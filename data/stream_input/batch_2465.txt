B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love Game of Thrones series. It's a little dark but the actors do a great job and the costuming is very cool.
B00498YZH8|4.0|Not much to say here. If you are looking to get a bit depressed, watch this movie. If you enjoy good acting, watch this movie.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Season 2 of a good legal series starring excellent cast of actors.  Interesting story lines, fascinating legal cases, romantic plots.  I highly recommend it!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|It was okay, not as good as they made it out to be. Tom Cruise is just not that exciting.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great show for legal show junkies.  Very good actors, interesting legal cases, good story lines with romantic interest as well.  I highly recommend it!
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Hopkins is great, as were all the other actors. It was nice to learn a bit about Hitchcock's life and career.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I started out by saying this was not my favorite Josh Groban, but now it has grown on me to the point that I can honestly say it is one of my favorites.  I don't think there is one song that I don't just love.  I highly recommend it!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This movie surpasses the play.  I had seen Le Mis three times on stage: in London, at the Kennedy Center and Signature Theater.  While I loved the play, the film makes the plot a lot more understandable.  Anne Hathaway's performance was superb as was Hugh Jackman's.  Russel Crowe, while not a great singer, did his best.  This story for the generations is a beautiful adaptation of a heart wrenching story.  I have already watched it two times and plan to do watch it at least once a year to cleanse my soul.
B005HV6Y84|3.0|I bought this CD for one song - #6....A Thousand Years.  It is a beautiful song and I play it almost daily.  Frankly, I have not listened to any other songs on this CD. 5 Stars for A Thousand Years and for the rest, who knows.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Loved this book.  Have recommended it to friends.  It casts a spell on the reader.  Couldn't put it down.  Well written, engaging and  luminous in every respect.  Having sisters of my own made it even more compelling.

B0044C3RB4|5.0|I got hooked on Fringe after starting to watch it on Amazon Instant Video. The plot is very unpredictable, which makes it a joy to watch because you really don't know what's just around the corner. Most shows end up keeping me at the edge of my seat till the end, with a very few episodes which aren't as great, but a good set to watch over all.
B0073COMKW|5.0|I'm switching my lights out for LEDs.  These were nice and bright in my bathroom and will definitely buy more.
B008R5OKI8|4.0|Most of us haven't heard of this &#34;new&#34; violinist on the scene... Sinovsky (a Russian) is a paired with an Italian ensemble (Il Pom d'oro) with good results. While the orchestra plays their part in the production well, most of the attention is brought to the athletic requirements Vivaldi placed in the soloists hands. Pisendel was no doubt a virtuoso, and Sinovsky takes the opportunity to play-up the virtuosity in many of the tight spaces Vivaldi leaves open.<br /><br />I didn't think the &#34;style&#34; of the playing was quite &#34;right&#34; in every nook and cranny, so I can't say it's a &#34;5 star&#34; performance. Perhaps if the soloist and orchestra continued to play together that a better synergy and style could emerge. But I'm picky - of all the recent solo albums (Volumes III-V), I think the music presented here (by Vivaldi) is the most interesting and worth auditioning.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|Spartacus is one of the best series ever made, all the characters are wonderfull rhey all play part in ur heart. I have no words to fulfilled my descriptions I just love love love this show. Nothing compares to it ! After wathing the first season you want to see more is addictive hahhaha best ever !!!! And crixus is the best character you will love him and dislike him in some parts but he is a wonderfull guy at the end !!!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|You can't anticipate what will happen next...Urban legends, weird science, strange people (that you might have met) is all there.<br />Fun - discussion provoking...Enjoy!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love watching &#34;Once Upon a Time&#34;,  every episode is so exciting and I am always upset when the end credits roll because I don't want it to end.  We watch as a family and we have all made an agreement that no one can watch a new episode unless we are all there together,  which is really special for me.  The only thing about that is even though there isn't alot of bad language in the show it wouldn't hurt to get rid of the little bit that is there,  it defenitely would not take away from the content of the show.  Besides that, no complaints,  except for I would love to see more of Captain Hook on the show (just an added bonus).  I can't wait for Season 3!

I'm sure they wanted someone young and naive sounding, but I would have thought they would have gone for a sexier voice, especially when she was reading his lines. Nineteen hours and forty seven minutes of listening to that would have been excruciating.
0307476073|4.0|Surprisingly I liked this book as did most people in my book club group... many of us were not expecting to... I thought it was well written and interesting... there were a few jarring notes which frankly I still wonder about... the biggest from me was how she just quit heroin and didn't seem much bothered by it.. she says that she was lucky...hard to believe for me... but... I give her the benefit of the doubt... the trip was definitely a way for her to strip down to her basics... and to renew herself... I would definitely recommend the book... especially if you like to read about journey's of self in trospection and knowledge.. a good book...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game. It definitely reminded me of some of the old PC puzzle games. I had a great time with it for sure.

B00A83075M|5.0|This was sent to my grandson in another state as a gift.  What can I say, it's WRECK-IT RALPH.  A great movie for kids.  He loves it.  It came right on time and was packaged well.
B00C1S945G|4.0|It all started getting better once Riker grew a beard, I still think Dr. Pulaski and her more McCoy take on the Chief Medical Officer was a breath of fresh air from this show's original warm and fuzzy mandate that Roddenberry stressed. People don't argue in the future? Then how the hell do you have a decent drama??

B00BLSJI80|5.0|I've always mediocrely appreciated Ms. Demi ever since she was just a lass on the Disney Channel. She had everything that Hillary Duff, Miley Montana and Miranda Cosgrove didn't have: class, baby! I was oh-so sad to hear about her psychological problems that she suffered when she was on that Disney Channel show of hers that ended up getting retooled because of her eating disorder and personal-life turmoil, which seems to be a prerequisite for this little lasses in showbiz these days.<br /><br />I'm so overjoyed to comprehend that she's now back and stronger than ever with her first CD in almost 2 years (it was a long wait!!), on which she sexes it up so much with her bad-girl image makeover and her tattooes, which had me all wet...from perspiration. Oh yes, yes, Demi...you're such a big girl now, aren't you? Rowr, baby.<br /><br />All the songs on Demi are so camp and sassy that they can easily be featured on Kidz Bop Volume 37, but not Kidz bop Volume 43! The quality of the songs is so masterful that they should be featured on Hot Problems' newest CD or maybe even Rebecca Black's newest CD, when record execs finally realize that Rebecca is the greatest singer who ever lived!!<br /><br />I love how all the songs on this CD are all about pressing issues that young girls can relate to, thereby making Demi still a very powerful role model that parents can put their faith in. For instance, on Something That We're Not, Demi sassily croons about sex; on Fire Starter, she croons some more about sex; and on Never Been Hurt, she croons about (you guessed it) rough sex. Other songs deal with equally relatable and topical teen-girl issues such as eating disorders, Mean Girls-style bullying, wearing too much makeup, acting like a b----, and stealing your best girlfriend's boyfriend, miha!<br /><br />In short, it's best that you purchase this CD from Amazon right this second. You'll treat your ears to the awesome, sonic experience of Disney Channel-style musical arrangements, Nickelodeon-style \\"mature\\" lyrics, teenage studio musician playing quality, and, best of all, My Little Pony-type subject matter.ckelodeon-style \\"mature\\" lyrics, teenage studio musician playing quality, and, best of all, My Little Pony-type subject matter.
B00COHIFQS|3.0|the acting is solid - both from the adults leads and the two young girls around whom the story centers.  the effects are satisfying - not over the top, just reasonably creepy.  the story is fairly well developed - with a few of the inevitable questions that spawn post-film discussion/arguments.  they avoided the tidy happily-ever-after ending.  worth seeing...
1401216676|5.0|Get this book is really good and the ending is the best part in my opinion. This is the history  of the joker
B00ARAO1LC|4.0|a good mix of harsh and ridiculous - plenty of laughs and cringes.  well-cast and well-directed.  not a fan of Matthew McConaughey, in general.  but he makes a fine sleaze-ball in this.  not recommended for the easily offended...

B009EJSUBY|5.0|Do you love Van  Cliburn's recording of &#34;the&#34; Tchaikovsky piano concerto?  There was a lot more to VC than just his good looks and his celebrity.  He was a brilliant pianist whose celebrity provoked the catiest reactions from the classical establishment.  Today  Richter is worshipped as a pianist and yet people do not acknowledge Richter's role in Van Cliburn's win.  It was Richter's first and only assignment as a juror in a piano contest.  All of the judges were supposed to vote on a ten point scale.  Being polite they gave everyone scores betwee 9 and 10.  When Richter heard Van Cliburn, he opined this man is a genius; everyone else is a dumbell.  So he scored Van Cliburn 100 and everyone else  zero.  After that, Richter was never invited to judge a piano contest again.<br />Van Cliburn was a master of the Russian romantic reportoire.  Here is every studio recording he ever made for RCA and that is all of them or almost all of his studio recordings.  There  are a number of wonderful recordings.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I have.

B004WJRTXG|4.0|I like the way Doug relentlessly defends his right to be sad and down in the dumps. Don't meddle, don't interfere. It takes a twin sister to break through. All the reasoning is very sound and whoever has experienced deep grief knows what he's talking about. The observation on modern living is very accurate and a bit depressing in all its clarity.<br />And all this with a brilliant wit.<br />Thanks.
193700788X|5.0|When I read the blurb before it was released, I expected more violence!  Ending was great! I won't give any spoilers to ruin it for any who haven't read.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love having access to HD movies through Prime! Especially when I am already following a series like Hunger Games. Great visual translation of the book. I expect them to progress even more as the next movie looks even more entertaining and more true to the book.

1573229725|3.0|Fingersmith was a very unusual book. It is not the kind of book I usually read. I enjoyed the first part of the book more than the latter part. It is strangely interesting. I didn't feel any connection with the characters, however. This is my first Sarah Waters book, and I intend to read Night Watch next.

1451695195|5.0|We were intrigued by this book. Here is a neurologist who thought is was ok for people who got comfort by the near death expericences because it comforted them. He never thought they were real. So, when he get desparely sick, calls out to God for help, and then gets to see the afterlife for real, he has to work that into his life from before. It is very good to see and hear this from a scientist and a neuro-surgeon.
1742200508|5.0|I have been wanting to do a trip to England for a couple of years now, and this book was perfect for giving me lots of great ideas of things to do and places to go.  The book is divided up by regions and gives thorough detailed information about a variety of things to do in each regions, which makes planning very exciting.  The book goes into detail about the transportation options, which I think is particularly helpful, and it goes through different types of things to do, from nature-based, museums, pop culture (there is quite a bit of discussion about the Beatles in the Liverpool section, but other sections have nice tie-ins with other \\"popular\\" culture places of interest such as where various tv shows were filmed), and places that are popular with tourists (like the palaces and castles) and more off the beaten path such as very old historic pubs, special shops, and the like. There are nice descriptions with just the right amount of detail (not too much, not too little) about what makes each region distinctive and special) and really does seem more thorough and up-to-date compared to other guides I have looked at.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book is great.  I'll know for sure after I make a trip to England (no definitive time set yet), but this is an essential book for planning where to go and what to do when I get there.

B00BSBY38A|5.0|What a beautiful movie; the photography is stunning; a combination of real and technological images. Pi brings his unique perspective to life and yet understands how his father's values and perspective also has meaning.  A story of hope versus defeat.
098478280X|5.0|Its not a textbook but provides good problem solving with multiple solutions. I like the way she has presented solutions with different complexities and running times with and without buffer.

0812982622|4.0|This is a page turner. Hart to stop reading. In periods, I had to stay and read, that's how exciting it was, at times.<br />From modern psychology perspective, the Author was using the usual tricks to impress journalists and critics: exaggerations noble art, combined with everything that is disgusting for human beings. Lots of blood, mucus, eating moths, eating sperm of animals to survive, also drain blood, and all the things we humans instinctively reject. It's the only way you can wake up a Journalist, from their daily stories about misery and violence. The Pulitzer prize was for sure by this move. There are so many aspects, this why the novel is not leaving the head at once.<br /><br />This novel shows the surrealistic everyday of people in a dictatorship. It's written from several perspectives - with associated language patterns from every perspective. Some times it fits to the normal communistic rhetoric, sometimes it is easy identifiable as exaggerated western propaganda. Western propaganda is not better - just slightly more subtle. American cars declared as the best of the world, is just american propaganda. If it was true, Detroit was not in deep trouble now... The propaganda on both sites about who is the most democratic country is also part of the everyday life, around the world. Who defines this highly subjective matter? In the Airport today, I feel we have lost all our human rights - also in the west. We have a constant stream of propaganda in our speaker too. The safety of our country and alleged terrorist threats justifying all the new laws. A slow curtailment of civil liberties occur slowly every day.<br /><br />No one in uniform is wiser or better educated, than the people they rule over or feel beyond. It is perhaps a part of feeling like a little person and finally getting some power and finally being seen and heard.<br />The novel shows us, how every single human is creating a map of the world, from the random knowledge he or she has collected during the lifetime. So when North-korean people are truly wondering about, why cities in America don't even have rationing offices, ration stamps, whilst we are wondering, why they do not have all the luxury, what is normal here in the West...<br /><br />In the end it's all about some humans think they are much more then others. Different rules for the guys who control others. In Noth-Korea, nobody is save. In the western countries all the secret services can be sure getting good pensions - no matter what they have done.<br />Who controls the controller in our countries? We use different methods. There are many free services on internet today, collecting data about: who is connected to who and why, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, meeting calendars, clouds - all this collected data is centralized and easy to monitor by who ever is interested from the government. Free services spending billions $ collecting our data. Where comes the money from, to buy all this servers ? A much more subtle way to control the western countries and citizens today. Just one mad man like Hitler can today rule the world on a much more comprehensive, but brutal way - and nobody can hide anymore, because we have shown our complete network to the world, show what we like and buy and our complete life pattern.<br /><br />This novel shows, what we can expect, when we stop fighting for democracy. It has always being tempting for small people with an huge Ego like Kim Il ..., to rule a country with a only a little group of supporters, by only using propaganda, terror and fear. It really doesn't matter whether we have a workers paradise in the east, pointing at the misery in the west, or we have a consume paradise in the west, pointing at the misery in the east. it is just the surface. Under the surface it can be rotten on both sides....<br /><br />This book holds up a mirror of human vanity, weaknesses and strengths and shows us also, when we focusing on the faults of others, we are free to see our ownin the West...<br />And all of this and much more wrapped into a super exciting novel, with many funny passages and is a must to read and discuss in 2013.<br />No matter what political view, color, religious beliefs or gender. Perhaps we can create a better word together, instead of this hopeless madness of a North-korean nightmare,<br />where a few man keeping an entire population locked in, as their own personal property - as their private livestock - and still think in 2013, they are a sovereign country, where no one should interfere ...<br />I thing the time is over for this guys... people are longing for the same values and love today, all over the world.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|This is a great series!  It will definitely be compared to Game of Thrones, but it is much more realistic and focused!
1400049628|5.0|The Zombie Survival Guide is a book full of both Humor and seriously good tactics that you could use in a dire emergency where the normal 'Rule Of Law' is suspended, or no longer applies. By the time you finish this book, you should have a different outlook on how prepared you truly are for a real emergency. It would be a good book to introduce someone to the practice of 'prepping', a.k.a. preparing for emergencies like Natural Disaters, Civil Unrest, or Industrial Accidents where you may have to evacuate your home. The book focuses more on personal protection for the most part, but hints to the other types of  emergencies that could occur in real life.
B002XMGGJM|4.0|A man (Gerard Butler) watches as his wife and daughter are raped and killed. When a plea deal is struck that sets one of his family's killers free, he decides to take justice into his own hands. He targets not only the killer but also anyone else involved in striking the plea deal. This means many people will face the wrath of Clyde Shelton (okay, that's no &#34;Hannibal Lecter&#34; but boy, does he know how to out-think...plus he doesn't eat his kills.).<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie or know how/who kills these people while Clyde is in isolation in prison, then it will be a very enjoyable  view. it does not hold up on repeated viewings because, well, like with magic, once you know how the trick is done, it is not so impressive.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it is an absolutely worthwhile watch.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It has great information and insight while pointing to research and sources to back it up. The personal experiences shared allow you to relate and understand.
B003UESJHY|4.0|BioPics are tough. If you cover too long a period of time, then the picture becomes too thin in terms of dialogue. If you cover too short a period of time, then the picture becomes but a chapter and tends to have too much crammed in. Like I said, it is a tough balance. Director Dvid O. Russell (who just won praise for &#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34;) balances the story of suffering brother/boxer Mickey (Mark Wahlberg) and his new romance with the empowering Amy Adams played against Mickey's half brother Dickey (Christian Bale) and mother (Melissa Leo). Dickey is known as a former boxer who once fought Sugar Ray Leonard. Unfortunately, along with Dickey comes his drug addiction to crack and Melissa Leo as his enabling mother who is so proud of Dickie's past that she does a terrible job as Mickey's current manager.<br /><br />Both Bale and Leo deserved the Oscar's they won which, by itself, make this a movie worth seeing. However, Amy Adams is also terrific as is the texture of the editing and the screenplay. The movie starts off by introducing the major events via a documentary that is being shot by HBO on Dickey. He thinks it is about his &#34;comeback&#34; to the ring when in fact, it is about Dickey's fall to drugs.<br /><br />Regardless of what version of the film you purchase, you can supplement it by simply visiting YouTube. There, you can watch the original HBO documentary that details Dicky Eklund's fall into drugs as well as the fights re-enacted for the movie. Where the movie stops after Micky's 2000 fight against Shea Neary, you can also view on YouTube the Ring Magazine's 2001 Fight of the Year (Ward beats Emanuel Augustus), Ring Magazine's 2002 Fight of the Year (Ward beats Arturo Gatti) and Ring Magazine's 2003 Fight of the Year (Arturo Gatti beats Ward).<br /><br />Like I said, Biopics are tough. David O. Russell nailed this one. It is well worth the time. If you like the sweet science (hello fellas), this is a movie worth watching. If boxing isn't your thing (hello ladies), there are two REALLY STRONG  female leads in Amy Adams and Melissa Leo. In addition, the women who portray the sisters/half-sisters are as tough as nails. Their real life nicknames are Red Dog, Tar, Pork, Beaver, Boo Boo and Little Alice. Damn, that sounds like a prison gang in which I wold keep my distance. But fear not as they only exist on your TV screen. Worth a rental, perhaps even a buy if the price is right. Enjoy!our thing (hello ladies), there are two REALLY STRONG  female leads in Amy Adams and Melissa Leo. In addition, the women who portray the sisters/half-sisters are as tough as nails.

193700788X|2.0|This series was my very first paranormal romance series. I fell in love with the characters, and being from the south, I identified with Ms. Harris in a lot of ways.  However, this series really started going down hill after about book nine. There was absolutely no \\"southern vampire romance\\" at all. I still held onto the hope that the author would pull out all the stops at the end. Like 99% of the other readers, this final book is hugely disappointing. Of all the people for Sookie to end up with, SAM??? And when did my ultimate bad boy Eric turn into a submissive whiner, bowing to his new queen like he had no backbone??? I'm a huge reader. I usually will go back to my favorites and read them over and over. I can honestly say I will never re-read this series again. I feel like the author just got tired of writing about this series and threw something together. For those of us that invested years, money, and devotion to the series, we deserved better. For all of y'all looking for an actual vampy romance, check out Karen Chance, Molly Harper, or Jeanienne Frost. It seems these authors actually want to do something with their characters....

1439190275|5.0|Easier to read.<br />Easier to understand.<br />Less restricted.<br />Well written and easy to understand.<br /><br />Really like this book.  The steps to take are so much easier.  Just read through each phase, follow the guidelines and voila!  Weight loss.<br /><br />IMPORTANT- this book DOES NOT state you have to buy the Atkins bars, shakes, or frozen dinners.  In fact, discourages excessive use of all.  The Atkins items have nothing to do with the diet, just as if you select not to eat a vegetable that is on the accepted foods list.  AND excessive shakes and bars, along with some sugar substitutes will indeed stall your weight loss.  That is stated in the chapter \\"induction\\".  The first step in the process.<br /><br />Luck to everyone who tries this, and low carb.  If you stick with it, you will be amazed at how much better you feel.

0345803485|3.0|I was disappointed with this book that received so much attention. It was a bit disturbing from the aspect of how much this man controls this young woman - not healthy. And I feel sorry for those readers who hung on its every word because their marriages or relationships are so lacking. Women nowadays should be ASKING their men for what they want and need....not relying on a book to fill their fantasies!! It provided a few new ideas for me but I am very fortunate enough to already be in a sexually exciting (and loving & respectful) relationship.........

B00CHNKJFO|4.0|I'm not huge into pinball games but if it's Star Wars themed I'm game. I found just getting into the game was a little clunky. It took me a few minutes just to figure out how to use the plunger. It does not work right. You launch the ball by igniting a lightsaber. The problem is it is intermittent. Do you flick the lightsaber button fast or slow? Either way you seem to get different results. I found the best practice was to slowly slide my finger down the lightsaber.<br /><br />Now that the ball was in play I was in for another challenge. Just keeping track of what was going on was daunting. There's so many lights and things flashing. Add to that random Star Wars sound bites and your senses get a little overloaded. This game made me feel really old. Mainly because I knew what I was supposed to be doing but had no control of how to do it. Ok I need to take out the droid, uuuh how? I eventually just started flicking the pinballs around hoping something good would happen. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn't. Maybe that's pinball. In the end I had fun and hungered for more. There are camera angles to change views so you can get a better look at what is going on. I couldn't really find a happy medium of one that worked the best.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Production Quality is Great<br />Fun<br />Star Wars Themed<br /><br />Cons:<br />Hard to launch the pinball<br />Confusing and difficult<br />Help Instructions are too brief. There is a help section but it needs to be more extensive. Not everyone has played video pinball before. It would be nice to have a strategy guide or some walkthrough instructions.<br /><br />In the end I recommend this game. It's very addictive. It's pretty difficult. If you love challenges and have to beat games to be satisfied, May The Force Be With You.

B007IV11PM|5.0|I couldn't help but miss David Tennant the first few episodes, but the new Dr. definitely makes it his own. Seriously though, how much does this review matter to you. If you are thinking of getting into Dr. Who, why would you start here, go back to when the starting making episodes again (Chis Ecc....). If you have watched the previous seasons then you're probably an idiot if you are debating whether or not to keep watching.

193700788X|1.0|For me it's been mighty difficult framing a review on one single book in a long running series. I just can't stop referring back to the earlier books and its making me agitated. One would think each book of any series would be building toward a resounding end where the protagonist's and other beloved characters' problems would be resolved for the better. But this is not the case with the Southern Vampire Mysteries (SVM) series. Or is it the Sookie Stackhouse Novels? Or is it True Blood Books? I can't seem to get a straight answer on this. Another thing no one can answer is what was the intended purpose of this long running series.<br />Here's a little background, I was introduced to the SVM series after not liking True Blood and hearing that the books were much better. In a matter of weeks, I was hooked under the ruse that the vampires represented a marginalized group in this fictitious world and the protagonist, Sookie Stackhouse, was the marginalized telepath bridging the divide, at least in Bon Temps, Louisiana. She was also good at connecting the dots and courageous in the face of adversity. The writing, especially in the earlier books, is fast pace with an easy storytelling style. The authors assumed voice could at times be quaint but funny; so much, so that I let the inconsistencies here and there slide. Trusting that it all would be explained at the end. At the culmination of an over a decade long investment that wouldn't dream of leaving the author, her characters, and the fans walking away from the series with hurt feelings, dashed expectations, and disillusionment about the redeeming value of a 13 book series.<br />I have questioned, and thought, and rethought, and reread and I've come to the same conclusion every time. Charlaine Harris never truly cared for this story and this fiasco of an ending is because the SVM series is a GIMMICK - a TRICK - a PLOY - a STUNT - to:<br />A. Advance careers; and<br />B. Make money off of the unsuspecting VERMIN - Me<br/>Since learning the spoilers from Dead Ever After and interacting with the fandom (something I've never done), I've come to understand that it really didn't matter whether I read:<br />Dead Until Dark,<br />Living Dead In Dallas,<br />Club Dead,<br />Dead To The World,<br />Dead As A Doornail,<br />Definitely Dead,<br />All Together Dead,<br />And yes, I am going to type each title out to illustrate my frustration with this entire series from beginning to end. Now back to the still ever growing list of books I purchased and read:<br />From Dead to Worse,<br />Dead And Gone,<br />Dead In The Family,<br />Dead Reckoning,<br />Deadlocked,<br />Dead Ever After<br />Count them, and then recount them again. God help me I just can't finish the last book in this series knowing that my initial investment didn't lay the breadcrumbs to the ending.  I can't continue to read when what any of the characters said, did, or felt, Charlaine Harris conveniently forgets rules, conversations, and characterization whenever it suits her needs. Just as I began to question her sense, I learn there are a number of books written on the side that were important to the series, you see. Yes, all you unsuspecting souls that wear many hats in life and know that time and money are in short supply. There are a ton of `Novellas' written by the author that have plot driving information contained within - Oh the deviousness. What you didn't know?! No. The novellas or the Sam Side Stories (SSS) as I've come to call them are actually important to the outcome of the series. But wait, wouldn't it have been good form, and honest, for readers to have known the importance of these SSS Novellas in their favorite series. Should they have read?:<br />If I Had A Hammer, Small Town Wedding, and the other Novellas I wasn't made to care about, and now that the series is over, they matter. Man that's some honest dealing, I tell ya. There are hundreds if not thousands of other readers that were in the dark like me.<br />Dearies not only is the SVM series a gimmick it is also deceptive. The SSS story lines ought to have been added to the main books if they were so important to the outcome of the series.  If there were words, actions, and/or hints that affected the protagonist life, and had some bearing on the ending, then lengthen the body of the 12 books, or add more books to the original series. (Shoot we were willing to read 13 books, why would we stop there?)<br />Or if all else fails, here's a better idea, stick to the rules and the history of the original series to remain honest with the fans. See I enjoy paranormal romance because it's an escape and ignites my imagination. In fantasy and make believe the skies the limit, right?<br />But folks honesty in the SVM is not the best policy - the name of the series conveniently changed to fit the mood of the author over time. At first it was a series about a marginalized telepath meeting, working and loving marginalized vampires that had conveniently \\"come out of the coffin\\" (vampire increased popularity in romantic fiction). After that was used to the point of being bothersome for Ms. Harris, it became a series about supernatural mysteries solved by the protagonist alone with the vampires this time being marginalized by the author. Then at the end, the story is about Sookie Stackhouse and her journey or lack thereof. The series changed focused three times over the years. As a consequence it became over marketed as it tried to be everything and anything to attract readers = $.<br />1. Hey if you like paranormal and vampire books, then the Southern Vampire Mystery series is for you. Don't listen to the author when she says in interviews that she thinks it's stupid to date vampires - as if it's actually a real choice women have. (I still can't believe she said this about her own protagonist and actually meant it. No wonder the ending is so uninspiring.)<br />2.  Hey if you like romance, then the Southern Vampire Mystery series isfor you. Don't listen to the author when she says she doesn't write romance, she's just being coy. (Yes, listen to the author and you should disregard the books altogether, particularly the ones that have any romantic situations or themes, just read Dead Until Dark and Dead Ever After.)<br />3.  Hey if you like a fantasy with a social conscious twist, then the Southern Vampire Mystery series...well, you get the idea.<br />In reality the SVM series was never any of the things it was marketed to be but a GIMMICK to entice the VERMIN - the unsuspecting Paranormal Romance fans to read Charlaine Harris' novels. A gimmick to attract people like me who see no problem with human vampire `relations' in a fantasy that takes place in a small town during modern times, people like me that like happy endings or traceable surprises, and people like me that appreciate the subtext of social conscience in a light read.  But instead of the above SVM was a stunt, and strategically planned and played out with the consent of Charlaine Harris. Then finally after 15 years and 13 books, Ms. Harris decides that she needs to be true to herself and write a fitting ending to a convoluted, deceptive and money grabbing series. And that is how Dead Ever After was conceived and why it reads so horribly.<br />Now for those of you still supporting Charlaine Harris and perceive no problem in her career stunt, I can only say to each their own. But the online fan interaction, and chats at forums and book signings, was asinine behavior on her part. Perhaps it would not have been a problem if Ms. Harris didn't use that time to correct, change, or alter the series to fix her poorly done writing. To this day, I can't read anything related to SVM without someone adding this precursor \\"Well Charlaine Harris did say....\\" Excuse me but I thought what only mattered was what Charlaine Harris wrote in the 12 proceeding books.<br />I, like others, have never attended Ms. Harris' book signings and forums. There areplenty of interviews online and in print that I have never seen nor read. Ever considered that some people live too far to attend a signing or can't even afford the trip, or simply don't have the time to do so. Some live in rural communities where libraries are far away, or closed down, and the internet is a luxury to afford. Ever consider that the one book a year was all some people could afford?<br />I am not a personal fan of Charlaine Harris. I was a fan of the characters she created, and I enjoyed catching up with them over the 6 years of reading the series. I wouldn't know about all the internet talk and the SSS books. All of which would have been fine if it were not being used to tell the story the author couldn`t show; just bad form all around, Charlaine.<br />So folks I end this series with not so happy thoughts about it. Like the major characters in Dead Ever After, I feel used and short changed. Both of which are feelings that are not usually associated with paranormal romance. But considering all I've learned over the last two weeks I was never supposed to feel good about this series. Because although it was conceived to entice readers like me, in actuality the author thinks that I'm VERMIN - a pest and a nuisance. Charlaine Harris has neither respect for me as a reader nor as a consumer. It isn't enough that I purchased and promoted her series for over 6 years. It isn't enough that she gained legends of fans that eerily hold on to her every word. And it isn't enough that for 15 years she has grown in stature and income. Nothing, not even love, is enough for her to stop seeing the fans and readers as VERMIN.<br />With that said Ms. Harris, consider yourself now bug free.<br />One Star, not even a bookshelf positioned series.

B009NY43NY|1.0|What other adjectives can I come up with to describe this ending to what WAS a great series? Disappointing. Boring. Lackluster. Shall I go on?<br /><br />What happened, Charlaine?!? I am totally ticked that I wasted money on this book. It's like someone else wrote this book.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Cumberbatch and Freeman give Downey and Law a run for their money are the dynamic duo of deductive reasoning. The modern retelling of the Conan Doyle story is wonderfully handled. The neurosis of Holmes as opposed to Freeman's grounding demeanor make the pair wonderful to watch. Cumberbatch and his OCD in noticing every detail is a true sight to behold. Crisp writing and great acting add to the total enjoyment of this show. Can't wait to watch more.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|It's difficult to get people to give this book a real shot. It uses a lot of flowery language that makes it come off as a self help or new age guru thing at first. But you have to resist that perception and push on. The language is purposeful because it starts to open up a new type of dialogue that we should be using to communicate with each other and with ourselves. Among other things, this book is about finding new and powerful ways to overcome the many many frustrations of life. It's about realizing that each of us have much more control over the things that happen to us than we've been conditioned to believe. What it did for me was foster a complete change in the way I think about and approach any potential conflict. And that has resulted in a massive change in my interpersonal relationships and my emotional well being. I can't recommend this book enough if you're serious about changing your perspective.

B00729GQ0A|2.0|I saw that this book had good ratings, but I personally did not enjoy reading it.  Since fantasy, mystery and suspense books are my favorites, I use the ratings guide to select what books I purchase.  I don't know why it got such good ratings.  I think it was a mediocre book at best.

B006LG7GIQ|5.0|Kate Winslet dazzled as Juliet, and one can see why she went on to become the actress that everyone knows and loves. Her intensity and complete transformation into the character is at times disturbing and exciting.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great setting and story, but a little disappointed on ending.  The flow and character development felt immature.  But, all in all an enjoyable read.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Good quality, buffering time was fine.  Price is still too high for such things, paying $4 more to keep from having to go to Redbox...

B0026NBZEY|3.0|Keeps Waters' themes of the supernatural, women's entrapment, and love between women alive, but dreary beyond belief.  Not as good as Fingersmith.
B0095P341S|5.0|Our son is a little Iron Man freak at four years old.  Iron man big boy underwear part of potty training.  He has constumes, action figures.  He will tell you is is Iron Man or Tony Stark ...<br /><br />As an adult, we love the series.  There is some great eye candy for Mom.  Awesome action sequences for Dad.  And a great hero for the toddler - who does a crazy dance when all &#34;both&#34; iron man's have to fight.
B008QPCCQQ|1.0|The index is improperly linked, and navigation is abysmal. I've never had such problems with a Kindle product before. Although I adore Alcott's books, I'll get them in paper rather than try to deal with the hassle of this version.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|The Russian, sword-wielding Santa with reindeer that looked crazy wild was awesome.  6 foot Aussie/ninja Easter Bunny still makes the child laugh.<br /><br />This is watched monthly now, and our toddler will regularly grab sticks and be &#34;Jack Frost&#34;.  This is quite a feat given he is usually only Iron Man.  He asks if Sandman will come give him good dreams.<br /><br />At this age, i don't think our son was getting the whole &#34;believe or not believe&#34; or the power of faith.  He understood something bad was happening, but to him it was just the bad guy stopping the good guys from doing their work (not how that work affected all the kids).<br /><br />Still - he will watch it for the entire length, and that is the hallmark of a great movie to me.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Good story but I had a hard time sticking with it. Nothing like the tv show but interesting about the diamonds

B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This movie was so inspirational it made me want to be a body guard- so my husband and I both went to our communiy colledge and looked into it.

B00005JO20|5.0|This film will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end-the action is superb and gripping from moment to moment. The story is no new story but every King Kong out there has his own way of handling the beauty he is entranced by. That's what keeps us coming back for every new one that comes out. I'm waiting for this movie to come out in 3-D-imagine that!!! I love this movie.

B0097UO87U|5.0|Ever a master of texture, Lynne has created a beautiful and moving listening experience.  Great choice of classic songs, sung and played flawlessly.

I'm glad I got this on mp3, because if it were physical media I'd be sure to wear it out.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|I.LOVED.IT<br />This was so different from the other books that I was reading. Of course it had the love/romance aspect but it also had SO.MUCH.MORE.<br />It had characters that were so well-rounded and amazing that there was not a character in the book that I did not love.<br />Layken was a very stubborn teenager (those really exist?? NO WAY!! haha) she was still in pain from losing her father and she was forced into a role as the rock, the comforter, the strong one for everyone else while she internally held onto her emotions. She didn't want to move away from the only home she has ever known and start a new school where she would not know anyone. But on the first day of her move she meets her quite delicious neighbor, Will.<br />Will takes care of his brother while working to finish his degree. He works hard and does not have time for anything other than school, work, and his brother Caulder. When he enters Layken's life, not only is her world turned upside down but so is Will's.<br />They are so amazing together but when things happen and they are torn apart before they can even get started, you are left feeling heart broken for both of them.<br />Layken has to deal with a lot in this book: grief, forgiveness, heartbreak, and you are feeling every emotion right along with her.<br />This book was so emotional and I cried buckets, I couldn't put it down and if anyone tried to get my attention while I read, they were liable to get their heads chewed off.. I just loved every stinkin minute of this book, especially the poetry..<br />OH the poetry was epic and I pretty much highlighted the whole book by the end.<br />The ending is happy and the readers are left wanting more which brings me into the next one<br /><br />FOR MY FULL REVIEW GO TO:<br />[...]
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This is one excellent read. Gillian Flynn is a very clever author.  I loved how the story was wrote from the perspective of both the main characters and right up to the end I was guessing the outcome.  I would not hesitate to recommend this book.  Excellent.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My 6-year-old daughter LOVES this app and it certainly keeps her amused.  The people who are getting their hair done sound like they love it EVEN MORE, though!
B005CRQ3H0|1.0|Boring. Horrible. Terrible.  Dull.  Studpid.  I only read this for a class.  The professor also said he hated reading it.
B002361MLA|5.0|If you are searching for a connection with our eternal source, this is a pointer. This is my second copy, I gave my first one away to someone who didn't comprehend the concepts! I enjoy going back to read a bit here and there, quite often.
B006M4F67A|5.0|i really enjoyed this game, and the fact that they have so many different puzzles was great! very glad i took advantage of this as the free app yesterday.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was so anxious to read this book as I had read several reviews.  It is certainly an &#34;easy read&#34; and the story keeps your interest with several twists and turns.<br />I enjoyed it very much and it was the first book I have read by this author. I am likely to read her other novels now.
B00CKJTOHO|3.0|The show is great but the picture quality not so great as the image is very dark especially for night scenes.  I was expecting better quality for the streaming video image.
B006OOHYIC|3.0|This is a fun game to play that is totally RELAXING. I did not realize that if you use the help button then it will cost you coins and when you run out  you are forced to buy more coins. Still lots of fun.<br />For the most part it is challenging without having to think too much.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|great movie arrived in the post before it hit the stores here have watched it a couple of times cannot wait for the next movie
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Awesome story<br />Awesome Cast<br />Awesome Director<br />Leo FTW<br />I love Christopher Walts in this movie<br />Samuel L. Jackson, love him in this movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait for season 4!!! Outstanding cast and beautifully set scenes! I'm definitely a Dowton Abbey fan after this purchase!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Great movie. My daughter loves it. The video is high quality, and reasonable price. We will definitely rent more from Amazon.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like this game. It gives my mind a challenge and I really like completing each stage. It is fun to play!
B00CM96A60|5.0|Armin is a fantastic DJ in the Trance genre, and many would make a solid case that he is the best. This CD would support Armin as one of the top artists in the genre. I am admittedly biased as AVB has been one of my favorites since I began listening to EDM, and if you were never a fan of this genre (or Armin in general) this CD is certainly not going to awaken you to the entire genre. If, however, you are a fan of Trance music, and/or Armin, you have to give this CD a listen. The album when considered in entirety is fantastic, I would say the first few tracks flow together quite seamlessly, and by the time you get to \\"Alone\\" they have begun to sound much more like individual tracks than a blended/prog session (but this CD is not touted as a mixed session). In total this CD is another fantastic effort by Armin, one that is destined to stay in my player for quite some time, and then revisited frequently thereafter. Enjoy!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the acting, costumes, drama...and the dog is cute.  Intriguing story lines to follow and you start to care how it ends up.

B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game has achieved its standard of something to pass my time and pushed past that. the game play is fun and pretty free ranged. its a great hack and slasher. my main complaint is that its not very customizable as far as weopons and armor go but no game is as freerange as id like them to be inat aspect. all in all I good game that will keep you interested
B00CMKPNBC|5.0|French folk/jazz singer extraordinaire, Zaz simply hits it out of the park on her second studio album. I've followed Zaz for years, and must admit that I was scared that I might have over-hyped this album to myself. It's rare that a singer can maturely evolve their sound without losing their special essence. To my utter delight, there isn't a sophomore slump in sight on this album. This album samples a broader range of music genres than Zaz's self-titled debut, yet Zaz's soulful and emotive singing is front and center at all times.<br /><br />Musically wise, the first thing that struck me--was that this album was much more guitar driven as opposed to piano driven. I must admit that I miss the driving piano and think in general that you can hear much more emotion in a piano than from a guitar, but the fact of the matter is--these new more guitar focused songs are just flat out awesome. \\"La lessive\\" is subtle and controlled, yet keeps popping back into my head. I think I miss the more piano like songs, as they remind me a bit more of Edith Piaf, but this is a fresher sound for Zaz. While she can nail the sultry powerful cabaret siren, the wandering street minstrel seems to be a bit truer to who Zaz is as a person, and I think it shows in her music as well.<br /><br />\\"Si je perds\\" however is a haunting piano piece that just flows from the soul. Zaz is practically speaking, her tone is so light and soft yet the sorrow in her voice just cuts through. \\"Si\\" is another standout for me in a similar manner as \\"Si je perds\\" yet is a bit more forceful and gritty. Now, while Zaz's slower songs tend to be my favorites, I don't want to give the erroneous impression that this album is full of sad slow songs. Quite the contrary, about half of them are much more upbeat and incorporate a wide range of musical instruments like the cello, accordion and even some that I can't quite identify. \\"Nous debout\\" is an immediate standout that will definitely make you want to tap your toes and probably attempt to sing along as well.<br /><br />I do want to add that I don't speak or understand any French at all. Occasionally I hear a word that I may or may not recognize, but I certainly don't have any comprehension of what the songs are about unless I've previously looked the lyrics up. I write this to emphasize that Zaz simply makes music that transcends language. I would highly encourage anyone who enjoys Edith Piaf, Constance Amiot or even someone like Colbie Caillat to check out Zaz. Understanding of French not required to enjoy the beautiful and memorable experience that Zaz creates.robably attempt to sing along as well.<br /><br />I do want to add that I don't speak or understand any French at all.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I read this book because my book club was reading it. There are no redeeming characters here. In fact, the characters are really reprehensible people, ranging from simply sad to sociopaths. It was an interesting enough story, but the payoff was, 'Why did I read this?.' Please tell me a story without me feeling that I need a bath afterwards.
0316224588|4.0|A hiatus from Rebus seems to have been a good thing for Ian Rankin, because he brings the detective back in better form than he left him in 2008's Exit Music.  I had found myself losing interest in the series while reading the 4 or 5 last books before this one as Rebus became a shell of his original character.  Rankin was giving Siobhan Clarke a larger role and maker Rebus flatter.  In this book it was a relief to see most of the story from Rebus' view again, even though Rebus can be a very annoying character.  His constant disobeying orders and going rogue is a little tiresome, and that he always gets away with it seems unbelievable.  Still, those are the things that keep investigations moving and get him results.  Also, Rebus' personal habits (constant smoking, drinking too much, wearing the same clothes all the time) make me shudder.  But Rankin brought us back into Rebus' thoughts more than he had been doing in previous books, and that is where the real Rebus lies and where the complexity of his character can be valued--otherwise he is just a hard-drinking, chain-smoking slob determined to have things go his way.<br /><br />The plot in this book was good enough--women have been disappearing along the A9 highway north of Edinburgh.  Rebus, working as a civilian in the cold case section of the Police department, gets sucked into checking out the story brought to him by one of the young women's mothers, and then he has to get the real police involved.  Trying to keep the police on the right path when they want to go take the wrong investigative directions provides the usual ups and downs for Rebus.<br /><br />I enjoyed Rebus traveling between Edinburgh and the northern towns where the case was being investigated.  I even got out an atlas and checked out the locations mentioned. I also again enjoyed Rebus and Clarke working together, and it probably is good for Clarke, as she was gaining too much respectability and losing her edge.  Rebus' relationship with underworld figures continues, making him suspect to members of the internal affairs division.  Really, I found a lot to like in this installment in the Rebus series.<br /><br />If you are interested reviews of mystery series, check out my website listed in my profile.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I have read several books about North Korea, but this is the most intimate story so far.  Very moving and powerful.  Makes you question why everyone is so silent on North Korea, but also makes you realize it is because they are really only killing North Koreans, so nobody cares.
1451668945|5.0|she is such a wonderful writer, great book !!<br />I would say she has another winner of a book, good for her !
B00AQA94M4|4.0|I love their past releases but this cd has yet to grab me. It's good but doesn't keep my interest as past releases. Their live cd is the best to me. I still say buy this but he could've done better.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|My first read using this app. I like to set the font to white on black, at night I set the  brightness low to read in bed and not disturb my dh. If you set it to the least bright setting it goes completely black! Since you can't see, you can't fix it. I had to uninstall to it. So leaaon learned, right? Well it happened again w/o going into settings- I must have hit a shortcut. Needless to say, very irritating.

I don't know how I went without this CD for the 6 years that I did!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I think it should be watched by everyone.  The sets and the clothes and the cast become sooooo real when you're watching.
B006UV8DJS|1.0|Not really. what I expected ! Wouldn't exactly recommend it !! It's just Ok<br />I thought it would be spectacularly great but it's not ! Im quite disappointed with this one..
B006C1DH92|5.0|The first time when I play this game, it was a masterpiece. I love both Fruit Ninja: Puss in Boots, Fruit Ninja and Fruit Ninja Frenzy. U just had to slice fruits instead of BOMBS with your finger. I played this game over and over again to test my skills and for this game, I just had over 400+ points for this first time for this game. This is just awesome. I wonder what kind of new features/updates will be in. Try this game and makes Puss proud with your skills and strategy. :D

B006M4F67A|1.0|Just bought this app and when I try to play it locks up and stops responding after I've played one or two tiles. I've started it 3 times and it does it every time.  Looks like it would be fun if it worked.  I normally email the company instead of giving a bad review right away, but at the Amazon app store I don't get that option.  And there is no refund offered.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|I really had no interest in seeing this movie but my boyfriend finally talked me into and I'm glad he did! I have never laughed so hard at a movie where I had to pause it!!! Funniest movie ever!!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I never got into watching The Good Wife even after the critical acclaim, but once I started watching on Amazon Prime I have been hooked and cant get enough. The stories are all interesting and not overly dramatic and sappy. I cant wait to see what happens next even though I'm watching the latest season on DVR at the same time!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Well made, great acting,great plot. Kept me on the edge of my seat!  Can't wait to start watching season two. Once you start you can't stop watching.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|There can't be enough good things said about this movie. Action? Check. Comedy? Check. Hot guys? Check. Hot girls? Check. This is a movie that everyone can enjoy (ok, maybe not the kids).
0802473156|5.0|This book gives a person a great understanding of other peoples personalities in relation to the human mind and relationships especially of the opposite sex.  I recommend this book to anyone with marital problems or is trying to make a relationship work.  It also include true stats about when it is too late for a relationship to work.  Great book and an easy read.
0375413405|5.0|This is a must for your collection.  Filled with great &#34;tips&#34; and techniques for classic culinary skills ... even if you don't try the recipes; a wealth of knowledge.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Wow very challenging and different game.  I LOVE it!  Wish there were more of these kind of games on Amazon
B004GJYRA0|5.0|I don't just mean feel good and set a tree on fire. This movie inspires us to find the part of ourself where our color is. My favorite parts are when Jenny and David find their color. It shows how people fear change and how they react against it, sometimes using violence. A great movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I could not put it down.  I will be starting on the Shift Omnibus this evening.  Thank you for such a great book Hugh Howey.
0553280325|5.0|May be Bradbury's best.  A beautifully written parable about good and evil, youth and age.  The symbolism can be heavy-handed, but that's easily forgivable.
B002B79BVO|5.0|The best drama on television. Matthew Weiner has so perfectly re-created a lost era of American culture that it almost feels alive and contemporary.
0385349947|4.0|it's been awhile since  I got excited about a book or  speaker or movement that  addressed women's issues, so I was  vulnerable when I heard about this book and the resulting groundswell of  feminist rebirth.  The book is an easy read, not exactly a feminist manifesto, but I found it  sincere, altruistic, and a  downright good start.<br />I did have a disconnect when it came to  relating to  Ms. Sandberg's experiences.  She  exists in that rarified air- blue ribbon education, lots of  connections due to that education, and being able  jumping right into executive level  cutting edge industry had me marveling how different her experience is from my own, and I trust from the bulk of her target audience.  I don't know anyone who could march into their CEO's office and demand  a parking space for pregnant employees...I admire her chutzpah but in my  world, that ain't gonna happen.  Ditto with the  life/work balance, finding/molding a supportive life partner, etc.<br />Ms. Sandberg gets high marks from me for articulating what women feel and experience.  This book is a good start for women  starting to  navigate the business world and for those who are spinning their wheels.  I felt energized and  hopeful after reading, I think others will as well.
B0000029AP|5.0|I'd forgotten how good this album was/is. This one is worth owing for sure. I almost didn't buy it but very happy I did!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|This  was a wonderful family movie and a good story as usual from a Sparks novel that all can enjoy.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This game is addicting!  A fun escape from reality. Love playing this game.  Can not wait for more updated editions.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|First time playing it.......and may I say, so far so good. I got to find out how to use everything on the game.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|One of my main criteria for judging a book is how well it holds my interest. This gripped it. Never could tell where it was going, and it was a good ride. Crouch painted great mental pictures for me with his writing and I am already planning on seeing which of his creations will be my next read. This one was a refreshing departure form a regimented genre.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Took a flyer on it because it was 99 cents.  Was very pleasantly surprised.  Plenty of action and suspense.  May have been able to use a few less curse words, but that's my only real complaint.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|The best part of this film is how Spielberg has portrayed Lincoln's wife, Mary Todd. Rather than the usual crazy woman, she is portrayed as a woman who is grief stricken by the loss of a son and a woman who tries to help her husband maintain perspective during the Civil War. Worth renting at least once.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Not sure I liked the ending.  Have to think about that more.  Overall, the book was good.  It kept me wanting more....which is why I think I'm a little disappointed with the ending!
B001DM1VXE|3.0|If you like dark conspiracy films, then you'll like Pi. Filmed in black & white. Not intended for kids or teens.
0765325950|4.0|Loved the way it was finally wrapped up. Nice work Brandon. There were a few silly, sloppy ends,  but what can you do? It was already a million pages long. Glad for an ending.
B00932A4XE|3.0|This film is about couples who are expecting a baby and how they all interact with each other. The plot is a good one but the director uses too many stereotypes of men and women's behavior that just are not appropriate in the 21st century.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Silver Linings Playbook is hands down the best movie I've seen this year. This is one of those rare movies where the writing, cast and story mix perfectly.  I found myself laughing and sitting on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. Nice to see a film that evokes so much raw emotion. Truly a classic.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|The actors do a good job but this film is mostly about killing. Too much unnecessary violence. I cannot imagine that most law enforcement professionals will see this film as realistic or positive to their profession
B007R6UWN0|3.0|Like many tv productions today the story line gets very murky or blurred by personal events in the protagonist's life. Why am I interested in this character? I want him to solve the mystery not his family life. And as always he is a divorced parent trying to deal with a child from his previous marriage. How many times must we endure this same scenario. Doesn't anyone out there have a different idea about the mystery genre?
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|Gillian Flynn writes in a similar vein to Val McDermid. Lots of shock value. This is a dark and disturbing novel about Libby Day who was seven years old when her mother and two sisters were brutally murdered in their rural Kansas farmhouse. Libby's 15 year old brother Ben was convicted of the crimes largely on Libby's testimony. Now 20 plus years later Libby wants answers to questions as to why he did this horrendous crime.<br />The storyline appealed to me and it is well written in a blunt, graphic kind of way. Not worth 5 stars though.
B003U53GK8|5.0|Watched all seasons in a row, final season felt rushed at times & not as congruent as others but still extremely enjoyable.  Really, if you were glued through the previous seasons then the final season is a must! One of the best shows available & worth your time.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Basically a spaghetti western updated with Tarantino's sense of humor and situation.  It's not a very good western and it doesn't feel like a western even with all the horses and six guns.  Still, it's entertaining.  More than a western, this is a blaxploitation movie and has elements of Tarantino's Roadhouse movie; it's closest cousin.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is one of those albums where the entire album is good. I could listen to the entire thing  for hours. Want to get the vinyl for my collection
B00COHAUD4|2.0|Promises to be a good horror movie then drops the ball.  The ending kills the whole movie.  Ghosts movies work best when you don't ever see the ghost or the ghost is actually something else; this movie is just about a ghost so the suspense dies in the middle.
B003Y059EK|4.0|it was good. I remember watching this movie when i was a young teenager. A nice sequal to the original.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I was disappointed that there wasn't more from our two favorite vampires. The ending wasn't bad as we all knew there WAS something between Sookie and Sam.
B004478AS4|3.0|This is not a happy story, but a powerful exposition of the collision between European civilization and African tribal culture. The inevitable, inexorable denouement is crushing,leaving the reader with no hope of salvation either from native vigor or Christian gospel.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was a little disappointed by this Charlaine Harris (and I am a HUGE fan) that I had to give it two stars.  Maybe I'll read it again . . . or maybe not. Disappointing, what more can I say.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|My little girl really likes this and there are times when I will play it.  I don't like the challenge feature on it, but otherwise it is pretty much just like playing it in person.
B0035JNRYY|5.0|This is such a powerful movie. Robert Redford is really great just as he was in The Way We Were. Demi Moore did a<br />wonderful job in  Indecent Proposal, also. I would watch it over and over again.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|Once my son got the hang of it, he play this game a lot. Gets excited when the whale comes to eat the penguins.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is better than survival craft and this is an awsome game but still making more updates but still buy it it got the creepers skullies and spider plus zombies.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am a solitaire fan. I could sit and play this game for hours. I find it very relaxing. Haven't really change back grounds or anything yet.
B0007TKNIS|4.0|It's a comedy and a pretty neat adaptation of the play.  If you are open of course. It came gift rapped and arrived exactly when promided Thanks!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Thought my kids would really enjoy this but they don't seem to know what to do. Also have to have an internet connection to even be able to play.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Great book, I really enjoyed reading it. I ended up borrowing the rest of the series from the public library.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|It just keeps getting better!  The best show on television right now.  Articulate, smart, funny, and realistic.  Favorite show today!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a great game. My 5 year old sits and plays it for hours. I don't have to worry about what he is doing when he is playing it.
B00919V32K|5.0|Why did I stop listening to Zappa in the early 80's?  Because the band that he had assembled after the demise of the Underwood/Brock/Thompson/Fowler based bands of the 70's just didn't match up to the level of genius, in my own small opinion.  Joe's Garage?  Did you hear that fart sound?  Well, that was me giving my review of the domages.  For some reason, chemistry?, changing times?, mistakes?, the band that did most of the music in the early 80's just did not work , once again in my own opinion.  Consequently, I stopped listening to Zappa.  Then, Zappa changed his band once again and had actually achieved a goal with this new band that he had sought for decades.  Yes, decades.  The late 80's band actually was the Greatest Band That I Never Heard in my life.  His goal, often completely unrecognized, was the performance of LIVE MUSIC WITHOUT THE USE OF OVERDUBS.  Secretly, Zappa hated overdubs.  He wanted you to hear it there, while you were there.  He did not want to take it back to the Studios Of Muffin to add later toots and thumps and plucks.  If it needed more music , then he considered it almost a failure.  BUT, with this album, The Best Band You Never Heard In Your Life, Frank achieved one of his dreams(I think), that is to play music, live music with the entire sound created there.  Folks, he did it.  This album is tight with tallent, teamwork and intent.  It rocks, it jazzes, and it classics, just like Frank.  Supposedly &#34;Make a Jazz Noise Here&#34; and One Other 90's Album were all assembled from shows made with this accomplished band.  This is a great album.  4 out of 4 stars.  Johnny P.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I never thought the bag could look this good before purchasing it. It came as a free gift with the purchase of a Canon T3i and wow, it looks much much better than the much more expensive Canon bag. The color is black black, not the grey black I usually find on other products. And the orange accent of the Amazon logo makes the whole thing looks really good. 5 stars it is.
630542828X|5.0|How can a film about the bits and peices of a lawsuit be interesting?  It's interesting because these ice-blooded lawyers end up really caring AND coming through for the people they represent: The Forgotten Folk of the Countryside.  Its a true story.  Travolta wheres the skin of his character, living, breathing, and winning in the end.  Don't drink the water, BUT watch A Civil Action.  Johnny P.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Twin Peaks was a great series with very good actors.  My daughter and I enjoy watching it together whenever we can.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|And it's a great review of American history through the prism of presidents as they were in office and after.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I just downloaded this game today.  It seems like an interesting game.  If, as they claim, it is never-ending then I will be playing for a long time!
B00821OX98|4.0|Falling Skies is what SciFi once was: a study of the human condition. Set in a post apocalyptic earth after an alien invasion, the survivors must battle their invaders and sometimes each other. While the overall arc of the show is the struggle to survive, its episodes focus on the individuals and how they cope. I really enjoy the characters, and while it does it's best with the FX it's not the greatest, but forgivable and at times not bad. The budget for a cable show it small so I give it a lot of slack, but it really doesn't need it.<br /><br />Bottom line, it's a good show, with lots of character driven stories. More than worth the watch.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|This is about Salvador Dali and I found it to be very interesting to learn more about his life and how he got started.  Was a good movie.  Would recommend
B001BANK32|5.0|I haven't read &#34;The Shining&#34; in many years.  I wanted to revisit it, especially with the sequel coming out this fall.  This is Stephen King in top form.  It's a great read.  He builds the tension slowly and it's a fun ride.  There's nothing scary but it will give you the creeps, as well as a few tears and some laughs.  It's a little bit of everything.  Forget what you saw in the movie.  Kubrick made his version of the story, take the time to read the story as it was originally meant to be.  What's great about this book is that unlike the film you get to know the characters more and find out what makes them tick.  In addition, you get to see what each person is thinking and it makes more sense as to why each character does what he or she does.  Yes, Jack Nicholson was great at going insane.  But getting into Jack Torrance's head and seeing how and why he slides into madness is much more interesting.  Again, not scary but just creepy and a great read.  A few dated parts, but otherwise a fun ride.  Enjoy it.
B008VBYN80|4.0|grt game, but costs a fortune to get the goodies. crystals are too expensive, and cannot earn enough thru quests to buy what you need
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game and the cards are easy to see. The only down comment is that the icons on the bottom bar need to be a little bigger.
B00005JPD0|5.0|This is a great movie.  I would recommend this move to everyone.  This item came new and was in perfect condition.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It is a good book.  I'm still reading it.  I put it down because I had too many zombie nightmares!
B008NQYWC0|5.0|Another excellent book by Stephen King.  Was impressed with some of the accurate historical details in the book. Especially interesting for those who lived through that era.
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|I really enjoy this silly game simple and easy to understand. I just find it simple and fun! I need three more words!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|Good action film, typical Cruise. Plot moves a little slow...No surprises here but well worth watching for the chase scenes and action.
B005LAII1C|5.0|As soon as I saw it in the theater I knew I was going to buy it.  Awesome movie. Just keep in mind that it is &#34;unrated&#34;

B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I love this game when I've forgotten to bring a book to the dr's office! Leap.. jump.. collect. Watch out for the obstacles. We've seen this game repeated over and over again with a different character up front. It's amusing and fills empty time slots.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Quick read with an OK storyline. The story did keep me interested and had an interesting twist at the end.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My daughter enjoys hacking away at rocks and making her own caves.

B00BEPVAV8|3.0|With my tablet, I had a really hard time controlling the buggy. I constantly crashed into things and got very little done. Having said that, I didn't bother giving it much of a chance because of the overly sensitive steering with my device, but if I DID have better control, I'd probably MEAN the 3 I gave it.
1455523550|5.0|Katie arrives in a small North Carolina town, where everyone knows everybody else. It is immediately felt that she doesn't belong, the whole town is intrigued...what has brought a beautiful young woman to Southport? Katie rents a house by the ocean which is one of two cottages in need of some TLC. On one of her trips into town for groceries and supplies she is befriended by Kristen, the young daughter of shop owner Alex. We learn that Alex is widowed stayed in Southport to run his wife's family business and keep his children in the home they lived in with their mom.<br /><br />Kate arrived in North Carolina with a secret she is reluctant to share,  and is worried her past will catch up with her. As the story progresses we find out why.<br /><br />When Jo moves in next door to Katie, she drops hints that Alex is interested and suggests Katie should go out with him. Unwilling at first, Katie begins to spend more time with Alex and his children but is worried how her secret will affect their relationship if Alex finds out.<br /><br />As the story progresses we find out what Katie's dark secret is through a series of flashbacks and the point of view of her husband Kevin, also that Katie is actually Erin.<br /><br />When Kevin eventually catches up with Katie, her vision of a perfect future with Alex and his children is jeopardized.<br /><br />This was yet another Nicholas Sparks novel that I could not put down. Finding out Jo's true identity at the end was a huge shocker for me, and made me so glad that I read the book first. The ending had me in tears as has been the case with Dear John, The Last Song and The Lucky One (the other Sparks books I enjoyed). I was left contemplating the events of Safe Haven for a while after reading, to me this is always a true sign of a great book and writer - if you are left with questions, thoughts and perspectives after the fact.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|When we're talking about this game, anything is better! I downloaded it for my daughter. I failed to see any warning sign that this would be a depressive game that requires you to torture the animal to get responses. I found it cruel and hateful. I wasn't amused in any way with the reaction from the cat nor the misleading intentions of the game. I thought we'd be petting the kitty and he'd beg for more. Apparently you beat the cat to get reactions. It sucks and has no value as a game. Worthless and vile. Apparently the developer has issues and we all know what starts with animal abuse usually ends in a story line fit for CSI.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|GREAT MOVIE AND I WOULD TELL ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT IT. WOULD WATCH AGAIN. THE ACTION WAS GREAT AND EXCITING.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Considering the cast and writers, this should have been non-stop hilarious. But pretty much all the best material comes from the supporting characters, and the main characters are just nearly impossible to like/relate to. And I am totally the target audience for this kind of thing, since I'm pushing 40 myself.
0312330529|4.0|The story is irresistible: an escaped convict from Australia finds redemption in India.  The broad story line is familiar to readers of Dominique Lapierre's \\"City of Joy\\" and similar stories that juxtaposes a rather imperfect western characters with the Indian tapestry to create a deep, vibrant and multi-hued portrait.  Invariably, the rhythms of India work their magic on the westerner.<br /><br />Much of this is there in \\"Shantaram\\", a story told in the first person by Gregory David Roberts in an autobiographical manner.  The zeitgeist of the novel is freedom.  Freedom to be true to yourself, freedom to love, freedom to pursue liberty, and freedom from being pursued by the long arm of the law.  The first half of the story is simply enchanting as the reader is immersed in Mr. Roberts' world of escaping the Australian prison and getting seemingly lost in the teeming masses of India.  Mr. Roberts learns the ubiquitous and idiosyncratic Indian head wiggle and is proud to have mastered it.  He learns some Hindi and Marathi, the latter being the language of Mumbai, which he calls home.  The ancillary characters created by Mr. Roberts that help him get acclimated to India are very well sketched out.  Prabhaker, his guide that becomes a dear friend; Johnny Cigar, a name formed by joining words from two unrelated street posters; Karla, Mr. Roberts' muse; Didier, a french expat lounging in India; Abdel Khader Khan, the intellectual but deadly mafia don; Abdullah, an Iranian expat running from the Iran-Iraq war (this is the 1980's) who becomes a blood brother to Mr. Roberts, and many more.<br /><br />Armed with a comprehensive first-aid kit and pedantic knowledge gained from a class in Australia that taught him the basics of nursing, Mr. Roberts becomes a veritable doctor to the folks of the \\"zhopadpatti\\" (the slum) where he settles.  Away from the arm of the law, he finds refuge and dignity by treating simple folks of rat bites, dysentery, diarrhea and similar ailments.  Butof course, these are not enough to make ends meet, so he arranges the rendezvous of westerners and locals so the former parts with money and the latter parts with quality marijuana.  Mr. Roberts gets a small cut from the transaction.  His wheeling-dealing and foolhardy bravery (there isn't a fight that Mr. Roberts runs away from) gets him noticed by the local mafia don and soon Mr. Roberts moves to the big leagues.  He loves, looses his love, makes friends, looses friends, participates in the Afghan war (Afghanistan and Russia are embraced in a deadly embrace) to search for the meaning of life, gets imprisoned in the infamous Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, and ultimately realizes that freedom is elusive.<br /><br />The novel is huge --- more than 900 pages.  The first half is simply enthralling.  The second half starts feeling a bit lugubrious and meanders on repeating the same platitudes of lost love and freedom that the author talked about earlier.  Fortunately, all this changes when Mr. Roberts describes his time in Arthur Road prison; that part redeems the second half.  The story takes on a tragic turn after he is released from prison.  As if to atone for his myriad losses, Mr. Roberts follows don Khan to Afghanistan, who ironically becomes completely ineffectual in his home environment.  Mr. Roberts returns to India a changed man, having learned that freedom is elusive.  One is free to pursue his destiny, but the freedom to do so shackle other aspects of one's life in ways that can be neither forseen nor foretold.<br /><br />Despite the uneven pacing in the second half, I think this book is simply marvellous.  The tale is captivating, the characters are excellent and the story telling aptitude of Mr. Roberts, for the most part, is great. (April 2013).
B00914JWSW|3.0|I love Babs, but for some reason this CD did not click for me.  There was an emotional inbalance with her voice and the style of the instrumentation.  Only my opinion.  It pained me to only give this three stars, was hoping for more.

B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|The Wachowskis do it again!  Just as The Matrix blew our minds so many years ago on the nature of reality, this film for me brings into question the idea of identity and responsibility.<br /><br />I found it a daring and profound idea that people's lives and destinies would be bound in the karma of love and action, over and over again.  I also found the film to offer a deep, and profound criticism of our consumerist culture- and the consequences of it.<br /><br />I love this film, and cannot recommend it more highly.  However, you should watch it HOPING to have a transcendental experience.  If you're looking for an action flick or to be drawn into the film against your will... it will be like looking at someone else's old family photos.  You'll be disappointed.  If you go looking for transformation, you will find it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It's very functional, fast, and very fun.<br />I don't have problems with nothing, this app runs very well. I recommend it
B000FA675C|5.0|A fun twisting tale that engages the mind. Riddles and secrets that turn and double back. Of course the movie has nothing on the book.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book in just a few days. I just couldn't put it down. Exciting, suspenseful and surprisingly deep at time, I can totally see why this is on the Marine Corps recommended reading list. It shows an interesting angle to the burdens of command and the purpose of hard and repetitive training starting with the basics always.<br />Not to mention, being a huge sci-fi fan, you gen see where a lot of popular sci-fi writers found their inspiration. Many ideas and character types and story points can be seen in a lot of today's games, movies, shows, and comics.  Definitely going to read the rest in this series. YOU HAVE GOT TO READ THIS.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Loved the book, and this is well done. Don't like that it'll be three movies, but it's very well done.

The cast of stars somehow managed to give just enough to allow everyone to shine...The action was  almost non-stop and in between the interaction of the characters was hilarious. Robert Downey Jr. stole the show without stealing the spotlight and I couldn't be happier about it...Awesome movie and I can't wait for the sequel...
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|its a pretty good movie, if you have not read the book. But if you have, prepare to be disappointed. They left out way too much key information that really made the story. it just doesn't compare.
1400069742|3.0|One of the principal villains in this book is Charles Lindbergh. From the book we learn that Lindbergh was a lousy husband, an indifferent father,politcally naive and not even a particularly good pilot. I will not comment further on the author's assertions about Lindbergh's private life, but the facts surrounding his epic flight from New York to Paris are a matter of record.<br />The author dismisses it early in the book, claiming that it was a mere \\" stunt \\". This is hardly borne out by the facts.<br />Well aware of the risk he was taking, Lindbergh methodically planned his flight every day for months. The Spirit of St. Louis was purpose built expressly for this flight at a cost of $ 10,000, a large sum of money in 1927. The airplane was \\" stripped down\\" only in the sense that it did not contain a single component or piece of equipment that was not absolutely necessary to accomplish it's proposed flight.Lindbergh wrote a memorable account of the flight in 1953. Titled \\" The Spirit of St. Louis \\", it won a Pulitzer Prize the following year and explains in detail his reasoning for decisions not to include a parachute or a radio, among other things. Also, Lindbergh didn't\\" navigate by the stars, something he wasn't very familiar with .\\" He used dead reckoning, and did it so well that his landfall on the Irish coast was within a mile or two of his intended goal. A modern pilot using a GPS couldn't have done much better.<br />For a number of years, Charles Lindbergh engaged regularly in some of the most high risk flying ever undertaken and walked away without a scratch. This isn't the resume of a stunt flyer. His place in the history of aviation is secure, and will continue to be recognized long after this book has gone out of print.<br />Regarding Franklin Roosevelt, it would appear from this book that he was a knave - a second or third rate political operative who, without widespread political support, dithered, waffled, and pursued private vendettas  while his nationdrifted inexorably toward war.This is certainly not consistent with other accounts of his presidency I've read.<br />I had high expectations for this book. Ms. Olson is the co - author of \\"A Question of Honor\\", a marvelous book that remains one of my favorites on the subject of the Second World War.This book just isn't in the same class, in my opinion.
B00340LM8C|5.0|Suspense, woman fighting over carey grant, crime. what more could  a girl ask for from a movie? Keep in mind its an older film but still a great one.
B003VANOFY|3.0|The surround sound is very suspect in this pair of headphones.  I owned a pair of Turtle Beach headphones that had 5.1 surround sound that actually worked.  The software is fair as well.  For the price, not a bad pair of headphones, just not great.  If I knew what I know now, I probably would have bought a different pair of headphones and returned these.  The bass is lacking in depth.  The ability to use a mixer is not very good to adjust the sound.  If you want surround sound, don't get these.

0812993845|5.0|This review was written by my daughter.<br /><br />Wedding Night by Sophie Kinsella fit in perfectly with the rest of Kinsella's books having just the right amount of humor, character development and twists and turns to keep you engaged thru the whole story.<br /><br />It is the story of 2 sisters, Lottie and Fliss. Lottie has had a lot of breakups that have caused her to make several \\"unfortunate choices\\"(as her sister Fliss would put it); however, she thought she FINALLY found the perfect man and was convinced he would be proposing to her while at a fancy lunch in London.  As it turned out, instead of proposing, he told her that he was leaving to work in California! Lottie was both furious and devastated over the situation and was determined to make some changes in her life. And that she did!  Particularly when she ran into her ex-love, Ben, who in one drunken night convinced her that they were destined to be together and should be married immediately!  To make sure their decision to be married was being made for the \\"right reasons\\" they agreed to wait for their wedding night to consummate the marriage. They luckily were able to book a last minute lavish honeymoon in Greece, where they originally met, and couldn't be more excited to \\"seal the deal\\" on their Wedding Night!<br /><br />Fliss is Lottie's older sister who has always felt she had to care for and protect Lottie since their mother wasn't there for them.  She is always the one to bail Lottie out of situations that arise from her \\"unfortunate choices\\" so she is particularly concerned when she hears of Lottie's break up!  Fliss is currently going through a very painful divorce that is taking a huge toll on her and making it difficult to juggle her son, high power career and watching out for Lottie...but she always seems to come up with a solution and maintain her composure.  That is until she hears of Lottie's newest choice to get married to a man she barely knows and hasn't seen in 15 years!!  Fliss panics upon hearing this news and feels she needs to drop everything to save Lottie from making a huge mistake!  When she hears from her divorce lawyer that a marriage can be annulled as long as it is not \\"consummated\\", she immediately devises an elaborate plan to sabotage Lottie's honeymoon, particularly her Wedding Night!  Luckily being the editor of a well-known travel magazine, she has connections everywhere that can help her pull off the plan.<br /><br />As you can imagine, there are a lot of hilarious twists and turns as Fliss tries to save Lottie from herself, and eventually she realizes that she needs a little saving of her own.  As in all of Kinsella's books, each chapter is written from a different character's point of view, mainly Lottie's and Fliss's, which allows you to truly relate to each character and see the story from all different angles.<br /><br />I found this book to be an enjoyable addition to Sophie Kinsella's collection and would highly recommend it to her fans or anyone.upon hearing this news and feels she needs to drop everything to save Lottie from making a huge mistake!

B007EDYN36|4.0|Admittedly, Peter Criss is not great at writing but this tome really delves deep into his relationship with KISS the band. Some great stories about each member and some not so surprising revelations about all of them too. Actually, as a KISS fan since the mid 70's,  this book pretty much solidifies my personal feelings about the different members of the band and why they have lost their way in my and many other life-long fans opinions. When greed is your main focus as opposed to the art of music and entertainment, I lose interest quickly. Criss shows over and over again what motivates Simmons and Stanley in KISS and it isn't rock n roll or the fans. It's $$$$$$ and nothing else. Don't let them fool you with the BS they spew all the time. They will step on anyone and everyone to make a buck. If they could make more money making crappy TV dinners or selling used cars or furniture instead of music, there is no doubt that they would in a heart beat. The incredible callousness that Simmons and Stanley treat their &#34;band mates&#34; is horrible. Very sad really. But overall the book tells a clear picture of what it took to be in the most popular band of the 70's and how to survive it. Even as self-deprecating as Criss is in the book, he does leave out some details and can come off as slightly delusional but far less delusional than Simmons, Stanley and even Frehley. KISS fans should certainly check it out.
B003FBMS4W|5.0|Growing up in the 1970s, for me John Wayne was more of an icon than a real star.  Then I started watching these pictures from his prime.  The Searchers stands out because he seems to little resemble the classic save-the-day cowboy hero.  I was surprised at how flat out angry he plays--he's ruthless and nasty and obsessed.  Others, due to the era in which the film was made, notice the ambiguity surrounding the racial/genocidal themes.  For me, though, the Duke's performance dominates this film and fills the vast emptiness of the West.
B00785P2QC|5.0|great game and great graphics and also great background and great buildings<br />also great land scapes very great game once again you get to put building where ever you want
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is one of the most touching and very real books I've ever read!!! The author is brilliant in her very visual descriptions of things and experiences! I love how she tapped into the senses to help capture a feeling.  This book left me feeling very happy and hopeful in the good of people.

B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this app. But it is like putting a stained glass image together with missing pieces. There are multiple textures (glass, metal, wood, etc.) and they all start with fairly easy puzzles and progress to much harder. none of them are impossible but at the end of each texture level, there is a times section that wins you one to three stars. Actually the 'easier' timed sections are the hardest. You have a really short amount of time to get through 6 puzzles where as the harder levels you have a much longer amount of time to get through 6 levels. I usually get three stars on the harder ones and have trouble on the easier ones!<br /><br />The graphics are great and change screen animations are fun to watch.<br /><br />But this is addictive, fun and you can go back and redo the puzzles. They seem to get mixed up a little differently each time.<br /><br />Definitely worth the two bucks.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Finally a show that was funny and not filthy.  I enjoyed it very much and hope to find more like it.
B00BF123WG|3.0|It was ok.  I think the Oscar nomination had more to do with the content than the execution.  I would have rather read an article or seen a news sort of story.  Found some of it hard to follow.  The final scenes representing the seal team 6 mission was well done.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|A solid series that ends on a cliffhanger; one can only hope there will be another season.  Beautiful scenery, good acting, and an interesting script all make this a worthwhile drama to watch.
B00124BNF4|3.0|I bought this hoping that I had forgotten about some songs that I didn't have on Fear of Music or Speaking in Tongues.  So far, I only responded to 1 song, but I suppose that could change.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Great bad guys and believable characters make this a great series. I always waited eagerly for the next shows to come out and enjoy it even more now that I can watch them concurrently at my leisure.
B006M4F67A|2.0|I would have given it 5 stars if there had been any explanation to their icons. There was a little circle with an arrow that I thought might be to go back a move, but instead gave me another game or the same game all over again. These may be some kind of standard icons to the savvy, but I don't know most of them and I thought I was fairly knowledgeable. I only found out by accident that flowers and seasons tiles could be mixed. These apps need to have some help files. This is far from the only app with this problem.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love it! We love Disney and all th  Disney app games. They are always great quality. I have shared it with all my family so they can enjoy it too.

159562015X|5.0|It's an easy assessment for anyone to complete. The results provided will lead the conversation in a positive manner. Who doesn't want to hear the value they bring to the team? The material inspires the person in a positive way.  It can be used to encourage them to always performance at their best.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|This movie is simply outstanding.  I felt as though I were there, living it during Lincoln's time.  It's something I think everyone should see.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeffrey Archer writes the best family oriented suspensful novels. This is part of a saga that has now covered three books. They all end with a cliffhanger. Makes for good reading.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It's pretty graphic, but it's a good, well-written book.  Definite summertime reading.  I like Hoover's books, and this one is different in many ways.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|My kids were astonished I'd never watched this show on cable--watch it on Amazon then said they. I'm still in Season 1 and hooked. Many violent episodes left exploring the eternal American paradox: &#34;good guys&#34; have to do evil and disobey the law they should respect.  Why? To &#34;protect &#34; the public from bad guys. Simple dramatic ploy, but the writing and acting is (so far) top notch.
B009R659L8|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot.  I always like Mary Higgins Clark's book, and this is one of the best.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A different sort of story which sheds some light on people with aspergers syndrome. Lots of laughs but also some tender moments.
1609611543|4.0|I now have eliminated wheat from my diet because of this book.  I eat a diet high in fat with moderate protein and low carbohydrate.  I can't say I've lost much weight..if any by doing this for about a month now.<br />On the plus side however, my skin has never ever looked this good.  I'm a 23 year old female and have been battling acne since I was 13.  I have tried pills and creams and face washes and toners.  Nothing really worked.<br />I even took birth control just to control my break outs.  I went off of birth control about a month ago and the last time i did that my skin broke out to the point where I wanted to hide in a hole.  This time, not a single break out has occurred.  I am going to give the credit to eliminating wheat.<br />I also had a weird dry patch between by nose and eye on one side, it's now gone.  I had a weird dry patch on my ride side of my stomach, it's also gone.  I had those dry patches for months and months and no cream would make them go away until wheat was eliminated.<br />I used to get weird stomach aches, a burning sensation really, that's now gone.<br />I wish it would have resulted in more weight loss but I think I need to count calories even though the author says that isn't necessary.  It is for me.<br />This book has really changed the way I think about bread and other carbs, even beans, brown rice and sweet potatoes to name a few.  I used to crave bread.  I think I even dreamed about bread.  I had bread at every meal.  I went cold turkey and I couldn't be an happier.  I've been experimenting with gluten free recipes for muffins and breads...even cupcakes.  You can make great tasting gluten free healthy low carb baked goods...i swear it's possible!!  Give this book a shot.  I don't believe everything in it but if I can avoid terrible diseases by eliminating gluten and wheat, why not give it a shot?  Bread isn't doing anyone any good anyway, so just get rid of it!
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|I have a Razer Naga but wanted something with fewer buttons that was more ergnomic. This was a nice mouse for the $$$ but the button layout was not good for use. 1. The scroll wheel location is much farther back than the Naga. With the Naga I simply swing my index finger over and it is right on it. With the Ankor I have to hook my finger over and back to reach it, having to modify my grip on the mouse to do this. It was a slow movment that eliminated all my fine motor control of the mouse while playing a FPS like Planetside Two. This also lead to the second problem, when I changed my grip to reach the MMB I would frequently hit the back most thumb button, thus throwing a grenade resulting in mass team killing...lol. I used it for awhile button could not find a grip that fixed the two problems so I returned it. Other than that the mouse seemed fine.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is my new favorite.  I love the colors and the sounds of the reef.  It is peaceful and exciting as you patiently watch the coral reef grow into a vibrant and thriving animal habitat.  The interaction with the wildlife and the reef are rewarding and lovely to watch.  Recommend highly.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I particularly liked the bonus features at the close of the film. I makes me proud to be an American.
B00BJ7G1VK|5.0|I saw the program on you tube and fell in love with the 'Little Paris Kitchen'.  I adore that she does everything on a two burner hot plate and teeny tiny oven.  I havn't had anything that wasn't wonderful.  Shows that a true cook doesn't need all the fancy shmancy kitchen stuff, just the desire and talent.  Watch on you tube and buy the book.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|I have watched this movie three times and each time I see something new. Should be required viewing by every current Congress person.
1451695195|5.0|This book was tremendous.  I couldn't put it down.  I loved the way he wrote about his time in heaven and it was so uplifting.  I am glad that a doctor wrote this because usually doctors don't believe in the afterlife.  I've told many people about this book.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I have been a fan since the very first episode of Season 1, and it just keeps on making me laugh.  I can see the nerdy side in me coming out from time to time in every episode.
B002OF5KWM|4.0|The story I knew well as I was a part of the scene amd times.  We had some wicked insane fun then as you can see in the film.  All good times must end and in Party Monster it ended badly for far  too many.  the story is well written and remains entertaining up through the end.  It is of course the characters that make this story, they portrayed Michael as sort of a tragic hero almost.  It was a good time taken to extremes by a few sad people.  Sad part is the bad behavior of a few ruined the life of P.G. & his family & ended what was a creative, fun, welcoming, club scene where the top priority was to have fun.  Sadly it was the beginning of the end of nightlife for me.  It's a solid choice to watch & own as it's easy to watch more than once.  Fabulous movie darlings!!!  LOL
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Lots of potential.....never actually got there.  The actors are all great, the only thing that saves this from 1 star.
159562015X|5.0|I recommend this and test for any business or relationship. Become aware of who you are and how you work so that you get the most out of your business and your relationships.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Wonderful Series worth watching.  We love the series and didn't get turned on to it until the third season was over.  Now we can see the third season uninterrupted.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I found the characters to all be so endearing. The story line is full of twists and turns. A must see!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A real page turner--can't put it down.  Reminds me of some of Grisham's earlier works.  Highly recommended, but don't start it until you have time to finish it.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Enjoyed the film but kept comparing physical characteristics of Reacher to actuality of Tom Cruise.  If I hadn't read most of the series of books I would have just enjoyed it for its own sake; would like to see more, though.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|I love this movie.  it's so survivalist and entertaining.  makes you appreciate people who are truly self sufficient and makes me want to become moreso myself.  wahlberg is a badass here.
B001QB9ETK|5.0|The acting was superb. The story was moving.I have seen it many times in the past but it is a movie that I can see over and over again.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Good novel. Except I skipped some pages completely because I thought they were just too stretched. Unexpected ending. Would have been better if it came to some conclusion.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|It has the problem that I say about almost every movie - it's too long. Probably by a good half hour or more. That is the only flaw in my opinion. The story is brilliant. The dialogue is brilliant as in every Tarantino movie. I always say I wish he would make a movie without the violence because it is not necessary. The dialogue is strong. Walz deserves his Oscar although his role is more lead than supporting. Decaprio is also great. Overall a very good movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It wasn't as good as the 1st two but It was good<br />I had trouble staying interested it took a long time to read!<br />That's why I gave only 4 stars<br />I
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Hi I'm doing a review thing for every app I purchase! Don't worry,I won't lecture you! THIS APP DID NOT GIVE ME ANY PROBLEMS!!! And yes,it does let you purchase cheats to pass a level they give you 3 to start with!!! I love the game play and its total fun! My 12 year old loves it and so do I! If you love fun must buy!:))))))))))))
B00594XOZU|1.0|I chose this reading because it stopped working.<br />I barely got to use it then it stopped working.<br />I like that it's a talking app. I dislike alot that I can't use it.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Movie was fairly intense for a plot that many of us know generally but overall still well made.  It did a good job pulling the parts together.  Regardless of the historical accuracy, still interesting to watch.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|The author did a great job showing how people's past and their parents shape them into who they are. All of the details that the author put in this book are amazing. The changing back and forth from human to wolf is worded beautifully. It is so creative and poetic!
B00BS4PF0C|4.0|This is a fun song, but I can't listen to it in the car with my kids.  Where is the \\"radio version\\"?<br />You can't help but sing along and I don't want them singing this version in front of Grandma!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My son loves playing it.  He has enjoyed it when he is able to play it on his kindle tablet.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This trilogy was one of the best I've read in a long time! It has suspense, romance, a hero and heroine, all in one series. This, the final book, tells of the final battle the rebels must go through to free themselves from the tyranny of the Capitol.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|This woman has a voice that sounds like a cross between Janis Joplin and Etta James with even more power and range.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So much fun. Better than tv. My daughter and I laugh till we cry at some of the pins. My husband started looking after Ishowed him a backsplash I wanted.
B008SOS63S|5.0|The quality of the live sound was excellent. The music and the artists were even better  The music from the guest artists made this double CD an excellent bargain.
0786956291|3.0|as a kid when this was cool. This game is great but so hard to understand the game play. Buy this if you know how to play or know someone who does.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I started watching THE GOOD WIFE during Season 4 and became so engrossed that we went back to Seasons 1-3 (free with PRIME on Amazon).  Unlike some series that wax-and-wane, THE GOOD WIFE is consistently good... episode-after-episode, season-by-season.<br /><br />I had avoided the program for 3 years because the premise did not interest me:  a wife who stays with her politician husband after gross infidelity.  I lived through the 1990s; I saw that.  The actual show, though, is definitely NOT a rerun of the Clinton reality.<br /><br />Perhaps I should say that the infidelity is addressed in the first couple of minutes in the pilot episode.  Then, we're off-and-running on the core story of a mother (and wife) who returns to the workplace (lawyer) and climbs through resolve and integrity (um... usually) to a secure place in the world.  At the same time, it is the story of law-in-action and of Chicago-land politics.<br /><br />Take a chance and jump into THE GOOD WIFE.
B003THHIEM|5.0|when comes to the crap we watch  now, at least this has comedy, drama, and ends with a good feeling
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This season was awesome! So suspenseful and I couldn't stop watching. Just ordered the third season, I can't wait to see what happens:)
0061992860|5.0|Good guide to have in your bug out bag. Has some helpful info in it. Always good to refresh the memory.
B008220D7S|5.0|When I saw this movie I could relate to it in so many ways.  Even though I still have half a decade to go before I'm 40, being a mother and wife, I can relate to everything that goes on in this movie.  Funny!
B007TK77QE|2.0|Could not get into this. Very confusing at the beginning, middle and then it becomes abit clearer at the end, if you make it that far.
0385349947|5.0|This book was very inspirational.  You feel empowered almost immediately after reading the first few sentences.  Sheryl Sandberg is a leading modern feminist.  BTW, feminist in her book is not a bad word.  It's not what people have made it to be, it means empowering and belief in equality.  Belief in yourself as a woman and an individual.  Great and easy read!
B00867GHS8|4.0|My three year old son loves this movie and looks great on Blu-ray.  A great buy and a classic to watch over and over and over again.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I had heard so many good things about this show and had to join the bandwagon.  I'm so glad I did, one of the<br />best series I've seen, next to Dexter.  I just completed the second season and ordered the third.  You won't be disappointed!
B000002J1M|5.0|Classic Genesis at their best. There are no bands around now that can hold a candle to these guys. Once Gabriel and Hackett left, they were not anywhere near as good. The period between 1970 and 1977 was my favorite Genesis years.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Very Cool movie, my family loved it. The director stuck close to the book. Can't wait for the second part.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I wanted to be able to enjoy the music of Les Miserable without having to watch the film.  I decided to buy the deluxe edition because some of the songs I enjoyed were not on the single disc edition and it allows you to follow the story better without the visuals of the film.  You don't loose the epic feel with the deluxe edition.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|How many amazing talents are out there that never get mass recognition?  How important is it really?  What if you got that recognition and you never knew?  What if others profited on it and you never profited?  Rodriquez shows us how he lived with grace and purpose and eventually fame and recognition.  Pretty amazing story, you must watch!
B00821OX98|5.0|This series is very captivating!  Can't wait to watch Season 2!  If you are into Sci-Fi you will definitely love this show.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|not bad - enjoyed the movie.  Not what i expected but was good none the less - as i said enjoyable evening
1439153663|5.0|I could not put this book down and was sad when I had finished it.  Very descriptive and emotionally captivating.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|We used this for a video my friend needed to shoot and the sound was noticeably different and better.  The little clippy thingy is weird, but other than that, I recommend.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The story was a beautifully woven saga of a family's history.  The real-life characters were intricately intertwined. The jumping back and forth from past to present was masterfully done.
0547391005|5.0|Great collection of the Curious George adventures. The book is great and looking forward to sharing the great adventures that I read as a child with my little one. The book also has CDs of audio, what else could make this product better :).
B0074MZSWW|3.0|I saw Alabama Shakes on the Grammies, and was impressed.  I had heard the same song on the radio.  But, the CD is very repetitive.  You can only use the same vocal tricks once or twice, before you lose my interest.  She sings, she yells, she shrieks and let's her voice break over and over and over again.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is very addicting I downloaded it this morning and I haven't been able to put it down. Good thing I got it on a day I had off work lol
0385349947|5.0|You may not agree with all but it gives you something to think about.  taking my time reading it so I can digest it slowly.
B007VTUYWW|5.0|I love Lara Croft movies and this being the first is fantastic, however, was unable to watch past first few minutes due to streaming problems with the movie. Picked another movie and had no problems so I could not watch it this time.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|The movie was great. I would recommend it to all audiences. Denzel is always wonderful and he did a great job on his role
B007C94XG4|5.0|Great movie the kids love watching over and over. The parents enjoyed a time or two also..cute movie for a family
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Great special effects and based on a true story.  The family fights for survival and never gives up hope.  My favorite kind of film.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|What a boring movie!  Still have not figured out what the purpose was in making this movie, what the plot was or the message it was to have spoken.  I do not have to pay to watch someone with a mental illness act out.  They exist in every day life.  Can I get a refund?
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|This is an Excellent DVD. I do not have a Blue Ray player.<br />It was Excellent to see Anthony Hopkins to paly Sir Alfred Hitchcock!<br />The DVD was Excellent!
B002RKSZS0|5.0|I love everything about Jane Austen.  Her books are the best of English Literature, and the movie about this book really made the book come alive.
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|I realize that this is a classic but it is way too short for 10.00.  Of course I loved the story.  Who doesnt love a story about a man who takes care of a mentally retarded friend?  I wish very much that this story was longer.  I really loved all of the characters but I wanted to know more about what made them tick.  You will certainly regret that it ends the way it does but you understand that it has to be this way. Buy it, you'll like it.  Although, I'd try to find it at a better price.  Your only regret will be that you didnt get to know all of them better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|wow I love it. and the best was the second one and that I wish that they would've. made a third one but much bether
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Bought this for travel and it charges my Samsung s3 and iPhone without any problems.  I get about 2 full charges before needing to recharge power pack.  Size is perfect, about the size of a deck of cards, easy to carry in shirt pocket.  Included cables are better quality than i have experienced.  Much better than the $15.00 one you see from others.  Haven't tried the dual charging yet. Slick black case is high tech and high quality.
B009PHRIAE|5.0|These are re-releases of Brueggen's Telefunken recordings. The weakest performances on this set are Frans Brueggen's collaboration with the Concentus Musicus of Vienna on Telemann concertos. The strongest piece is a reworked Bach trio sonata for viola da gamba, recast as a haunting sonata for two flutes, again with the Concentus Musicus. The Telemann concertos are merely good. The Bach is mesmerizing.<br /><br />The bulk of this set consists of performances by three people, Brueggen, Anner Bylsma on the cello, and Gustav Leonhardt. This trio played together for decades. They were always good, from the Telemann sonatas of the early 60s to the much later French sonatas, you also get to hear a progression of playing style, instruments and recording engineering. The French Sonatas disc is one of the absolute gems of the set.<br /><br />Then there are the unaccompanied pieces by composers ranging from the early, van Eyck, to the relatively late, Telemann. These remain the definitive performances.<br /><br />For some variety, you get English consort music, and the occasional concerto. Brueggen also teams up with his students Walter van Hauve and Kees Boeke for some lovely duets and trios.<br /><br />Should you buy this set? If you love the recorder, you will buy the set. If you love the instrument, you already know all about Frans Brueggen. The recorder is one of the easier instruments to master, but it takes a sense of musicianship and keen scholarship to rise to the top and dominate the field for as long as Brueggen has. To the recorder lover, you will buy it, and you will likely know exactly what you are getting.<br /><br />What if you listen occasionally to this music, and you're not entirely sure what a recorder is? Should you buy it? If you like to explore, perhaps you should, though the set has woefully few notes to guide you. Compare this set to the 3 LP set released in the early 70s of Brueggen playing 17 different recorders, where you got a treatise on the various instruments and how they were made, lavish photographs, and extensive backgrounds on the composers. You could and did learn a lot about early music from reading the notes back then. This set offers almost nothing of that, though all the pieces of that earlier set are included here. The beginner will get no clue about how to proceed. If you buy this set, you will need to use Wikipedia to find your way around.<br /><br />So unfortunately, this is a set for folks who already know about Brueggen and the recorder, a cheap digital dump. Call it a wasted opportunity.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|A re-make and Colin is as good as Schwarzenegger but I still like the original - guess it's nostalgic and I can't help that.
193700788X|1.0|...which means that I am an idiot.  I could not bring myself to have come this far into this series, and not finish it.  This despite how painfully bad and boring the last few books have been.  I'd really hoped that Ms. Harris would not just listen to the feedback from her fans, but actually heed it. Especially since this is the last one!  But once again, we have page after page of uninteresting, insignificant and repetitive drivel.  I'm 3/4 of the way done, and it's taking me forever to complete.  It's just that boring. It's almost like Ms. Harris is ashamed of the sexier and more exciting books, and feels the need to repent or apologize for them. Some of Sookie's mutterings were so self-righteous, it was sickening. I'd also hoped I'd never hear the words \\"cluviel dor\\" again! Sorry, folks!  I noticed that there is another book in the works to let the readers know where everyone ends up.  Frankly, Ms. Harris, I don't give a damn.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|as the cliche says, a tour de force for Meryl Streep. She is a very good actor and she carries this part well. The story itself is<br />not very strong and sketchy but Meryl carries the whole movie. You'll want to see it just for her. She is a star.
0425252868|5.0|Unusual story from World War 2. Had not heard of this and after reading the account I know why. Very interesting.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I chose the Bible because I like the feeling of putting my finger on the scriptures instantly and especially during our<br />worship service and actually motivates me to read the bible more on a daily basis.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I first picked this book up at a small-town science fiction/fantasy convention in the author's home town. I hadn't heard of him before, but for the fun of it, I picked up an autographed copy.... and didn't put it down until I was finished.<br /><br />The book had a flavor just a bit different than the many other fantasy novels I've read. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and I encourage others to give it a shot.  Had my second read-through after picking up the Kindle edition, and enjoyed it just as much as the first time.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is perfect for me, now that I have a Kindle Fire!  i'm no longer tied to my PC when I want to check on my ebay items or surf the site (and I refuse to use a tiny smartphone and torture my eyes)!  I couldn't be more pleased!
193700788X|2.0|Spoilers....<br /><br />13 years of my life spent with this series and she ends up with  Sam?!?! Seriously? The book ends with Sookie somewhat independent and a bit stronger, so I appreciate that, and I get it, that maybe in the \\"real world\\" Sam was the only one capable of having a true human(ish) relationship with Sookie, but that's about it.  I mean come on!  The first book floored me.  I read it on the beach in 5 hours and burned the heck out of my back in doing so, I was completely sucked into this series after the first book.  Sookie herself is not full human, so why not end up with a a stronger supe?  I'd take Eric, Bill, Quinn, Alcide over Sam any day.  Sam is safe, he's the best friend and it almost feels incestuous to think of them together.  It just feels like she landed on a pile of feathers after an exciting, sometimes dangerous roller coaster ride, a ride that should have given her (and us) the firework ending we all thought we were going to get, the one the series built up for... an exciting and hopefully impossible outrageous ending.<br /> The greatest part of this series was that,  the supernatural aspect to it, seemed plausible.  CH made vamps, were's, shapeshifters, witches, faeries, and demons seem real in these books, so why not end up with one of her great loves. Sigh.  Maybe I was searching for HEA...holding out that Eric would accept Sookie's humanity and love her throughout her life until the end, and I do believe he had it in him...alas, the script was flipped and the lap dog wins.
0446547654|5.0|He's my favorite author and I am a sap for romantic books.  I've never met a nicholas sparks book I dont like.  But be prepared to not want to put it down and perhaps cry.  Looking forward to his new one being released in September.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|This is my favorite disney movie.  Great price and can't wait to watch it with my son!  Appropriate movie for young children.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Fun game. I love that you can chase and eat people and hear them scream. You also eat many other fish, but watch out for enemies. You can use touch or tilt controls.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is a wonderful series.  I have watched every episode that is available.  It is so well done, going between the lives of the people in Lark Rise to the town people in Candleford, and their interactions with each other in spite of their different kinds of lives.
B002QZ399G|5.0|George Clooney nails this one dead on.  The academy award he received was well earned for his tremendous and moving performance.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I like this game a lot and will continue to play.<br />The birds are so cute, and funny to watch.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Tom Cruise pushed the envelope even further in this one, with his nail biting risk taking.  Put on your seat belts for this one.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|My son and I are both big fans of Pixar Animation Films. Toy Story 1, 2 and 3 are all wonderful movies worth watching over and over.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much.  Hard to put down.  Really set home the sacrifices made by the men and women that serve this country.  Especially those damn few that call themselves Navy Seals.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I think its one of the best since eternity warriors 2<br />alot of stages for online playing its awesome i give it a thumbs up....plus five stars weapon upgrades are decent,as well as gameplay alittle slow depending on how many online players are in your party but its not like its for a game console 4pkayers is cool once it gets going its great......no more than four players or its liable to freeze up....<br /><br />'ll
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was by far the most amazing book i have ever read the end is so shocking it makes u want to cry.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I really do like this game but i think there should be some changes like exp should be easier to get, and the same with money because it take  forever to get just enough money to buy one set of armor so either it should be easier to get money or everything should be cheaper you decide.  Also i think that you shouldn't have to dismantle your armor to to make a new one i think there should be infinite slots in the game but other than that this game is incredible even better after  uou see the movie.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|i love sci-fi and BBC shows like doctor who would love to see more in the prime listing on amazon
0385349947|4.0|I bought the book after hearing Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in conversation with Google chairman Eric Schmidt at the Computer History Museum. I'd recommend this book for any career woman who wants to climb the \\"jungle gym\\", as Sandberg describes it, as opposed to a \\"corporate ladder\\".  Men should read this book to learn where they may fail women and what to do about it.<br /><br />She openly discusses her fears and luck in her successful career. She also mentions traits of other successful women. Being near Stanford University, she was able to tap some of the world's best researchers on gender inequalities.  The acknowledgement list is long and distinguished.  There are copious footnotes at the end of the book and references.  This book is most like the [[ASIN:0743222253 Living History]].<br /><br />Some of my values and experiences mirror those of Sheryl, some are quite different, in part because I went to a school and college for females only, so it's a book that lingers in your brain as you try to develop a strategic path for yourself.<br /><br />Here are some of the observations that Sheryl makes and actions she takes, backed up by research, and my thoughts:<br /> - more men than women want to be the President or have high goals - I found this surprising as at ten years old I thought I'd be on the steps of 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister in the UK<br /><br /> - women tend to be fearful in asking for promotions - I didn't have a clue that you were supposed to ask when I started work - I thought that like college and school you'd be promoted annually and that a boss's job was to make you a star - the only promotion I've had I asked for after advice from a senior manager - so the book is really valuable here in telling women how to get on in life<br /><br /> - Sheryl left a job at McKinsey after a year - I'd never have done that at her age as a core value above almost anything else for me was loyalty and I believed I could turn any situation into a good one (found out later this is not necessarily true)- - another valuable lesson<br /><br /> - people like to fit in - I've always wanted to be unique and differentiated from everyone around me - she tells a story about her son wearing a blue T-shirt on St Patrick's Day instead of green and her husband turning this into a lesson that it's OK not to be different - at least he wasn't wearing orange:)<br /><br /> - Sheryl urges people to take risks with their jobs - it depends on the risk - generally this is a good message, but it could spell disaster<br /><br /> - negotiate - good advice<br /><br /> - Sheryl worked 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. before she had a family - a good tip<br /><br /> - Sheryl tells women they can have a family and successful career - I'm not sure this is true for all<br /><br /> - most senior female CEOs have spouses - direct contrast to my school, where teachers without husbands were revered - even having a husband for me means distraction from career, at a girls' school I never learned at an early age to handle both work and dates<br /><br /> - successful men tend to be liked in the workplace, successful women tend to have problems - too true - thanks Sheryl for researching this and explaining it clearly<br /><br /> - women need to use \\"we\\" more at work - my first instinct is repulsion - it wouldn't occur to me to think like that - a lesson to learn for future encounters<br /><br /> - be brave - essential - something I'm just learning now<br /><br /> - women need to promote their successes - great advice for the US - it probably doesn't come naturally to many immigrants and in other countries it may be frowned upon - however, reading [[ASIN:000745662X Path to Power]] and [[ASIN:0007456638 Downing Street Years]] I believe that women should be pushy despite the culture if they are to succeed<br /><br /> - how not to find a mentor - totally agree, you'll make connections if you go about your business rather than looking for mentors<br /><br />There's plenty more in the book on being authentic, being a mother (masses on that - not of interest to me  - being the eldest of 4, I decided a job was much more interesting than having children at the age of 11 and have no regrets) and finding mentors.<br /><br />After reading the book I believe that Sheryl's hard work was rewarded early in her career. She also tried hard to be liked. It enabled her to get a good internship, which led to trust from great bosses, which led to good jobs, which helped her to be proud of her accomplishments, which gave her the nerve to call Eric Schmidt for a job at Google, then recruiters approached her for a position at Facebook.<br /><br />The book has a call to action and I believe the LeanIn Circles will offer great experiences for women. Revenues from the book support the LeanIn non-profit that seeks to empower women.<br /><br />This is a great gift for a college student - male or female.  It's also great for a book group.ore in the book on being authentic, being a mother (masses on that - not of interest to me  - being the eldest of 4, I decided a job was much more interesting than having children at the age of 11 and have no regrets) and finding mentors.<br /><br />After reading the book I believe that Sheryl's hard work was rewarded early in her career.

B005LAIHZE|3.0|it was okay i read the book and was a little disappointed about some of the things that was changed from the book to the movie
1451695195|1.0|Thinks he is a genius about spirituality because of one experience.  Now openly into the occult in search of other supernatural experiences:  He is a Fool. Author is narrow minded and not educable.  You'd think he would have learned something from his experience.  Confuses supernatural experience with spiritual experience and falsely seeks supernatural experiences as means of spiritual growth.  Thinks he is spiritually advanced when he should know he isn't.  Arrogant and blind.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This was a great show. The characters are interesting and likable. The story lines had me tuning in every episode!
1455502758|2.0|Great writer with a few good thoughts well said as is his custom. Mostly a book to cash in on his death.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was so excited when this book came out and after reading it I am so disappointed.  It was like she ran out of ideas for the book and just put something in.  I don't think Sookie and sam are a good idea.  And the way stuff was left with eric was just wrong.  I wish this one would have been more thought out.  Maybe the cable show will have a better life than this book.  I might be the only one, but I thought Quinn should have had a bigger part.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome!!!!!! The graphics are so life like I have been riding horses once a week for over 6 years and almost every thing is true! It is an awesome horse game even if you can find already 20 problems in every horse game! And plus, it's free, what's to loos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|As an elementary school teacher, I read the orphan train series to my fifth graders for many years. Reading it on an adult level really made an impact ! Kline wrote a gripping story of two woman who where so different in age but shared such a similar life. Even thought this was fiction, the story of the orphan train was true. This book made my top ten list of favorite books!
B00COGY2P2|2.0|Having read all of Lee Child's books, I was so looking forward to watching this.......only to be seriously disappointed. Not even worth the little rental fee!
B00B4ENTJK|4.0|I've seen this show quite a few times. It's definitely not a Stallone flop. You get to see a guy drinking motor oil.
B003VVAE4W|4.0|Love it - can't wait to watch more.  So glad you're making a movie with this tongue in cheek character.  Hers is a voice we could use more of.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great Story, cant wait for the next season.  Its refreshing to have a show that is not focused on Drugs, Sex, and Violence.
B000RO9VJK|4.0|My business coach, Robert Chun, recommended several books and suggested I read this one first. While it is less applicable to a solo therapy practice than most small businesses, it was still helpful.<br /><br />Dividing up the responsibilities of running a business and creating systems -- so that there is, in my business, a marketing director office manager and  accountant as well as a hypnotherapist, makes it easier to organize and  &#34;chunk&#34; those tasks -- even if it is still I who does all of them.<br /><br />Ferber understands that we function best when our imaginations are engaged and does a good job of getting business owners to understand why the myth of the entrepreneur  does us a disservice. We need all of our parts : including the technician, manager and dreamer, to make a product or service that consistently delivers satisfaction.
B00BESIKWM|3.0|Ok I like a good scare sometimes and that is why I watch a horror movie that is suppose to be well, scary.  Revelation has a couple of cool moments where the monsters are in battle but on a scary meter of 1 to 5 this movie sits at 1.  I had to turn on dancing with the stars just to get my fix of fright for the night.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Takes some strategy to win, especially with more than one suit option.  If in the mood to win, one suit is usually easy to win.  Fun!
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Great movie, I love all the characters. Santa has to be the best version of &#34;Santa&#34; I have ever seen. Makes me want to believe again.  Sandman is so cute but really it is a great movie that I think kids and adults can enjoy together.
B000MDJH9A|5.0|This was by far the most incredible movie I have ever seen! Soooo worth it! I highly highly recommend watching this incredible adventurous violent action packed movie!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great book, dark, mysterious, a bit disturbing, just like the other great reads I have found in Gillian Flynn. Gone Girl is still my fave, but this is definitely a book to add to your must read list.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I have Dropbox on my computer, phone and Kindle Fire.  I love it and I can get to my documents anywhere anytime.  It is a great product.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|I was suprised I liked this. I avoided it when it was actually on. Starts out a bit hokey but works its way into a pretty good show.
B00AZKCU7G|2.0|long and tiresome.  Plot seemed very contrived and the first scene where 2 soldiers recite the Gettysburg address<br />was really unbelievable.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|I miss it. I wish they would have given josh a chance. Ending was weak but i blame fox for forcing the end.
0763644765|5.0|My 4 & 2 year old loves it! It helped them to understand that everyone needs to do their thing appropriately into the potty in a fun way. Effective for parents who are trying to potty train their kids.
0385732554|5.0|i was required to read this for a college course but was richly enlightened by all it had to offer.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Almost seemed too short. But I'm a sucker for a harlequin story so I enjoyed it anyway. I would definitely recommend it.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the show. To bad it was cancelled. Maybe I'll buy all the seasons one day. It's a good buy.
0345803507|5.0|This is a fantasy world, that I keep diving in, I love this book, lots of people will not like it but I love it
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It is amazing and inspirational,the problems Lincoln overcame.  A great book. It may be the best book I have read on Lincoln.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I use this app often. It is just the right size on my 7&#34; Fire. It does everything I want to do plus much more. This app is fast and flawless!!
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|The characters are thrown at you at first and things feel rushed, but the plots are usually interesting for syfyers. Great for light entertainment.
B007FTZDN8|4.0|The majority of TED Talks are refreshing breaks from status quo thinking... I don't know what might happen if we were all as learned as the TED presenters. Thankfully we are allowed inclusion in higher thinking and higher learning by the benefit of Ted Talks
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|I remember when The Shield originally aired but for whatever reason I never watched it, I'm glad Amazon added it to their line up because it's an excellent show, in about a week and a half I'm already midway through season 4.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I've loved this show from the beginning.  I don't love all the choices this season, as with other seasons, but overall this is one of my favorite shows.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Great product and extremely easy to use. No cords and picks up everything on carpets and bare floor<br />Thank you
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like to play the game, but don't like all the ads you have to put up with unless you upgrade.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very entertaining and challenging without being impossible to solve on your own.  I might have to check for other games made by this company as they come out.  Can't wait for the sequel!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This is a fascinating look at what former Presidents do after leaving office and how they work together.  It's very interesting and gives a totally different perspective to each of them.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|This is the Iron Man version of Temple Run. It is an endless running game (or in this case, endless flying), which really bores me, but apparently is loved by tons of people, because this and the Temple Run games receive such high praise. If you like TR, you'll like this. If not, then you won't.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is an amazing app to use. Especially if you're a horse lover. You are able to name your horse and it is very easy and simple to get gems.
0060763280|4.0|Book is excellent about how wealthy people think.  On getting wealthy the book includes excellent strategy.  It is allot about planning and thinking ahead and changing one's perspective on money.  The book includes some information on positive attitude and putting out such in the universe, although other books have more in this area.  Highly recommend for anyone interested in developing wealth.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is my first time playing slenderman and its pretty scary especially wen u need one more page to go. If you haven't played this game I recommend u try it. I got it free by using these 500 free amazon points I don't know how I got them but it really cool. Thanks amazon for these free points =)
B007HWTQQ8|4.0|I know, I know, Gibson is an anti-Semitic nut, but this is still a great film. Gibson takes a good amount of creative license (and rarely passes up an opportunity to slam non-belivers) but most of the time I like his creative choices. Particularly the flashbacks (which are not in the source material) of younger Jesus and his mother.<br /><br />Is it an Anti-Semitic film?  Only if you focus on the &#34;bad Jews&#34; and ignore the fact that EVERY ONE of Jesus's supporters are also Jewish. Pilot is practically a saint in this version; torn between conscious and duty, which is a Gibson choice that is historically inaccurate, but one that is necessary for the film's narrative. Don't look to this film for a history lesson, but rather a version of the story that shows how confident Jesus was in his mission.<br /><br />Bloody?  Yeah, we could have done without some of it.  But it's nothing we have not already seen in gangster films, and Spartacus.  I take a way one star for that. and one-half star for historical inaccuracy. (Amazon will not allow half-star reviews so I rounded up)<br /><br />Gibson choices that I didn't like:<br /><br />1) Barabus looks like a retard when history has confirmed that he was a calculating Zealot leader against the Romans. Gibson's deviation to fashion Barabus a fool makes the mob calling for his freedom over Jesus look ridiculous and robs the audience not familiar with history of the significance of the crowd's reason for this choice.<br /><br />2) Herod acts like a young child when history has shown that was a very crafty politician whose alliance with Rome  gave the region prosperity and quazi-independence over the iron fist of Rome. Gibson's choice here robs the audience not familiar with history of understanding why Herod MUST hand Jesus back to Pilot and offers only that Herod is displeased with Jesus because he will not perform parlor-trick miracles.  Bad choice Mel.  Give your audience a bit more credit.<br /><br />Over all, if you canwade through the historical inaccuracies (which I can forgive b/c let's face it, movies are just one person's view) this is really a great piece of filmmaking and one that I personally did not find offensive for non-believers.  Having said that, it's pretty clear what Mr. Gibson thinks of that group of people largely responsible for his career.  Okay, so I won't invite him to my Purim party, but I can still appreciate his talent. Right?
B0094OLFUW|5.0|The simplicity and beauty of XX's music blows me away every time I listen to either of their albums.<br />Everyone I have played it for, young or old, has also really liked it.<br />I can't wait for more!!!
B008Q0D4MW|4.0|No!!  Slow yes.  Boring? No.  This a Kubrick must.  Have some cofee handy, but it's worh the effort. Amazing photography that is studied in film schools as most all the lighting is done with candles.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Why force us to sign in to facebook just to play?  I don't get it. Rovio, stop pandering to them. Will uninstall.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is a movie worth watching.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  Some of the scenes may be a little intense for younger viewers, but they will still enjoy the movie.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Enjoyed the series very much. Follows the original stories in a modern interpretation. Smart, funny, with the infusion of British wit. Something we could watch with our ten year old son who also enjoyed them.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I may be bias but this series I watched as a kid, I remember the Arena like it was yesterday. For its time it was pretty hi tech but seems kind of old fashion with all of the high tech digital effects of today. It also made you look to the stars because at the time we only had put a man in orbit.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|GREAT game with killer graphics, this game is what free gaming is about, quality games for the masses..Keep making great stuff
B001B2CPH2|5.0|This is the epitome of a love story. Patrick Swayze at his best. Demi Moore while she was at her most gorgeous. What a couple they made!
B0049J3QF4|1.0|i was never able to watch this movie.  I ordered it to keep my child entertained abd tried multiple tines to get it downloaded.  My kindle said it was downloaded but then it would quit playing and tell me I needed to be connected to a network
B007REV4YI|5.0|I am a life long Bond fan. I was born and lived in the UK for over 20 years and there is little more British than James Bond. I have really enjoyed how Bond has changed over the years to keep up with the times but never lost that individual character that has never been duplicated. I'll never get tired of a Bond movie and can't wait for the next one!
B009XWD02G|4.0|I love getting my songs that I like to listen to. This is the first time that I have used an MP3 player. I like that it does not use too much data too.
B000066C1N|5.0|We watched the movie (again) and it struck me how great the music was. I went to buy the MP3 and found that Amazon had the CD for a dollar less and that it included the MP3 download! So now I have the CD as well! Great music, always have been a fan of Bryan Adams.
B00BDAP66E|3.0|I like knowing if I have a message right away. Facebook really gives that convenience of an app that you do not have to check the site too often if you need to.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I just started reading this novel - about one-third of the way through - and I really like the way this novel is reading. I can't wait to see how this ends up!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Good lesson on needing to listen to each other. Not just pushing our own agenda. Don't treat your children quite like children, they might surprise you!
B009NY43NY|2.0|Like some other reviewers, I didn't feel we had the same Sookie in this book.  Her happily ever after choice was the one I always figured it would be, but it was still disappointing.  If you're a true Sookie fan, you might want to just imagine what happens and forget the book.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love love love this game its better then super Mario bros wayyy better.I really recommend it for you guyed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is entertaining for both kids and adults simple but keeps you on your toes. It's full of new tracks and upgrades and its never dull or repetitive
B007IXWL2C|5.0|i couldnt put the dang book down. i loved it. but i am a sucker for these types of books. i would of liked for them to go into more detail about the wedding tho. other then that, great book.
0345803485|3.0|Love the price , since this is the first of three , I'm going to try to buy the other two from here too. The prices are right !
B009FZHYKU|4.0|First couple seasons were great!  Season three now, and the show is starting to get a bit corny, storyline and even the acting.  Hope it starts to get better again.
B000I9U75G|5.0|Godzilla is always good to watch and this one has a little different twist to it.  Godzilla in any form is grreat
B009MFKO3M|5.0|Heard the song Elephant in the Blackberry ad and I liked the song so much I tracked down the group. Awesome album. I bought the Inner Speaker album as well. Good Stuff.
B006O6F932|5.0|The school is a lot bigger than you think when it is opened up. My daughter loves it and plays with it all the time. I thought that it would be just more plastic junk, but the design is very good.
B00005N6KG|1.0|So I have continued to buy this headset over and over again. Because its cheap, light, and well...its a Sony.  But literally, every time, they simply just stop working after a few months. I usually give a product a chance since maybe when they stopped working the first time, I perhaps accidentally broke them or they broke down due to manufacturing flaw etc., so I buy them again, it happens again. I buy them again, it happens again, so I just keep buying them and returning the old ones in the new ones packages and keep the cycle going, but now they are discontinued. Just be warned, yes, cheap, yes, light, yes Sony, but wont last you for everyday gym use, etc.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ALL FRIENDS. GREAT PRICE. BEHIND THE SCENES OF HOW IT ALL WENT DOWN, LOVE THE ENDING
B004UID2LC|3.0|Would be nicer if you can play the clip first in the app before dicide to download. As it is now, i have to switch to another spp to play youtube clip the switch back to this app  to download.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this. I had this on my facebook and I forgot about it. but now that I found it ob my kindle I love it better now!!!!!
B001NLKWLW|4.0|The story is alternately told by three different women, living in different eras. The author does a wonderful job with weaving the three timelines together - it never feels like an abrupt jump, or like the story has become disjointed. Well-paced, the story is truly revealed along the journey. A good read.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|At first it seemed fine but as time when on it was boring!!!!  Certainly will not waste my time with the other two books
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Well-written, this is NOT the same story as the movie. Specifically, one can finally understand Pat - his back-story and thoughts explain so much more about the character than can be gleaned from the movie version. Similar moments and words, but a different story and well worth the read.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|My son didn't quite make it through the whole movie, but he's not one that really likes movies too much.  I was getting a bit winded toward the end and a bit confused with exactly what was going on (maybe I wasn't as engrossed as I should have been).
B007H1HQW0|5.0|again, based on the ratings, I purchased this cutter.  I work with stained glass and wanted to expand my projects in glass to make other types of projects.  Arrival was very prompt.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I can listen to this album over and over again it's so great!!! These men still got it!!!! Highly recommended
7885255921|3.0|Excellent selection of episodes but every single dvd looked flawless but every single one of them glitched so badly, they would not play and one got so &#34;stuck&#34; spinning in the tray I thought it ruined my bluray player. Huge bummer.
B00CMT54DA|5.0|Matthew McConaughey has suffered for the last decade in romantic comedy hell with films like The Wedding Planner, Fool's Gold, Sahara and How To Lose a Guy In 10 Days with the only remotely decent films in that time being Frailty and Reign of Fire. How did he manage to climb out of acting mediocrity? Well we have to go back in time to the beginning of his career before we can go forward to the present and future. McConaughey struggled early in his career in the early and mid-1990's trying to find his footing as he took minor roles in films and one starring role in the dreadful Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation. McConaughey finally got his big break in Joel Schumacher's adaptation of John Grisham's A Time to Kill starring as Jake Brigance taking the spot like from the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Spacey, Sandra Bullock and Donald Sutherland. He embodied the Grisham's character so well that you can't imagine anyone else playing the character. From A Time to Kill he moved on to the small film Lone Star followed by Contact and Amistad showing off his acting capabilities and that is how he found redemption by making better film choices as he has chosen to work with great and good directors like Christopher Nolan in Interstellar and Martin Scorsese in The Wolf of Wall Street. It seems like McConaughey decided end his reputation as a pretty boy who can't act and return to his roots showing everyone how capable of an actor he which bring us to Mud.<br /><br />Mud is an intentionally sluggishly paced coming of age drama that follows the life and struggles of Ellis (Tye Sheridan) and the friends and family around him. Ellis and his best friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) live a river life on in southern Arkansas. The two find a boat resting high up in the trees on a small island on the river as if it is a sign from heaven the boys decided to make it their own only to find that someone has been living there. That is when they encounter a man simply known as Mud. Mud tells the boys he is waiting for someone and that if they boys help him get supplies he will then give them the boat. Through their journey with Mud we explore their hard lives as they deal with divorce, young love, facing the reality of the world and growing up. Jeff Nichols's screenplay is well written and thought out and inspired from Mark Twain. Yes his screenplay is slowly paced and for one moment in the film I wanted something to explode, but that was only a brief moment and otherwise I really enjoyed the story. The only flaw I had in the film was the climax at Ellis's boat home. It just seemed out of place, forced and didn't really work for me, but once the climax was over the epilogue was great.<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon like McConaughey seems to have spent most of her career in the romantic comedy world, but unlike McConaughey Witherspoon is good at it. She is charming, beautiful and has a good sense of humor, but it is nice to see her take a dramatic risk in Mud as Juniper the woman Mud loves since he was a child and has killed for. Reese shines in her supporting role displaying her charm, but in a more of a heartbreaking way. The Incomparable Sam Shepard does an outstanding job as the Tom Blankenship the only man Mud respects and the closest thing he has to a father. Michael Shannon the ever ready quality actor does a good job as Galen, Neckbone's uncle and the man who's raised him as he tries beautifully shows the nervousness yet desire to be more than a uncle to Neckbone, but a father. The rest of the cast from Sarah Paulson, Bonnie Sturdivant and to Ray McKinnon all do a good job in their roles and add something to the film.<br /><br />Mud is a naturally beautiful film. Filmed in Dumas and Stuttgart, Arkansas Adam Stone the cinematographer does a wonderful job showing off the natural beauty of the south and Arkansas which was matched by captivating minimalistic score done by composer David Wingo that fit the sluggish pace and cinematography of the film perfectly.<br /><br />While Mud isn't perfect story wise or pacing wise it still has a really good heartwarming coming of age story that is greatly complimented by the actors such as Matthew McConaughey in his best acting job of his career, Reese Witherspoon, and Tye Sheridan and Jacob Lofland who I think have a potential of a very bright career in Hollywood. That along with the cinematography and score make Mud a great film and one of the two best films I've seen this year along with Beyond the Pines. Though I don't think the pacing of the film will make it for everyone I still I highly recommend Mud before the deluge of the summer films starting next week.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love love love this show cannot wait to watch more and more and more of it.  Even have my 9 year old into it as well.
0394800192|5.0|Great for helping kids learn to count based on visual stimuli and put forth in a fun and interesting way.
0060254920|5.0|Bought this for my three year old Grandson. He really enjoys it when I read  to him from the book.
1616550414|5.0|Beautiful just amazed.Totally met my expectations of all the detail history plus the character concept art.Plus the time line explanation it was cool.<br />Thank you!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I started watching this in the same way I would any movie - purely for its entertainment value. It is a little slow getting started and because it is a story told by a individual who speaks English with a British/Indian accent thru narration it is sometimes difficult to understand for an American like myself. However, because of a twisting the ending, I probably need to watch it again. I won't explain as that would make this a spoiler review. However, I would listen carefully to the lead-in to the telling of the story to help you anticipate the ending.
B00993FEUK|5.0|I loved this movie. The animation was amazing and the story was thrilling to the end. Can be a little scary for the little ones. For ages 7-97.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Well scripted and performed, with plenty of action to keep things moving - and even guest appearances by John Barrowman! - Arrow certainly doesn't disappoint.
B00AO686MY|5.0|I been waiting for this to come out on blu ray for quite some time now and here it is. Its great to see it, on blu ray I use to watch it on t.v when it was aired. I received it very quickly from the seller. I didn't own the vhs or dvd version. Now I do dvd and blu ray. Picture is crisp and clear and the sound is great.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The final book of the Brandon Sanderson/Robert Jordan partnership draws this epic tale to a satisfying conclusion. For me, I think that Brandon Sanderson has done a superb job and, if anything, slightly improved on the original authorship. Sanderson keeps the action and the story moving through the final phases of this saga admirably well whereas I found the original author tended to err on the long winded side of things. All credit to Sanderson for staying true to the spirit of Jordan's narrative but you can tell it's a Sanderson piece.
0393338398|5.0|As someone who has no interest in Baseball (being British), the book was fascinating and engrossing. A must for sports fans and analytics alike.
0345803507|5.0|It was interesting.  I liked that I could pass them onto friends who were interested in reading this trilogy.<br />Can't wait to see the movie
B00009ATIX|4.0|I am selling my copy of Solaris. Good soundtrack. It moves at a slow pace. Clooney is always great. Very eerie things are going onboard the space station and Chris Kelvin (Clooney) has been sent to investigate. Good cinematography. You might also like Moon, Apollo 18, Angels & Airwaves present LOVE and 2001: A Space Odyssey. I also suggest books by Stephen Baxter especially Destiny's Children series, Doctor Who and The official sequel to HG Wells Time Machine; The Time Ships.
B00BEU19ZU|4.0|It's very good at the airport angle; perhaps leaves something to be desired on the flight tracking aspect.  Most frequent fliers would find it helpful to navigate the airports and decide which ones to choose or avoid.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Kept you interested and intrigued.  Some of the twists  were a bit over the top but overall it was a great romance :)
B0066WJLU6|5.0|The application does exactly what it promises to do. It is bright and easy to use. No complaints, especially for a free application.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|You know how when you are in a museum, and you see bowl of fruit and you just sort of walk by it because it's boring compared to everything else? Yea, that how I feel about this soundtrack if it had been purely 20s music. I think that's what the OTHER Gatsby movie is for.<br /><br />People - HELLO!!!  This was an appropriate and proportionate interpretation of music in this movie!! It fit the storyline to a perfect T! I couldn't have been happier with it, and I haven't stopped listening to it since it's release. And considering the director and his other films, anyone expecting a liner soundtrack is seriously responsible for their own disappointment. See the other movie if you want a Jazz age soundtrack. If you want a compelling arrangement that will carry the storyline beyond the screen, this is the one for you. I only wish they would include the instrumental versions of the songs, but maybe in a few weeks it'll come out.
B005D4YHP2|5.0|These are the third pair of Newports that I've bought over the last 7-8 years - they're about as good as sandals can get! They are good for hiking or casual walking, protect your feet really well, can be worn safely in water, dry easily, wear really well, and last a long long time. And they're comfortable right out of the box - no breaking in required!<br /><br />About the only minor regret I have is that the leather on the wren/bronze green that I bought recently seems just a little stiffer and less supple than those on the bison that I owned previously.  Or maybe it's just the wear and all the water dunking that made my old pair so darn comfortable!
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I purchased this movie as a gift for my grandaughter.  She has a thing for vampires and Lincoln.  She had seen the movie at the theater and asked for it as a gift.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app.  It is great that it gives you free access to many translations and studies for the bible believing person.  I have it on my kindle fire HD and had no problems at all.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Surprisingly good -- I knew the basic plot prior to reading it but none of the intricacies.  Well written with all of the standard elements of a &#34;classic&#34;.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|With hindsight we would do well to remember how many critics thought that Vampire Weekend's eponymous debut might be their first and last record. The \\"Upper West Side Soweto\\" template did seem to offer limited development opportunities and suspicions lingered that this was just a slice of novelty cultural tourism by (at best) a bunch of privileged preppy white boys and at worse four Ivy League bozo's. Their excellent sophomore album \\"Contra\\" started to suggest a band with much greater staying power who were moving into very interesting darker corners. Now their third album \\"Modern Vampires of the City\\" confirms a new album that is an undoubted keeper by a band who must now be ranked as best amongst their peer group. Repeated listens confirm an almost perfect pop album strong on infectious song-smithery, populated with hooks large enough to catch Tuna and lyrics so smart you can award an A+ diploma to each track. Yes MVOTC is essentially about New York but within its vinyl grooves are songs which tackle themes of faith, death and after-life albeit with a broad smille on their face. While at one time the band may have seen \\"the dawn in the colours of Bennetton\\" this superficiality has passed and the opener \\"Obvious bicycle\\" it is so beautifully melancholic that it could appear on a Mercury Rev album. The same applies to \\"The Unbelievers\\" which sounds like Buddy Holy's \\"Peggy Sue\\" rewritten for the 21st Century with a splash of world music thrown in for good measure. Ezra Koenig's skills are brilliantly honed on an album standout \\"Step\\" which is both a doo-wop track with harpsichord and shows that he has studied his Brian Wilson songbook well. It is a gorgeous song that cries out for the repeat button. The foot is further pressed down on the gas pedal for the buoyant single \\"Diane Young\\" surely destined to be the 'alternative' pop record of the summer? It is worth checking out the \\"making\\" of this song on the net which forms part of the excellent series of videos where the band enlist as their \\"Director\\" the actor Steve Buscemi to hit the streets to hustle New Yorkers into buying tickets to their Roseland Ballroom concert.<br /><br />Darker hues are fleshed out on the rubbery pop of \\"Everlasting Arms\\" a lush pounding song with a infectious drum undercurrent, wobbling bass and on repeated listens a rather funky sheen. Then we have the ubiquitous \\"Ya Heh\\" which has just about colonised every music blog for the last month with its regretful lyric of \\"America don't love you\\" and huge cartoon character backing to the infectious chorus and an ending to die for. Lookout in addition for \\"Hanna Hunt\\" which shows how Koenig's songwriting craft is maturing at warp speed not least the wistful line \\"If I can't trust you then damn it Hannah, there's no future, there's no answer.\\" The ultimate sign of a great pop band in this reviewers humble opinion is to construct a pop song at around two minutes and make it indelibly mark.. The 1.45 seconds of the last track \\"Young Lion\\" achieves this with a gentle rolling piano and melody that sticks like superglue. Granted it is still early days with \\"Modern Vampires\\" and one of the longest tracks on the record \\"Hudson\\" has yet to really land a blow. This is countered by the sheer fun and outrageous audacity of \\"Finger love\\" which could happily grace an Animal Collective album and fit like a glove. The spoken interlude in the song is followed by Keonig recalling \\"Remembrances of holy days in Tarrytown and Rye/I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die\\". Finally \\"Worship you\\" reminds you of the theme tune for the old series Bonanza, surely always a great sign?<br /><br />While \\"Modern Vampires of the City\\" may not be the best album of 2013 (time will tell) it is by a country mile the most enjoyable listening experience of the year thus far. It is a life affirming album by a band entering their prime. The good news is that any doubt around the longevity of Vampire Weekend is dispelled by this record. This fact alone should be a cause of celebration. A while ago one Amazon reviewer had the audacity to describe Vampire Weekend as the new Talking Heads. They are two very different beasts but in the context of this new album we get a huge pot pourri of whimsical, esoteric lyrics combined with a mix of elements of punk rock, art rock, avant-garde, pop, funk, world music, and Americana. Does this sound familiar? Whatever the case \\"Modern Vampires\\" is a completely joyful album which you are going to want to own pronto.. This fact alone should be a cause of celebration.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|Room was a shocking read.  It is such a possible story that it made me feel sympathy for Jack and his ma.  The story being from Jack`s point of view was brilliant.  Well written and great ending.
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|The acting was very believable. The story line and ending is about as twisted as one can get.  Although Scott Derrickson hasn't achieved the notariety expected from a film of this quality, he will.  This movie was produced on a $3 million budget and quietly brought in over $87 million.  His blockbuster, The Day The Earth Stood Still, brought in over $233 million.  So Scott knows how to be a screenwriter and did so very well with Sinister.
B000E5N62U|5.0|I don't agree with the reviews that rate this at 3 or less stars. DF never made a record that deserved less than 4 out of a possible 5 stars. I've been a big fan of DF ever since the Summer of 1973 when we first got a hold of Can't Buy a Thrill record and played it over my Miracord 750H Mk II and Sherwood S7900a.<br /><br />I got this MP3 file from amazon, along with his other recent album \\"Sunken Condos\\", and after a while I determined I like Morph the Cat better than the Condos album, but I'm not complaining about Sunken Condos! I'm getting hooked on \\"H Gang\\", What I Do\\" and the rest of the Morph CD. It's really good.<br />Thanks Donald. Rock on and live long.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Best.game.ever. I love it. My mom got me hooked on it. Play it on my kindle every night. I do wish it was a shorter time between gaining energy though.
B000X9NI5W|5.0|Burial has become one of my favorite producers.  This is just the first purchase in the collection I plan on having of his music.  Now that I have a record player, I will likely purchase an actual or two if I can.  He has a distinct signature sound that is present through the whole album.  It's a good one to work too (I put it on when I paint), because it's so steady.
B00CRXJWZC|1.0|Just let me watch my goddam show! Stop telling me I've reached my viewing limit when I'm only watching it on my goddam PC!
B0033806MI|4.0|Very short and quick unfortunately, but excellent to read and follows on the same lines as the series.<br />Must read for fans.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a must buy game.Good to pass the time.Me and my little 3 year old cousin love building towers and pixel art.An amazing game really worth the 3.99$
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Love this app havn't really used it much yet, but the time i did was awesome its like photoshop somewhat.
B001UGDYO2|4.0|I wanted this on DVD and it was added to my computer video library.  My fault, but can it be switched to DVD?
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|interesting for the kids to look at but not a lot of intereaction for younger kids who don't know how to accomplish goals. but great color.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I'm ten and almost eleven and I love this game. this game is really fun and not hard at all.I really do love this game.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I've been reading about Sookie since 2004. I really loved and savored this series early on but somewhere in the middle, or last 3rd, it really lost it's charm & magic. It became predictable and uninspired. This last book I had hoped may be good since it was the last Charlaine would write in her hugely successful series. This book was the second worse (if not the worst) of her whole series. The plot was both extremely predictable, non-sensical, and simply poorly conceived. Our beloved characters were not themselves.<br /><br />I don't blame Harris because she gave so much pleasure for so long and I know it was lucrative, especially since the True Blood pick up. However, I would have appreciated Charlaine giving her last book, and Sookie, a proper farewell.<br /><br />So long Sookie, we still love you.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|An excellent cerebral law adventure.  Margulies is terrific...a look from her is enough....Chris Noth is very good.  We find the stories to be similar to those we read in the headlines and are anxious to see how the lawyers handle them.  The inside the practice intrigue is done very well.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This was a good book. I enjoyed the characters. Sometimes the racing stuff got be a little too much for me! But I fell in love with Enzo!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Everyone needs this CD its positively the best music ever! the only thing better is listening to Babel when this ones done!
0385742886|5.0|This book is great and arrived in great condition. Very good price and care. For those wanting to read this series, I recommend reading the prequel last. It was the way the author wrote the series. Very good book!
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I do not understand the point. It is so random. I did not thinnk it would turn out this BAD. Very underwhelming
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|I was afraid it might be boring, being 2 1/2 hours long, but it was gripping the whole time.  VERY well acted.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Decent comedy. There are several laugh out loud moments which is also a good sign. The story line is pretty lame and predictable but the humor and comedy well compensates for that
B0055B7IPE|4.0|A cute movie that inspires. Sad at the beginning (why do they Bambi us like that?), but inspiring at the end.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very different type of story that kept my interest. This is the first book I read by this author and would read another.
B000QI2ZWW|1.0|Why do people like this insipid video? We were searching for something to watch with our three year old that doesn't have violence. But OMG, this was terrible. We just kept looking at one another and groaning. My there year old, howevere loved it and asked to watch it again (sob).
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Great work, i love the progression of characters and the entwining plots that started with your novella and lead us into the second book!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I was totally disappointed with the whole trilogy but the third part was totally unrealistic.  I would feel very sorry for their child/children since they are both very disturbed people.  E. L. James made Christian Grey a millionaire - what if he was just an ordinary working person?  She would have not sold many copies!  This is strictly a money making venue.  She is not a good writer either.
B0097PW7H8|3.0|I have found that battery doctor helps some for a month or so and then uninstall it and your battery will last longer. I uninstalled it from my phone a day and a half ago and the phone is still holding a good charge. I haven't done the same with my Kindle yet so I can't say yet but I have a sneaky suspicion my battery has to be charged nightly now.<br />It's a great app for getting a good charge set up but it eats up battery after that.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|If you want a deep and engaging plot... Read a book. This movie is entertaining, violent, and full of cheesy one liners.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I like Nemo' s reef. The controls are simple. The goals and instructions are clear. Any one could easily play this game. The best part of the game is because it is so much fun.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love having this app loaded on my Kindle as I have the &#34;weather&#34; at my fingertips.  I like that I can check local weather and weather for places we are travelling to.
B0013D8G7C|5.0|It's a great album!! It shows that Alicia can really sing. It's a mix of songs from different albums too. She gets hoarse but she still sounded great all the way through.
B000URWYTS|5.0|This is a very engaging and revealing book about the love affair between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mumma Borthwick Cheney, while he was still married to his first wife, Catherine.  The reader is pulled into the Victorian era where women's rights were severely limited and where women's identities was almost totally entwined with that of their husbands and children. The frustration and thoughts of a brilliant woman, who was way ahead of her time, is brought to life by this author who skillfully and cleverly filled in the gaps of time by using documented information, even though some details appeared to be scarce.  The book mentions journal's that were kept by Mumma Bothwick Cheney, but it is difficult to determine if they survived. Mumma appeared to struggle with every aspect of her position as the live-in lover of a great, very public man, who was significantly eccentric in his own right.  She did love him, though; thus, her own tremendous personal sacrifices and the revealing title of the book. One will never know what would have happened between them as time went on, if a tragedy had not occurred that ended her life. History shows that Frank did marry two other women after divorcing his first wife, following Mumma's death.  The book is well written and organized with details of other real-life characters, the houses that Frank designed and definitely engages the reader from beginning to end.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Game with a menu like jetpack joyride and I love to see the little spoofs of other games in there good game worth it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love it! Just wish you didn't have to pay for additional hints. Otherwise it is great fun, good problem solving,  but very addictive.
B00BC24NT4|2.0|A disappointing book, mainly a polemic on an issue, an important and disturbing one to be sure, but with an obvious plot, no surprises, and with characters that are either too good or too and b-a-a-a-d to be credible.  None of the fascinating conflicts present in Smiley or Leamus or Hayden or Karla.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have always loved this book I like the straight cliff hanger ending it just makes you want to read mocking Jay to find out what happened to district 12 it's so exciting &lt;3
B0064MGU98|5.0|A fascinating series, with a good cast of,chad extorts that have been well developed.,highly recommended for anyone interested in law or simply in a well done drama
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This may be the best book about empowerment of women I have read.  Her writing is not difficult or overly dense, and yet it is full of insight and wisdom.  I particularly appreciate the even-handedness with which she talks about both men and women.  The point about women needing to lean in toward the workplace and men needing to lean in toward the home is well taken!
0425252868|5.0|Other reviewers have written more detailed reviews than mine will be. I have read books on the subject of WWII since I was in college and that was a long time ago. The story of these two men and especially Franz really is an incredible story. And Adam Makos makes the story come alive with his writing. This is one of the most wonderful books written, not only of the events during WWII, but also the story of these two men. If you are a fan of Ambrose or Kershaw or any of the other great authors on WWII, you have to read this book.<br /><br />The final chapter, Was It Worth It, had me in tears when the two men finally met. I loved it so much that I read it again a second time. It was exceptional reading.<br /><br />Enough said...just get the book and read it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great for kids and adults it is a amazing. Game for everyone great get it or u will be missing out on a amazing game
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Sharply writing, witty and entertaining.  A read you should take the time to enjoy even though it is also frightening.
B00CHILW64|5.0|It was a very heart filled movie about that terrible Tsumani. Well acted and tearful. Based on a true story.
1599290634|2.0|TOO MUCH ENPHASIS IN THE HORROR THEMES THAT I DO NOT LIKE .  MAYBE IT NEEDS MORE PRESENCE OF ARTISTS LIKE JULIE BELL, ROWENA MORRILL, BORIS VALLEJO, JAMES GURNEY, DONATO GIANCOLA, ETC., ETC.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I was almost not going to read this final book when I saw all the negative reviews out there.  I rather enjoyed this quick read and wasn't completely disappointed with this ending.  So try not to read too many reviews before you get soured on this book - if anything its closure on an amazing series which I will sincerely miss.
B008HI7BMW|5.0|I adore this soundtrack.  I have The Dark Knight as well which was awesome, but this one is even better.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|When this was in the theaters a friend of mine had seen it and afterward insisted that i go with him to see it again in the theaters. By the time Guy is calling for his \\"mommy\\" in the shuttle scene going to the planet for a varillium sphere i had already been wiping tears of laughter from my face.<br /><br />We saw it one more time.<br /><br />I have since bought the movie (as soon as it came out) and have seen it so many times that i still don't know where to start when it comes to telling HOW WONDERFULLLLL this movie is.  I've shown this to my mother (who is up in age) and at several points almost fell out her seat from bending over in laughter. She was smiling from ear to ear after the movie; she told me the movie made her day as she was wiping warm laugh tears from her face. She thouroughly enjoyed  the charachters and their anxt.  If you are a Kirk Star Trek fan-you will get it.If you are not-You still will get it.  This movie is hillarious, fun, and SPOT ON as a spoof, and you REALLY care about the charachters. Gets this!!! I feel like a big kid when i watch this and a unapologetic goofy adult at the same time watching this, all i know is that i smile all the way through with it. I soooo want a sequel!!!!!!!!!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble is consistently a great performer and this CD is just more proof.  I have seen him in concert and will always enjoy his music.  This CD includes great cover songs that he makes his own.  This is a really good CD that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys this type of music.
B007HC3LHS|1.0|I would not recomend this book to anyone. Just a terrible read, very boring and slow moving.  Thousands of books out there that are much better............
B00127RAJY|4.0|It's a good workout for 20 minutes but there are no breaks (not even for water) The only thing I don't like about it is that you cannot skip to the workouts, you have to listen to the introduction every time you workout.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin Dozer is a highly addictive game.  You'll find youself shaking the device trying to 'tilt' the table.  whatever you do, do NOT sell the prizes!!
B008602KQI|1.0|the show was excellent for the first hour.  apparently amazon instant movies only streams one hour before telling you to try again later.  as this has happened to me with every movie; I have found if I want to watch a complete item I must pick a tv program.  this is not necessarily a comment on the hunger games now is it?  it is a comment on amazon instant movies ... what can I say?<br /><br />Loved the books; loved the first hour.
B007G92QGO|5.0|This book was hard to put down, it was a new author to me. I will be reading more of his books. It makes you think about what you would do for your child under difficult circumstances.<br />Mothers and fathers love is thought provoking.<br />I loved it.
B008RC72G8|1.0|The DVD would not play in any device at all, not blue ray, not DVD, not in my AV system not on my computer not in any player.<br />Boo on the seller!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Never read anything from this author before, but loved this book. Made me think about kids lives and how it can affect them in adult times. Would read this author again.
B00AAQHP66|4.0|This movie is a good adventure story.  It has an interesting plot showing growth of the characters.  I have recommended it to others.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This book kept you reading, wanting to find out more. Alot of twists in there that kept you guessing. Not a book I would of normally read, but so glad i did. You will enjoy this book.
B009KNPNT6|4.0|Nobody else has noticed this? Anniversary on the back is spelled with 3 \\"N's\\" Maybe I have a really rare issue>
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is such fun, it works great on the kindle Fire. I would recommend it for old and the young.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My granddaughter can't wait to see my Kindle when she visits so she can play Dr. Panda's Veggie Garden.  She has learned that blueberries grow on bushes and potatoes and carrots grow underground.  I am looking forward to downloading more Dr. Panda apps.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter loves this game!  My only recommendation is to make sure the settings on your pad or kindle are set to require a password so they can't buy gems...but then it should have a password anyway...
B0088W7VNG|5.0|The writing improved year after year, and what really cinched it was the final episode. In what is usually a cliffhanger, this episode ended the series on a fantastic note, while still leaving room for the possibility of continuing the adventure. Watch all five years from beginning to end; you won't be disappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought the book was pretty interesting, I always wanted to know what was going to happen next. I was kinda thrown by the ending, but what's the fun in a predictable book?
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I thought this was going to be a typical action flick. I was very suprised to get into the story. I didn't want it to end.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I have played this game on someone else's Kindle and found that I would like to have it on my personal Kindle.
0060090383|5.0|Great fun as always with a Marian Keyes novel, this chapter in the Walsh sisters' story did not disappoint.  Worth the time.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|A well built game that's fun to play and teaches you alot about marine life and how they interact with different types of animals and plants. I recommend this game to all my friends. Very addictive.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Jumps right in where the second book of the trilogy left off.  Not too much review or repeating of other books  given to catch up.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Oh my god this book is amazing! It was sad… but the ending was happy. I loved the part about how Gale was also made of fire and so was Katniss and she needed someone like Peeta who was happy and would brighten her day up.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you don't read this one the other two don't complete the story.  After the rumors of the book topics I was afraid to start.  It kept me glued to the story. I was sorry to finish it but very satisfied with the ending.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I am an ex-christian and this work definitely help me figure out lots of question and encourage to think for myself. I just finished read the morality without religion chapter, the selfish gene and Darwinian explanation of morality is so inspiring for. I was not a guy who interest in science before but after read it i feel i am more interested in it and i feel like its just amazing to know more about the planet we live in. Thanks Richard Dawkins, his writing  debate and lecture really help me a lot in building my think about the science and reasoning. This is the man who changed my world.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|This is so cool!  Its been billed as the favorite and most unlikely trilogy of our time.  Don't consider watching it until you've seen Before Sunrise though.  The third one is called Before Midnight and will be out May 24, 2013.  Amazing chemistry between these two and obviously the director, as well.  You won't be dissappointed.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid... This book is AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!! I would recommend it to any third to eighth grader.  How could anyone not be moved by the Halloween part?
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This season has it ALL. It's like the writers wanted to make up for the relatively boring Season 6. Always a lot of impelling things going on.
B00005JOHC|5.0|hilarious comedy not suiting for viewers under the age of 16. Will have you dropping from your seat with laughter. Charlie Sheen excels at his role. Berta and Jake are great at theirs too.
0321885112|4.0|An excellant book that presents a radical approach to taking notes.  I've been doing something close to SketchNoting every since I purchased my iPad but Mr. Rohde's has helped me take my note taking to a new level.  Highly recommend this book and challenge the reader to go beyond their initial resistance and try SketchNoting in their work and life.
B007C12RDS|5.0|This is a nuanced tale with intriguing characters. The story takes us beyond stereotypes to make the characters real and to reveal their stories.
B002GHHHH4|5.0|This movie shows the love that can grow between two strangers. A perfect family bonding like movie for both the old and young to watch. It shows the hardships of life between two totally opposite people and how they manage to it work together and become who they need to be for each other.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This is such a great show...  I am seldomly surprised and this show keeps me in smiling in suspense! Enjoy!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I used to love playing Aids transport tycoon but can't play that game since computers have been running to fast and there's no updates. Having this game on my kindle has cured my lack of game play and its even more enjoyable than the tycoon was. It's a lot simpler to make sure that all transports are going to what business that is needed.
B004FGMDOQ|1.0|A very peculiar book indeed!  It's a very strange story that I still don't really get.  It's all about finding yourself & I guess your purpose but in a very strange way.  Didn't care for this book.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|The kind of movie that keeps you glued to your chair. even though I could pause and do 'things' I found myself watching the whole movie before 'taking care of business' - will watch again (3 times already)
B00CBKVGGY|5.0|Loved this movie! Great cast, action packed and has it's funny moments too, would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that likes gangster movies.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Very entertaining and fun to watch. Special effects were great, story line great. very enjoyable and will watch again. aloha
0385535147|4.0|After nearly 4500 reviews on The Racketeer, what can I add?  It is an exhaustive chronicle of a highly improbable plot to score.  Ex-inmate-innocent-of-money-laundering-crime Malcolm Bannister trades his secret to the FBI for commutation of his sentence. Then we embark on an odyssey of scamming that he has had all the time in the world in prison to dream up. It was worth sticking to though I have doubts about the moral balance between drug trafficking and murder. But it's fiction after all.
B005LAIIHG|1.0|Special effects fine but Way to drawn out, just plain boring. I I had seen it first I would NOT have bought it!
B003WUYRGI|2.0|I'm just getting started with using the Kindle, so maybe I need to learn how to navigate through the process. I would have expected to see a search so I could type in the word rather than scroll through pages. If in fact there is such a thing, then I would give it 4 Stars.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is an excellent adaptation of the Hobbit.  Jackson has done it again.  I think Martin Freeman is perfect in the role of Bilbo.  Richard Armitage surprised me as the choice for Thorin, but he is wonderful.  All the dwarves are fantastic.  I enjoyed the expanded role for Radagast;  Sylvester McCoy is quirky and convincing.  It was good to see so many of the same crew from Lord of the Rings lending their talents once again to this production.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very good free mahjong game.  Lots of levels and variety of games.  Tiles are esay to figure out, but just different enought to give extra challange.  Fun and challanging!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved how interactive it is, but too short. The Sound effects were great. Very spooky but realistic. This game really makes you think but it's not too hard. Great game, keep em coming! I want more rooms!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|the movie was long. it had some super funny moments but it got redundant. original much better. would totally watch if it was a tv series...
B00873GRU4|4.0|Kept me interested and intrigued.  Easy to read.  Actually haven't quite finished it, but will definitely be looking for the next in the series...

B0091LS0BU|5.0|Even a fan who has been fully acquainted with Sir Paul's masterpieces can find Live Kisses comparable to a breath of fresh air in the man's music making history. It definitely unveils talents that I thought were not basically his. Hence the sweet surprise. Live Kisses is laudably spontaneous and authentic. Uniquely majestic!
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Tarantino's way of telling story in any of his movies is basically \\"Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah,\\" and then follow by extreme violence. To another scene, and again, \\"Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah,\\" and then follow by extreme violence. If you look at most of his recent movies, they are kinda linear and violent, nothing more, nothing less. But I will say this, Django makes you want to keep watching hoping that something extraordinary is going to happen. Well, it didn't. It has never had, not since Kill Bill's surprise ending, anyway. As for violence, I thought it is carefully crafted and not gross -- and, in some occasions, comical. So, decent movie but disappointing. And I want to give it more stars, but all those award nominations really irritate me.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Love this! Gorgeous graphics, fast paced. Hard to stop playing once I get started, kind of like a vortex of gaming.
B00BF11STU|1.0|watching people getting torture in movie isn't much of an entertainment, is it? But that's what get produce quite alot in film industry. From Braveheart, Casino Royale, this one, Django and many more. Maybe filmmakers kinda respond to torture as art and award recognition. For the movie itself, I couldn't follow all the names of terrorists and actually stop caring for what the main character tried to accomplish. And the ending made me wonder how the SEAL team was portrayed as a bunch of turtles!

B003L16FAE|5.0|There are a lot of people who have said that the ultimate hunter edition looks to glossy or to fine like they just made the film in todays time instead of 1987. The film has always looked grainy and dirty to me and I never liked the quality of it until this edition. Everything in the jungle scenes really seem to come to life in essence from the transfer. So if you want to watch this movie in a totally redun fashion than you'll love this edition otherwise you might like the edition that came out in 2008. 5/5 stars

B0064MPXFA|5.0|Found this series to be very intelligent and non-formulaic, with engrossing plots and likable characters. There is the usual overemphasis on romantic encounters, but not enough to distract from the clever dialogue and engaging courtroom squabbles.
B0061QD7YS|5.0|One of the best Disney movies ever.  The package of bluray,  vhs and digital copy is good.  To make it great the digital copy needs to be vudu or equivalent cloud based.

B009NY43NY|1.0|*** SPOILERS ***<br /><br />I have read so many of the reviews that have been posted and I completely understand where people are coming from.<br /><br />I have been a fan of these books since she started writing them. I've followed them all since book one. Spent my hard earned money on these books and the little spare time I have consumed by these books. What did I get in return you ask. Well, I got a slap in the face.<br /><br />In the beginning the books and characters were phenomenal! I couldn't read them fast enough, then about the time that HBO got their claws in the rights to the characters the books started going downhill. Its almost like Harris saw what HBO was doing with her characters and she either got bummed out that she didn't think of it first, or she feared that her fans would like the HBO characters better so she just decided to stop trying. This is the first time Harris blatantly disrespects her fans and followers.<br /><br />I was seeing red when Harris completely emasculated Eric. The fans love ERIC. I'm sorry but let's be honest... we read your books for ERIC, because it sure isn't you creative writing abilities. I would say a good 85% of your fans are fans of  ERIC or ERIC & SOOKIE. Why oh why would you cut him out in such a horrendous way. Eric just walked away from Sookie like she never meant anything to him. He didn't fight for her or fight for what they had. Instead he simply walked away. That's so not like him. If you're going to write him out of her life you need to at least do it in such a way that it's in line with Eric's character. You spent so many books building up to his relationship with Sookie and showing the readers that he really did love her and then he was written off in the contents of a couple of pages.<br /><br />In addition to that Harris spent the previous 12 books showing that Sookie and Sam were just good friends and nothing more. There was example after example where they would have a quasi intimate moment and then Sookie or Sam would bring up that they are just really good friends and they don't want to ruin the friendship. Then suddenly Sam can't hold back how he REALLY feels about Sookie and she couldn't wait to jump in the sack with him. Harris made their feelings towards each other appear as quickly as she made Eric disappear. It felt forced or rushed. Another reviewer said it perfectly when she said \\"Harris had to shoehorn Sam into the happily ever after\\".<br /><br />The other big thing that really bothered me about this book was that its the final book in a series about VAMPIRES, and with the exception of a couple scenes involving Eric/Pam/Karin and a couple scenes involving Bill there are NO VAMPIRES in this book! The majority of this book is about the demons, werewolves, and shifters. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!?!?!<br /><br />The way I pretty much look at this book is that Harris took her characters and did whatever she wanted with them regardless of how her fans/followers would feel about it. She pretty much walked out of our lives and chucked us the bird on the way out the door. Thanks Ms. Harris now I really know what you think about your fans. I will never read another one of your books again.kie or Sam would bring up that they are just really good friends and they don't want to ruin the friendship.

B001MSD2U4|5.0|Like many people, I saw a movie first. Naturally, due to media constraints, you expect certain amount of the book to be homogenized. Therefore, I wanted to read what was missing. To my amazement very little was missing or modified. I do not normally read this sort of book. Therefore, I was surprised at finding myself wanting more when it finished.<br /><br />In addition, until I read the book I did not realize that Charing Cross Road was a real place. The whole book is based on a collection of correspondence between Helene Hanff, an avid book reader, and Frank Doel an agent for British bookseller.<br /><br />My wife has taken this one-step further and is collecting all the books that were mentioned in the correspondence. Some of these books appear to have been reprinted due to this publication.<br /><br />If you can find it there is a book called &quot;The Library of Helene Hanff.&quot;<br />I wonder what became of all the other people described in the correspondents after the book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00003CX8N 84 Charing Cross Road]]

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how challenging this game can be, despite its apparent simplicity. I also enjoy the fact that each puzzle can be completed (or at least attempted) in a few minutes. This makes it ideal for a quick diversion when you need to clear your mind or recharge for a few minutes. A great free game.

B00821OX98|3.0|Good show, a little slow and less action than what I was hoping for. For the most part good storyline and it did keep me interested and wanting to watch season 2.
B00BESIKWM|5.0|Same creepy, eerie atmosphere as the first. I love horror but not so fond of slasher films. Gore is just gore and not scary. I love a film that leaves me feeling a bit unsettled and the creatures in theses movies do just that. The suspense was good. I would recommend this film to those who enjoyed the first.

B0090SI4OC|2.0|How do you turn a 619 page bestseller into a movie? Andrew Niccol had the challenge of directing the adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's The Host. I have been a huge fan of The Host since I read it in May 2012 and I had such high expectations for this movie. I was pretty disappointed with the film adaptation of The Host.<br /><br />  The Host starts off with a bang and immediately takes viewers into the complex world of the Souls and Hosts. Saoirse Ronan is a rebel named Melanie who gets captured by the Souls and she becomes a Host to Wanderer (Wanda). Wanda's job is to find Melanie's brother (Chandler Canterbury) and Melanie's boyfriend, Jared (Max Irons). Wanda is not prepared for the troubles of being human. Wanda meets up with Jamie and Jared but not everyone is happy to see her. Ian (Jake Abel) soons become entangled in Melanie's life.<br /><br />  The Host is pretty true to it's source material, there are only a few differences between the novel and movie. The problem is not with the concept of the movie but how The Host is executed. I feel like the cast members of The Host lacked passion for their characters.<br /><br />  A majority of the acting in The Host lacks the raw and powerful emotion found in the novel. Saoirse Ronan does a decent job at playing both Melanie and Wanda. I didn't really feel any empathy toward Melanie and Wanda when I saw the movie. When I read The Host, both characters really struck a chord with me emotionally. Both love interests Jared and Ian weren't exactly convincing in portraying their characters. I didn't feel like Ronan had any chemistry with Irons or Abel, the romance just didn't feel existent. Sure, Ronan kept locking lips with Irons and Abel but I didn't think their characters true felt any love towards each other.<br /><br />  I think the most exceptional performances are carried out by Diane Kruger and William Hurt. Kruger's portrayal of The Seeker was extremely terrifying and powerful. Every single time I saw Kruger character, I was ready for a fabulous performance. William Hurt was the best choice for Jeb and his portrayal of Jeb was simply perfect. Hurt shows so many different angles of his character and his performance truly captured the essence of Jeb's character.<br /><br />  Plotwise The Host moves at a ridiculously slow pace and I think the movie should have been edited better. The transitions between each scene were not smooth and were a bit on the awkward side. The Host is about what it means to be human and yet this message seemed to be lost in this adaptation. There was none of the powerful messages and motifs that I remember reading about it Meyer's novel.<br /><br />  Also lost in translation to the big screen was Jared and Ian. Jared and Ian were huge parts of the novel and yet in the movie they didn't feel so significant. The \\"love box\\" (4 love interests) felt extremely fake because the viewer can't connect with any of the main characters. Jake Abel's performance is extremely unconvincing, he transitions almost instantaneously from wanting to kill Wanda to falling for her. I expected to see Abel slowly fall in love with Wanda but this was not the case. The dialogues between Wanda and Jared and Wanda and Ian were extremely memorable in the novel. This movie adaptation doesn't feature 95% of my favorite quotes from the novel.<br /><br />  I seem to focus on what I didn't like but there were many things I really liked about The Host. I loved the way all of the futuristic technology was shown in The Host. Also all of the action scenes were extremely intense and well done.  I would love to see more of the action scenes because I really enjoyed watching them.It was interesting to see how the makers of The Host's interpretation of Souls. Though I complained about the acting in this film, the acting wasn't terrible.<br /><br />  The Host is a mediocre movie ruined by unconvincing acting, an extremely slow pace, and badly written script. While watching The Host I was extremely antsy and I feel like this movie could have been a half hour shorter. I know all of the cast members have expressed interests in making The Host a franchise. I would definitely see a sequel but I would probably wait till it gets released on DVD.  I think I would have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't read the novel. The novel is far better than the movie and I would recommending reading the book instead. The Host wasn't the worst movie I have seen but it certainly wasn't the best.sy and I feel like this movie could have been a half hour shorter.

B0070Y46UY|1.0|The kid doesn't even get on the boat until about halfway through the book.  The attempt to wrap readers up in the trio of religions was lost on me. Page upon page upon page of gore.  Hyena eating a still-living zebra- please spare me.  And the island with its lovely surprise?  Even though it may have been a figment of imagination, it was just a bit much. And, then, the ending failed terribly to redeem itself.  Not a book for me-sorry.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great film, and well done.<br /><br />For the life of me, I can't figure out why there was ever a controversy about this film.  Yes, lot's of use of the \\"N\\"; word.<br /><br />But this film was set front and center on the point in U.S. history when slavery was considered legal, and blacks were property.  Yes, a disgusting part of U.S. history... and yes, \\"ni**er\\" was widely used during that time.<br /><br />Maybe the uproar was from whites that found it objectionable to use the \\"N\\" word... because that part of history, and seeing what that looked like on film, makes most humans uncomfortable.<br /><br />But... you can't make past history go away just because it makes you uncomfortable.  Besides, this movie isn't all about that... it is set in the period, and is kitschy and fun... and has a great angle on the age old tension between Good and Evil.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Well, this one is heavy.  I would tell you if you are at all interested in the workings of the minds of troubled kids, or the parents who love them and are responsible for them, this is a book for you.  It does leave room for speculation as to the boy's involvement, which I appreciated. And the ending, is something I never saw coming.  That's all I can say without giving you too much.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This type of app is why I own a kindle.  Works as good as the windows app on my laptop and kindle beats laptop for quick tasks.
0843178450|5.0|I read these books when I was a little girl, now my girls love them.  I'm starting to buy the whole collection for them.  This was a great addition to it.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Silver Linings Playbook was better than I expected.  Although predictable, It was different, funny, unique all wrapped into one.  Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were great together.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a very comprehensive app.  Multiple translations of the Bible in one app, with easy switching between the translations!!! It's worth gold!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Once again this book was spell binding. Couldn't put it down. I was sorry to have the series come to an end.
B005F82X48|5.0|A Christian band not under a Christian label. I like their calling to not be under a Christian label to spread their music to the secular world.  The album is very good.  With songs ranging from pop to emo to goth-pop.  Talented musicians, talented singer.  Fans of Paramore may find a quick liking to this album.
B00C0NFMKI|1.0|Ok, don't get me wrong, I usually REALLY like Paramore's music.... but their new album is EXTREMELY lackluster. They went from \\"uniquely beautiful and intense\\" to \\"trendy, repetitive, bubblegum nonsense\\". It's like you can almost hear the ringing sound of the band members cashing checks over the total of the 3 chords they play in every song on the album.<br /><br />Honestly, based on ALL of Paramore's previous albums, I REALLY expected more than what we're getting here.
B007B6T3K4|4.0|The new singer for Xandria sounds all-too much like Tarja from Nightwish.  This album is very good, maybe not &#34;Legendary&#34; status, but very good for the first album of an established band featuring a new singer.  I find this album much more appealing to my tastes than the older Xandria stuff.  Fans of Nightwish, Delain, etc should give this album a try.
B00594XOZU|2.0|just don't use i thought i would.  Not sure why i even down loaded it.  t might be for others
B00475AYJQ|3.0|I loved Name of the Wind.  The cultures, the characters, the magic system, everything came together into this great world that Rothfuss paints.  This book continues the interesting storytelling technique of story within a story.  Unfortunately, where I found NotW to be a fun adventure that drew me deeper into the world, I found this sequal to be more of a slog.  Sections of the book went on for too long without advancing the story.  I also found the development of Kvothe to change him from a sympathetic, underdog hero into a rather unlikeable brat.  I like that he is a quick learner and such, but to make him suddenly the best magician, the best fighter, the best musician, and god's gift to women was just kind of annoying.  I understand that maybe, since this is a story being told by his future self, it's just boasting - but that still didn't make it fun to read.  I still plan on reading the next book in the series, but I hope it delivers more answers and develops a protagonist that people actually want to read about.
B00AEBB9CS|1.0|I was really upset with this purchase. First of all, it was in a flimsy paper case and not in a plastic protector like every other DVD I ordered. It turns out that the CD was damaged and it skips a whole hour of the movie. Terrible, terrible purchase. A waste of $5
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|My son wanted this for his Kindle Fire. It downloaded and installed easy. He likes it a lot and wants the full version of it.
B00AFZ86BA|3.0|I first learned about this release via an announcement on Facebook.  Various online sources stated that Ratt Original Album Series (2013) contained remastered versions of the band's first five albums, [[ASIN:B001HADE00 Out Of The Cellar]] (1984), [[ASIN:B001AUKUS6 Invasion Of Your Privacy]] (1985), [[ASIN:B000002IJO Dancing Undercover]] (1986), [[ASIN:B001G9LV5M Reach For The Sky]] (1988), and [[ASIN:B000002IPR Detonator]] (1990).  Although I already owned all of these albums, based on them being remastered, I ordered the \\"boxed set\\", which consists of a cardboard outer box, housing the albums which are protected by cardboard sleeves that replicate the original album covers.<br /><br />Looking through the set, the word \\"remastered\\" is nowhere to be found.  Released and \\"marketed\\" by Rhino, the discs have a different look from the original Atlantic Records releases, but still have the Atlantic Records emblem.  Rather than reflecting a 2013 copyright, each CD has the original release date, and none of the albums contain any bonus tracks.  Informally comparing the sound of the \\"old\\" albums versus the \\"new\\" releases, I am unable to discern a significant difference or improvement, in audio quality.  I could be mistaken, but this set seems to be just a repackaging by Rhino, of the original Atlantic recordings.  While this set is a nice deal for those who do not have all the albums, for those like me who already owned them, it's disappointing to discover that I have scammed into a rebuy.<br /><br />Ratt is a band whose sound seemed to evolve from album to album, with a significant transition occurring on Reach For The Sky, which was slicker, cleaner, and more heavily produced than those preceding it.  I think that Ratt's first three albums, Dancing Undercover in particular, could have really benefitted from remastering, to achieve a bigger, fuller, more impactful sound.<br /><br />If you're a newcomer, looking to get hard and heavy into Ratt, this is a convenient way to do so.  In the mid-80's, Ratt was at the forefront of the LA metal scene, and these five albums, featuring the classic lineup of Steven Pearcy, Warren DiMartini, the late Robbin Crosby, Juan Croucier, and Bobby Blotzer, represent the band at the peak of their popularity.  As noted in the product description, this is an import item.  I purchased my copy at Amazon.UK for about $18.  Shipping was combined with items in my order, which probably added a dollar or so.<br /><br />If you already own the original Atlantic releases, there is little reason to look at this collection.  A surprising number of artists have had part of their catalog reissued under the \\"Original Album Series\\" banner, which pricewise are generally good deals.  Do a search, and you might be surprised how many bands and artists, from a variety of genres, appear.  I haven't done much research, but there is probably little or no remastered material involved in these compilations.so.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|My son wanted this on his Kindle Fire. It downloaded and installed easy. It had to download some extra stuff to run on his Kindle. It was easy too. He really likes this!
0307594165|4.0|The contents of this book were enlightening and true to Toni MOrrison's writing abilities. I did so enjoy reading it.
B001EIOOVS|5.0|Since everyone else has already discussed the storyline, its relevance and comments on acting. I will only focus on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.  I do have the Standard Def 2 disc version but this is not a side by side comparison.<br /><br />At first, when I looked at the Blu Ray cover, I got worried as I , initially, didn't see where it listed it as having both the theatrical and extended versions.  Oops, did I make an error in my purchase?  Nope, the Blu Ray does contain both versions and I watched only the extended version for which this review is based upon.<br /><br />VIDEO...The transfer is very clean with no artifacting or disturbing grain.  The standard def DVD was also pretty darn good so I doubt if this is a remaster but it is an upgrade never the less with greater contrast.  There was no stair stepping in any scene as you might expect from the wide angle shots of traffic and trains.  The colors are fairly desaturated and muted so there nothing that will pop out at you video-wise.  Just expect a beautiful transfer appropriate to what the director was looking for.  The muted colors matched the often bleak landscape of the Bronx.  I was born there and remember it well.  Mbps rate averages in the low 20's but, never the less, the video is as clean a transfer as it needs to be.<br /><br />AUDEO...In many ways, the audio is the star of the Blu Ray presentation.  The disc defaults to a lossless DTS HD 5.1 and the sound editors were given full liberty, I assume, to do a masterful job of audio steering.  There are a great many pans between the front and rear sound stages when appropriate as well as a plentiful and enveloping soundscape throughout the film.  The directional use of the rear and front side speakers come in to use very often as needed and this discreet channeling of audio really made the film come alive for me.  That the audio is lossless only makes for more transparent and realistic sound as it does here.  It can be easy to lose awareness of the full home theater's use but I am always conscious of well done audio as The American Gangster on Blu Ray does.<br /><br />Extras...A couple of deleted scenes, an alternate opening and pretty much all the extras found on the original Standard Def release.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions. I hope that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.of the full home theater's use but I am always conscious of well done audio as The American Gangster on Blu Ray does.<br /><br />Extras...A couple of deleted scenes, an alternate opening and pretty much all the extras found on the original Standard Def release.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions.

B009JZXA0O|5.0|I own all the books and dvds of this series!  I absolutely love all the books, and the movies are very well done.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book was a good book because it helps children, adults,and etc.<br />I picked this rating because this book helps kids ans adults find words and Definitionen they dont know.<br />This book is very popular brcause u can always use it if there is no internet Service. I really enjoyed this book no matter what or were im at this book will be at the top of the list.
B0095P33IW|4.0|great, just like the comic book, loved the action the story line even the comedy it all kept me glued to the set.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this game.  It's great. Why do I have to write words, this is silly to rate with....
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me how, with each movie they are just as exciting as the first.  All the twist in plots.
B003204MQS|1.0|stupid story about the Devil wasting it's time and bothering to play some weak silly games with a couple. A movie like Exorcist 3 blows this out of the water. Majorly overrated, no content, no plot, filmed like a total noob too.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Everyone who sings on this show does an incredible job!  T-bone Burnett, as the music producer on the show, has found a perfect balance.
B004XVMCMQ|4.0|I've only read the book once and have looked at this movie twice - the last time recently.  The first part of the movie is so depressing that you just want to turn it off and go on to something more digestible.  After she goes to Mansfield Park it gets a lot more interesting and seems to progress nicely from there. Although this Fanny may not be exactly what Jane Austen presented I like her very much. All the characters are attractive. Even the man that Fannie refuses after leading around by the nose for a while seems to not be such a bad fellow - just unable to resist temptation after being disappointed in love. Question?  If he had been accepted by Fannie and was married to her would his behavior have been any different - probably not. The unbelievable part is that Fanny goes back to her horrible home and seems very content there - impossible and unbelievable. She only goes back to Mansfield Park when summoned.  Question? Is the father(Edward's father) a lecher who longs to get his own hands on Fanny? He seems to be two absolutely different people - confusing but interesting. Is Miss Crawford entirely too helpful to Fanny removing her wet clothing? There are several twists and turns in the story that keep one interested. I recommend it as a \\"movie\\" not necessarily a good adaptation of the Jane Austen story. The most moving thing in the whole movie is when Fanny's mother says \\"I married for love\\" and leaves Fanny to realize how badly that turned out which may influence her own decision. My favorite scene is when Edward finally \\"gets a clue\\" of what Miss Crawford is really like and tells her off right then and there.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Love the game - I play it myself.  The music/sounds are really relaxing.  Only prob I have had is that the game keeps timing out and has to reboot - the other night it wasn't even raking up the points as I played.  Discouraging as I was trying to get enough sand dollars to buy something new for my reef.  Haven't played again since then.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|As a child I grew up watching Star Trek and idolized the characters Capt. Kirk, Spock etc. Wasn't sure if this movie would do justice to the Original Star Trek. But after watching it with my kids this movie is even better than the original Star Trek movies. Perhaps the best Star Trek movie so far.<br />Downloading from amazon was a bit disappointing. The movie would pause in between and wait for download. We have high speed Internet and Netflix works just fine. Seems like Amazon servers must be loaded on Saturday night.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My grandson has been playing this since he was 1 - sits in my lap and I use his finger.  He loves it cause of course everyone is interested in technology.  He likes that the colors move and it is bright.
B0032KPE0G|4.0|This movie wasn't a life-changer, but it certainly was well made and entertaining. I would recommend it if you haven't seen it!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Really great story told from the child's point of view.  His Mom was very inventive in keeping him happy and satisfied with their world in 'Room'.  Must read
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Was very different but I enjoyed it.  I think almost anyone would like this movie if they will watch long enough to get into it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. It was our book club selection and I've finished it WAY before our book club will meet - may even go back and read it a second time. The story, although fiction, is based on events that did occur during that time period. Haunting. Character development is great. I highly recommend it.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|This was one of the most boring movies I've seen for a long time.  Was glad I rented it and didn't spend the money to attend the show downtown.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|The talent of this group is phenomenal. Congrats to them on their success and doing it all on their own.
1416972242|4.0|Great book so far. Engaging and easy for the age group it's geared to. Seems slightly scary for younger readers.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Loved this series! Entertaining, creative and great story line. Hope it stays around for a few more seasons at least. This was fun to watch.
B007EB3JTW|3.0|This item came in new condition but it took a month to get the book. This was my favorite book as a kid and I am giving it to my niece for her to have and love also. The only thing I didn't like was how long it took to get the book but I was in contact with the seller and they where really great about mailing me a new one when the first one never arrived.
B00009AOBI|5.0|brings back memories. introducing kids to our generation of movies. delivered fast, watching by the weekend. no issues. will order more
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|love the game it keeps you entertatined but after your free trial is over , the game is too much to buy
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read all of her books and can truly say I have never been disappointed, and Daddy's Gone A Hunting does not disappoint.  Thank you, Mary Higgins Clark!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|luv this game , it keeped me entertained , and it lasted a long time , i would purchase another game from them
B00004W510|4.0|Good compilation of the Band's hits and others.  Good quality of the tracks too!  Recommended for fans of The Band.
B009OYSFDM|3.0|I watched the first episode and I was entertained.  Its a bit much more Bruce Wayne than Oliver Queen but thats not always a bad thing.  Unsure of where the season will go from here - but I'm interested to find out.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Very, very entertaining game. I love mindless games with no skill or stress involved... This game is easy, without being boring.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|That never settles on one specific genre, that flows and bends and twists and keeps the listener engaged start to finish.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|Here is a great package deal with Alice n Chains. This has videos I have never seen and much  more cool stuff.
0385341008|2.0|the only thing this book did for me  was to make me investigate some details of the war . I would have like to have read more about the culture and not so much about the relationship  of the  author and  Sydney.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Love this series, but the sound was a little distorted in this season--kind of a vibration at times. Annoying but it didn't cause any serious distraction to the story.
0345803485|3.0|Wanted to see what the hoop-la was about. Kinda of boring, but I need to read more of the book to really make judgement.
B000OVLINI|5.0|A love a good mystery and was not disappointed!! This book was an amazing story, mystery all wrapped in one. It starts with a boy of 11 who goes to cymetery of forgotten books and finds one that everyone has been looking for for years. This book and its author leads this little boy through an amazing adventure lasting into adulthood. I didnt want to finish it. The whole bookclub felt the same way. If you wnat a good book to get lost in for a while then get this one. I promise you will not be disappointed!!!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I have been debating getting anything like this for some time I have heard the best possible reviews from friends and family and the internet but I still had no idea what to expect.  That is why I had so much fun with these games if you will interactive art bla bla bla it's still a game and your mom who does not play games now will still not play this one sorry. But she will not get mad at you for playing,yelling screaming . And she won't tell you to stop. This is a game that you pick up and play and then just put down and move on with the day. The  complete set of games you get are fun and worth a try if you can't get this pack you can jump onto psn and buy them separate for less $ try at least once if you don't like it let me know
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Lo e it.. looks justlike a. alarm.clo k. acts lima good one. loud.<br /> it is the only tonne I use daily.<br /><br />i
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|HP 2 is a great conclusion to the series.  The Amazopn price was excellent.  Movie arrived on time and we've watched several times.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Lois McMaster Bujold is as magnificent as always in this most recent Vorkosigan saga.  Would that she wanted to write a dozen more, either sequels, featuring Miles' children, or prequels of Aral's father and his adventures.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|He's my favorite and it is great to have new music from him.  All Bowie fans will enjoy! Love it!
B005FSI1IK|5.0|I corresponded a couple of times with Lois McMaster Bujold in the 1980s when I was writing romance novels.  I would read her Vorkosigan series in between my own writing and I loved them from the first sentence, back when she was writing for Analog.  I've read the entire series a couple of dozen times since then.  It never gets old.  It's like visiting old and well loved friends.  I call it comfort reading.
B002RTBN9O|5.0|Either you have it or you don't. You can't but either. Ayn Rand has a way of cutting to the core of human nature. If you like sugar coating you will hate this movie and the book, if not, you will enjoy this story immensely.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am already a Walking Dead fan but the price on here was great and the quality was good also. I like my new video library now because it's cheaper than cable and saves room because there is no dvd's or bluerays to store.
B00CHI5B7A|1.0|This movie was a complete waste of everyone's time and money; I only wish I could get back the minutes I spent on it!
0062073281|5.0|Was a bit slow at first but now I can't wait for the next one in June this year. I have read all the LA Candy series and LOVED them
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My son LOVES this game. We originally downloaded the free version but ended up spending the $2 to unlock all 15 puzzles. The puzzles are challenging enough my son stays engaged but not so difficult he gets frustrated and gives up. Great graphics and the 'celebration' when he successfully completes a puzzles is fun.
0425252868|5.0|This book is more than a story about the two pilot's encouters during WWII. It gave a me a r<br />espect for pilots on both sides of the battle. Their demostration of honor and chivalry was  quite enlightening. I was also surprised to learn of the German airmens distrust and dislike for the Nazi party and it's leaders. Could'nt put it down.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|I am a music lover, but have to admit I haven't taken the time to seek out this type of music before. The vast majority of the music I listen to are popular songs by popular artists. I have often been moved by music, but always because I can relate to the lyrics. Listening to The Piano Guys is the first time I have had a powerful emotional reaction to the music alone. Ever since I discovered these amazing musicians, their music has occupied the majority of my playlists. I could fill the page with superlatives and it wouldn't begin to quantify the quality and emotion The Piano Guys put into their music.<br /><br />Be sure to check out their videos on youtube to get a better understanding of the passion they put into their music.
B00669MFA2|4.0|Although it could not have the depth of character development that the book did, the movie did a fairly good job following the storyline.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|If all history was taught with stories like this there would be more students of history.  Great story and cannot wait for the next installment.
193700788X|1.0|I have been a huge SVM series. I have been so disappointed in this series since book 8. I was worried how she was going to end this book, and I was very correct in being scared.<br />**Spoilers**<br />She ended the relationship between Eric and Sookie in a very weak manner. I can't believe Eric would have given up on Sookie so easily and marry the Queen. Eric was very distant and so uncharacteristic. Sookie was needy in this book and could not hold her own ground. The fact that she used the cluviel in the previous book to save SAM was a big indicator that she was planning something between Sam and Sookie. The villains in this book were random. I wish I didn't buy this book for my Kindle app, because then i would have totally returned the book for my Refund.<br /><br />Charliane Harris has cheated us SVM fans. The writing in the last few books have been \\"lazy.\\"<br /><br />The plot to this book was not concrete. Seriously Amelia's dad hated Sookie because he wanted the cluviel for himself. Really? That was a weak plot. The devil making a pact with this Tyrese and Amelia's dad was so dumb.<br /><br />Sookie having sex with Sam was such a slutty thing to do. I saw it coming, but it surprised me that Sookie slept with him so quickly. I am so not reading anything Charliane Harris writes. I am not a fan anymore. I was so upset on how she ended Eric's character. I made you Rich Charliane and the least you could do is make us fans happy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is great for a free app, and it always runs smoothly!  Definitely recommend if you are a fan of solitaire.
0061478784|5.0|It arrived when expected and the packaging was good. But this book is absolutely amazing, curious, and beautifully surprising. With having been an avid fan of the adaptation by Miyazaki, I found the novel ever more worthy of my love!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a cute and simple game .  its easy for children to play.  I like how you don't have to buy gems just to play the game
B000FA675C|5.0|The ongoing adventures of Prof. Robert Langdon, traveling through Europe, to decipher the secrets of The Da Vinci Code. Excellent read!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just loved this series and  then it disappeared from tv~ couldn't even find the reruns...so it was great to be able to see and enjoy this again !!!!
B003ZHVJFA|3.0|Well, I've got to start this review by saying that this movie is a total guilty pleasure.  Tekken certainly isn't a good movie and it is by no means the film adaptation of the hit video game series that Tekken fans everywhere would have loved to see.  Fighting games are known for having convoluted and awkward storylines and its nice to see that they didn't really bother with that here.  Beyond having the basics of the Mishima-Kazama clan down and how they're all related to each other, the movie doesn't take a whole lot from the games.  The people who made the film evidently at least watched footage of the series however, since they seem to realize its all about fighting.<br /><br />Aesthetically, the movie has a lot in common with the dystopian sci-fi flicks of the late 80s and early 90s and like movies with names like Escape From New York, the quality of the acting is about the same.  There's some competence from the leads but the supports and backups are all dreadful.  Tekken is by no means oscar-worthy material but if you are able to divorce it from the inconsistencies with the story in the game franchise, it is a pretty decent popcorn flick.  The film quality is excellent and some of the fights are very good.  The film doesn't demonstrate a lot of real world logic and I'm not sure if that's because they couldn't be bothered to write good dialogue or if they realized the dialogue was just filler in between the fight scenes but either way there's a lot of (usually unintentional) humor in between the fight scenes.  I was definitely entertained by the movie however.  I'd give it a solid thumbs up to anyone who is into cheese and over-the-top action with a touch of overacting.  If you're a serious fan of the game franchise however, it's probably a solid avoid since they definitely didn't bother to familiarize themselves with the actual storyline from the games.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I bought this as a replacement. Love it. This movie will stand the test of time. Bring joy to all.
0439023521|5.0|at first i was a little sketical about this book... one was because im a twilight fan and the other is because i saw the movie and didnt like it that much.. but after a while i decide to buy the book and it is awesome... twilight sucks now and this is the best!!!! cant wait to buy the others!!!
B00063F8B2|5.0|I bought this as a replacement book to one we already had and love so much. It is great, still.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|great movie for young and old.  the first copy we received was no good but we returned it and the second one was fine
B006M4F67A|1.0|This version marks Tiles unplayable that most other Mahjong solitaire games would mark as available to play.  Particularly noticeable in the classic level, where the tiles on the second level on the top and bottom of the pyramid are not playable, even though the edges are visibly unblocked.<br /><br />Requires a good chunk of memory, and isn't moveable to SD storage, so make sure you've got plenty of internal storage (28MB+ the last time I checked).
1455502758|5.0|Hitchens wrote about what mattered most to him and blessed with immense talent, a good roster of meaningful contacts, and being of right time and place which awarded a rich career as the kind of writer that got read. Apparently Hitchens was ignitor of passion both positive and negative. I love a writer that goes well beyond what people want to hear. Drag it all out into the open. What are we saving it for?<br /><br />Mortality, written just prior to his death in 2011 and not entirely finished, chronicles eighteen months of Hitchen's battle with stage four esophageal cancer. With both laser precision and an intelligence far superior than most could even hope for plus a courage that extends past the very definition, Hitchens stays in the game right to the very end which lends hope to the belief that even in the face of the worst thing you can imagine, you can still be open and honest, sharp, and relevant. Pulling no punches, Hitchens give his account of the indignities of this disease while picking up the guantlet thrown down by his critics, and proving once again their ignorance while unjustifiably moving forward on his journey. His wife picks up where he left off and ends the book on a bittersweet note.<br /><br />Though not a fan of the memoirian genre, I do intend to read Hitch-22.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|I like the movie did not watch at theaters but glad I bought it. The story was different but OK.
B0006ZFQN0|5.0|This CD performs a perfect harmony between those 'Triple' and conductor that we expect from this Concerto really. It is so wonderful that we can feel warm and harmonious dialogue among them. It is so vivid.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|A cleverly done series with engaging characters and rich dystopian world that hooks you in right away.  A perfect read for fans of The Hunger Games trilogy or for those who enjoy an exciting read.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Well I have to admit long about book 3 I thought Sookie would be better off if she just admitted that she loved Sam and they got together.<br /><br />But then again we wouldn't have met some of the great characters that Charlaine gave us. I think she could create another series just by following up on some of the shifters and vampires we met along the way.<br /><br />I was fairly satisfied with the way she ended the series. I just hope that the dummies who write True Blood will end in the same way.
044024630X|4.0|Or so go the pounding sentences in this 16th iteration of the Jack Reacher saga, my first exposure. Lee Childs has a huge fan base in a series dominated by the indomitable perfect post 9/11 man's man and perhaps  every woman's fantasy. As in all such crime thrillers, Jack Reacher is a quick thinking man of action, who acts decisively when necessary as judge, jury, and executioner. For example, he relishes the prospect of taking on a group of six thugs single handily and without a gun. He, of course, also solves crimes that stymie mere mortals. A sense of social justice and an obligatory romance is included in the package.<br /><br />None of the above is a criticism, but a way to point out that Lee Childs is a master of this genre. Such books all feature short declarative sentence, taut fast paced action, and a clever ending. I especially enjoyed the role the midnight train plays throughout the novel. A clue: train tracks are  shown on the cover.<br /><br />Whether you intend to make a steady diet of this series, you will read this one straight through.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|Its ok i just couldnt get into this book. I would suggest it to people that can read these kind of books they will find it much better
B00CFEJGO0|4.0|Will is suspicious already. Ms Newsy is the dangerous one, and sure to be on the menu. Hannibal is a cunning pervert who considers himself a courtesan of fine arts.  Who knows which way the wind will blow this new young woman who was so ill fortuned to be born to her depraved father.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Everybody has been saying how good this book is, but it's extremely mediocre. It's more been there done that..... So yeah.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This is pretty dang cute so far! I just wish the friend thing would stay linked properly. Trying to connect to friends on Facebook, but it doesn't seem to want to stay connected. Still, I'm loving it. PONIES!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a great game considering its free. it has been so much fun when I'm on the go. it keeps me and my brother busy so we don't drive our parents nuts!!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I've been searching for something to replace Google reader since it will be discontinued (not happy about that). So far I've tried Feedly and a web-based service and found that the recent upgrades to Feedly have made it very user friendly and can be used very much like Google reader. I use it on my Kindle Fire and it works great. The web service required me to login every time which was a hassle to no end. Feedly has been flawless on my Kindle, Iphone, and laptop browser (Chrome). Check the list of options for users migrating from Google reader, and it will get you close to the same experience if that is what you are looking for. If not, the default options give a good user experience as well.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I´ll admit I bought this book because I am a HUGE fan of the &#34;Bones&#34; series.  A warning to Bones lovers: The book series is different!  It´s set in Canada, there is no Booth (his equivalent is detective Andrew Ryan), and Bones herself is a bit older than on TV.  HOWEVER, it´s still highly entertaining!<br />Temperance Brennan is called to investigate the death of a baby, but from there the story unfolds into many more layers of conspiracy and plotting.  I don´t want to give anything away, but this story goes much further than the case of three dead infants that they find hidden in an apartment.  The story takes Brennan from Montreal into the northwest of Canada.  Towards the end, it begins to get a bit technical and lost me... but it´s clear that everything was well-researched and it´s usually well-explained.  I´d definitely recommend it, as long as you´re not looking for a repeat of a &#34;Bones&#34; episode
B00A1XOPE8|2.0|This is yet another short Novella of my favorite author. It takes a single idea and runs with it. The idea of taking objects and rewriting their histories...Imagine your mom yelling \\"Lincoln your room is a disaster\\" You take the magic of this book and rewrite the history of your room so its spotless. This book asks the question if you can change the history of an object can you do the same with a soul. I did not get the vibe that Sanderson was trying to ask some moral question here just going hog wild with a cool magical idea. I wonder what goes on in his head when he thinks up magics that dont have any logic in them at all...he always bases them in something that is why even when its illogical to rewrite the history of an object is illogical he explains it to you so you are ok with it. I only gave this book two stars...it was slowish and I anticipated this title mainly because it takes place in the universe of \\"Elantris\\" another Brandon Sanderson book but the crossover was not there as I anticipated and the story dragged. I became more interested in the main character fixing up her surroundings instead of escaping from peril. Not a bad book just not a good book.
0545265355|5.0|This is one of those stories that makes you sit up all night long until you can't keep your eyes open any longer.  I literally fell asleep with the book on my chest.  I'm not surprised this was made into a movie.  From beginning to end, it was well-written, action-packed, and heart-wrenching.  The characters' dynamic was perfect.  They played off of each other so well, they seemed like real people.  I guess that's how I would describe this trilogy -- real.  It had a very real quality to it probably because of its similarity to the survivor shows on TV.  The only beef I have with this trilogy is the repetition.  It seems to be always the same thing in each book -- Katniss and Peeta go into the Hunger Games.  They try to save each other.  They both end up surviving after a boatload of hardship.  Other than that, this was an excellent story and comes highly recommended.
B003K16P3M|3.0|I liked this book but it could of been so much more. Katsa has issues she is a brooding volcano that everyone is afraid to set off because when Katsa gets upset for any reason she hurts and kills. Obviously she has no friends although she seems to have several from her council that she set up...How do you go around establishing a council in all seven kingdoms that undermines the government as a whole. Yes for the good but in my book that is out right treason.<br /><br />The characters are not fleshed out enough for me. Katsa is a loner...Po has power that allows him to do really cool stuff but we dont really get to know him that well. Is Randa really that much of a wuss so that when Katsa walks out on him he simply does not try anything? Yes Katsa's awesome and any attempt to chase her would be foolish but wouldn't it be fun to see Katsa show Randa's men a thing or two? Bad writing. Get away from Leck Get away from Leck Get away from Leck...Oh crap he is waiting for you...throw a dagger end of Leck....What?<br /><br />I suppose I am accustomed to reading adult novels with depth. The characters even discuss Leck after his death and say wow wasn't Leck a bad guy, or at least crazy. Yeah I guess who knows he is dead now so La La La La.<br /><br />Oh and by the way your king is dead and this ten year old girl is your queen everyone bow.<br /><br />Its a fun story. Its got adventure, fighting, conspiracy...but it lacks depth. Maybe I am being to harsh...I just see tons of avenues that this book could go and the author does not even breath a whisper or hint into other things going on in this world.<br /><br />Maybe its a reflection of the self absorbed main character that she never notices anything else going on in the world. There are two more books not sure if I will read them..although there is more to had because everything about this first book screams shallow.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|A-OK - I prefer using the electrical wall outlet as opposed to using my computer,  I just like it better this way
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|An easy and enjoyable read. Some of the sentences were short and choppy, but it still flowed well. And there were things that he just got wrong, but those are typical Hollywood errors that can be overlooked.
B008JFUO36|1.0|I am not going to avoid spoilers.  This movie has some very basic flaws.  No. 1 is that the advertising presents this movie as a thriller when in truth it is more about a BADLY written romance.  Second, we have yet another extremely advanced alien species who are able to blow up the moon, create fully automated flying battle droids, track a specific human through the desert from a distance at high speed by his DNA, mass clone humans and travel interstellar space, and yet they can't run an effective check point, a check point that fails to identify a 6'2\\" 220 lbs 70 year old black man is not a 5'6\\" 100 lbs 27 year old woman OR that that man is carrying a major explosive.  If you can't see the re-hashed Independence Day story yet, get this:  This advanced alien race has also missed the importance of a decentralized structure so that one bomb carried to one poorly protected central point kills all the bad aliens.  AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE WORST PART . . .<br /><br />The worst part is the romance story:  Woman loves man; they go into space; encounter evil aliens; aliens leave woman in hibernation but clone the man about 10 billion times and use him as their invasion troops.  Then, post invasion aliens set up an elaborate monitoring system using the clones of the male and clones of another female.  Note that this monitoring system is, given the alien technology, is completely unnecessary and inefficient.  In spite of that the aliens go the extra step to create false memories in those clones so each grouping of a male and female clone will believe themselves to be a couple.  The reasons the aliens put in all this extra effort on the theory that that will make the clones function more efficiently (ALL OF WHICH IS DONE SO THE ALIENS CAN TAKE EARTH'S HYDROGEN- WHICH IS THE MOST COMMON ELEMENT IN THE UNIVERSE AND IS READILY AVAILABLE TO CREATURES WITH THE ALIEN'S TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT THE WASTE OF A WAR ON EARTH!!!)<br /><br />It is never explained how this elaborate clone couplesystem is more efficient than just letting the drones do everything but that doesn't matter- back to the romance.  Surviving humans come up with a way to revive original love of clone man.  Clone man #42 encounters original woman, falls back in love with her.  WOMAN FALLS IN LOVE WITH CLONE EVEN THOUGH SHE KNOWS HE IS JUST ONE OF 10 BILLION COPIES.  Clone man 42 dies but not before impregnating woman.  Three years pass.  Clone man #75462 (let's say) finds woman with child and, of course, they fall in love again.<br /><br />So, this entire movie was essentially the story of how one clone is as good as any other.  IT TRULY SUCKED.
B008HJIN3C|5.0|Dude!!! Seriously love this movie.  It was packaged well and got to me in mint condition.  Very very well done

B005LAII62|4.0|PARANORMAN has caused a certain degree of controversy among parents in search of children's fare, so you should know upfront that this is not a movie that pre-schoolers will take kindly.  Young children are likely to find it too frightening and the references obscure.  It's really more of a pre-teen-and-up sort of flick.  That said, it's a fun, unpretentious little movie with some of the best stop-motion animation I've seen in a long time, and while I wouldn't put it in the same league as THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, I wouldn't mind seeing a couple of times more.<br /><br />The story focuses on bullying, a deservedly hot topic.  Norman Babcock is your average kid except for one thing: he can see and talk to dead people.  His mother attempts to be understanding a new-agey sort of way; his father is in explosive disbelief; his teen-age, cell-phone-addicted sister Courtney finds the whole thing embarassing.  But there is one person who believes him: his peculiar Uncle Prederghast, who believes it because he can do it himself.  For most of life Uncle Prederghast has been guarding a secret, and it has something to do with the town's history, which includes an unsavory story of a dangerous witch, a curse, and the living dead.  But Uncle Prederghast is getting old, and he's eager to pass on responsibility to Norman.<br /><br />Throughout the film characters bully each other frequently--but then find themselves in the wrong, and most often discover their bullying is based on a fear of what they do not understand.  Of particular interest is the notion that bullying is something that is passed along: you bully me, I bully the next kid, and so on.  This being a movie (as opposed to real life), all the characters (including zombies and the evil witch) learn to break the cycle.  Along the way we have references to SCOOBY-DOOBY-DOO (those meddling kids!), MARS ATTACKS (the scurrying hand), HALLOWEEN (cell phone music), and FRIDAY THE 13TH (hockey mask.)  A lot of the fun of the film is in recognizing these, so \\"movie nerds\\" are likely to enjoy it more than others will.<br /><br />The movie was originally released in 3D on the big screen, and I suspect it played better in that format than it does on DVD.  Whatever the case, the DVD comes with several entertaining extras.

B009JZTOG8|5.0|Can't wait for next season to begin.  Each episode kept my interest.  I love they way the present was tied into the past.
B005S9EJ14|2.0|I ran the DVD the other night and it stuck at about 3/4 of the way. There was a long pause then it moved forward. Not sure if I lost a scene or two. When I received the package, the DVD disc was rattling inside. Not sure if the disc is damaged at this point. Will try to replay.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It is EXTREMELY fun,but I'm on like level 20something,I think 24,anyway,it's like lagging a lot,and when I collect money from the dinosaurs or buildings,it crashes.I'm not sure if it's just temperay,or somethin.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The various seasons of the show deviate from the plot of the books here and there, but it's a very entertaining telling of the story!
1609613937|5.0|I have been on the diet recommended in this book for 18 months. Along with three workouts per week at the local YMCA I have lost 30 pounds and have significantly reduced medications required to control cholesterol. Life without meat and dairy and reduced oils will lead to a healthier future for those with a problem heart. Get started now!
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|I don't even know how to put into words just how fantastic this show is. The second episode one finished I rushed to watch the rest. Can't wait for more. NBC RENEW THIS SHOW.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I love sci-fi movies but only recently have I begun to read sci-fi. This was very very good!  Made me look at space travel in a new way. I'm amazed at how smart these people are to figure out how to sustain life in a totally foreign world.  I would recommend this book to sci-fi lovers and other like minded individuals.  There is alot of technical stuff and chemistry packed into this book, which I thought might bog me down because I HATE chemistry but it helped me see the practical side of it and I can admit it was interesting!!  Great read, highly recommend it!!
B002JCSWV6|4.0|I don't know about you but if Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman are in any movie, it's usually pretty good.  I thought they did well with their portrayal of such a sensative subject: Apartheid and what it took for Africa to deal with the aftermath of it all.  Because it wasn't just about a game of Rugby .....
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Iy was wonderful....I miss Julieann on Dancing With the Stars....but she did an amazing job acting in this movie!!! Such an entertaining way to spend a rainy/snowy day in Northern Michigan
B000P0J0A6|5.0|These little critters seem so harmless, you know?!?!  Then POW!, they can turn into little monsters!  Kind of makes you wonder about the people who write these type of books.  Pretty funny movie though.
B00BNXOMHA|3.0|The movies were fine.  However, the quality of one of the discs (Breaking Dawn 2) just freezes in random places.  The only way to unfreeze it is to unplug my blue ray player.  No other discs before or since have this problem, so it has to be just this disc.  I've tried it 3 times, and it still doesn't work right.  The other issue is that no matter what settings I use, all of these movies are sized to about 4 inches of black frame around them, so they will not play full screen on my 42-inch flat screen.  Again, other movies play just fine.  I must say that I am disappointed in the quality.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I bought this DVD because Les Miserables is one of my favorite movies.  I plan to watch it frequently - perhaps the entire family will watch it when we go on vacation to the beach.
B0088W6Y7K|5.0|Awesome show! It is sad it was canceled after this season. The show still had a lot of momentum left.
B009R659L8|4.0|I enjoyed the book but,It was not one of Clarke's best efforts.  I was a little disappointed with the story it did not have the usual twists & turns of her mystery novels
B0083EM24C|5.0|It took awhile...I wasn't sure about this album at first.  But now I listen to it at least a few times a week.  I listen to it at work and, uh, when I take walks.  It has really grown on me and I actually prefer it over Manners at this point.  Give this album some time, it gets better with age.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Not as much gore as some of Tarrantino's others - some, it's still Tarrantino, just not as &#34;eew&#34; inducing.  Foxx and Waltz were amazing, and Kerry Washington was great.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|I saw them at the Izod Center (Meadowlands) in New Jersey November of 2011 on this tour. The show was absolutely amazing! I was hoping that they would film a show for this tour. I can't wait for this to be released!

0812993845|3.0|On Mothers' Day I sat in my favorite chair reading most of the day. I finished \\"The Wedding Night,\\" by Sophie Kinsella. It was Kinsella's weakest novel to date, but it was still a fun diversion from the more mundane tasks of life. I didn't LOVE it the way I have loved almost all her other books, but I liked it enough to keep reading. I thought it was too long, and ridiculous, even by Kinsella's standards, where ridiculous is par for the course.<br />For once there were 2 story lines going on, one of each of two sisters. No need to describe the plot. If you know Kinsella, you know her books involve romance, cheeky heroines and happy endings. Enough said.
B00BMKDTNC|1.0|Boring descriptions of battle after battle. The only thing that kept me reading was that I wanted to finish the series.
B00COHIFQS|2.0|The wife and I watched this movie over the weekend. The trailer looked good and the movie got decent reviews. After watching it, I feel as though we wasted two hours of our lives that we can never get back.

0821221841|5.0|This book is written with a lot of clarity and really gets to the essence of how cameras work, how to compose photographs, and how to change the look of your photographs. Just what I expected in a book from a true master of his craft.

B00B7364H2|5.0|I ended my review of volume 1, [[ASIN:B005XBA9Y8 Mercury Living Presence Boxed Set]], with the words &#34;Now, when does volume 2 with 50 more come out?&#34; Well, it turns out to be 55, and here it is. For those who'd have inadvertently landed here from a long sojourn on planet Mars, let them be reminded that Mercury was a label established in 1945 at the end of the 78s era (a division of Mercury Radio and Television Corporation), first devoted to and famed for its catalog of popular music and jazz, but that branched out to classical at the end of the 1940s and became a prized audiophile series in the LP era under its moniker &#34;Living Presence&#34; and under the aegis of C. Robert Fine (sound engineer) and Wilma Cozart (producer) ; in fact the Fine-Cozart team worked so well together that they eventually became Mr and Mrs Fine, in 1957. Others were involved too, as David Hall the producer of the early releases, Harold Lawrence, producer of the late releases, Robert Eberenz, Fine's erstwhile associate engineer who became sole in charge starting in 1964, and George Piros, in charge of the delicate processing of the master tapes onto state-of-the-art LPs. I urge anybody interested in knowing what kind or recording techniques made the Mercury Living Presence recordings so special to go read the Wikipedia entry on Mercury Records, section &#34;Mercury Living Presence Series&#34;, and the stupendous online article, essay, paean, monument by Rudolf A. Bruil published on soundfountain, both of which they can complement with the online interview of Wilma Cozart Fine by Bruce Duffie from 1995 on kcstudio dot com and the 1999 interview of Robert Eberenz on opusklassiek. Don't miss, also, for the complete Mercury catalog, LPs and CDs, with all the cover photos, on mercury dot lacyway dot com, another jaw-dropping monument to the label.<br /><br />The Mercury Living Presence audiophile cachet was rejuvenated in the CD era, thanks to the careful and loving remasterings made in the years 1990 to 1995 by Wilma Cozart Fine (who passed away in 2009, aged 82), always based on the masters and using the restored &#34;original Mercury vacuum-type Westrex film recorder and Amex 3-track tape machine&#34;, with &#34;no equalization, filtering, compression or limiting&#34; (the few SACD releases were not done by Mrs Cozart Fine and did not use the restored equipment, but Revox machines). There were 136 CDs reissues (some in 2- or 3-CD sets), excluding two compilations of samples (&#34;You Are There!&#34; volume 1 & 2). Each CD usually reissued the content of one and a half LP, sometimes two, many compiled material from various LPs and recording sessions, always into very coherent and attractive programs, and most were filled to the brim. Volume 1 and now volume 2 collect those original CDs as they were, e.g. with no reshuffling of content. I have too many of the individual releases to justify buying the compilation sets, but from reviews and comments of the previous one, it appears that it came with only limited information about precise dating of the recordings and the technical info provided in the booklets of the individual CDs (and none of the original liner notes). Not so with the new issue: it offers a great booklet (I was able to consult it), with the detailed technical information about dates, personnel and microphones, a long essay of Mike Gray on the history of &#34;Living Presence&#34; with loads of more fascinating technical info, followed by an article reprinted from the July/August 2012 issue of TapeOp by Thomas Fine, the son of Robert and Wilma, and on top of that dozens after dozens of great photos.<br /><br />It would seem then that the new set needs no recommendation - no more than the previous one, seeing how fast it went -, just a detailed listing of its contents. But it turns out that the set offers a bonus, which calls for special and extensive comment, as it raises the issue of what it is that truly DEFINES &#34;Mercury Living Presence&#34;; for reasons of length and Amazon strictures I have sent it to the comments section.<br /><br />There are too many CDs for me to provide the product links to the original CD releases, but I've added the label numbers and ASIN numbers, which should make it easy to go to the entry of the original CD. The recording dates I provide are collated from various sources: the individual CDs when I have them, but also the mammoth Mercury discography compiled by Michel Ruppli and Ed Novitsky (volume IV has the chronological listing of the Mercury Living Presence classical records, [[ASIN:0313290342 The Mercury Labels: A Discography Volume IV The 1969-1991 Era and Classical Recordings (Discographies)]]), and the discography of the London Symphony Orchestra by Philip Stuart (it is now hosted on the website of CHARM, the Research Center for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music). I have found no discrepancy between Stuart and Ruppli/Novitsky; there are a few (but, except in a few cases, never more serious than a few days) between them and the dating provided on the CDs. In some cases where I've been able to check, the booklets were wrong and the Ruppli/Novitsky dating was right (no way Mercury could have been recording Paray's Auber Overtures in Detroit on April 4, 1959, AND Dorati's Petrouchka in Minneapolis. Ruppli/Novitsky's 20 April for the latter is confirmed by other sources), but in another case (Janis' Pictures at an Exhibition), it was the other way around.<br /><br />CD 1: Originally 432 006.

Hilde Somer, San Antonio SO, Victor Alessandro. 1:07:52<br /><br />The logic is clear: successively Dorati (not quite 20 CDs, since one is shared with Kubelik and one and a half has Fistoulari's Sylvia), Marcel Dupr&eacute; (1 disc), Fennell (9 CDs and thank God not just marches, marches and marches this time), Hanson (10 CDs), Kubelik (1 CD plus the half-one shared with Dorati), Paray (8 CDs), Puyana (3 CDs), Starker (1 CD). But here comes the throw-in. CD 54, Dorati again, and with only The Rite of Spring, for a stingy 31 minutes? And anyway Dorati's Minneapolis Rite was already on volume 1, so what's the deal here?<br /><br />Well here's the deal. On volume 1 was Dorati's stereo remake from 15 November 1959, here you get his mono recording from 12-14 December 1953.<br /><br />And then, CD 55: Corigliano's Piano Concerto and Strauss' Parergon, plus a 16-minute interview of Corigliano. Now THAT'S interesting, and quite a bonus too. Neither the early Dorati Rite nor the Corigliano/Strauss program were ever part of the batch of CDs reissued under the auspices of Wilma Cozart Fine in the early 1990s. THEY ARE NEW TO CD. As for the interview, it was never before issued commercially. The booklet indicates that it &#34;was originally released as a promotional LP by Mercury's marketing department&#34;.<br /><br />But the inclusion of the Corigliano/Strauss program, as exciting news as it is, also raises a load of questions. The recordings were made on May 19 & 20, 1969 and it is not clear that they legitimately belong to the &#34;Living Presence&#34; Series. For (much) more on that and the justification of this review's title, please go to the comments section, starting part II.<br /><br />A question that some readers and fans of Mercury might ask themselves: with these two volumes of reissues totaling 50+53 CDs (not counting the two new discs of the new set), which ones, among the Wilma Cozart Fine reissued CDs, are STILL left out?<br /><br />Well, more than a handful - which makes me hope that a volume 3 will eventually come out. The original CD reissue of Hanson's Merry Mount Suite, Mosaics and Piano Concerto (vol. 1 CD 8) came with a second CD of explanations by the composer, which wasn't included in the volume 1 compilation, and I guess this one will be left out forever. Which, from Mercury's original batch of 136, leaves 32 to go (135 - 50 - 53). For the complete list, see also the comments section (Part I).<br /><br />Now, 32 CDs would seem stingy compared to the 51 and 55 of the first two volumes. Does it mean that enough new remasterings and releases to fill out 20 more CDs are in store? I sure do hope so. The Living Presence catalog was fairly extensively covered by the Wilma Cozart Fine reissues, at least the stereo era, but even there, there were some frustrating omissions. As for the mono era, it was largely left untapped, even considering that it was relatively short (stereo recording began at the end of 1955) and that much was later re-made in stereo. Among the gold nuggets still to be mined: Kubelik's early Tchaikovsky, Brahms and Bloch with Chicago, Hanson's series of American music including symphonies of Barber, Harris, Cowell, Piston and his own 4th and 5th, Paray's mono and stereo Beethoven and Brahms' 4th from 1955 mono, Dorati's Beethoven Symphonies No. 4 & 8 from November 1955 (Mercury Living Presence's first recording in stereo, but apparently the stereo tapes are lost) and his 1957 &#34;Eroica&#34;, complete Tchaikovsky Sleeping Beauty (1955 mono), 1953 Copland 3rd Symphony, 1963 Schumann Fourth, his abundant Haydn (Symphony No. 45 &#34;Farewell&#34;, &#34;Fire&#34;-59, No. 81, 94 &#34;Surprise&#34;, 100 &#34;Miltary&#34;, 101 &#34;Clock&#34; and 103 &#34;Drumroll&#34; were recorded between 1957 and 1965). And add to all this a number of recordings not usually associated with Mercury but indeed recorded by Fine and the Mercury team and thus deserving inclusion (see the discussion in the comments section for more about this), like Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto with Szeryng and the LSO from July 1962 and Beethoven's Violin Concerto with the same and Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt from July 1965. There's also Josef Szigeti's final batch of recordings, made from 1959 to 1961, even if the once great violinist is only the painful shadow of himself. A number of these have already been reissued on CD, but in Japan only and they need to be made available in the West, preferably in transfers using Wilma Cozart Fine's restored Mercury machines. For a complete and I hope tantalizing list, see again the comments section, starting Part IV. Interviewed by Bruce Duffie in 1995, as she was still working on her program of reissues, to the question &#34;will there eventually be a time when everything in the original catalog is back out?&#34;, Wilma Cozart Fine said this: &#34;We're certainly aiming in that direction. We may run into trouble with certain ones due to deterioration or the condition of the tapes. The truth of the matter is, as with all recording projects we will release them as long as we have them and as long as the public wants them and buys them, then we will continue to go through the catalog.&#34;<br /><br />The success of volume 1 seems to give a clear answer to that, as should the success of volume 2. Indeed, potential buyer, act quick. When I published my review of vol. 1, it sold at a little less than 3 a disc. Now? More than 9 and trending to 10, no more a bargain - and you are lucky if it is sold at all: last time I checked (early March), no more offer on the French sister company,only one (and expensive) offer on the UK and German websites. For the latecomers, remains eBay and patience, or impatience and burglary at their local library.ikimora op. 63 (Eastman Philharmonia, Hanson 8 May 1962); Charles Martin Loeffler: Two Rapsodies (soloists Robert Sprenkle oboe, Francis Tursi viola, Armand Basile piano, 6 May 1958); Howard Hanson: Fantasy Variations on a Theme of Youth (soloist David Burge, 7 May 1956).

Hilde Somer, San Antonio SO, Victor Alessandro. 1:07:52  The logic is clear: successively Dorati (not quite 20 CDs, since one is shared with Kubelik and one and a half has Fistoulari's Sylvia), Marcel Dupré (1 disc), Fennell (9 CDs and thank God not just marches, marches and marches this time), Hanson (10 CDs), Kubelik (1 CD plus the half-one shared with Dorati), Paray (8 CDs), Puyana (3 CDs), Starker(1 CD). But here comes the throw-in. CD 54, Dorati again, and with only The Rite of Spring, for a stingy 31 minutes? And anyway Dorati's Minneapolis Rite was already on volume 1, so what's the deal here?  Well here's the deal. On volume 1 was Dorati's stereo remake from 15 November 1959, here you get his mono recording from 12-14 December 1953.  And then, CD 55: Corigliano's Piano Concerto and Strauss' Parergon, plus a 16-minute interview of Corigliano. Now THAT'S interesting, and quite a bonus too. Neither the early Dorati Rite nor the Corigliano/Strauss program were ever part of the batch of CDs reissued under the auspices of Wilma Cozart Fine in the early 1990s. THEY ARE NEW TO CD. As for the interview, it was never before issued commercially. The booklet indicates that it &#34;was originally released as a promotional LP by Mercury's marketing department&#34;.  But the inclusion of the Corigliano/Strauss program, as exciting news as it is, also raises a load of questions. The recordings were made on May 19 & 20, 1969 and it is not clear that they legitimately belong to the &#34;Living Presence&#34; Series. For (much) more on that and the justification of this review's title, please go to the comments section, starting part II.  A question that some readers and fans of Mercury might ask themselves: with these two volumes of reissues totaling 50+53 CDs (not counting the two new discs of the new set), which ones, among the Wilma Cozart Fine reissued CDs, are STILL left out?  Well, more than a handful - which makes me hope that a volume 3 will eventually come out. The original CD reissue of Hanson's Merry Mount Suite, Mosaics and Piano Concerto (vol. 1 CD 8) came with a second CD of explanations by the composer, which wasn't included in the volume 1 compilation, and I guess this one will be left out forever. Which, from Mercury's original batch of 136, leaves 32 to go (135 - 50 - 53). For the complete list, see also the comments section (Part I).  Now, 32 CDs wouldseem stingy compared to the 51 and 55 of the first two volumes. Does it mean that enough new remasterings and releases to fill out 20 more CDs are in store? I sure do hope so. The Living Presence catalog was fairly extensively covered by the Wilma Cozart Fine reissues, at least the stereo era, but even there, there were some frustrating omissions. As for the mono era, it was largely left untapped, even considering that it was relatively short (stereo recording began at the end of 1955) and that much was later re-made in stereo. Among the gold nuggets still to be mined: Kubelik's early Tchaikovsky, Brahms and Bloch with Chicago, Hanson's series of American music including symphonies of Barber, Harris, Cowell, Piston and his own 4th and 5th, Paray's mono and stereo Beethoven and Brahms' 4th from 1955 mono, Dorati's Beethoven Symphonies No. 4 & 8 from November 1955 (Mercury Living Presence's first recording in stereo, but apparently the stereo tapes are lost) and his 1957 &#34;Eroica&#34;, complete Tchaikovsky Sleeping Beauty (1955 mono), 1953 Copland 3rd Symphony, 1963 Schumann Fourth, his abundant Haydn (Symphony No. 45 &#34;Farewell&#34;, &#34;Fire&#34;-59, No. 81, 94 &#34;Surprise&#34;, 100 &#34;Miltary&#34;, 101 &#34;Clock&#34; and 103 &#34;Drumroll&#34; were recorded between 1957 and 1965). And add to all this a number of recordings not usually associated with Mercury but indeed recorded by Fine and the Mercury team and thus deserving inclusion (see the discussion in the comments section for more about this), like Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto with Szeryng and the LSO from July 1962 and Beethoven's Violin Concerto with the same and Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt from July 1965. There's also Josef Szigeti's final batch of recordings, made from 1959 to 1961, even if the once great violinist is only the painful shadow of himself. A number of these have already been reissued on CD, but in Japan only and they need to be made available in the West, preferably in transfers using Wilma Cozart Fine's restored Mercury machines. For a complete and I hope tantalizing list, see again the comments section, starting Part IV. Interviewed by Bruce Duffie in 1995, as she was still working on her program of reissues, to the question &#34;will there eventually be a time when everything in the original catalog is back out?&#34;, Wilma Cozart Fine said this: &#34;We're certainly aiming in that direction. We may run into trouble with certain ones due to deterioration or the condition of the tapes. The truth of the matter is, as with all recording projects we will release them as long as we have them and as long as the public wants them and buys them, then we will continue to go through the catalog.&#34;  The success of volume 1 seems to give a clear answer to that, as should the success of volume 2. Indeed, potential buyer, act quick. When I published my review of vol. 1, it sold at a little less than 3 a disc. Now? More than 9 and trending to 10, no more a bargain - and you are lucky if it is sold at all: last time I checked (early March), no more offer on the French sister company, only one (and expensive) offer on the UK and German websites. For the latecomers, remains eBay and patience, or impatience and burglary at their local library.

0385349947|5.0|I have absolutely nothing in common with Ms. Sandberg except being female.  I don't have kids, have never been super-ambitious, and don't even participate in social networking.  I could NEVER juggle children and a job like hers; it's exhausting just to read about it!  But I thought the book was interesting, thought-provoking,  well written, and a pleasure to read.  I also think a lot of the catty, sour grapes-type comments that some people are making (many of them women) are perfect examples of what Sandberg is talking about:  that women do not support each other, and in fact resent each other's success -- and that this holds us all back.
B005N0PJJO|4.0|I enjoy all three books in this series and I have read them again and again, but this is my least favourite.  I think it is just a little overworked on the angst.  Having said that, I still think this is a great author who writes great books
B006LSZECO|1.0|Just could not  get into it - I put the book down after the first few chapters. Was not for me!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is fun, quick and absorbing.  It is a good way to spend a few minutes flexing your solitaire muscles.

B00BF123WG|4.0|A little slow in the beginning but it picks up into a tense thriller 2nd half.  Lots of details, names, places , events but not totally necessary to keep track of them all to keep up with what is going on.  I liked Argo better however.  The sense of Zero Dark Thirty is a bit darker, more gritty , more edgy than Argo.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Love the game, very entertaining, and recommend buying on to the Neurax Worm for $0.99, moves quickly and is a very fun level, they will worship you, they will worship you...
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|Is it just me that the Blu Ray Concert Disc, especially the vocals, sounds \\"hissy\\" at loud vocal moments? I tried the disc on different sets of speakers with the same results. The musci sounds good, but the vocals muddy and hissy. I can't be the only one? Or am I?<br /><br />Otherwise great film.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|I wanted to be able to run as Dorothy, and the Scarecrow, and now it seems that the one guy is it.  If I could build into more characters I would give it 5 stars.

When I bought this I was amazed at how wonderful this was,  her voice is amazing and it's so unique.  The songs sound like mini pop opera's.  I don't remember the last time I enjoyed an album so much.  I have listened to it over and over and over and it has so many textures. The song Video Games is haunting as are many of the songs.

1451695195|1.0|I picked this book up expecting much, much more. Because it is written by a neuroscientist, I thought the content would be science-oriented. Wrong! Science was left at the door in this one; instead, we get a lot of subjective experiences written by an inarticulate guy who has no real ability to convey what he means. Result: boring dribble. This book was a snooze-fest!

B00COHAUD4|5.0|[[ASIN:B00COHAUD4 Mama]]  If you were looking for a bloody slasher with mindless, big breasted teenie boppers running thru the woods, this isn't that movie.<br />I just had to give this movie 5 stars.  Why?  Good understandable plot, well thought out with enough scarey twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat the entire movie.  The 2 little girls are incredible little actors and completely believable.  All characters gave great performances. To me there were no villians, but how can you make a movie without a bad guy. And so the ghost is made ugly and scarey and murderous.  If you think about the characters, their stories are truly heart-breaking.<br /><br />OK - A woman in an institution a lifetime or more ago, snatches/grabs her infant child from the nurse and makes a break for it.  She is chased by big angry men thru the woods to the edge of a cliff.  Her choice; let the men take her back to the institution and never see her child again or jump to her and her childs death.  She jumps.  Move forward to today.  A distraught father takes his 2 small daughters, one is little more than a baby, in his car from their home to somewhere up in the mountains. He is speeding down an icey road in a snowstorm. He is driving like a madman.  The girls are frightened and crying.  The oldest girl begs him to slow down.  The car skids, goes over an embankment and crashes into a tree.  He grabs the girls, dragging them thru the woods and finds an old abandoned cabin.  He is obviously crazy with grief.  Crying and distraught, he holds his one child and puts a gun to her head.  In the next moment he is savagely attacked by ??? the ghost?  Next you see the two little girls sitting on the floor of the cabin.  They are alone.  Who will ever find them.  How will they survive without heat, clothing, water, utilities and food, especially in the long cold winter.  Out of the darkness, rolling across the dusty floor comes a cherry.  It's a cherry the smallest girl exclaims.  -Goforward several years-  The girls Uncle had never given up hope of finding the girls.  He has spent all his money and has frustated his girlfriend in his obsession to find them.  Just has he has spent his last penny the girls are found.  They are little more than wild animals, but they are alive.  How could this be?  In the center of the cabin's main room is a waist high pile of cherry pits.  OK, a little far fetched, but stick with me on this one.  The Uncle is thrilled they are found and decides to take them to live with him.  The girlfriend is a free spirit (plays in a band tattoos and all) and is not thrilled with this.  And little do they know, but with the girls comes the ghost.  The grieving mother who jumped to her death.  Her body was found, but never the child's.  She had been searching for her child all those years when the distraught father came to the cabin in that area.  When she heard the children crying and pleading and saw that the children were in mortal danger, she stepped in and saved them.  She cared for them, played with them, fed them and protected them.  You come to understand that her love for the two girls replaced the love and loss of her child she had been searching for for so long.  But now others have taken these children from her too.  How the rest plays out will keep you guessing.  You fear for the children.  The adults at first have no clue.  When they each do get a clue, the ghost steps in. You never know what is coming next. The children are torn between the real world and the love of \\"Mama\\".  When you believe all hope is lost. The hero in the movie is the least likely.  It is a bitter/sad battle to the very end.  And just when you believe it IS the end, IT ISN'T!<br /><br />This is a really good movie.  Possibly the only really good \\"ghost\\" movie.  For that I give it 5 stars.
0143038583|5.0|This book is full of interesting information. For example, Pollan shows how portion sizes in fast foods have increased over the decades. It is much easier, for example, to get a customer to buy one newly-larger portion of fries than to get him/her to buy two equivalent erstwhile smaller portions.<br /><br />The author clarifies the matter of high-fructose corn syrup. Whether or not it is the same as sugar, in terms of effects on the body, is not the issue. The issue is the indiscriminate way it has been added to so many foods that had not been sweetened before.<br /><br />Pollan has a fascinating account of Joel Salatin and his traditional farm at Polyface, Virginia. The example of sustainable farming is essentially an enclosed ecosystem. The contrasts with agribusiness-based farms are along these lines: ecological, not industrial; perennial species, not annual species (such as corn); diverse crop species, not monoculture; solar energy, not fossil fuels; local market, not global market; local fertility, not imported fertility. Cows graze on pasture, and the locations are rotated so that the grass is not overeaten. Chickens engage in their natural habits of eaten larvae from cow pats. They are enclosed in a bottomless enclosure that is moved ten feet every day. That way, no grassy area is overwhelmed by the nitrogen from their feces.<br /><br />Finally, the author provides a series of websites. These describe where one can buy local, truly organic produce. (Otherwise, be careful because the term \\"organic\\" is a relatively amorphous term).

B00BGIBVRG|3.0|I am always disappointed when Hollywood portrays a movie as a comedy, but when one watches the movie discovers all of the funny parts were in the trailer.  This movie is more drama then comedy.  Too much foul language where it was not necessary ( I do not know any adults who talk like this).  This movie could have been really good.  Sad to see it was just so-so.

B005LAII62|3.0|The second half of 2012 saw four big name animated films released on the big screen.  One of them, Wreck-It Ralph, ran away at the box office and was loved by critics.  The other three, Frankenweenie, ParaNorman, and Hotel Transylvania, battled for second place.  All four films had great animation, good casting, a good blend of action, comedy, and drama, and a solid advertising campaign preceding their American releases.  All four films also had un-original origins in that they all drew heavily from prior animated blockbusters.  So why the sharp difference in performance?  The answer to this is key to understanding costumer choices, and the ability to distinguish oneself from their competitors.  Wreck-It Ralph stood out as it was the only film about video games, and featured an antihero in the lead role.  The other three films seemed eerily similar in that their plots delved into the world of the supernatural - horror fantasy genres, and featured child characters in the lead roles.  Frankenweenie is basically Frankenstein with a dog instead of a man, and a boy instead of a doctor.  ParaNorman was an animated remake of Sixth Sense blended with plot-lines from other horror films.  And Hotel Transylvania drew upon elements of multiple horror films.  Its as if most of Hollywood shared the same scripts and screenplays, but just changed up the casting and animation style.  This is unfortunate, as the latter three were solid films, and each would have performed much better  in the absence of the other two.<br /><br />Now my review for ParaNorman.  The plot line seems like a hybrid of Sixth Sense, and a multitude of films about witches, such as Lords of Salem.  The pace of the movie was fairly slow, with none of the manic action and snappy dialogue common to other animated films.  The soundtrack matched the pace of the movie.  The plot logic was sound, with great attention to detail.  The animation was believable though nothing spectacular.  There were some scary scenes inthe film that toddlers would probably get nightmares from, so I would not bring anyone under 5 to see this film.  Overall, a film that is above average, even borderline good.  Except when stacked up against the competitors that Hollywood put out last year, it failed to stand out...
B0064MPXFA|3.0|I really liked it starting out, but like most series it got worse instead of better.<br />Too many negative comments toward the right - it's fictional - did they really<br />needs to take stabs at Sarah Palin and others?  Seriously, Hollywood needs to<br />understand that half their population is Democrat and half is Republican<br />and just entertain and not do put-downs in their script!!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|As always, Mr. Archer never disappoints. This latest book is one of his best. And I can tell that there will be another one to follow.  I can barely wait.
0812993845|4.0|Wedding Night is another fabulous addition to Sophie Kinsella's chick lit novels. Before I start this review I just have to point out that I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella. She was the one that helped me through my high school years, by her ever hilarious books, from the Shopaholic series, Can You Keep a Secret? to Remember Me? Of course even her recent releases have become some of my favorite chick lits, specifically I've Got Your Number which I actually reviewed on this blog last year. You can imagine how excited I was to find out she has a new novel with her trademark protagonist and a laughter inducing plot. I can tell a Sophie Kinsella female protagonist a mile away. There is this unique trait I find in every one, they are british of course, always are the center of the most embarrassing situations but are still so endearing and very likable. Half of the time I tend to always yell \\"oh no! can't you see this is a DISASTROUS idea?\\" I mean if you haven't read her books, I'm pretty sure you at least watched the Shopaholic movie, so you must know what I mean.<br />Back to Wedding Night. What is different about this book is that it is actually told from two POVs, something Sophie Kinsella has never done before. I was, to be honest, a bit wary, especially since the second POV belongs to the main protagonist's older sister. I even started reading it back in february but stopped after 40 pages, excitement deflated and actually surrendering a little bit that I might actually end up not liking a Sophie Kinsella book.. something that is still unheard of. However when I picked it up again in March, I must say that I got sucked in after the initial slow start. What was funny is that in the end I enjoyed the POV of the older sister, Fliss, way more than the main protagonist, Lottie. Fliss was the level headed one of the two. Lottie got swept up in the unrealistic romance, getting proposed by a guy she hasn't seen for 15 years. The guy she had a romantic couple of weeks with in Ikonos, a greek island back when she was 18. Fliss tried warning her, and even started creating elaborate schemes to try and stop this sudden and crazy marriage. By this time I was more interested in Fliss and the sudden appearance of Lorcan, Ben's old friend. Lottie and Ben's relationship felt too rushed (obviously! Being married like that). Fliss on the other hand... I have to say Lorcan is the type of guy I crave for in Kinsella's books. The brooding, director of a big shot company with the 10 thousand dollar suits and serious, don't mess with me, face. He reminds me of both men from I've Got Your Number and Shopaholic, but is still his own man. He was a character I wanted to know more about and actually got to do just that. Fliss and Lorcan's scenes, especially with Richard, Lottie's ex-boyfriend, and Fliss's young son, Noah, who starts telling the most convoluted lies to people, such as him getting heart surgery among others that crack any readers up.<br />This wouldn't be a Sophie Kinsella novel without the fun and hilarious banter as well as the awkward and embarrassing situations. Fliss trying to keep Lottie and Ben from cashing in on their wedding night as well as trying to teach Noah that it is wrong to tell lies like that, especially when they come back and bite Fliss back in the butt. As for the writing, it was superb, I didn't expect any less from Sophie Kinsella. The ending was actually quite surprising but refreshing. That is what I like about Sophie Kinsella, she takes overused chick lit plots and transforms them into original and fantastic plots. Now I must say I am a bit bummed out and the reason is because I have to wait another full year for the next novel by Sophie Kinsella. I might pick up some of her previous ones to pass the time. I seriously recommend Wedding Night to chick lit lovers as well as YA novel readers who want to branch out their usual reading genres.in Ikonos, a greek island back when she was 18.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|HE LOVES IT!!!!!!  I can even play with little help from him.. proved to be mom friendly.  Glad I bought it.
B000J4QWM2|5.0|Colin and Gong Li are so hot together!  The pace and scenery of this movie are stunning, lots of action.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Story was somewhat good, but a little too much blood everywhere. I don't think I would watch it again. Altogether, entertaining enough.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|This is nothing like we thought it was going to be... We expected more like batman dark night not just flying around .. pretty lame already uninstalled
B0041KKYBA|4.0|It was an eye opener, didn't really know what caused the financial disaster, so much was covered up.  America is in more trouble than we know.  One reason is we have gotten away from God!
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game is by far one of the best games on AMAZON app store. it paid 2.99 and it was worth it and my 15yr loves it too!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|when I got this game my cud fell in love whither it he is 4...when I got it I was like o ya this is my game... u well like it trust me...
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|the best game ever!!! highly recommend this game I would for sure download again and share with friends all the time
B000VOC90Y|4.0|This backpack is really nice, but a little on the small side for my laptop. It's great, really, other than the fact that I couldn't fit my laptop inside. My screen turned out to be 17.3 in and the backpack fits up to 17 in screens. Oh, well. Just be sure yours will fit before you buy. For those of you who need a larger one, with lots of room, I would check out Everki EKP120 Titan Laptop Backpack. It's pricey, but it is worth the money!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|What a thriller!! I felt like I was right in the middle of the story the entire time.  I actually had to put it down a few times because I was so into it and needed to take a break from the intense drama that was unfolding.  If you're looking for a book that keeps you totally engrossed and full of anticipation, I highly recommend it!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Watching this season now. Great job with it Even starting with the first episode, they know how to lock you in!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really good book. Well written, enjoyable characters. The book kept you the whole way through. Would recommend it for end of the world type stories.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Really loved this movie. The German is such a great character. Prepare yourself for gratuitous use of the N word, perhaps they over did it on that, but didnt find it too distracting
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My Little Pony is a fun game that is educational and exciting. If more people watched/ played My Little Pony we would be better with friendships.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app helps me relax after a long day. Soothing sounds to fall asleep to. Check it out, you might like it as well.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I like many grew up wi this series and after a tough period near the end it wrapped up with a fitting finale. Worth a read.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Another one of those &#34;free&#34; games that makes you have to buy actual items to even make the game playable.  I'm really getting sick of the free games section getting filled up with these so-called &#34;free&#34; games.  the items you have to pay for to even play the game at all would cost more that buying the app all at once.  Beware all of the free versions of the games.  app makers have jumped on the bandwagon of making a bunch of $$ off these &#34;free&#34; games.
B00BP4X7TG|4.0|This is a true &#34;feel good&#34; movie.  The two leads are wonderful together and the way Driss brings his new world to life is marvelous.  The fact that it is based on a true story makes it just that much better.
B005HEPS6A|3.0|I have said it before. They claim this to be a HD version. Plain old DVD is better. What more can I say.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it!! Would recommended it to everybody !!  So much information available there!!  So many ideas for home, fashion, travel.  You name it.!!!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This is a great show. It has a good blend of action, intrigue, religion,andd romance. It has been a long time since I've seen a show like this.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Not as edgy and real and gritty as \\"The Walking Dead\\", but this is still a cool series. Very imaginative and creepy aliens....good story line. Cast is stellar....equal amounts of good guys and bad guys in the human realm. Gets better in the second season....and I am looking forward to the new upcoming season in June. You never know what's coming next or who to trust in the storyline .... Keeps you on edge in a good way. Special effects are dynamite....not overly CGI-ish. Highly recommend checking it out.
B00001U0E1|5.0|This movie was needed to complete an assignment. The price was very reasonable and arrived in plenty of time to watch and write my review on. I still watch it every now and then. I would recommend it to anyone that needed or just wanted to buy movies through Amazon.com.
B004AKCME8|5.0|I've watched this film maybe 10 times, before buying it.  The animation is fantastic, extremely realistic.  The first time watching, I had trouble with the Aussie accents; but with rewatching, could hear the lines better.<br /><br />The DVD clarity is better on the same HD TV, versus the Comcast airings.  Wow.  Golly, I could watch this every day and not get bored.<br /><br />There is a song in the middle of the film which serves as its theme that I don't like, but I just turn down the sound during that sequence.  Next minus: it's a pain to use this DVD.  You're stuck with a ton of previews you can't get out of (except to keep hitting the skip buttons), before you can even get to the DVD menu.  Please someone, fix that annoyance, in future editions?  In Windows 7, the DVD kept getting stuck (32-bit Windows 7, Dell 780).  But that could be the computer.  Seems to play just fine, in the DVD player and my Win 7 laptop.  Third minus: the scene selections aren't titled.<br /><br />There are two special DVD features:  one, on the importance of owls in nature, very charming, roughly 15 minutes.  The second special, is a short cartoon, 'The Fur of Flying', with our pal Wiley Coyote and Road Runner.  It looks almost like 3D, on my Toshiba 1080p TV monitor.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Awesome show! glad i could watch it on amazon, it's hard to find really. Would most definitely recommend to a friend!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Pretty phenomenal writing. What could be complex and boring Goodwin makes clear and interesting. Little known historical figures are brought to life and help flesh out the world Lincoln lived in. It is fascinating reading!
1402786360|4.0|I've been following Heather's blog since before the book. Her recipes are wonderful and she's great at her craft. This book is good for both novices and intermediates. It starts off easy and is difficult towards the end, but is possible with practice! And even if you don't want to bake, just get it for the beautiful step by step pictures.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Awesome!!!  Almost ready for Season Two!  My daughter and nephew recommended this series.  A little gorey at times, but that's to be expected.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is truly a wonderful one. I can put it on wherever I am and can RELAX with the many choices of relaxing sound combinations. Thank you!
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|he is the most coolest kid ever. he gets whatever he wants because he's awesome. he likes cake. he is cool
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|[[ASIN:1400069742 Those Angry Days: Roosevelt, Lindbergh, and America's Fight Over World War II, 1939-1941]]<br /><br />Lynne Olson has given prewar history a shot in the arm by revealing the machinations of governing and non-governing figures attempting either to engage the U.S. in the European conflict or to isolate us from that bloody turmoil. The coverage is even-handed and without a partisan edge, reporting the lies and deceit foisted on the public . A thorough research effort that deserves high praise. If there is any weakness, it may be the overemphasis on the Lindbergh family and their relationships during those years. It took Pearl Harbor to unite the nation.<br /><br />D K Elliott, Author, The Canyon Caper; dkelliottfl.com
B002VPE1WK|4.0|it has a good size but kind of small... is nice if you have a camera and a few things, but if you'll work professionally than it will be small for your purposes.
B00006HAZG|3.0|Since I had not seen this version of the story, I bought it - but, to my thinking, it did not measure up to the 1974 version with David Yelland.  It was fine but the assorted characters that so enhance this tale, were not as colorful as in the other version.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The game is fun and somewhat addicting. It starts slow building up your park, but it gets better as you play more.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Big enough to see and very easy to work . The best I found! Differently would recommend to family and friends.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|So much has been written about the awesomeness of this show and the sadness of it being cancelled that there's no point in my adding much more. It was great while it lasted - rich world, deep characters, fun dialogue... 'Nuff said.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love having the ability of going directly to my mail.  Make life slot easier. Would recommend this apt to all.
0783226837|4.0|The aspect is 1.85. It is not HDML compatible in that on my TV the shapes are distorted if I try to fill the screen. It does look proper with a component connection.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitator is a great game.  You can play at your own pace or challenge others with speed and skill.  Never get tired of it.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Lots of energy and upbeat. Good, believable characters.  Perfect for getting away from TV! word, word, word, word, word, word - there I put 6 more words in. Oops - now its 7
B004XDYJRU|5.0|So many options - so easy to use. I no longer have a stand-alone radio in my house this does it all.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Excellent style & effective suspense. An action packed story of the insane brutality permitted by slavery. The pathetic impotence of the female characters was disturbingly palpable and psychologically frustrating.
B0070DOHQS|3.0|If you need TS Gateway support to access your systems, this app will not work, but otherwise an overall decent rdp app.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I've been with Vampire Weekend ever since I first saw \\"A-Punk\\" on VH1, and am happy to say that they just keep getting better. I loved their first cd and then nearly went wild when Contra came out. But this one takes it to a new level. Rarely do you find artists willing to devote time to making songs that simultaneously are lyrically beautiful and musically textured. We saw that with the first two albums, and now Vampire Weekend has proven how consistent they are by delivering another round of catchy, layered tunes.<br /><br />In all honesty, I was a bit hesitant in purchasing Modern Vampires, despite how habitually I listen to their other albums. Mainly, I thought their sound might be getting too different. But after listening to the samples, I decided to go ahead and make the purchase, if not just in support of their previous work. I was thoroughly relieved to find that I still feel a profound connection with their songs. In a way, they are getting different, but in no way have they rewrote their style. Modern Vampires of the City fits naturally in the VW trio, and gracefully echoes many of the themes found in previous tracks without any trace of redundancy. It also looks great next to their other albums.<br /><br />A word to any of you still on the fence: the samples do not give this album justice! Without the natural context of the songs, you miss out on the smooth transitions between tracks. And these transitions play a key role in creating the progression of thought that weaves this album into the complex story that it is.<br /><br />In short, this album is a real tribute to Vampire Weekend's resiliency in style. Modern Vampires of the City proves to be rife with songs that elicit strong visceral reactions and for many of the songs there will likely be a new interpretation for each listening. That's the great thing about Vampire Weekend: each song is so intricately structured that it becomes a living thing, and it grows and matures as you do. Be prepared for words that dig deep and melodies that mercilessly play in your head whether you like it or not.<br /><br />But take it from me: you'll like it. :)
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This is a really good movie!  The store is unexpected and the filming is beautiful and the acting is excellent!
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|I thought the film was a great historical narative.  However, based on the early reviews and all of the Oscar nominations I was disappointed. I was also put off by the darkness (cinematography?) of the film. On the other hand any movie that Daniel Day-Lewis is in is worth watching.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I absolutely love the deep character twists!  The storybook fairy tales that you've been told all through your childhood have grown up.  This show keeps you thinking and surprises you!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I heard about this product at work, and am very glad that we bought it.  This is a great board game for the entire family.  Rather than sit in front of the TV, this is an ideal way to spend the evening
B009EHDU7U|4.0|This is a very readable story, which gets you in from page one and gathers momentum quickly. Characters are unusual.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|doctor octor mother flippen gaunapus bbbbbbaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! that's how awesome this game is.even though I haven't played it yet just know it is going to be great
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This was a great story with more depth to it than I anticipated.  It leaves you thinking about life, past, present and future.  The character is endearing.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|It is refreshing to read an engrossing page turner with a very human, and not so pleasant, main character. She's flawed and knows it, and yet I did care what happened to her. She's not the only one, I can't think of any of the characters that I would admire and yet I couldn't put it down. It's all about what it says on the cover, 'Dark Places' and those places are the minds of the characters. Having said that, it's not too deep and meaningful as such - it's an easy read.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|eh its okay it takes a whlie to build up everything but i like it because its disney and everything disney is good
B009NY43NY|1.0|SOOOO MAD/SAD!!!! How could Charlaine Harris destroy her world that millions of fans have been dedicated for over 14 years! WHY WHY WHY? This was a poorly scripted plot--horrible outcomes and a lack of that spark that caught everyone's attention from the first book that created the HBO series True Blood! I REALLY hope they do not follow the book's conclusion!  ERIC & SOOKIE ARE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER----FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Does what I got it for.  The ads are at the top and don't detract from the calculator keys or output.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Wonderful  performances and great time era piece.  So enjoyable, that my husband and I try to watch only one episode at a time, and &#34;save&#34; episodes for later.  Doesn't always work...........
B0010SEN18|5.0|I've had the pleasure of photographing things I had no business being at with my experience.  I've shot the NFL, MLS, professional Arean Soccer, the DNC and more all because of the people I was lucky enough to know.  Joes advice would have served me well early in my career and is still relevant.  This was a great book if you're a newb you should certainly read this.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is just the best Masterpiece classic to date.  Love the characters, and the actors are terrific.  Its a lovely time piece of an era long gone and it informs the viewers of the times and cultures of the past.  Loving it.
B008QE9BS4|5.0|The CD played flawless and was the only used CD posted.  The price was low even though it shipped all the way from Prague.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Every whovian in the world should have one of these. But buy two, sometimes the uv ink comes dried out.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This book does a great job of adding additional depth of character to Jack Reacher. There is a lot less 'action' and more political/dramatic narrative which is great. I'm looking forward to seeing what book #3 has in store for me.
B00338QENI|4.0|Henrietta's story and that of her family til today interested me more than the story of the HeLa cells. Very we'll written too
B00A83075M|5.0|Simple comment says it all, Everything you expect it to be.  A kids movie that adults can enjoy as well!  Buy it for an enjoyable experience.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I was moved to read this with the current unrest in North Korea and uncertainty about the future.  The unbelievably harsh life of this tortured soul is shocking to even the poorest person in the US.  The stark contrast between lifestyles in North and South Korea is well exposed, and this man's journey to freedom is clearly not enough to free him of the horrors of his childhood.  One sees a dynasty which has absolutely no inherent respect for human life.  Not a fun read, but most enlightening.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|It's a toy! Don't have high expectations! My granddaughters enjoy it, as with so many other apps, it's a fun way to kill time.
B006P96PAO|5.0|I wish everyone could see this movie!<br />these men come from all walks of life, each having their own background story that intertwines and intersects int his powerful drama. This is an intense movie. I would say that it is a family friendly movie, and a great conversation starter among both friends and families. This movie is inspiring and encouraging. The quality is good, plot is good, and the resolution will leave you a changed person. Please watch- everyone.
0811879542|5.0|This book is completely original and a delight to read with your child.  Each page gives you the perfect words as the reader to lead your child through this highly interactive book.  They press in one place and all the balls roll to one side on the next page.  It is as responsive as a digital book but genius because it manages to accomplish the same thing with zero technology. My four year old was fascinated and sat in rapt attention.  As soon as we finished the story she immediately asked to read it again, and then again, and then again.  It is the only book that can pull her away from the iPad.  If you only owned 10 books for your child, this should be one of them.  Absolutely brilliant!
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Disappointing film.  Almost quit watching after the first 20 minutes, but forced myself to continue.  Total waste of time.  The villian is weak, plot is predictable, no witty or entertaining banter.  Craig has a sour-lemon look on his face for the entire 2+ hours.  Worst 007 movie ever.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|My grandson and I would watch this every day at nap time. He learned how to work a VCR before he could talk! He'll be 16 this year and I needed a reminder of special memories long ago...
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This movie is excellent . Appeals to a wide variety of audiences and has something for everyone. I want to watch it again !
B000O8OTNC|5.0|A truly useful item just keeps everything sharper ! I would buy this again and recommend this for first time buyers very very handy.
B00B2DSK06|4.0|Such a cute movie, and funny for adults too. A few scary parts for little kids or otherwise would have given 5 stars
B009B8YZIK|5.0|loved the video games franchises and this hit the spot where a halo movie needed to be, hopeful to see more! product quality was great!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I love this case.  It's exactly what I expected! I have a case for another e-reader and this is equally as well made and comfortable to use.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|I really like this case, however its a bit cumbersome. It could be a little more compact. The red slide tends to fall off as well, but it is easily fixable.
B001CDWFPC|3.0|I don't know if its just me, but I find this Study Bible very difficult to navigate. I own a nook and it is much easier to go from book to book and back without getting totally lost and having to close out the app and start over. Very frustrating when I'm doing my Bible lesson and need to cross reference several different books of the Bible. I wish I'd stuck with my nook for easy maneuverability even though its more cumbersome than the kindle.
B000IYU9IG|2.0|I was hoping for a Western.  This is just a repackaging of The Quiet Man (which was excellent) for the audiences who wanted to see John Wayne spank Maureen O'Hara in her undies.  Just rent The Quiet Man and have a Guiness instead.
B0077EBWVI|1.0|I thought a remake would not only follow a similar storyline (it did), but also might deliver the same good feeling as the the original (it didn't). I could not get through the first hour.
0425252868|5.0|About 80% of the book is from the German Luftwaffe viewpoint, which gives great insight into their moral values. They had little regard for the NAZI party.  Many pictures of the pilots included.
B0019TSI8W|5.0|Two loveable characters that have different needs, but just can't figure them out at the same time, until finally one day...
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|It's nice to see these two actors together in a movie. Excellent chemestry and Julianne is super talented. You won't be wasting your time watching this movie. Little kid actors are adorable, very skilled.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Love this series. LOVE. Always wondering what's going to happen next. I am not an HBO subscriber, so sadly I see the series long after it airs, but it is so good that I am willing to purchase the entire season without already having seen it first. I just know it's going to be good. (And it is!)
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Darlene is  a  worshipper and  it  shows  in all her  works. When  she  partners  with  Israel  is  pure  great chemistry .
B008Y6ZTKS|5.0|My girls love it because it is about teens and the ocean and the message it sends it just great, they have it downloaded on a kindle and we chose to buy it so they could watch it again.
159562015X|5.0|I've heard a lot about this study but never had the chance to take it. I learned what my top 5 strengths are. A few of them surprised me and others I knew that's exactly what I was. Most of the book is devoted to talking about the strengths and how you can utilize them in your life and job. My only desire would be to learn more about the science behind how they score the tests. Really great resource for developing your giftings and seeing where your weaknesses are.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|one of the best shows of all time.  The story line is awesome.  Cant wait until season 4 to come out!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I was very excited when I heard Peter Jackson was going to make The Hobbit into a movie. Yes, there was still money to be made out of this franchise, but I'd rather have Peter Jackson tackle this story and stories from The Simarillion than anyone else. The Hobbit is a softer, simpler story than Lord of the Rings, but it is still a good companion to the other three movies. Visual effects, costuming, make up are beautiful. The costumer did a great job creating looks for each of the dwarfs to distinguish them. And Andy Serkis as Gollum is amazing. It's a good movie. You should watch it at least once.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the DVD, because it wasn't simple to get the digital copy to put on my devices which is why I bought this version. For future purchases, I will attempt to avoid the ultra violet digital version because it wasn't helpful to me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|When I found out part two was coming out I had to make some time to read the book. I expect it to be as good if not better than the first!
B004FWWTVC|5.0|We had already seen the movie, it is a classic. The quality wasn't great, so we downloaded it to Amazon Unbox, and the quality wasn't any better. Similar to a VHS tape, but not bad for an older movie.
B001EN71CW|5.0|It took a while to pic this up since I already owned the regular DVDs.  I can say that I really enjoy the blu-ray.  Same stories that we're familiar with, but the quality of the sound and video is outstanding.  If you've never been introduced to this series this is a must have.  If you already own and love Firefly, the blu-ray was worth the upgrade.
B008D490F6|4.0|Great movie, a classic we have seen many times before. We were a little disappointed in the picture quality, but it isn't bad for a 1980's movie, similar quality to VHS.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|Sure the last one was hit-or-miss, but the first one and second one are great!  Digital copies were a great addition as well!
B000CBEWZ6|2.0|Love this movie, decide to buy but the format is wrong! for those who don't know what i'm talking about, you must have region 1 formating for the US and this movie is region 2(aisa and japan) so it doesn't play in any dvd player i have. Now i have to go through the trouble of sending it back to the seller because they didn't advertise it as a region 2 formatted disc.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|My husband and I rent thist movie for our date night. Awesome movie, we enjoy every minute of it. I will buy a copie of this movie, because I would like to watch again. 5 stars movie
B009VA1FN6|5.0|This book is another great mystery read by this stunning author.  Focussing on a mother-daughter relationship and how families can sabotage each other with love.  Beautiful settings and a very haunting mood make this book a delight.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey has become one of my new favorite shows. Good acting, the house is eye-candy, and fulfills my need for all the plots that once happened in night-time soaps.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just couldn't stop watching. Watched the whole season in my two days off. A must have for any collector.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book a ton.  I just love how it is written in a letter format and just everything about it.
B00915G6YE|5.0|can someone tell me if the Blu Ray versions have subtitles in spanish?  I'm a big fan of the show, i'd like to buy all seasons but i really want the subtitles in spanish.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|What can I say, its like a daft punk album.  I loved the movie, visually stunning.  And because of the way the film looks, the audio is so important to the film.  This brings it home.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|Worst app Eva.its terriblee. It suckes so bad I want to burn it to death and eat it lime a pickle
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought I was in love with Temple Run......but wow....Temple Run 2 is explosive!!!  So much to do and the graphics are great!  I get lost in this game without fail! Great game.....everyone needs to try it once!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Been using swift key for sometime and it just gets better and better overtime. The layout of the keyboard works well and the added swipe function is a great bonus.
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|This is a terribly written, predictable, boring, and unrealistic book.  Yes, there are lovely Irish phrases in the dialogue but does that make up for anything?  No.  The characters are one-dimensional, completely unbelievable, and it's clear from the first ten pages how the story will end.  I can't believe I paid money for it.  Consider this your warning
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This keeps me on track and keeps me going to do better at my Bible reading! I really need the motivation and accountability!
B009AMANH4|5.0|A nice take on the story of Lincoln. You get a feel for the man, the period, and those around the man. While some things have changed human kind has remain the same. This movie shows us the best and worse of us.
1563899426|5.0|Ever miss your childhood friends, Snow, Cindy, Rose, Bigby...you know the usual suspects?  Wonder what they're up to? Wonder no more!<br /><br />Like us, they were driven from the wonderful lands of fairies to our grimy modern world and forced to assimilate.  But is what's driven them away really ready to let them go that easy?
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|just three words I love it its just amazing cant explain it the graphics in the menu screen love it its just so amazing!!!
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|Great writing, great humor, unreal debauchery, great resurrection back to the heights of thrash metal. Go get it now, you will blow through this selection fast without regret.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love the game.the graphics are awesome and I like how u can Rome around the you don't have to do missions.totally worth the $
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|This was a great movie.  Helped me understand how LAPD got their old-LAPD reputation and why it was so important during the time gangsters were trying to take over LA.  Had some gruesome scenes in it, but also was filled with laughter, excitement, and suspense.  There were two love stories in this movie, one of a married couple and one of a gangster and his girl.  Both were great love stories and this movie is filled with great actors/actresses.  A definite movie choice.
B00821OX98|5.0|i loved this show its full of action without to much romance its the first alien invasion show ive seen that comes close to how i picture a real one if there is life out there just hope the aliens that appear at the end of season two are good guys now
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Loved this movie!!!  I liked it because it was suspenseful, made you think, made you laugh, and had a lot of action all packed in to 1.5+ hours.<br /><br />Loved this movie because it did NOT have sex scenes or lots of language.<br /><br />I'm not a repeat movie watcher, and this one I could watch several times.  Rented it, but it's definitely one to buy and download.  You see more each time you watch it.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|Most films you get on the first viewing. This may not be one of them.<br /><br />\\"Cloud Atlas\\" may not be your type of film but if it is and it intrigues you enough, you'll find yourself drawn back to watch it more than once because of the nonlinear storytelling which thematically links six different periods of time from the past, present to the future. The theme driving the film is that our lives have a ripple effect through time and that our souls continue to reappear with a chance of absolution for past mistakes. In some cases the characters (those played by Hugo Weaving and Hugh Grant for example) continually get it wrong and grow worse with each incarnation.<br /><br />As others have pointed out \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is much like [[ASIN:B008ROF4VG The Fountain [HD]]] except that the editing of the film links each era based on actions, events and what happens to the characters in each given year. The stories take place in the following times/places: 1849 in the South Pacific as a lawyer tries to broker a slave deal; England and Scotland in 1936 as a gay composer struggles to complete his own masterpiece; San Francisco, CA 1978 focusing ona reporter trying to break a story about a dangerous power plant who's life is in danger; England in 2012 as a publisher gets an unexpected windfall when his author (a former thug)kills a critic; the year 2144 in Neo Seoul (Korea) as a \\"Fabricant\\" (an artifically engineer person) is interviewed about leading a revolution prior to her execution; the big island in an undisclosed far future where Earth has fallen into two camps--one advanced and the other primative struggling to survive on what's left of our world.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is a very nice transfer of the film. Each period has a unique look to it in terms of the photography and color scheme. We also get a lossless 5.1 audio mix as well as Spanish and French tracks. There are also subtitles in all English, Spanish and French.<br /><br />The description by Amazon is incorrect. The film DOES include special features. There isn't a commentary track (which is sad but understandable given that Lana and Andy Wachowskis don't care for doing them) however both appear with co-director/co-writer Tom Tykwer [[ASIN:B009NNG202 Perfume: The Story of a Murderer [HD]]] and [[ASIN:B00103584Y Run Lola Run [Blu-ray]]] ) in a series of featurettes that include David Mitchell the author of the original novel.<br /><br />The featurettes:<br /><br /> \\"A Film Like No Other\\" (7:15), \\"Everything Is Connected\\" (8:00),\\"Impossible Adaptation\\" (9:07),\\"The Essence of Acting\\" (7:20),\\"Spaceships, Slaves and Sextets\\",\\"The Bold Science Fiction of Cloud Atlas\\" (7:14) and \\"Eternal Recurrence\\" (7:39)each focusing on a different aspect of the production from the adaptation of Mitchell's novel to the challenge of playing the mulitple characters and how the actors connected with them.<br /><br />The menu is static and, aside from the image from the cover of the box, surprisingly generic.<br /><br />For those willing to give the film a chance and not looking for a more conventional bit of entertainment \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is worth it. For others, it will be a journey that is as pointless as the characters Hugh Grant and Hugo Weaving play in the film.<br /><br />Not everyone will like the film and it takes getting used to a narrative not told in a conventional sense but for those up to the challenge \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is a rewarding (if flawed) film that tries to do things a bit differently.he film DOES include special features.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|puzzles were very easy.  hidden pictures were somewhat. challenging. completed the game in hours. wish someone would create a game for adults that is not as easy.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|It's the doctor!  What else can I say.  David Tennat is fantastic and always entertaining to watch.  One more word...
B000XKZQ74|5.0|I watched this movie for a paper assignment I had in my political science class, I was not expecting to get hooked in this movie. Despite this movie being in German and having subtitles, it is a great movie, I was completely surprised. It was a great film historically, politically, and captivating. The characters and the plot are great. The ending was the best part, having everything have some sort of closure. I definitely recommend this movie!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it!  I have it with me everywhere I go. Makes it very handy. Big numbers,  full screen,  easy to use and free!
193700788X|1.0|I enjoyed this series up to book 12.  Book 13 was very disappointing.  Save your time and money and skip this one!  Maybe Ms. Harris will consider writing a do-over one day.
1452110581|4.0|I bought this book for my son and his wife, who are true cat lovers (no children) and for my &#34;grand-cats&#34;. The author really got into the mind of the typical cat, which is sometimes hard to do!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I  would recommend it to anyone who likes a go suspence.  Had to keep reading to find out who did the murder.
B000OLROWC|4.0|I watched this in the theatre when it first came out. I was really into martial arts at the time.  However, the most compelling part of this movie is the human story and the relationships formed and the Karate is secondary to that. Great family movie, my children watched this at a fairly young age with my guidance.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Got this for my son but I am now addicted to it!!  Great game for yourself or children.  And a great time killer.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Fun game and easily addictive. Good graphics. Stacks up well against other kindle games. Price is good too, and that's a plus.
0545265355|5.0|These books inside and out are beautiful. Suzanne has to be one of the greatest authors yet. These books kept me on edge and I didn't put them down until I was finished. 3 books in 5 days. And I'm bound to read them over and over again. The collection is a must have and the packaging is beautiful.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this game. Love this game. Love this game. LOVE THIS GAME!! oh, and did I say...I love this game? :) I would rate it 10 stars if I could. Thanks for the Coins, Amazon!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This App is great for studying books of the Bible and the way it highlights verses in each chapter is grand.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I liked these a lot more  than I expected to, considering they are much older than most books I read. You really get to know the characters and their personalities.
B008M721MS|5.0|I like this device, it will help me to see my children and grandchildren that lives a ways from me.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Criminal Minds is the most intreging show on television. No matter what episode you watch you are on the edge of your seat.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Math.<br />Money.<br />Brad Pitt.<br />Baseball.<br />Failure.<br />Success.<br />Heartstrings tugged.<br />True story.<br />How could this NOT be a great buy???<br />My husband watches it ALL the time, like an obsession, almost. :)
B00BT0ZS52|5.0|This is such a great film. Hallie Berry was terrific, each story was so beautiful. It is a much watch for everyone
141690977X|1.0|Wikipedia describes Greg Behrent as graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in theater from the University of Oregon, though initially he had enrolled to be a business major and play rugby. He also lent \\"a straight man's perspective\\" to the silly and unrealistic HBO comedy Sex and the City.  His expertise on the affairs of men and women therefore is pretty much nonexistent.<br />Behrent says,  \\"If he's not calling you, it's because you are not on his mind.\\"  This is a foolish and irresponsible thing to say because it's simply NOT true much of the time.  My boyfriend of several years never initiated phone calls with me for the first year we knew each other.  If I had heeded this book's advice, I would have moved on and missed out on the best relationship I have ever had.  Instead, I analyzed the situation, realized he was both extremely busy and exhausted working overtime and raising two kids and somewhat gun shy having gone through a bad marriage and divorce.  So, I took it upon myself to call him.  He would agree to get together but then he would not call afterward.  So, I'd call again.  He'd apologize for being busy and tired.  This went on and on.  Once I got frustrated by it and said, \\"Look, you obviously don't need me\\" and broke it off.  The next day he called me and asked me to reconsider.  It was obviously a very difficult thing for him to do.  After that, he remained as unaggressive as ever for several months.  But slowly, he began to reciprocate to the point that now he initiates as much as I do.  He did spend many months not calling me, but he has told me that I was constantly in his thoughts and that he found my pursuit of him flattering and fun.  There are many valid reasons why a man may not call a woman.  He may be shy, reluctant due to past experiences or just really too busy.  Do yourself a favor and don't let generalizations by self-appointed experts dictate whether or not you find happiness in life.  What Behrent and his ilk are doing is making you insecure in your relationship with a guy who just might be the guy you were meant to be with and at the same time allowing other women who aren't persuaded by this silly book to be with him instead of you.  This book is WAY overrated.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Awesome Colorful and lots of fun. Really enjoyed the different scenes and graphics are magical !loving the G5 Games!  enjoy
B004GYY714|5.0|this game is awesome the songs are endless to choose from you don't have to wait an hour to find the right station all u need to do is just t<br />ap and your listening to the music
B00A32GZOK|5.0|[Note:  Reviews prior to Feb. 2013 do not relate to the U.S. Blu-ray version.]. I've been waiting for years for Joseph Losey's 1979 film of Don Giovanni to appear on Blu-ray.  I first encountered it in a theater, then purchased the VHS tape.  I would have bought the earlier DVD, except that reviewers widely panned the sound.  The French film company Gaumont issued it on Blu-ray on 2010, but in a solely European format.  Finally, Olive Films has released a Blu-ray version for U.S. viewers (as well as a new, presumably improved, DVD).<br /><br />Although filmed operas always raise some objections, I've never found another version of Mozart's masterpiece that I've enjoyed as much.  (My favorite live production stars Bryn Terfel from the Met.)  The Vicenza settings are spectacular--especially the final consuming fire--and  cannot be equaled on any opera house stage.  Ruggero Raimondi makes a most believable Don, and the other members of the cast also shine both as singers and actors.  Lorin Maazel conducts the orchestra and chorus of the Paris Opera in a fine performance.  The quality of the audio and video are very good, if not fully equal to those of a 21st century recording.<br /><br />I don't know if Olive's Blu-ray transfer is the same as Gaumont's, although it really doesn't matter, since the latter can't be viewed on U.S. players anyway.  Gaumont also included a disc of extras, including documentaries on making the original film and on remixing it for Blu-ray.  Olive gives us only the film, with optional English subtitles--but that's enough.
B000P0J06K|4.0|I loved this entry in the Batman saga.  I thought Michael Keaton did a great job, as Bruce Wayne AND as Batman.  He was a suitable mate for Kim Basinger.  Give me a touch of humor with my action movies EVERY time!
193700788X|1.0|Look, you are reading a Sookie Stackhouse book, you aren't expecting high art.  I am sure I wasn't.  This seemed like a combination of fan service with all the returning characters, and a quick wrap up a the end.  It really seemed like CH sort of ran out of contracted books, had always planed for the ending to be the way it was, but the whole thing feels rushed in the last half of the book.  They have been steadily dropping in quality, but I had no expectations that this would be so god-awful.  Skip it.  Go buy something better.
B00AG475K8|5.0|3 of my favorite young actors of the 80s in a cute and sentimental story about missing what's right in front of you!
B001VFTYWI|1.0|I barely got through the first 50 pages, and I'm wondering if Patricia Cornwell went off her drugs, got amnesia or outsourced the writing to a very low quality writer.<br />There is historical knowledge of the characters but no real deep understanding of the people she spent 10 years developing. It's like someone read a 5 line brief on each character and then wrote this book. And the language is more like a 6th grader pupil than an established author.<br />Bad, very bad. Think I will drop this one as is.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I thought the first movie, Before Sunrise, was terrific.  Poignant, fun, thought-provoking.  This is a good sequel to it.  The characters are just as engaging, and I still want to see what happens on their new continuing adventure.
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|I can understand why Hoffman, Phoenix and Adams were nominated for their acting. Truly great performances. The film overall lacked a continuity that I found frustrating.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|My daughter asked for this for Christmas.  Since we both enjoyed the movie so much, I had to get it for her, and the regular DVD for me!  Interesting dystopian story.  Can't wait to see the subsequent novels on the screen!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Had a lot of stereotypical elements but somehow managed to not feel cliched at all, and told a love story that felt sincere and original.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This really whet my interest for the last movie!  What a great lead-in.  I am impressed how well the movies have been following the books, and the different directors's interpretations.  Great job!
B005PK56TA|4.0|Took a while to figure out what was going on.  The intertwined stories and going back and forth in time was well done.  Captivating actors and plots.  Watch it under the covers for safety!
B0045HCJRQ|4.0|2 of my favorite stars in a very interesting plot.  Is this the man I married?  Do I care?  He's so much better!  What would YOU do?
B009CG11WY|4.0|It's a classic! Good and entertaining, along with some eye opening issues. Great highschool flick, definitely from the 80's. It made me laugh.
B0045HCJT4|5.0|Kurt Russell has played in all genres and he is great in all of them.  I like this as much as I did Stargate.  A similar role, but still a standout as a 'programmed' soldier in the future.
B00BGZ8TVA|4.0|Very engaging film.  Kept me listening for pretty much the entire time.<br />SPOILER BELOW<br /><br />I don't like the way it cut between today and the time of the story.  It could have been written without all the today crap and been a much better movie.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Very true to the book.  It was interesting to see the depiction of what I'd only read about and imagined.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This version is challenging, but not impossible like some of the other versions I've played. The graphics are excellent and the definition is impeccable. I plan to play this and other levels whenever I have a chance.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|A marathon of movie watching for a weekend!  When this came in, my family had to watch them all in sequence.
