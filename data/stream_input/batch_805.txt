B001EC9V58|5.0|REC is in my mind one the best zombie film i have seen since Day Of The Dead it's only 75 mins but it dose not matter how long it is cause this film had me on edge from start to finish.<br /><br />The film is about a news crew who fallows a group of fire fighters they get a call to rescue a old lady in a block of apartments but happens next becomes a fight for survival and to make matters worse the army won't let the surivours out and it's up to them to find out what has caused this nightmare.<br /><br />The whole film is in spainsh and the film is only 75 mins long but the film is scary as hell think of it as Blair Witch meets 28 Days Later it might take a while for the film to bulid but the final 15 mins is hart stopping highly recomended for those who love zombie film or anyone who wants to be scared s**tless.

1400032717|4.0|The Boston Globe called this book, \\"gloriously eccentric...\\" which is an inaccurate way to represent this story by Mark Haddon.  If anything, Haddon enters the world of autism and demystifies it, making it less eccentric.  We see the world through the eyes of fifteen year-old Christopher Boone, who abhors the color yellow, but calms himself by solving complicated math problems in his head.  The reader learns to re-calibrate his or her own emotional responses a la Christopher, for whom things hurt according to their logical content or lack thereof.<br /><br />This book has many strengths, and Christopher's father is perhaps one of the best examples of a sympathetic but highly flawed character.  While Christopher is undoubtedly the book's protagonist, the non-autistic reader will more likely empathize with Christopher's father, who is capable of both great love and great destruction.<br /><br />Aside from Christopher's discussions with his therapist Siobhan, the book wisely veers away from preachy explanations about autism.  Even the therapy sessions are more about interpersonal connection than outlining the intricacies of autism, and it is this that helps the reader to connect to Christopher in something other than sympathy.  We engage with Christopher's world, not the world of autism...and this is right as autism spectrum disorders defy generalizations or easy categories.<br /><br />The end result, if anything, is that the eccentricity of general humanity is exposed.  We become conscious of our everyday lack of logic.  The novel  is just as much about the human condition as the autistic condition.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Being a fan of the [[ASIN:B00005N5S5 The Terminator]], [[ASIN:B00004TRD8 Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (The Ultimate Edition DVD)]], [[ASIN:B00005JM0B Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]] movies, I have found this series to be a very pleasant continuation of the story line. Here are my observations:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1)Stays true to the story line of the Terminator movies<br />2)Great acting, including the very understated Summer Glau as the \\"good\\" terminator<br />3)Surprisingly good special effects for a TV series. I have seen much worse effects in some recent movies.<br />4)Solid plot/subplot story telling<br /><br />Cons:<br />1)The DVD \\"extras\\" were nothing special<br />2)Some of the technology and events (very early on) required significant \\"suspension of disbelief\\". No spoilers from me, but this was required to move a plot device along and was not repeated.<br /><br />Over all this is a great start to what could be a fantastic Sci-Fi series!<br /><br />Highly recommended for Terminator fans!

031606792X|1.0|Breaking Dawn is the fourth novel of Stephenie Meyer's successful \\"Twilight\\" series. Although not a great literary work (the author admits she never attempted writing before Twilight), the story was intriguing and left me interested enough to read through New Moon and Eclipse. With Breaking Dawn as the final novel, I expected the series to finish off with a flourish worthy of a best-selling series.<br /><br />Instead, the series finished off with an extremely rushed and poorly written Harry Potter-length novel with so many bizarre and questioning aspects, along with an inflated story which easily could have been at least 200 pages shorter with proper editing and an extra year to polish off some finer points.<br /><br />First off, the book was obviously written and rushed to printing, for the editing was poor, grammatical mistakes enormous for a series of such prominence, the plot (or, it could be argued lack of) strayed off course too many times, and there were extra side material which did not aid the plot of the novel, and therefore had no substantial place in the novel. Granted, it is a Romance, but that does not excuse the fact that there were so many sticky points in the book.<br /><br />To begin, the author's portrayal of the protagonist, Bella Swan, is atrocious. Bella is depicted as an extremely selfish, self-centered girl who has a psychological need to act like a martyr sacrificing herself no matter how much at fault she is for her actions. The protagonist is not sympathetic at all--she uses people in her life to get what she wants (Jacob in New Moon and beyond, Edward in all books) and whines when her own actions result in fiascos. The Mary-Sue qualities that she possesses is an insult to a strong female character. Sure, she is described as plain and so clumsy she trips over every pebble and every boy and man is attracted to her for absolutely no reason given (remember, she has guys falling on her lap before they even talk to her on her first day of school. They have done nothing but see her appearance so far. It is far-fetched to expect this).<br /><br />To focus only on Breaking Dawn, Meyer gives absolutely no solid reason for Bella to fear marriage when she is so willingly (and alarmingly) willing to commit herself to being a vampire. The two do not correlate. Her grotesque pregnancy and labor were defective attempts at character growth for Bella, and were blatantly disturbing to read. That aside, nothing comes close to grotesque and bizarre as the treatment of Jacob Black and the Quileutes in the novel. The process of imprinting in a novel in which a common theme is Choice is absurd and asinine. The fact that Jacob imprints on the daughter of the woman he has been head-over-heels in love with and forcefully sexually-assaulted in the previous book is outrageous, ludicrous, and idiotic. (For those who doubt Jacob's use of force in \\"kissing\\" Bella in the last book needs to reread the terms of law for sexual harassment and assault. The author included.) and The idea of a teen formerly in love suddenly \\"loves\\" an hour old child whom he cannot stay away from and will become a future mate to is perverted and paedophilic to say the very least. This was the only thing in the series that disgusted me in a very, very sick way that not even the forced assaults did. I cannot even express in words how such a flagitious plot device that was.<br /><br />On whole, the ending was slightly better from the abnormalties of the majority of the book. Admittingly, the pre-battle was too long and the actual \\"battle\\" a let down, which, if there was to be no action, could have been done in a more dramatic suspense, in lines with the novel REBECCA by Daphne DuMaurier, which could serve as an excellent example at a non-battle/fight with only words and wit.

Jillian is so intense but I really like her.  I enjoy that bootcamp style talking instead of some airhead jumping around asking how much for you're having.  The workout as others have said is a lot of squats, jumping jacks, push-ups, jumprope etc.  Nothing too hard choreography-wise just tiring! I recommend it for anyone looking to get in shape fast!

0380977273|3.0|Ray Bradbury'  s book was something that I've wanted to read for quite some time.  Unfortunately, I had already seen the film so I had a plot in mind as well as a mood.  Bradbury as always strings metaphores together like we do popcorn on the Christmas tree.  It's his main setup for atmosphere and that is the books great strength.  Unfortunately for me, the characters of Will, Jim and Will's Dad are flat, underdeveloped and dull. Without a back story, I really don't have a sense of caring for the characters and as hard as I tried that didn't change. This was typical of Dickens at times.  He created characters and then threw them into the story for development.  I never found this technique particularly inviting for me.     The story is simple enough -- a carnival comes to town creating strange and bizarre situations that invite temptation.  Jim wants to be older -- but we aren't given a good enough reason why.  Will's Dad wants to be younger and the idea feels more universal than centered on the character in question and it falls short.  The carnival can do this of course but at a price.  That alone feels as rundown an idea as I've ever read.  Everyone has that statement.  The ending feels more of a fable than anything else and perhaps that's what Ray wanted out of the story.  Perhaps he would have put 'once upon a time' and 'happily ever after' were it a different time.       The message -- don't fall into temptation and don't let misery eat away your soul.  I don't know, the book has great mood and atmosphere but had the same feel for me as 'Tale of Two Cities' -- I couldn't want to finish it and move on to something else.
0807126063|2.0|Someone compared this disaster to the Seinfeld tv series, and I suppose I would agree.  I never had much appreciation for Seinfeld and its desperate grasps at comedy; just so, Confederacy of Dunces relies largely on slapstick, nerve grating characters, and meandering plot.  The book drags on and on--the climax, that should indicate an easy, swift road to the conclusion, is so backward that the last 20 pages will be even harder to read through than some of the middle 20 pages.      In all fairness, there was some effective comedic elements; the voices of the characters were unique, and the language was elegant.  Its hard to say exactly why this greatly lauded, Pulitzer Prize winning novel failed to live up to my expectations, what literary mechanics failed Toole, but I would approach the reading of this book with a grain of salt or two.  Not something I would ever read twice.

Daniel Day Lewis did (as he always does) a spectacular job and deserved his Oscar in every way for his work in this film.<br /><br />His character is an ambitious oil seeker and has a heart that is just as black as the oil itself. I was in awe of how Daniel Day Lewis brought his character to life and I found myself in his world, unable to get out yet thankful I truly wasn't in it.<br /><br />\\"There Will Be Blood\\" was almost a book on film, that's how moving and gripping I found it. So graphic and yet so simply done. A great movie that in my opinion was robbed of the Oscar.

B000NDIAWY|5.0|The Story is a great album by a talented and magnetic singer/songwriter.  The music is pleasant on the ears, being stripped down and presented in \\"raw\\" form - very much suiting Carlile's attractive, somewhat versatile, and rich-as-milk voice, and the straightforward minimalist instrumentation.<br /><br />I love folk/rock, and indie artists are among the best (although Carlile's claim to that title is shot, given her big label affiliation).  But, like many people, I suspect, Carlile and this fantastic album slipped by me.  Why?  It's tough to find good music, and it's tougher for good musicians to find their audience.  Generally, artists of this genre are not going to be found on Top 40 or \\"Alternative\\" or Country or any other strong signal radio station.  The internet and satellite radio provide new avenues for connection, but those remedies have side effects of their own (more music doesn't always mean better music).  So, I missed her.  Then came the Olympics, and a haunting refrain sang by a yodeling woman on the General Motors television commercials - \\"I was made for you . . .\\" - as though a Buick LaCrosse was brought to life and is pledging its loyalty to me, if only I would buy.  After hearing this song about a dozen times, I executed a quick internet search and what do you know, I discovered Brandi Carlile.  Interestingly, Carlile offers a lengthy explanation on her website as to why she permitted this work of art to be used to peddle Chevy Malibus.  Of course, she explains, she is interested in the environment and GM is making electric cars (I am not making this up), plus she is interested in American jobs (someone needs to tell her who is actually making cars in what countries).  Come on.  This was embarrassing to read, and I was reminded of that dumb look on OJ's face when he tried the gloves on.  Let's be honest.  Artists like this deserve for their music to be heard, and sometimes you got to do what you got to do.  She did.<br /><br />About the music.  The title cut is the gem of the album.  Just as Bruce's \\"Born in the USA\\" was misinterpreted as a patriotic anthem, \\"The Story\\" is hardly a devotional love song.  It's a lyrically complicated piece about (I think) emotional dependence, pain, survival, and a bit of anger (but I still think it's a love song with a tenderness that is genuine).  Other greats include \\"Have You Ever\\" (an ethereal piece about the almost unspeakeable self-reflective experiences of walking in snow and similar pleasures of life), \\"Late Morning Lullaby\\" (a pleasant little song to listen to while your coffee cools, about the miserable thoughts that keeps one awake), \\"Turpetine\\" (another easy-listener, about the time we waste while playing games in relationships), and \\"Cannonball\\" (this one is about . . . well, it isn't a happy song either).  If you have heard this music, then you know how good it is.  And I don't want to give the impression that the album is a downer.  These songs are poetry, and the themes are real, like Dylan or Lyle Lovett or Steve Forbert.  I wouldn't call it dark: this isn't Hole.<br /><br />Beautiful album.

B00005JPY0|5.0|Just as Martin Scorsese's \\"Taxi Driver\\" was clearly a product of the violence and confusion that arose in the mid-1970s, Christopher Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight\\" is unmistakably spawned from the gloom and doom attitude America has adopted in recent years.  It is like looking through murky glass at a beautiful dream ruined, a vision brought to its knees and humiliated.  More cynical Americans would say this has happened to America.  \\"The Dark Knight\\" is about dealing with the destruction of that dream.  Should we abandon that dream?  Should we hold on to its tattered remains?  Or should we continue on, remembering that vision, following it as best we can, even though it no longer exists as once we dreamt it?     If it sounds absurd to dig so deep into a superhero movie, you've never read a comic book.  Around the mid-80s, comics became literature, thanks to authors like Alan Moore, whose comic \\"Watchmen\\" (soon to become a film directed by \\"300\\" director Zach Snyder) was listed by Time magazine as one of the 100 greatest novels of the 20th century.  Just as it took comic books over 40 years to become mature, complex, and relevant, it's taken the film industry about 30 years to make a superhero film that transcends clever self-awareness and intense action sequences.  \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a film without pretension or self-consciousness, the Batman film comic book readers have hardly dared dream of.  It is the best film since Richard Donner's classic \\"Superman\\" in 1978.  In fact, it's much better.  This is the greatest comic book film of all time, because this is a comic book film that makes you forget it's a comic book film.  Everything in this movie falls past fantasy and into the world of terrifying reality.    Warner Bros. and the film's producers made a brilliant decision hiring Christopher Nolan to re-start the Batman franchise back in 2005.  Nolan had previously made three immensely artistic and acclaimed independent films, chiefly 2000's \\"Memento.\\"  He was and is adirector who will never compromise his vision.  He may be the most skilled director in the business.  He's also one of the most cerebral directors, which is perfect for dealing with a character as psychologically complex as Bruce Wayne - a.k.a. Batman.  Tim Burton depicted Bruce Wayne as an eccentric, quirky, and mysterious millionaire in his films, where Wayne was portrayed by Michael Keaton, while Joel Schumacher depicted him as a rich playboy with no depth whatsoever for his two disastrous films in the late-1990s, which starred Val Kilmer and George Clooney.  Nolan's Wayne, played by the peerless Christian Bale, is a character who cannot escape his past, and who has built himself a vehicle to clear a path for a bright future.  That vehicle is Batman.  What Wayne does not realize is that Batman is destroying his future in the process.  Can Bruce Wayne escape Batman?  Should he escape Batman?  Or should he accept Batman as the life he has chosen?     Wayne is in love with Rachel Dawes, who is now played by Maggie Gyllenhaal.  She was previously played very unconvincingly by Katie Holmes in 2005's \\"Batman Begins.\\"  Gyllenhaal is a much more satisfying actor, and she brings much more plausibility to the character.  Rachel Dawes represents the perfect life that Bruce Wayne dreams of, the life that he feels Batman will give him.  So is he in love with Rachel, or what she represents?     Somehow, Gotham City's new district attorney, Harvey Dent, seems to be the answer to all these questions.  Batman fans know where this is headed.  The Harvey Dent storyline is a fan favorite, set-up in Tim Burton's \\"Batman,\\" in which Dent was played by Billy Dee Williams, and then executed in a gruesome fashion in Joel Schumacher's dismal \\"Batman Forever,\\" in which Dent was played by Tommy Lee Jones.  Here, however, the storyline is beautifully adapted for the big screen by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, with whom he wrote the screenplay.  Nolan emphasizes the idealistic and optimisticfriendship between Dent, Batman, and Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), especially its tragic consequences for the three of them.  Aaron Eckhart is perfectly cast: he has a genuine, all-American strength that's just what the role requires.  Eckhart's Harvey Dent is to Gotham City as Barack Obama is to America - which makes Dent's tragic fate hit audiences even harder.  Eckhart's only previous acclaim-garnering performance was in 2005's \\"Thank You for Smoking\\"; if \\"The Dark Knight\\" is any indication, he's one of the most undervalued actors in Hollywood.       But not many people have seen \\"The Dark Knight\\" for Christian Bale, or for Maggie Gyllenhaal, or for Aaron Eckhart.  They're seeing it for Heath Ledger, whose death - ghastly as it sounds - has aided the hype surrounding this film in ways that nothing else could.  It's especially bizarre, and, its own way, awesome, that Ledger's final performance is as a character so chilling and unforgettable as the Joker.  Last played by Jack Nicholson in 1989, the Joker is Batman's nemesis, and may be the most famous of all comic book villains.  Nicholson's Joker made audiences a little uncomfortable at times, but for the most part, he was a blast, adding all the over-the-top comic relief Burton's film needed.  Ledger's Joker is a whole different character.  He is the Joker as comic book fans know him, a horrifyingly unpredictable, sadistic, enigmatic serial killer.  Ledger's Joker has long, gangly hair.  His makeup is gradually rubbing off.  He has an Irish grin (if you don't know what that is, look it up).  And Ledger's performance, well - those who say Ledger carries the film are missing the point, because there's so much more to the film, but it is certainly the highlight of the picture.  It is brilliant.  It is sensational.  If it doesn't win Ledger a posthumous Best Supporting Actor Oscar, then the film industry will see its equivalent of the L.A. riots of the 1990s.  Which is to say that infuriated fans will post nasty messages on Internet message boards.  But still - something to be avoided.     Rounding out the cast are the returning vets.  Morgan Freeman is as delightful as ever.  Freeman's character, Wayne Enterprises C.E.O. Lucius Fox, has a sense of moral absolutism which is invaluable when Bruce Wayne needs grounding.  Even more delightful is Michael Caine, whose warm yet cheeky portrayal of Alfred, Wayne's butler/father figure, adds some much-needed comic relief to the film.     Oh, and when I write \\"much-needed comic relief,\\" I mean it.  \\"The Dark Knight\\" is not called \\"The Dark Knight\\" for no reason.  Otherwise, it would be called \\"The Bright Knight,\\" and that just doesn't have the same grit.  Its title has a double meaning.  On the one hand, it is Batman's nickname, the \\"Dark Knight,\\" which is particularly fitting given some of the choices he's forced to make in this film.  On the other hand, it refers to the period of time depicted in this film as a \\"dark night,\\" so to speak.  This is a dark, dark film.  At one point, Harvey Dent uses the old saying, \\"The night is darkest just before the dawn.\\"  That's the crucial line of the film.  If \\"Batman Begins\\" was dusk, then the inevitable third film must be dawn, because \\"The Dark Knight\\" is certainly midnight.  Hope prevails at its end, because, thankfully, hope springs eternal, but for the most part, this film is black and bleak.  This film makes one feel like hope and optimism are futile emotions.  Isn't there a similar feeling running through our country right now?     Chris Nolan's last film, \\"The Prestige,\\" was a spectacular piece of filmmaking.  I thought it was his masterwork.  But without a question, \\"The Dark Knight\\" trumps it.  Nolan is at the top of his game.  His style shines through the film, but never rises above the character, a problem which plagued the previous Batfilms.   Instead, Nolan's style, dark, gritty, and heavy, blends with the character.  Nolan and Batman are a perfect pair.  Shot-for-shot, thefilm is perfect.  Despite its two and a half hour runtime, which will be heaven for some and a bit arduous for others, there is not a wasted moment.  This film deserves a Best Film Editing Oscar.  In all honesty, it deserves a shipload of Oscars.  The chances of it receiving them are pretty slim.     Maybe, though, the Academy will rise up and realize what they have in their hands: a masterpiece.  It's a masterpiece of superhero films, staying true to the classic storylines, but also fully realizing the depth and psychological complexities of each and every character.  It has none of the self-consciousness which peeped out in Sam Raimi's \\"Spider-Man\\" films (though that was fitting, considering their socially-awkward hero), and none of the lack of ambition which plagued Bryan Singer's \\"Superman Returns.\\"  And it's a masterpiece of cinema, period.  \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a film in the classical sense.  Its storylines are captivating, intriguing, grand, and clever.  It's technically flawless.  It has a historical relevance which many seem to be overlooking.  The mood of the film, its messages and observations, are so clearly a product of the troubled times we're living in.  Audiences are connecting with it, which is why it's now the second-biggest film of all-time domestically.  Lastly, it's a film very representative of America, both from a citizen's perspective and from the perspective of an outsider (F.Y.I., director Nolan is British).  Michael Caine said it best: \\"Superman is the way America sees itself.  Batman is the way the world sees America.\\"     If that's so, we have a long and dark path ahead of us.  But at its end, \\"The Dark Knight\\" suggests that there is only one way to go, and that's forward, no matter the cost, no matter the stakes.  It may not be a pleasant journey, but fortunately, moviegoers have films like this to help us on our way.
B00154GEFU|2.0|I ususally don't give bad reviews, but I had to sound off on this.  I am a big Asia fan.  I stuck by them when the put out Keepin' The Summer Alive.  I was glad to see their reunion and resurgence over the past few years.  I saw them in concert last year, and they blew me away. I even liked both ICON albums.  When I heard they were recording I was overjoyed.  Then I heard the album.  As one British music critic put it (and he is usually very fair in his reviews) - \\"this album makes Air Supply sound metal!\\"  There is no spark here.  The album hardly rocks.  Where is Carl Palmer's great driving playing and exciting drum fills?  Where are Steve Howe's usually mind-blowing guitar solos?  Do these guys think they are Chicago circa 1983?  that's what this album sounds like.  Very dissapointing

I'm not talking about the Manolos, the Louis Vuitton, or the Dior (that's not \\"product-placement,\\" that's love of haute couture) ... I am talking about the ubiquitous Vitamin Waters, the close-up of Carrie's new Sprint phone, the shopping-bags from Bluefly (and if you've never shopped Bluefly, you should know it's a \\"designer outlet\\" ... as in last year's Prada-rejects ... decidedly not \\"Carrie\\"). It is insulting to be bombarded with these pedestrian (if not \\"bargain-basement\\") items that have little relevance to the work. Take note, Michael Patrick King: your audience picks-up on these things. Try a more subtle approach in the future.    Now, steady yourself for the real criticism: the writing. Once clever and witty, the film adopts an entirely low-brow tone. Gone are the double-entendres and witty retorts ... instead King has given us only the basest of conversation. (Without any nuance in the script, Samantha becomes especially abhorrent and Charlotte, a bit dim-witted). In the most unforgivable moment, the writing sinks to an extended \\"bodily-function\\" joke (no spoilers). It is bizarre and debasing. (When Miranda had her own mishap while changing Brady's diaper, it was funny and real ... when it happens between adult women, well, it seems like something a teenage boy would write). Yuck. (And, I'm not entirely convinced that one's more cosmopolitan friends would find it amusing).    And while I'm not opposed to \\"low-brow\\" (hey, I dig Will Farrell films), I AM opposed to hack. Here's what I learned from King's \\"illuminating\\" writing: 1.) children repeat words they hear adults say, 2.) children are messy eaters, 3.) Jennifer Hudson is well endowed 4.) and \\"illegal Cuban\\" cigars are the best. Thank you for repeatedly stating the obvious in the most stilted, awkward manner possible. And all the ado with the \\"love\\" key-chain ... gag. Oh, and King, the auction-scene ... it's been done a THOUSAND times! (See: The Cosby Show: \\"The Auction\\"). That PAINFULLY PREDICTABLE moment ranks as the second-most unforgivable moment of the work. Bottom-line, I was struck breathless by the surface-writing (to the point of absolute frustration).    Writing aside, King's struggle to transition from television to film was evident. The direction and framing were fairly sloppy (occasionally, I was unsure where King wanted my eye to focus). And the \\"Honeymoon segment\\" ... I was instantly catapulted back to \\"bad\\" on-location sitcoms ... the shots in Mexico reminded me of \\"The Brady Bunch: Hawaii Bound\\": bad color, very bad sound, horrendous approach all-together.    Had this film been thoughtful and fun, the TWO HOURS AND TWENTY-EIGHT minutes would have been a joy. Instead, every second that elapsed destroyed the memory of a genuinely great television series. (And, it must be said that this was not a problem with the actors -- who gave their best. This was a problem with script/direction/production). At this epic run-time, why didn't the cast and crew just invest in a reunion season??!! (They could have slowed-down the production a little and genuinely focused on an honest, compelling story).    This film currently has a giant \\"SPLAT!\\" at Rottentomatoes ... these are professionals who gave it a 54% approval-rating as of this hour. Many former-fans will not allow themselves to view King's work as anything but pleasant nostalgia ... many will find themselves laughing at the half-hearted jokes and empty-minded comments. But critical viewers (as in, the \\"smart-viewers\\" that the show once attracted) may walk away angry. REALLY ANGRY.
B00030DEQE|5.0|I installed this in a three year old Dell Dimension 9100 running Vista 32-bit Ultimate.  It works great and the drivers installed automatically.  My unofficial performance tests indicate that this card truly delivers gigabit transfer rates.  I previously installed a [[ASIN:B00023433U TRENDnet Gigabit PCI Adapter]] in the same machine and I couldn't get the drivers to load properly.  Considering the simplicity and minimal labor required to install this NIC, it was definitely worth a few extra bucks over the lower-cost brands.
B000022TSH|5.0|Finally; a crime noir that works.  After watching quite a few lackluster film noirs I decided to revisit `Chinatown' to see if it still held up as the greatest film noir of all time and, quite honestly, it does.  Polanski gets everything right with this one, creating a film that is stunning, captivating, dark and brooding while always maintaining a level of hope that helps glue the audience to their seats (even if that hope is crushed in the devastating finale).  There are few films that have been able to capture this aura, the most recent being `L.A. Confidential'.<br /><br />The crime noir is something difficult to master, but Polanski masters is effortlessly.<br /><br />`Chinatown' revolves around private detective Jake Gittes who is hired by a woman claiming to be a jilted wife to follow her husband and see if he is indeed having an affair.  When the husband turns up dead and she winds up not actually being the man's wife things start to get complicated.  The man's real wife, Evelyn, shows up asking what business Jake had with her husband, and as Jake digs deeper into her husband's murder he uncovers the dirty secrets lurking around every corner.  As `Chinatown' spirals to a close and more is revealed it shifts from a pacifiable crime noir into a certifiable classic.<br /><br />The script is brilliantly crafted, allowing the audience to sink into the grit of the situation with ease, building slowing on its foundation until the dramatic and explosive conclusion.  Much must be accredited to Polanski who just pulls from all angles and draws the audience in with each and every frame.  The murky, gritty feel to the film elevates the material and makes the audience feel a part of the action, and Polanski's resulting vision is one of beautiful demise.<br /><br />A great facet of this film is the marvelous performances by the entire cast, most notably Jack Nicholson.  Nicholson is a brilliant actor, I think we all can agree there, but there are times when he falls into self mimicry and winds up just parodying himself in his films.  `Chinatown' is one of those times when he steps away from his public persona and just delivers a well rounded and fantastically crafted character.  J.J. `Jake' Gittes is one of Jack's greatest cinematic accomplishments and certainly one of his greatest performances.  Jack is given some ample help though, in the form of Faye Dunaway and John Huston, both of whom bring so much to this film.  Dunaway is dynamite here, really stakeing her claim as Nicholson's equal, and as the film draws to a close and her character is finally fleshed out to the full she emotes so much genuine emotion she helps that transition work.  Huston is delicious here, seriously.  His performance is what the movies is all about.  I'm really shocked he was passed over of the Oscar nomination when in all actuality I would have handed him the win.  He has the perfect mixture of parental protection and selfish indulgence to make his character not only believable but engrossing.<br /><br />`Chinatown' is filled to the brim with enough of everything to keep the audience glued in anticipation.  The script is marvelous, tightly woven and intricate, always keeping you guessing and wanting more.  The acting is superb, truly elevating each and every scene and the mood set is pitch-perfect, and it never wanes.  Polanski should be lauded for this masterpiece.  It's a shame it was released the same year as Coppola's `The Godfather, Part II' for both films are brilliant, perfect even, but there is no topping the magnificence that is Coppola.self mimicry and winds up just parodying himself in his films.  `Chinatown' is one of those times when he steps away from his public persona and just delivers a well rounded and fantastically crafted character.

B0015XHX7O|2.0|This is one of the worst sounding LPs I have ever come across. I'm not attacking the album itself, it's still the classic we know and love, but something went horribly wrong with the mastering of this new vinyl edition. It's unlistenable. It sounds muffled and distorted. I am so disappointed. Stick with the vintage LP releases and don't mess with these new pressings.
B000URDEB0|4.0|Apart from Sabbath's Ozzy > Dio shift, I'm hard pressed to remember about change of vocalists within a band that has caused so much ruckus.  However, as with that situation, there is considerably more to Nightwish than the singer -- and mostly that's keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, who composes virtually all the music.  Whoever is singing, this is clearly Tuomas's band and music. Whether this is his finest hour yet is, perhaps, debatable ... but  if you want symphonic metal glory (if you don't, why are you reading Nightwish reviews? ;)) then there're no unleaspant changes in store on that front.  After all, what more can we ask for an album opener than a 14-minute ueber-indulgent workout that must have left more than a few members of the supporint London Symphony Orchestra mopping their brows -- or at least reaching for their ear plugs?  Then, on the other side of things, the first single \\"Amaranth\\" is wickedly catchy. What's not to like?  (Well, apart from the subtle-as-a-reindeer-trampling \\"this is about firing Tarja\\" lyrics on a few tracks ....)    Of course, what everyone want to know about on this album is \\"How's the new singer?\\".  For my part, though I don't think Annete Olzon has anything like Tarja Turunen unquestionably impressive pipes ... I think I actually like the band better with her.  (There: I've just enraged millions of already wrathful Tarja fans!).  No, but seriously -- with past Nightwish albums, I often felt my fairly high tolerance for outrageous bombast was being seriously strained by Tarja's self-consciously operatic vocals after a few songs.  IMO, Olzon's admittedly more conventional rock/pop style gets me a lot farther before I need to have a lie down and listen to some Motorhead to restore my equilibrium.    So: I think this album successfully maneuvers Nightwish into their \\"new singer era\\". The music and playing are solidly good, I think they may the right choice in picking a different kind of singer going forward, and lest we all forget the rest of the band (as plenty of people seem to do), I think the addition of bassist Marco Hietala a few albums back is continuing to pay dividends (besides his \\"spirit of metal\\" sensibilities, he pens the excellently folky \\"The Islander\\" here).  Anyway, they've certainly got my attention for the future. Bring it on!
B0000AK7AB|5.0|I know, I know; very bold statement, but I challenge you to watch `Babe' and not draw the same conclusion.  When I first saw `Babe' all those years ago I was like ten and I adored it.  But here is the true testament to the brilliance that is `Babe'; I watched it just this past week and LOVED it.<br /><br />Yes, `Babe' ages very, very well.  It is pure family entertainment that shines brightly, giving the audience laughs and tears and heartwarming moments of beauty and peace.  `Babe' is a monumental achievement in the world of family (or children's) entertainment for it reaches a level of overall satisfaction without ever having to spice the film with adult humor or forced maturity.  This is a children's film that appeals to adults without ever catering to adults, and that is a feat in itself.  Unlike `Shrek' and recent so-called children's films that have followed, `Babe' never goes over the child's head yet it always maintains the adult's attention.<br /><br />`Babe' tells the story a young orphan pig who escapes slaughter by displaying his ability to herd sheep.  His owner, Arthur Hoggett enters Babe into a sheep-herding contest despite everyone's disapproval.<br /><br />The beauty within `Babe' is not found in the plot (which is pretty simple) but in the underlying emotional connection between Hoggett and Babe and, well, Babe and everyone.  It really shows that family can never be defined and that you can be loved and show love to any and everyone, regardless of race or even species.  At its heart Babe is a story about acceptance and love.<br /><br />James Cromwell is amazing as Farmer Hoggett.  There is a beautiful scene where he nurses Babe back to health after a night spent in the rain and he does this little jig to try and cheer him up and his performance is so sincere and so genuine, which must be hard to muster when working with a mechanical pig.  It's a wonder to me why he didn't win that Oscar, I mean Spacey was good (albeit nominated for the wrong performance) but of the final five Cromwell was by far the most deserving.  The voiceover actors are all flawless as well and truly add to the cartoon-like vibe of the film.<br /><br />In the end there are few films this heartfelt and moving, at least in this genre.  It is not a sappy saccharine type film that plays too heavy on the heartstrings but this is a pure and emotionally balanced film that manages to appear real and raw despite its very fairytale like prose.ive Cromwell was by far the most deserving.

031606792X|1.0|Breaking Dawn by Stephenie Meyer is the final book in the Twilight series, and it is a major disappointment. Through three books we've followed Bella in her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob. Edward and Bella have made a deal: he will make her a vampire if she marries him as a human and they have a real honeymoon before she is changed. The book up to that point follows Meyer's previous books, but then everything goes horribly wrong. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!<br /><br />Bella becomes pregnant with Edward's baby and is forced to drink human blood in order to feed the little monster that's breaking her ribs with its superhuman kicks. Honestly, I don't want to go into the plot any more than that. What Meyer had created in the first three books, she destroyed in Breaking Dawn. The birth scene was more gory and gruesome than anything that Stephen King could dream of. Trust me, I've read nearly everything the man has written, and I had a hard time keeping my eyes on the page. For an excellent breakdown of why the book doesn't work, read Eventide's review on Amazon. This is what it felt like to me. Meyer sat down and decided that in order for every single character to be happy, she needed to write outlandish plotlines in order to make that happen. So Bella gets Edward and a baby without ever suffering through new vampire syndrome. Plus she can still have a relationship with her parents, and no war is declared between the vamps and the werewolves, in fact they're best buddies due to Meyer's manipulations. Finishing the story, I didn't feel the sense of satisfaction that I had at the end of Deathly Hallows. I felt used and angry that I had wasted so much of my time reading the entire series. It feels as though Meyer intends to write more books about the family, but I, for one, have no interest in reading any further in the Twilight world.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been a fan of taebo for many years and was looking for a change.  I purchased this DVD on a whim and wow what a workout.  The level one workout is only 20 minutes long, but I'm sweating at the end and feeling like I just worked every muscle in my body.  I can already notice a difference in the way my clothes fit.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone in a fitness rut looking for a new plan of action.  Can't wait to move to level 2.  Jillian is very motivating and the moves are not complicated, just love this workout.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|In my humble opinion The Gaslight Anthem are the most exciting band I have has the good fortune of hearing in the last 20 years. The raw emotion, the fantastic storytelling and excellent music combine to take you to another place. The mix of rock, punk, blues, country (you name it they have it here) creates a sound that is just addictive. Their previous releases were simply sublime and the 59 Sound just makes their passage to greatness all the more certain. If there is any justice left in the music industry they are going to be huge! 5 stars, no question!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|There is a lot going on in `Love Actually'; a whole lot.  That is a good thing, for that means that there is more to love, and love I do, for `Love Actually' is kind of like the ultimate romantic comedy.  The film revolves around eight couples (not always in the most conventional sense) as they strive for love during the holiday season.<br /><br />To get into every aspect of this film individually would take too much time and space, plus it would take away from the whole surprise and joyous mystery of the film, but I will touch try and outline the plot a little.<br /><br />At the center of the film there is the young prime minister who has become smitten with his caterer.  His sister is having trouble in her marriage, for her husband has fallen prey to the young office temptress.  Her best friend Daniel is dealing with the death of his wife and raising her son (his stepson) Sam, not to mention finding some solace.  Then there is Jamie, who is going through a rough patch in his love life when he catches his girlfriend in the arms of another man.  Young lovers Juliet and Peter are trying to get their marriage off to a good start, and Sarah is trying to find love while juggling other responsibilities.  Add to this a washed up rockstar on the verge of a comeback and workmates (working in very compromising positions) and a young Brit who dreams of American girls and you have, in a nutshell, `Love Actually'.<br /><br />You'd think that this may be a little much, but it works, really, really well.  Each couple actually finds some sort of closure to their story, even if it's not the typical happy ending we are hoping for (I'm looking at you Sarah).<br /><br />What makes this film work so beautifully is above all else the script, penned by first time director Richard Curtis (who made a name for himself writing `Four Wedding's and a Funeral').  He wonderfully shifts the focus of the film from character to character without ever losing the audience or taking away from his characters.  Each group or couple or individual is given their opportunity to shine and engage us.  Sure, some couples are given more scenery to chew, but the audience will never feel jilted in any way.<br /><br />And then there are the brilliant comedic (and dramatic) performances by the entire cast.  Truly everyone is outstanding and to single anyone out in particular seems almost cruel, but there is no denying that Bill Nighy steals the show as Billy Mack, the washed up rocker who is battling the popular boy band for billboard sales.  His comedic timing is brilliant.  Other actors who shine are Colin Firth and Liam Neeson and Laura Linney who all capture the loneliness that comes from abandonment and or responsibility and they do so magically (especially Neeson and Linney).  Emma Thompson is marvelous as Karen, wife to Rickman's Harry; the husband with a wondering eye.  Hugh Grant is always superb, and Martine McCutcheon matches his humor beautifully.  I know I'm missing some, but I would be just foolish to miss Thomas Sangster who turns out a beautifully well rounded and sincere child performance that captures his youth and not a Hollywood fabrication of childlike maturity.<br /><br />As the films final frame comes into view the audience feels fulfilled, albeit a little stuffed, but it's a good kind of stuffed; like the feeling you get after holiday dinner.  There's a smile on your face, a little food on your chin and this overwhelmingly warm feeling in the pit of your stomach that lets you know everything is alright.or individual is given their opportunity to shine and engage us.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Note: The following review may possibly contain minor plot points or spoilers    Before entering in to the theater on Wall-E's release I thought that Pixar was one of the greater animation studios of the new millennium; after seeing Wall-E, not only am I convinced that Pixar is the greatest modern animation studio, but perhaps one of the most talented and treasured film companies in the history of cinema, with writer-director Andrew Stanton at the head of the pack. Stanton has not only managed to create a technical marvel, with Wall-E pushing the boundaries of computer animation technology to the limits, but also a work of pure art that contains more emotion and character than this entire years worth of movies put together.     The film starts off on a simultaneously sweet and sour note: The opening frames reveal the gorgeous backdrop of special galaxies and stars, with music from the movie-musical Hello-Dolly! overlapping it all in a sugary visual treat. Not seconds later, the camera traverses space to slowly close in on the planet Earth, which some 700 years in to the future has gained a sickly green tint to it as well as an orbital atmosphere of pure garbage. Further zooming reveals a desolated city (New York, maybe?) its buildings and bridges rotted way. The entire opening is vey reminiscent of the recent I Am Legend, except much, much more ruined. It is however, technically beautiful; the images are so photorealistic that you're amazed that they've been generated by computer.     The only remnants of humanity are monstrous skyscrapers of compacted trash and billboards aplenty advertising the bright and colorful, yet somehow ominous company known as Buy n' Large, a thinly veiled Wal-Mart clone. And, of course, Wall-E itself.    Wall-E is far more than a mere 'it', however. Through hundreds of nuanced and heartfelt animation quirks, as well as the \\"voice\\" given by Ben Burtt, Star-Wars techie and creator of another famed beeping robot named R2-D2, Wall-E has beenimbued with enough life to fill three-dozen cheap summer kids flicks (Space Chimps, really?), all without ever saying more than two or three actual words. It is this achievement that Pixar should be commended for.     Wall-E has been operating for centuries, long after his other Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class counterparts have shut down or broken apart, scouring the wastelands of earth and compacting the land's garbage in to neat little cubes that are stacked into the previously mentioned monoliths of refuse.     It is a long and lonely job, with the little robot's only companion being a spunky little cockroach. Wall-E has over the years collected an impressive amount of junk with which he passes the time, including lighters, toys, clothes, spare parts, and an old VHS copy of Hello Dolly!, which is Wall-E's instructor in the ways of life, love, and keenly choreographed dance. Indeed, Wall-E gazes upon two lovers holding hands and the look in his binocular eyes is both heartbreaking and beautiful.     It all changes however, when a beautiful (and presumably female) robot from the human colony in space arrives; her name is EVE. Despite here tendencies to blow up anything that so much as flutters in the breeze, Wall-E is smitten at first sight, and EVE comes to eventually share those feelings. After taking note of a very unique possession of Wall-E's however, EVE reports back to the Earth ship axiom and is whisked away back in to space. Wall-E, being as devoted and golden-hearted as he is, follows her into the unknown, and it is there that the movie really gets going, with Wall-E and EVE taking part in an adventure with the fate of humanity itself in the balance. Characters like the Captain of the Axiom (voiced by Jeff Garlin) appear to flesh out the film's plot, as well as a gaggle of amusing \\"rogue\\" robots that aide Wall-E and EVE in their quest.     As the movie develops, however, the leading characters' romance becomes the core of the movie, with Wall-E and EVE's love being one of the few genuinely lovely and convincing romances of recent cinema. The touching moments Wall-E shares with EVE in his workshop, as well as their first \\"kiss\\", preceding a marvelous dance through space highlight a relationship that tugs at the heartstrings and moistens the eyes far more than movies like Fool's Gold or What Happens in Vegas. The romance between the two leads is the very soul of the movie, and could not have been more well executed.     The film is gorgeous to boot: With colors and images that dazzle, and linger with you long after the film is over.  Films like No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood, as beautiful as they are, seem to revel in the gloom of browns and blacks. Wall-E, on the other is vibrant and alive, turning even the beginning's post-apocalyptic wasteland in to a marvel. The further adventures on the human colony ship, the Axiom, juxtapose it so well that it almost seems like two different films.    I haven't even mentioned the wonderful score composed by Thomas Newman, who is accompanied by some fantastic guest-compososers,  which is ambient and beautiful and perfectly accompanies eveything that I love about the movie.    The biggest surprise of Wall-E, however, would be its surprising amount of maturity. Wall-E deals with themes of pollution, rampant consumerism, societal complacency and obesity, media desensitization, and other themes that would frankly fly over a child's head. Kids will see a world full of people who are humorously fat and happy; older members of the audience, however, will see a society that tells of a future not centuries ahead of us but perhaps only decades. The overblown laziness and rampant consumerism is evident already today, and the notion of Wall-E's future being so similar is funny yes, but also a touch unnerving.    It is for this reason that I hold Wall-E in such high esteem: It is a heartfelt work of inarguable art that not only entertains up the wazoo but holds enoughconscience and commentary to get even the most casual of moviegoer thinking about the future. It is beautiful and it is heartbreaking. It is funny and it is also a tad scary. It two robots teaching humanity the very meaning of being human, as well as learning the meaning of true love themselves. It made me laugh, it made me (almost) cry. It has the distinction of being Pixar's best movie, as wells as the hands down best movie of the year (so far); an almost perfect, if not completely perfect summer movie that kids and adults will almost assuredly love.    And it is also one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.
B00005176F|4.0|Blur has a way of writing lyrics that elevates them above most bands. They are intelligent, ironic, and most importantly, funny. I've always related them to Weezer, based on lyrics more than music style. This collection gets the job done as far as providing a solid and complete collection of their radio hits. The songs themselves are all excellent, but they feel strange in the order presented. I agree with another reviewer that they were better when part of their original albums, in their original context. Maybe it's just because I enjoy listening to complete albums more than singles, but I prefer their original albums to this collection.<br /><br />If you're only interested in owning their radio singles, give this a try. Otherwise, buy their original albums.

6305090564|2.0|When I first saw `Deep Rising' I was young and foolish and I thought that it was the coolest horror monster adventure movie out there.  Then, recently, I saw it again and had all these awesome memories of what was going to be seen, yet it seemed like a catastrophic failure to me the second time around.  None of the chills were there, the special effects, while decent, were not the crazy eye-poppers I remembered.  The acting was stiff (on most accounts at least) and the script was dreadful.  It was as if I was watching a completely different movie than the one I remembered with such fondness.<br /><br />The film follows a group of hijackers who bust into a luxury ocean liner expecting to strip it of its valuables only to uncover that only a handful of passengers are still alive and the ship is infested with these tentacle looking monster things that are draining the life out of the humans on board.  Armed with some heavy artillery the surviving men and woman (a con artist who happened to survive through a stroke of circumstantial luck) decide to take on the beast in order to escape.<br /><br />The problems with `Deep Rising' lay in Sommers' hands.  He wrote and directed this debacle.  There is absolutely no originality to be found within the film, at all, and that is disappointing because it could have been really interesting and or exciting.  Instead it comes off rather boring and predictable.  The acting is atrocious on most fronts (Treat Williams actually turns out a decent performance and Famke Janssen tries to save her character from inevitable clich&eacute;s) which is mostly chock up to the horrendous script and dialog they are given to work with.  I know that a film in this genre is filled to the brim with one-liners (which I'm never really fond of) but these ones rarely land right.<br /><br />In the end `Deep Rising' comes off as a stupid, mildly entertaining distraction from better more fulfilling films.  Sure, there is some excitement value here but really, why bother?  There are many films that have more going for them; films that are original and exciting and entertaining.  `Deep Rising' just doesn't stack up, it doesn't offer the audience enough of anything to sustain them or warrant their adoration.

B000ZBPQEO|5.0|I can only echo the extravagant praise of my fellow Amazon.com reviewers.  This box, which contains literally everything Karajan recorded for EMI in Vienna, London and Berlin from the 1940's through the early '80's, and its companion volume, which features all of Karajan's opera/vocal recordings for this label, provide a unique opportunity to hear, enjoy and assess the developing career of a great artist. Karajan was arguably the most important conductor since Furtw&auml;ngler and Toscanini, and we are fortunate that he made so many recordings on various labels.  The EMI recordings, many of them from relatively early in his career, are arguably his finest from an interpretive point of view.  It is quite instructive to compare the leaner and more incisive sound Karajan elicited from his ensembles in the earlier phase of his career, with the more bloated textures he created with the BPO (and, to a lesser extent, from the VPO) during his later period.  Though no admirer of von Karajan would want to be without his greatest efforts for DG, the early EMI recordings convey an elemental vigor and cogency that are only fitfully recaptured in his DG recordings.  Interestingly, many of the later EMI recordings included here (such as the Sibelius symphonies from the late stereo/early digital era) are superior both sonically and interpretively to his DG recordings from the same period, further confirming my hunch that Karajan did his best work for EMI.<br /><br />Of course any anthology of this kind will have its ups and downs, both from an interpretive and a sonic point of view.  So, for instance the heady excitement of his early Mozart recordings with the VPO is somewhat dulled by indifferent monaural recordings. Nor is  Karajan's first Beethoven cycle with the Philharmonia as perceptive as his classic 1963 cycle with the BPO for DG, superbly played though it is.  But one should not make too much of these comparisons in light of the consistently high standard of excellence found in this 88-CD set, to say nothing of its status as one of the most extraordinary bargains ever offered by a major label (less than two dollars per CD from many sellers on this website).  Certainly there are many great performances here, including at least four which in my estimation have never been surpassed: a monaural Vaughan Williams \\"Tallis Fantasia\\" and Britten \\"Frank Bridge Variations\\" with the Philharmonia, a Bruckner Seventh with the BPO from 1971 and an early digital Sibelius Sixth, also with the BPO. Some of the early VPO performances are particularly incandescent (Beethoven's Fifth and Ninth, for instance).<br /><br />In addition to symphonic repertoire this box also contains numerous overtures and lighter fare, all done to a turn.  Concertante works abound, featuring such estimable soloists as Dennis Brain (in his famous account of the Mozart Horn Concerti), Dinu Lipatti (in Mozart's Concerto no. 21), Alexis Weissenberg (in the complete Beethoven Piano Concertos), Oistrakh Richter and Rostropovich (in the Beethoven \\"Triple Concerto\\"), James Galway (in the first Mozart flute concerto), etc.  But of course it would be impossible to list everything of merit in this set.  I have owned at one time or another, in various formats, about half of these recordings.  I am gradually making my way through those with which I am unfamiliar, and am finding that my appreciation of Karajan is enhanced with virtually every new acquaintance.  I am also impressed by the quality of the digital transfers of material which I had previously heard only on LP (or in previous CD incarnations).  I'm not certain whether EMI has gone to the trouble of securing new remasterings in every case, but the sound seems better focused overall, with minimal tape hiss and a better sense of space around the instruments than before.  Of course, nothing much can be done to improve the dry string timbres in some of the earliest mono recordings.<br /><br />In sum, then, this collection is unmissable-- whether you are a Karajan fan or a listener interested in the history of conducting and  twentieth-century orchestral performance practice.  Since the range of repertoire is extraordinarily broad--from Vivaldi to Bart&oacute;k-- this box could also serve as something like a comprehensive introduction to the standard repertoire for a beginner in classical music.  Purchase it as a gift for a music student, or donate one to your local public or college library.<br /><br />And while you're at it, don't forget to order the companion box containing dozens of operas ranging from Mozart to Strauss, plus a number of choral masterpieces (Bach Mass in B Minor, Beethoven Missa Solemnis, Haydn's Seasons, Brahms's German Requiem).  You can obtain both boxes for less than it will probably cost you to keep your SUV on the road for a month.  Walk, ride a bicycle or carpool--and then save the money for this extraordinary opportunity before it fades from view.le-- whether you are a Karajan fan or a listener interested in the history of conducting and  twentieth-century orchestral performance practice.

0525950079|3.0|Part of the allure of \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", the book that preceded this one, is the originality of it.  This one seems like a slightly paler version of the first book.  It takes place in the same English town, Kingsbridge, and has dastardly lords, poor but honest peasants, and clergy who jostle for position and power.  There is plenty of action, but to me the characters were not as interesting or compelling as the ones in the first book.  It was clear that the peasants would be exploited by the upper classes, so I just gritted my teeth and suffered through the cruelties knowing that eventually all would be well.  If I had read this book first, I might have had a slightly different opinion of it, but it did seem like a less compelling version of the first one.
6305657947|2.0|Pierce Brosnan has this endearing sensuality that draws you to him, no matter what role he's playing.  I'm a man and I can admit that without hesitation.  That factor is really the only thing that saves `The Thomas Crown Affair' from being nothing more than passable entertainment.  In other words, if it weren't for Brosnan I would have turned the film off almost as soon as it began, or at least the moment Russo walked onto the screen (more on her later).  But no, I didn't.  I watched the film in its entirety, and while it is not dreadful it is far less than worthy of your time and attention.<br /><br />Now I have not seen the original, so I cannot compare the two (the reviews say that this one is superior, so I'm not in a rush to check out the original), but this `remake' definitely has the feel of a remake.  You know, the way that remakes always feel (not always but most of the time) like they are missing something.  This feels like it's missing something.<br /><br />The film follows Thomas Crown, a wealthy businessman (millionaire at that) who is growing bored and so he decides to stage a robbery at the local museum.  Catherine Banning is the insurance investigator hired to aid the police investigation.  She immediately suspects Crown despite the department's disbelief, and so she targets him, and attempts to seduce him.  Crown on the flip side is working her, from every angle in fact.  In the end it boils down to a `does he love me, is he using me, should I rat him out, should I follow him' scenario, which quite frankly grows old very soon.<br /><br />The initial robbery scene is expertly staged and choreographed; it's just a shame that it's the only remotely exciting scene in the film.<br /><br />The acting is very hit or miss.  Pierce is great, as usual.  He is seductive and mysterious and enticing.  He makes you want to know everything about him.  Rene Russo is a major miss for me.  From the second the walked onto the screen it was as if she was trying way too hard.  I don't get the admiration for her performance, for it comes off rather cartoonish rather than grounded.  She is very over-the-top and at times unbearable.  Faye Dunaway (who starred in the original I hear) is also very over-the-top.  Her character is a mere cameo performance and so she is forgivably over-the-top, but nonetheless she is far from good.  I am not a fan of Denis Leary, but he works his character well enough and doesn't take away from the film at all.  He doesn't add anything either, but that's a different story.<br /><br />In the end `The Thomas Crown Affair' has its moments, however few they may be, but the overall appeal of the film is lacking for me.  It's predictable and clich&eacute;d and rather dense.  The dialog is choppy and at times you can see the actors choking on their words, and the formulaic plot (right down to the `omg you're cheating on me, wait no you're not') can be irritating.

B00000JNO2|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd's [[ASIN:B000002PAP Gimme Back My Bullets]] (1976) is the original band's one and only album with a two-guitar lineup, instead of the usual three. Guitarist Ed King left the group during their Torture Tour prior to the recording sessions and had yet to be replaced by Steve Gaines. Mostly, it was Allen Collins who stepped up to the plate for this album and, along with Gary Rossington and Ronnie Van Zant, wrote this collection of solid southern rock songs that includes several Skynyrd classics (Collins co-wrote seven of the album's eight original songs). Collins and Rossington also handle the added guitar responsibilities with no problem.<br /><br />The songs include some of Ronnie Van Zant's most personal lyrics. The heavy touring and hard partying seemed to bring out a weary need to escape the craziness and keep the greedy cut-throat metropolitan world that he didn't trust at bay.<br /><br />Roll Gyspy Roll:<br />Riding on a Greyhound, countin' those white lines<br />Destination I don't know and I'm feelin' like I'm dyin'<br />Well, ten years on this road, my it took it's toll<br />But the man with the plan says the band's got to go<br /><br />All I Can Do Is Write About It:<br />And Lord, I can't make any changes<br />All I can do is write 'em in a song<br />I can see the concrete slowly creepin'<br />Lord, take me and mine before that comes<br /><br />The title track and Searching are the most recognizable songs on the album, and both have become classics that are essential to the Lynyrd Skynyrd legend.

Cales' I Got The Same Old Blues is included, and Every Mothers Son, Trust and Cry For The Bad Man are solid rockers with lyrics that follow the generally disillusioned and defiant theme of the album. Everything here measures up to the Lynyrd Skynyrd standard.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002PAP Gimme Back My Bullets]] is a solid Skynyrd album even though it sold less than the other albums by the original lineup. Of course, any Lynyrd Skynyrd album with Ronnie Van Zant at the helm is a classic, and is essential to any Skynyrd collection.

B0017MO10U|5.0|A fan since the beginning I've seen every show there was..loved the final 2 hour wrap up of StarGate, even if you never watched a show, this would be fun for some who like Sci-Fi!  I enjoyed several of the fun things Ben Browder slipped in while taking Command of the starship... and the fact that many of our past \\"bad guys\\" come back for one last peek.. Love owning this... nothing like a rainy day with some snacks and a great Stargate to watch!
B001BN1VIA|1.0|Oh lookie!!!!  It's yet another release from marketing genius Ian Anderson!    MY GOD.  How many different versions of your albums do we need sir?  Jethro Tull used to be my favorite band, but after surviving the past decade with no new music from the band, and an ever increasing array of remixed, remastered, redone versions of the same old crap, I've had enough.    What's next?  The Norwegian version of \\"Passion Play\\"?  I can hardly wait!
B000V86OKG|5.0|Season 1 had started off with a disturbing bang and ended with one. Season 2 cranks up the disturbingness and darkness and gives us another killer season yet. While the first one had focused mainly on the ice cream truck killer, this one focuses on his struggle with his own identity and who he is. With a grim and menacing 12 episodes, we have a darker feel to the character, a suspecting Sgt. Doakes suspicious about Dexter, Rita's ex-husband coming back to haunt her, and an all-new copycat killer, all of which his situations will have you on the edge of your seat and biting your nails. Season 2 of Dexter proves that you can carry an all new plot and still have a great show that is menacing and dark in every aspect. Overall, if you loved Season 1, be sure to pick this beauty up. As with the first season, this begins with a disturbing bang and ends with one. If you love the darkness and complexity of the first season, do buy this.

B001E95ZII|4.0|\\"The Rocker\\" is a surprisingly enjoyable movie, with engaging performances, jokes that are suited for the material, and a fairly solid premise. I was consistently interested in what was going on, and I actually cared about the characters. In a sense, it's like a sports movie, in which we root for the heroes to fight the good fight and emerge victorious. I'm hard pressed to say it was any better than it wanted to be, however. Had this story been told dramatically, it probably would have been much more powerful; the rise to fame is not without its turmoil, especially when the celebrities are teenagers. The idea of an adult drummer leading a teenage rock band from the garage to the arena is full of emotionally charged possibilities. Many of them weren't explored because \\"The Rocker\\" was made as a comedy. But that's okay. It still works.    The story begins in 1986, just as a popular heavy metal band called Vesuvias finishes a gig in Cleveland. Despite their success, the drummer, Robert \\"Fish\\" Fishman (Rainn Wilson), is unceremoniously kicked out of the band. He swears that he'll make it no matter what, but when we flash forward twenty years, it's clear that things haven't worked out as planned; Fish spends his days doing the tasks of a soul-crushing desk job. When he's fired for unruly behavior (namely attacking a coworker for playing the new Vesuvias album), he's forced to leave his apartment and move in with his disapproving sister, Lisa (Jane Lynch), her thrill-seeking husband, Stan (Jeff Garlin), and their quarrelsome children, Violet (Samantha Weinstein) and Matt (Josh Gad). Matt and his high school friends Amelia (Emma Stone) and Curtis (Teddy Geiger) have formed a rock band called A.D.D.; after weeks of trying, they will finally have their first gig at the prom.    But there's a problem: the drummer was suspended from school and grounded by his mother. With little resources available, and with only one day to go until the gig, Matt asks Fish if he would be willing to once again pick up his drumsticks. Fish accepts, and when prom night arrives, everything goes smoothly. At least, it does at first; things go wrong when Fish ruins A.D.D.'s rendition of Peter Gabriel's \\"In Your Eyes.\\" When the smoke clears, everyone decides to give Fish another chance, but only if he can get them another gig. Then comes the night all four members practice with each other via webcams--Fish, not realizing the device on his laptop is a camera and not a microphone, sits completely naked at his drum set. \\"Hello, YouTube,\\" says Violet maliciously, watches everything on her computer.    Before anyone knows it, the video known as \\"The Naked Drummer\\" is an Internet sensation. It isn't long before a scummy L.A. agent named David Marshall (Jason Sudeikis) enters with promises of fame and fortune. Thus begins A.D.D.'s Midwest tour, in which they open for other various bands. Hopefully, this will pave the way to more serious venues, maybe even their first solo gig. Of course, nothing like this can happen without some trouble along the way; Fish, hoping to loosen up the other members, encourages reckless behavior, like destroying hotel rooms and attending wild parties (by some miracle, the issue of alcohol never comes up). While all the parents recognize that Fish is a bad influence, Curtis' mother, Kim (Christina Applegate), believes that the kids should follow their hearts. She volunteers to stay with the band for the rest of the tour to keep an eye on things.    At a certain point in the film, Fish is faced with a very tough decision. I won't reveal what it is, but I will say it creates the first real rift between him and the rest of the band. The question is raised: Was Fish always meant for a life of rock and roll, or is he just a sloppy, irresponsible dreamer that refuses to grow up? One could ask the same thing about most music superstars, which is why it's almost impossible to get an answer. Some are famous because they got lucky while other have actual talent. It seems that everyone in A.D.D. is talented enough: Fish certainly knows his way around a drum set; Amelia's good with a guitar, and Matt can really work a synthesizer; Curtis is a natural songwriter, although one wonders if he'll ever get past his abandonment issues. His father left him when he was only four, and he's been brooding about it ever since.    If this movie is, in fact, giving us a message, then it's probably the most obvious one we can think of: we have to do what we love and not let anyone stand in the way. We're also told about sticking together no matter what, since a band is essentially like a family. In this case, it's a family that doesn't want to \\"grow up\\"; they want to eat, breathe, and sleep music without becoming corporate-run zombies that sit behind desks staring at computer screens. Fish suffered that fate for twenty years, making a living but not being alive. All he wanted was to have a good time, and he finds that passion once again helping his nephew's band. The movie itself shares that same passion for fun, which is a nice change from some of the raunchier immature comedies released over the past couple of months (\\"Step Brothers\\" and \\"Drillbit Taylor\\" come to mind). \\"The Rocker\\" is funny without being excessive, and it actually tells us a story we can believe in. While it wasn't made as a drama, there are moments that are a bit more thoughtful in their approach. The fact that the filmmakers knew when to let the humor simmer down tells me they took their work seriously.
B001D7TW8U|3.0|The drama was weak compared to the Henry VIII story line in HBO's the Tudors.  In this story, Henry visits the Boleyns, falls off his horse in a ride with Ann (NP), injuries nursed by recently married untitled mans wife Mary(SJ) who is then asked to come to court (gives husband job), takes Mary to his bed, she eventually becomes pregnant and Henry's eye continues to wonder (to Ann) who teases Henry with flirts yet rejects his gifts.  It glosses over the separation of England from the Roman Catholic Church as well as the religious and political turmoil, and treasonous plots other than adultry and thus becomes boring.  Ok for a 2 hour rent.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Believe it or not, I'm not a huge A7X fan. When I heard Bat Country on the Radio, I couldn't help but think \\"This is ridiculous! Who came up with the idea for this, Rosie O'Donnell?\\". However, a year later, a friend had played A7X around me and I had gotten used to it. Then I DLed a few A7X songs and thought, \\"Hot DAMN this is some good stuff!\\", and then later, I had bought City of Evil, and I LOVED it! I mean, while Iron Maiden are my favorite band, I definitely consider this to be a metal milestone. What you get is 10 fun and creative songs. Beginning the album is \\"The Beast and the Harlot\\", which is known on Guitar Hero II. A very fun and catchy song, irresistible and in-your-face. My favorite track off of this is \\"Burn it Down\\", which is very fast and wastes no time stopping to slow down. Great lyrics and M. Shadows' voice shines. The ballad Seize The Day is very slow and great, kind of reminds me of some of Iron Maiden's slow stuff. The album finishes off with M.I.A, an angsty Anti-Bush song that is very angry and in your face. Overall, if you're looking for some angry and in your face music, get this album!
0312323867|4.0|When I finished reading \\"Something Borrowed\\", I thought it was an excellent book and I couldn't put it down. And at first, I thought I'd be skeptical of Rachel who slept with her best friend's (Darcy) fiance, Dex. But I really felt for Rachel throughout the book and was surprised with myself that I wanted her to be with Dex. And when she was at the end of the book, I was excited about it! And so much went on in the book like Darcy dragging Rachel around wedding planning, Rachel and Dex and their sexual tension when the whole gang went to the Hamptons, and even the flashbacks of Rachel and Darcy of how their friendship came to be. The first book had so much going on that it kept me wanting to know more as the story unfolds.    Now I just finished reading \\"Something Blue\\", and I was even more excited to know that the story of \\"Something Borrowed\\" was continuing! First of all, I have to say that I love Emily Giffin's writing and the way she develops the characters in both books. And I liked that the plot was simple in this case because it kept you reading and the chapters just flew by. In fact I was sad that the books ended!     Second of all, I did like that Darcy's character wasn't different than from the first book. And I was expecting her character to have a turn-around at some time in the book (one thing I have to admit, a lot of things are predictable). The beginning of the book was very interesting because it shows Rachel and Dex's betrayal from Darcy's perspective. And I have to agree with many commenters here that if you hated Darcy in the first book, you'll still hate her in the second! ;) But not in a way that turns you off, because even though I liked Rachel more and not Darcy, I was very intrigued by seeing the world and turn of events through Darcy's eyes. Her inner monologue is very different from Rachel's and you find yourself not sympathizing or feeling sorry for her, even though she's a single, jilted-bride/mother-to-be.     But now for the negatives:As you read through the book, you'll notice that not a lot of things happen. The story takes place mostly in London, when Darcy flies there to live with Ethan (Rachel and Darcy's childhood friend) because she needs an escape from her job and elite socialite life in New York City. Once she feels that everyone, including her family, have \\"betrayed\\" her, she wants to start a brand new life in London. This started out OK, but to me this felt exactly like the first book, when Rachel visited Ethan in London. So it was like the same song and dance again. And even though I really liked Ethan in the first book, I didn't quite understand how he came to love Darcy for more than a friend (considering how awful of an guest she's been to him for months!). He seemed so loyal to Rachel in the first book, but then he does a complete character change and is completely loyal to Darcy. I didn't quite get that so much...     While I'm on the topic, I also didn't like the whole Marcus/Darcy situation which started this whole dilemma. I just couldn't see someone like Darcy with someone like Marcus (not that he wasn't a great character, I liked him in the first book!). But what bothered me, is why did she seem to purposely make herself pregnant with him in the first place? I think she mentioned that maybe she needed an excuse to break it off with Dex, but that's a bit of an extreme to do that!    So anyway, back to Ethan and Darcy and how it all turns out at the end, I really didn't believe it so much. Everything happened way too fast in the book, like from finding a job to dating Greggory and meeting his son, to finally discovering that she wants to be with Ethan. And meanwhile, that whole time that the book was focused on Darcy and Ethan, I was really hoping that Darcy and Rachel would confront each other and somehow patch things up. They kind of did in the end, but I felt the ending was focused too much on her and Ethan, when I thought that the whole story was supposed to be about thefriendship of Rachel and Darcy.    But overall, I did like \\"Something Blue\\" and I do recommend it for a nice, light summer read. :) I just wished that Rachel and Darcy had interacted more, just like they did in \\"Something Borrowed\\". And I missed Hillary from the first book! She was my favorite! :D
031606792X|2.0|I can not describe the disappointment I felt reading this book.  I could not put down the first three.  It was seriously like an addiction. It was all I could do to finish this one.  Did Stephanie Meyer even write this book because it was not the same voice and the characters were so different.  Edward, whose confidence was so attractive in the first books, was weak.  Rosalie, who had no relationship with Bella, was now \\"Rose,\\" and she was the closest person to Bella.  We hardly saw Alice and when we did it was basically when Bella needed fashion advice.  I guess the only character that did not change is Jacob who continued to do what he wanted, no matter how annoying and self serving, but always forgiven immediately by Bella. Jacob should have been left out of this one.  I did not need to hear anymore about him after the 3rd book.    I am very saddened that this book did not finish with the same characters I had loved, and with the same gripping story line.  This was not a page turner.  Even though these books are fantasy I could envision what Stephanie Meyer wrote about, but this one was so ridiculous I did not even want to waste my time.      Can she call this one a rough copy of the final and rewrite the final episode?
B0004Z33EQ|5.0|I just want to say, I have no mixed reviews for this movie<br />I have seen rambo 1-3 and I would have to say this one is my favorite. The first one built up to part 2. And the third one had more stealth, but this one was just perfect. It had almost over 25 explosions in one scene alone and had him hide in the bushes and get people that way (as in the first) and I think that's just awesome the way he does it. This movie had one of my favorite scenes in movie history. After he was being tortured and was forced to talk to his command station, all hell breaks loose.

B00005MP58|5.0|I love this miniseries! I hadn't read Pride and Prejudice prior to seeing the movie, but when I finally did get around to reading the book, I couldn't believe how accurate this movie was to what was in the book. In my opinion, that very rarely happens and it's great that they were able to recreate the book perfectly into a movie! In addition to the recreation, the acting, setting, costumes, and everything else I felt was just great. A&E and BBC did a great job at capturing everything perfectly. Every time I watch this movie, I hate that it has to end. I have yet to see any other versions of Pride and Prejudice, so I have no other versions to compare this one to, but I am sure that none of the others would do this version or the book justice

0543722066|5.0|This is not a literary review (We all know what Swann's Way is about), but my way of expressing relief that at last I have a readable copy of it.  Out goes my old Folio paperback with its miniscule print -- Hooray!
B00005QZ9Y|4.0|The 2001 album Ten New Songs is quite subdued and at first listen all the songs have the same slow gentle sound. But the old magic's still there on classics like In My Secret Life, Love Itself, The Land of Plenty and the elegant Alexandra Leaving.<br /><br />Cohen covers familiar themes and one even recognizes lines from earlier songs, e.g. \\"I do what I am told,\\" (That Don't Make It Junk), while the mood of The Land Of Plenty reminds me of Heart With No Companion from the [[ASIN:B0012GMW7A Various Positions]] album, a devotional with a sentiment of complete resignation and acceptance.<br /><br />By The Rivers Dark refers to Psalm 137 about remembering Zion and singing a song to the Lord by the rivers of Babylon. The most explicitly spiritual song The Land of Plenty is the highlight of the album and stirring in its melancholy and honesty: \\"For what's left of our religion/I lift my voice and pray/May the lights in the land of plenty/Shine on the truth some day\\".<br /><br />I enjoy Cohen's unusual excursions like [[ASIN:B0012GMVY4 Death of a Ladies' Man]] and the esoteric [[ASIN:B0012GMX3S Recent Songs]] as much as his classic acoustic style so I have no problem with the synth-pop production. I love Sharon Robinson's vocals as backing and where she duets with him on tracks like Boogie Street and the exquisite Alexandra Leaving.<br /><br />For more than four decades Cohen has been constructing a magnificent body of work that stands up to serious scrutiny and the passage of time. What a pleasure then, for these ten additional songs of the same sublime artistry as his first offering of the new millennium. The follow-up, 2004's [[ASIN:B0002MPTDO Dear Heather]] is even better and more varied.
B000YEUUCK|3.0|Her music is great of course.  The sets are great.  The dancers are great.  The lights and effects are great.  But, I was shocked at how stiff and unnatural she was in her own movements and in her interaction with the audience on this disc.  My wife and I actually got uncomfortable watching her.  In my humble opinion she is not a great live performer in this kind of big production setting.  Buy as many of her CD's as you can.  You cannot take that from her, she has a great voice.  Skip the high priced Blu-Ray though.  3 stars for the music and the production only.
B00168HARG|5.0|I fully expected this to be horrible (like the Bionic Woman).  To my surprise, this was a great show (unfortunately way too short. Thank you Writers Strike).  I have 3 reasons to buy this.  1. Great show  2. Blu-Ray  3. My DVR crapped out on me before I got the chance to watch he last episode. Talk about MAD.  This was a great show to fill the void when \\"24\\" was clearly going to have to wait another year or so for better writing.  $27.95 is not cheap. But you are getting over 6 hours of viewing. That's very good when you compair it to any other Blu-Rays priced at $27.95.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I don't understand all the hype and all the praise over \\"Snakes & Arrows\\"... IMO \\"Vapour Trails\\" is waaaay better... there's nothing here (on S&A) as strong as \\"One Little Victory\\" or \\"Earthshine\\" (to name just two)
0930289234|5.0|i love this graphic novel . im really glad i was able to get a paperback edition. thank you very much for the item
B0018OAPAW|5.0|Rise & Fall, Rage & Grace is a very good effort put forth by The Offspring.  It was a long wait since Splinter and the new album came not a moment too soon, especially with the current vast wasteland that is the music frontier.  In my opinion, the best songs are Nothingtown, Hammerhead, and Your're Gonna Go Far, Kid.  I replay these songs over and over when they come up on my IPOD.  Also, for a change, I think that the slower songs work well.  I like Fix You and A Lot Like Me quite a bit.  For my tastes, the only song that does not work is Stuff Is Messed Up.  With a hit ratio of 12/13, I rate this album very high!  Thanks for a great job to Dexter and the guys!!
B00168HARG|5.0|Ok, there's only 9 episodes but the story and action are very good with just a touch of humor. Sarah Connor is played by the woman who played the queen in the movie 300. Summer Glau (Terminator) is best known from her days in Firefly and Serenity. The Blu-ray quality is is also very good.
0783230079|4.0|I cry every time I watch this movie!  It is a heartwarming story where, yes, you will need to suspend disbelief and just go with it.
031606792X|1.0|I loved the first three books, but I have never experienced an author who can generate over 700 pages and say so little.  With every chapter, I kept hoping for some spark to the story, but was disappointed with the same dull conversations among the characters.  Like  many \\"series\\" books, Ms. Myers should have quit while she was ahead.
B0017MO10U|5.0|If you prefer SG-1 of old, you'll love Continuum.  I like both SG-1 movies, but this one is better than Ark of Truth.  Continuum has a great story that reminds me of the way SG-1 used to be - fighting aliens on THIS plane of existence.  There is great Sci-Fi action with an alternate time line twist!  The whole gang is in this one, including Jack O'Neil.  I found this plot to be more fluid and more interesting than Ark of Truth.
B001B71NOI|4.0|Trent Reznor continues to make listenable industrial music. After 19 years in the business, his angst is still refreshing today as it was on \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\". \\"The Slip\\" has it's merits, particularly the two most noisy tracks \\"Letting You\\" and \\"Head Down\\"--not that far from what Reznor was doing on 1992's \\"Broken\\". Then there's the the industrial rage pop of \\"1,000,000\\", \\"Discipline\\", \\"Echoplex\\" and \\"Demon Seed\\". Any one of those could be hits on modern rock or alternative music stations.<br /><br />The point where \\"The Slip\\" slips up, is on the slower tracks such as the opener \\"999,999\\" which is basically a throwaway minute and twenty five second intro to \\"1,000,000\\". \\"Lights In The Sky\\" is a direct offspring of \\"Hurt\\" from \\"The Downward Spiral\\", but it lacks the emotional grip that \\"Hurt\\" has.<br /><br />Then, for some reason, Reznor seemed to run out of ideas and gives us back to back instrumentals \\"Corona Radiata\\" and \\"The Four Of Us Are Dying\\" which total twelve minutes and ten seconds. I felt this was more indulgent and unoriginal than it was cool, trippy and relaxing.<br /><br />With all of this taken into account, I give \\"The Slip\\" four stars. Better than average, but not as good as \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\", \\"The Downward Spiral\\" or \\"With Teeth\\". The best part of buying and listening to Reznor is that he is a free agent now. Like Prince, this could be good or bad. When you're on your own, you have no one to kick you in the pants and tell you that the music your making is garbage. Time will tell whether Reznor is better without meddling record companies.
1436109817|4.0|I have a son that doesn't like to read, and he absolutely loved this book.  It's funny and entertaining.  Not only has he read the book several times, but he has listened to it on CD.  This book has actually increased my sons interest in reading and gotten him reading other books as well.  I couldn't be happier.  We're anxiously awaiting more books in this great series.
0783225857|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all times. It arrived on time and in great condition.
1416955070|5.0|I've read most of the other reviews here and must say, this is definitely a love it or hate it book. Personally, I loved it. A YA Writer myself, I'm not normally a fan of urban fantasy. There have been some rare exceptions, such as Melissa Marr's Wicked Lovely, but as a whole I'm not a heavy reader of the genre.    City of Bones has changed my mind. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem with the beginning. As far as I could tell, Clare started out with a bang and never let up - I couldn't put it down. Not a page felt slow and her prose was dead-on and interesting the entire time. Add to that wonderfully drawn characters, snappy dialog, and quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, and this book is a definite page turner.    That being said, the plot twist at the end is one which requires your ultimate trust in the author. From interviews I've read, I have faith that Ms. Clare will make it right in the end, which is the only thing that kept me from screaming after the last few chapters. It's actually brilliant - as I will definitely buy both City Of Glass and City of Ashes to see how everything turns out for Clary, Jace, and Simon. This book is a must read for both readers and writers of the YA genre...and anyone looking for a book that they won't be able to put down.
055357342X|5.0|I have to state up front that fantasy is one of my most hated literary genres, right up there with SciFi.  That being said, I do not know what possessed me to pick up this book (oh wait, yes I do, it was the incredibly overwhelming positive feedback).  Well, those readers did not lie.  If you are a fan of the \\"quest for honor\\" type story (think here Lord of the Rings), this is about to become your most favorite series ever.  Beautifully written, incredibly imaginative, I fell in love with the series within a few pages.  You'll thank yourself for giving these a go.
031606792X|5.0|First of i have to say to those who are giving the hard reviews, please give the author a break, its only a story and if anything she's not sending bad messages to young girls or boys through the series. I enjoyed reading Breaking Dawn as much as I enjoyed the first three books. Truthfully I loved the whole \\"Twilight\\" series, and as much as I wish the author didn't end it, I was still completely satisfied. You Rock Stephanie Meyer!! dont forget about the Fans that loved all of your work, were still out here. IF it wasn't for you Edward wouldn't constantly be on our minds 24/7 lol. Thank you. What an amazing fantasy story. Perfect ending!
B000MXPE7O|1.0|I couldn't find anything in this film remotely entertaining about this film.  Sure some facts are meticulous, but as far as ever caring about any of these characters-nada.  It's just slightly better than Clooney's Syriana.  At least I was able to make heads or tails what was going on in this one.  I just still didn't care.  Pass this one by if you can.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|This one of those films that distorts completly history. A US crew gets an Enigma machine and break the German World War II codes. This is false, the British with some help from the Poles broke the Enigma and the German codes. Hollywood must not produce this type of movies that have nothing to do with reality and are clearly a lie.
0345501292|5.0|Most people know that Tom Selleck was the original choice to play Indiana Jones but did you know that Tim Matheson also tested for the role?  Or did you know that Sean Young tested for the part of Marion Ravenwood?  These facts and so much more are revealed in The Complete Making of Indiana Jones from Del Rey Books.  The 300 page, over-sized trade paperback delves deep into the Indiana Jones series and explores all four films with an abundance of interesting stories and facts and hundreds of photos.<br /><br />A third of the book is devoted to Raiders of the Lost Ark for several reasons.  This chapter not only looks at the development of the first film, but the genesis of the character as well as the friendship that developed between Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.  The pair met for the first time back in 1968 on the campus of UCLA where Lucas' film THX 1138 4EB was being shown during a student film festival.  It's amazing how much the careers of these two men parallel each other.  They both had early films that were well received before they each had their first mega-hit in the mid-70s, Spielberg with Jaws, and Lucas with Star Wars.<br /><br />You almost feel like you are part of those early meetings regarding Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones (Originally called Indiana Smith!).  Lucas, Spielberg, and writer Lawrence Kasdan were meeting in early 1978 and already drafting a script and drawing storyboards.  Excerpts from these meetings and early concept art and sketches are provided to give the reader a sense of how much planning went into what was, at the time, considered to be a \\"B\\" movie.  Legendary comic book artist Jim Steranko was hired to produce several paintings to help develop the look of the film and the character.  You'll learn about scenes that never made the final cut including the experimental Nazi jet aircraft.  You also get to see rare photos of Selleck screen testing with Sean Young and Matheson screen testing with Karen Allen.  The book is like a daily diary, zealously chronicled by those who were there and lived through it all...there's details about production difficulties and delays, like all the stuntmen getting sick at once during Raiders.<br /><br />The chapter on Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (originally entitled...Temple of Death) provides a peek at the early script and shooting summary.  This was the film that caused the MPAA to create the now common PG-13 rating as they were confused over whether to rate the film PG or R due to some of the graphic imagery and child slavery.  One of the most notorious difficulties was dealing with the over 80,000 insects that the film required, whose numbers would decrease each day during shooting as they would simply disappear into cracks and cervices.<br /><br />From there it's on to exploring Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and the latest film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (which went through numerous title changes).  The last chapter is especially interesting because it shows how long a fourth Indy film was in the works but the difficulties in getting everyone onboard took many years to work out.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book, loaded with information and photos.

B00168ML1G|5.0|Now this was a great movie, they did an awesome job with it and everyone I know enjoyed watching this movie.  There was someone here who mentioned Full Screen. I just wanted to say Yo Dude spend for a better TV, Full screen cuts the original format and you are only seeing part of the film. And this Movie is one where you don't want to miss anything. The increase size is probably for the flying scenes where they need more room to show off the Suits abilities. This movie is Iron Man after all. (no disrespect intended) A great example of what I am talking about would be the difference between the full screen and wide screen versions of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The scene where Indy and his father are driving the motorcycle. You miss so much of the interaction between the two in the Full Screen Version.  But review is about Iron Man so back to the review. The acting was great and Robert Downey Jr looks just like Stark in the comics.  The suit is awesome and the special effects added nicely to the movie to help complement the scenes.  This movie is worth it.  If you liked the comics then you should like this movie.  Just sit back an enjoy. =^_^=
006082543X|5.0|There are comic writers, and good comic writers, and then there are a select few in an elite class who are simply head and shoulders above the rest.  They are like LeBron James playing basketball with guys from a YMCA league.  One of these is Neil Gaiman, whose beautiful prose never ceases to amaze.  Gaiman's 2003 best-selling novel has been adapted into graphic format by artist P. Craig Russell.  Harper Collins describes this as a novel for young readers but that sells the book short.  This modern fantasy is perfect for all ages...a kind of modern day Alice in Wonderland although much darker in tone.<br /><br />Coraline (Not Caroline!) has moved into a big house in the country with her parents.  The house is shared by elderly, retired actresses Miss Forcible and Miss Spink, who live in the lower flat, and Mr. Bobo, who claims he trains mice, who lives in the upper flat.  Coraline is a typical young girl, curious and easily bored.  While waiting out a rainy day, she decides to explore the big house and finds a door with a brick wall behind it.  He mother explains the house was separated off when it was turned into apartments.  But Coraline cannot help but be inquisitive about the mysterious door, especially after it is open when she knows she saw her mother lock it.<br /><br />One day, with her parents away, Coraline opens the door to find the brick wall gone and another apartment on the other side; an apartment almost like her own and yet subtly different.  She steps through to find herself in an alternate world.  Here, her parents are attentive to her every need and are not busy with work all the time.  But her new mother is not quite like her real mom.  Her fingers are longer and bonier, and she has coat buttons where her eyes should be.  She wants Coraline to stay with her forever!  Coraline retreats back to her apartment only to find her parents missing.  Now, she'll have to go back to the other mom and use all of her wits and resources to find her real parents and escape back to her world.<br /><br />Coraline is a work of dark, and sometimes disturbing beauty.  The last third of the book features very intense imagery as Coraline gambles in a game of wits with her otherworldly mother.  As Coraline makes progress in their wager, we see the new mom's loving, cheerful guise begin to fade as a darker side manifests itself.  Besides her new parents there are twisted versions of the elderly women and Mr. Bobo to contend with although Caroline will find aid from an unexpected source as she uncovers the secrets in the other apartment.<br /><br />Gaiman crafts a story where a little girl has to find her own identity but also speaks to the idea of family values.  We have to sometimes step back from our jobs and everyday stresses to realize what it important to all of us unless we too get caught up in our own dark realities.  There is perhaps no better artist suited to tell this story than P. Craig Russell.  His fluid, graceful style brings Gaiman's characters to life, often in terrifying fashion.  Even with buttons for eyes, Russell captures the malevolence of the new mom.<br /><br />Harper Collins has been putting out some fantastic graphic novels in the past couple of years and Coraline is the best one yet!ck to her world.

B0017APPSO|5.0|The effort to produce a fantastic disc about a serious subject was impressive and appreciated.
0739367676|5.0|I loved the whole series.  The first book was the best but not all books are going to be light and airy.  They have to have conflict.  I have literally read the entire series in less than a week because I could hardly put the books down.  They were wonderful, perfectly written and had to have all the conflict.  I loved it.  I cant wait to read what else she has.  People need to stop complaining about certain issues and just enjoy a romantic story and move on.  It wasnt for life application, just a really good read.
B00008BXJG|5.0|\\"Highway To Hell\\" would be the album that put AC/DC on the map in the U.S., but would also be the last for lead singer Bon Scott who would die of alcohol poisoning shortly after the album's release.  Scott always harnessed a playful nod and a wink sense of humor in his lyrics and vocals that would raise the level of the material up a few notches.   You never got the feeling that he was taking himself too seriously.  Musically in many ways AC/DC sticks to their patented formula, but on this album everything works very nicely.  The title track became the band's first legit hit in the U.S. and remains one of the most famous classic rock guitar riffs to this day.  For straight ahead rock n roll with a slight bluesy touch in spots it does not get much better than this.  For me \\"Highway To Hell\\" may be the all time best AC/DC studio album and remains a hard rock classic from the end of the 70's.

Deepak Chopra, the author of this book, is an Indian medical doctor and writer. He has written extensively on spirituality and diverse topics in mind-body medicine. Chopra says that he has been influenced by the teachings of Vedanta and the Bhagavad Gita, as well as by Jiddu Krishnamurti, and by the field of quantum physics (although in this particular book there are no references to quantum physics). You can skim through this book regularly to check on how are you succeeding in the following areas:  - non-attribution;   - refraining from judgments;  - cease to defend your point-of-view or your \\"self-esteem\\"  - doing things with the least possible efforts,   All the things above mentioned, as well as the other mentioned in this book, lead to wealthy and healthy life.    I also recommend another book by Deepak Chopra: \\"Creating Affluence\\", in addition to this book.
0374530718|5.0|This was a good book to read and the story line showed an interesting and unraveling plot twisting its way through major contents of philosophical knowledge. It is a pleasant read and one that is relaxing and kind to the mind. It is worth buying if you want to know philosophy in a simple and historical way and it will give you some basic understanding on how philosophy evolved. The author has written it in his unique perspective and it has many creative moments making it very special and memorable.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|I can't say I'm a huge fan of REM but I recently picked up this CD and would rate it as very good.  Like their old stuff.     Starts off strong with this rocking \\"Living Well Is the Best Revenge\\".  Continues strong with \\"Man-sized Wreath\\" and \\"Supernatural Superserious\\".  Slows down into a melancholy track - (I've become a) \\"Hollow Man\\".     Next track, \\"Houston\\", is solid:     \\"Houston is filled with promise   Laredo is a beautiful place   and Galveston sings like that song that I loved   Its meaning has not been erased\\"     I really liked this CD.  A good effort by a great band.  Good to hear that they have produced a solid CD.     The songs average about three minutes in length and the entire CD is short at approx only 35 minutes.     I don't there is a bad track on this CD.     Recommended if you are at all a fan of their past work.
B001DXS4E2|4.0|I agree with the reviewer that this is a film that will be great in color...My only concern with universal studios,is that when they say \\"digitaly remastered\\", as in their two disc edition, and other films, such as \\"double indemnity\\" \\"dracula\\" \\"frankenstien\\" It only seems that they improve contrasts somewhat...such as a higher bite rate...but don't do much with restoration...and as you know for those that have the two disc version of holiday inn, its better, but still has issues of grain, contrast and some soft spots...and these become important when you want to colorize a movie...an example would be \\"SHE\\" 1935...this was colorized by legend studios, when contrasts are strong it looks real good..when not theres a tri-color postcard effect ala 1920's...my point is, when Warner brothers or Paramount redoes a film, like \\"Its a wonderful life\\" they improved on an already great transfer..and the color process worked beautifully...so..I hope universal tries to improve the transfer before the colorization, otherwise,your just paying extra money to have the film in color with the previous transfer,
B000X5SPBI|2.0|I remember watching the first season religiously.  I went to any length necessary to see episodes that I missed.  The show was great!  Then came the second season where Dean was an emotional wreck and Sam turned into a wimp.  Okay, fine, it's the second season - it will get better.  Third season comes and it's pretty good...right up until the writer's strike and all of a sudden I don't get the other 8 episodes promised, leaving plot holes and an overall disappointing season.  Then, they want to charge the full price of a regular season for 2/3 of a season provided.  I don't pay full price for 2/3 of a haircut.  I don't pay full price to see 2/3 of a movie.  I don't pay full price for 2/3 of a pizza.  I won't pay full price for 2/3 of a crappy season, even if it is my favorite show (it's a sliding scale).
0446401307|4.0|Michael Connelly fans know Harry Bosch. He's the kind of scrupulously honest, clever, always-ready-to-break-the-rules-to-solve-the-case kind of detective you would want on the trail, assuming you're a good guy. Having read several Bosch novels, I was able to fill in the blanks a lot here, for the characters, several of whom appear in earlier works, are not well developed.    The plot centers on a Connelly staple: the tension between the feds (Foolish Bureau of Investigation?) and the locals. There's also the classic bit about the  grizzled veteran breaking in the new partner.     The big mystery is the cold-blooded murder of a man who is carrying a large amount of radioactive cesium. It seems the cesium was stolen by terrorists.     The first fifteen chapters read like something Connelly could have written in his sleep. But, fortunately, it heats up, and the last eight chapters build to an exciting climax.    One thing I've found from Connelly's books: pay attention, particularly when Bosch is sniffing around. Connelly doesn't clutter his work with meaningless leads.    I haven't rated any of the other Connelly books that I have read, but I believe they were all solid fives. However, this book needs more depth, more detail. So, holding this work up against the high standards of other Connelly novels, I have to give it a four.
0316286850|5.0|If you've bought a beauty DIY book in the past decade you know that HALF the content invariably comprises the writer's flagrant self-promotion, while the other half, advertising for commercial products...often from the writer's own [or their friends'] brand lines. No so with 'MAKING FACES!' Almost every page offers realistic, achievable enhancements for real life women, using generic products.<br /><br />Contrary to one silly review, you cannot \\"flip through this book at Barnes & Noble\\" because the SEEMINGLY trite techniques need to actually be performed by the ordinary woman to see the stunning but realistic transformations for herself. The kind that make you wonder just how ugly all those much-admired famous faces are without talent like Kevyn's propping them up. Additionally, the lone reviewer complaining of `lack of realism' joins the reviewer complaining of no step-by-step instructions, in making me question THEIR sense of reality. C'mon Girls! The same way we all translate & personalize Haute Couture into everyday skins; Aucoin's most dramatic techniques can also be simplified into everyday looks.<br /><br />Most wonderful: Aucoin's [glossy photo] [step-by-step] transformations of unknown women into better, everyday versions of themselves; along with the startlingly, ATYPICAL dramatizations of many famous faces. All proving that TECHNIQUE can truly transform and hypnotize! MUST SEE: the glossy close-ups of Drew Barrymore as the 'Sophisticate,' Andy Macdowell into the Oriental 'Temptress' and Demi Moore as the 1920's 'Vamp,' among many other scintillating looks.<br /><br />As for Kevyn Aucoin...genius! A generous, sensible, humanitarian genius at that! Read the mini-biographies of the people made-over; and Kevyn's common-sense advice [against kids wearing make-up; and pageants etc, etc] and you will appreciate the man as well as the artiste all the more.<br /><br />Ironically, Aucoin's generosity in sharing this hard-earned experience, which other industry professionals keep so closely guarded(?), inspired such respect and trust in me...I actually went looking for his products. Now I'm a double Aucoin fan!<br /><br />BUY THIS BOOK! Then ACTUALLY try, try, TRY the step-by-step techniques before reviewing the book...and by the end of your experimentation, you'd be wishing that he were straight and available! But...that's another book!
B0017VG69U|5.0|The fabulous remastered Second Season is here! Much of the special effects--not all--have been mastered to what they should be. Some notable examples include:    --Amok Time: the combat arena is now on top of a CGI butte, overlooking a Vulcan city in the distance.   --Who Mourns for Adonais?: when Adonais grows two stories high, there is no thick black line around him, like the 1960's effect shows.   --The Changling: an explosion of \\"Nomad\\" resembles a space nuke explosion, back before the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963.   --The Doomsday Machine: THE BEST REMASTERED EPISODE! Terrific shots of the Enterprise are shown dodging asteroids, with some exploding around a thrashed Constellation. Best of all, the Doomsday Machine no longer looks like elementary school, crepe-paper art.  --Catspaw: haunted castle is CGI, and the two aliens at the end no longer have black strings holding them up.  --Metamorphosis: better shuttle effects, but the image of the \\"Companion\\" STILL looks like COLORED PLASTIC WRAP.   --Journey to Babel: Great shot of the shuttle entering the Enterprise's hanger, with planet Vulcan in the background. The Orion spaceship is CGI, but they should have put CGI eyeballs in the Telerite's hollow mask!  --Friday's Child: the Klingon ship is no longer a flourescent green smudge  --The Ultimate Computer: Great starship dogfights!  --The Deadly Years: TEN Romulan warbirds surround the Enterprise and take shots at it. WOW! A nice ending to a slower episode.  --The Trouble with Tribbles: a pre-Season 3 Klingon ship. This one is orbiting spacestation K-7, but the latter still looks like a model.  --Gamesters of Triskelion: the Enterprise orbits a Saturn-like planet.  --The Immunity Episode: The galactic amoeba is STUNNING! The Enterprise actually accelerates backwards through protoplasm, with some of the goo splattering on the ship's swan-neck.    Of course, let us honor the memories of the thin red line of extra crewmen, by recalling how they heroically died inthe line of Federation duty:    --The Changling: 4 Red Shirts incinerated by half-breed probe \\"Nomad,\\" and possibly two engineering crewmembers.  --The Apple: 1 Red Shirt dead after a planet's poisonous flowers shoot darts into his chest. 1 Red Shirt incinerated by bolt of lightening. 1 Red Shirt blown up by land-mine rock. 1 Red Shirt clubbed to death by a Child of Vahl.  --Catspaw: 1 crewman dead (as dead as Chekov's girl whig) after beaming back from a haunted planet.  --Friday's Child: 1 Red Shirt stabbed in chest by a Capellan's boomerang.  --The Deadly Years: 1 science lieutenant chick dies from accelerated old age.  --Obsession: 5 Red Shirts dead after getting their red corpuscles sucked out by a honey-smelling smog  --Wolf in the Food: 1 crew woman stabbed to death by Jack the Ripper via Scotty.  --By Any Other Name: 1 Red Shirt chick turned into one of Gene Roddenberry's Tijuana octogon souvineers...then crushed.  --The Omega Glory: 1 Red Shirt killed by the captain of the Exeter, who turns traitor in a commie village (Mao would be proud).  --The Ultimate Computer: 1 Red Shirt gets desintigrated by the M5  --Mirror Mirror: 5 Red Shirts are killed in the \\"mirror universe\\" as part of the evil crew. Should we honor them, too? Probably not. I'll just let the evil 'Chuck Ruck' in his mirror universe do it.    May these TWENTY extra crewmen IN OUR UNIVERSE rest in peace!

B0017R5UAA|5.0|I had a bootleg of this album a month before the official release.  (Not to worry, I bought the cd here as soon as it came out)  It took this long to write a review because it's not an easy album to fully comprehend in the short term.  After the nearly perfect and perhaps more accessible debut ep Sun Giant, this full-length cd was far more difficult to warm up to.  But just as in life, where nothing worth doing is ever easy, the brilliance of this album becomes more and more obvious over time.    Comparisons to other bands might seem easy, but ultimately are only useful as a guidepost to a type of sound that might interest you as a listener.  So sure, if you like any of the 70's (or 00's) bands with a folk/rock/freak sound you may be open to the Foxes.  If Led Zep was your main 70's band, you may want to look elsewhere.  The Beach Boys may be one band that could be argued to be a significant influence.  (As songwriter and front man Robin Pecknold would probably acknowledge.)   Yet they sound NOTHING at all like them.  Nothing.  But the song structures, the harmonies, the lack of glorious guitar solos (which some wrongly refer to as \\"chops\\") might owe more to the Beach Boys than CSN&Y, (who many seem to forget were a super group that could rock out with the best of them when they wanted to).    The most striking thing about the Fleet Foxes, what separates them from most other bands out there today, is not what you have heard.  It's not the harmonies.  It's not the reverb or the beards or Seattle or the massive buzz surrounding them.  It's the most basic of all things when it comes to music.  The songwriting.    Pecknold, at 21 or 22, has already composed a collection of classics.  At least six or seven of the eleven songs on this album are standards to their fans and will be screamed for and sung along with twenty years from now if we are all lucky enough to be around by then.  I kid you not...  The other songs are nearly as good, making it the most listenable albumto come along not just this year, but probably in many, many years.    If you feel like it, you can read my little battle with Hercules_doh in the comments section of his review.  Though I feel even more strongly now about the band and the album than at that time, Meadowlarks still stands out as perhaps the only miss between the first two albums.  And it's a very near miss at that.  It's actually quite beautiful, but the lyrics at one point become a little too affected to be taken seriously.  A minor quibble to be sure.      The best thing for fans of indie music is that this band will never be for everyone.  As hot as they are right now, there are already haters out there and ears that are just not open to this kind of sound.  As beautiful as the songs are, as sweet as the harmonies are and as absent the screeching guitar solos are: do not be fooled.  This is serious music that is just different enough to keep it interesting for a lot of fans but will scare away the massive audiences that would probably end up ruining it.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|We love this film so much we just borrowed it from the library again.  My wife's father was visiting, so we played it for him.<br /><br />Hayao Miyazaki is well regarded as one of the best creators of animated film.  He is easily my favorite.  Of his films, this is my wife's favorite and in my top 5.<br /><br />There is some mild violence.  A couple of characters beat each other up pretty significantly.  It's fisticuffs, with lots of visible bruising.  No blood.  Teeth are lost, though.<br /><br />Miyazaki revisits several themes in all of his films.  One of the highlights of his films for me is the strong female characters he creates.  This tendency is age-independent.  From young girls to elderly women, and every age in between, there is strength of mind, spirit, will, and character.<br /><br />The characters and environments are crafted with lush care.  The details are gorgeous, landscapes rich, and each and every person and animal is deep, and easy to connect with.<br /><br />Broad concepts are positive and easy to grasp, but more subtle details keep more mature viewers engaged in the story as well.  Replay value is high.<br /><br />Disney secured the contract to bring Miyazaki's films to the US, and have done a splendid job with the dubbing of this one, as they have with all the rest.  Great care is taken to ensure the characters mouths synch with the dialog.  The silly distractions of poorly dubbed films are completely absent.<br /><br />It's just brilliant.
B00005JMK0|5.0|This is one of my top ten movies of all time. I die laughing every time I watch it. Here is my vote for it on DVD PLEASE! I have the VHS, and the soundtrack, now I want it on DVD. Blu-Ray would be even better!
B000002UR7|4.0|While I know most people buy this album for the track \\"Creep\\" there are other good tracks as well. It took me a while to like these tracks (like at least 4 or 5 listens) after that it stuck with me. There are some very catchy pop tunes on here. \\"Stop Whispering,\\" \\"You,\\" \\"How Do You?,\\" and \\"Vegetable\\" are some of the most memorable tracks. It is worth buying this especially if you are a fan of 90s pop/rock.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I thank the Lord for this awesome DVD of Amazing Grace.  I hope that everyone of any faith or no faith will see this blessed movie..thank you
B000002TQV|5.0|This album is the best Radiohead album I have heard. I definitely recommend it to those who are just getting into Radiohead. This is actually the first Radiohead album that I heard when my uncle played it on his CD player. At first I thought it was an ok CD but then it grew on me and I loved it. I bought it at Sam Goodie used and it was worth every penny. My most treasured album to this day. :) PLEASE BUY THIS USED or GET IT FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE ON AMAZON, IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE HERE. EMI IS CHARGING REDICULOUS PRICES FOR RADIOHEAD CDs. GREEDY CORPORATE BASTARDS.
0681947411|5.0|Theres a reason someone decided this was good enough to be a movie. Frank McCourt has an amazing voice on paper. Highly recommended for the \\"ponderers\\" of our generation. Please read his others-Well worth it!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|To all those that don't like this new album, they can suck it up and deal with it. I personally love this album. They decided to do something that, in some ways, was very different. I applaude them for that. I love all the tracks on here and I even bought a copy for my uncle so he could listen to Radiohead. As far as if that was the best album for him to start listening to Radiohead I don't know.[[ASIN:0739051075 Radiohead- In Rainbows (Guitar Tablature)]]
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I think this is donna's best release since the Bad Girls album. Each song has its own style and meaning. Her voice is timeless and that in its self is a gift. Radio has pretty much ignored her singles stamp your your feet & Sand on my feet both should have been hits on a few formats, but its no big deal radio pretty much is aiming at teeny boppers. Donna should be very proud of this release as i know most of her fans are. There should be a few grammy nods from this work of one of greatest voices ever.Looking forward to more great music from the Emperess!!  Thanks Donna we love you!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I loved this CD so much I bought it for my cousin for his birthday so he could listen to this great album. All the songs are great, even the song \\"the Tourist,\\" which of all of them is my least favorite (But I still like it.) This is my second favorite Radiohead album, with \\"the Bends\\" being my first favorite. If you like this one check out the b sides from it on the CD \\"Airbag How Am I Driving?\\" Radiohead finally got the Grammy they deserved for their fine work.[[ASIN:B000006352 Airbag/How Am I Driving?

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I've showed the first episode of this series to a lot of people.  Their opinions fall into two distinct categories.    Either they are fascinated and want to see more, or they are too disturbed to watch more.  There are those who decline to watch further just on the principle that they object to the premise.  Some say that they just can't find anything in Dexter to relate to.  But nobody has ever suggested that the episodes aren't brilliant.    If someone had tried to explain the premise to me I wouldn't have been interested.  Serial killers, bleh.  But Dexter is different.  It paints a picture of a man who was dealt a terrible hand early on in life, but who struggles to do the right thing, without the tools to determine what the \\"right thing\\" is other than what was imparted to him by his foster father (now deceased), who is a fascinating character in his own right.    Dexter has no social conscience and no emotional clues to guide him through the events of his existance, nothing but a firm faith in the principles of the man who raised him.  When the very foundations of his faith in Harry are shaken, the choice that he is forced to make create one of the most hauntingly memorable scenes that I have ever seen in a TV series.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I set my widescreen Monitor next to my standard TV screen.  I synched up the NEW Widescreen DVD right along side the old Fullscreen DVD.  I was shocked at how much more scenery & picture there is in this new version. THIS IS TRUE WIDESCREEN.  NOTHING HAS BEEN CROPPED !!!!   Don't believe me???  TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!!!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Even though I haven't been a beatlemaniac in the 60's and 70's, through the years, I have learned to appreciate THE BEATLES work as the greatest composers of rock-pop music from the last century.<br />LOVE is a wonderful compilation edited for a show, with a choice of such beautiful BEATLES masterpieces (how could the songs not be beautiful as all they work is wonderful?). By all means, the  choice of the songs and the edition of them, with almost no interruption between one song and the following, makes of LOVE, a smooth delightful trip through love-music as wonderful as you could desire in a dream, as chosen by yourself.<br />You won't regret having this album in your collection, it couldn't bore you ever. I don't feel, as many times as I listen to it, as I'm listening to the score of a show, and there is no distortion of the original songs or their original arrangements, just violins in WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS, but, it doesn't change the beauty of George Harrison's  original interpretation.<br />The beginning of the album with the gorgeous BECAUSE, a capella, is wonderful, is a great song, not sung as often as some BEATLES songs by other vocalists; it makes of LOVE a grateful original and pleasant beginning.<br />Listen to LOVE over and over, alone or in a reunion, and you will have a SCORE for the moment you're living. LOVE is a WONDERFUL ALBUM, thanks to THE BEATLES and to GEORGE MARTIN for it.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|Don't be misled.  This is not just a teen drama.  The incredible writers manage to parallel the stories of the adults in the show with their younger counter parts so seamless that you don't realize it, until the end when you look at your teenager and say \\"hey!\\"  This is a series that all parents should watch with their teenage kids.  It definately gives the parents and their teens serious discussion material!
0446677450|1.0|Ok, let's skip the fact that by Kiyosaki's own admission, both dads were to a great extent fabricated.     Let's skip the fact that many of the experiences in this book were either embellished or outright fabricated.     Let's skip the fact that much of what he speaks of is in generalities without specific details.     What remains are pleasant-sounding platitudes, lacking in the real-life specifics that most people need. To say that \\"The poor work for their money, while the rich have their moeny work for them\\" sounds nice, but is of very little help to someone lacking a compass.     About the only thing that I agree with Kiyosaki on is the fact that our schools (at all levels) lack any kind of personal finance educational curriculum. This is an absolute travesty, but understandable when you consider that our nation is running record budget deficits. When debt is a way of life, people tend to accept it as a given in their own situation.     I've known several people who are devotees of this book series. None (as in zero) have made a discernable difference in their lives. Most are also devotees of MLMs such as Amway, Quixtar and MonaVie...the common thread here being the desire to succeed (which is admirable), but the unwillingness to get the degree, the job and put in the time. Another Kiyosaki theme of \\"Become a real estate investor!\\" sounds great on paper, but without the education and training can potentially be a disaster. No one book (or series like this) can prepare someone for an entire career.     If you want to learn how to handle money, try Suze Orman, Dave Ramsey or Lou Rukeyser. The fact that this series is a bestseller, does NOT necessarily mean the series has merit. It simply means that there is a market for baseless hope and optimism. I am sure Kiyosaki is laughing all the way to the bank.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|A must have for action movie lovers for their collections.  All four are watchable over and over again.  Danny Glover, Mel Gibson, Rene Russo and Joe Peshi have an incredible chemistry that can't be duplicated.  The addition of Chris Rock in the 4th Lethal was inspired.  Would love to see them continue, with Chris Rock as the lead and continue with the cast in place.

031606792X|2.0|Breaking Dawn is probably one of the most boring and predictable books I've ever read.    The whole time I felt as though I was reading some kind of fan fiction. The only plot twist I didn't expect was Jacob imprinting on Nessie, and in a way that really ruined it for me.    The major problem with this book is everyone gets a happy ending. I'm aware it's fantasy, but this is sickening. The whole birth of Nessie even violated the rule that Meyer created in the first book. This is equally sickening.    The whole teenage pregnancy and marriage is a bad message, but it didn't really bother me. Her parents reactions were unrealistic, but the rest of the town acted as anyone would. I'm not going to say it doesn't send a bad message to young girls in love, but that isn't an excuse for crap that goes on these days.    Just read the Wikipedia article for this one guys. The 754 pages aren't worth it.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|Those who have watched this film will undoubtedly be familiar with the old Japanese Cartoon that it's based upon. Most viewers will also most likely be familiar with the Wachowski Brothers biggest work, the Matrix Trilogy. They have delivered again with this fast paced, colourful and beautifully designed anime adaptation. I say beautiful but I can't really describe it any other way except to call the whole thing magnificent. The Wachowski's are real visionaries when it comes to movie making. With Speed Racer they took their artistic genius and put a whole new spin on it. The races are fast paced and truly artistic when displaying the race backgrounds, colours and general sequences involving crashes are unashamedly cartoon-like. Even the fight scenes are insanely ridiculous but unbelievably fun.<br /><br />The story starts with a kid who has natural racing instincts and idolises his brother, Rex Racer who at the time is one of the greatest auto mobile racers of the time. His brother Rex is unfortunately killed in a race after signing with another racing team and leaving the family team. Speed grows up to become one of the best racers in the world racing for his team Racer Motors. One day he's offered an extremely generous offer from the slimy, yet extremely rich Mr. Royalton, owner of the conglomerate Royalton Industries. Speed has always been taught by his family never to trust these big corporations as they are responsible for the death of his brother. He turns down Mr. Royalton's offer. Bitter about the rejection Royalton starts to reveal how he's deluded about racing and how companies have been fixing races for years in exchange for profit. He threatens to destroy the Racer family and Speeds future of racing. After making good on his initial threats, Speed bands together with his girlfriend Trixie, his one time rival Racer X and Taejo Togokhan and enters into the Casa Cristo 5000. A deadly cross country rally in an effort to expose Royalton and his companies corruption.<br /><br />You will have to watch the film to find out what happens next, just trust me when I say you're not going to be disappointed. This movie is just shockingly great, it's not only good on the CGI side of things, but it's also supported by an excellent story and cast. I love Emile Hirsch's work and he doesn't disappoint in this cult favourite role. The real gem of this film has to be Roger Allam. His role as the sleazy and manipulative Royalton really comes off well and he's a character that you really come to dispise. He's not a massively known actor, but when in a role of this kind and pulling it off so well, you have to wonder why he isn't bigger than he is.<br /><br />A wonderful movie that is enjoyable for the whole family. I can imagine the beauty would be multiplied by 100 in HD so I can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray myself.You will have to watch the film to find out what happens next, just trust me when I say you're not going to be disappointed.

B0006L5RT2|5.0|Simply said, do yourself a favor and discover James Blunt, as an artist like this does not come along everyday.  You won't be disappointed and in fact may find yourself addicted to his heartfelt yet intellectual lyrics and that voice which is full of naked emotion just like the songs themselves.    I saw Blunt at Radio City for the Bedlum Tour. If you ever get a chance to see him live do it! You will be happily surprised.  James Blunt is a very special artist in time of vacuous releases when it looks like the end of quality music. Thank God for James. He has given us all hope again.   Like many fans I also can not wait for the 3rd album.

0375842209|4.0|The Book Thief, which is probably in the local library's \\"Young Adult\\" section, is set in Nazi Germany during WWII. Thus, it's pretty brutal at times, but it's not without redemption. Zusak uses a novel narrative approach - the story is told from Death's point of view. His sentences are spare, even choppy at times, which lends the work a clipped, regimented feel - not at all inappropriate for a wartime novel. \\"Young Adult,\\" yes, but not bedtime reading.  Zusak has created a powerful work, but it's somewhat disjointed at times.  Good - yes.  Excellent - no.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I had the fortune of seeing THE FALL in Salt Lake City (the one place it was playing in the state of Utah). All of us who went to the film agreed that it was a fantastic movie. The story has some parallels to THE PRINCESS BRIDE, but visually, it is more akin to PAN'S LABYRINTH, and the subject matter is more dramatic and stark (although, surprisingly, the film is quite humorous at points). Lee Pace and Catinca Untaru are incredible in the film. The key story takes place at a California mission in the 30s where a stunt man (Pace) has been taken after suffering a paralyzing injury. There, he meets Untaru's character, who is a young female immigrant that has broken her arm working in the orange fields. Pace begins telling her a made-up story in an effort to get her to steal Morphine (Pace's character is so unhappy, he wants to end his life). The fantasy part of the film is fantastic and the interweaving of the two stories is very affecting and touching. I am really shocked that this film did not receive more attention and acclaim. It was definitely my favorite film of the last year or so. Highly recommended.
0316789798|5.0|Recently I bought Ed Emberley's Drawing Book of Animals for my five year old daughter who loves art, but wanted more formal training.  This book is *perfect*!  Everything about it is tailored for children who can draw some shapes and it progresses from simple animals to the lovely, elaborate dragon at the end.  My daughter is learning how to draw better shapes (and animals) without getting frustrated.  The step-by-step simple instructions capture a child's attention and makes them more focused on the process than the end result.  Overall, a really wonderful book!
B0012E2HRC|4.0|This is a film that I first dismissed as corny, but as time has passed I can now appreciate the struggles of the protagonists in middle-age angst, tempted by the overwhelming feelings that love can bring.  The book was horrific tripe, but the film is done well, thanks to C Eastwood who is masterful as a director and actor, not to mention to the incredible Ms. Streep (as always!)

B001AIRUP4|5.0|Wow, wow, and wow...the Blu-ray version of this film blows all the others away. I have recently converted to Blu-ray, so I am still basking in the glow of the clarity of this new format, so bear with me! Inspired by the classic Rankin-Bass stop-motion animation Christmas classics & \\"The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,\\" Tim Burton's film tells the tale of Jack Skellington, a kind mis-guided soul who falls in love with Christmas, and attempts to put his own Halloween spin on it, wreaking havoc when the two holidays collide. The characters are memorable: Sally (a Bride-of-Frankenstein-type rag doll who attempts to escape her maker, the twisted Dr. Finklestein), Jack's ghostly pet dog, Zero, the evil Oogie Boogie (a green sack-like boogie-man addicted to gambling), the Mayor of Halloween Town (who actually has two faces that spin around according to his mood and what he wants to show the town!), and Lock, Shock, & Barrel (mischievous trick-or-treaters who kidnap Santa!). The emotion that is able to be achieved by Burton's crew through the puppets is nothing short of astounding, and Burton's Germanic-stylized sets are a visual feast.<br /><br />Bonus features include:<br /><br />New! \\"What's This? Jack's Haunted Mansion Holiday Tour.\\" This featurette takes you through Disneyland's Haunted Mansion from start to finish with the Nightmare Before Christmas Holiday Overlay. Options of watching the featurette with or without trivia popups (which are very fun and interesting).<br /><br />New!

B000TNF7NS|4.0|While the bands third (new offical first) album with the German guitar God Michael Schenker had formed the foundation of their new influential hard rock/heavy metal sound, the memory of their first two pre-Schenker era space rock efforts were still agust. Phil Moog, Schenker, Pete Way, and Andy Parker again entered the studio with producer Leo Lyons to do the follow up and second album. While 1974's Phenomenon only hinted at the hard rock genius, the group sometimes seemed afraid or maybe not sure how to translate their vision but on this album they do just that and bludgeon the listener in the process. The rip roaring opener Let It Roll serves as a sequel to Budgie's epic Breadfan with the double bass drum speed that would go in to influence countless 80's thrash metal bands. Next on the roster is the fun and melodic sing along Shoot Shoot, another key moment. Love Lost Love while not as oft-mentioned is not by any stretch a bad song and is much a companion to Shoot Shoot with its catchy themes. The album takes a small dip in momentum with High Flyer , the bands last ounce of desire to create hazy psychedelic rock. Out In The Street returns things to form somewhat albeit with a more mellow approach. The next step to the bands evolution would come here with keyboards. They dont overtake the band by any means. Played in the studio by Ten Years After key man Chick Churchill, and later by new member Danny Peyronel.The albums masterpeices lay in the nasty Mother Mary and This Kids, some of UFO's best work. The hidden gem here being Dance Your Life Away, a rarely mentioned rocker packed with grooves. Although current metal bands do away with such influences I believe it was this era of metal and along with some of the 80's legends like AC/DC, Motorhead, Maiden, Priest that although were bound in guitar heavy composition do pay respect to UFO and other less forunate 70's masters of heavy riffs. The 2008 remastered edition packs unbeatable sound and lavishing packaging. Though only one of it's bonus tracks is worthy that being the unreleased song A Million Miles. The others are live tracks of the albums highlights that would be much outdone by the live album mammoth of Strangers In The Night, and even that point aside the arrangements between the two are without change. This doesnt subtract anything from this great new package from a band that is long overdue such a treatment. A \\"proto metal\\" classic.
B0018O4YSQ|1.0|Important information especially for customers outside the USA. This movie is not region free, but instead region A (America). You cannot play this disc in any European country !!! I have to return my disc, because I cannot play it.  Since blue ray is the winner in the HD format, more and more blue ray discs are no longer region free.  One star for the wrong information by Amazon, not for the film. The film deserves a five star rating.
031606792X|5.0|I'm surprised to see some of the scathing reviews of Breaking Dawn. Though the first book is still my favorite, I thought this one was excellent. The characters gained depth, and the plot moved along at a good pace. I was glad to see the happy ending; sometimes we need that fairy tale finish!
B0010X745K|2.0|I thought this sounded like a good movie so I went and rented it. It was good up until the ending scene. It made me sad and pissed off all at the same time. I can't believe they would have an ending like this one. And as for the God preaching lady she made some of the movie just annoying. No offense to any church goers out there. If you plan to watch this movie please rent it before you spend the 20-30 bucks buying it.
B0013L2EDQ|5.0|James Rollins returns to his highly successful Sigma series here with a 4th and even better book than Map of Bones.     Having become one of the top-notch thriller/Adventure writers out there today, James Rollins continues to breathe new life into this genre with crazy twists and turns of ancient science and dark designs on the world.     Done with polished panache, and surging forward with a frenetic pace with solid action/adventure stuff that Hollywood is truly missing into making into cinematic masterpiece, Rollins's 4th Sigma Force novel really is a unique and ultra-exciting installment that has once again proven that Rollins has a hard grip on this thriller genre that is second-to-none.    We were the first reviewers to review his first novel - Subterranean - and knew right then and there that this guy was going to rise to the top with his fast-paced and thrilling writing acumen.    If you are one of the few that hasn't already discovered this tremendous writer - then do yourself a favor and purchase a James Rollins book, and get ready to leave your woes behind for many an hour.
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|This girl's voice is unbelievable - so wise and soulful at such a young age and it's not enhanced or covered up with any electronic effects like so many young artists.  The music speaks to the human condition so no matter what your age you can relate.  If you're into blues, soul, or even light jazz, you will dig this.
B00006CXGM|4.0|Obviously influenced by 'Pulp Fiction' but this is a brilliant and original film in its own right. Featuring a terrific cast of many known and not so known actors all creating a character that you will remember and be able to quote by the time the movie ends. That makes repeated viewings all the more fun. Also featuring a clever screenplay and a stylish and very creative direction from Guy Ritchie. Far, far surpassing his feature debut - 'Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels' - in almost every way imaginable. Here the deliciously absurd tone and painfully funny dark humor is spread throughout the entire film, which is where 'Lock, Stock' was thrown off balance. It tried to combine humorous elements with scenes that were just plain old grim. A superb array of interlinked characters who help the movie flow seamlessly. This is also Brad Pitt's finest hour in my opinion, despite being unintelligible for almost the whole film! You watch the film and your loyalties for the characters changes as the film progresses, basically wondering how it can work out OK for all the characters, you won't be disappointed by the ending though.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|Unfortunately, I can't give a review for this movie.  The disc will not play in my DVD player or my computer.  I received one and returned it after it wouldn't play.  Unfortunately, the second one has the same issue.  It is not my player because I have no problem with other DVDs.
B001DDBCUU|3.0|I thought writer/director Michael Patrick King did a fairly good job here delivering a quality product vs. the significant pressure from the audience who pretty much demanded this film.  Who can argue with its success?  Almost $400M in worldwide box office on a production budget of $65M falls well beyond the category of 'rousing success'.  The results dispelled a lot of naysayers predicting that the product couldn't translate to the big screen.<br /><br />I say \\"fairly good\\" because my quibble with the film come from its almost-complete washing out of its male characters.  Chris Noth's 'Big' has his place of course. But my favorite character, 'Steve' (David Eigenberg), is turned into a one-trick pony as a stammering adulterer.  Eigenberg's Steve was known for his inherent likability, even in the face of an often non-likable Miranda.  I was surprised King would simply cash that in so easily.<br /><br />As for Evan Handler's 'Harry' and Jason Lewis' 'Smith', they're taken out of the picture by King more effectively than any Soviet painter ordered to remove purged Politburo members from the Red Square lineup.  Handler had maybe three lines; Lewis had little beyond \\"Hi, babe\\" and dodging flying sushi.<br /><br />The other slightly humorous part of the product was the banishment of Kim Catrall's 'Samantha' character to LA.  Surely, the slow-boil off-screen feud between Catrall and SJP played some role in that development.  It reminded me of [[ASIN:B00000K3CS Broadcast News]] where Holly Hunter's producer character assigns a putative romantic rival to cover a story in Greenland.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout.  I love that it is only 20 minutes because it is easy to find 20 minutes sometime in your day.  Even though it is only 20 minutes, it is a very challenging workout and you will feel it the next day.  I like that Jillian has some modified moves for beginners like myself. I also like that she pushes you not to give up.  Sometimes we need that extra push!! On days I feel extra energized, I also do Leslie's 3 mile walk.
B0000009SE|5.0|Within Zappa's catalog, this recording doesn't seem to get the respect it should. Often overshadowed by \\"The Grand Wazoo,\\" the earlier \\"Waka/Jawaka\\" is relegated to a sort of second place within Zappa's fusion jazz experiments. Although on this site, users have overwhelmingly awarded this recording with five stars, other sites and bloggers give it three. But \\"Waka/Jawaka\\" is no less brilliant than \\"The Grand Wazoo.\\"<br /><br />You have the theme introduced quickly with \\"Big Swifty,\\" and then the composition proceeds with the many variations on that theme, including the usual instrument solos common with jazz performances. The song bursts upon your ears and swiftly glides from one syncopated rhythm to another, returning an almost cosmic jazz sound with George Duke's first solo on the electric piano. Soon enters Sal Marquez on muted trumpet and the sound is complete, very reminiscent of Miles Davis in \\"Bitches Brew.\\"<br /><br />It's like Sal Marquez playing Miles Davis, but Marquez is doing more than recalling Davis' style. Rather, it sounds more like Sal Marquez playing Miles Davis who is playing Sal Marquez playing Zappa's \\"Big Swifty.\\" And that is neat.<br /><br />Zappa's guitar, which up till the end of Marquez's solo acted as a punctuation to the music, comes forward in quintessential Zappa style. It carries a bit of a Spanish flair to it as well that blends well with the overall feel of the piece.<br /><br />And then the piece repeats the theme, which usually occurs at the end of compositions like this. But Zappa doesn't \\"end\\" the piece as neatly as that; hence the brain becomes engaged and begins to ask, \\"What is all this?\\" And what it is is Tony Duran's slide guitar solo. It is brilliant, because just as the listener's ear, conditioned by years and years of jazz compositions, and even classical compositions, is about to say \\"ahh, that was nice,\\" the piece picks up and drolls on to a conclusion that is not only interesting, but suitable as well.<br /><br />When the theme is reintroduced just after the 13-minute mark of this 17:22 song, there is a real sense of return and set up for the finale.<br /><br />And then comes \\"Your Mouth.\\" What is this? Not only is this tonally very different from the expansive \\"Big Swifty,\\" it has lyrics! Someone is singing! From fusion, Zappa easily slips into a 12-bar blues piece that has just a hint of New Orleans gospel to my ear. We go Western with \\"It Just Might Be a One Shot Deal,\\" complete with slide guitar and a short burst of music that recalls the themes from many a 1950's cowboy television show. And all the while the slide guitar is dreamily carrying on the tune toward the end, I can see graceful couples dancing to country swing.<br /><br />The title track launches into an expansive intro with the theme laid out and reminiscent of, perhaps, a 1950s era Western movie, or maybe even a detective show from television, like \\"Hawaii Five-O.\\" It just has this kitschy feel to it. Preston on the Mini-Moog seems to be dropping hints that are more strongly revealed in \\"The Grand Wazoo.\\" Namely, hints at the future direction of Zappa's music. It's almost a prototype of \\"One Size Fits All.\\"<br /><br />Zappa's guitar solo at the end goes through some outrageous rhythm changes, but Ansley Dunbar's drumming effectively keeps pace, adjusting as needed, and when the horn section blasts in, Dunbar keeps the rhythm on track, then finishes with a respectful solo of his own. The theme returns with a thunderous \\"da-toom, da-toom, da-do-do-do- do-toom.\\" The addition of flute at this point really a nice point, as well as the staccato piccolo accompanying the same staccato from the horns. The song fades to completion, recalling an image of a cowboy, perhaps, riding off into the desert, or if we go with the detective show theme, a helicopter shot looking down but fading back from the busy streets of L.A. I like the cowboy movie theme better myself.e 13-minute mark of this 17:22 song, there is a real sense of return and set up for the finale.    And then comes \\"Your Mouth.\\" What is this?

0393057240|5.0|After reading Trainspotting I had to ask myself what else I've been missing. The main characters are addicts, junkies, heavy drinkers and a sicko or two, with heroin as the star here. It's an alien culture to me, but I just couldn't put the book down, dialect and all. I also have no clue about this subculture of underclass in 1980s Scotland, but Welsh writes it as if he's been there and followed this group of people around. I won't go into the plot here (there are lots of places you can find info on this book), but at times I was horrified to find myself actually laughing in the midst of what seemed several pointless and hopeless situations - in appreciation of some scenes of incredibly black humor. At the same time, I found myself getting into the characters emotionally, seeing them as people who are disenfranchised on many levels. Welsh does a superb job of capturing the anger, boredom and disconnection of his characters (who come off as being very real) showing both the positives & negatives of friendship & other emotional connections in a series of small, connected vignettes, told in chronological order.  Very well written; I highly recommend it. If you get stuck while reading it, there's a glossary in the back; I found myself at least at first trying the dialect orally and after a while it wasn't even noticeable and the book flowed. Readers of Palahniuk or other writers who have the ability to capture the rage of a generation might enjoy this one, but this book is definitely not for everyone.
B000W1V5OC|5.0|This review refers to the single disc version of the DVD.  Out of all the live concert dvds I've seen, Nightwish's End of An Era is hands down the best of them all. I can pretty much watch this over and over and never get bored with it. The band gives everything they got for this final night of the Once tour with amazing vocals by Tarja and Marco, pyrotechnics, video screens, and a special guest. My favorite parts were Phantom Of the Opera (10x better here than on the album Century Child), which shows just how powerful Tarja's vocals are, Ghost Love Score, The Kingslayer, and Sleeping Sun. I admit I get a bit sad once the ending comes on because that is when we all know it will be the last time this lineup of Nightwish will ever be on stage together.  The bonus features include a 55 min documentary of the months leading up to this last concert which is subtitled in english. A bit dissapointing cause they could've included the music videos for Nemo and Wish I Had An Angel.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I personally don't find this show scary, but it is intriguing, never boring and seriously cool.  There is something to be said for heros that essentially offer their lives for the good of mankind which is somewhat of a recurring theme in other shows that I have liked such as BTVS and Angel.  I love this show so much that I bought a second copy just in case the original purchase ever wears out.  This show is simply the best that television has to offer today.  Enjoy it I do.
0743289692|5.0|This book opened my eyes to the truth of the world we all live in now - a world that is smaller than we think and much more evil and more perilous.  It is the only book I have ever read that truly explains the reason for the 9/11 attack in a way that makes sense and is believable. It opens our vision to the future and to what we can know it will be. I feel that I not only will never think in the same way, I will never be the same. At the same time it portrays amazing courage and is absolutely inspiring, especially so to all young women everywhere.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The first season was fantastic and the 2nd season maintained the same standards, this is simply the best show on television.  Lets face it these brothers rock.  Never boring always exciting and always cool.  Pop in a disc turn the key and enjoy the ride, you'll be glad you did.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I had previous editions of the four movies. I liked the movies when I saw them on the theaters. Now I have the four theatrical realeses and the directors cut and extra disc with lots of nice extra material. Something that I like a lot was the sound. And the uncut version of alien 3 was much better than the theatrical realese.
031606792X|5.0|THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS    This book actually left me with the kind of feeling that I hoped for out of the other three books.   The pulling together of so many disparate characters, to save an innocent, whether or not they had any familial connection to the accused, is of more import than whether or not they actually had to lay down their lives to guard that life.   It is the willingness to stand as a witness in the face of certain death (and in this case dismemberment) that is the important feature of the book.    That is the heart of the book,for me at least.   I compare it to real life and find that it is compatible.    To think that each time that we are willing to sacrifice any part of ourselves for another, and when we, in the end, do not have to do so, is some sort of failure is just...well naive. And disturbing.     Note: If the finally-married-and-in-love scene is too much for you to handle, then by all means go find another book.
B000NA28I4|1.0|I bought this book, read it, and enjoyed it.  Of course it's not 100% original, but it was good.  Then I heard that they were making a film adaptation of the book.  I was not worried, \\"if a teenager can write a book this good then just wait till the professionals get a hold of it.\\"  Boy was I wrong, more like \\"look how the pros ruin a teens perfectly good novel\\".  That said, the portions of the book that were in the movie were fairly good and I enjoyed them - however a 1 1/2 hour movie just does not cover a novel of this length.  It would have been very easy to make this into a 2 - 2 1/2 hour movie, I know I would have watched it.  It is very unfortunate that this film adaptation was ruined simply because everything was kicked into hyperdrive and no one had time to enjoy the movie.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|When i heard about Donuts, i didnt know much about dill (jay dee) or anything about him, i think. As i was at home, bored, i went on limewire and i downloaded Bye, and Two can win. honestly i never heard of nothing like it. No hook, no raps, no basic structure of a regular \\"hip-hop\\" song.  but it was hip-hop. I felt it, ya know?  i played those two songs until i got tired of them, which took awhile. I listen to music that becomes a part of my life, in which i choose wisely. I downloaded the cd off of the internet like 3 months later and i played the cd out.  I purchased It shortly after.   cd's nowadays are hard to consider purchasing because we all know about the current state of the quality of music. in short, you cant just go and buy a cd (at least to me)  this cd became a part of my life, so i had to buy it  the cd is not something where you can skip tracks. you HAVE to play it in its entirety. if you dont, you're missing out on how it all gels together. He makes songs out of nothing, ya kno. if you listen to what he sampled, it's crazy on how he reworked it.   It's simple, but quite clever.  and once you get comfy with one song, another track just pops outta nowhere.   Its original, its quality, its a album that wont get old no time soon.   I also reccomend Entroducing  I definitely reccomend it to those who appreciate good music.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I have booked a flight to Guernsey.  I want to be there for the next literary meeting.
078322737X|5.0|What a glorious, nostalgic, and ultimately melancholy movie this is.  It ranks in my top five, maybe top three films of all time.  I saw this meditation on early '60s California again the other night on the big screen, and realized from the other men in the audience, and from my wife's ho-hum reaction, that American Graffiti appeals mostly to and is about men.    The hot rod cars are the first tip-off of course, and \\"cruising the strip\\" as street rodder Milner calls it (we used to call it \\"cruising Broadway\\") while answering drag challenges and scoping out girls are the main night activities.  It's a heady and uncertain time, this one night the movie concentrates on.  Curt and Steve (Richard Dreyfuss and Ron Howard)are due to leave town for college the next morning, and Curt's getting cold feet.  You can't help but feel the exciting tug of the unknown in one direction and yet understand the comfort of the routine and the familiar in wanting to stay home.  Anyone who left home for the big world as a teenager will understand very well what's going on in these guys' minds.    John Milner is supposedly content to remain hot rod king of the hill, but he seems defensive about Curt moving on.  Curt gets into and out of trouble with the local toughs the \\"Pharaohs,\\" while the characters of the outstanding ensemble cast go through their own little triumphs and failures in the night.  In a piece of inspired casting Wolfman Jack is a running background theme throughout the movie, except for the part when he takes center stage when Curt asks him to broadcast a message for a beautiful woman (Suzanne Somers) who's been cruising around town.      What guy doesn't have some bittersweet memory of some gorgeous gal he couldn't or wouldn't approach?  George Lucas captures the sentiment precisely, especially at the end after sunrise when Curt on the plane sees her one last time, driving way below him in her white T-Bird.     It all works.  The great '50s music, Toad's (Charles Martin Smith) fumbling escapades with Debbie (Candy Clark), the showdown that caps the escalating encounters between Milner and the new hot rodder in town, Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford), the warm California night, the splits and reconciliations, Carol's (Mackenzie Phillips) funny and argumentative night riding with Milner, the end and beginning of an era individually and collectively.    Why did Lucas title the movie \\"American Graffiti\\"?  Perhaps because graffiti is transitory.  Being impermanent, one has to record it to save it.  Perhaps he meant to say that graffiti is the writing on the wall, that the culture he so deeply portrays in this movie is in just a couple of years going to vanish, replaced by a hippie culture so radically different as to seem utterly alien.  In 1962 the Korean war was a remote memory, and the Vietnam mess only the size of a man's fist on the horizon.  The teenagers in this movie are coming of age in a fairly carefree era, one on the cusp of revolution in society and morals, an era that will end suddenly and pretty much completely in a brief time.    After seeing all that happened in the movie that one night, you might get an ache in the gut of differing emotions seeing the fates of several of the characters posted on the foreground of Curt's plane flying high.  Rolling the credits with the Beach Boys's \\"All Summer Long\\" was perfect.  I can't think of the song now without that mix of nostalgia, melancholy, and humor this movie inspires.      Where was I in '62?  In the upper Midwest, a little boy.  But it would've been fun to be in California on a soft summer's night, the entire future ahead of me.
B00008G6EZ|4.0|I have only one beef with this performance: instead of a statue, the Commendatore's gravestone is a large black abstract sculpture, and during the dinner scene DonG tries to feed a small replica of it (actually wipes its \\"mouth\\" with a napkin).<br /><br />Also in the first scene Matti Salminen shakes his buttocks at the audience in a completely inappropriate way.<br /><br />Other than that it's great.
031606792X|1.0|I was a HUGE fan of the first three books.  I forced my friends, family, and coworkers to read them and fall in love with them too.  I was so attached to the characters, I thought about them constantly when I had to put the book down.  And all I have to say about Breaking Dawn is WTF.  I kept reading going, \\"Oh no!\\"  \\"What the...\\"  and finally, \\"This is terrible.\\"  The characters all took a turn for the worst.  Made the worst possible decisions.  And no one faced consequences.    Edward and Bella got to be down right annoying.  And, I have to say....  as much as I loved Edward and Bella in the beginning, I ended up on \\"team jacob.\\"  I loved Jacob Black, and I wanted Edward to get his heart smashed into a million cold little pieces.  Not because I hated him, though.  I thought it served him right.  He caused Bella a lot of pain.  Jacob patched her back up, and then she shat on him.  NOW BELLA--a selfish, childish teenager turned to ecstatic young mother and wife?  WTF?  TURNING TO ROSALIE?  The girl who hated her most...and was villainized throughout the whole pregnancy as pretty much waiting for Bella to die so she could have the baby.    The child birth?  Are you kidding me?  Edward CHEWING the baby out of her.  Ugh ugh ugh. I was waiting for the book to redeem itself when Jacob killed the baby...but......no such luck. I honestly could not even finish it.  As soon as Jacob imprinted on the baby, I shut the book and could have puked.  He was so in love/lust with Bella....then this vampire hybrid turns out to be his destiny.  BAH!  There needed to be more to it than that.     I get the argument, \\"but he was never in love with Bella, or he would have imprinted on her...\\"  I never thought that was the case.  I always felt it was something akin to a defense mechanism because he always knew she'd chose Edward.    I was pro Bella being a vampire until the end of Eclipse.  I could actually FEEL Bella's emotional pain and the rip of her two waring sides....the writing was amazing, and it made me change my mind.  And i felt NOTHING  but disgust during Breaking Dawn.  No emotion.  No climax. Just plain weird.     A \\"happy ending,\\" but at what cost for the series?
B000UC9OJG|4.0|A best of Laura Pausini! I wish the image quality of the recorded material was a bit better but it's generally about the music, not the video and the music is top if you know and like Laura.
1591841666|5.0|You will get better at anything you attempt if you put in the effort. After a while you will need to put in more and more effort for less and less gain. If you stick to your guns you will emerge as one of the few experts at whatever it is you chose to do. If you don't stick to your guns you should quit fast before you put in too much effort for the gain you will get before quitting.<br /><br />That is pretty much the entire message of the book. However, it is delivered in typical Seth Godin style with witty pithy observations and some astute criteria that will help the reader to decide when to invest the effort and when to cut their losses and run. In addition to `the dip' of its title the book also describes two other curves that sum up most of my life's experience: the cul-de-sac where you just can't make progress no matter how much effort you put in, and the cliff, where effort is rewarded until sudden catastrophe strikes.<br /><br />Anyone who has attempted to break into the world of the professional non-executive director will be familiar with the dip. At first it is all so easy, you work, you get qualified, you start to gain experience and then WHAM, the dip happens. This is where your hard-won experience and qualifications just aren't enough to get you that important first paid directorship. This is where people start to say `stick with it for two years and if it hasn't happened by then you should give up'. Seth says that is rot and I believe him. If you are going to give up, give up now before you waste any more effort. If, like me, you are determined to succeed, then love that dip. It is the dip that will eventually separate you from your competitors when you come out the other side and they quit trying right where the dip gets steepest.<br /><br />The dip analogy works for everything from losing weight to becoming a champion golfer. The discussion of how to tell if you are approaching a dip, a cul-de-sac or a cliff edge is a bit lacking in specific differentiators. Even so; this is a helpful and practical book that gave me plenty of `Ah Ha' moments.<br /><br />There is a shocking error on page 19, where Seth talks about the `unchecked'  decision-making power of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. But, apart from thus insulting about three thousand fortune 500 company directors, this book makes non stop sense.<br /><br />Did I like `The Purple Cow' more? Yes. That was a cute and sweet little book. This book is useful; more of a workhorse than `the cow'. It is a well observed analysis that I shall probably return to again and again. I know I will enjoy re-reading it and will find something new to apply it to every time I return to its pages.is a helpful and practical book that gave me plenty of `Ah Ha' moments.

B000MCH5P4|1.0|This is a perfect example of what happens when a decent idea is poorly developed.  A shame.<br /><br />We waited for it--it being the plot, and characters worth caring about.  And now that the movie is over, we are still waiting.  Even though there were several interesting aspects, overall it was a waste of the concept.

Weird as it sounds, I actually feel betrayed by the author - betrayed because I came to know and love the characters in the series, and I feel like this book did not do them justice. It seemed to not even be about the same people.     The obviously thorough character development in the earlier books had built characters I cared about and could sympathize with. There was very little left of the qualities I had come to love about each of them and their complex relationships with each other. The formula that created magic in the other books was completely gone.     Maybe the author decided to go out on a limb and try something different, but I felt like she did not honor the integrity of what she had previouisly written, nor the intelligence of her readers. Even the \\"voice\\" of the book seemed to have changed.     The situations were beyond unbelievable (and downright disturbing in some cases), even for fantasy fiction. Several times it seemed the author had written herself into a corner and then, *poof* she fixed it with some lame rationale. Other times, the book read like the Winchester Mystery House, with undeveloped plot points like staircases leading to nowhere. But worse than that, I just didn't even care how things turned out. Maybe that's because the core story of Edward and Bella and the Bella/Jacob dynamic were what I found so compelling, and this was not their story. I'm actually not sure whose story it was, it was so disjointed and overly verbose. Where was the editor??    The middle section was somewhat less painful to read I suppose, because Jacob's point of view was at least more entertaining. I was amused by the titles of his chapters. But I cannot count how many times I slogged along wondering to myself how many more pages until something interesting happened. Around page 500 or so, I remember asking myself how thiscould possibly go on for another 250 pages, it seemed so pointless and overly drawn out. And what the heck was up with introducting a couple dozen new characters 3/4 of the way through, complete with agonizingly boring descriptions and a Who's Who appendix? As if I even cared about keeping them all straight at that point.     One last trivial complaint. The name Renesmee was completely ridiculous to the point of distraction. I tried to skim over it, but it grated on me and made me dislike anything to do with the character by sheer association. Seriously - Renesmee?? Somebody offer that kid up to the Volturi already and put her out of her misery.     I will say that I liked the ending (and I do mean the VERY ending), for reasons other than the book was finally over. It was there, on the last three pages, that I finally found a trace of the Edward and Bella dynamic a la the first three books. Of course, I would have liked it better if Bella had woken up and realized the whole load of crap was an unpleasant dream, leaving me with a glimmer of hope that maybe somewhere out there in fictionland the entire series didn't go entirely and irreparably south. But alas, that was the one corner the author didn't glibly write herself out of.     If, like me, you feel you must complete the series against all advice, read the first 110 pages for the romantic payoff before the author's obvious mental breakdown, and then skip to the last three pages, where it appears her meds have kicked in.     As for me, I wish I had heeded the advice of my teenage daughter, a self-proclaimed \\"Twihard\\" - \\"Let's pretend it was a trilogy.\\"
B000T9OP7G|5.0|This show is a continuation of the \\"Terminator\\" story and takes place after the second movie.  It is great fun, and avoids the pitfalls of transferring a movie franchise to television.    Casting is wonderful.  While Summer Glau clearly deserves acclaim for her portrayal of a character which bridges the human/machine divide, performers playing the other main (and even secondary) characters have certainly also delivered.    The writing is smart, and character and plot development have been genuinely interesting: there are no flat action television characters here.    There are a few flaws, such as spotty performance by some \\"guest terminators\\", and occasional unnecessary technological explanation.
031606792X|1.0|This probably will contain ***SPOILERS*****     I liked the first 3 books despite the sub standard writing, Meyer's story telling worked for me.  The story grabbed me enough to keep me interested in what the future may hold for S. Meyer's characters.    Unlike many reviewers here, I don't care about the so called `moral issues'- It's fiction.  Frankly, more disturbing things happen in the `real world'  Even the imprinting didn't shock and disturb me.  Nor the issue of killing `it' a.k.a. Bella & Edward's  baby ...(possible dangerous monster ) Her being pregnant baffled me a bit.  I read it as fiction not analyzing all this weird stuff that happens with Meyer's characters in   Breaking Dawn, more.... `WHY?'    In my opinion, this last book just tanked. I found it just dragged and dragged.......    The characters Ms. Meyer's developed got lost.  The pull for me in the first 3 books was the relationship  between Bella & Edward.  This relationship dynamic was practically non existent in Breaking Dawn...    It went from a decent enough series to some sort of freak show. Freak show to, `Happily ever after' Huh?  Meyer's characters, HER characters were so inconsistent in this last book, I was left feeling like...  like I started reading some half way decent vampire fiction series that turned into a very freaked out romance novel.  I detest romance novels!  I felt duped.      I walked away from Breaking Dawn really disliking Bella.  She turns into a vampire that is now a supernatural multi-talented super model?  She grew taller too?  The transformation from human Bella to vampire Bella was tooooooo easy and way over the top, not likable to me in any way. Most important, not believable based on Meyer's   own details of Bella.     \\"I'm prego, I have no problem sucking down a few sippy cups of blood even though a frigging paper cut would normally cause me to pass out cold on the floor. I love Edward but I won't talk to anyone except `Rose' cause she will support what I want right now...  Jacob's my best friend, he loves me, everybody loves me...  I'll save the day AND you can imprint my baby cause you love me so much that this seems like a cool thing to still have you in my life.  If I wasn't all vamped out with this nifty shield thing, you'd all be toast. \\"  I was an immature lovesick teenager, now I'm that... only better! I have super powers  that fix everything.  It doesn't matter that I put myself and others in danger throughout  the story.... I'm a magic shield now....  \\"    Yikes!  Kind-of couldn't help that rant. Sorry everyone.... But, Breaking Dawn has inspired me to change writing direction without warning.  heehee ;-)    I no longer cared if Bella had a happy ending, which wasn't the case prior to Breaking Dawn.      I've read other reviews here, many addressing the areas where Ms. Meyer's lost the characters SHE developed.  I agree with that as being a major problem throughout Breaking Dawn.  I also did not like the complete lack of growth of Bella as a young women.   I honestly wish I didn't read Breaking Dawn.  I, like others here feel book three should be the end after reading this mess.      I love the caption one reviewer here put, \\"Can you unread a book?\\"   If only.......
B001EN71DG|5.0|The original trilogy deserves 5 stars, however, assuming this is just the same thing in a new box, it's getting old. I agree that Lucas has been rehashing and rehashing and needs to get it right, put it on blu ray, and be done with all of the fixing.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|This soundtrack is a great way to recall the movie and while in the original spirit of the songs the vocals are clearly different than the original ABBA recordings.  My advice is to own both the original recordings and the movie soundtrack. The only reason the album didn't get 5 stars was that it did leave out songs from the movie including a big encore number that comes up after the credits and there doesn't seem to have been any good reason for doing so.
031606792X|4.0|Although I agree that it IS a bit irritating that all the characters get exactly what they want, don't you think most of you are being a bit hard on the book? I mean...Fictional stories are supposed to be able to take you outside of your reality and put you into a world where anything can happen. That's the fun of Fiction, you can escape your life for another, more unrealistic one. Yes, Bella did get pregnant at 18, but I'm 17 and it doesn't make me feel like it's \\"okay\\" to get pregnant right now. I think we fans should be more mature than that and honestly? I think we ARE more mature than that. We aren't idiots. And the issue about Jacob imprinting on the baby? Wasn't that written about in the previous books? That a werewolf could imprint on even an infant and the feelings toward it aren't sexual; they just want the child to be happy and healthy. I don't think it's that weird, it's actually understandable. He imprinted on a child from the girl he loved. I get it and it's not as \\"creepy\\" as people make it seem. Anyway... no matter how many 1 star reviews the books gets, I love the Twilight series and I still give Breaking Dawn 4 stars.

031606792X|1.0|She really should have stopped at book number three. I wonder if her new fame went to her head and she forgot how to write well. This book was such a huge disapointment. I really got to the point that I did not care how it ended. I actually skipped a few chapters and I could barely read the sappy last chapter. I hope the Twilight movie is not this bad.

B001EN71DG|1.0|Okay George, really.  Enough is enough.  Stop the fleecing already!  If you and your companies aren't going to take the PROPER restoration and remixing of these films seriously, then PLEASE STOP with these partially done, weak attempts!  Are there going to be even MORE \\"fixes\\" in this collection?  What needs to happen is a final, archival edition of these films, with ANAMORPHIC transfers of how they were originally shown in 1977, 1980, and 1983.  ALL of the LaserDisc materials and EVERYTHING should be included.  And DON'T make it a rush job like the 2004 set!  The folks that worked on the 2004 set created as many problems as they tried to fix!  It's time to REALLY give these films what they deserve, Mr. Lucas.  I'm willing to bet that this set is just a new package of the same 'ol same 'ol.  PLEASE for the love of whatever you may find to be Holy, DO WHAT IS RIGHT!  Get that 1954 recording of the Fox Fanfare outta there, fix the flanging audio during the title crawl, fix the flanging audio during the Emperor's arrival, fix the X-WING flyby that occurs when the Millennium Falcon is facing the four TIE Fighters, replace the optical effects with ALL DIGITAL, interject Vader's theme in Episode IV (all five other films have it and makes it feel out of place), get the color timing right on the lightsaber blades, digitally paint out the squib on the rail that Luke cuts with his lightsaber.... My God I can go on.  If I can see and hear all the flaws, then SOMEBODY'S gotta be aware of it!  Grab Ben Burtt, Lowry Digital Images, John Williams (although there is plenty of unused music to draw from), and get it going the RIGHT way.  It is a true shame that these films suffer from a lack of the very technology they pioneered!  C'mon, George!
B00004TRD8|5.0|Terminator 2 is one of the most memorable movies ever made. You can go years without watching this, but remember almost every scene when you finally see it again. This is real close to being a masterpiece, and it probably is. The special effects for the movie are still amazing even by today's standards. To me, the most memorable scene is when Sarah has the vision of the city being blown away, only leave skeletons in a fiery inferno. It is a really scary and somewhat realistic scene of what could happen to us if we aren't careful in the future. Not that machines will cause our demise, but we ourselves will. That is the message of the movie, that violence is \\"in our nature\\".<br /><br />The story is incredible. The Terminator becomes the dad that John never had and you really feel it while watching. The acting is also great and the end of the movie is a real tear jerker. This is a have-to-see movie if you haven't seen it already. This movie is so big, it's weird if you haven't seen it yet. You've been missing out. For those who have seen it, this is the movie to get and you will love it as much as you always have.<br /><br />The Ultimate Edition DVD is the choice to get and watching the Special Edition of the movie is a must because it has new scenes that only add to the already great story. Pick this up :)

1400032717|2.0|I bought this book after reading all of the massive amounts of praise that has been lavished upon it. I have to say, these praises are not deserved and I am completely baffled how this novel achieved such a status. I found myself struggling to keep reading because I knew this book was going nowhere.    First it starts with a halfway entertaining plot about the dog being killed. \\"Ok. Fine,\\" I'm thinking. \\"Surely this will lead to something else.\\" And it does, but it was a very frustrating read because of all the tangents the boy takes to tell about all of these completely pointless things. I understand the kid is autistic, and maybe that's how they really think. I don't know. But I do know that if that is how they think, it doesn't make for a very good book. I found myself just kind of scanning through whole chapters because I knew they had nothing to do with the plot at all and really didn't teach anyone anything unless you didn't complete middle school.     \\"But wait!\\" Some may say. \\"This book provides insight into how autistic kids think.\\" Ok fine, maybe it does. But like I said, that doesn't make it a good book. I think people just like this book because it's considered \\"eccentric\\" and \\"different\\" and they like it for the same reason people like \\"Juno\\" and movies like that...they're just not as good as people make them out to be.
031606792X|1.0|Last year in my middle school classroom, I kept seeing one student after another hunched over a copy of one of Stephenie Meyer's novels, oblivious to the outside world and almost devouring every page.  This summer I decided to discover what the appeal was all about.  Although I have to agree with Meyer herself that she is more a \\"storyteller\\" than a \\"writer,\\" I nonetheless found much to appreciate in the first three novels.  But with each book in the trilogy, I felt a great uneasiness beginning to grow as Bella (the series heroine) seemed increasingly eager to give up her human life.  Still, Meyer created powerful metaphors in those first three novels that she sadly abandoned in BREAKING DAWN, the final--and for me, hugely disappointing--conclusion to her series.        The TWILIGHT series (especially Book I) has many strengths: A vivid sense of place, riveting and fast-paced episodes of danger and confrontation (one of Meyer's finest gifts), honest characterization (especially of Bella, who is a touching mixture of insecurity and wisdom).  But Meyer's greatest accomplishment is capturing the intensity, longing, and passion of a great love--especially, a first love.  Bella is every young teenager who doubts his or her abilities and desirability; she is every young person who has quietly and achingly loved from afar the most beautiful person in school, convinced this love will remain unrequited.  Eventually, when she discovers that Edward is a vampire, she becomes a person who desires, beyond reason, the dangerous but irresistible individual who could be her undoing.        These are the rich metaphors Meyer develops in the first three novels--teenage insecurity, unrequited love, and later, almost unbearable longing for a person who is perhaps totally (even dangerously) the wrong person to love.  Later, Meyer creates in Jacob (Bella's other romantic attachment, who turns out to be a \\"shape-shifter\\") a metaphor for the teen who is almost overwhelmed by physical and emotional changes occurring too fast and furiously to be comprehended.  How Bella, Jacob, and Edward could have handled their fears and longings--in other words, how Meyer could have developed her metaphors--might have culminated in a healthy definition of maturity.  Bella could have come to realize that outer beauty is not what makes us desirable, that sometimes we love (and must ultimately give up) a person who is all wrong for us.  Jacob, given time and compassion, could have learned to deal with the changes in himself.  Edward could have come to see that in renouncing his claim on Bella he revealed a selfless love that gave her the gift of growth, life, and maturation.  However, in BREAKING DAWN, these metaphors never come to fruition and Bella makes life-altering (eventually, life-rejecting) decisions that freeze her in a perpetual state of pre-adulthood.    BREAKING DAWN has a kind of prurience that the other novels avoided.  The passionate longing of the first three books was deep, believable, and intense.  In BREAKING DAWN Meyer swings from telling us more than we want to know about Bella's and Edward's lovemaking, to cutesifying their passion with talk of black and pink lingerie.  That same overly-precious quality is also evident in the saccharine descriptions of their wedding.  Characters that had been mysteriously intriguing and fascinating in all of their complexity, suddenly become commonplace (later in the novel, when Esme is relegated to the role of casserole-maker, I had to laugh).  In most vampire fiction, these creatures function as the \\"other,\\"--unknowable, untamable creatures who represent the uncontrollable elements in our own human nature.  Once tamed and domesticated, there is only one way to make them seem wild and untamable and that is to turn them into growling, snarling animals.  That is precisely what Meyer is forced to do.  Neither extreme--homebody nor feral beast--is attractive or compelling.    Most important, however, is the fear thatis a subversive motivation for all of Bella's decisions in this final novel.  Bella chooses to be a vampire so that she will be more physically beautiful for all eternity, more \\"equal\\" to Edward in physical attractiveness.  She says at one point, \\"After eighteen years of mediocrity, I was pretty used to being average.  I realized now that I'd long ago given up any aspirations of shining at anything.  I just did the best with what I had, never quite fitting into my world.\\"  Doing \\"the best with what [we have]\\" is the challenge for all human beings.  Growth, developing potential--this is the essential hope at the core of the human condition.  To awaken one day with superhuman beauty, strength, and sensory capacity is a child's dream, and yet, it is one of Bella's motives for choosing to become a vampire because she is afraid to remain less attractive than the vampiric Cullens.  Bella never learns to accept herself as a human with limitations; she opts, instead, for stonelike physical perfection that will never alter, as if to indicate that love can only endure as long as physical beauty endures.    The entire novel also seems to fear any kind of physical passion unless it occurs within the traditional sanctions of marriage.  I have no problem with Bella's and Edward's decision to wait to have sex until they are married; however, I do have problems with Bella's being married at the age of eighteen, to someone who will selfishly rob her of life so that they can be together forever.  Likewise, Jacob's \\"imprinting\\" on the infant Renesmee (something that still strikes me as almost perverted and at the very least discomfiting) takes away any physical temptations he might feel for other females, thus ensuring his celibacy until the time when Renesmee is old enough to marry him.  The Meyer books may seem, on the surface, to be iconoclastic, but the values underpinning the narrative are decidedly conservative.  I suspect that Meyer realized that the decisions Bella makes in the final novel are open to much criticism, and to justify Bella's entry into the vampire world, Meyer marries her off and gives her a baby to ferociously protect and defend (a pregnancy, by the way, which seems completely impossible since vampires do not appear to have the capacity to manufacture bodily fluids).  Thus, any reader who criticizes Bella's decision to give up her human existence is placed in the uncomfortable position of seeming to criticize commitment, marriage, family, and motherhood!  Nonetheless, I do criticize this direction of BREAKING DAWN and have to admit that no amount of respect for family values can allow me to embrace Bella's decision to exist forever as one of the undead.  Nor can this emphasis on \\"family values\\" distract the reader from the grotesqueness of much of the novel (for example, Bella's carrying around her blood-filled plastic cup, which she sips through a bent straw; and the child's ripping her mother apart from the inside out).  Also, in focusing on Bella's defense of her new family, Meyer creates a situation where Bella actually rejects a connection with her own mother and father.  Meyer explains away Bella's separation from her mother by stating that Renee (Bella's mother) is \\"busy\\" with her second marriage, and the incomplete explanation that Bella gives Charlie about her new married life and changed appearance is unconvincing and never fully developed.           The maudlin and overly-cute episodes at the beginning of BREAKING DAWN; the over-reliance on a kind of forced humor in the dialogue; the stripping away of the intriguing mystery surrounding the vampires (especially Edward); the refusal to develop metaphors that might have ended up teaching valuable lessons about self-acceptance, selfless renunciation, and maturation; the truly grotesque section dealing with Bella's pregnancy; and the almost perverted concept of \\"imprinting\\" make it impossible for me to embrace this final novel.  The family values exalted in the novel cannot excuse Bella's decision to join the vampire world rather than embrace a flawed human existence that nonetheless allows the hope of development, growth, and true maturation.  BREAKING DAWN does have some strengths.  The section told from Jacob's point of view is strong; his voice is real and believable and a refreshing change.  Also, the confrontation with the Volturi at the end of the novel is engrossing and well-paced, the kind of scene that spotlights Meyer at her best.  Ultimately, however, I have to say that Meyer mines riches in her first three novels, but she throws them away in BREAKING DAWN.  Bella is a bright girl.  I suspect that most bright girls would not choose eternal death-in-life because they are incapable of accepting their human flaws and weaknesses.  Bella chooses death over life; a coven over the world.  In BREAKING DAWN her existence narrows, not expands.  Such a shame.  Such a waste.

B00003CXB4|5.0|I love this film for the five main reasons. Reason 1: I like all the characters in this except Scar, the main baddie. He annoys me just slightly (although I like his voice). Reason 2: The scenery portrays a beautiful vision of Africa and it makes me feel like I'm really there. Reason 3: The plot is very beautiful and it has made me want to read \\"Hamlet\\" on which the plot was based! Reason 4: This film has beautiful songs! My favourite is \\"Can You Feel The Love Tonight?\\" (written by Elton John) but I love all the others as well. Reason 5: I love the voices that were picked for all the characters. I especially like the sound of Jeremy Iron's (Scar), Rowan Atkinson's (Zazu), Nathan Lane's (Timon), Whoopi Goldberg's (Shenzi), James Earl Jones's (Mufasa) and Moira Kelly's (adult Nala) voices! Bouncy musical numbers from Elton John and Tim Rice,a nice, gentle,humored script by Irene Mecchi and Jonathan Roberts and directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff make this animated film more than a kid-friendly treatment of Hamlet. (If memory serves,I believe Mr.Minkoff went on to direct and/or produce the Broadway production as well) The musical numbers may be approaching saccharine sweet and the plot and characters may seem all too familiar now,but it's still quality entertainment,pure and simple. While the enjoyment or entertainment value of Disney animation may vary from person-to-person,it's tough to argue that in a five-year,four movie span(The Little Mermaid,Beauty and the Beast,Aladdin and this film)the strength and vitality of the storied Mouse franchise.
B000VNMMR0|2.0|I really wish they'd stop making sequels of movies from long ago. [[ASIN:B000KJU1KK The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning]], [[ASIN:B000I0RNVQ Clerks II]], [[ASIN:B0015XHP2C Rambo]], [[ASIN:B000N4SHPS Rocky Balboa]], [[ASIN:B000NVT0SO Hannibal Rising]], etc. It's nice to relive those old movies as they were and let the characters fade into the legendary status they deserve. By coming out with yet another movie N years later, you might get excited about it ([[ASIN:B00005JKC3 Hulk]] comes to mind, as does [[ASIN:B00005JKCH Spider-Man]]). But unlike those decently made films, Live Free Or Die Hard is a great example of keeping the classics in the past where they belong.<br /><br />I loved the [[ASIN:B000O77SQS Die Hard]] series. The first 3 movies were great! The 3rd being my favorite. But this newest (and HOPEFULLY last) installment is just unnecessary. Nobody wanted to see John McClain again, more than 10 years after his last adventure in NYC. This movie might as well have been another movie completely, taking McClain out of it and just substituting Bruce Willis' character for anyone else...it wouldn't have made a difference.<br /><br />The storyline was great, ALMOST believable. But most of the particular scenes were just completely unreal. Throughout most of the movie I was screaming at the screen \\"there's no way that would happen!\\" Particularly the action sequences with Bruce Willis barely making it out of a situation. Not to mention that he looked awful with a shaved head. Why can't men go bald gracefully??<br /><br />If you think of it as anything BUT a Die Hard movie, you might enjoy it. I just can't add this to my already mint collection.
0345495004|2.0|The opening of this book was great but about 50 or 60 pages into the story I lost interest. I think it was because I couldn't relate to the main character's conflict. Maybe it's just my lack of understanding of that time period in history. It seemed to get pretty repetitive and felt kind of melodramatic/soap operaish, and soon I stopped caring what would happen. Usually, once I stop reading a book for that reason, I don't go back to it.

031606792X|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am a 38 year old wife & mother of 2 - therefore not your typical star-struck teenager and I am stunned by all the negative reviews for this book!  I found it just as engrossing as all its predecessors and was in no way \\"disappointed\\" or \\"disgusted\\" by Bella getting pregnant and having a child or by Jacob imprinting on Renesmee (the only thing I DIDN'T like was the poor child's name!!  LOL)  In fact I thought it very poignant that that happened to Jacob and was glad that his broken heart was finally healed.    Obviously this story was not supposed to be realistic (it revolves around vampires for crying out loud) and I don't think that your average teenage girl is going to say \\"I think I'll drop out of school and get married and have a baby, oh and then become a vampire.\\"  I think the fans of this series have more sense then that.  It was just a good, old-fashioned page turner and I for one am thrilled by everything that happened and only wish it wasn't the end of the saga.  I esp. loved Bella's \\"gift\\" of shielding which explained a lot of events from the previous books.      All in all, another outstanding book from Stephanie Meyer - my 2nd favorite after \\"The Host\\".
B000LE1FAY|2.0|Bearable as the muse for the grooviest all-girl band to ever come out of LA, she's given us one dishrag album after another in years that she's become a menacing solo `artiste'.

Mon dieu!!). I surmise this could all be a lot worse (it could be \\"Heaven On Earth\\" or \\"A Woman And A Man\\" or \\"Live Your Life Be Free\\" or, worst of all, heaven-help-us, \\"Runaway Horses\\") but rather than Château Lafite, we are left with escargot on the breath.

B0010AN7Z4|5.0|There is without a doubt this movie deserved the 1960 Best Picture award,not to mention the other Oscars that contributed to this movie's success. A great cast of Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine and Fred MacMurray (hard to believe this was Fred before his My Three Sons and Disney family movies). This is a movie that has its humorous moments and serious. By the way,if I lived in New York, I would stay at this \\"apartment\\". The cost..67 dollars a month back then if you heard Jack Lemmon's dialogue in this movie. But...I am sure the price has jumped since the movie's release in 1960..we can dream can't we? Enjoy your time with Billy Wilder's \\"The Apartment...worth checking into!

0307269752|5.0|This is a fantastic mystery novel with strong character development and a delightful combination of action, romance, and of course, intrigue and mystery, to keep readers glued to its pages.  I've been busy recommending this book to my friends, and I'm confident that you will find yourself doing the same.<br /><br />I live in Sweden but unfortunately I'm not literate enough in Swedish to read this in its original language. I bought the English version at a bookstore before my flight to Miami - the flight was 9 hours, and I was done before I landed.  It was THAT good.<br /><br />As a transplant, some of the cool things about reading this book is a) understanding the cultural nuances presented in the book, and b) being able to recognize streets and other significant landmarks.  If you've ever visited Sweden or lived in Sweden, you'll know how important coffee drinking is to the culture here.  The author does not hide this detail and with the amount of coffee that the main characters drink, I still can't understand why they haven't opened up a Starbucks in Sweden.<br /><br />There are a lot of names and characters mentioned in this book so it's a little hard to keep track of who's good and who's bad sometimes, but fortunately the author helpfully included a family tree at the very beginning.  I recommend that you dog ear that page as you will be flipping back to it constantly!<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic read - it's just too bad the other books won't go on sale for a while (2009 for the second one and 2010 for the last one).  Just to be able to read the other two books is almost reason enough to learn Swedish!

B000V86OKG|5.0|When I was a kid my sister who is 9 years older than me would go to the drive in movie when her husband was in Viet Nam.  We would dring a 6-Pack of Colt 45 and watch dracula movies or whatever they had to scare us.  I knew she would love Dexter if I could get her to slow down long enough to watch.  After her divorce in 86 she has worked non stop  getting ready for retirement. Well after coming to my house to watch it everynight (she just lives 2 doors away) I convinced her she could afford ShowTime and watch some of the other dynamite shows like Californication, WEEDS,etc. It's just a great darn show.  I really think they should let me do a cameo on the show!!  Enjoy.

THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE!!!      it is rediculously stupid!! i wanted to burn the book after the first 100 pages!  the only thing that even makes it seem like a twilight saga book are the names of the characters. everything else is completely different & beyond DUMB.    as far as i see it the series ended w/ eclipse.      if ur a diehard twilight fan, i recomend going to a library to read this last book.    its a gigantic waste of time & money.        the book really is unbelievably HORRIBLE.

B00005JLCI|5.0|This is one of the greatest productions of Shakespeare I've ever seen, and I heartily recommend it to any student of Hamlet. I think seeing this breathtaking and magnificent film will greatly help high school students and college students who are approaching the play for the first time. Branagh is a genius and once again here he delivers Shakespeare's glorious lines in a way that makes them clear, and brings them to life with incalculable power. I know of no Shakespeare film that equals this film.  I dream of what Branagh will do next. We need him to give us more of the Bard. ---- There is much else that could be said about this film. Every performance is wonderful, including that of Charlton Heston, and the sensitivity with which the play is interpreted is breathtaking. The spectacle alone is worth seeing. This is one of those feasts for the eyes and ears like Amadeus or Immortal Beloved. Or the Red Shoes.  It is grand in the finest sense.  It will be enjoyed and treasured as long as film is enjoyed and treasured.

He has even shared the books with his teachers and plans to donate the finished books to his school library.
B00111YM5G|2.0|It could be an interesting story if it is about fallen angels only. However, the director and producers used the names of actual Archangels from the Bible implying that Angels from Heaven who did not fall during the first rebellion (such as Michael, Gabriel, etc.) can fall from grace and, therefore, perish; not so if we follow the Bible. Angels who did not fall during their rebellion; were allowed to a higher degree and now have the Beatific vision of God, therefore, they can not fall now (It would be like saying that people who go to Heaven, could later sin, fall from grace and perish - not so following the Bible). In this way, it's not Biblical faithful as some may think.    As for those who believe in Purgatory, contrary to what this movie says about it, the fate of those souls have already been decided; those souls are being purged or cleaned of all the venial sins they have committed or had at the our of their death before they can enter Heaven; but their fate is not \\"yet to be decided\\" (as this films says).    Bearing in mind that this is only a fictional story, I like some facts such as that Angels have the capability to appear as human in fleshy form, spend time with humans, live, eat with humans and as humans, etc; (such as the Angels who destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah). The villain in this movie is pretty good, I even liked him better than the supposed hero in this movie. Some parts of the movie became slow to me.
B000E1YVZU|1.0|I'm a sucker for musicals, I just love it when the characters sing their hearts out about their joys or troubles.     But I couldn't stand this musical. I didn't see the show, but from the movie, I'd have no desire to. All but two of the characters are entirely incredibly self-centered, but we're meant to pity them and their tragic plight? Did I miss something? Why do they think (as they sing in the opening number) that they should be exempt from paying rent like the rest of the world? Why does the heroine think its acceptable for her to cheat on her loving, supportive life-partner at their commitment ceremony? Some of the songs are catchy-ish, but the overall attitude of the characters grated through the whole thing. Yuck. AIDS awareness deserves a better musical.
B00000JAXT|4.0|You know, my original review stunk, so here's an updated version (created June 12, 2011).    Little Red Record is *significantly* better than the bands previous album.  In fact, Little Red Record doesn't even resemble that album in the slightest.  This is because the instrumental chops are actually good on Little Red Record, whereas on Matching Mole's debut the band just seemed to ramble a lot and never accomplished much besides a few disjointed and unmelodic keyboard solos and mellotron passages (and a mediocre attempt at ineffective atmosphere).    Little Red Record makes up for it entirely though, and justifies the bands existence.   There's some amazingly intense moments on here too.  First of all, \\"God Song\\" has a magnificent vocal melody and lyrically it's a creative masterpiece.      \\"Gloria Gloom\\" has an INCREDIBLY frightening 3-minute intro.  WOW is that particular part of the song extremely effective, haha.   It reminds me of a church in the middle of nowhere (like in some town down south with a population of around 150) and, during a certain time of night depending on the weather conditions, a ghost will come out of the grave and wreak havoc on the entire town.  Creative imagery!  As the 3 minutes rolls along... it just gets more unbearably ominous and intimidating.  Talk about a fantastic moment.  It immediately loses steam as soon as the mumbling vocals come in, but luckily a vocal melody appears later and darn near completely saves it, though it never again goes back to that amazing intro (though it   *tries* to near the end).    The second best song is definitely \\"Marchides\\".  An intense King Crimson-like jazz jam that takes up a good portion of its running time, and it's mostly notable for how *melodic* it is despite its relentless intensity.  The song eventually shifts into pure atmosphere, and kind of loses my attention span by this point.    \\"Nan True's Hole\\" has a heavy... um, I THINK it's a keyboard riff but I can't say for certain.  Perhaps it's guitar trickery.  Either way, the British female singer talking over said riff is a bit out of place, but the lyrics are interesting to say the least.  Some of the guitar soloing is decent too.    \\"Flora Fidgit\\" is a melodic jazzy instrumental reminiscent of Hatfield & the North.  I love it, personally.  Sure, the keyboard solo sounds severely dated, but I never cared about datedness in rock music, and you know what?  I NEVER will!  \\"Smoke Signal\\" contains mostly atmosphere without much else, but it's decent enough.  It doesn't strike me as filler perhaps because some portions of the song veer towards light jazz, and these moments are alright in my book.    I get the feeling Matching Mole was trying to make a statement with this album.  What that statement is shall remain unknown, because they never gained the success or fan support for anybody to ever find out what their intentions here were.  This band most certainly does not stand in the same league as Caravan, Soft Machine or Hatfield & the North.  Let's get that perfectly straight.  Still, as a very listenable album with its share of experiments, you can't go wrong with Little Red Record.
B0018CAAN6|2.0|I love the song 4 minutes so I was expecting the rest of the album to be similar which it wasn't.  I do really like a slower song called, \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" but besides that I wasn't crazy about the rest of the songs.
B000669GAI|4.0|What Pearl Jam did, maybe even unwittingly, was to weld the thick sludgey minor-chord sound (and general angst) of grunge to arena size rock choruses and guitar power. In doing so, they managed to quickly outshine their nearest peers ([[ASIN:B00006V9A0 Nirvana]]) commercially and ultimately become the vanguard for rock through the 90's. Along with [[ASIN:B0000C1733 Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and maybe [[ASIN:B000002G2B Soundgarden]], they shaped the sound of a decade and thrived to see their success sustained creatively.<br /><br />\\"Rearviewmirror\\" reflects (har har) that 12 years between [[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]] and [[ASIN:B00004T8RK Binaural]] in solid fashion, even if does lean heavily on the first three albums. It also offers a dozen later track to show that, even while the band's spotlight had faded somewhat, albums like [[ASIN:B000002BFZ No Code]] were better even while the band purposely was making music that antagonized fans expecting more of \\"Jeremy.\\" Treats like \\"Do The Evolution\\" and \\"Man Of The Hour\\" sound just as powerful as any of the pre-[[ASIN:B0000028UK Vs.]] material.<br /><br />And for those who argue that Eddie Vedder is a big old sourpuss, they miss out on fun stuff like the tribute to old 45's \\"Spin The Black Circle\\" or the totally unironic cover of \\"Last Kiss\\" (that actually hit the top ten in 1999). Guitarist Stone Gossard rips some particularly innovative riffs through the proceedings here, and it's worth noting that Goassard (as well as the rest of the band) usually co-wrote the band's songs. On \\"Rearviewmirror,\\" they are divided into two CD's, with an \\"Up\\" disc of rockers and the \\"Down\\" side of more pensive or acoustic material.<br /><br />It is the second disc where more of the interesting material lies for me. I've always personally felt \\"Better man\\" to be the best song Pearl Jam ever wrote, and the closer, \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" is a damn good blues number with Mike McCready hitting a terrific facsimile of Jimi Hendrix. There is plenty of meat spread between the two discs, and for the casual radio fan of Pearl Jam, this is a great sampler at a fine price.spread between the two discs, and for the casual radio fan of Pearl Jam, this is a great sampler at a fine price.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Hello Dolly has always been one of my personal favorites, despite all the negative response at the time of its original release, and what wonderful vindication, to discover that its charm lasted 700 years, to be the companion and inspiration of our beloved Wall-E! One often sees lists of best this and best that, and topping any list of Most Poignant Moments On Film must surely be the scene from Wall-E, where he watches his battered, treasured tape of Hello Dolly, and clasps his hands together - pure movie magic! I see that Hello Dolly is very high on Amazon's list of bestsellers - thank you, Wall-E for inspiring a new appreciation of Dolly, and when you win the Oscar at the next awards, Dolly will join in your celebration!

B000002UCN|1.0|Please note: the 'one-star' rating does is not intended as a reflection of the music itself. The single star is for this subpar, totally under-represented collection.    This was released originally back in 1976.  There is no good reason for it to still be in print.  Every track is available elsewhere with the exception of the 1971 charity single \\"Bangla Desh.\\"  Harrison is so far overdo for a good career-spanning Best Of that it isn't even funny. Each of the other former Beatles have excellent career retrospectives available.    More than half this collection is given over to Beatles songs. That leaves a paltry 6 solo songs, and nothing beyond 1976.  George's solo discography is rich, varied, and consistently interesting.  I can only hope that this is updated with a greatly expanded track listing (omitting Beatles songs) and remastered sound.

1593080255|5.0|There isn't much to say about Wilde's masterpiece that hasn't been said already. Filled with deliciously witty, catty wordplay and bon mots from a day where banter was highly valued, Wilde was skillfully adept at scrutinizing society and all of its flaws. The Picture of Dorian Gray is tragically ahead of its time, its philosophies on aestheticism and art are still relevant today - and will most likely always be. There were a few downsides (as I said, very few), including some dense chapters expelling the virtues, of well, non-virtue. Wilde would swiftly make up for these with delightful conversations taken straight out of the parlors of the age in which he lived. While some of them felt contrived, Dorian's slow decay into hedonism is wonderfully depicted, and the haunting last paragraph of the novel will stick with every reader. The theses the author conveys are spellbinding and dead-on, and the descriptions colored with imagery and allusions referencing Shakespeare and mythology are vivid. Wilde makes one question their own limits and passions, and engages the reader into being an active participant in life and reading.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Most reviews seem to bash this version of Persuasion but I think it's quite good and would encourage someone interested to rent it and make their own opinion.

Being an American, I had no idea what was going on in Europe in the Muslim communities.  I also didn't know hardly anything about what it was like to grow up in the countries Ali did.  This book taught me hard realities I was not aware of.      I think this is a great book and encourage everyone to read it.

B001EL6EHC|5.0|Possibly the most popular film around, 1942's Casablanca pairs two iconic actors, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, in a story of lost love and reluctant heroism.  Warner Brothers put out an excellent [[ASIN:B00009W0WM 2-disc Special Edition]] in 2003.  (That older set is going to receive new artwork on December 2nd, but it will otherwise be the same.)  This new 3-disc Ultimate Collector's Edition includes the 2003 set and adds a documentary about studio head Jack Warner, along with a bunch of memorabilia.  Here are the announced new features, the ones not included in the 2003 set.  All but the first are memorabilia.<br /><br />-- Jack L. Warner: The Last Mogul, a 1993 full-length biographical documentary (104 minutes)<br />-- 48-page photo book<br />-- 10 roughly 5x7\\" cards with color reproductions of poster art and such<br />-- 3 reproductions of archival correspondence (a memo from producer Hal Wallis changing the title to Casablanca, a memo from Wallis to studio head Jack Warner urging the casting of Bogart over George Raft, and a letter from the publicity head instructing the publicist to shift Bogart's image from tough to romantic lead)<br />-- reproduction of Victor Laszlo's letter of transit<br />-- passport holder with Casablanca logo<br />-- luggage tag with Casablanca logo<br />-- mail-in offer for 27x40\\" movie poster<br />-- all in a pretty collector's box with an intricate laser-cut Moroccan design<br /><br />The documentary, which comprises the third disc, is also available separately ([[ASIN:B000COF1QW here]]).  It was written, directed and produced by a grandson of Warner, and is said (by Variety) to be somewhat sentimental but not to overlook Warner's defects.  It isn't about Casablanca in particular.<br /><br />There are more than enough extras in the 2-disc edition for most people.  I'll list them below.  The video and sound quality of that set are very good, and they should be the same in this new edition.<br /><br />The movie is set in 1941 Casablanca, Morocco, controlled by the Nazi-collaborating Vichy French government.  Bogart plays Rick, a nightclub owner with a past he doesn't talk about and a determination not to get caught up in current events.  \\"I stick my neck out for nobody,\\" he says.  He comes into possession of two letters of transit, invaluable items to the many refugees seeking passage out of the grasp of the Nazis.  The intended recipients of the letters soon show up, resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife Ilsa (Bergman).  Ilsa, it turns out, was once Rick's lover, who broke his heart when she left him with no explanation.  Their old flame is rekindled despite themselves, and Rick must decide whether to help his rival for her love, thereby helping the war effort he has claimed no interest in, or help himself.<br /><br />No one expected this movie to be such a classic, and even though it won three major Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it only gained its place as a classic gradually over the years.  Undoubtedly the two stars are a big part of the reason it grew on us.  Bogart is perfect as a cynic who has more heart than he lets on.  Just by being there, Bergman instantly conveys every reason we need to understand Rick's broken heart and feel the force of his dilemma, and she convincingly portrays her own conflict between two loves.  Somehow the movie also gets other things just so.  Several of the supporting actors manage to be morally corrupt and still likable; others are just likable.  The writing, a fair amount of it done quickly, by committee, with no thought of it being great writing, has panache, and hits on several turns of phrase that just work.  All of these things lift up the story of love, higher duty, and the triumph of good over evil, and over cynicism.<br /><br />Here's the list of the features included from the 2003 Special Edition:<br /><br />-- Introduction by Bogart's wife and frequent co-star Lauren Bacall (2 minutes)<br />-- Audio commentaries<br />. . . . . by Roger Ebert<br />. . . . . by film historian/author Rudy Behlmer<br />-- Documentaries and featurette<br />. . . . .

Bogart plays Rick, a nightclub owner with a past he doesn't talk about and a determination not to get caught up in current events.  \\"I stick my neck out for nobody,\\" he says.  He comes into possession of two letters of transit, invaluable items to the many refugees seeking passage out of the grasp of the Nazis.  The intended recipients of the letters soon show up, resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife Ilsa (Bergman).  Ilsa, it turns out, was once Rick's lover, who broke his heart when she left him with no explanation.  Their old flame is rekindled despite themselves, and Rick must decide whether to help his rival for her love, thereby helping the war effort he has claimed no interest in, or help himself.<br /><br />No one expected this movie to be such a classic, and even though it won three major Academy Awards, including Best Picture, it only gained its place as a classic gradually over the years.  Undoubtedly the two stars are a big part of the reason it grew on us.  Bogart is perfect as a cynic who has more heart than he lets on.  Just by being there, Bergman instantly conveys every reason we need to understand Rick's broken heart and feel the force of his dilemma, and she convincingly portrays her own conflict between two loves.  Somehow the movie also gets other things just so.  Several of the supporting actors manage to be morally corrupt and still likable; others are just likable.  The writing, a fair amount of it done quickly, by committee, with no thought of it being great writing, has panache, and hits on several turns of phrase that just work.  Even the music works beyond what was expected, making \\"As Time Goes By\\" unforgettable.

B000002LA2|5.0|There are so many customer reviews reviewing this CD but none of them list the musicians. I think knowing the musicians BEFORE buying the CD gives the buyer more information that he/she would would like to know. So the musicians are for this CD, Eric Clapton with on #1 Gary Brooker (keys, vocals); Rich Cotile (synth); Laurence Cotile (bass); Henry Spinnetti (drums); all other tracks, Greg Phillinganes (keys, vocals); Nathan East (bass); Phil Collins (drums, vocals, percussion); Michael Brecker, Jon Faddis, Randy Brecker, Dave Bargerone (horns); Katie Kissoon, Tessa Niles, Magic Moreno, Tina Turner (vocals); Rich Feldman (keys). Enjoy this disc!
B00000AFFI|3.0|I can't say this is one my favorite PJ discs, but seriously, can she do poor work? Something with the overused beats and hints of melodic struggling make half of ITD sound a little desperate to be edgy. Of course, in the end, this reliable artist pulls through with her  vocal intuitions.

B000001ESF|3.0|3 1/2    A very decently ambitious classic progressive rock album in my opinion, but largely overrated as one of the flagpoints in the genre. Probably unnecessarily elevated for it's conceptual arch and epic introduction suite, 2112 is still a worthwhile investment for those dabbling in prog via classic rock. The emphasis however does not lie in complex melodic manipulations and challenging time signatures but in fluid, unpretentious rock and roll with a slightly nerdier angle, undoubtedly \\"enhanced\\" with these acquired high pitched, in tune shrieks.
B00005JPY0|1.0|I had really been looking forwards to this film, while I enjoyed Batman Begins, I found that there were problems with it, which I had  thought would be remedied with this film. Coupled with the hype sorounding The Dark Knight I thought that I would be in for a treat.<br /><br />Instead I was tremendously disappointed.<br /><br />The Dark Knight  is more like a glorified episode of `The Sheild' or `The Wire', in which a cops and lawyers try to apprehend a psychopath. The movie is more about Gordon, Dent and The Joker than it is about Batman. In fact Batman is hardly in the film at all, and when he is featured there is no depth to his appearance or performance.  In fact if Batman had been taken out of it, or his part replaced with a maverick cop or private eye the film would have not been changed. Batman being in the film had no consequence to the film.  In retrospect the film really should have been called `The Joker' because the film  is more about him than anyone else.<br /><br />Here are some of the problems I had with the film.<br /><br />*In Batman Begins, Bruce said that he traveled the world to understand the criminal mind. Are we supposed to believe that he never came across a psychopath during his travels? I also guess that in the Nolan Batverse we are to believe that Stalin and Hitler and other such monsters never existed. Which is why it explains his complete surprise that someone like the Joker could exist, and his inability to get a handle him.<br /><br />* Batman is supposed to be well versed in the martial arts which above all  else instills discipline and focus. Yet he allows the Joker to needlessly provoke him into loosing his temper, wasting precious time while his  two friends are in mortal danger.<br /><br />* Batman has been on the job at most a year, yet he is able to order the Gotham City Police Department to do his bidding. I almost choked when I saw him lecture a cop about not contaminating the crime scene.<br /><br />*The Jokers' success in the film is contingent on most of the characters behaving stupidly and having no common sense.<br /><br />* In Batman Begins, Bruce was committed to being Batman, now in the TDK he wants to throw in the towel and quit at the first sign of trouble.  I would have thought that Batman would have a stronger spine.<br /><br />* Bruce deciding that he can give up being Batman because he now has Dent to take his place. How can that be the case when he and Dent do two completely different jobs? Batman is a vigilante who helps to apprehend criminals. Dent is a prosecutor who tries criminals, he does nothing to apprehend criminals he has to rely on the cops to do that.<br /><br />* Bruce saying that Dent is his successor despite the fact that Dent already had a bad reputation to begin with. Wasn't Batman supposed to have done research?<br /><br />* Dent's speech at dinner about Batman wanting to give up being Batman someday. How is Dent supposed to have come by this information?<br /><br />* Dent's sudden transformation to Two Face, because of the death of his girlfriend.<br /><br />*If the Joker is hell bent on confusion and destruction and human misery, why is he taking the time to explain to Dent that he had nothing to do with the death of his girlfriend?<br /><br />* The whole scene with the ferry. The notion of a group willing to sacrifice themselves until death for another group of people is unrealistic. Self-preservation is the number one rule of all human beings. Also if people are as self-sacrificing and nice as Nolan wants to suggest in that scene. Then what do they need Batman for?<br /><br />*Two Face whining about the what's fair, yet trying to justify trying to kill Gordon's family.<br /><br />* The notion that Batman is setting himself up as a sacrificial lamb at the end of the film because 'that's what the people' need is a lame attempt to draw an equation between Batman and Jesus Christ. It was extremely tacky and contrived. Nowhere is it written in any of theBatman books that Batman's  intent is to take the punishment for the people.<br /><br />*The Hong Kong scene was stupid and pointless, as was the useless car chase.<br /><br />And of course the self-important, pseudo intellectual verbiage that piled out of every characters mouth, No one spoke in this film. They just gave grandiose speeches. I just found it hard to take seriously<br /><br />This is one of the worst films I have ever seen in my entire life.  Clearly Nolan has no understanding or respect for Batman.id and pointless, as was the useless car chase.      And of course the self-important, pseudo intellectual verbiage that piled out of every characters mouth, No one spoke in this film. They just gave grandiose speeches.

031606792X|4.0|I think it must be the hardest thing to write a book that becomes an unexpected phenomenon. Suddenly all eyes are on you, the author, to repeat the small miracle of language and creativity and craft that let you speak to so many in such different ways. And repeating that sort of magic is no easy task.<br /><br />'Twilight' remains my favorite book of the series, though 'New Moon' and 'Eclipse' both had a lot of good going for them as well. 'Breaking Dawn,' the last installment, ends the series well even though it has some flaws. Endings are never easy, and ending a story like this is especially hard in some ways. 'Eclipse' left so many open questions about what would happen to Bella and her relationships with Edward and Jacob, her father, her mother, how the werewolves would react, what would happen with the Volturi...so many loose ends to tie up.<br /><br />'Breaking Dawn' does well in this regard. Though some plot developments are a little convenient, everything is resolved in the end, and mostly satisfactorily.  I was pleased when the ending took a different turn than I expected it to take, though one that made sense and fit with everything leading up to it. Many of the characters go through big changes in 'Breaking Dawn,' but they're changes that make sense in context of the story. When I closed the book I was happy overall.<br /><br />However, it's not as perfect a book as 'Twilight' was. Stephenie Meyer is a really good writer, but at over 700 pages 'Breaking Dawn' is showing the bloat of a writer who has a lot to say but doesn't know quite how to say it. Like the middle Harry Potter books (particularly books 4 and 5), there are whole sections of 'Breaking Dawn' that could be condensed by removing repetitive dialogue or description, or in a couple case removed altogether, without making the story suffer. Meyer was clearly having fun exploring some new territory (and who can blame her, she waited through three whole books to get here!), but for the reader some of it gets old pretty quick.<br /><br />But overall, 'Breaking Dawn' is a good book and a solid conclusion to a great series. The 'Twilight' series is hands-down one of the most original and heartfelt takes on vampire stories in quite a while, and Meyer did a fine job finishing the story off in a satisfying way.ick.

B00003CXFV|4.0|... that the first reason why Americans did elect Bush was sheer stupidity. The second was gunslingers and oil-moguls needed some puppet to get them freeway in BS-perpetrating. I can now see there is a third one (not altogether unworthy) : to help huge corporations benefiting from those who are voting so they can get the worse (although there is a lot of competition) crapmongers messing with their lives. But, since U.S. (I wouldn't say America since US citizens managed to wipe the America's citizens out in a way that would make Hitler look like a choirboy) seems to pride itself as the world's rule, and Bush has given more than enough proof that perjury is the best way (if he could get a third mandate, the MacDo's/crap's addicts (sorry for the redundancy) would have given him.     I must say I'm always surprised when anyone get some compensation, but I would be more surprised if REAL compensations were awarded to those who deserve some : how about those people who would have been better if the Bush Family had been put out of business at Nuremberg???????

1577314808|5.0|Any one who reads this book will get something useful from it. Being present is not a new idea. But some times we do not realize we are not present. It is a good way to be in touch with life to be in the now.  I did not underline in the book but might have and it would be easier to be specific. It is best to read a book and get what you need with out thinking you have to look for it in a book. Be open minded and the book is valuable.  The Power of Now is a worth while book to read.
1401207510|1.0|I guess this edition just shows to you a tip of the iceberg of the attitude Alan Moore had to deal with under DC publishing. DC tries to cash in on Moore's reputation.

B000RPTQ1C|3.0|I like this album. I think compared to the last album, X and Y, this one has much more of Coldplay's original sound to it. Cos I think Coldplay is all about original sound. That's what makes them different than other Brit rock bands. But having said that, this album, nor any of Coldplay's albums after Parachutes, could never beat their very first album, Parachutes itself. I was kinda hoping that Coldplay would go back to something much more like Parachutes. That one was a masterpiece. But I still like Viva La Vida.     And if I would say whether or not it values my money spent, yes, it does.    My favorite song in the album? They're all my favorites, which is a good thing, cos I don't like it when only certain songs are good.
0321525655|5.0|I LOVE this book!  It is not only a wonderful and simply laid out way of challenging old assumptions about Power Point presentations and the way we construct them, but it also contains some great philosophy to inspire originality.  The book is cleanly laid out, and has application to areas other than just presentations; it makes you think more about the way you present generally and sell your ideas.    Reynolds is generous in his acknowledgement of other writers and people who have inspired him - I have bought most of the other books he refers to and found them extremely useful.    The chapters are presented in way that makes your recollection of them easier, and putting them in the Zen context certainly aids with awareness.    I really do recommend this book to others, and it's worth also taking a look at the related blog for ongoing examples of effective presentations.

1400079276|5.0|Upon first delving into \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" by Haruki Murakami, I found myself dreading another coming of age story.  However, it proved to be so much more than this in a variety of ways.  Of course, there is still the classic runaway story present, but how many coming of age tales feature talking crows and cats, in addition to raining leeches?  Despite my preconceived notions, \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" opened up an entirely new realm of thinking for me, which is what I appreciate most in a text.                  I truly loved the alternating storylines of Kafka and Nakata with each chapter.  Not only were the two incredibly interesting on their own, but I also craved to learn how they would intersect and finally converge.  I feel that above all else, such suspense truly kept me engaged and connected at all times, even during rants about World War II.                  Moreover, it seems that the overall strangeness of the text cannot be ignored when attempting to uncover what draws the reader in to the point of entranced connection.  The bizarre Oedipal complex prophecy, the children passing out during a break from school, Johnny Walker, and the sexual dreams transformed the story into something much larger, something much more powerful.  These details removed any suspicions that this was another attempt at a Huckleberry Finn, and introduced the text as its own entity.  Additionally, I feel that each of these details, in spite of how strange they may or may not be, allowed the story to transcend to an utterly spiritual level in my mind.  They blended the line between reality and imagination, so much so that I found myself barely questioning the dialogue of a cat.  Also, the ethereal and poetic writing maintained this blend and instilled a dream-like quality to the text.  I believe that this really transformed the story, for with each line, the fantasy becomes a bit more real and the reader is no longer distracted by an over analysis of nightly visits from Miss Saeki's fifteen-year-old spirit with some sort of physics talk.                 I find it incredibly fascinating that time has such a large role in the end, because throughout the majority of the story, it has no significance at all.  As Hoshimo must kill the stone's nemesis when it is dark, he therefore must battle with time by napping during the day.  Similarly, Kafka must compete with time, for if he doesn't, he risks the chance of the entrance closing before he has escaped.  Perhaps the fact that time actually possesses significance in the last few chapters is no coincidence at all, but instead, illustrates that normality has been restored.  With the entrance now closed and Kafka's prophecy behind him in the past, it seems that he can officially move forward.  He no longer has to cope with the blend of the past, present and future, but can now embrace the present in the manner he decides is proper.  Time is ultimately set into place with the image of Kafka's watch beginning to function again, and it paves the way for the clear outlook on life that Kafka seems to have in the end.                   The Komura Memorial Library was an idyllic Eden for me, and Oshima's cabin in the woods reintroduced Thoreau-inspired concepts.  Oshima was a mentor for me, a teacher above all else, and I craved eel after almost every reading.  It was exceedingly easy for me to immerse myself in the world of text, reading close to 100 pages each day.  And as I imagined myself submerged in the serenity of the woods, the fresh and detailed writing engaged all of my senses and made me feel that, as a reader, I really was a part of the story.  I closed the book with a feeling of completeness, but more importantly, one that I could understand.  And I truly feel that ultimately, that is what every great book aims to instill in its reader.
1400064627|4.0|'Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe' is the charming story of two women in 1986, one of whom, old and oracular, soothes the angst of the other, middle-aged and depressed, by telling her wonderful stories of her youth in a railway podunk. I'm sure you know all that already. I heartily recommend this novel: it's witty yet meaningful, the characters are sympathetic and easy to get attached to, and the writing is spot-on. There are quite a few typos and errors in my text; perhaps they've been rectified in further editions. Let these not distract, however, from the fact that FGTATWSC is perfect for a swift and entertaining, yet meaningful read. Fannie Flagg, I salute you!

I was expecting to see Mulder and Scully from the X-Files running on the other side of the temple at the end.  Seems to me that Lucas could have done much better with the script after all this time.  Harrison Ford was great as usual and the supporting cast did a decent job.  If you're an Indiana Jones fan you will like this but it will leave you a little dissapointed in the end, just a little.

B001B71NOI|3.0|there was no premade expectations for this album because it came out so quick after the single discipline was released. it was just there for us to analyze and quite frankly its the most disappointing album nin has released. nothing stands out musically nor lyrically. reznor strums the same emotional chords he has in previous albums that it sounds like some of these could of been filler for another album, insincere even. the songs were decent enough individually, perhaps it could of been innovative and catchy if some other band released them - discipline could of been from a new wave influenced band and and letting you could of been thrown to a mainstream hard rock band but there are higher expectations for nine inch nails. together on an album, there's nothing that ties the tracks together, they seem to be piled on- first half more energetic and edgier songs and the rest are the softer songs to resolve the album. its understood trent is maturing and trying to covering new ground so i give this album the benefit of the doubt whether its my own misunderstanding of it. but i don't believe i'll ever understand it as much as the others.
B000P0J0AG|4.0|Heat is a rare masterpiece. Mann tells his stories in such a unique and captivating manner. Heat is a movie with a somewhat implausible storyline, that is told with incredible realism. Every event in this movie is shown with such detail and with such a realistic, \\"in your face\\" feel, that every one of it's 3 hrs is intriguing. Maybe this is just one of those movies that only select few are going to enjoy, but I think it's incredible, with excellent performances by Pacino, de Niro, and a young Portman. (alright, her performance isn't anything special, but she is.) Each actor shows us a unique and believable individual, which is what should happen. At the very least, the shootout in L.A. is one of the best of it's kind in any movie, at least that I've seen. These are my thoughts on one of the best movies ever made.
B0018M6J90|4.0|The lead-in cinematic and musical elements for this delightfully entertaining, fast paced, little bit of nostalgia film prepares the viewer for the story as well as any 'overture' could. The setting is London in the 1930s, the day of the first blitzkrieg, and the tone of the imagery is that quiet depression  and angst that tainted the world during that time.  We meet our main character Miss Guinevere Pettigrew, a dowdy, middle-aged failed governess as she wanders through the streets and soup kitchens - all to the tune of 'Brother, can you spare a dime'.  This 'day in a life' abruptly changes when Miss Pettigrew, still saddened by the loss of her beloved in WW I and struggling to be moral as the daughter of a clergyman in a world gone to tatters.  How she finds one day of joy - and in the process changes the lives of those she encounters - is the line of the story, a screenplay by David Magee  and Simon Beaufoy  based on the novel of the same name by Winifred Watson  and directed with a fine sense of timing and comedy cum pathos by Bharat Nalluri.<br /><br />Quite by a fluke Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) absconds the name of a potential client from her caustic job finder and rings the bell of one Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams), a beautiful young American manipulator of men living in one boyfriend's luxurious flat while entertaining others who may help her reach her dream of being a star on the musical stage. Delysia believes Miss Pettigrew to be a social secretary and immediately involves her in the game of her life of flirtation and illusion.  Miss Pettigrew, at first shocked by the 'social setting', soon adapts and indeed supports Delysia's efforts of meandering through gentleman callers, and as Delysia finds Miss Pettigrew indispensible she dresses her well and introduces her to a life Miss Pettigrew finds quite foreign but equally fascinating.  In rapid fire sequence, at times overlapping like a Keystone Cops movie, we meet Delysia's paramours (played with devilish glee by Tom Payne, Mark Strong, and Lee Pace) as well as high society dames (Shirley Henderson) and the one man who seems above it all - Ciar&aacute;n Hinds.  All of this wild dash through the superficial society affairs is played against the all but ignore threat of the impending WW II and it all happens in one day.  But at the end of that day the bond between Miss Pettigrew and Delysia is genuinely sealed and for a moment at least it seems Miss Pettigrew's previously dour existence has changed.<br /><br />A fine cast, an intelligent director, a creative cinematographer John de Borman, and a well informed musical director Paul Englishby make this bit of froth into a confection that contains some social commentary ingredients.  The costumes and sets are splendid and provide a view of London before the devastation of the war that is rich in nostalgia.  Not a great movie, but a delightful romp that allows McDormand and Adams the opportunity to demonstrate their considerable comedy gifts.

0743486285|5.0|This is a great read! I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine that really likes the Crue. After reading a couple of pages, I realized that I needed to buy it for myself as well. I'm glad I did.    First off, I want to say that I am NOT a big fan of Motley Crue's music. That did not stop me from enjoying the hell out of this book. Nikki really pulled me in and captured my imagination the entire way through.     I would highly recommend this for anyone that is into sex, drugs and/or rock and roll.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|Batman 1989 Directed by Tim Burton starring Jack Nicholson as The Joker, Micheal Keaton as Batman/Bruce Wayne Kim Bassinger as Vicky Vale, Billy Dee Willams as Harvey Dent, Pat Hingle as Gordon Jack Palance as Grissom is a timeless classic your story is about Gotham City a crime ridden city the man behind all this is Carl Grissom the leader of the mob. When he learns that his right hand man Jack Naiper is f&uuml;ç***g  his girlfriend he sets Jack up. Jack ends up falling into a vat of chemicals but he lives & it turns his hair green his skin white & it makes him even more psycho 1st he kills Grissom & gets control of the mob then eventually we learn that he has poised beauty goods hairspray make up ect ect it is killing people Bruce later learns that Joker when he was Jack Naiper killed his parents. Also Bruce is dating Vicky Vale & The Joker wants her too so of course he has to save her a couple of times. I think the plot with Nicholson's Joker was more like the Joker.

B00188KD1Y|4.0|I hate just about every Paul W.S. Anderson film, but he actually pulled this one off. The action scenes are intense, helped by the use of practical effects, rather than CGI overkill. Just wait until you see the tanker truck getting flipped in slow motion. Almost as cool as the semi truck flip in The Dark Knight. Jason Statham is the action star of this decade. The man has muscles everywhere and does the most with his limited acting range. Ian McShane of HBO's Deadwood is given some good lines and is one of the more memorable characters in the movie. I hope he gets more big screen parts in the future. Joan Allen turns in performance I could have never pictured her doing before today, and it worked.<br /><br />Death race will likely give you a headache with it's shaky camera movements and some of the dialogue could have used some work, but I had a great time. If your of the male gender, the cars, guns, explosions and babes will keep you entertained.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars

B001DDBCUA|5.0|I must say, the first person who wrote a review for this is so snobby! Take the movie for what it is! It brought closure to the series.  And as for the designers and \\"haute couture\\", seriously, how much money can a writer make anyway!! It is realistic and it brought emotions running back again.  I LOVED the series as well and I think that people shouldn't take movies so seriously.  Just have fun and take it!
B000A59PMO|5.0|As good a season of TV as you will EVER see, VMS1 is note perfect in every department. I bought the show purely on the back of rabid forum recommendation and put off watching it for ages because I was afraid it would be patronising teen garbage but I couldn\\"t have been more wrong. The upside was I amassed all 3 seasons and watched them all back to back and while all 3 are fantastic, season 1 is just extraordinarily good. It is a travesty the show was cancelled after 3 seasons - Les Moonves, you are NOT my favourite person despite your humorous appearances on \\"The Late Show\\"! Cancel that crap, CSI Miami and put Veronica Mars back on air!

If you want this publication FOR FREE, kindleclassics.org is a good place to get it.  The formating is very easy to read (unlike this particular copy, as it doesn't have any quotation marks at all). The only disadvantage with using kindleclassics.org is you have to connect your kindle to your computer in order to get them on your kindle, but it's a very easy plug and play operation.

B0013FSVES|5.0|What Muti does in the party scene in the 1st act is unbelievable. His fast tempos fits extremely well. Scotto's voice is, of course, quite different from Votto's recording. I am very found of Scotto's freshness on that recording. She went through this highly difficult score with an apparent easiness that is admirable. On this recording, she is more dense (her tone reminds me Cortubas or maybe it is vice-versa). Nevertheless, it is a wonderful accomplishment. Kraus sounds very similar as his Duke in the Rigoletto recording with Beverly Sills. Incredible fresh voice for his age. Bruson is okay. That duet on the second act is so beautiful that it is very hard to mess up. Votto was Muti's mentor but in this case the apprentice surpassed the master in every single way. If we had Scotto and Bastianini from the Votto recording and Kraus and Muti from this recording, it would be a dream Traviata. Since we don't have that, this is the Traviata that I most listen to, due in great part to Muti.
1577314808|4.0|A book like this(which would also include his subsequent \\"A New Earth)can be really effective in giving one \\"a shot in the arm\\", the realization that there is only the NOW to be experienced.  As such even thoughts, concerns and preoccupations with the past(via memories)or the future(via anticipation, expectation)still only occur in the NOW.    The above notwithstanding, an individual really intent on awakening from the \\"dream\\" of illusion could only get so far with the message(such as the thought that \\"I need to live in the NOW\\") and would require a legitimate Guru for the proper spiritual guidance.

0930289234|5.0|I first heard of Watchmen when I saw a trailer for its movie. Liking the trailer very much, I bought a copy of the graphic novel to see what it was about. What I expected was a light fun read full of pointless action like most other comics.<br />I couldn't have been farther from the truth.<br />What I read instead was a captivating novel with wonderfully developed characters and an intriguing plot with romance, action, and deep questions involving morality and the value of a human life.<br />Set in 1985 in an alternate history of the US, Watchmen follows the stories of masked vigilantes as they try to unveil a plot to kill them off.<br />Regardless of whether you are an avid reader or don't enjoy reading at all, Watchmen is sure to be a very enjoyable read.
0064410935|5.0|I have read this classic to my kids (and to myself, decades ago), and two of my daughters have read it too.<br /><br />My 10-year old says that she find it believeable, even with the talking animals.  By that, I think that she appreciates the humanization of the animal characters.  This is a story, tenderly told, about life and death, friendship, selfishness and generosity, and generally what it means to live among others.  Read it with your kids.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I won't rehash what all of the positive reviews have said. My five star rating speaks for itself.     As for the negative reviews about this movie, I can't help but make the observation that those individuals apparently don't understand or appreciate the genre of fantasy drama. There are a few somewhat implausible elements to the story, but they're done artistically enough that instead of detracting from the film, they enhance the emotion of it.

Add one orphaned niece and a free-spirited, opera-loving sous chef and suddenly her life changes drastically.  This is a pleasant movie--light and entertaining--but nothing you can't predict shortly after these two characters are introduced.  The high points are the kitchen scenes and Abigail Breslin playing the part of the niece like the old soul that she is.

031606792X|5.0|I first learned about the Twilight series when I saw the trailer for the movie \\"Twilight\\" at the beginning of this year and immediately had to get my hands on the book. In forty-eight hours, I read \\"Twilight\\" and by the end of the week, I'd finished the first three books. I pre-ordered my copy of \\"Breaking Dawn\\" and counted-down the days.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Not one bit.<br /><br />I find it hard to believe that there are so many people disgusted or upset by this book and there are so many gripes, mainly more about the actual events in the book than bad writing.<br /><br />((SPOILERS AHEAD))<br /><br />\\"Bella isn't supposed to have a baby!\\"<br /><br />\\"Vampires can't get someone pregnant!\\"<br /><br />\\"Why is Jacob imprinting on a child? That's disgusting!\\"<br /><br />News flash; Vampires don't really exist. Neither do werewolves. And love at first sight isn't real either, not in the same sense that it is in the \\"Twilight\\" series.<br /><br />Lighten up, people! It's FICTION! It's there to keep us on the edge of our seat, to make us laugh, to make us cry, and keep up distracted from the problems of the real world. In short, it's entertainment.<br /><br />So before you go writing an angry letter to Stephenie Meyer, stop. And before you burn or return your copy of \\"Breaking Dawn\\", try donating it to your local library so that people in the world who'd actually like to enjoy the book have an opportunity to.<br /><br />It'll be good for your karma and may keep you from acting like a schmuck at the end of the day.

031606792X|3.0|So I picked up Twilight 2 weeks ago and was enthralled. I read it in 2 days and soon after read New Moon and Eclipse. As I started reading Breaking Dawn a few days ago, I felt sad because I knew the saga would end and that I would not be able to continue reading about these characters' lives.   Now that I am finished with Breaking Dawn, I am stunned. I did not expect to be glad the book was over. I did not enjoy the nice little package created in this book. Sure Bella has gotten away from evil in the previous books...(I like to think it is because characters like James, Laurent and Victoria took their time while trying to kill her leaving room for her hero to save the day)...The beginning of Breaking Dawn had me hooked. I was eager to read about Edward and Bella's continuing romance. I think I enjoyed Bella as a human more because she was so vulnerable and innocent.  I saw a glimmer of hope when on the honeymoon she thought about going to Dartmoth for a little while and being human.  It seemed like the story would go in a good direction with struggles and choices to make.  When it occurred to be that Bella had gotten pregnant...the book suddenly became confusing and less interesting. (Has Meyer explained how a vampire without blood, or dare I say, bodily fluids, can impregnante a woman?)At that point, I went from a believer to a confused and disgruntled reader. As the book continued, I was excited and intrigued by her transformation into a newborn, but soon again, she lost me with Bella's heightened abilities. She was THAT naturally good at being a vampire????? I know, I know she was born to be in this life.     The whole showdown at the end did not have me on the edge of my seat. First of all, there are too many names and characters to deal with. And since the readers have no connection to these characters, it is hard to stay truly interested. I know Meyer tried to lead us to believe that Renesmee would be cared for my Jacob and that no one would survive, but personally, I saw through that hole. Like I didn't see Alice coming back??? :)     Am I happy these characters are together, yes.   I just wish there was a little more vulnerability in this book and not so much \\"perfection\\" with the characters.     5 stars for Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse.....   3 stars for Breaking Dawn.  It was just mediocre and average.    What would have been cool, would have been is Meyer had the book end with an uncertain battle and Jaoob running off with Renesmee. There could have been a 5th book where the family picked up the pieces and ended with a happy reunion between Edward Bella and Renesmee in the jungles of South America.      I feel badly...because I do not hate this book, I just wish it was more of what the first 3 were. They were magical.    Either way, the series is great and I look fwd to the films.
B0010ZR160|4.0|\\"Gone Baby Gone\\" heralds director Ben Affleck as an artistic prescence to be reckoned with.  The film teems with a highly individualistic style informed by Affleck's upbringing in working class Boston.  You can taste it in the art direction and the authentic dialogue espoused by the film's denizens.  The film also contains one jawdropping performance by Amy Ryan as the crack-addicted mother of a missing child.  That you can engender any sympathy for this apathetic character is a credit to Ryan as an actress.  Oscar got it wrong on this one.  I would be a little more enthused by the film if not for a slightly lackluster script, cowritten, ironically by Affleck.  It's not that the plot is convoluted but a little too labyrinthian for my liking.  Another thing that is blatantly obvious is the casting of Morgan Freeman in a role originally intended for a white actor.  You can never quibble about employing an actor of the high calibre of Freeman but wouldn't it have made more sense to give his character a black wife?  Nonetheless, an interesting film that's well worth your while.

B000R8YC1I|4.0|They don't make family films like they used to. Remember \\"Return to Oz\\" and \\"The Neverending Story\\"? Well, they were brilliant compared to the family films of today. This film, \\"The Dark Crystal\\", is also brilliant in its own right. There are no human characters, the setting are definitely otherworldly, and the villains are definitely not kid-friendly. What I like most about this film is the way the characters are created (Jim Henson did a find job with the Tolkienesque muppets). What I like least about this film is that, like other reviewers have mentioned, the film tends to drag in some parts (most notably the first twenty minutes). But that flaw aside, this film along with many other dark family films ranks somewhere near the top of my list.<br /><br />B+
B00080ZG10|1.0|Its been a while so thought I would complain about the hype of this movie. As I recall it was quite touted by hollywood... What a joke... I think if anything Orson Wells was rolling over in his grave... This was a cheap (or rather expensive waste) attempt at Citizen Kane... From beginning to end a carbon copy with a different tycoon... Except Leo does not suit the character... Don't bother unless you are very bored like I was this afternoon....
B001B71NOI|5.0|From the times I have already to listen to it, I think this is one of their better works
B0018YIW4S|5.0|After 5 stellar studio albums, in 1979 UFO (Phil Moog, Michael Schenker, Andy Parker, Pete Way, Paul Raymond) released the live record Strangers In The Night. It went on to become highly acclaimed and a favorite among many musicians. However still criminally underlooked. What makes this different from the studio albums? UFO seemingly, after hearing the bonus live cuts on their new 2008 remastered editions come off as a cool live band but their performances are raw and in a way lack spark. This album however, track for track, second for second captures a spirit of rock and roll rarely heard on a live release. Re-relesed in 1999 with two bonus cuts and an altered track listing that more accuratly fit UFO's set list of the time, the sound is superb as is the 2008 as well. Apparenly the inbetween song banter and chat from Phil Moog and Pete Way was not on the original record however I think it adds a better live feel. With that in mind there are also no drop out or fades which is the case with about 98% of every live album you'll likely to hear. The show is one long concert with the exception of the two bonus cuts Hot N Ready and Cherry which were recorded at two seperate venues and tacked on at the beginning. Normally this wouldnt be very acceptable but the record isnt disrupted at all by it and if historical significance prevails that UFO did open their 78/79 tour with these tracks then let it be so here. As for the songs...guitarist Michael Schenker has complained there could've been a better song list. And while it's very very hard to see anything wrong with this albums tracklisting which is just about the best of UFO you can get. True there were some lost nuggets on those early albums but the major highlights will always be picked when it comes to this sort of thing. As for the performances themselves, UFO are tight as ever, possibly the tighest live on record band I've ever, very crisp, clean but very heavy, translating that vicious guitar sound from studio to stage without problem. The tracklisting itself fits quite nicely together as after you hear this album it'll be impossible to think of Natural Thing without Out In The Street as a segueway. Or This Kids following the in your face strut of Mother Mary. All the selected tracks take on a life of their own as they never have before but one makes special note of this on the closing epic ballad from the Lights Out album - Love To Love. The song, while surely effective in studio truely shows what a masterpiece it is in a live setting. Doctor Doctor, while a force of a song on the debut, also takes a much larger shape here in this setting to become a fist pumping hard rock anthem for the ages. Rock Bottom, once more...stretched out to almost 10 minutes here becomes a true guitar show case for Schenker and demonstrates just how much style he really had with the Flying V. With the good times roll party boogie of Too Hot To Handle wraps things up along with the encore Shoot Shoot, it ends up being the perfect show. Schenker quit the group after the album was recorded thus preventing any overdubbing, which unlike almost any other live album, this is how it was and there are zero mistakes, adding to the authenticity of how great this player was. Though it was said that Mother Mary and This Kids were studio tracks with crowd sounds, its impossible to tell. In the end, it goes without saying this belongs right up there with Thin Lizzy's Live And Dangerous, Kiss Alive!, Seger's Live Bullet, Deep Purple's Made In Japan, Cheap Trick's At Budokan and Nugent's Double Live Gonzo as the crowning live albums of all time and UFO's star document of talent and musical chops. Essentially this a record no rock fan should be without.

6305752672|3.0|At this time, Eric Bischoff had been removed from power in WCW & the company was a complete mess infront & behind the camera so WCW hired former WWE writers Vince Russo & Ed Ferrah to take over WCW.  So this PPV happened within their first week there so this PPV heavily reflected the 1995 edition where it was more about focusing on setting up future feuds & storylines throughout the night.<br /><br />WCW Crusierweight Champion Disco Infernio vs. Lash Laroux - This was a nice opening match match here between both men with a few high spots here & there.  Disco really improved his wrestling skills around this time.<br /><br />Falls Count Anywhere Street Fight for WCW Tag Team Titles: Harlem Heat vs. First Family (Brian Knobbs & Hugh Morris) vs. Filthy Animals (Konnan & Kidman) - On the previous Nitro, the Filthy Animals combination of Mysterio & Konnan won the WCW Tag Team Titles from Harlem Heat but Mysterio was injured during the match so the tag titles were stripped & held up in this match.  This was just an all out brawl that used weapons in the ring, brawling through the stage setup, and backstage where even a mummy (you read that right) was used as a weapon.  Fun match to watch as Harlem Heat regained the belts again.<br /><br />Perry Saturn vs. Eddie Guerrero - The future \\"radicalz\\" engaged in a solid encounter here but this just turned out to be a background for Ric Flair to appear & get his revenge on a member of the Filthy Animals for them stealing Flair's rolex & other property earlier in the week.<br /><br />Brad Armstong vs. Berlyn - For those who don't remember, Berlyn was Alex Wright under a new gimmick but Brad ended up winning this one in short order.  DUD!<br /><br />WCW Television Champion Chris Benoit vs. Rick Steiner - This was a real technical match here between both men that showcased some good storytelling but just like the Eddie Guerrero match, this match was just a backdrop for all the problems surround Benoit & Malenko's assocation with fellow Revolution members Shane Douglas & Perry Saturn as Malenko turned on Benoit to side with Douglas & Saturn and also helped Steiner regain the championship.<br /><br />Bret Hart vs. Total Package - Again for those who don't remember, the Total Package was the refreshed gimmick of Lex Luger.  This was actually one of Luger's best wrestling matches in recent years here as him & Bret worked a nice match surrounding Bret's leg that led to Luger getting the submission victory in the end.<br /><br />WCW Champion Sting vs. Hulk Hogan - A month earlier, WCW decided to turn Sting heel against Hogan on his way to winning the WCW Championship.  However, this rematch never happened as Hogan came out in his street clothes & just layed down for Sting to pin him & walk out.  Weather this was suppost to be part of an angle (like what happened less than a year later at Bash At The Beach) & if this was real life, the entire truth regarding that story still remains a mystery as Russo was famous for trying to do \\"the rest is fake but this is real\\" angles during this time in WCW.<br /><br />WCW United States Champion Sid Vicious vs. Goldberg - The battle of the millennium men as this feud was building for months as Sid was calling out Goldberg for months & even promoting his own undefeated winning streak in WCW.  Earlier in the night, Goldberg attacked Sid backstage & busted him wide open & Sid refused to let it be stitched up.  Due to all those circumstances, this match was a huge disappointment as Sid was already weakened when he came out & Goldberg kept focusing on his bleeding head while Sid didn't get much offense in at all as he was selling the loss of blood.  Goldberg ended up winning the match & the U.S. title as a result of the referee stopping the match.  Again, a huge disappointment.<br /><br />Strap Match: Ric Flair vs. Diamond Dallas Page - This was turned into a strap match earlier in the night by DDP and this wasn't a normal strap match where you have to touch all four corners, you could win by pinfall/submission.  After stalling for a while to get the strap hooked up, it was a wild brawl in itself as they lashed each other with the strap & used it in various ways to choke each other before DDP wrapped the strap around Flair's neck for the Diamond Cutter & the win.  The match was very good but the aftermath was the highlight as Kimberly lowblowed David Flair on the outside & handed his crowbar to DDP who just used it to complete unleash his rage on everyone in sight like referee Charles Robinson & Flair with various lowblows on his own leading to Ric leaving the building in the ambulance...that was highjacked by the Filthy Animals with Flair inside of it.<br /><br />WCW Champion Sting vs. Goldberg - After what happened with Hogan, Sting issued an open challenge that Goldberg accepted.  This match wasn't much as it was just Sting hitting a few moves on Goldberg for him to recover with the spear & jackhammer to get the quick victory.  The controversy behind this match (the commentators say that it wasn't a title match yet Goldberg was crowned the new WCW Champion) along with Sting dropping Charles Robinson after the match setup Sting being stripped of the WCW Title & setting up the tournament for the next PPV called Mayhem (which Bret Hart won).<br /><br />Also throughout the night, various segments happened such as Buff Bagwell showing up & calling out Jeff Jarrett (who wrestled at No Mercy the previous week & jumped to WCW the next day) who knocked Buff out the gutair earlier in the week for him talking about his dislike for the heads of WCW.

The match was very good but the aftermath was the highlight as Kimberly lowblowed David Flair on the outside & handed his crowbar to DDP who just used it to complete unleash his rage on everyone in sight like referee Charles Robinson & Flair with various lowblows on his own leading to Ric leaving the building in the ambulance...that was highjacked by the Filthy Animals with Flair inside of it.    WCW Champion Sting vs. Goldberg - After what happened with Hogan, Sting issued an open challenge that Goldberg accepted.  This match wasn't much as it was just Sting hitting a few moves on Goldberg for him to recover with the spear & jackhammer to get the quick victory.  The controversy behind this match (the commentators say that it wasn't a title match yet Goldberg was crowned the new WCW Champion) along with Sting dropping Charles Robinson after the match setup Sting being stripped of the WCW Title & setting up the tournament for the next PPV called Mayhem (which Bret Hart won).    Also throughout the night, various segments happened such as Buff Bagwell showing up & calling out Jeff Jarrett (who wrestled at No Mercy the previous week & jumped to WCW the next day) who knocked Buff out the gutair earlier in the week for him talking about his dislike for the heads of WCW.

630469654X|5.0|I cry everytime I watch this movie.  I'm not much for the romantic boo-hoo films, but this one is an exception.  It is heartbreaking to see what these two sacrifice just to be near each other.  True Love is one of the most exhilarating and wonderful feelings you could ever experience.  But it is also one of the worst kinds of pain you could ever feel.  This movie really expounds on that truth.  When you love someone so greatly and so completely you will stop at nothing to be with them, do anything to keep them safe and give up everything just to see them happy.
031237593X|5.0|15 years ago a friend loaned me this book and I fell in love with this talented author's writing.  After this book I read everything available by Sharon Kay Penman and then began to read anything to do with British medieval history.      Penman painstakingly researched her subjects and brought them to life as no one else could.  I fell in love with Richard who as a 5 year old boy lost in the woods proved his absolute loyality to his older brother. This is the brother who would become Edward IV.  He was willing to say he was in the wrong rather then get his shining brother, \\"Ned\\" into trouble with their mother.      He faced the horrors of war, the loss of his father and brother in a brutal massacre and he became a great, loyal, honorable man.  I despise the stories that claim he was a hunchback with a withered arm.  As if any man who could fight with a broad sword and lead men into battle would be anything less then a strong fighter in his own right.      The years that Richard suffered to prepare both mind and body to be worthy of a great knight are proof that he had to be in superb condition. But the lies that Henry VII put out were believed by Shakespeare and used to malign him further in history.     It's such a wonderful tale of love, battles, defeat, glory, men who fall lose everything & fight their way back, wonderful women and the greed of the Queen's family that helped bring down the dynasty.      I can't believe it has not been made into a movie. What is wrong with Hollywood?  We see so many movies with men and armor fighting with broadswords.  Everyone loves these stories.  Will someone wake up?    I have 2 favorite books and this is one of them.
6305252572|4.0|This movie may look slightly dated now, but Eddie Murphy's film debut in this flick still remains one of his best. I still find parts of this movie simply brilliant, and Nick Nolte's performance is equally as good, as cop Jack Cates and convict Reggie Hammond constantly spar verbally and physically, but with the same goals in mind. The performances and strength of the characters really bring out both the drama and comedy in this film, which balance superbly.    I won't bother going into the story as many other reviewers have done this, but this movie is simply hilarious in places and is a must see for anyone who likes an adult-comedy movie. For the record, the sequel is equally as good.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|This is a light Hitchcock movie, probably not one of his greatest, but pretty close!  The film does not focus on murder or mayhem or even tragedy.  It is all about stealing jewels!  If you thought that jewel thieves were interesting, this is your movie.  If not, here the movie grows on you and you won't care about it being about jewel thieves.  The acting is superlative and funny.  It is not made in a serious manner and that is great.  The movie is about being on vacation, seeing the French Rivera and being with wealthy people who have their jewels stolen.  It's fun and light.
B000002O1Q|5.0|The variety of genres spans the album and it works as a great road trip CD as well as suitable backdrop for the film.  The sequence of songs does not follow the film, but the album is the better for it. Great Songs/songwriters are the key  Tom Petty and Benmont Tench (He could never be you) Stevie Nicks (Sorcerer)Dan Hartman(I can dream about you) and Ry Cooder(Hold that Snake)-also the music director for the film make the music meaningful outside the movie theater.   orchestral rock, blues, R&B and rockabilly all come together in a tight little package that will get you from here to there

Mary's mother said that when she died, she wanted Mary to leave their little farm and go live with her aunt Patience. Trying to look out for her daughter, Mary's mom was afraid that life would be too hard for a young girl on a farm by herself and wanted her to have an easier life. Little did she know the fate of things to come.<br /><br />With all her belongs packed into a small trunk, Mary set out for Jamaica Inn, which was owned by her Aunt Patience and her Uncle Joss. Mary had only met Patience once, but remembered her mother's sister as a vivacious and carefree woman. But when she told the coach driver where she was going, he tried to talk her out of it. He said no one went to Jamaica Inn, especially a young woman. It was an evil place. However, Mary had promised her dying mother, and good or bad she had to keep that promise.<br /><br />When Mary arrived on that cold, rainy night, however, she found that Aunt Patience was no longer the young vivacious woman she used to be. She was older, thinner, and perpetually frightened. She was a shell of the woman she used to be. And the man she married, Joss Meryln was a huge, hulking man with a mean streak a mile long and an evil glint in his eye. Joss told Mary she was to help out around the Inn and as long as she minded her own business, everything would be fine.<br /><br />But Jamaica Inn was no travelers Inn. It was old, crumbling and falling apart. No one every stayed there. Mary couldn't figure out how the Merlyn's made any living off of it.....until the night when she was woken from her sleep by all the wagons. As she peered out the window (when she wasn't supposed to do), she saw a bunch of men unloading boxes into the storage rooms in the Inn. As she snuck downstairs to get a better look, she overheard her uncle threaten a man who wanted \\"out\\".<br /><br />But just when Mary was trying to figure out a way to get her Aunt Patience away from this place, a strange man stopped at the Inn.

In fact, I hadn't even heard of it before I started looking for books to fit into the challenge. From page one, du Maurier ran with the \\"eerie, dark\\" Gothic setting and told a brilliant story. Mary was a smart, strong, independent young woman in a time when those qualities were not usually used to describe a woman. Jem was the proverbial \\"bad boy\\". A handsome horse thief that was fun and likable, du Maurier created a great anti-hero in Jem. Will he do the right thing in the end.....or will he be just another Merlyn?? I guess you will have to read the book to find out!!<br /><br />For a book that was written over 70 years ago, Jamaica Inn was incredibly readable and highly entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely.

0316168815|3.0|With over 2500 reviews already, it is hard to add something meaningful to the evaluation of this book but hopefully some people will find the following useful.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is a difficult book to read with any enjoyment. The thing that mars the book for me is the way in which the young girl who narrates the story from heaven, Susie Salmon, is killed. She is brutally raped and murdered and then her body is dismembered by a sadistic neighbor who is not immediately apprehended and who consequently haunts the book with his presence.  In my view it was not necessary to the basic theme of the book--dealing with loss--for Susie to die in this fashion. A more ordinary death--accident, illness--would have served the author's purpose just as well. Thus it seems an unnecssary bit of sick sensatonalism to have her die in such a gruesome manner.<br /><br />As I started to read the various responses of the family to Susie's death I was reminded of the opening lines of Anna Karenina:  \\"Happy families are all alike. Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\\"  Clearly the Salmon family has a right to be unhappy., but one wonders about the impact the death has on them, particularly, Jack the father. The death of one's child is perhaps the greatest sorrow one has to face in life, yet Jack Salmon had two other children and should have remained strong for their sake. In a family that is fundamentally happy and strong, such would have been the case. Thus the way the family comes apart is indicative of a fundamental flaw in its makeup. The one member who comes across as the strongest is a bit of an outsider--Grandma Lynn.<br /><br />The strength of the book is in the matter-of-fact teen age tone that Sebold is able to give to Susie. She is able to comment on the events that occur on earth with that still-innocent manner of a young girl who despite experiencing the ultimate tragedy and despite being unable to impact what happens to the living remains optimistic. It is the response of Susie's friends and peers that comes across as most appropriate and realistic, while that of the family seems more stereotypical.<br /><br />The comments on the back cover (from Time magazine's review of the book) may best describe the book:  It is, above all, a novel which finds light in the darkest of places, and shows how even when that light seems to be utterly extinguished, it is still there, waiting to be rekindled.\\" If you can see the book from this perspective it can have meaning for you.sponse of Susie's friends and peers that comes across as most appropriate and realistic, while that of the family seems more stereotypical.

0060853972|5.0|\\"God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players [i.e. everybody], to being involved in an obscure and complex variant of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.\\"<br /><br />The end of the world is coming.....what are you going to do? For angel Aziraphale and demon Crowley, that is the question. After spending centuries on Earth, they've become friends....sort of. And they actually LIKE it here. They don't want a war between the \\"sides\\". So when the Antichrist is born, the two of them take it upon themselves to \\"watch\\" him to see if they can stop him from becoming evil. If they work together, maybe they can keep him from choosing between Good and Evil, and postpone Armageddon. Sounds like a good plan, doesn't it??<br /><br />But due to a mix up at birth, the son of the American Diplomat is not really the Antichrist. He's just a normal 11-year-old boy. The real Antichrist is named Adam, and he lives in Lower Tadfield, England. Raised by normal English parents, he has friends and a dog (the Hell-Hound has become a normal, little dog that likes to terrorize cats). He doesn't even realize the power he possesses. Can this seemingly normal little boy actually become the purveyor of the end of the world??<br /><br />All of this has been prophecized by Agnes Nutter, a witch in the seventeenth century. She was the only true prophet that ever lived. She even wrote a book, called The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch. Unfortunately, the book didn't sell very well. In fact, it didn't sell at all. Not that it mattered to Agnes; she just wanted the author copy anyway. And that copy is now in the hands of one of her descendants, Anathema Device, a witch of her accord, who is also trying to stop the end of the world.<br /><br />There are also the four horseman of the Apocalypse, who have assembled to usher in the end of the world. However, they aren't horseman, but bikers. REAL Hell's Angels to be exact. War, Famine, Death and Pollution (Pestilence had to retire after the discovery of Penicillin). Now the race is on to find the real Antichrist, and depending on your side, either save or end the world!<br /><br />A satirical look at Armageddon, this book is also kind of parody of the movie, The Omen. When Warlock (the boy everyone THINKS is the Antichrist) is young, his Nanny buys him a tricycle. But she can never get him to ride it in the house! The irony and wit in this book astounds me! A. Crowley (ie Crawley) was the serpent in the Garden of Eden; The tempter. Aleister Crowley, in real life, was the famous Satanist or occultist. Which makes this line even funnier:<br />  \\"Crowley always found [Satanists] embarrassing. You couldn't actually be rude to them, but you couldn't help feeling about them the same way that, say, a Vietnam veteran would feel about someone who wears combat gear to Neighborhood Watch meetings.\\"<br /><br />What Pratchett and Gaiman have done with this book is take a horrible, scary, evil happening and make it humorous. But in the midst of all the fun, they make some really valid points:<br />  \\"There had been times, over the past millennium, when Crowley had felt like sending a message back Below saying, Look, we may as well give up right now, we may as well shut down Dis and Pandemonium and everywhere and move up here,there's nothing we can do to them [humans] that they don't do themselves and they do things we've never even thought of, often involving electrodes.\\"<br /><br />But in the end, they leave it up the wisdom of an 11-year-old kid, who just happens to be the Antichrist. And I guess this says something for the whole nature vs. nurture debate.<br /><br />\\"I don't see what's so triffic about creating people as people and then gettin' upset 'cos they act like people,\\" said Adam severely. \\"Anyway, if you stopped tellin' people it's all sorted out after they're dead, they might try sorting it all out while they're alive.\\"<br /><br />I realize I'm kind of all over the place with this review. That's because the book is kind of all over the place. It's not the easiest book to review, that's for sure. But I'll tell you this: This is one fantastic book!! If I didn't already have a total crush on Neil Gaiman, I'd fall in love all over after reading this one. Of course, now I'm totally enamoured with Pratchett too. The end of the world doesn't have to be all doom and gloom. It can be positively hilarious!!

B00188KD1Y|2.0|\\"Death Race\\" is an action-lover's dream, a film overloaded with shootouts and explosions and crashes and mangled bodies, all to the eye-popping backdrop of back-to-back car chases. The music and sound effects are loud and assaulting, pretty much to the point of drowning out thought. That's probably what the filmmakers wanted, because God knows if anyone actually stopped to think about this film, they would realize how aggravating it is, not just in terms of the overwhelming action, but also in terms of the story, which is about as inconsequential as they get in films these days. It kind of makes you wonder why writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson even bothered with a screenplay, since all he really wanted was to blind us with stunts and deafen us with tire squeals and fireballs. It would be a miracle if a theater's sound system survived this film.    I suppose this is a case of self-punishment, seeing as this is technically the second time I've seen this movie. I was invited to a special sneak preview back in April, and I accepted with the hope that I'd at least find it entertaining. Boy, was I in for a rude awakening. Still, it wasn't a completed version of the film, so I figured I'd give it another chance come general release. Who knows? Maybe Anderson and editor Niven Howie would use that four-month period to rework the film, to somehow make it tolerable for the rest of us. Unfortunately, not much has changed; it seems that Anderson wanted to make nothing more than an extended stunt montage, filled to the brim with high-speed race scenes and dangerous weapons and characters that die violent, bloody deaths. If this is the kind of movie you crave, then Anderson has delivered exactly as he promised. For this particular audience, \\"Death Race\\" is dedicated.    It has a story, but does anyone really care? And is it worth noting that it's based on the 1975 film \\"Death Race 2000\\"? In both cases, probably not. But I'll describe the story anyway, just in case. By the year 2012, many of the world's economies have collapsed. In the United States alone, unemployment is dramatically rising, and worse yet, major corporations have taken over the prison systems. They've profited essentially by turning penitentiaries into arenas, forcing the inmates to become gladiators. One prison on Terminal Island hosts a regular event called Death Race, which broadcasts live on the Internet to massive ratings. For Death Race, competitors drive heavily armored vehicles through an obstacle course, and in the end, it's just as much about staying alive as it is about winning. To make things more interesting, all cars are allowed to use weapons, including machine guns, oil, smoke, napalm, missiles, and spikes. The incentive is freedom; whoever wins five races will be released from prison.    Here enters Jensen Ames (Jason Statham), imprisoned after being framed for murdering his wife. He was once a famous racecar driver, something the warden of Terminal Island--the icy Hennessy (Joan Allen)--quickly picks up on. She offers him a deal: If he wins the next installment of Death Race, she will set him free. There's one catch. He has to pose as the most popular driver, Frankenstein, so named because he wore a mask over his horribly disfigured face. Unbeknownst to viewers and most of the prisoners, the real Frankenstein died; Hennessy knows that ratings depend on keeping his legend alive. With this in mind, the soft-voiced Ames goes along with the plan, holding out hope that he will someday see his infant daughter again.    All this setup material passes before anything of value sinks in. The rest of the film is a wall-to-wall series of brutal race scenes, all of which are visually and aurally aggressive. Eyes and ears alike will throb in pain by the time this movie ends. How can we enjoy it if it doesn't allow us to take in what's happening? The filmmakers relied on editing so lightening-fast, we barely notice one shot transitioning to the next. The few shots that go in slow motion are reserved for the racecar navigators, who, of course, are young, sexy women. You know the kind of shots I'm talking about; as they exit a car or a building, a sluggish camera captures close-ups of hair flipping gracefully and well-proportioned breasts heaving ever so delicately. They supposedly come from a women's correctional facility. One wonders: Are all female prisoners this good-looking in real life?    The navigator assigned to Ames is Case (Natalie Martinez), who, with the exception of one small bruise, remains miraculously unharmed after each race. Ames' mechanic is a man named Coach (Ian McShane), and he's grown so accustomed to life on Terminal Island that he refuses to leave, even if he's eligible for parole. And then there's Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson), who has a score to settle with Frankenstein. One question that inevitably comes up is who framed Ames. If you've seen the trailer for \\"Death Race,\\" then you already know the answer. If you haven't, it still isn't all that surprising, given the intelligence of the screenplay. I know movies like this will find an audience, no matter how much curmudgeons like me may complain about it. But doesn't it make you wonder why? Does no one appreciate a good story anymore? Is death and destruction all we have left? Are mindless stunts on their way to replacing actual plots? It's frightening to think that films like \\"Death Race\\" may be the rule instead of the exception.
B0015D3YQI|5.0|It's been said that \\"Phenomena\\" is the movie Argento wanted to make with \\"Suspiria\\", the latter being cast with actresses well out of their teens.  Here, much younger actresses are used, including Argento's own daughter, Fiore, who has the opening (amazing) death scene.  Fourteen year old Jennifer Connelly is our lead, and Argento must have been quite taken with her, as she is lovingly framed and lighted in every scene.  There are numerous similarities with \\"Suspiria\\".  Just as Suzy is chastised for arriving at the European school from America late, so is Jennifer.  The girls at this school are also odd, and while Suzy is drugged in \\"Suspiria\\", someone attempts to do the same with Jennifer.<br /><br />The kills are stylish as ever, great lighting, camera work, cinematography, and a very interesting story.  I think this is the first Argento where I cared about the characters-Those being Jennifer, and the Entomologist and his chimp.  By the way, the Chimp has a really wrenching scene where she is desparately trying to get into the house while her master is being menaced by the killer.  Many other noteworthy scenes include Jennifer sleepwalking, Jennifer summoning insects to her aid in the school, and the reveal of the killer.  The soundtrack by Goblin is incredible per usual, and I didn't mind the heavy Metal music used as well.  Some weird stuff, some gross stuff,  and Argento's most gorgeous heroine to date.  I am amazed to find I like this even better than Suspiria.  If you are just getting into Argento, or thinking of, this is a great movie to try.  I absolutely adore this film.  Oh, and in the cab ride to the school, (You knew there would be a cab ride, right?)  Daria Nicolodi's character tells Jennifer, \\"They call this area the Swiss Transylvania, you know.\\"  Jennifer:  \\"Really?  Why?\\"  Daria:  \\"I don't know, they just do.\\"  I love the randomness of the Argento dialogue!

0345501292|4.0|Written by the same author as the equally-awesome The Making of Star Wars (which I own but sadly have not yet read), this book is the definitive tale of how all four Indiana Jones films were made. Beginning in 1977 on a beach in Hawaii and ending in 2008 with the release of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, it is a filmmakers dream: a look into the minds and practices of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, two of the great geniuses of modern film. It takes you through story development, casting, pre, pro, and post-production - it's a great learning experience. Not to mention Indy is the greatest action hero - ever. And that is why it is awesome.    My only complaint is that the chapters pretty much get progressively shorter and less in-depth, with the most time being spent on Raiders. This is kind of understandable, seeing as Raiders started the franchise and required the most development. But it was still a bit disappointing to not have some of the interesting details about the sequels highlighted.

B000Q66PXE|4.0|Got this for my husband's birthday.  He is a history buff and watches anything about the Roman empire.  It is barbaric at times with language that today we might find offensive although it is used, full of scheming and lies.  He enjoyed it so much that he has watched it four times.  He was sorry to see HBO not continue into a third season.  He said \\"it's pretty clear why Rome fell\\" and we had better pay attention to what's going on now.  He felt it was true to the history of Rome with some artistic license taken.  Scenery and costumes were very good.  Also the director's cuts are enjoyable.
B00190OHD6|2.0|The plot line seemed interesting but I could not buy the characters.  Most of the emotion in this movie was so contrived that it took away from the value of the movie.<br /><br />I think this movie would have benefit from lower budget actors and a slight script re-write that could (hopefully) result in more empathy from an audience.  Instead, the movie attempted to shoe horn actors and actresses with huge screen presence into very limited character roles.

B001A4LYN2|5.0|This movie was truly amazing.  The gritty acting, the writing, the camera work--everything was spot on perfect!  The movie depicts the rise of a California oil barron, starting from discovering his oil well.  The acting by Lewis was just amazing!  I strongly recommend this movie to you.  It can be a bit slow--it is a drama and has the pace of something like Castaway, although there is much more dialog in There Will Be Blood.
B000VAHBJC|5.0|The lilting poetry of Suzanne lures the listener into Cohen's world of romantic despair while introducing the essence of his sound: a deep monotone framed by sublime female backing vocals over simple but engaging melodies. Master Song, Winter Lady and Stranger Song reinforce the desolate landscape although the melodies are less immediate. Cohen's genius shines brightly on the immortal Sisters Of Mercy, a strange mixture of the spiritual and the sensual that must be one of the most beautiful musical poems in the English language.<br /><br />This delicate gem is followed by the powerful and evocative So Long Marianne and the understated Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye, both masterpieces of words, melody and arrangement - the female vocals on Goodbye is especially impressive. Stories of the Street appears as a poem in one of Cohen's 1960s poetry books: [[ASIN:0670002348 Selected Poems 1956-1968]] and deals with a visit to Havana during of just after the revolution. Interesting fact: The line \\"some girls wander by mistake\\" from Teachers was later used as an album title by the goth band Sisters Of Mercy: [[ASIN:B000005RMY Some Girls Wander By Mistake]]<br /><br />One Us Cannot Be Wrong addresses the beloved in a series of strange images before moving on to melodic whistling and ending with bitter shouted la la lahs. For those interested in other artists' take on Cohen: Suzanne has been beautifully covered by inter alia Judy Collins [[ASIN:B0002M5TE8 Sings Leonard Cohen: Democracy]] and Geoffrey Oryema on [[ASIN:B000002ISX I'm Your Fan]], while Sting and the Chieftains' celtic version of Sisters Of Mercy is available on the [[ASIN:B000001EZK Tower of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen]] tribute album. On I'm Your Fan there are interesting interpretations of Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye by Ian McCulloch, Stories Of The Street by That Petrol Emotion and So Long Marianne by James.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|Christian Bale is  the best choice to play Batman so far. This is a much more believable Caped Crusader and less cartoonish take on a well known character that has been around some sixty odd years. As a young boy I was a fan of the television series with Adam West and found the premise aptly geared toward younger viewers. Today's Batman is a hero for all ages and this first installment will set the standard for quite some time. Having seen the Dark Knight and finding it equally as good if not better I can only hope that Bale will stay on board in the title role for at least a few more. Someone with his talent needn't worry about type casting as he makes any part his own. If the cape fits, wear it!
0823023494|5.0|This book by Tom Bancroft was a very entertaining and helpful read. I am not a professional in the field of animation or illustration, but I am trying to learn how to improve my skills in the area of character design in hopes of moving into this field in the future. This book does an excellent job of covering all the different facets involved in designing and bringing to life a drawing with real personality. It teaches the basic principles needed to convey character types, emotion, and personality with many helpful examples.     The two best \\"stand-out\\" features of the book to me are the guest artists who each come from a different field of \\"cartooning\\"; whether it be humorous cartooning, tv animation, comic books, or feature film animation, to name a few. It was very interesting and informative to read these professional's take on designing the same character, and to see how each artist approached it. The other \\"stand-out\\" feature was the progression of assignments given throughout the book. These really helped me get a feel for what a real assignment could actually be like for a character designer. They were very helpful in allowing me to think through the process of designing each character for the \\"script\\" provided in the assignments.    All in all, my hat's off to Tom and company for a wonderful resource for aspiring professionals and hobby artists alike. Definitely a wonderful investment!
B000BAQ8A0|5.0|A very imaginative version of the opera.  It is well done and the contrast between the black and white scenes and the use of color towards the end were remarkable.  It holds the viewers attention with singers who can also act.  I viewed it with my 11 year old granddaughter and she was never bored and asked questions which made it evident she was captivated by the story.  I recommend it for all ages.

Yes, it's a 16bit recording, but it sounds 400x better than this remastered version.<br />The remastered offering is over filtered on the high band, so it sounds like AM radio \\"low to mid-range sound\\".<br />The sound engineer really dropped the ball on this CD.<br /><br />I recommend buying the \\"unmastered\\" version.
B000002H4C|5.0|The soundtrack to the animated 1981 movie HEAVY METAL is absolutely wonderful, even though the movie itself was pretty tasteless. One band on here, Riggs, contributed members to Pat Travers' band. Several other artists here- Sammy Hagar, Nazareth, Stevie Nicks, Grand Funk Railroad, Don Felder,  Blue Oyster Cult, and Journey- oppose Indonesia's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, as well as creating a great soundtrack that makes even the most tasteless visual imagery worthwhile. So my advice is, buy the CD, don't see the movie.

0596522347|5.0|Remember Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth slides? They were designed by this author. That initially caught my attention, but the great contemporary design and well-written information kept me interested. I've been looking for a good book on PowerPoint design for awhile...I've finally found a great one! Here's why. Most books about PowerPoint simply tell you how to use the program; however this book teaches about creating effective and dazzling slides. It walks you through the process of brainstorming, storyboarding, organization and finally design. It helps with developing a concept and especially the artistic aspect. Some tips she provides: use visual metaphors, the less text the better, and the 3 second rule (the audience must understand the slide within 3 seconds). She also provides many case studies so there are plenty of examples and inspiration showing good powerpoint design.    I'm a graphic designer and frequently have to design powerpoints for clients. I've found designing for powerpoints particularly challenging because it's easy for the presentations to look cliche, resembling too much of a template, with challenging color contrasts and text integration. To add to this, often I'm told by clients they want lots of bullet points and way too many slides. But now I've already begun to notice an improvement in my slides' effectiveness. I highly recommend this book!    I also recommend [[ASIN:0321525655 Presentation Zen:]]. It offers many great suggestions too and even has a case study featuring this author.
B0013J30W2|3.0|The story is comfortable and entertaining, but not original. And that's okay.<br /><br />Remember the first commercials for the new Volkswagon Beetle? The ones that followed an office worker around while playing ELO music? In the commercials, it was clear that the poor guy's only hope of breaking out of the hum-drum work-a-day world was ... to buy a Beetle. For the first 20 minutes of Wanted, I kid you not, you get, almost the same commercial, but our hero's only way to break out is to follow Angelina Jolie into a life of assassinations and brutality, the latter inflicted on himself. From that point until almost the very end, the movie plays just like Star Wars Episode IV (that's the first one, right?) The ending is interesting and unexpected. Which is to say the first ending. The second ending seems to have been added for \\"closure\\" but I would have been fine leaving the first ending as-is.<br /><br />All the performances were solid. Angelina Jolie had about 5 lines. Morgan Freeman could add gravitas to a Lucky Charms commerical, and James McAvoy is fine (not inspired or memorable, but suitable in the role.) The effects are comic-book (which makes sense considering the origin of the material) and they sometimes make you go, \\"Wow!\\" This includes car chases, roof top action, and the ability to \\"bend\\" bullets like David Beckham bends soccer balls.<br /><br />There is one critical plot point that seems to have been lost in the rewrites concerning the guy in the first scene. After you watch the movie, think back to that guy and what he was doing. I think continuity slipped up there and its a biggie.<br /><br />Overall, its a fun flick and worth a rent.

This book, consisting of correspondence - letters and telegrams, tells the story of a group of people on the island of Guernsey who do what they can to survive the hardships of war and occupation, while sharing a love of books (or in one case, a single life-changing book).<br /><br />The focus of the correspondence is one Juliet Ashton, a writer in London in 1946 who happens to be looking for the subject of her next book.  She receives a letter from a stranger, a man who lives in Guernsey, who is a book lover, and she ultimately \\"meets\\" and gets to know the members of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.<br /><br />As Juliet becomes more acquainted with these people, so do we.  Each letter or telegram reveals a new layer of intimacy, a new way of looking at these hardy folk who managed to live through one of the darkest periods in the 20th century.<br /><br />I found myself wanting to know even more -- I became totally interested in these characters.<br /><br />And that, for me, is the sign of a good book.

B00005JLEU|4.0|This is a beautiful and fantastic movie and well represents Japanese spiritual world such as the concept of Yaoyorozu-no-kami (eight million kami). But, actually, I am not sure why this is the most popular Ghibli movie in America. I think even for Japanese it is difficult to understand some of scenes. Miyazaki used a lot of abstract and symbolic elements and they made this movie more complicated than his other movies such as My Neighbor Totoro, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, and Princess Mononoke.    But I would say this is still a very interesting movie and some scenes have left a strong impression on my mind. I like the scene where Chihiro eats rice balls with weeping tears.

1416550518|3.0|\\"The House at Riverton\\" centers on the lives of Grace Bradley, a housemaid at the English country estate of Riverton and two of its residents, sisters Hannah and Emmeline.  The novel spans the years of 1914 to 1924 in Essex and London.  During a soir&eacute;e at Riverton, a young poet, Robbie Hunter, commits suicide and only the two sisters and Grace are witnesses to the truth behind his tragic death.<br /><br />The novel begins in 1999 with a 98-year-old Grace, now nearing her end as a resident in a nursing home.  A filmmaker who's directing a retrospective of Riverton approaches her, eager to plumb her memories of the house, her years of service and Robbie's death.  This project becomes a catalyst for Grace's revelations of her time at Riverton and the disastrous misunderstanding that led to that fateful night.  The story unfolds through flashbacks, alternating between the early 1900s and 1999.<br /><br />One can almost tell that Ms. Morton is a romantic at heart.  Her characters are imbued with the tragic romanticism pervasive in historical fiction.  Whether this is a welcome element or not depends greatly on the reader's preferences.  I find it to be tedious only because I prefer stark realism.  (For example, it would have been far more interesting for me if WWI had been woven into the characters' lives in more than a cursory way, considering that it toppled four empires and its casualties numbered in the tens of millions.)  Even setting that aside, the \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" redux here is too obvious.  The characters that populated the 1970s miniseries are unashamedly `resurrected' so to speak--Mr. Hudson is now Mr. Hamilton, Mrs. Bridges is now Mrs. Townsend, Ruby is now Katie, Rose is now Grace, etc.  One can almost `hear' Gordon Jackson, Jean Marsh and Angela Baddeley `speaking' the dialogues in this novel.<br /><br />There are two mysteries in the story--first is Grace's paternity, and second is what really happened the night Robbie supposedly killed himself.  The first can be easily discounted.  Only the most inattentive of readers will miss the clues that were evident by page 50.  Ms. Morton doesn't so much as drop or couch clues as she allows them to sprout hands and wave hello.  Not a good thing for a mystery.  The second is treated much better, and though one can still guess the secrets Grace has been keeping for decades, the truth is still satisfactory since it is incorporated in a very touching way to her final days with her family.<br /><br />Re the plot, Ms. Morton has dutifully listed the sources of her inspiration, but I have some difficulty reconciling `inspiration' with the `lifting' of plot points.  Anyone who has read Margaret Atwood's \\"The Blind Assassin\\" or L. P. Hartley's \\"The Go-Between\\" or Barbara Vine's \\"A Dark-Adapted Eye\\" will immediately recognize the similarities.  (Even the book's opening line is derivative of du Maurier.)  Re the devices, there's nothing new with an elderly person nearing the end of his/her life needing to reveal decades-long secrets through flashbacks (\\"The Thirteenth Tale,\\" \\"The Brimstone Wedding,\\" \\"The Chatham School Affair,\\" \\"The Sixth Lamentation,\\" etc.).  Same with the unexplainable `lure' of a manor (Manderley, anyone?), the noblesse oblige of the upper class, past secrets that haunt the present, female frustration over restrictive social mores, hysteria, etc.  Even a casual reader of Gothic already knows these devices and tropes by heart.<br /><br />I appreciate the fact that historical fiction is a daunting challenge to a writer who, at the minimum, has to accurately depict the place, time and lingo of a past era.  However, there are minor flubs here that could have been easily caught by the editor.  (Ms. Morton is Australian writing in the voice of an Englishwoman.)  `Cane' should have been `walking stick'; `ma', `da', `wee' are Highlands-speak, the characters are English, not Scottish; `Selfridge's' as anyone who's shopped in London knows should be `Selfridges'; `haberdashers' sell notions if they still exist, they certainly don't sell Dictaphones; `salary' ought to be `wages'; Grace buys Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"The Valley of Fear\\" before it is published as a book when it would have been more believable for her to have read Strand Magazine's prior serialization of it; the carrying of handguns was not outlawed until the 1950s, yet here, it occurs in the 1920s; etc.<br /><br />Call \\"The House at Riverton\\" derivative or pastiche--both are true--but, surprisingly, it still manages to be an enjoyable read, especially its latter chapters.  Lovers of historical fiction will derive much pleasure and may be much more forgiving than I've been.  For a first effort, the writing is skillful, and if one dismisses from the mind the many sources of its characters and plot, it really can be engrossing.they certainly don't sell Dictaphones; `salary' ought to be `wages'; Grace buys Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"The Valley of Fear\\" before it is published as a book when it would have been more believable for her to have read Strand Magazine's prior serialization of it; the carrying of handguns was not outlawed until the 1950s, yet here, it occurs in the 1920s; etc.    Call \\"The House at Riverton\\" derivative or pastiche--both are true--but, surprisingly, it still manages to be an enjoyable read, especially its latter chapters.

B000BUYP4Q|5.0|In Batman Begins, director Christopher Nolan gave us the most realistic and, at the same time, the most faithful-to-comic-book representation of Batman yet - or of any comic book hero, for that matter (at least until Iron Man). It is a great story of origins, as well as of character. The film is full of quotes that tell you who Batman is and what he is about: such as Alfred's \\"Why do we fall - so we can learn to pick ourselves up;\\" or Rachel's \\"It's not who you are underneath - it's what you do that defines you,\\" which Batman later repeats about himself; or Batman's \\"I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you,\\" which he speaks to Liam Neeson's character right before his demise. Batman Begins is a well-defined story about a well-defined character that is both uplifting and meaningful.<br /><br />I also think Christian Bale is the definitive Batman. Batman is about the costume, the \\"muscle,\\" the eyes, the mouth and the voice. Christian Bale has all of that. Plus, he makes a great Bruce Wayne and has the best Alfred you could possibly ask for - Michael Caine; the perfect Rachel to be sweet on - Katie Holmes; a terrific Jim Gordon to work with - Gary Oldman; and the added character of Lucius Fox, played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman. Wayne Manor and the Batcave are both perfect. Only the Batmobile may disappoint some die-hard fans because it doesn't LOOK like the Batmobile - but it is fun. You've got the perfect nemesis in Liam Neeson, and the perfect Scarecrow in Cillian Murphy. Everything is perfect. I gave the film 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Now enter The Dark Knight.<br /><br />Why is it that directors and producers think Batman is about the villains - it's not. They are merely the foils off which Batman plays. Tim Burton's series featured one villain in the first film - the Joker, played wonderfully by Jack Nicholson. Then he started stacking villains and super heroes, so that, by the end of the series, there was very little room left for Batman. In the fourth film, Batman And Robin, for which Burton was not actually responsible - he was canned as director after Batman Returns, and as producer after Batman Forever - there was Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Batman, Robin, Batgirl, and a host of others. Dark Knight has the Joker and Two-Face, and that's one too many, because it adds an additional 45 minutes to the film that kills the momentum and has the audience squirming in their seats. Dark Knight should just have been about Batman and his attempts to defeat the Joker.<br /><br />The Joker is supposed to be funny, in a warped sort of way. In Dark Knight, he is not, nor does he even try to be. So, really, it is not the Joker but a Joker-like character that appears in the film. Since Nolan wrote the script, he can be blamed for that. He doesn't seem to understand the Joker. Heath Ledger is playing a psychopath wearing bad make-up. That is not who the Joker is. Jack Nicholson had a far better take on the Joker, more reflective of the DC Comics character.<br /><br />Heath Ledger was not a great actor. But the fact that he is dead, and died at the end of this filming - probably because of the strain placed on him playing the Joker - makes him something of a curiosity. That, in my opinion, is the only reason Dark Knight is doing as well as it is at the box office and with critics. Once the DVD comes out, I seriously doubt if it will sell as well as Batman Begins because, by then, people will have had time to think about it. It's not a great film. It is a good film, but it has some major problems - besides the length, which is almost three hours. What does Ledger actually do in Dark Knight that could be interpreted as acting other than lick his lips so many times that it becomes annoying? He's playing a crazy man. How hard can that be? Mel Gibson made a career out of playing crazy people. It's not that difficult. The Joker character should be more than that.<br /><br />Batman Begins was a straight-forward story about origins and character, and was full of memorable quotes. The Dark Knight is a convoluted story about what we can become if we focus too long on darkness. Duh. The only memorable quote from the film is Harvey Dent's comment that is later taken up by Batman: \\"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\\" Dent actually fulfills his own prophecy, but Batman, luckily, does not. But it's an idiotic quote that history has easily disproved. And that is enough to hang a plot on? At the end of the film, when Two-Face has been stopped and Commissioner Gordon is trying to explain to his son, and to us, what has just happened, it is a tangled mess of meaningless ideas that is drowned out by the blaring music. Nolan dug himself into a hole and he could not, for the life of him, explain his way out of it.<br /><br />In addition to the convoluted story and web of empty themes, the actress playing Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a poor and homely substitute for Katie Holmes. One wonders what Nolan and his casting director were thinking - even though she gets killed off, which is some consolation. I guess that opens the door for Catwoman. Everyone else in the cast is good; but Nolan gave them less to work with this time around than he did previously. Aaron Eckhart as District Attorney Harvey Dent, who later becomes Two-Face, is the second major focus of the film after the Joker. What a mistake to have two scene-stealers in the same film, so that Christian Bale as Batman is really playing third fiddle.<br /><br />Here's a clue as to how good Dark Knight is as compared to Batman Begins: when I came out of Batman Begins, people were excited and raving to each other about the film, like they had been to a wedding or a sporting event. I watched their faces as they came out of Dark Knight: they were solemn and quiet, like they had been to a funeral. THAT tells me a lot. Something died in Dark Knight. Was it the series? I'm not looking forward to the third film because I have a good idea what is going to happen. (I hear Bale has a three-film contract, so it is inevitable.) If Nolan's third film is as stacked against Batman as this one was, if it is as convoluted, if the themes are as meaningless and the story as empty, there will be no dead actor to draw people to the box office - hopefully. Nolan is going to have to do some soul-searching, in my opinion, if he is going to recapture the magic of Batman Begins.<br /><br />Waitsel SmithDark Knight is a convoluted story about what we can become if we focus too long on darkness.

Plenty of heroism, plenty of hell.  And its all true.    All the war movies you've ever seen, all the glories-of-war books and novels you've ever read will shrink to insignficance in the pages of \\"Lone Survivor.\\" The co-author, Patrick Robinson, does a good job of writing, yet staying out of the way so the reader can hear, sense and feel Marcus Luttrell the SEAL who endured his horror, yet heroic story.    It is the story of the worst special forces disaster in American history, but it is a book that makes you proud, proud to be an American and proud of the American fighting man. How long has it been since you've heard anyone say that about a book on combat?    The climax of the book comes when Marcus Lutrell, after somehow surviving with the help of friendly Afghans an almost incomprehensible set of difficulties, comes face to face with the Taliban leader he and his SEAL mates were sent to kill.  What happens next is amazing, truly amazing and provocative, leaving the reader to wonder who really did win this face off, Marcus or the Taliban commander?  Both showed no fear and almost a sense of reverance and respect for each other---or did they?  Did they use each other in the end?  And how do you define \\"winning\\" in this sense of the word, in this situation?  Is \\"winning\\" mere survival or is it something more?    The book of our time on the military effort in Afghanistan.

0743486285|5.0|The day I heard Motley Crue I was addicted.  My 1st show was at UCSB w/ Cherry Bombz way back in the day when people would say \\"who\\".....  I saw them many times after that.  Nikki was my idol. After joining the Army and going overseas for a few years I lost touch with US bands in general. So......this book caught me up with what Nikki and the band were up too for my lost years.  It is a very interesting perspective on what really goes on behind stage doors and the emotions and feelings involved with drug use. It brings truth, it brings laughter and tears.  The way Nikki expressed his truthfullness about addiction, it helped me understand the how and why people are addicted and the hardship of quitting.  Interestingly enough I wonder why people would do that to themselves after reading this!  The book was down to earth from Nikki's heart and soul.
B00005JOFQ|2.0|I caught this on TV and found it kind of a boring cycle of hurt and comfort with a predictable ending. It just can't do justice to the Annie Proulx story. I actually didn't finish watching it. You could probably read the story in the same amount of time.
B0018M6J90|5.0|Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) is the governess of last resort.  No, that doesn't mean she turns naughty children around.  In fact, she doesn't seem to be able to keep a job.  Fired from her last job, she literally has nothing.  And her employment agency is tired of trying to find her jobs.  After all, jobs are scarce in 1930's London.  Desperate, Miss Pettigrew takes the address of a client, a Delysia Lafoose (Amy Adams).<br /><br />When Miss Pettigrew arrives at the address, she finds Delysia in crisis.  While saving the day, Miss Pettigrew learns that Delysia isn't looking for a governess but a social secretary because they are fashionable.<br /><br />And Delysia definitely needs help sorting out her life.  She's a singer who wants to become an actress.  But she's having huge man problems.  Specifically, there are three men in her life.  There's Phil (Tom Payne), who she has slept with to gain the lead in the play he is producing.  There's Nick (Mark Strong), who owns the nightclub where Delysia sings every night as well as the apartment where Delysia lives.  Then there's Michael (Lee Pace), a piano player who has proposed to Delysia and has spent the last year in prison waiting for an answer.<br /><br />Miss Pettigrew is definitely out of her element, but she seems to be helping Delysia juggle everything.  Can she keep up and guide Delysia at the same time?<br /><br />Yes, this movie is a predictable romantic comedy.  But the ride is quite enjoyable.  The first half is almost farcical in tone with many laugh out loud moments.  The second half becomes more serious with fewer laughs but many very touching moments.  But by that point you are so invested in everyone's lives you have to stay and see how it turns out.<br /><br />The acting holds things together perfectly with the entire cast balancing the comedy and emotion.  But I've got to praise the two leads.  Frances McDormand's facial expressions provide some of the best laughs in the first half.  And Amy Adams keeps Delysia from being a mindless fluffy character.  Instead, we truly care about her from her very first scene.<br /><br />While this is a mindless comedy, I think its appeal will skew slightly older.  Even with the partial nudity and double meanings, this movie will appeal most to adults and less to the teen and early twenty crowd.<br /><br />I found this romantic comedy fun and charming and think that any adult will feel the same way.fluffy character.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|I really loved this DVD. I am now 28 weeks and I am still doing this workout, although I modified some of the exercises a bit. It is easy to adapt to your pace, fitness level, and stage of pregnancy, and the exercises do not require props like balls, weights, rubber bands etc., which some of the other dvds require. It is also easy to remember, and I have done some of the exercises in the swimming pool :)  Overall I really enjoy it and I think Erin is a great instructor. I have both the Gabrielle Reece workout (which I like) and the Shiva Rea yoga, but this one is the DVD I use and like the most.

There are other songs on the cd that are really bluesy(Crazy for You,DayDreamer)So if your into blues you'll love it! My all time favorite is Melt my Heart to Stone. I can really relate to that! Just keep on singing Adele!

B000Q6GUTI|1.0|\\"The Shooter\\" is a movie obviously intended for 15 y.o. schoolboys and Michael Moore/Oliver Stone aficionados.  It is truly the worst movie that I've seen in some time.  It relies entirely on old Hollywood standbys--fatal wounds that the hero recovers from; car chase scenes; heroes that never miss; bad guys who always miss; sinister government plots; sinister FBI characters etc.<br /><br />It's an Oliver Stone film on crack.  There are echoes of \\"JFK\\" i.e. the three guys on the grassy knoll are buried in Terlingua.  \\"Hey, I've still got the shovel!\\"  There are even echoes of the Ruby Ridge massacre.  Our 'hero' is living way out in the woods.  The FBI shoots his dog.  Man, man, man, really original stuff.<br /><br />The plot is far too complex, far too complex to follow, but, not to worry, the director explains it in the end.  The government killed 400 villagers in Ethiopia so that an oil pipeline could go through [get that, folks, evil oil].  Now we don't quite know why they were killed but apparently it's so other villagers will get the message and just get up and move away.  Logical.  Our hero and his shooter friend, shoot Ethiopian retaliation forces but of this I was never clear.  Maybe they were they were shooting the bad guys who did the village murders and our hero, in turn, murders them as a cover-up.  Not to worry.  Our hero doesn't know who he's shooting, either, and, the government, rather than extract or heroes, shoots them up with a helicopter and his friend is killed.  Of course, as we are watching all this we have no clue as to what's happening...we have to wade through hours and hours of this turkey dreck hoping that maybe somebody will make sense of it.  Truly, they never really do.<br /><br />Our hero, after his return, is intelligently employed to detect a long range sniper trying to kill the President.  It's at an outdoor Presidential review featuring the archbishop of Ethiopia [is there an archbishop of Ethiopia?].  Boom! Goes a shot which we learn later, deliberately misses the President and kills the Ethiopian.  Perfect good sense. Suddenly the cops are shooting our hero--again, we have no way of knowing why.  Despite the fact that the hero is shot through the axillary artery, which would have killed him in minutes, and through the gut, which would have disabled him in hours, and killed him in a day or two, our super-hero soldiers on to kill thousands and thousands of bad guys [make that agents and U.S. soldiers] with rifles, pistols, machine guns, garrots, karote and miscellaneous bombs.<br /><br />Wow!!!  What a guy!  And he does all this while mumbling his lines which adds to the mystery of the whole thing.<br /><br />Now, a word for the writers, directors and producers, if they ever read these things.  Why in H... can't you use just a tad of originality?  Why does it always have to be all this Hollywood BS and tripe?  Are you imbeciles or just younger than 22?  Do you still have problems with acne?  Who are you going to vote for in November?  Yeah, I know, it's just a joke.  The whole stinkin' thing is a joke.  Get your stuff together, boys and girls.  You have nothing to lose but your American Civil Liberties card.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaitemisses the President and kills the Ethiopian.  Perfect good sense.

B000O75VSK|3.0|To be honest I am not at all impressed with this album. As a whole it is not very good. Cry with a smile was good and so was Empty Memories, but after that there was nothing that really struck me as wonderful. I sort of enjoyed Energize Me and Equally Destructive, but when matched up to their albums Invisible Circles and Decipher it just doesn't make the cut. Not to say it's a \\"bad album\\". It is just not up to the standards of After Forever. I would go after the two albums aforementioned before getting this one.

031606792X|5.0|I'm a 60 year old woman - not the typical reader of these books, I'm sure.  I read a lot of books of all kinds each year.  My daughter-in-law introduced me to this series, and I started reading them, not expecting to like them.  I mean really, a teenage/vampire love story???  Wow, was I wrong!  These books (all four) have been so fun, enjoyable, addicting - everything you could want from a light read.  Have all of you who are upset by the happy ending, never really had a time in your life when you had it all?  Isn't everyone's real life actually spent hoping for, chasing after, and believing in the happy ending?  Read the books, relax and go with the story, and have a really great time!
B000FC11A6|5.0|Took a while to get into but soon couldn't put it down.  Loved this book. Had some very memorable and humorous scenes.
031606792X|4.0|Like the other books in the series, this book is captivating.  Stephanie does a good job in keeping the attention of her audience. It a good clean book, with a few exceptions of some swear words. Relationships remain clean, integrity is high, sacrifices for loved ones are strong, and in the end, everyone wins.  I like that.
0316067601|2.0|Despite what some reviews claimed, this is not a book comparable to Black Hawk Down. The story is mainly a low brow action story.  Granted, the story is true but the manner in which it is presented to the reader is no where near the caliber of Black Hawk Down and is less than what it could have been.  As a former \\"operator\\" I expected more from Luttrell.  The book was wrought with bravado and self aggrandizing, egocentric references.  SF operators are known for their modesty when speaking of themselves and I found Luttrell's constant self appreciating comments took away from the great story this could have been.  I learned little about Luttrell's fallen teammates and more than I needed to know about Luttrell.  Luttrell did not have to keep reminding the readers how tough he was, he's a SEAL and that says it all, but he harped on it.  Maybe this was the co-author's doing.  In addition, maybe he should have kept his political views to himself.  Granted, when one writes a book it can be a great soap box but one's views may not necessarily mirror those of one's teammates or their grieving families.  Ultimately, one does not fight for the President or a political view, one fights for the men next to him.  To bring politics into the picture and blame the \\"liberal media\\" for covert tactical decisions made in the field is way off beam.  The difficult decisions made during covert operations are often made in the absence of command staff and are more often guided by a moral compass and training, enough said.  Overall, I'd pass on buying the book unless a portion of the proceeds were going to the families of the lost team members. Let me close by saying I wish nothing but the best for PO Luttrell and pray for his lost teammates and their loved ones.  They are all American Heroes and they will remain in my prayers.

B00168ML1G|5.0|Like any movie, some like it and some do not.  I thought it was the best comic book movie yet and I read a gazilion comics growing up in the 60's.  Man I wish my Mom had not chunked all the comics that would be worth thousands now.  Oh well this movie did not try to put all the artsie fartsie stuff like the first Hulk and the third and embarressing Spiderman did.  Downey was excellent and looks perfect in the part.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|Now my feelings are quite different towards the first Hellboy film. I have to admit that although it did have its moments, I found myself becoming bored during the movie. The action sequences were the only relief I felt as when we entered into the emotion sequences I simply found my mind drifting. Guillermo Del Toro's work was completely alien to me until the first Hellboy, now although I did enjoy the original I didn't have many high hopes for the sequel. I guess when he entered into the Hellboy 2 project, Del Toro sought to give us a more fast paced, action packed flick that can keep you hooked from the beginning.<br /><br />In this movie life is great for Big Red (Ron Perlman), he's now in what some would call a perfect relationship with Liz (Selma Blair), he has a lot of cats and is just enjoying life. Unfortunately the happiness isn't going to last very long as in the dark supernatural underworld, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) is planning to rise the indestructible Golden Army once again to destroy the human world. His sister who he's linked to by life doesn't agree with his plans and tries to stop the prince reforming the golden crown which would give him ultimate power over the army. She seeks the help of Big Red and the B.P.R.D.<br /><br />At an increased budget of $80 Million it's obvious from the start that Hellboy 2 is looking to use that budget well. Along with the introduction of a new boss Johann Krauss (Seth Macfarlane), this instalment seeks to introduce a plethora of new fantasy creature. The \\"Tooth Fairies\\" are especially bizarre and in a way frightening at their frantic carnivorous nature. A scene that takes place in troll market is especially wonderful with the number of different species going about their daily lives as if in a normal street market.<br /><br />Along the lines of the insanity of new creatures and sheer bizarre nature of some of them, we also see the return of the classic comic one liners. One of my favourite lines in the movie was so simple, yet so effective. A human yells \\"Hey, you're Hellboy\\" and right back he says \\"Yeah Yeah I'm Ugly\\". To some this may just seem like a witty one liner just for the sake of humour, but it shows how Hellboy is becoming tired of the public admiration and no longer wants a part of it. He also has the talent of coming out with great lines during the action sequences which make them even more enjoyable.<br /><br />Talking about the action sequences, there are plenty to really entertain in this film. The fights involving Prince Nuada are especially enjoyable as they're simply so fast paced that you can hardly keep up. The CGI is flawless and blends well with both characters and environment. Along with the action and humour we are still given the heart of the old movie. We see the relationship between Hellboy and Liz develop into something more serious and Abe Sapien also finds what he would possibly consider his true love. To see them personal relationships blend along with the professional relationships involving the new boss, Krauss. All of the above come together to create an enjoyable 2 hour movie experience that, even if you weren't a fan of the first movie, it's a promise that you will enjoy this instalment. I can only hope that a third movie will be made and possibly on a bigger budget as, although I hate to say it. With this movie series, it seems a bigger budget has meant a much better movie..

0743290119|2.0|After reading and loving Weisberger's first two novels, I had very high hopes for this one and boy, was I disappointed.  I'm still looking for some meaning to the title in regards to the story, but at the same time, I really don't care.  The plot was utterly predictable, but what bothered me more was the fact that I was counting down the pages until the ending rather than worrying if any of the characters would succeed or fail.  Read this if you haven't read Weisberger's other novels, but if you have, you may just want to wait for the next one.<br /><br />Keep trying, Lauren!  I have faith in you.

B0017MO10U|5.0|This DVD is a must have for any SG-1 fan. It adds a bit more to the end of the show and manages to tie down a loose end or two. It's fully recommended.
6304712944|5.0|This is a wonderful film, I also have the stage version.  they are both good, But I remember the film when it first came out and it is still my favorite. I was great to see Richard Harris when he was younger then when he was older in the same role. Reccomend both versions.
B000J103WK|5.0|The overall video quality for this HD-DVD is quite good. There are a few spots that are a little soft but they don't detract from the experience. The 5.1 soundtrack is also impressive. The performance is pretty much flawless. The Eagles are rich in vocal ability and it shows. All 4 of the main-stays, Henley, Frey, Walsh, and Schmidt are bonifide lead singers in their own right. Together, they are very impressive. Their instrumental abilities also do not disappoint. Walsh is an accomplished guitar player. Schmidt is an excellent bass player, very under-rated. Henley is a very able and steady drummer. Frey is a good rhythm guitar player. Henley frequently switches to guitar, but seems to use it as a prop as much as acually playing it. Frey switches to keyboards and though not fancy, does a fine job. With their supporting cast of talented players, it hardly matters anyway. Bottom line, they switch because they feel like it, not because thay have to. Sadly, many famous groups/bands really can't sing or play very well at all. The Eagles are the real deal. Unfortunately, the music business is just that, a business. Too often, talent takes a back seat to market-a-bility. I always enjoy hearing The Eagles many group and individual hits again. Great songs are always great. I also own their \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" DVD, which is also quite good. But this one looks better, sounds better, and has more songs. A+ in every way. Highly Recommended.

B0007PALZ2|4.0|I initially didn't want to watch this film, I'd heard things from other people, who'd found it quite difficult to follow, and yes, that did put me off. But after some persuasion (and the fact I always make my Dad watch my movies, and I rarely watch his), I decided to give it a go.<br /><br />I did find that I really got into watching Twelve Monkeys, including working out stuff that my Dad hadn't worked out when he first saw it. (The first shot of the young boys eyes was so obviously Cole's character younger - but I worked it out cos it's a hideous clich&eacute;, that's always used.) I also noticed that the passage from The Book Of The Revelation is quoted twice, referring to seven golden vials filled with God's wrath. Kathryn says it in her lecture, and then the homeless guy also repeats it.<br /><br />The story starts off in the future - the viewer is never given a set year, although it's mentioned that 1% of the population survived by the year 2035. So possibly, the viewers are left to make up their own minds that it could possibly be sometime after this. An unknown, lethal virus has wiped out five billion people in 1996. The survivors now live underground, and a convict called James Cole (Bruce Willis) reluctantly volunteers to be sent back tin time to 1996 to gather information about the source of the epidemic so scientists can study it. Mistakenly, Cole is sent back to 1990, where he is promptly locked up in a mental institution, and he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who is also in the mental institution. He needs to find a group of people, calling themselves The Twelve Monkeys, who could possibly be releasing the virus in different cities. He also recurring dreams, which feature intermittantly throughout the movie, showing the viewer a bit more each time. What's really happening?<br /><br />I found it incredibly difficult to watch Brad Pitt in this movie. His acting is incredible, but I just couldn't handle watching him. Apparently, to get him to act the way he did, he inititally sent him to a speech coach, and then took away his cigarettes. Very strange. And what was with the eyes? I didn't really notice them (I was focusing on something else), until it was pointed out, and then they gave me shivers up my spine. Yes, his acting is brilliant, the way he managed to do, but I really struggled with watching him, and a couple of times, had to look away from the screen.<br /><br />The 'romance' between James & Kathryn didn't ring true for me. It happens all of a sudden - considering she hated him to begin with - and just seems totally unbelievable.<br /><br />The different things that are explored in the movie, really got my brain buzzing, and I found it difficult to switch off after watching it - but I was still thinking about Brad's character too. Time travel is heavily the focus of the movie, and it's paradoxes - James kept seeing things in the future and the past, and I couldn't work out whether he was projecting these images or what. It also touches upon the subject of mental illness, reality, animal rights, and the technological advances which could bring about the end of the world.<br /><br />There's always different things to watch out for during the movie, and I never found myself bored at any point, despite the running time of two hours. I did end up working out the ending, but thankfully not too soon. Cos that just would have been disappointing!<br /><br />I really did enjoy watching this film, although needed something a bit light hearted to watch after it. The standout thing for me was Brad Pitt. I definitely came away from the film, thinking about his performance. And for the girls, we get to see Bruce Willis naked! From behind! A highlight of the movie.act the way he did, he inititally sent him to a speech coach, and then took away his cigarettes. Very strange. And what was with the eyes? I didn't really notice them (I was focusing on something else), until it was pointed out, and then they gave me shivers up my spine. Yes, his acting is brilliant, the way he managed to do, but I really struggled with watching him, and a couple of times, had to look away from the screen.    The 'romance' between James & Kathryn didn't ring true for me. It happens all of a sudden - considering she hated him to begin with - and just seems totally unbelievable.     The different things that are explored in the movie, really got my brain buzzing, and I found it difficult to switch off after watching it - but I was still thinking about Brad's character too. Time travel is heavily the focus of the movie, and it's paradoxes - James kept seeing things in the future and the past, and I couldn't work out whether he was projecting these images or what. It also touches upon the subject of mental illness, reality, animal rights, and the technological advances which could bring about the end of the world.    There's always different things to watch out for during the movie, and I never found myself bored at any point, despite the running time of two hours. I did end up working out the ending, but thankfully not too soon. Cos that just would have been disappointing!    I really did enjoy watching this film, although needed something a bit light hearted to watch after it. The standout thing for me was Brad Pitt. I definitely came away from the film, thinking about his performance. And for the girls, we get to see Bruce Willis naked! From behind! A highlight of the movie.
0374531269|1.0|I have no doubt that Beah experienced things that I can't imagine and that no child should see, but he writes it poorly.  I am all for stories, which is why I read, but think they need to be told well.  A given medium needs to be done properly to be most effective.  Beah does it poorly.  I'd give his book a D.  He tells his story so badly that the reader has no idea the point, plot, relevance, or validity of the story.  In no way do I want to make light of what he experienced, but he did it so poorly that he did a disservice to all books.  This was a waste of the paper it was printed on.
9562911640|5.0|In the introductory biography which precedes Haanel's work, the publishers highlight at least one reason why you might want to read this book:     \\"It is Silicon Valley's secret that almost every entrepreneur who made a fortune in recent years did so by studying the words Mr Haanel penned over eighty years ago....Since this book was no longer in print until recently, copies of The Master Key System became a hot commodity in the Valley\\".     Now I've no way of knowing if this statement is true, but such is the power of Haanel's system that it seems eminently plausible. I would not for a moment want anyone to think that Haanel presents some kind of 'cosmic ordering'-type, 'get-rich-quick' system, and neither is it a book about Law of Attraction. It is far deeper, and more important, than that. Haanel claims that his system can revolutionise your life. I've been working with this kind of system for years, and am emphatically convinced that it works.     At the heart of Haanel's approach is an analytical thesis that was pioneered by Thomas Troward (to whom Haanel refers in this book). Essentially, this thesis is that the universe is governed by an overarching creative process.     Haanel calls this \\"Universal Consciousness\\"; Troward called it \\"Spirit\\". Neither refers to \\"God\\", because the Universal Mind that they describe is an essentially impersonal, 'subjective' force, equivalent to the subconscious rather than the conscious in the human mind. It is more akin to a highest law of nature - a law of creativity - than to a deity. It is impersonal. You do not worship it, but you align your approach with it. Haanel's term \\"Universal Consciousness\\" is probably more apt than Troward's \\"Spirit\\" because the latter might carry connotations of the occult (though that was certainly not what Troward meant).     Haanel argues that everyone's subconscious is a part of the Universal Consciousness. This gives the individual access to great creative power, in any aspect of life. Anything that manifests in your external world, Haanel argues, has been manifested first in the inner world of your mind. The trick, therefore, is to learn how to discipline your inner world - in other words, to channel your thinking - so that inner creation is positive.     His method, originally published as a part-work, is to set out twenty-four stages of study, each including a mental exercise. Each chapter contains a list of numbered, very precise propositions. This is a very effective, very focused approach.     If you are sceptical about the idea of a universal creative process - and do not believe that thought drives the material - you are not going to like The Master Key System. But if you accept a Troward/Haanel-type analysis of cause and effect, you will find The Master Key System an extremely powerful and effective tool.
B000VS6P9Q|4.0|This soundtrack to [[ASIN:B0013D8L7C I'm Not There]] is absolutely packed with music, featuring two CDs that are each 80 minutes long.  I don't recall hearing many of these recordings in the movie itself, but that's not uncommon for a soundtrack these days.  The songs were all written by Bob Dylan, as you are probably already aware.  Most of these cover songs are quite good, although some are better than others.  Of course, it's all a matter of personal preference, my favorites may be different from your favorites.  Fittingly, Dylan himself gets the final word, with the previously unreleased title song (it was recorded at [[ASIN:B000002552 The Basement Tapes sessions]]).  This is a fine collection of Dylan songs.
B000059H98|3.0|I have to admit I'm shocked and a little appalled that this film doesn't get more recognition than it deserves. It's based around the comic character of the same name, the comic design was based around the punk era look and many will recognise that the art and stories are particularly anarchic and totally absurd. Unlike many other comic book to film adaptations, Tank Girl keeps true to its comic roots, if only to fade away to tone down the sex a bit. During the course of the film, it tries to keep so close to the comic feel that some scenes are blended together through the comic type art. Although it did try to keep to the same chaotic style of the popular comic, the movie ultimately bombed at the Box Office, with many people simply saying it wore them out.<br /><br />There's no doubting the films unlimited amount of energy and bucket full of comic wit and charm. I'm not very familiar with the work of Lori Petty so I can't exactly compare her role as Tank Girl to any of her other work, the only thing I can say is that she was awesome in the role.<br /><br />The settings aren't anything to write home about, but that's not a problem as it's not really a film that requires any large and detailed environments. It doesn't try to be big budget, it's merely a movie that gives you what you need in order to follow the plot and the characters, no matter how real or surreal they may be.<br /><br />Set in a dystopian 2033, an asteroid had collided with Earth and it hasn't rained for 11 years. A company called Water & Power lead by the dictatorial Kesslee, seeks to take control of the worlds water supply. Whilst taking over the last known water area, he crosses and kills the boyfriend of Tank Girl, kidnaps his daughter and herself. While in captivity Kesslee tortures Tank Girl in an attempt to try and break her, but she constantly barrages him with insults which only make things worse. Tank Girl manages to escape her initial captivity with the help of Jet Girl (Naomi Watts) but realises she needs to save her boyfriends daughter, Sam and to take down Water & Power. In order to do so she must employ the help of the most feared creatures in the land, The Rippers.<br /><br />The film is even more bizarre than it initially sounds as, at times it does seem all over the place and at times quite confusing. Although the overall viewing experience can be a bit exhaustive, there's no doubting that it's a definite worthwhile experience.<br /><br />I personally found that the character of Kesslee played by Malcolm McDowell simply wasn't as intimidating as I found myself wanting him to be. I wanted him to be haunting and at the same time, seem genuinely evil, as it's certainly the type of character the film makers were after. Honestly the only characters that really did work were both Tank & Jet girl, their chemistry really worked when confronting the relationship between the timid Jet Girl and the open and confident Tank Girl. If it weren't for these two I would find myself completely trashing this film, but I couldn't bring myself to do it as Lori Petty simply did a superb job.ave her boyfriends daughter, Sam and to take down Water & Power.

B000V86OKG|4.0|The first season seemed more accurate when it came to him possibly having Anti-Social Personality Disorder. I have a feeling the producers felt a need to make him 'more human' in regards to his relationships, but it felt unrealistic. Other than that, it was entertaining, and dramatic as usual.  I did find myself missing the way the first season was laid out, the redundancy, the flow.

B00030590I|5.0|Hero genuinely impressed me, much to my surprise - I'm not a fan of the humourlessly one-note Jet Li, who has always struck me as a character from Mystery Men who didn't make the final cut (useless `super' power - the ability to wave a flagpole around very, very fast) and after all the fuss made over the tedious, overlong and undernourished Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was expecting the Western critical praise to translate into another tired and overfamiliar movie that appealed mainly to people who hadn't seen much Eastern cinema. Boy, was I wrong. A gorgeous looking epic with a real sense of scale and amazing visuals allied to a complex plot, I was kicking myself for not seeing this one on the big screen. Not everything is successful (the duel on the lake never quite works), but more than enough is to guarantee repeat viewings. Li's limitations are used well for once and while Ziyi Zhang's petulant acting still doesn't entirely convince me, it's surprising to find the weakest performance coming from the film's best actor, Tony Leung Chiu Wai. Never at his most convincing in fantasy swordplay movies (the introspective Ashes of Time excepted), he seems a little underpowered for such an iconic role. But these are minor quibbles with a major delight.     Be aware that there is an extended director's cut available in China (the disc has English subtitles though there is a curious intermittent trademark watermark in the top of the screen), although Miramax seem in no hurry to release it here.

B000T9OP7G|5.0|I'm starting to think that this may become my favorite TV series of all time. I haven't seen a TV series this exciting since Firefly! It truly is amazing and you will love this series if you are a fan of the Terminator. Each episode is masterfully written and fits into the mythology of the series. It has been a long time since I have seen a TV series where every episode is just as good as the last. The actors really do have chemistry on screen and the show just works. I just hope that this doesn't get cancelled because I could keep watching this for a long time.

031606792X|5.0|First Off, this is the most amazing story ever.  For all you slamming this book, you need to get a real good grip on reality here.  This is a work of fiction.  I certainly hope no girl is putting hopes into anything to do with a fictional story on Vampires and other supernatural beings...Puhlease!    The story is fast paced and interesting from the start to the finish.  Some of the reviews were so poorly stated that it truely ruined this story for many people like my co-worker.  I am so greatful that I didn't listen to the earlier reviews.    There was nothing in this book that was creepy or odd in any way.  Again, it is a book of fiction. There was nothing in this book that a teenager couldn't read. It all depends on how sheltered you raise your child.  If the child is sheltered where their not allowed to watch tv, then they shouldn't have been reading this series to begin with.  There is way more going on in the real world to be worried about than a fantasy romance novel with a twist of imagination.    I truely loved this book stephanie.  Thanks for a work of passion and creativity.

0099429799|5.0|Stunning, simply stunning. I finished this book coming home on an airplane and I forgot where I was for a few hours while reading it -- which was nice because I absolutely hate flying any more. I won't rehash the plot here (it's widely discussed and there are many websites that also discuss the novel), but I will say that the writing was superb.     I loved the ending (I won't go into that either), and didn't even see it coming. I started flipping backwards, and as I realized what McEwan did there, I was even more impressed with what I'd just read. It was definitely one of those endings you don't forget easily, and one that sneaks up on you.    I'd recommend it to anyone who loves a good work of literature and who wants something a wee bit different. McEwan never fails to amaze me with every book I read, and this one was no different. No wonder the man has been nominated for so many literary awards.  The story itself is very well done, the characters are all exquisitely drawn and the ending sort of hits you like a ton of bricks. Very highly recommended; going on my list of personal favorites for 2008.  postscript: the movie was quite good and remarkably true to the novel.

B0018RWMNM|5.0|I know that it has been said by thousands of folks but lets say it one more time. Lonesome Dove is without a doubt the greatest movie ever made. EVER. Robert Duvall as, no make that Robert Duvall is Gus McCrae and Tommy Lee Jones is Captain Woodrow F. Call. They embark on a 2500 mile cattle drive from Texas to Montana to set up ranch and be cattlemen. Gus is the kind that likes to play cards and get pokes and Call is all about business. They were Texas Rangers together in the old days and have a friendship that we all wish we could have. Along with Jake Spoon, Deets, Newt, Dish and the very underrated Tim Scott as Pea Eye they go and re steal horses from the Mexicans and then head on their way to Montana. Gus is not thrilled about going but is on the trip for only one reason and that is to go and see his long lost love Clara Allen. Along the way you are introduced to the Indian outlaw Blue Duck, who has alluded Call and McCrae from their days as rangers, Sheriff July Johnson and his deputy Rosco along with other great characters. Every actor or actress who played in Lonesome Dove seems custom made for the part they play. In this movie you have some of the best supporting roles in movie history. You have Diane Lane as Lorie, Barry Tubb as Jasper Fant, Leon Singer as Bolivar the cook from Lonesome Dove, D.B. Sweeney, in one of the best character developments, as Dish Boggett, Rick Schroeder as Calls unclaimed son Newt and many others who are just as important to the story but just to many to name. I really don't have the time and space to tell you about all the great things about this movie so you will need to set aside 6 hours and sit back and enjoy the greatest movie ever made. Now onto the Blu-Ray disc. The movie was CROPPED to make it widescreen. There was a lot more taken off of the top and bottom then was gained on the sides. However the picture quality is outstanding compared to my old DVD. The extras on this disc are also way better than the original DVD. Overall a 5/5 movie and a 4/5 Blu-Ray.

B000W74EQC|5.0|For a lot of reasons, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is probably a tempting movie to criticize. After all, there is almost nothing a critic hates more than a film that is practically - baring some unforgivable act of gross incompetence - a guaranteed success, despite anything he or she might happen to write about it.              At any rate, while some may quibble with the notion that Sorcerer's Stone is too much like the book that inspired it, the upside for moviegoers is that neither Rowling nor director Christopher Columbus have forgotten the film's primary audience: young readers between the ages of 12 - 16. For those whose parents read the book to them, the age may actually drop a bit below that.               For the most part, as every parent knows, it is an audience frequently patronized with the worst sort of infantile pap imaginable, sometimes inundated with coarse language and gratuitous violence, or simply ignored altogether. Columbus, to his credit, does none of the above. In remaining true to his audience, Columbus has, in fact, delivered a film for all of us.              It is obvious Columbus knows, for instance, that a young audience wants to see on the screen what it read in the book. In pursuit of this goal, Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves have fashioned characters and settings true to the letter and the spirit of the novel. The characters, especially, strike just the right chord of familiarity. Certainly, we all know that familiarity can wander over the line into disinterested comfort. Remarkably, the characters in Sorcerer's Stone never do. Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid, for instance, looks just as we expect him to. More important, he radiates a warmth and trust that serves as a secure anchor in those moments when events seem to be spinning out of control. As good as Hagrid is in the book, Coltrane's Hagrid is more vivid on the screen.              Which brings us to the performance of Daniel Radcliffe in the role of Harry Potter. At first glance, Radcliffe seems reticent and withdrawn, hidden behind a gauze curtain, an uncertain hero. Yet we cannot forget that Harry Potter is an eleven year-old orphan whose parents have been murdered. He is a foundling whose caretakers resent his existence and actively disapprove of everything he is and, worse, in their own eyes, everything he will become. He is forced to sleep in a closet under the stairs and absorb a constant stream of verbal and physical abuse from his malevolent aunt and uncle and their overindulged son, Dudley.               Yes, of course Harry is withdrawn. Small wonder. Or, as my daughter would say, \\"Duh!\\"               In fact, Radcliffe's performance is entirely consistent with Harry's history and upbringing, and Columbus has wisely ensured that, as the chronicle of films progresses, the character of Harry has somewhere to go. There are, after all, six movies still to come. Columbus has clearly determined that, unlike some other celluloid heroes of recent memory (Indiana Jones springs to mind), the character of Harry Potter should have some room to develop, otherwise both the young wizard and his friends would grow quickly stagnant.              Another notable attribute of the film is that the atmosphere and setting, through the more subtle elements of special effects, are beautifully realized. As the first-years are journeying across the lake, their - and our - first view of Hogwarts Castle is absolutely breathtaking, a spectacular, gothic memory from a medieval dream. Inside the castle are stairways that move, pictures that talk and go about their daily routines, and a splendid dining hall that evokes the grandeur of a cathedral. When the Sorting Hat pronounces \\"GRIFFINDORE\\" on this opulent stage, Harry's adventures officially begin.              Yes, the adventure has its obvious, special effects masterpieces. The Quidditch match is a high-flying, fast-paced extravaganza of soccer, polo, and basketball on broomsticks. The chess match is the high point of the film. At the same time, there are special effects so well done that they don't draw attention to themselves. The messenger owls flying gracefully into the dining hall to deliver envelopes and parcels is a brief, finely structured, aerial ballet that is easy to take for granted because we are momentarily suspended in the world of Hogwarts and have willingly cast aside our powers of disbelief. When Hedwig flies above Hogwarts Castle, our spirits and our sense of wonder soar with him. It is an impressive accomplishment.               Because it is true to itself and never panders to its audience, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is both exciting and entertaining, an escape to a world where magical things can still happen. It is, in short, a film for the child in all of us.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater with my granddaughter. We were both enthralled with the story and the excellent animation. I feel it will become a staple for the season and a classic on a par with Wizard of Oz.  I had to have it in my movie collection.
B0018AK9RA|1.0|This album is pathetic. I wanted more metal from the metal band Judas Priest. Why would they release this as a Judas Priest album? They could have called it Nostradamus Disciples or something. Then no one would have expected it to sound like Judas Priest. I only like about 5 songs on this album and almost every other Judas Priest song is better than the ones I like. I guess if you only listen to them because you love Rob Halford's singing then it would be fine but I hate it because it is not a metal album. This is worse than \\"Risk\\" by Megadeth. The lyrics don't even go into Nostradamus'predictions or anything like that. They're very vague.
B0019M06JS|5.0|The music of Eliane Elias is deeply harmonic and sensual. At its heart is utterly superb jazz piano - rhythmic, gently propulsive and essentially (though not overtly) Brazilian. Elias infuses her sonorous, vibrant playing with some pleasingly melodic, whispery-delicate vocals - always pitch-perfectly complementing her sumptuous piano verve.     'Bossa Nova Stories' combines loving interpretations of Brazilian jazz classics with some popular American standards, all quality-assured by the formidable rhythm section of top-level bassist Marc Johnson (her husband) and percussionist Paulo Braga. About half the tracks are enriched by subtle orchestral arrangements conducted by Rob Mathes - reminiscent to me of those that embellish Diana Krall's 'The Look of Love'.     'Bossa Nova Stories' is essential listening to all who like, or certainly who love, Brazilian jazz. Track no 6, 'Estate (Summer'), can only be described as sublime - one of the most exquisite of jazz-samba melodies taken assuredly by Elias to a new level with the help of Toot Thieleman's passionate, playful harmonica. Further album standouts include 'Girl from Ipanema', 'Desafinado', 'Superwoman' and 'Rã (The Frog)'.     The album may not be as accomplished in jazz terms as the powerful 'Paulistana' or as innovative as the highly recommended 'Kissed by Nature', which comprises some wonderful Elias originals. Yet as an uplifting virtuoso homage to Brazilian jazz, 'Bossa Nova Stories' is a wise investment in complete musical enjoyment.
031606792X|4.0|this last stephanie meyer book was good! there seemed to be alot of information and it keeps me on the edge of my seat and wanting to read more. the book seemed to go on forever with bella being pregnant that i was impatient to get to the part where she had the kid. overall its  a good book. i like the first three better though
B00005JNJV|2.0|BatMan Begins was a good summer movie no doubt. The Story was deep, the quality is good everything was good, especially if your a batman fan. The only complaint I really have to stress out is the fight scene. The \\"fight scenes\\"(not to be misunderstood with \\"action scenes\\" car chase,explosions, ect.)In comparison with the 1989 Batman the fight scenes were clean, and understandable(that i mean u can actually understand what batman did to his enemy and vice versa). Batman Begins fight scenes were absoulutely horrible!. All mention above between the 1989 version were complete opposite.          Don't get me wrong i love batman im a batman fan i loved the story in \\"Begins\\" and the quality is nothing less than awsome. I simply can't stand the shaky camera, bad camera angles,you cannot understand what batman is doing to the enemy in close quarter combat(vice versa). I know alot of people are going to critisize me or probably totally disagree with me, or even say that \\"fight sequence\\" does not play an important role in story.          C'mon It's BATMAN! I mean if batman fight scenes are going to be long as it is in \\"Begins\\" or emphasized that Batman knows some kind of martial art skill in close quarter combat it should be \\"clean\\" and executed Clearly. Going back to the 1989 movie, the fight scenes were kinda short but explosive and it surely shows what batman can do with the baddies. Batman Begins...fight scenes too long, horrid shaky camera(just like \\"daredevil\\") was enough to rate \\"Begins\\" 2 stars cuz believe me.. once you understand and compare the difference you will end up fast forwarding the fight scenes like a bad repetitive porn movie. Im glad to see that \\"The Dark Knight\\" the fight scenes were better but still not the best compared to the 1989 batman. In \\"the dark knight\\" batman is not \\"flashy\\"(that i mean no simplistic explosive kicks or ducking and countering attacks) it was just one two hits and the baddies go down. better than \\"begins\\" but not asgood as 1989. RIP Bruce LEE You standardized fight scenes in movies that america still needs to understand, Good JOB to the fight director for 1989 You definately did your homework...Batman doing streetfight lunging powerful backkicks and doing incredible jeet kune do \\"intercepting\\" attacks to a sword swinging crazy head? wow!! at least batman1989 will be in batman history books for memorable incredible fight scenes.

B0014I4KIK|2.0|A bit disappointed.  After the rave reviews in TIME and other sources, and having Winehouse's latest CD as a benchmark, I myself not a big CD buyer anymore risked the purchase only to be disappointed in the end.  She can sing, but does not have the spunk or sass of Winehouse nor her soul.  Duffy however makes a very picturesque retro album cover.  The kind of face you wish Winehouse would have.    JP
072325804X|5.0|This is a lovely book that comes in a sturdy, decorative, open-eneded box to protect the volume. Besides containing all of Beatrix Potter's wonderful children's stories, it has all of the original illustrations in one volume. This is the perfect \\"bedtime story\\" book, and it sits on the nightstand next to my 11-old-granddaughter's bed. She reads the stories to her 3-year-old sister every night, and is planning on continuing the tradition with her 1-year-old brother. She told me that she is enjoying the stories as much as her little sister!    I purchased this book as a gift for their family, and, as a proud grandmother, I can't think of anything that costs so little and yet gives so much. I would recommend this book for anyone! I am going to purchase another copy for my own house, just in case I have guests who show up with little ones. It's a perfect addition to anyone's library, and I highly recommend it.
B00003CXB4|1.0|When I purchased this dvd I paid for a NEW movie and was under the empression that was what I would be getting, Instead what I received was a burned copy that was not sealed, even the cover and book inside were copies, The movie wont play the dvd player has a message that the disk is dirty.My child was and still is upset due to the fact that the movie wont play. I'm very disappointed and upset that people can and do take advantage of people.
031606792X|5.0|from all the low scoring by fans of Stephenie Meyer about how the Breaking Dawn send out a wrong message, I'm quiet disappointed. But curious to what do these people expect? it's a fiction work, it's anything but reality. If Meyer want to write a story with a moral, she would have already, why bother with a fiction story about vampire and werewolf; the point of fictions is to let the reader loss away from the reality world and entering an illustrated world. Yet still I have to admit that the stories plot was not as best as it should be, but no less than the first book, keeping me in a constant reading mood; I like the honeymoon the baby, and the new Bella.
031606792X|5.0|All this negative feedback is really depressing so I thought I would put in my own two-cents worth. (SPOILER ALERT) I don't see what all the complaining is about.  Sure, it's not as good as the first novel - but are sequels ever as good.  Why does everybody have such a problem with Bella and Edward living happily ever after?  I understand and agree that when a main character dies at the end, it makes for a powerful ending, but seriously, how can you want Bella and Edward to die.  Isn't it nice to know that they will have 'forever' together?  I think Stephenie Meyer did a fine job and I am excitedly awaiting the Twilight movie and Midnight Sun!!
B000001ESF|5.0|I was driving home from a friends house and listened to this CD that I had stuck in my console. I remember purchasing 2112 on a whim, as an LP, in 1977( freshman year in high school). I played this over and over and made a cassette recording to play in the under dash player I had mounted in my dad's car. It brought back ALOT of memories of fun times and innocence, a time when there were no cell phones, internet, computers,CD's, high def. etc. Going to second base in the back seat of your dad's car was exciting and dangerous, hiding beers in the woods and lying about whose house you were sleepng at. This was truly played over and over and over, whether it was at a friends house on the turn-table singing along and trying to match Geddy's high notes or copied to a cassette recording handed from one friend to another. If you enjoyed this album in the past... its well worth breaking out again.. :)    Thank you Geddy, Alex and Neil for GREAT music !!
031606792X|5.0|I really wanted to finish the series but was not looking forward to reading the last book because of all the customer reviews that were so negative.  I'm glad I forged ahead and read \\"Breaking Dawn\\".  I really liked it.  For me, it was a page-turner that I didn't mind reading into the wee hours.  I didn't think of it as more than an author telling a story they'd created.  I didn't see it as a \\"how-to\\" on being a vampire/werewolf/anything.  I was delighted by the creative thinking of Ms. Meyers (one unexpected event after another).  I didn't see any undertones of religion.  I didn't see anything that made me think of pedophilia.  I liked the book and I liked the series.  Take heart, Ms. Meyers.  The moms around the swimming pool and my colleagues at school thought it was a great read; I did, too.  I think I'll start re-reading the series when Christmas Break comes around!
031606792X|3.0|While it was entertaining, I don't find the book as well balanced and intriguing as the previous two had been.<br /><br />There was WAY too much exposition to be the last book. It just didn't make any sense. I could've done completely w/o Jacob's book and had all that told more efficiently through Edward. Although, I really enjoy Jacob's p.o.v. there was just way too much time spent on that....and for what? I don't think I needed THAT much Jacob...the imprinting scene was nice, though. Also, about Bella's feelings-they just totally evaporated? I don't think so! I'm totally team Edward and even I was bit jealous about Jacob & Nessie!<br /><br />The birth scene was gruesome! But it was so supposed to be. It was very excellently done.<br /><br />I was also upset at Bella being pregnant. I felt as if the rules where breaking. I was so sure that was not going to happen. I felt it was a cheap plot twist, BUT that was before I saw how much Nessie would drive it. In the end, not only did I like Nessie as a character, but the idea of her as well.<br /><br />I really felt like the Volturi and the alliance of all the other vamps should've been more of the story. Also, there were some other vamps who had powers that we didn't even hear about! Por que?! A bit more of an actual fight would've been nice, but the tension was very well done!<br /><br />I want to know more about Leah. She's all alone now and won't be able to run with Jacob like she thought she might. What's going to happen to her? For me, she is BY FAR the most interesting, complex character. I hope the series continues with her.<br /><br />To me, it seems this book struggled a bit..All of the previous books had much more of visual quality to them, however, this book contained the least amount of that factor (although, when it was there, it was superb). I think it threw the series off balance.<br /><br />Looking back, I still enjoyed the book and cared about the characters. I wondered what would happen next when I was away doing something else. I will surely reread this and I know I'll have a different perspective.<br /><br />As I'm seeing it now...it was in a different speed than the previous 3.<br /><br />I cried when Jacob cried<br />And how much do I love Garrett and Kate? &lt;3<br />New Moon is my favorite book, although I concede that Eclipse was better written.nd I know I'll have a different perspective.

B0019X3YXM|1.0|Maverick/Vertigo originally got high marks for deciding to remake a very popular Korean film of the same name, but the results were less than fantastic. The targeted audience of teen to twenty-somethings was obvious with two castings of the Bring It On actor Jesse Bradford and the popular 24 daughter Elisha Cuthbert.<br /><br />The requests for this one were already pouring in because of the original piece, plus the director from the highly rated Love Me if You Dare made his next film. I'll skip the comparisons between the two films and just try this one on its own merit.<br /><br />The storyline of two young strangers meeting in New York and falling in love appears quite forcefully after a novice storyboard coverage of the main character's early life. Our Cuthbert character plays the strange and mysterious rich girl with a damaged back story we know nothing about. Through the course of their strange meetings, dates or whatever you want to call them, all of the teens watching left the room within 20 minutes. I stuck it out to see if this dysfunctional relationship would become believable. It never really does, and as the love story grew painfully more boring and contrived, the middle-aged ladies gave up watching also.<br /><br />The ending had some heart, but overall the film never materializes into anything enjoyable, believable or rewatchable. The DVD has absolutely nothing extra to it, so between there being no special features whatsoever and a disappointing love story, I had to give it the lower rating.
0142437611|5.0|I read this book several months, and I revisit it in my thoughts weekly.  The character's of this book are not likable.  Consequently, that may be why I found the book so compelling, and thought provoking.  It's a man of failure, and I believe everyone may find one like trait in the protagonist that shakes them to their core.
B00169XU8I|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  It's constantly in my CD player.  The CD is pure jam session from beginning to end.  Anyone who does not like this album is a fool, and has not good taste in music.  Madonna is at her best, back to her dance roots.  As Confessions was the pop dance album, this is her urban dance album.  Great album to follow with a great tour!!!!!
B00188KD1Y|5.0|Although there weren't any points for running over civilians, Frankenstine and more than a half-dozen armor-plated cars made this a fun film.<br /><br />Jason Statham's character is set up for killing his wife and conveniently imprisioned on Terminal Island, where the Death Race takes place. Without spoiling the little bit of plot there is, it should come as no surprise that Jason ends up driving a Mustang that would make Mad Max envious.<br /><br />Men will like this one for the cars and action. Women will go to see the scenes where Jason is in various stage of undress.<br /><br />Check it out!
B00005JPUN|2.0|I gave this a couple of stars just for the production design and some action sequences.  There is nothing else to recommend, as Kidman does some of her worst work and Daniel Craig tries to match that.  The earlier versions of this story were far more effective and certainly were better films too.  The little boy playing Kidman's son was appealing; one hopes he will find a better project later.  This one is dull and pointless.
B000000WJZ|4.0|It's good to hear some more music from the early 90's that was able to escape grunge's tentacles. There are a few elements in there that make it comparable to that genre, but it's really closer to alternative rock that got more popular later on. I feel like the album might be a little longer than it needs to, and some of the songs are a little similar, but nothing in particular felt like it needed to be changed or cut. A lot of the songs sounded similar to stuff that came out later, which points to it being pretty influential to modern rock. A song like \\"Today\\" for example, sounds like something I've heard fifty times before, but might be the first time it was made. Sort of like Nevermind, I respect it more than I liked it, but I did like it it more than that.    I knew \\"Cherub Rock\\" already from a couple music games last year, and it's more enjoyable when you're not playing a plastic instrument and screwing up more than you think you should be. \\"Disarm\\" is another single I've heard before, and sets itself apart from the other tracks with lots of strings and bells creating the atmosphere instead of guitar. It's followed and complemented well by \\"Soma\\", which is a soft, acoustic song that slowly builds to a nice release. \\"Silverf##k\\" isn't a bad song, but I feel like it hurts the flow of the rest of the record. It's quite long and sort of progressive, and while no element is bad, it just bores me a bit before the last couple tracks pull it back in another stylistic switch.  Few moments on the album truly grabbed me, but it was solidly written and performed rock throughout.
015206396X|4.0|Since Harry Potter inspired not only children, but many adults, to read with voracity, a plethora of YA (young adult) series have been swamping the market.  Most of them are either wanna-be Potters, quickly written and published by companies looking for quick sales and big profits by hailing them as the next Harry Potter, and YA books that are really meant for adults.<br /><br />Kristin Cashore's Graceling does not fall into these categories, save for a slightly overdone romance for YA.  It's an engaging read that makes you say, \\"Just one more chapter and I'll put it down,\\" but you don't put it down.<br /><br />The plot and world of Graceling is fairly refreshing and new, and the characters are interesting and real.  To say more would endanger taking away the fun of discovering this book for others.<br /><br />For those like me, who like to pre-screen what your children read recreationally (not that I don't end up enjoying them as well), it's difficult to place an age group for this particular book.  It's for Young Adults and I have a teenage boy who has always read well his age level.  Part of me suspects he is not ready for it, if only because despite his above age reading, he still has limited himself to male protagonistic books.  I'd say that if your child was mature enough to read the Twilight series, this book would be appropriate and enjoyed.
B001B71NOI|5.0|Trent is just genius!  I like how he has gotten more involved with writing lyrics that don't just apply to him personally, but to the World as a whole.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|After finding this, and its sequel, in my collection, much to my surprise because I don't remember owning them or wanting to own them, I decided to re-watch them.<br /><br />To my surprise, I found them more palatable than the first time around, though this one still inferior to the second one.<br /><br />Perhaps it's because I came to the film again with litte or no expectations, as opposed to when I saw it at a sneak preview with huge expectations (despite never playing the game).  It could be that this is literally the first role I saw Daniel Craig in (Road to Perdition being the second).  It amused the hell out of me that American Angelina Jolie used a British accent and British Daniel Craig used an American one (better than Jolie's).<br /><br />There is still more humor and quirkiness in Lara's inherited Butler and beyond quirky boy-Friday who creates all her wonderful toys in addition to computer hacking with ease.  At this point, I can't help but feel that Jolie simply hadn't gotten comfortable with her character as well as she did in the second.<br /><br />Still, she pulls off the high-action skills with grace, emotes well when it comes to her dead father (ironically played by her real father, absent most of Jolie's life and then banished not long after this when he announced to the world he thought she was in serious psychological danger when in fact she was at the point that left Billy Boy and cutting behind and had become a U.N. Goodwill Ambassador and adopted her first child).  Her constant, \\"Hmmm,\\" and head-cock when confronted with something that surprises her even has become less-grating and more endearing now.<br /><br />For those who have seen it and panned it, give it a second go.  For those who haven't, approach it with the thought to not expect too much out of it, and you'll find it can be pretty fun.  As it is, I had to go raise my previous rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|\\"Man on Wire\\" is a new documentary about tightrope walker Phillippe Petite, who decided to string a wire, a strong wire, between the towers of the World Trade Center, just as it was being completed in 1976, and walk across, many hundreds of feet up in the air. Daring? Yes. Crazy? Yes. Beautiful? Yes. Illegal? Yes.<br /><br />Directed by James Marsh, whose last film was the little seen drama \\"The King\\" starring Gael Garcia Bernal, Nick Nolte and Paul Dano, \\"Man on Wire\\" is a fun, riveting and lighthearted look at one man's daring, crazy, beautiful and illegal attempt to create a piece of living art.<br /><br />The story opens with some brief \\"recreations\\" much like you might see on A & E these days. A date pops up and we see it is mid 1974. Young men are loading a van with equipment while a television in the background reports on the breaking Watergate Scandal. Then, a jaunty, accented voice is heard and begins to narrate the story of Philippe Petit. It is, in fact, Petit's voice and he tells us about his childhood in the South of France, and how he talked his friends into helping him build a makeshift high wire. Yes, it was only a few feet off the ground, but it allowed Philippe to practice, and practice and practice. We meet his small circle of friends including the girl who will eventually become his girlfriend.<br /><br />Soon, Phillippe begins to set his sights of bigger challenges and we follow as he and his team of friends decide to set-up a wire on the top of Notre Dame Cathedral, allowing Phillippe to walk back and forth. Everything is timed for this to happen in the early morning, and it comes off like a charm. His girlfriend rushes into the cathedral, during a service and tells the priests that someone is walking between the towers of the church. Soon, a crowd has gathered and Phillippe and his friends talk about the beauty of such a statement. They are making a piece of livable art. Phillippe walks across the wire, towards the middle, slowly, and then takes a break, sitting, reclining on the wire, stretching his legs out, staying perfectly balanced. He almost looks like a ballet dancer, but hundreds of feet up in the air. Then, grainy archival news footage shows us the French police taking Phillippe away in custody.<br /><br />After he is released, with a mild slap on the wrist, a mixture of recent interviews, archival footage and recreations help to give us a picture of how Phillippe got it in his mind to even think about crossing between the towers of the World Trade Center. He sees a story in the newspaper about the new building, how it will be the tallest structure in the world and it will have two towers. We learn through the interviews that Phillippe is attracted to this because of the danger, the fact that no one has ever done it before or since. The excitement plays a huge part in it, but the notoriety he will earn and the creation of living art all play a factor.<br /><br />It is pretty evident from the statements of his accomplices that Phillippe is a persuasive, infectious man. As he talks about the plan, his friends, and what will be required, the director cuts to shots of the people involved, in present day, recapturing them as they recount the details. We frequently see their genuine emotions, shock and amazement as they recount the events of yesterday. These events from thirty years ago are still so powerful, they elicit honest, tangible emotions today as the subjects relate their stories. Because of this power, their emotion wears off on us.<br /><br />Marsh's use of these different forms of media makes this film strikingly similar to some of Errol Morris' best work. The recreations frequently show a subject partially out of frame, deeply out of focus, to help obscure the fact actors are playing real people. Cameras zoom in for close-ups on hands, sides of faces, etc. The camera captures certain things in slow motion. The recreations almost appear to be saturated, in an attempt to match the graininess and age of the archival footage. The new interviews are crisp and well done. All of these various elements are set to a slightly playful musical score (which was also used by Peter Greenaway in \\"The Draughtsman's Contract\\"). While not exclusive to Errol Morris, all of these elements are certainly reminiscent of his work. And when they are combined with a strange, but fitting piece of music, the film is almost a homage to the great documentarian.<br /><br />When Phillippe gets the idea to cross the two towers, he enlists the aid of his friends to help with the planning and execution of the stunt. They also realize they will need the help of some Americans, some inside people, who can help them infiltrate the security of the building.<br /><br />Perhaps the best thing about \\"Man on Wire\\" is that Marsh has constructed the entire story like a bank heist film from the 70s. We start in the middle of the story and work back to the beginning. Then we begin moving forward. The entire plan isn't revealed at the beginning, little pieces of information come in stages, keeping us interested and guessing how they will accomplish this feat.<br /><br />It is also interesting to learn from current interviews how devoted Philippe's friends and girlfriend were. As they recount their involvement with Phillippe and try to explain why they were so drawn to him, they reveal how much they all loved him. It is evident he is very dynamic and engaging and it is easy to see why he was followed by these people as he attempts to pull of this dangerous feat.<br /><br />There are the inevitable setbacks and these are thrilling to watch as well. The combination of these various elements helps to paint such a full picture we begin to feel we are actually a part of the story, of the mythology. Because we become a part of this tale, these setbacks affect us, make us wince and cringe. The inevitable 'silly' moments (they walk right by a security guard at one point who never says anything) make us laugh in amazement. When you think about it, there are probably very few instances when you become involved in the film to the extent you will become involved in \\"Man on Wire\\".<br /><br />\\"Man on Wire\\" is an involving, fun, interesting documentary. A look at a truly unique and strange individual who goes for his dreams and accomplishes them. With the exception of a brief recreation showing Phillippe partaking in the carnal benefits of his newfound celebrity, \\"Wire\\" is the type of film you should take the entire family to. It might give the kids a little push towards achieving their dreams and goals.<br /><br />Don't miss this fun film. And see it at the theater. Encourage filmmakers to make more films like this.

0143038419|1.0|When I picked up this book, I expected to love it.  I had heard nothing but good things and, being in something of a transitional stage in my own life, I thought it might help to read about another woman's journey.  In the end, I couldn't even finish it, although I tried with a white-knuckled determination to do so.  I usually cannot stop a book halfway through, even if I'm not enjoying it, but reading \\"Eat Pray Love\\" was like trying to enjoy a peaceful day outside while a four year-old hits you on the head every few seconds with a whiffle bat - fine at times, even enjoyable (after all, people have told you that this is a good thing), but with nagging little bursts of annoyance that finally drive you over the edge.  I am just glad I got this book from the library.    It doesn't bother me too much that Elizabeth Gilbert received payment in advance from the publishers when she first pitched the idea of this book (although, I must say, I am a bit baffled that anyone with her mediocre writing ability was able to get a year's travel salary from a publisher in the first place).  I can even learn to live with the fact that she includes endless phrases - nay, entire passages - in Italian, and then kindly translates them for us.  This doesn't serve to make the book authentic in any way, even in the Italy portion, but rather comes across as a smug attempt to prove her ability with the language.  As I said, that's mildly annoying, but I could learn to live with it if the content had been worth reading.    But here's the thing - it's not.  At all.  Gilbert's writing is affected and self-aware.  Her many attempts at humor elicited, at most, a hollow groan from me as I read.  She's self-absorbed, she's not funny, and she's not a particularly good writer.  There's very little to recommend this book, on the whole.  It doesn't even really have much to do with travel.  As one other reviewer pointed out, she says at the beginning that she doesn't want to talk about her divorce, and then proceeds to occupy a good portion of the remaining prose with endless musings on why she left and how \\"un-selfish\\" she was, after all.  I really am a sympathetic person, but reading this was just ridiculous.  These are the childlike, completely un-mind-blowing \\"revelations\\" of a woman who collapses in tears at every opportunity.  She can't even go to a friend's art showing without locking herself in the bathroom and trembling in panic at the thought that one day, she too might have a baby.  It's not even the \\"baby factor\\" alone that really put me off in terms of Gilbert's personality.  I don't want to have a baby, either, but I haven't written any books about it.  It's simply that she sees everything and everyone as existing in the Elizabeth Gilbert universe.  A friend comes to visit her in Rome and she refers to this person as her own personal lamp (the metaphor here is characteristically unoriginal and simultaneously completely dehumanizing to this other person for whom she professes to care).     Early in the book, when she decides to seek medical help for her depression, Gilbert actually brings her three previously published works with her to the psychiatrist's office and says, \\"I'm a writer.  Don't mess up my brain.\\"  (Had anyone actually read anything she'd written before Eat Pray Love?)  This insistent tendency toward self-praise (as in, \\"I can make friends with anyone, so I'll never have to be alone\\") is just one of many irksome qualities of Gilbert's writing.    In short, if you must read it, don't buy it - the library will do.  If you can make it all the way through, good on you.  But in my opinion, life is too short for bad literature, and baby, this is it.

The person who wrote the negative review and directed you to this website [...]  Does not have a brain.  The credentials of the person who wrote this Anti-China Study article has a BS degree in History. I Don't think I am going to listen to him over a doctor who has spent most of his life researching this data. Be careful which reviews you read and who is writing them.

0553582461|5.0|I have reviewed other books of Hobb in the Fitz saga so feel free to read my comments. This was the last book in the magnificent Tawny Man series and I will keep my comments brief. If you have never read any of Hobb's books, yes you are missing out on an icon in fantasy literature. This series and this last book will not mesmerize you like Harry Potter or jolt you like GRR Martin's Fire & Ice series. However it will leave a lasting impression on you because more than anything else, character development is supreme in quality. The plot gets dry at times but the reader can't help being Fitz's friend in their head. The series leaves just the right number of unanswered questions for you to love it and yet scratch your head. The Fool is a prime example.  This is a brilliant book (and series) and strongly recommended.
031606792X|1.0|I really liked Twilight (never as good as any of the HPs, but it was a good book), but after New Moon I knew I would hate the rest of the series-- and I do! I hope Meyers would fix all the problems in her storyline, but it seems her mind- at least in writing this series is as weak and flawed as her characters! I suppose it all was just a weak rip off of Wuthering Heights and Romeo and Juliet, but it lacks enough back-story to allow the reader to understand why so many of the characters are so pathetic, especially the main character, Isabella. You'll end up not liking her more so than sympathizing with her, and her man, Edward goes from being the sharp, keen type, to a pillar to hold up the asinine Bella.    **Series Recap**    Bella is totally pathetic, she's a weak, selfish, flimsy woman. She falls for the VAMPIRE WHO TRIES TO NO AVAIL TO CONVINCE HER LIFE IS WORTH LIVING. He leaves her to protect her, but she will only allow herself to believe he left because she is so worthless! (Which, as the series goes on, you may believe she is.) Through the series Bella laments time and time again, how unworthy she is, and constantly has some man to remind her of her importance! If you have a daughter with any kind of self-esteem issue PLEASE KEEP THESE BOOKS AWAY FROM HER!! Bella uses the young and innocent Native American (Jacob) as a crutch to survive her depression. She knows he loves her but won't deny herself the relief she gets from presence even though she knows she her only love is the vampire (Edward).    Jacob risks his life time and time again to protect her, he's called to duty in the first place because of her relationship with Edward. Despite all Jacob gives to Bella as soon as Edward needs her she tosses Jacob to the side to rescue Edward. When Edward vows to never leave her again, she more or less forgets Jacob, there are some extenuating circumstances but still she does not put up the fight for him that she put up to have Edward in her life. She disrespectsher father, lies to her mother, and does all the things that would break any parent's heart to be with the vampire, and no matter how much she'll think of her poor parents, they're always some kind of afterthought. Granted, in the first book she tries to save her mom, but you'll soon see, if confronted with the idea of leaving Edward to spare them, she'll leave them to have Edward.    Bella refuses to accept that she cannot have both Edward and Jacob as they are mortal enemies, she's determined to have things her way and actually feels like Jacob is wrong for not giving her what she wants, which is to be her best friend while she loves the vampire...to make matter worse Jacob's people have always existed to protect mankind, while Edward is just an oddity who no-longer tries to destroy humanity.     Through the series Bella causes trouble time and time again, but is always rescued. She never develops any self-esteem or any ability to take care of herself. At one point, she actually risks her life just to have delusions of Edward. She doesn't care about how her parents, or Jacob, who she uses to help induce these hallucinations, would feel if she died. She doesn't even care that she could be risking Jacob's life too! She abandons her friends and her family to be with Edward, who never really requested that of her. Edward has to fight with her to attend college, he has to beg her to have a normal human but she desires nothing more than to give it all up. She fears marrying Edward, but is dying to give up her soul to be a vampire; she at one point rationalizes that if she were a vampire, Edward would never want to leave her again...does that make any sense? Her value relies on rather or not a man- a vampire wants her, a horrible self-esteem lesson for every young girl, in a world where you hear of the abuse against women almost daily! A woman fought to be present, while books such as these teach young adult woman, a man is the beginning and ending of existence. I knowit's a fantasy book, but books are meant as educational tools in one way or another. In Harry Potter the message is persistence, faith and overcoming, in Wuthering Heights it's a lesson on karma, and to do unto others etc...    Meyers gave her characters a happy ending they didn't deserve--and if they did deserve it, it's never explained why they did. She uses four pages, every time she mentions Edwards's name to explain his beauty, but practically never explains why he'd crave human love. Simply because he's a vampire isn't enough, because there are plenty of other vampires who get along fine, without love. Is it because he's lonely? She doesn't explain it, but in a way that's too bad too, if he were truly interested in Bella's well being and enjoying what he missed out on--a life. His actions however clearly show that's not the case either, so what? Is he just selfish? Hardly the kind of character you'd want to have a happy ending.    In the end she marries Edward, coaxes him into sex, gets pregnant which according to Meyers own outline should have been impossible. She's a young mom, who must hide the dramatic time from her own mother, who she professes to love so very much. She has the kid, and accepts and expects Jacob to protect it, but then gets angry when he does so the best way he knows how. Never mind the fact, that he is still in love with her, she's inconsiderate! She won't have him, but won't let him go either! And finally Bella and Edward live happily ever after!    It's a sick, sick series! You wouldn't know it by the first book, you'd believe it's a coming of age thing, that Bella will mature, and that you will see her relationship with Edward and Jacob actually gain some substance. Through the series, you're never given any actual reason for the love, not between Ed and Bella or between Jake and Bella. With Edward especially is seems more like lust or some kind of spell, because all she can ever talk about his how handsome, beautifully angelic he isand how his smell makes her forget her thoughts, how his breath lulls her to sleep-- total nonsense.    I know a love story is dramatic, heart wrenching, and usually someone gets jilted, but she takes it to a mental level. It should have some practical basis, or some redeeming qualities. It should make you believe in it, or admire something about it. In the case of The Meyers Series, all she gives you is a self-centered teenage girl who is incapable of not only taking care of herself, but Bella can't even spare others her destruction because she chooses not to. It also sends the message that all little girls need in life, is a man and a baby, and I've wondered if that comes from Meyer's Mormon upbringing? I do not mean to insult any religion, and I do not know anything about Meyers other than what I've read, but this series she's created is truly horrific. It exemplifies some sort of misogynistic idea; women, Bella is clearly the weaker, albeit more manipulative sex.    Spare yourself the trouble, read something else. I usually don't write reviews but this series was so idiotic that I had to say something. I know it's just a book and I know it's a fantasy, but just as we try to hold TV and music responsible for the messages, they send to the youth we must do the same with what our children read. It's problem enough to talk about losing your soul, it's another to happily give it up, but when you add in destructiveness, selfishness, mental illness in the form of self-esteem issues, you have a serious problem that doesn't need to be shared.
B000NDFIZG|5.0|This review is for the Japanese version with bonus dvd.Ever since Phil Demmel joined Machine Head from \\"Through the ashes of empires\\"They are just getting better and better! Phil used to jam with Robb Flynn when they were in a band called Violence back in the late 80's. I feel this is there best album to date If you are a fan of Machine Head and like stuff like \\"Burn My Eyes\\" there first album I know you'll dig this stuff! It's just as brutal with very focused anger in all the right places,there's also excellent guitar riffing between Robb & Phil on this one.As for the product itself You get a bonus track of Metallica's Battery and some cool behind the scenes making of the album and them on the Blackening tour!
B000R7GKQE|5.0|If you're a fan of the show, then season two will satisfy and surpass your expectations.  If you're unfamiliar with the show, then imagine similar horror/drama series with a twist.  This show is absolutely a movie of the week in each episode. But you are ultimately watching a series with a good western feel about a family, and how far they will go to protect each other while trudging through the reason for their existence..helping others.  Supernatural season two has all the \\"creature\\" comforts you have come to expect from the brothers' travels along with progressively more gut wrenching situations, decisions..and sacrifices for the greater good.  Extra features let you peek into what the people who make the show think about the Supernatural universe and how much they put into it's production.  You won't be disappointed to own these, because unlike some other shows, you will actually want to watch these again and again, even after a few years.
0385340990|5.0|After reading a sample, I had this book delivered to my Kindle last Saturday when I was on vacation.  I was immediately enthralled and the book was my constant companion all week during my commute to and from work on the train.  Finally, I just curled up today on a lazy Saturday and read it to the last.  Felt both elated and sad at the ending -- elated because it ended up where I hoped it would; sad because I wanted to read more, learn more about the wonderful characters whom I met through their delightful letters filled with their heartfelt thoughts.  I loved the epistolary format, as it provided the opportunity to hear from many different voices and points of view.  Most of all, I fell in love with Guernsey and wish I could decamp tomorrow to St. Peter Port for a long visit.
0812975219|4.0|This book reads a lot like a self-absorbed blogger's rant, but it is a rant that is highly satisfying to read. Almost all of us have a distant relative or friend who is allegedly a \\"stock market genius\\". Taleb argues that it is usually hard to know whether that person is truly skilled or just lucky. He argues that most often trading success is either the result of ones arbitrary trading style happening to jibe with market conditions or a product of exposure to volatility in a way that allows for small regular gains leading eventually to a spectacular blowup.
1400031001|3.0|I applaud the point of this book, which is to look at a life from its early optimism and grand expectations to the realization of mediocrity and failure to ultimate acceptance.  My problems with these fictional diaries of Uruguayan-born and English-raised Logan Monstuart are twofold: they don't read like actual diaries, even those of a writer, and there is a sense of literary pretentiousness that prevented me from warming to the protagonist, even while I admired his honesty and beautiful prose.    Without resorting to too many spoilers, I'll just say that the best part of this novel is the second portion, which chronicles Monstuart's years at English boarding school and then university.  This part doesn't read like what you would expect to find in the diary of a teenager and a young twenty-something man (what teenager, even one who wants to be a writer, has the time or the inclination to spell out everything he does in full words and perfectly grammatical sentences?), but the experiences felt entirely real and the relationship that Monstuart had with his two best friends, Peter Scabius and Ben Leeping (which continue for the length of the book) were wonderful.  Their comraderie, their jealousies, their prospects, their escapades, their early attempts at meeting girls -- all are richly detailed and riveting in their sheer ordinariness.  You really end up remembering what it was like to be young and excited about the life in front of you.    Where this book starts to go off track is during Montstuart's narrative about his life during World War II.  While it's refreshing in a way not to have another depressing account of life in wartime England, Montstuart is so far from the action and doing so little that the book just drags.  Even as a commentary on how life can start to go off track, the section just isn't remarkable, except for the very end, when something finally does happen to Monstuart.  But it's still so far removed from all the drama of the war that it ends upbeing a disappointing section and when Monstuart gets back to post-wartime England, we really get almost no sense of what it was like.   And I can barely remember anything about the following section, in which Montstuart moves to and lives in New York, even though I just read it this week.  As best I can recall, it contains a lot of Monstuart's thoughts about American artists of the 1950's -- some artistic pretentiousness to go with the literary analyses found elsewhere in the book.  If you're into the art and literature of the early and mid-20th century you might find these parts interesting, but Monstuart's analytical nature kept me from caring about him or even disliking him.  It just kept me away from him, period.  The only remarkable thing about this section is, once again, how Monstuart leaves it.    The portion of the novel set in Nigeria is one of the better portions.  I was really young when the problems in Biafra happened, and I thought the book was educational on this point and brought part of Africa alive for me, something that Boyd manages not to do with most of the locales in the middle of the book.  He improves toward the very end of the book, when Montstuart is an old man, and we start to get a real sense of who he has become and which relationships in his life have been and are meaningful to him.    Overall I really liked watching one life unfold, from an idyllic childhood to a hopeful young adulthood to a sidetracked and disappointed adulthood to an old age marred by impecunity and death, and finally mellowed by some sort of wisdom and grace.  I just wished I could have felt a little bit more for Logan Monstuart, one way or another.  He was just kind of there.  Maybe that was the point.  Worth reading, but not one to get wildly excited about.
0582461367|5.0|I found 2001: Space Odyssey the Movie to be confusing, boring at times, and vastly overrated. The book, however, is fantastic. Plot details that I feel you couldn't possibly glean from the movie are clear in the book. The story actually makes sense. Questions like, \\"Why did HAL go crazy?\\", \\"What exactly happened at the end?\\", and \\"What was the significance of the ape-men at the beginning?\\" all become clear.    Besides the plot, the book was quite satisfying for me on a technical level. Clarke describes many technical aspects of spaceflight in prophetically accurate detail.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|I bought this star trek collection for my brother's birthday. I had it shipped directly to him. I have since asked him how he liked it and he tells me that it is great to have. He says that he falls asleep at night while watching the old shows, just like the old days.  Can't go wrong getting this for a star trek lover.  Good price too!!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|After seeing the movie, we were very delighted with the music.  We wanted to have the cd so we could hear the music again and again.  We thought the cd was even better than the movie.  The sound recording was great.  We have very expensive equipment in our home, our car and can usually find out if the quality of the recording is good or not and found that this recording to be of high quality recording.  The voices were good, and found that the singers took their time to make sure the cd was done right.  We did miss a couple of songs from the movie but found that what was on the cd was worth the price of the recording.  If you enjoyed the movie, you will continue to enjoy the music even more with this audio recording.
031606792X|1.0|The Twilight series (Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse) was definitely, hands down, one of my all time favorite books. I'm not sure what went on with Breaking Dawn. It was not up to par to say the least. All the events that happened as I went on just had me thinking, \\"what the heck is going on?\\" It was very awkward and I felt like she was just rambling about things, prolonging the storyline, when it was not necessary. If her intent was to leave you not wanting more, she definitely accomplished it.
B00005JPY0|1.0|The Dark Knight is a long, boring ripoff of the Saw movies. The joker in this movie is basically Jigsaw, omnipotent, with a sick need for sadism and torture. Just look at the scene where the guy had the cell phone stitched into his abdomen. We've seen that before. The story was convoluted and uninteresting. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I still haven't figured out what so many people find interesting about this film. It is sick, pointless, and soulless.
B000A6T1KE|3.0|What a sad, depressing way to pretty much end an amazing franchise, Star Trek Nemesis, the tenth film in the series, finally ended the Trekkie theory that every even numbered movie was colossal while the odds were medicore at best. The early 2000's weren't a good time for the franchise, with ST:Voyager ending it's run less than a year earlier and leaving ST:Enterprise alone and not doing a good job ratings or storywise. This was the third solo Next Generation film (not counting '94's Generations which was old with new casts), and the appeal was stating to really, really wear thin.<br /><br />Once again the Next Gen crew are sent on a typical mission (much like the previous film, the \\"hippie-like\\" Insurrection) to speak to a missionary representative of a subrace of the Romulans known as the Remans, who look nothing like them with their white disfigured bat-like faces. But when Captain Picard and crew get there, they find out their new leader is actually a twenty-something clone of the Captain known as Shinzon. He says all he wants is peace between the three parties, but of course in true Star Trek fashion his real mission is to destroy the Romulan Empire, the Federation, and his dopperganger Picard himself.<br /><br />Sure, the special effects are up to typical Star Trek fashion but that's all they reach, which is typical. Not much new is going on here except for an out-of-place, land based, dune-buggy race (in Star Trek?) and many endings/beginning of the ST:TNG storyline. After a twenty year courtship, Riker and Troi are getting married and leaving the Enterprise (with Riker getting his own command), and Data discovers another android like him, though not as intelligent, that he refers to as his brother known as B-4....get it, \\"before\\"....all while glossing over the fact that Data's had a brother before in the series known as Lore that this movie completely ignores.<br /><br />I think that cast and crew knew when making this film that the franchise truly had dried up at this point. There just wasn't much more to do with this crew and it shows all around. While die-hard Trekkies will find this entertaining, this was not the way they should have ended it. Tom Hardy as the younger Picard clone does look & sound alot like Patrick Stewart (minus a much larger upper-lip), but as a main villain he has no spark or appeal like ones in the past and Sci-Fi favorite Ron Perlman as his viceroy doesn't make things any better. And in true desperate writing fashion, one important main cast member dies, though like Spock earlier yet alot easier, could come back just like nothing ever happened.<br /><br />As for the Paramount 2 Disc Special Edition, like the others it's filled with amazing CGI menus, detailed behind-the-scenes footage, and tons of extras, but after seeing the film realizing that it didn't work as well as Picard and crew are now forever in drydock, you might not want to see them to know more of what went wrong. Though, even if you're a somewhat Star Trek or Sci-Fi fan, you'll should see this to know how it all ends, but don't expect a great warp into the sunset like Shatner's cast did in Part Six. Seeing Nemesis, it will probably explain to you why it's taking seven years to make another film, plus being a reboot going back to the Original Series storyline instead of continuing this one. But you never know in the world of Star Trek, maybe in the future we'll see Picard, Riker, and Data again....yes, even that third guy.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:7.5/10)ere just wasn't much more to do with this crew and it shows all around.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I love this record, its the most inspired recording of the nineties from beginning to end.  Even the lyrics are  really on, at times its like Thom Yorke is my long lost brother the way his mind works and the things that he's thinking about.  \\"Exit Music\\" is my favorite Radiohead song because of how intense it is.  A lot of this record seems to be driven by spite and bitterness but that's all good - better get that energy out in the studio then with a machine gun in a school yard.  And the best way to kill someone is to shame them into killing themselves anyway right?  Radiohead's smartest move has been to not even attempt to top this record and instead go and make more atmospheric, moody music; this is the peak and would be for anybody.
B001EN71DQ|1.0|A new box doesn't make these films any better, George.  Nice try.  There is nothing new in this set folks, so don't bother.
B0000C9ZSV|2.0|The music is excellent.  No question about it.  However, the imbecile responsible for cutting the LP version of the album should be subjected to a class action lawsuit because it's the WORST record I have ever come across.  The grooves are not centered and thus not circular, forcing the tone arm to slide back and forth, and therefore the needle against one wall of the groove and then the other.  DO NO BUY THIS LP.  It was poorly manufactured.  Buy the CD instead.
0385340990|4.0|I picked this book up for my wife to read over our summer vacation and ended up reading it first.  I picked it up before realizing it was a hot seller and had my doubts due to its form, letters (epistolary, I now know), since previous books I've read like this left me wanting more.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  The book unveils the story of the Guernsey Islands during and recently after WWII and how the war changed the lives of the inhabitants.  The form of the book suits is subject and adds to the suspense and drama, allowing for changes in voice and perspecitves that may have been more difficult in a different form.<br /><br />The way the authors weave together the various characters' stories is engaging, basically, each character letting you see what they want you to see, while at the same time giving insight to the other characters that they didn't.<br /><br />I also like the underlying theme that reading is and can be so much more to someones existence than a simple pastime or hobby.<br /><br />I highly recommend the book to avid readers and history buffs.
B0006Z2KYI|3.0|I love \\"The Jack Benny Show\\". I don't see the humor in this DVD. Must be me. Otherwise it's a great product. No defects.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|This movie was cute fun, but not up there with the original trilogy.  Either way, I would buy it normally because it's Indiana \\"Friggin\\" Jones, but not at $35.  Sorry, Georgie, but you'll have to make your next billion without me.  No single movie is worth $35 - ever!
B00004WEJZ|4.0|1983 was \\"the battle of the Bonds\\". That year both Roger Moore and Sean Connery starred in two separate James Bond film, the former (Octopussy) was produced by the \\"official\\" makers of the Bond films while the later (Never Say Never Again) was produced \\"unofficially\\" by a group led by Kevin McClory who held the film rights to Thunderball. Surprisingly enough is the \\"unofficial\\" film that is better despite the obvious flaw of missing elements from the official films and the fact that Never Say Never Again is a remake of Thunderball.<br /><br />Never Say Never Again has the distinction of sporting one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond film. It all starts with Sean Connery, returning to the play Bond for the first time since 1971's Diamonds Are Forever. Connery might be older then he was then but he looks better here then he did in Diamonds Are Forever. Gone is the bored Bond of Diamonds and in is an older version of the Bond of the early Connery films. The Bond of Never Say Never Again is the sleek and dangerous shark of Dr. No or From Russia With Love, just a few years older. Connery's delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was. The one downside to Connery's age is his believability, especially when it comes to the ladies of the film. Let's face it even Connery, despite being in top physical shape, looks as odd as Moore when he is bedding women half his age. Yet despite this believability issue, Never Say Never Again shows Connery in one of his better Bond performances and a definite improvement on his two earlier Bond performances.<br /><br />Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of her early film roles. Bassinger plays the role with considerable confidence for a relative newcomer and she makes the character believable. Bassinger holds her own against her co-stars and has considerable chemistry with them as well. In fact she may well outshine her Thunderball counter-part played by Claudine Auger.<br /><br />Then there's the villain, Maximilian Largo played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer's Largo is everything a James Bond film villain should be: suave, charming, evil and above all believable none the less. One can believe in the villain of this film, a billionaire playboy with an evil streak in him that remains well hidden. Brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap many other Bond villains have fallen into by going over the top. Brandauer plays Largo with a silent menace and charisma unseen in many adversaries of 007.<br /><br />The excellent cast extends into the supporting cast as well. Barbara Carrera makes a fine henchwoman in the guise of Fatima Blush and the screen lights up when ever she appears. Max Von Sydow makes a rather nice appearance as Blofeld, though his appearance is more akin to a cameo role.  Rowan Atkinson makes an early screen appearance as Bond's bumbling contact in the Bahamas that makes for some of the best scenes in the film. With all that the highlight of the supporting cast comes from the MI6 staff from Edward Fox's M who makes for a great contrast to Bernard Lee, Pamela Salem who make s affine Moneypenny and the icing on the cake with Alec McCowen's wonderful Q. The supporting cast has a couple of misfires though in the form of Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter (the first African-American to play the role) and Gavin O'Herlihy as Jack Petachi who both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles. Otherwise this film sports one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond film.<br /><br />On top of an excellent cast the film has several other essential ingredients: good action sequences, good special effects and good direction. From the opening Central America sequence to the fight at Shrublands to the underwater sequences and motorbike chase, this is a film where the action sequences are not only great but service the plot as well for the most part.  The film also sports good special effects in terms of cruise missile models, explosions,and all the things we expect from a Bond film. Irvin Kershner, then fresh off doing The Empire Strikes Back for the Star Wars series, brings a tight sense of direction to the film especially in sequences like the substation of nuclear warheads and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles.<br /><br />Yet this film is far from perfect. Never Say Never Again is easily one of the most dated of the Bond films with its heavy use of 1980's computer sand video games.  While technology dates any film after a time, this film's heavy reliance on it, especially in the hijacking of the cruise missiles and the Domination sequence makes the film look incredibly dated some quarter of a century after its release.  The script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the very fact it's a remake of Thunderball.<br /><br />Yet for its predictability the script for Never Say Never Again is pretty good.  The script sports good dialogue scenes, not a single cringe worthy one liner (how many of the Roger Moore era scripts can you say that about?), some humorous situations, and yet is watchable and tense for the most part. Once you look past he fact that it's a remake, there's quite a lot of good things in the script for the film.<br /><br />Music is in fact the biggest weakness of the film. Due to the \\"unofficial\\" status of the film, the James Bond Theme could not be used. That said this could have shown with the right composer that a Bond score without it could work. Unfortunately first choice James Horner (fresh off Star Trek II at the time) was passed over in favor of Michael Legrand, whose score is far from adequate. Legrand's score is totally out of place in a Bond film and there is only of or two places where it actually works. To make matters worse the film is also lumbered with one of the worst title sequences ever to grace a James Bond Theme.<br /><br />Yet despite being heavily dated, somewhat predicable, and having a bad score Never Say Never Again is still a good Bond film. With one of the best casts of any Bond film, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction, and some terrific dialogue. Never Say Never Again proves that \\"unofficial\\" isn't a bad thing.  In fact it is better then quite a few official films and is better then Octopussy and the winner of \\"the battle of the Bonds\\".a Bond film.

0375424474|4.0|Through extensive fossil records and geneology, Mr. Shubin takes the reader through the development of single celled organisms (bacteria), multi-cell (jellyfish), bodies (worms), skull (fish), hands and feet (reptiles), three-boned middle ear (mammals), and finally, bipedal with large brain (humans).    We have in us anatomical design improvements that can take us only so far from our water borne ancestors.  Mr. Shubin asserts if humans were designed from scratch, \\"we would not have to suffer everything from hemorrhoids to cancer.\\"    If, like me, you have always wondered why the male scrotum tucks close to the body in chilly weather, \\"Your Inner Fish\\" is an excellent source.    Curiously, Mr. Shubin made no mention of how a Cro-Magnon was able to win the U.S. presidency twice; in 2000 and 2004.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|After reading the reviews about my top choices for an afforable USB turntable, I came to the conclusion that unless it had some major flaw that made it unusable or introduced some intollerable noise, one turntable at this price was just about the same as any other. I chose the Sony because it came with software that you couldn't just download for free. Sound Forge Audio Studio is quite easy to use and the the fact that it supports .wma so I can edit clips recorded from other sources.    I did download Audacity and like it too. In fact, I switch back and forth, depending on the project. What suprised me was that the sofware wouldn't detect the breaks between songs very well while using the USB interface. I think the gain is just too high and can't be adjusted down that I can tell. Luckily, this unit has it's own preamp and allows me to hook it up at line level to the computer's sound card input. Now the software will detect the individual songs and treat them accordingly.  I don't know if this is a flaw with this particular unit or all USB input. The other benefit of using line level over USB is that you can hear what is being recorded. With the USB input, you can't (unless I'm missing something).    All in all, I'm pleased with my purchase and even more pleased that my decision to go with the Sony model got me two choices of recording software.
B0017MO10U|5.0|This was the best Stargate movie yet. Great plot and special effects. Good action and acting.
B000063UR1|3.0|Not bad Sci-Fi for the 1970's, \\"Silent Running\\" is a movie with an environmental message. Here are my observations:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good Sci-Fi Plot<br />Good Message<br />Good Special Effects<br /><br />Cons:<br />Bad Acting<br />Moves Very Slowly<br /><br />This could have been a very good movie if the acting was up to the message!<br /><br />CFH
B0018RWMNM|5.0|MUCH better than the original DVD.  We watched it on our 73'' HDTV and it was wonderful.  It is not as perfect as a movie that would come out today, but it is really good!  Don't worry about cropping, etc.  It looks great and you will enjoy.
1416550518|5.0|This debut novel got off to a wobbly start by borrowing straight from REBECCA. After that blip, I couldn't put the book down and almost made myself sick by staying up all night 3 nights in a row to finish it, not to mention reading all day instead of attending to responsibilities. What a stunning debut novel & what a shame it took 2 years to get to the USA. There aren't any great insights into human nature, but Kate Morton takes a somewhat complicated plot line, weaves in and out of the present and the past seamlessly and delivers a stunning whopper end that left me wanting to start the book over to see where I missed the hints (well, one \\"surprise\\" was fairly obviously given away) as to how it would end. I can't wait for her next book and I sure as heck hope her agent gets an overseas contract that gets it published here the same time as the UK. Not fair to make us wait!
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Uh... excuse me... I have a question. Why the hell is this movie thirty-five bucks? I wanted to pre order this to complete my Indiana Jones set but the darn thing is almost twice the price of any other new popular movie. Anyone else feel like Lucasfilm, or whoever, is sticking a gun in their ribs? The movie was OK but not great. This is just another example of \\"Corporate America\\" offering shoddy goods at an outrageous price. The economy in this country is the pits and these guys are taking full advantage of that that. They think they have us by the short ones and will just pay this ridiculous price. Well, this consumer can wait, let it sit on the shelf for a few years, and pick it up at Target for nine dollars.
0385340990|5.0|Go figure.  I thought the title would throw be off to the point that I  wouldn't read, it but I picked it up on my own without the encouragement of the wife, and what a surprise-I loved this book.  Good to great character development, an interesting story and now a desire to travel to the Channel Islands to meet all these folks.  Read this in one day (320 pages).  Written in correspondence fashion and with good story development through this format.  You won't be disappointed.

B000W4KT6E|3.0|This ain't exactly my cup of tea, but I can enjoy movies that aren't my normal fare. We should all be open minded and try new things. Take a walk on the wild side, you know what I mean?? But anyway, if you enjoyed HAIRSPRAY you should definitely check out John Water's film version. The original film had Sonny Bono, Debbie Harry, and Ricki Lake in it. I've seen most of this one and I saw Water's version years ago. Waters is a talented cat. By the way, if you like HAIRSPRAY and are one of those unfortunate souls out there that have not experienced other classic comedies by John Waters PINK FLAMINGOS comes highly recommended. It's just good light entertainment for the family to enjoy.
0060899190|5.0|Finally, after having this on my wish list for forever, I finally bought it.  This will be a great coffee table book.  I loved the post card artwork and the layout of this book.  This is more of an art book than a book meant for just revealing secrets.  Don't let this deter you from reading it, though.  While the words may be few, they can run the gammit of making you laugh out loud, to making you empathize, to making you cry.  It's a powerful book.  Both the postcard art and words are artwork in themselves.  I think it's so interesting, it will be hard for anyone to resist taking it off your coffee table to flip through.  I'm glad I bought it.  Plus, someone slipped their own admission into the book I purchased, which I thought was pretty cool. (Gasp, I did not buy it from Amazon, although I recommend you do because I paid the full price for it at Barnes and Noble.)

B000YAA68C|5.0|Having been widowed, I found this movie not only very realistic but very uplifting. Holly finds starting over after the death of her husband easier because of Jerry's last act of love for his wife. He knew how to help her heal and begin a new life because he knew her best.<br /><br />Grief is accurately depicted as crushing without bogging the film down in sentiment or floods of tears. This film is proof that our loved ones remain with us, and life goes on.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD was recommended by a friend. I have lost 5 pounds after doing the video for 10 days. I managed to get to level 2, but have not attempted level 3 yet. I used to go to the gym 5 times a week for 30 minutes to 1 hour and had lost weight but was at a plateo. My legs were burning the first day! The only thing to note is I think you need to start with 2 or 3 pound weights because they really work mucles you never work out and you will be hurting the first few days.
B000002LSV|5.0|It was a great experience.  I got my cd when I was suppose to.  It was on back order and the company kept me updated the whole time.  I knew when it was on back order, when it came in, and when it was shipped.  I will def. use this company again.
0312360266|1.0|I picked this book up while waiting for Breaking Dawn to release.  The cover was nice, the story had promise, the reviews looked good...Then I read the book and it was an awful experience.  I'm of the opinion that the mother wrote an ok book and then handed it to the daughter to \\"Teen\\" it up for her.  Most of this is apparent in off-topic side comments, too many current pop culture references, and parenthesis.  In fact, because the book was so awful to read through that I grabbed out a pen and started editing the book, crossing out the parenthesis, cutting down paragraphs.  THAT was fun.  And out of that came an ok short story.
B0001I561E|5.0|This DVD came quicker than I expected and it looked brand new. My daughter loves it and watches it 3 times a day. That is all that mattered.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|People have done a good job of explaining plot points.  I will just say that this is a thoughtful movie that doesn't give any easy answers.  Can we really divide the world between good and evil?  And if there is a good side, do acts of revenge keep the 'good' from going evil?  Slight criticisms.  The movie is long and many scenes seem drawn out.  The dialog is not outstanding and the plot and acting drive the movie along.  The end scene which is controversial, no spoilers, was not to my liking.  It was too heavy handed.  Munich was a tragedy and the act of killing atheletes was an evil act.  However did Israel strike back with too much force?  What led up to the act.  How many Palestines believed the killings would help their cause.  Many more questions to ponder in a time when we are looking for quick 30 second answers.
B00005NTN5|5.0|I'm going out on a limb here, but I think this is the best work that the Wachowski Brothers have ever done.  This is an awesome film noir, a film where you have no idea what's going to happen.  I remember sweating bullets during it because, as an avid film person, I usually figure this stuff out.  But this film kept me guessing until the end, which is something most modern films don't do.<br /><br />Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon are awesome as the leads, and Joey Pantoliano gives a great, great performance as a deranged heavy that may lose it at any time.  Many have made hay about the 2 lead characters being lesbians, which to me ultimately doesn't matter.  The film itself is incredible tense and entertaining, and you forget about the fact that the two lead women are lesbians, even though the sex scenes are quite steamy.<br /><br />For all of the fanfare of the Matrix films and the debacle of the Speed Racer film, it's nice to see this film and remember that the Wachowski Brothers actually can make a great film without CGI.  This is their best film.
0553296981|5.0|I have finally, at the age of 33, gotten around to reading Anne Frank's diary.  There is little point in adding another glowing review.  Everything has been said.  But after reading some of the negative reviews, I feel compelled to respond.  It seems there are two primary criticisms (Three if you count the ridiculous idea that the diary is a forgery, which I won't dignify).  The first is that Anne doesn't talk a lot about the war or the holocaust.  To this, I can only say, that's all for the better.  She was a thirteen year girl living in total isolation from the rest of the world.  She really had no special expertise or light to shed on these subjects.  There are many excellent history books on both of these subjects.  The second criticism is simply that the book is boring.  She talks too much about her day to day life, her thoughts, her feelings, and so on.  To this I can only say, what part of \\"Diary of a Young Girl\\" is ambiguous?  The annex was her entire world.  What do you expect her to write about?<br /><br />  What a few don't seem to understand is that this is not a \\"book about World War II\\", or even about the holocaust.  If that is what she had written about, the diary wouldn't even be a footnote in history.  This is the story of one young girl, in her own voice, trying to figure out what it means to live, to grow, and to be human in the most depraved and inhumane circumstances.  She wrote about her hopes, her dreams, her fears, and occasionally about peeling potatoes.  But the thing that some people don't see is that even when writing about the most mundane topics, she was actually writing about people, about how they endure and falter, about how they come together and how they fall apart.  And despite the enormous injustice she endured, she always made the case for optimism, for hope in humanity, and for love of life.  I don't know that I can agree with her, having adopted a more cynical outlook, but that just increases my admiration for her and my shame in myself for not living the gift of live to the fullest.<br /><br />  The other thing that stands out is the maturity of the writing.  After reading just the first entry, I was blown away by the eloquence and clarity of Anne's writing.  I could hardly believe that I was reading the prose of a 13 year old girl.  She does write a lot about the trials and tribulations of being a teenage girl, but the voice of the writing does not feel childish at all, except perhaps in its optimism.  The world lost a great talent and a brilliant soul to those murderous barbarians.<br /><br />  This is a difficult book to digest, and two days after finishing, I'm still haunted by it.  Anne's optimism, faith, and courage inspired me throughout, but made the knowledge of what would come at the end all the more a bitter pill to swallow.  All that we can do is to honor her by making sure her story and the story of millions of holocaust victims are never forgotten and never happen again.  So far, we're not doing so well with that.<br /><br />  And there, I've done it.  I've written a review.  I didn't intend to, but I did.  So go out and read it, if you haven't.in myself for not living the gift of live to the fullest.<br /><br />  The other thing that stands out is the maturity of the writing.

0517543052|5.0|Back in 2005, I came across this book via a friend who had recently and unexpectedly passed away.  Her own family wasn't very close with her and gave us, her group of spiritual friends, the reigns in commemorating her life.  One of the things we did was hold a memorial service and give away all her books to anyone who wanted them.  Out of the hundreds that were on the tables, this book -without reading any excerpts from it- caught my attention, and I took it home with me.  Little did I know how truly life-altering all these events were at the time.<br /><br />When I read this book, it started out like any other... a story of the relevant parts of Richard's life preceeding his trip to Inida.  That itself was fascinating to me, as I enjoyed reading about his LSD trips and spiritual meanderings.  But nothing had prepared me for the experience of reading the comic book like center pages of this book.  I found my sense of reality cracked and shattered by what I read there.  For weeks, I could not feel connected to the illusions I'd never even questioned previously.  Everything changed; I saw what lies beneath and the stupidity of this life I was living.  Nothing made sense anymore; except what I'd been exposed to by this cracking up of my existence.<br /><br />This book forever changed the direction of my life.  I was what I termed \\"spiritual but not religous\\" before that, but even that illusion was shown to be superficial.  It was not long, a year or so more, before I came across a mystic of our own times.  And I didn't even have to travel to India to find him.  When the student is ready, the teach always comes.
B00004BZ16|4.0|The Clash's fourth album, Sandinista!, may be the most eclectic rock album ever recorded. While their previous release, London Calling, was a diverse collection, Sandinista! found the band pulling out all the stops musically. Also worth noting is that while there was a joyous atmosphere around many of the songs on London Calling, the mood is very somber for most of Sandinista! And while not every track works (a nearly impossible feat in a 36 song collection), most of the tunes are very good with a few being among their best.<br /><br />Disc 1 shows the band trying a little of everything whether it's rap (\\"The Magnificent Seven\\"), rockabilly (\\"The Leader\\"), disco (\\"Ivan Meets G.I. Joe\\"), funk (\\"Lightning Strikes\\"), Motown soul (\\"Hitsville U.K.\\"), jazz (their cover of \\"Look Here\\"), ska (\\"If Music Could Talk\\") or gospel (\\"The Sound of Sinners\\"). However, the genres that emerge the most are new wave with \\"Somebody Got Murdered\\" and \\"Up in Heaven (Not Only Here)\\" and reggae with \\"The Crooked Beat\\", \\"Junco Partner\\", and \\"One More Time\\", which is also joined by a dub version appropriately titled \\"One More Dub.\\"  Of the two discs, Disc 1 is the stronger of the two with \\"The Magnificent Seven\\", \\"The Crooked Beat\\", \\"Somebody Got Murdered\\", and \\"Up in Heaven\\" being the best songs and \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" being the only subpar tune.<br /><br />Disc 2 continues the eclecticism with a heavier emphasis on reggae and dub.  This time, the band cover hard rock on the opening \\"Police on My Back\\" and attempt psychedelia on \\"Mensforth Hill\\", which is \\"Something About England\\" played backwards. The latter may have worked for the Beatles on The White Album but here it's one of a few failed experiments on the disc. We get more rockabilly on \\"Midnight Log\\" and more new wave on \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\", and three gems in the anti-war track \\"The Call Up\\", the dance tune \\"Version City\\", and the ballad \\"Broadway.\\" The reggae tunes are very good with \\"The Equaliser\\" and \\"Washington Bullets\\" being the best on the album. There are a few clunkers here like \\"Silicone on Sapphire\\", \\"Shepherd's Delight\\", and an ill advised cover of their own \\"Career Opportunities\\" but fortunately they're near the end of the disc. In closing, Sandinista! is by far the most challenging release of the Clash's catalog. However, several listens and a bit of patience reveal this to be a compelling album..

B0016AJU2C|4.0|I have really enjoyed this new album from Alanis.  The funny thing is 80 percent of the time I am listening to the bonus disc.  It has the best songs on it, which the people who bought the regular album are missing out on.  How did this happpen?

It felt....thrown together, something I'm not used to feeling when it comes to Stargate.     This movie was decent but I'd pick the previous movie over it any day.
B001B71NOI|5.0|This is an album that is really genially made, as all Trent's work.  Beautiful songs whether only instrumental or not.  Perfect in every and each way.  And the album comes with stickers!  It is really a piece of art.
0807262013|4.0|interesting story with a full cast of voices.  Pullman takes a long time to finish up the narrative, but it's probably necessary.  no bad music in this volume, but the poetry at the beginning of each chapter is hard to get when read quickly out loud.  it adds nothing to this audio version.  that part would make more sense in print.
B00168HARG|5.0|I had enjoyed Sarah Connor during its initial run on Fox.  I was disappointed that it, like many shows, had to cut down on episodes due to the writer's strike.  However, upon a second viewing on Blu-Ray, the show seemed to get even better.  Thomas Dekker takes over the reigns as John Connor, and Lena Headey replaces Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor.  Both do well.  Summer Glau is a real treat as Cameron Phillips.  Upon first viewing, I thought that the writers had really screwed up writing Cameron, regressing her ability to act human quite a bit after the pilot episode.  It didn't feel that way the second time through, so maybe this series gains some momentum on Blu-Ray that makes the inconsistencies less noticeable.    Blu-Ray is where this series belongs.  The picture quality is quite good, and the sound is amazing.  The extras here are quite nice - there are quite a few deleted scenes, some commentaries, auditions, and a few others.      The first season is only 9 episodes, but they are all engaging.

B001CD6FKS|1.0|While this is obviously on the short list for the worst movie of 2008, I have decided that instead of totally bashing this movie (which is WAAAY too easy to do), I'll list those who might enjoy watching this movie...    1) You always wondered what it would be like to BE INSIDE \\"Mario Kart\\" the video game.    2) If the thought of someone pouring hot, melted Starburst candies into your corneas sounds enjoyable.    3) If you've always wondered what it would feel like if you could be stuffed inside of a kaleidoscope and shaken for two hours.    4) You like overacting and cheesy dialogue    5) You like movies that are thrilled to be less or movies that are delusions minus the grandeur.    6) You don't consider a movie enjoyable unless you can walk away with a good headache.     If you are any of the above, ENJOY!  If not, you might want to just say \\"Go Speed Racer!  Go (away)!\\"
B00026WU82|4.0|This CD is a real classic.  I would have given it 4 1/2 stars but the computer didn't seem to be able to give it that rating.  Anyway, I love the CD and I can't believe it took me so many years to finally buy it.  But it is a great CD and one everyone should have in their collection.
B00005JPS8|4.0|It's been a long time since I've seen a movie in the movie theaters (having a one-year old will do that to you).  I've scrupulously avoided any spoilers for just about every summer movie out there, although more than one reviewer has given away quite a few surprises (I'm looking at you, Entertainment Weekly).  When we finally got a babysitter willing to take care of our little tyke for a few hours, we decided to given the second-run movie theater nearby a try.  And that movie was Iron Man.<br /><br />By now everyone knows the story of Iron Man: alcoholic weapons-merchant billionaire Tony Stark has a change of heart (literally) when shrapnel penetrates his ribcage and threatens to end his life.  Instead of making weapons, Stark vows to make a power suit instead...that is loaded with weapons, but let's not quibble over details.<br /><br />Iron Man is an adult's movie, which is to say it involves mature subjects like the fact that Stark is an inveterate womanizer, likes his alcohol, kills bad guys, and many of those bad guys look like Middle Eastern terrorists.  All this drama is tempered by Robert Downey Jr., who rattles off quips with abandon.  His keeper is Obadiah Stane (played by Jeff Bridges with suitable cranky menace).  Stark's assistant is the alliterative Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who runs the line between sweetly naïve and sleekly sexy in her five-inch heels and pencil skirt.<br /><br />At its best, Iron Man features Stark uses his power suit to dodge jet fighters, kill terrorists, and rescue civilians.  The theater I was in didn't have very good audio, so the (presumably adlibbed) one-liners that Downey constantly tosses off were often lost in the sounds of explosions and screaming.  I imagine in a bigger theater or at home this wouldn't be a problem, but the movie lost some of its charm as a result.<br /><br />There are plot holes. Vanity Fair reporters show up at important news conferences. Stark seems far more interested in building a power suit than removing the shrapnel from his body.  And the entire premise of Iron Man revolves around \\"repulsor lift\\" technology, which is an infinite source of energy the size of a hockey puck that defies gravity. But if you didn't buy into the notion of a man in a flying suit, what are you doing watching the movie, right?<br /><br />Iron Man keeps the plot tight. Unlike Spider-Man, there are no extraneous supervillains. Unlike X-Men, every character is there for a reason.  But the big payoff for Iron Man is the ending.  Iron Man flips traditional superhero conventions the bird and dares you to guess what happens next.  Then it leaves you begging for more.<br /><br />And there IS more, if you stay for the end of the credits.  Unfortunately, I didn't read enough spoilers to realize I should have waited, so we missed it.  So for the three of you who haven't seen the movie yet...stick around!his body.

B0018M6J90|2.0|One would think pairing Frances McDormand and Amy Adams for `Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day' would be irresistible.   Adams stars as Delysia LaFosse, a hyperventilating American starlet living in England just before World War II.  Here she reminds us of the charm she gave so easily in '[[ASIN:B000BYRCQU Junebug]]' and '[[ASIN:B0011U52E2 Enchanted (Full Screen Edition)]]'.  McDormand, whose acting dexterity is only rivaled by the likes of Meryl Streep, gave us a flawless Minnesotan accent to go with a perfect performance in '[[ASIN:0792846427 Fargo]]' and a Southern accent for her marvelous debut in `[[ASIN:B001B1UO7G Blood Simple]]'.  Now she plays the title character, a nearly homeless lower class woman with a dumpy wardrobe.  And, yes, her gentle cockney accent is spot on.  While both performances are up to snuff, the movie's breezy charm and sometimes droll development prevent the whole affair from taking full life.      At the beginning Guinevere Pettigrew's luck is about to worsen as her employment agency supervisor relates how she has obtained no favorable reviews for any of her work assignments.  Showing ingenuity, she grabs a hold of the business card of a prospective client before she is dismissed for good.  She then arrives at Delysia's upscale residence where the flummoxed starlet is fumbling to get ready for the day while still entertaining a lover in bed.  Quickly, Guinevere learns of her many trysts, which Delysia tries to manage with lilting skill.  There's Philip (Phil)[Tom Payne] in her bed; then Nick (Mark Strong) a nightclub owner who shows up at what turns out to be his place after all.  Meanwhile, Michael (Lee Pace) has another offer she can't yet refuse.      Not merely relying on lust, Delysia dates Phil while trying out for a part in his London play; Nick often features her at his nightclub; and Michael has a stake as he offers to have her accompany him at a set of NYC shows.  She's just a girl who can't say no.        Sorting out her priorities between work and love, Delysia needs Guinevere to give her a backbone and maneuver her through all her duplicity.  Miss Pettigrew, the daughter of a minister, needs bread to feed her, but finds the job description \\"fraught with moral complexity\\".    There's plenty of charm to be sure.  Just as one expects from the trailer, the movie does deliver a \\"Cinderella\\" makeover element that's fun to watch.  Going to a fashion show luncheon, Delysia introduces her to Edyth Duberry (Shirley Henderson), the announcer, whose scathing commentary during Joe Blumfield's ladies underwear catwalk extravaganza only reveals the fury of a former fiance scorned.  Edyth, who contributes to the `[[ASIN:B0009KA7N6 Pygmalion]]' transformation, expects to be repaid by Miss Pettigrew's smoothing finesse to heal the fissure in their relationship.      Call me curmudgeon, but it really takes until the second half for the movie to get its traction.  I love feel good movies, and I love the ensemble gathered together, but the intended whimsy is fleeting like cotton candy instead of latter portions of the movie where it's deeper and richer like English pudding.  World War II as a backdrop doesn't mean that much, except to show us the arrogant indifference (and sometimes fear) of Miss Pettigrew's aristocratic counterparts.  In the end, 'Miss Pettigrew...' is cutesy, but often hollow.      A J.P.'s Pan 2.5*'s = Mediocre-Fair
B000A2XC1C|5.0|If the North Pole was anything like it is portrayed in this movie, I want to live there. The scene when Mrs. Claus had to choose green or red for the first Santa suit was awesome. He put that red coat on and you could almost hear a choir singing! And when the reindeer and sleigh took off for the first flight it was breathtaking. Five big stars for this movie. It is my favorite Christmas movie now. I have even bought it for friends so they could get as excited watching it for the first time as I did.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|Too many movies these days start off strong then falter in the middle and end up poorly. Not so with the Bank Job. This is an entertaining, well crafted, well acted movie from start to finish. When it was over all I could think of was \\"that was a great movie\\".  Another enjoyable facet of this movie was the recreation of the early 1970's, with all of the great English cars around at that time. I spotted my old 1970 Rover 3500s, so I knew they were getting the cars right, as well as the clothes, and what London looked like then. All of the actors were very accomplished, but as the producer said, when you're filming in England, you have an abundance of acting talent to choose from, and they did. Oh, and did I mention this movie was also funny! This movie succeeds on all levels and is worthy of the critical acclaim it has received.

B0018M6J90|2.0|On the surface, it's easy to see why viewers might be drawn to the mindless diversion of \\"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day\\".  With the evening news broadcasting reports of never-ending atrocities in Africa and the Middle East, escalating crime woes in American cities, and devastating economic downturns, \\"Miss Pettigrew\\" offers a return to a different time and place, specifically the era of the British stiff upper lip in a London not yet affected by the Second World War.  In this world, fast-talking, loose-living theater folk emulate the characters in an Astaire/Rogers musical, flitting breezily from cocktail parties to fashion shows to jazzy nightclubs, while penniless spinsters cling to their dignity in soup lines.  By hook or by crook, everbody's looking for something better, but nobody is what they pretend to be; they're all about appearances, what's projected on the surface.  Which is the big problem with this movie.  \\"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day\\" is all about setting the mood for a particular place in time; it's about capturing the style of dialogue spoken in the frothy Hollywood screwball comedies of the thirties and early forties; it's about depicting a way of life that I'm not sure really existed outside the fevered imaginations of underpaid screenwriters.  But, underneath the gloss and high velocity chatter of \\"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day\\", there's nothing.  It's an empty, lovely vessel carrying such luminaries as Frances McDormand, Amy Adams, and Lee Pace across a sea of banality.    To be sure, there is very little plot.  Miss Pettigrew, the middle-aged daughter of a vicar, has been let go from her latest job as a nanny (apparently, she tends to aid children in their misbegotten adventures).  Desperate, but ever-virtuous, the poor woman guiltily snatches a business card from the snooty woman at her temp agency, and immediately finds herself employed as the social secretary for a frivolous, ambitious, young actress named Delysia Lafosse.  Soon enough,Miss Pettigrew finds herself caught up in the frantic machinations of the actress and her social circle, as they struggle to attain starring roles, rich husbands, beautiful wives, fame, fortune, and whatever else that, to them, spells happiness.  The fact that Delysia has the habit of sleeping with different men puts her in an awkward situation that only Miss Pettigrew can help her with.  And thereby hangs the flimsy thread that serves as a plot for this silly trifle.    Interestingly, although ominous hints of an approaching World War II surround the characters--there are already gas masks hanging in department store windows--there is very little actual concern demonstrated from anyone; they're all too worried about their next move, and to what extent they will benefit.  Appearances aside, they're really pretty dreadful people.    As Miss Pettigrew, Frances McDormand is like an older, tireder Maria von Trapp, as she appeared in the first 20 minutes of \\"The Sound of Music\\" (though, thankfully, she doesn't sing).  She's exhausted by her penury but, unlike everyone else in the film, doesn't do much to improve her lot in life by, oh, applying some makeup or ditching the drab wardrobe, or attempting a little charm.  Even when her employer gives her a makeover, she's surprisingly dull and lifeless.  I suppose that's meant to convey a Mother Superior-like chasteness, to make us believe in Miss Pettigrew's moral superiority over her more earthy companions, but it just makes her seem unattractive and uninteresting.    As the actress, Delysia Defosse, Amy Adams has a luminous quality that shines through even this ill-gotten mess.  Her Delysia's speech has the cadence of machine-gun fire and she's got the total self-absorption of a pampered cat; she's a pretty, peppy, resourceful tart with no more depth than a paper doll.      Without exception, all the male characters are written as cuckholds or jerks (or both).  They're so one-dimensional that they barely exist; their onlyfunction seems to be providing the ladies with a place to hang their hats, if you will.  Lee Pace and Tom Payne, both young and handsome, are practically interchangeable as two of Delysia's suitors.  Their distinguishing traits are that the Pace character is poor and, therefore, has a pure love for Delysia, while the Payne character is rich, with, ultimately, less honest (and less pure) designs on the girl. Talented Ciaran Hinds is trotted out as fodder for Miss Pettigrew's well-hidden romantic yearnings, but he's no more believable than the rest of the cast.  Everyone in the considerably talented ensemble is totally wasted.    At least you'd think they'd make pre-war London look good, but the cinematography is murky, and the few shots we get of the city are skimpy, as if there wasn't enough money left over after paying the cast to create convincing street scenes.  I've seen PBS Mystery do a better job recreating an older London in the Miss Marple series than the filmmakers here do.     The people behind \\"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day\\" have assembled a lot of talent for their project, but they forgot to deliver a serviceable script, create believable characters, or to come up with anything that is, in any way, meaningful.  The sheer emptiness of this endeavor only serves to underscore the tremendous waste of talent, time, and money displayed here.
B000MTDRKE|5.0|the story:    I believe that Morse made this album because of the impact of what the story is about....i dont think he believes martin luther was right, but maybe because all religions are the way they are now because of luther...so why not tell about it....    the music:    i had a slight headache after i listen to the entire album in my car one day, this whole album is the intro to \\"author of confusion\\" time 50....all the way through....very heavy, very loud, great harmonies, great solos, tons of emotions...wish neal had broken it up into 12 or 13 small songs, rather than 3 monster 20 and 30 minutes songs, mostly because fast forwarding 27 minutes into a song to hear the ending is a little redundant after a while...    cant wait to hear the next album....

0525950079|1.0|I dislike being so very negative, but this book really has no redeeming features and I often found myself wondering if a very inadequate ghost writer had actually penned it.  Propelled by all the hype, WWE was chosen as summer reading fare for our book club, else I never would have finished it.  Insulting to the reader's intelligence, it is nothing more than a soap opera of the worst kind.  Another reviewer suggests that it could have been redeemed had it been subjected to the sharp knife of a good editor.  I say forget the sharp knife and use a kitchen mandoline to shred it into julienne strips.  The recycling bin is where it belongs.  Life too short to subject yourself to this type of shallow, poorly written fare.

Donna Summer you still make people dance!
0452289963|3.0|I liked the message of this book, but found it kind of hard to read.  I've read other books with a similar message that spoke to me much more clearly. He uses the phrase \\"or so to say\\" way too much.
0440238609|3.0|I thought just as a read it was great fun, mostly the first one, I didn't love the second two nearly as much as the golden compass. But they were still a fun read. But as an older reader I love the ideas of man, heaven, and god. When people say that this book is trying to insult religion and/or christianity don't take their word for it. I do not beileve that is what Pullman was trying to do, he wanted to make you think, and give us a new idea of what life and heaven might be, or mean to us. And he never quite says which side is right or wrong. I strongly suggest these books to anyone who likes to think or just a fun and interesting read!
B001ER4CSO|5.0|Guillermo Del Toro has become the new master of dark fantasy -- first with the quirky clockpunk \\"Hellboy,\\" then with the Oscar-winning \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans.<br /><br />Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is that it sticks to the formula of the demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. There's some retreading as Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is still able to spin a dark, twisted story with some truly bizarre creatures (the utterly alien, eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, trippy underground goblin markets and a new BPRD agent who is basically ectoplasm in a suit. And for the action scenes, Del Toro does not pull punches when it comes to the smashing action scenes -- giant thrashing vines and a one-on-one duel with Nuada are among the highlights.<br /><br />With all this going on, it would be easy to neglect the characters. But Del Toro packs the script with solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments -- including some pretty startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with Krauss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the \\"children of the Earth.\\" No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to vast rock monsters and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of \\"big Red\\" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still very much in the forefront, no matter how much human beings fear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. Pretty good villain, since he clearly isn't trying to be bad.<br /><br />The features on the fullscreen release appear to be pretty much identical to the widescreen, except for, y'know, the lack of visual width. There's audio commentary with Del Toro, Selma Blair, Luke Goss and Jeffrey Tambor, a series of mini-documentaries, and Del Toro's guidance through both deleted scenes and the creation of the amazing Troll Market. Also stills, production information, a comic book builder, and so forth. It's pretty good for the \\"bare bones\\" edition.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision.Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store.

0345494997|5.0|I have been an admirer of Frank Lloyd Wright and his works for over 20 years and have toured a number of his homes in Wisconsin and Illinois. I have also read accounts of his life including brief details about his relationship with Mamah Borthwick Cheney. For me, this novel portrays a realistic picture of Mamah, a woman quite ahead of her times, and the compelling and passionate reasons that pulled she and Wright together. The novel gives a loving account of the deep love and admiration they had for each other. Nancy Horan gives the reader a gentle and believable story of the intimate moments of their lives together, portrayed in their times as so \\"scandalous\\" and \\"tawdry.\\" This book is truly a loving dedication to both Borthwick and Wright.
B001675YQ6|5.0|Anyone who's in love with Breakfast at Tiffany's will simply love this movie which is at the same time a tribute and a light parody of the 1961 classic.<br />The story relates the twists and turns of love lives (absolutely separate!) of a struggling gay writer, a girl who dreams about true love and a group of their usually equally twisted friends. Their attempts at finding the one and only can be quite hilarious (Murphy's character Jacks is blind to the advances of Paolo who she thinks is gay and she goes as far as to get him on a blind date with Rhys' character) but the film manages to present them in a way which is both true and touching. A perfect light entertainment - don't miss it!
B0017OCII0|5.0|Forget all the food metaphors beckoning; I'd spend months trying to not sound cliche. But this book, especially in its similes, has language -- I'm not kidding about this -- that rivals Shakespeare's in creativity, and in its ability to evoke clear, luscious images. I read much of it out loud, letting the feel of the words in my mouth, their sounds in my ears, enhance the richness.     Thank you Ms. Harris, for the lessons, for the compassion, and especially for the language.
B00001OH7G|5.0|Ok,for the record this Rory Gallagher Album was titled Irish Tour '74 on it's initial release way back 34 years ago. A Live recording from his Irish Tour in 1974,the venues were Cork City Hall,Dublin and Belfast.I have in my possession the double vinyl on Polydor records which I bought way back in 1974 when I was merely a 14 year old kid(that makes me 45 now for all you matameticians out there,ha,ha).In fact when this album was first released on cd it's title remained Irish Tour but they dropped the year '74 and it came in a double cd format with the thicker box and much stronger than the present ones.It was released on intercord,Capo Records,but there is a track called Just A Little Bit which is not included on this new updated version.It had the exact same tracks as the Double vinyl otherwise but some of them are longer again that these ones.I also have that in my possession.Then I bought the Lets Go To Work Boxed Set and hey presto,it was also included in this brilliant set.I have bought this cd in 4 different formats,Why?Ok let me tell you why.Well firstly it reminds me of such a priveleged childhood I had where I could go and see Rory Gallagher perform every Christmas in Cork City Hall.It also reminds me so much of those great Summers when Rory was big news in the Music world.I'd buy the whole lot over again just to hear Walk On Hot Coals.It's astounding to listen and realise there's only one man playing what to me is the most amazing guitar solo i've ever heard.I love Tattoed Lady,Cradle Rock,and A Million Miles Away and Tony Joe Whites As The Crow Flies just as much.It is a great shame that Rory Gallagher was never really acknowledged here in Ireland(apart from a mediocre statue and plack name in Cork City.I was thinking more along the lines of replacing Father Matthew) let alone in The World,but then I suppose when you had long hair and were a musician here in Ireland in those days you were considered an outcast by all the powerful people like school teachers,priests,cops.Thank God for Donal Gallaghers persistence and love of his brothers music that we can still buy Rorys music and watch those amazing concerts on dvd now.This cd will change your musical tastes forever.Buy it now and re-invent yourself.

B000BTGY1O|5.0|This movie is an absolute must-see for anyone. It combines everything a classic should have - great actors (Audrey is tops and Peppard was never better), a great screenplay, a perfect score and New York (as usual) doing its best. The screenplay departs from the Capote's original but it does so in a way which makes the story work and which could be presented on the screen in 1961 - actually, the story is quite daring for the early 60s but you have to read between the lines every now and then to get it. Anyway, why shouldn't you reach for the original book once you are done watching?<br />In short - How does it look? I must say I'm amazed.<br />PS I wouldn't, however, recommend the movie to anyone who wants to quit smoking... ;)<br />PPS If you need more, you should also reach for Love and Other Disasters.

0765342294|5.0|This book is the first part of an astounding series of four books; Ender's game, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide and Children of the Mind. Although interesting, deep and often fun in itself, Ender's Game serves a greater role of introducing the child Andrew Wiggan, his sister and brother Valentine and Peter, and the concept of another rational (the books use \\"sentient\\") Alien Species, known unaffectionately as \\"The Buggers\\". Ender is a sensitive but brilliant young boy whose combination of intelligence and desperateness for survival, and extraordinary empathy make him invincible in any setting, physical attack, mind games whatever. And hence set him up to be the potential saviour of the the human race in their war to the death against the Buggers. But this book is really a lot like \\"The Hobbit\\" is to \\"Lord of the Rings\\", and establishes characters who are in the later books a vehicle for astounding ideas and insights ranging across science fiction, physics, religion, psychology, romance, courage and self sacrifice. With a few small tussles between good and evil thrown in. I feel certain that in 100 yrs after their writing these books will be considered a pinnacle of a style of literary creation. Get reading
B00166QJRU|5.0|and lovers of classic rock. It covers the actual beginnings of the Ziggy Stardust tours taking shape on stage with Bowie's first ever Los Angeles appearance. The band has a garage band sound yet tight as they ever were. Mick Ronson's guitar work glistens and delivers a one-two punch that made the whole ensemble of the Spiders From Mars a force to be reckoned with in the world of rock. Bowie himself masters the stage as you can hear the crowd yelling out song titles they want to hear. The opening is phenonmenal!! It starts with the strains of Beethovens 9th symphony as Mick is tuning up his guitar and then as quick as you can say \\"wham bam thank you m'am\\", the band crashes into the opening number, \\"Hang On To Yourself\\". Sheer ecstasy throughout the rest of the disc.

B0019X3ZZY|1.0|Badly written, badly acted, badly paced, this pretentious art-house nonsense has fooled (shocked?) many into thinking it has something to say.  Many reviewers have gone to great lengths (very, very great lengths in some cases) to paint this film as a masterpiece.  It's not.  Rife with symbolism and chocked full of metaphors, the movie is a condemnation of society as Pasolini saw it.  Okay, I \\"get\\" it -- but while the images are graphic and disturbing, ultimately it's the poorly conceived and executed film that is the biggest shock.  As a curiosity you might want to rent it.

B000NVIGC0|5.0|I love this CD. The first four songs blow me away. and then three more later on. Their lead guitarist is flat out great. Very creative and he can burn when he needs to but most is just fun listening to. Some songs I just listen for his leads. But Tweedy and his new songs are fantastic. Great little melodies and their simplicity raises them even higher. But they are creative and original as anything I've heard in a while. The rest of the band fills in wonderfully with the extra guitar and bass and drums. They really hit this one out of the park. Give a listen to Impossibly Germany and you'll buy.  Andy Waits

B000X5SPBI|5.0|Despite being the shortest season *Shakes fist at Writer's Strike* Supernatural is the only show on television that leaves me begging for more.   I have never been a Sci-fi fan (I'm a closet horror fan though *shrugs*) but this show, oh man, this show blows me away. The closeness of the brothers (Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are the two hottest actors on screen today) and the mythology are two of the biggest reasons why I watch this show.  Supernatural has something for everyone whether you enjoy it for the thrill, amazing cinematography, dialogue or eye candy.   Can't wait for Season 4!
B0017WI5VQ|4.0|I really like this CD. I listened to the entire thing on a rainy saturday afternoon and was quite pleased. I buy music based on what I like and I don't care if she sounds or doesn't sound like somebody else. I think her music is good on its own and that is all that matters. I am not really sure how to classify her music...it is kind of earthy. So forget about comparisions to other people and judge the music on its own merit.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|Nice little movie- funny, wacky multi-character farce in the grand tradition, but with modern references and situations. Well-written and acted. I was particularly captivated by the theme song, Love Our Time Today, variations of which run throughout the movie and make a pleasant background to the shenanigans of the cast. Give it a shot!
B00014TJ7K|4.0|Cloud Nine is a likeable album that's also slightly melancholic. The music is professionally-constructed adult pop that would sound great on a long car journey, and I have no doubt that George Harrison was thrilled with it, and that the album was exactly what he wanted. It's much poppier and less pretentious than Harrison's earlier work, and slightly less interesting because of it. There's absolutely nothing about Krishna consciousness, and he doesn't try to sing about the human condition, or the problems that face the world; the album is a collection of vague love songs, with the exception of \\"When We Was Fab\\", which is a parody of The Rutles.    Way back in the 1970s Harrison was often criticised for sticking to a formula. His songs tended to have gloomy minor-key mid-tempo arrangements with slide guitar. The slide guitar is still present in Cloud Nine, but the songs are generally upbeat and often cheerful, which would have been unthinkable circa 1973. His voice has matured well and it is a shame he didn't record it more often. As any fule kno, this was George's first record for ages, and his last record until he died; he hid in a tree and sniped the 1980s. Headshot.    None of the songs are bad. \\"That's What it Takes\\" sticks out, because it sounds like The Thompson Twins or Cutting Crew, but on that level it works well. Compared to something from All Things Must Past it is cheesy, but All Things Must Past was seventeen years old in 1987. Most of the people buying Cloud Nine would have no memory of it. \\"Got My Mind Set on You\\" is one of those guilty pleasures that works best in short bursts. I'll put it this way; if you were listening to the album in your car, you'd nod your head to \\"Got My Mind\\", and sing along, but you'd make sure that it was not playing when you pulled in to the driveway. You'd skip to \\"Fish on the Sand\\" or the title track, both of which are fab. In fact the title track is a grower, and has the best guitar playing of all.    The production hasdated, but well. It's definitely late-80s, but not cheesy late-80s, with the exception of some synth stabs on \\"This is Love\\". The drums reverberate in the Phil Collins style, and the arrangements are ultraprofessional and a bit fussy, but likeable. It's interesting to compare the album with Paul McCartney's Press to Play, which came out the year before. Conceptually, the two albums are similar; they are both big-budget late-80s pop records that were produced on huge automated digital mixing desks in top studios. Whereas Press to Play is offensively excessive, excessively offensive, tasteless, hollow, and smug, Cloud Nine is generally low-key, catchy, toe-tapping, tasteful, a bit shallow, but pleasant.    It's also interesting to compare Cloud Nine with David Bowie's Never Let Me Down, which came out the same year, but I am too tired for that.    In summary, Cloud Nine will never be on anybody's \\"ten best rock albums of all time\\" list, indeed it will probably never be on anybody's \\"ten best rock albums of 1987\\" list - it falls between too many stools - but I like it, and that's what counts.
0143144006|5.0|This book is not about strokes in general, but rather about this scientists experience. She writes very clearly and paints a wonderful picture of what was going on in her head during the stroke and recovery.

B001AHM2C6|5.0|Just like Christopher Nolan took everything he started with Batman Begins to new heights with The Dark Knight, composers Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard take the superhero film score to new heights as well.  From the creepily opening epic \\"Why So Serious?\\" to the tension-laced and hair raising \\"Always a Catch\\"; Zimmer and Howard have not only once again crafted a classic film score, but have raised the bar for superhero film scores, just as Nolan raised the bar for superhero films.  The real standout of The Dark Knight's score however is the emotional \\"Harvey Two-Face\\", which depicts the tragic fall of the heroic \\"white knight\\" Harvey Dent.  Other compositions, including \\"I'm Not a Hero\\", \\"Like a Dog Chasing Cars\\", \\"Agent of Chaos\\", and the grandoise closer \\"A Dark Knight\\" are masterpieces that are feasts of the ears.  All in all, the soundtrack to The Dark Knight is absolutely the best superhero score ever crafted, and like the film itself, will stand as a masterwork to be cherished and imitated for years to come.

Much of what is said is counter intuitve and as it turned out for us and our high need baby counter productive.

B000GIXEIG|5.0|Oral poems like Beowulf are extremely difficult to convert to dramatic media (plays, film, etc) because the plot is not arranged how we tend to expect (think boxes in boxes instead of the Freytag's Pyramid).  Additionally, oral poems tend to feature flat but mythic characters (the strong Beowulf or the clever Odysseus) rather than rounded human characters we can relate to.  For this reason and no other, most Beowulf movies stink.<br /><br />Not so with this one.  The movie adopts a standard superhero-type formula which is to make Grendel the sympathetic character gone bad, and use this to create an altogether human story full of moral questions relating to the value of mercy, justice, and other profound questions.  The story is thus immensely satisfying on a deep level.<br /><br />Additionally, the cinematography is well done and the Icelandic landscape beautifully shot.<br /><br />There are, of course, some areas which could have been improved.  I was not entirely satisfied with the acting and portrayal of the \\"Selma\\" character (not found in the original epic).  However, the other characters are well portrayed and the rest of the acting is good.
B0016Q56C4|5.0|This is a fun film that has enough excitement and action for anyone without any real violence to worry parents of small children - i.e., dinosaurs chase people, but never catch them.  There's a family-oriented story about a scientist (Brendan Fraser) spending time with his nephew (Josh Hutcherson) while continuing the work of the boy's missing father.  Establishing these characters and their developing relationship with fine acting, particularly by Hutcherson ([[ASIN:B000E6ES9E Little Manhattan]], [[ASIN:B00005JPL5 Bridge to Terabithia (Widescreen Edition)]]), makes the far-fetched sci-fi sequences that come later much easier to swallow.<br /><br />After they follow clues to a volcano in Iceland, the story gradually builds to more thrills, mostly taking advantage of the refined 3D medium without sacrificing the story for it.  There is a rail-car ride through a mine reminiscent of [[ASIN:B0014Z4ON4 Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Special Edition)]], but in my opinion better due to 3D.  There is a touching sequence in the middle to keep us grounded.  And there are several spectacular action sequences building up to the conclusion.  In my favorite sequence Hutcherson finds himself walking across huge boulders and rocks suspended by a magnetic field, hundreds of feet from the \\"ground.\\"  He must jump from rock to rock as you would in crossing a stream, but with a much scarier potential fall.  It's hard to do justice to this part in words; you have to see it. This part seemed very original and extremely well-suited to 3D.<br /><br />For fans of the old James Mason ([[ASIN:B00007JMD8 Journey to the Center of the Earth]]) film which was more of an adaptation of the classic Jules Verne novel ([[ASIN:1402743378 Journey to the Center of the Earth (Unabridged Classics)]], you can't really compare this one because it's story follows modern day characters, but assumes the events of the novel were true in the past.  I like both movies.<br /><br />Of all the 3D films I've seen, this is the best for several reasons - acting isn't sacrificed, the story stands alone, and the 3D is refined since a couple years ago.  I see 2 movies a week and so far this is my favorite of the year.<br /><br />Warning:  The above review was written for the theatrical release of the film.  Now that I've bought the DVD it turns out they did not use the same excellent 3D system on the DVD as in the theatres, which used a new kind of glasses.  With the DVD you get the same old cardboard glasses with red plastic for one lens, green for the other, and while the 3D effect still works ok, the color is much worse.for several reasons - acting isn't sacrificed, the story stands alone, and the 3D is refined since a couple years ago.

B00005JL78|4.0|\\"Minority Report,\\" like \\"Bladerunner,\\" is based on a Philip K. Dick story (although this time a short story). The plot revolves around a future where murders have almost been eliminated, thanks to a technology that allows the protagonist, John Anderton (played by Tom Cruise) to see into the future and stop a murderer before the act has been committed. The plot, which is excellent, is only half of the reason this film makes the list. The film resembles \\"Bladerunner,\\" in more ways than having been based on a Dick story; the world it takes place in is beautifully detailed and believable, one in which scanners on billboards read your identity and then produce a specialized advertisement just for you. The future portrayed is believable, both gritty and sleek, and the ethical questions raised by the film are especially poignant as we increasingly live a world were we are videoed, photographed, and observed on a greater, and greater level.

B00007L4MJ|4.0|Who would have guessed that a silent film from nearly a hundred years ago would still be one of the most poignant science fiction films ever created? Proving that story is more important than CGI, Metropolis delivers a stirring film that explores what it means to be human, and sets the stage for every robot/android/clone movie to follow (which happens to be all of them, this movie is so old!).<br /><br />Newer films hopped up on CGI explosions, gross out violence (I'm talking about you, Starship Troopers) but suffering inane writing should take some lessons from this classic. A movie doesn't need a 100 million dollar budget to be a success (or a massive failure, like Waterworld). What a movie needs is compelling characters who the viewer relates to, and a story that drives them forward. Metropolis has both.
0312427999|1.0|Well the book is written by an anti-American Marxist Canadian author with a long history of capitalism bashing. She's married to the newly hired anchor of Al-Jazeera terrorist network Avi Lewis. Scratch these guys and they bleed hatred for the western civilization. Marxism has influenced the author so much that she is blind to the miseries of marxism and communism. The book has no serious theory. It's all about contempt for what Capitalism has done. Though she is biased. She fails to mention the terrible result of Communism and socialism. She's a Canadian and one can't expect these jealous guys to do better. They hate America out of jealousy. I give this book a zero and its author should be ashamed of herself. Go live in Cuba or North Korea if you don't like capitalist system.
B00005JG6Q|4.0|Akira in many ways put Anime on the map, at least in the US, but is deserves to be recognized as more than a gateway film into the world of Anime. It is the classic post-apocalyptic setting, a story about what happens when science and teenage hormones run amuck. The film tells the story of a teenage motorcycle gang, and their troubled, latent psychic and second in command Tetsuo. It is an examination of diverse psychology, The Will To Power, corruption in various forms, and ultimately, sacrifice. The artistry of the animation is still amazing almost twenty years later, and the story is just as compelling now as it was then.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I have never written a movie review before, and after reading many reviews realized many people are in love with what they write..    I just watched the movie, had not even heard of it before my son had me sit down to view.  I turned on the surround sound, earphones on, and walked back thru time, as that brought back a flood of memories..  I thought it was a great movie, visuals, sound, singers, actors, it was all a well spent two hours.    Now I have to buy it, because it all worked for me.  May be a bit much for those that have young ones to watch, but for those with more mature offspring, it is good to have some dialog around the material.    This is a keeper for me.
B00012FXAE|5.0|Aliens, the sequel to Alien, is the best of the Alien quadrilogy, and is one of the most influential science fiction movies ever made. You can find references to this movie in sources as diverse as the film \\"Starship Troopers,\\" the PC game \\"Starcraft\\" and TV's \\"Battle Star Galactica.\\" In a three way tie with \\"Bladerunner,\\" and \\"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back,\\" for best science fiction film ever made, Aliens is a thrill ride with some of the most chilling visuals of any horror/science fiction film. Lt. Ripley is also one of the most memorable characters in any sci-fi movie or science fiction franchise. Aliens is so good, I can almost forgive Sigourney Weaver for her recent, ridiculously cheesy Direct TV commercial.

What sets this film apart is it's atmosphere, aided by near perfect art direction and spot on details. The new 5 DVD set, complete with a remastered HD version of the film that was created using the 4k original film reels, is simply a must have for any science fiction film fan.
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|A very good animated film, Bee Movie, brings to the screen the story of a young bee that refuses to accept having to choose a specific job and stick with it for life (which is the `bee way' of doing things). An unexpected arrival, however, will make him discover a world he had no idea existed...  Jerry Seinfeld, Renée Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, and the rest of the cast have done a good job with their performances, though they are by far not my favorite actors.   One thing was rather curious and that was how a specific small religious/ethnic group was mentioned in the movie for no apparent reason whatsoever except to promote it and possibly get the audience exposed to it and/or used to it... There seems to be quite a trend in the last few years. Hmmm...  Furthermore, enough with the openly and provocative anti-southern bias, as the `baddy' lawyer in a trial taking place in New York (!) is (of course) a southerner...  All right they lost, let's move on please! No need or reason to demonize them in the eyes of the new generations.  In short, it's the same old/usual cliché involving one of Hollywood's favorite villains/scapegoats: Southerners (it must have been really difficult to include Germans, Serbs, or Russians in this one).    Nevertheless, the movie is very well written and very well presented, and it will surely provide for more than just a few laughs.    The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the colors, the humor, and the music are all very good.  In short, Bee Movie is an entertaining movie definitely worth watching. Strongly recommended along with the Shrek and Ice Age movies, Antz, The Ant Bully, Cars, Flushed Away, Hoodwinked, Madagascar, Monsters Inc., Over the Hedge, and Ratatouille.

It is very clear and easy to read, it points out how far you can get by just using common sense (and how you can develop it if you haven't got it), includes basic design principles and human psychology as well as some pretty strong examples. It shows you how a usability test can be performed and talks about what you should focus on. I very much like the approach that there is no average user and not just one correct way to design a site. This book is of great value, a true classic and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the topic. It is so well layouted and designed that I don't need a marker to highlight anything!

006135323X|5.0|Today's mainstream economics is largely based on assumptions of rationality.  Ariely shows that such assumptions are completely wrong.  This has large implications for running an economic system that achieves a good life for people.  People are constantly trying to improve their lives by buying more \\"stuff,\\" but within very short time periods they find themselves dissatisfied again.  The most common measure of economic prosperity used by mainstream economists is the GDP--which essentially counts up what people spend on stuff.  Is it any wonder that GDP statistics do not correlate well with quality of life?  No economist can afford to miss reading this book.  For more on this, see [[ASIN:0300091060 The Loss of Happiness in Market Democracies]] and [[ASIN:0807047090 Beyond Growth: The Economics of Sustainable Development]].<br /><br />One of Ariely's fascinating findings is that most people would not steal money directly from someone else, but that if the fact that one is stealing is disguised even slightly, most people will do it. This principle is in my opinion why pollution, deforestation, and exhaustion of resources are so difficult to control.  We wouldn't steal a fisherman's wallet, but dumping a half-gallon of chemicals in a stream seems different to us, even if the effect on the fisherman's income is the same.<br /><br />I was especially intrigued by Ariely's analysis of the power of \\"free\\".  Ariely doesn't mention this, but free parking is a fantastic example.  One form of destructive government subsidy that many people don't know about is local regulation requiring the provision of certain numbers of parking spaces around businesses and residences.  Most American localities have such regulations, which are known as parking requirements.  The idea behind parking requirements is to make sure that free parking is always available.  Unfortunately, the effect is to favor automobile travel over other forms of transportation, like walking, that don't require all that vehicle storage space. It's a form of enforced inefficiency.  U.S. building codes also favor the automobile in other ways, such as by requiring very wide streets.  Parking requirements are one of the main reasons why housing is so expensive in the U.S.  The cost of parking requirements in the United States is in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year. For more on this, see Donald Shoup's book [[ASIN:1884829988 The High Cost of Free Parking]].rage space. It's a form of enforced inefficiency.

B0014637HC|1.0|I'm not criticising Michael Jackson here, and the fact that there are no commentaries on these film clips or interviews with Michael, he probably has no idea this con job of a DVD collection was even released.<br /><br />The whole problem and feeling that I was ripped off comes from the fact that they do not mention on the packaging anywhere and especially with the track listing, that these film clips on here are either not the versions played on TV in the 80s etc, or if they are, they have been severely edited with huge chunks cut away. There's a few still in their original version including his (and music's) greatest film clip of all time Thriller.  What's going on with the rest though?  If they need room get rid of the fillers like Blood on the Dance Floor (a song so bad even Michael struggles to dance to it and spends most of the film clip sitting on a chair).<br /><br />They should have listed the tracks that aren't the real or full versions with brackets such as with Smooth Criminal (crappy low budget doesn't resemble in any way the one you remember version) Bad (shorter starts half way though actual film clip), Black and White (controversial vandalism of car, panther turning into scenes not included) etc  If they were honest and did this only the hardcore Michael Jackson fans who already have the other longer film clip versions would buy this so they have these alternative versions. The rest of the public who expect the same version they saw on their TV screens back in the 80s and so forth wouldn't feel ripped off.  Everyone would be happy!<br /><br />Of course if the record company actually did that they'd make less money, but that would have been the moral thing to do.<br /><br />If you can get this for $2 or something and you don't plan on getting other Jackson DVDs, it's worth getting just for Thriller. The sheer rehearsals and shooting takes it would have taken to make that masterpiece with all the zombies choreography exactly in line, leaving the ground at the same time etc is phenomenal.

B00099I66W|5.0|In Billy Wilder's SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950) a superb cast, story and cinematography combine to make a film noir classic. This was one of the first selected for preservation by the National Film Registry, and is #16 on the American Film Institute's list of 100 best American movies.<br /><br />It's the story of a young man who falls under the control of an aging former silent-era starlet. When she realizes that Joe Gillis (Holden) is a screenwriter, Norma Desmond (Swanson) asks him to polish the script for her imagined \\"comeback\\" movie. Along the way, he becomes financially dependent on the older lady, who quickly falls in love with him. On New Year's Eve Gillis rejects Desmond's advances, eventually gets involved with another woman and tragedy ensues.<br /><br />Erich von Stroheim is excellent as Miss Desmond's butler. The supporting cast also includes Cecil B. DeMille (as himself); he directed Miss Swanson in several silent features, starting with 1919's \\"Don't Change Your Husband.\\" Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper portrays herself, as well. Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson have bridge-playing cameos.<br /><br />Also directed by Billy Wilder, [[ASIN:1558807780 DOUBLE INDEMNITY]] (1944) starring Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edw. G. Robinson, is another superlative example of the film noir genre. (VHS edition)<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 viewer poll rating found at a film resource website.<br /><br />(8.7) Sunset Boulevard (1950) - William Holden/Gloria Swanson/Erich von Stroheim/Nancy Olson/Fred Clark/Jack Webb/Cecil B.

B001AW9DKK|4.0|Ever since this legendary band reformed in 1999 it has very much been with Neil Young at the steering wheel. He has chosen the backing bands and he has vetoed any official releases from their prevoius, highly succesful tours, in 2000 and '02.<br /><br />This isn't a proper livealbum either, but the soundtrack to his film about the band's \\"Freedom Of Speech\\" tour in '06, promoting Neil's \\"Living With War\\" album.<br /><br />Where the tour was a mix of new and old songs, and the 30+ songlist somewhat equally shared between the four great songwriters, here it's all Neil, with 9 out of 16 songs being from \\"Living..\\", while the other three have to share the remaining 7. That Neil is by far the most succesful through the years, commercially and mediawise, hardly justify such a malproportion. And although I can wholeheratedly agree with Neil's poignant lyrics about War, Iraq and Mr. Bush, the musical qualities of his new tunes are more dubious.<br /><br />The highlights of the CD is undoubtly the fine versions of the classics \\"Deja Vu\\" and \\"Wooden Ships\\", where it sounds like a band and where we get some of the famous twin leadguitar interplay between Neil and Stephen Stills.Whereas CSN is hardly audible through the new Neil songs. It's also on the classic tracks that the impeccable backing musicians really gel, not least the fine bassplayer Rick Rosas and drummer Chad Cromwell.<br /><br />As evidenced by their recent collaborations with David Gilmour (\\"Island\\" and the live-DVD) David Crosby and Graham Nash are in topform vocally, whereas Stephen isn't, he doesn't even sing on his own \\"Find The Cost Of Freedom\\", but plays some fine guitar - when he's allowed to step out that is.<br /><br />But else it's all Neil, and he's certainly in great form through out.<br /><br />A fine release by one of the all-time greatest bands, though I personally would have preferred a whole show.

I usually play it with my young brothers, whose ages are (6,10 and 13). they all enjoy it, since it is easy to play and has lots of strategy. every time we play it, we learn more about strategy.

159102594X|5.0|I loved this bok from the first 25 pages until the very end. It left me DYING to get the next one. I cannot recommend this highly enough.
031606792X|1.0|SPOILERS HEREIN!!!  First let me say that I set aside my sociopolitical objections to the limited goals Meyer set up for girls in the first three books, and I was able to enjoy them quite a bit. But here, Meyer broke all the rules of story construction, and the results are incredibly disappointing. Evidently Stephanie Meyer didn't like the restrictions she had imposed on herself. She didn't like the mythology she had created for vamps, because she certainly didn't stick to them when they boxed her in in BD.  She didnt like Bella's human limitations, because those all went out the window when she needed to be flawless.  She didn't like the sacrifices Bella would have to make to live as a vampire, because those flew to the four winds when they became inconvenient. She had her family, her memory, her heart, her best friend, her self-control, and a daughter. Hmm.  Weren't the first three books about how EVERY ONE of those things would be lost to her if she became a vampire?  Doing my best to forget the ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC role model Bella provided before, the girl in this book is likely the most damaging character to which young girls have been exposed since, well, ever.  Not only does Meyer seem to encourage girls to a)worship a guy  b)marry and [presumably] give up EVERYTHING for that guy (though MEyer's final book made that handily unnecessary) and c) become a teenage mother,  but now I am convinced she is encouraging young girls to wish they could actually become the undead. Oddly, I am more upset about the breaking of all the rules of writing and construction than the terrible pre-victorian life she suggests for Bella. YOU created the stinking world, MEYER! Shame on you for not living within the restrictions of your own creation.  Where was your freaking editor? He/She should be tarred and feathered alongside you.
B00003CXCD|5.0|It is hard to read some of these reviews and not scratch one's head. To think, for example, that Cary Grant would have been better in this film is crazy.  Cary Grant is a knowitall sophisticate.  He would have wrecked the film.  The whole point of the film is that everyone is innocent and learning how to be truly noble as adults.  Only Gregory Peck could have carried off the male role without making him appear naive or an idiot.  All the sexuality in it is very, very carefully dealt with -- one false move, and it would have crashed and burned.  The film is about restraint and duty.     It was Audrey Hepburn's best film.  The final scenes -- so understated, but speaking volumes -- are brilliantly acted.  Of course, nobody would behave like these two now.  And of course we are so much better off. Sure we are.
1593082010|5.0|It has been one of my favourites for years. Wheather you have read the other Jane Austen books or not, this is a \\"must read\\". This edition is really good and comfortable (in size, type size, etc.) to read and carry along for bus/ train travelling. Good to read and then watch the film.
B0017XOF5A|4.0|The Stargate Continuum was just what you would expect from the Stargate SG-1 franchise.  I would say it rates as well as the other episodes.  It is by no means better than any of the other episodes and is not theater bound.  Why they did not just show this as a normal episode of Stargate SG-1 I will never know.      It seems a little late coming out since it is set before the encounters and battles with the Ori.  This seems to fit somewhere at the end of season 8 and before season 9 where the Ori are introduced.  Just to be clear, no Ori in this movie just Goa'uld.  Good purchase if you are a Stargate SG-1 fan.
031606792X|5.0|\\"Bella didn't have to sacrifice anything apparently. She gets Edward AND a baby AND immortality as a vampire. What about poor Jake--not a problem, he IMPRINTS on the baby, which I find disturbing not so much because it is a baby (though that is creepy just as it was with Quil) but because it's Edward and Bella's baby. Can we say cop out? Life doesn't turn out so neatly. People love and lose (and don't fall for the object of their affection's daughter). But in Meyer's world everyone is one big happy family.\\"    Bella did sacrifice to get what she wanted - that's the point. She gave up her mortality (and if Edward's right, her SOUL), and she gave up a normal life. The very fact that she gets immortality, Edward, and a baby whom Jacob imprinted on PROVES the point that she gave up a normal life.     And maybe you can view Jacob's imprinting as a cop-out; maybe you can see it as creepy. That's your opinion. I think I'd like to remind you all that Quil imprinting on Claire? Yeah, that's not romantic, like Jacob's on Nessie isn't romantic. The girls are too young; therefore the wolves don't see them that way. They act like the girl's best protectors/brothers/friends in the world, and that has no hint of romantic interest. The romance comes when the GIRLS are old enough. It's not like that yet.     I like to go with what Bella said, on the subject of Jacob, in that she thought things \\"got messed up along the way\\" and now they're finally set right. The fact that Jacob imprinted on Nessie was the reason he needed to be around Bella the entire time. He needed to be there for the eventuality of Nessie. Have you heard of fate? I think I like the fate factor in this set-up: if it weren't for Jacob, Nessie wouldn't be. If it weren't for Nessie, Jacob wouldn't have been there.     Also, life is depressing enough with George W. Bush as our president. Who wants to read a story with a depressing ending on top of that living hell? I look to reading as an escape from reality, not the continuation of it.    So, girls don't worry. If you have problems, they will ALL work out. Is that what the author wants to tell her fans?    Oh, yes. Bella didn't have to struggle at ALL. Bella didn't have to give up her mortality, or face the prospect of DYING because Edward might have killed her when he changed her. She certainly didn't face hardship and struggle - \\"New Moon\\" ring any bells? - and of course, she never ONCE wondered if she wouldn't get her happy ending. She certainly NEVER struggled with a REAL problem, like confusion between her feelings for two boys.    I consider this the most ridiculous over-generalizing statement. Bella does have her problems. She has real problems set in a fantasy world. And I certainly don't read the books and say, \\"Gee, this in this fiction book everything turned out perfectly. I bet my life is going to be perfect too.\\" That's just plain stupid.     \\"Or is it marriage and family by 18 are the way to go, forget about college, developing as a person, all you need is a husband and a child.\\"    So...being a teenage slut, going out and sleeping with boys instead of choosing to stay in a solid relationship - we SHOULD be looking up to that instead? That's what the celebrities we admire right now advertise. That's what every girl sees in the media - sluts and other various bad things - so why in the world do you complain about a girl who is choosing to actually get married and have a family `the right way'?    \\"No disrespect to people who marry at 18, but Meyer paints a glorified picture of the situation; most 18 years old aren't going to have an endless supply of money and never worry about how the lack of an education will affect their future.\\"    And...OBVIOUSLY normal eighteen-year-olds don't get married or have endless supplies or money, or think about the lack of education. Are we forgetting that this is set in a fantasy world, where they are vampires with all the time in the world? That's not a normal situation; it's a fiction book. That's why they have the money and lack of education: in THEIR world, it doesn't apply. I think that everyone outside of their world - namely, in real life - has a better grasp of reality when they're eighteen. And if they don't...well, then our world is definitely more messed up than it already is.     \\"Yes, this is a novel, a fantasy, we shouldn't expect or require realism--then why go the mommy route at all? Just focus on Bella and Edward. Bella didn't want children, yet when she finds out she's pregnant she doesn't even freak out; she's carrying a vampire's child and it's just \\"my heart had grown, swollen up to twice its size in that moment.\\"    \\"Going the mommy route\\" is another component of that happy-life image that EVERY woman, regardless of age or even year of birth, is exposed to. Everything in our lives - from way back in history to the present day - says that girls should want to be mothers. Everything. Why are you picking on one book?     Bella might not have wanted children - but isn't that also realistic, that women who don't particularly want children end up pregnant sometimes? And isn't it also REALITY that these women - more often than not - also end up loving their children? And just because Bella didn't scream or throw a tantrum or start sobbing doesn't mean she didn't freak out. Instead of acting out about her fear, she internalized it. That's the character she is: that's the person SM created. And she loves Edward - if a woman found out she was pregnant by the man she truly loved, and she was already MARRIED to him, is it really so far out of the realm of reality to consider that she would love the baby, too?     \\"Or is the author's message be passive and let others take care of you (what if there is no one else--no, no, girls, there is ALWAYS someone).\\"    I don't see how Bella let anyone take care of her. She was determined to be herself, all the time. Edward left, she was heartbroken. Yes, that was extreme depression. And she leaned on Jacob - her FRIEND, and don't people who are heartbroken usually lean on their FRIENDS? I think that she became stronger after \\"New Moon\\" - let's imagine, for a moment, that you've lost the love of your life, he said he didn't want you, you're depressed for a long time, and suddenly you have him back.     This would destroy most people. They would refuse to take their love back - or they would take them back, and become different people. Either way, they wouldn't be the same person anymore. I saw no change in Bella: she was the same strong character. She knew who she was, and she knew what she wanted. She's always known that she wants Edward - what's wrong with that? What's wrong with needing a person in your life? Humans are naturally social creatures: we need to trust at least some people in order to feel complete in and of ourselves. That's how we are. So...what's the problem with this, again?     \\"One of my big issues with the series is how Bella has never had outside interests beyond Edward (or Jake), that she's not an independent person.\\"    So, what? It's better to be boy-crazy? How is that a better message to send to young girls?     And Bella has always been an independent character. She's never fit in with people and knows it, but that doesn't make her lock herself away. Instead, she stays pleasant and kind, instead of internalizing anger and becoming vindictive because she doesn't feel like she can fit in. She knows her mind, and she knows what she wants. Even the big, scary vampire can't make her think anything differently. Whether Edward is teasing her or genuinely being scary, she isn't afraid of him - because she loves him and she knows it. She is strong-minded and strong-willed.     \\"Don't even get me started on Bella's power.\\"    Her mind was strong - I've already said that. And Bella is a naturally protective person - she always worries about others, always wants to keep them safe. I think her ability to shield her family and friends, her loved ones, from the danger that the Volturi represent is a wonderful way to show physically what she feels emotionally.    \\"Also, the explanation of why Edward can get Bella pregnant is ridiculous considering the rules Meyer originally established for her world.\\"    My theory, as presented to a reviewer who asked for it:     First of all, it's been cleared that SM made the point to say it was female vampires that could not have children, and that most bodily fluids were replaced with venom. Therefore, I thought that if the venom didn't replace the semen, it must have simply changed it somehow. Carlisle and Jacob had that talk in the book, about the differences between vampire, werewolf and human physiology, and that vampires have twenty-five chromosomes, werewolves twenty-four, and humans twenty-three. Therefore, something did get changed in vampire DNA when they were transformed. This means that the semen would be different from human, which was why Carlisle thought that Bella and Edward wouldn't be compatible and didn't think to warn them. However, that obviously wasn't the case and therefore, Renesme came to exist - a half-vampire, half-human hybrid, because of the non-matching chromosomal pairs between them somehow combining in just the right genetic way to create a baby.    Does that clear it up?    \\"The best fantasy, horror, and science fiction stories all have a morality/deeper element to them. Fairy tales, as they were originally designed, were meant to teach children a valuable lesson. This does not (and should not) lessen the entertainment value of a story, but I think it's a cop out to say \\"it's a fantasy,\\" as if that excuses anything. If you look at Lord of the Rings, The Hero and the Crown, The Phantom Tollbooth, The Last Unicorn, Harry Potter, Stoker's original Dracula novel, The Prydain Chronicles, The Little Prince--all of them deal with themes of sacrifice, choice, gaining wisdom, growing as a person, and/or are thought provoking/contain deeper messages.\\"    And the Twilight saga doesn't have meaning to it? What about the ever-universal `love', `loss' and `gain', and `sacrifice', `choice', `knowledge', `growth'? Oh, wait; are most of those listed there? And let's add `fate' and `betrayal' to that list.     Love is shown Bella's feelings for Edward; how there is more than one type of love in the world; how one can struggle to deal with two loves at once; friendship, family, romantic, maternal, paternal, for a sibling, for a parent...    Loss is resolved with gain, showing that good things can happen to good people. In real life, good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people more often than good on good and bad on bad, but it is possible.     Sacrifice - well, Bella sacrificed, didn't she? She knowingly chose to give some things up, and it's not her fault that some of those things came back to her. But overall, she did let some things go - the most important being her humanity. She's no longer human. What would motivate a person to give up their humanity? What can make a person do that? And what kind of things would make a human in real life give up their humanity - not in an `I'm a vampire' way, but in the ways that create rapists and serial killers, people like Hitler? That's giving up humanity, too - how can we compare Bella to them? I consider that a deeper meaning, something to think deeply about. Because, plain and simple, she gave up being human.     Choice goes along with sacrifice, as does knowledge. And growth ties in to loss, as well as knowledge. Let's not forget fate: Jacob was there for Nessie, and if it weren't for Jacob, Nessie might not be there. Edward was changed into a vampire at seventeen, and if he hadn't he'd never have met Bella.     And fate also goes with betrayal - if James and his coven never came to Forks, Laurent would never have met Irina. The Denali coven wouldn't have stayed away from the battle involving the werewolves. Irina wouldn't have come and seen Nessie, and gone to the Volturi.     All these interconnecting ideas that I associate closely with the book are proven in the actions written on every page. The Twilight sage has meaning - you look for it, like you would any other book. Let's see \\"Harry Potter\\" for a moment - many people seem to think it's evil or something along those lines. That's a bit more extreme than saying it has no substance, but it's the same root point: they say there's no meaning to it, that it's there for one thing only.     Well, isn't that what you're saying about the Twilight series, or at least \\"Breaking Dawn\\", by writing it off as something that is mere fluff and for-the-masses?
B0018QCXGY|1.0|Want to watch a 19 something bunch of kids run around Manhattan with no clue, no acting ability and 5 minutes of good CGI.  Well then you will love Cloverfield.  This is the first movie I have wanted to pluck my eyes out over.  This sucked SO BAD.  I watched it for some redeeming qualities and found NONE (except when it ended; sweet relief).  Don't even waste your time if someone gives it to you for free (they are just trying to get rid of the worst movie ever).  Not even worth a look at $0.99 rentals.  At least with Netflix it was not the only movie I got...
0307265730|4.0|I am typically not a fan of short stories as I find the development of the characters lacking and just as you develop a relationship (of sorts) the story is cut and the next begins.    Unaccustomed Earth was an exception. The stories are neither complex or heavily worded but simple and straight-forward. The theme continues through the book with some stories being tied together to form a whole.    While I certainly do not believe her stories tell the tale of all Indian existence in the US or abroad I appreciate them for what they are and how beautifully they are shared with the reader.    I could not put the book down: an enjoyable read.
031606792X|4.0|SM tied all of the loose ends up quite tidily for us. This didn't really bother me execpt that we never found out about poor Leah. SM created the beginning of an interesting relationship between Leah and Jacob, and began to develop Leah's character but then just sort of dropped it and we were left somewhat in the lurch with her. Having said that, I think that both Breaking Dawn and Eclipse would have been improved with the talents and red pen of a good editor. If SM does decide to revisit the story from Edward's point of view, I hope that she waits a couple of years so that she gains perspective and that she will elicit the expertise of a consructive but frank and honest editor. I thought that the first two books were the best, but the series as a whole is worth reading and I did appreciate the fact that we got to see the world from Bella's perspective as a vampire. Great fun and a page turning good read!
6305692572|5.0|This subdued but tender and gut-wrenching look at two people who desperately love each other but find their marriage unravelling because of the bottle has two genuinely moving performances from Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan. At first quietly touching, and as it progresses, ultimately heartbreaking, it is like watching a terrible car crash in slow motion. You can't take your eyes away from the screen because you must know the fate of the family inside.<br /><br />Written by Ronald Bass and Al Franken, the beautiful photography of Lajos Koltai is in contrast to the sad music score of Zbigniew Preisner, highlighting the difference between appearances and the real picture just beneath the surface. Director Luis Mandoki begins the film in romantic fashion but soon peels back the layers to expose a marriage in deep trouble.<br /><br />Andy Garcia is amazingly good in an understated performance as a husband very much in love with a wife who has become a liitle too drunk a little too often. A pilot for a major airline, he has all the trappings of happiness. Two adorable little girls and a nice home, however, can offer no magic answers when he sees the woman he loves sliding and is at a loss what to do to stop it. Like any husband, Michael Green wants to fix things but can't admit he doesn't know how.<br /><br />Meg Ryan is flawlessly genuine as his wife, Alice Green. A trip to Mexico to ease the supposed pressure prompting her to drink too much only puts a spotlight on how far she has fallen when a tragedy nearly occurs. But it is a moment alone with her oldest daughter which will finally force her into a treatment center. Rather than cliches, this film shows there are no easy answers. Michael is disquieted then shocked at just how much the children saw and knew about their mother's problem. Things of which he himself was unaware.<br /><br />The underlying problems still remain when she returns and tries to readjust and you can truly feel the frustration of the coulple. Finally separating, Garcia is truly magnificent in scenes with the two young girls from Ryan's previous marriage he considers his own. Meg's finest moment in the film comes near the end and should have put her into Oscar contention. Tina Majorino as their older daughter and Lauren Tom as their babysitter deserve mention as well. Quietly played performances with the thoughtful intelligence you see more often in foreign films seemed to work against the picture's stars in this regard.<br /><br />This film is ultimately about love and is quite romantic. It is a mature romance, however, devoid of pretense and not seen through rose colored glasses. A beautifully conceived drama which leaves a lasting impression on the heart and a film everyone should see.ificent in scenes with the two young girls from Ryan's previous marriage he considers his own.

B000VNMMWA|5.0|Like a little Hot Fuzz with your extras?  This edition is loaded with them.  So much Pegg, Frost and Wright that you may overdose and be sent to comedy rehab where they won't let you flush cake or shop at Sheppler's.  My favorite gem in this lot is Edgar Wright's first cop film, Dead Right.  Made in 1993 on VHS, its Dirty Harry meets Lethal Weapon meets Rushmore which all builds to a fantastic climax of box monsters and a misunderstood cereal killer (yes, cereal killer).  I'm so glad I pried open my wallet and shelled out the 30 bucks.

0691126658|5.0|Confronted by only one serious contender for the distinction of best field guide to the birds of East Africa, the Terry Stevenson/John Fanshawe entry wins by default.  In featuring each descriptive summary and range map on a page facing the corresponding species illustration, the organization of the book qualifies it as a true field guide.  While the field guide edition of \\"Birds of Kenya and Northern Tanzania\\" by Zimmerman, Turner, & Pearson incorporates several superior attributes, frequently including quality and variety of illustrations, it is essentially a condensation of a larger work and not organized in field-guide format.  In covering a wider geographical area, the Stevenson/Fanshawe guide describes nearly 300 more species depicted on over twice as many color plates.  Both of these fine books are potentially very useful for birding in Kenya and Tanzania, with the organization of the true field guide more likely to enhance its potential usefulness to those just beginning to appreciate the splendid avian diversity of East Africa.

B000YAA68W|5.0|I do not believe I have ever seen such a deep and touching animation movie - this is an absolute wonder and it treads in a domain which is difficult to explain and hard to understand - Iran (not Arab), Europe, the culture, the cultural classes, religion, politics - can it be any more complicated - but Vincent Paronnaud, Marjane Satrapi have been able to simplify all these complex issues into a simple story as seen through the eyes of the protagonist Marjane Satrapi. I feel very strongly about this probably because I have gone through many similar experiences (with different background) so when I was watching the movie , the truth in it almost made me cry.<br />We are used an Iran depicted by CNN and George Bush Administration but this is a very narrow and politicized view of Iran - Persia as a country has an enormous cultural roots and strong social fabric which the islamic rulers cannot destroy so easily and we also forget to realize that Islam (speacially the persian version) was not aggressive or brutal  infact they gave us Rumi. Thye movie shows an amazing transformation of Iran through the last century - this transformation has never been produced so lucidly anywhere. It also shows that the subcultural of this liberal front in Iran has not died (not yet) and it still can germinate back again. The protagonist see the revolution (where Shah is removed), the war with Iraq - see gets support from her liberal grandma who represents the subculture of liberalism which never died. This movie probably shows the biggest difference between Iran and Arab nations (like Saudi) - most of the time we lump Iran in the same category with Arab nations but Persia was completely a different world.<br />Then when the protagonist moves to Europe for her studies - she faces the challenges of cultural differences and her inner battle of identity crisis - this depiction is poetic it is almost like somebody is reading from Albert Camus - sometimes the inner demons wins but finally she overcomes the hurdles and moves forward - the movie ends with an ray of hope - it shows that Iran can get back its own identity which is different from the Islamic identity.<br />Finally it brings out a potrait of the women of Iran - they can fight their own battle and do not need western sympathy - they understand their plight and they are involved in a struggle to change it - hope they can change - I have decided to buy this DVDthe hurdles and moves forward - the movie ends with an ray of hope - it shows that Iran can get back its own identity which is different from the Islamic identity.   Finally it brings out a potrait of the women of Iran - they can fight their own battle and do not need western sympathy - they understand their plight and they are involved in a struggle to change it - hope they can change - I have decided to buy this DVD

B000F6IOBQ|4.0|Underworld- Evolution  If you are a fan of classic Werewolf and Vampire movies, you need to be open minded coming into this movie. Not all werewolves and vampires need to have the same characteristics. This is a great movie in its own right. The movie is an action flick, not a horror movie. I will say that watching the [[ASIN:B0001WTUH6 original Underworld]] would probably help you understand this movie more. They give you a good back story in the beginning, but I didn't feel like it was enough.    Selene is a Vampire that is being hunted down. In the previous movie she killed their Vampire lord, Victor. Victor had started the war with the werewolves, known as Lycans in this movie. Selene learned the truth and saved a man named Micheal from sure death. Micheal is the only hybrid of both Lycans and Vampires. Victor wanted no leaps like that and wanted to kill Micheal. Now, Victor has been killed and the search is on for his killer.    Selene must now awaken Markus, another vampire elder, to see the treason of Victor and help her. Markus, however, is already awaken. Blood of a Lycans dripped into his tomb and he is now a Hybrid himself. He is one of the most powerful beings in the world. Markus has his own agenda in finding his brother, William. William is the first werewolf, much like Markus is the original vampire. William was hidden away in a tomb somewhere that Markus could never find. William was out of control and killing everything.    Selene, as it turns out, is the only person who knows the location of the tomb. Her family helped build it when she was only a child. She can't remember it precisely, but if Markus drinks her blood he will learn all her secrets. Now, the hunt is on.    This sequel features a lot less gun fights. Instead it opts to use actually fighting sequences. While the are done well, I personally preferred the gun fights. Still, some of the fights are awesome. Markus and Micheal battling on the back of a moving truck is insane.    Markus is agreat villain. He is powerful, but has good intentions. He wants to save his brother. Soon his intentions shift though. He wants to create a new race in his hybrid image. He is becoming mad with power. This evolution of character really works for me.    The actors are all top notch. There are some really good British actors that flesh out the dialogue very well. These actors really make the Underworld series what it is. Markus is played so well it is mad. Also, Tenus is plays his weasel character very well.    The extras on this DVD are pretty good. I didn't really like the commentary track. It was informative, but one of the guys speaking had an accent that was extremely hard to understand. There is a bunch of making of features and a awesome music video, Her Portrait in Black by Atreyu. Good extras for a normal release.    The gore in this movie is pretty good. You see blood squirting, heads smash off, and top jaws being ripped off. While that all sounds crazy, the gore never seems to over the top. You never question how realistic it looked. It all looks amazing.    One true problem I had with the movie is that my favorite character, Craven, is killed within in the beginning of the movie. Still, I won't take off points for that because the movie was good enough with out him. Still, I miss Craven.    If you are looking for a good action movie, check this one out. If you are looking for a repeat of the last werewolf/vampire movie you saw, go see something else. The acting is great and the extras are nice. Still, I preferred the first movie over this one.
B00005JOFQ|1.0|Didn't care much for the movie. I think that the only thing that I enjoyed watching was the backgound settings. There was no \\"chemistry\\" as they say where Heath Ledger was concern. At times he looked like he was really uncomfortable with the role. Like you could tell that he wasn't really gay. Jake on the other hand, was really into the character role. Overall, I didn't like the entire movie. I was expecting more.
B00005JPTK|5.0|This was bought as Christmas gift so it's not been given to person yet. But it was on their list so sure they will enjoy it. Really I can't wait so I can borrow it once they have watched it. Love anything Will Smith is in. I'm sure it's great.
031606792X|1.0|The book was great according to my son but the condition of the book was horrible. The binding was falling apart and when I tried to find out how to return it the web page that explains returns on amazon was not functioning (imagine that) for 3 days I tried. There is no phone number or email address to get any customer service from amazon. I had never tried to contact them before this and was disgusted in my attempts so I decided to keep the damaged book and never order from amazon again. Disgruntled customer.
B00064AM6C|3.0|I love the White Stripes, and have since they first came out when some weirdo at a bar gave me a demo.  I have been to see them live twice and was consistently blown away at their live performance.  So why the low score on this review?  Meg and Jack were spot on as always, unfortunately this video both looks and sounds as if it were shot on a cell phone.  Now I was okay with the grainy video, I know they are an anti-establishment band and the grainy look goes with their vibe.  It would have been nice had it been inter cut with some higher quality shots so that we could actually see both Jack and Meg, specifically since they are such wonderful entertainers.<br /><br />My biggest problem is with the sound, it's the tinny metallic sound of someone recording without being plugged into the sound board.  The same as if you were to take a camera to the concert and record it yourself, the quality just isn't there.  Sadly I couldn't listen though this from beginning to end because the terrible sound made Jack sound as if he was mumbling and the guitar just sounded terrible, I ended up with a migraine rather than a fun evening of dirty Detroit rock.  If you didn't already know the words to his music, you certainly won't be able to pick them out on this DVD.<br /><br />I love the band, and had really high hopes for this DVD, unfortunately I am very happy that I rented rather than purchased.  True all of their great songs are included on the DVD, they just don't sound any good.  And since you can't really make out what they are doing due to the grainy video, you really can't get into the vibe of it all.  I hope that their next DVD will be more professionally produced, because if this had sounded half as good as their live show I would have bought it directly.<br /><br />For now stick with the CDs.

B000RZGIQ8|2.0|I have now owned this movie on VHS, DVD, and now BD.  Unfortunately, the copy from the masters is rather grainy for HD.  The audio is outstanding, but again, while it obviously looks better than a DVD, this might be one of the worst BD's I've seen since they came out.  I know that the masters are 20 years old, but the BD of Halloween looks AMAZING, and that movie is 30 years old.  I must admit that I had high hopes, and was a little dissapointed.  My reccomendation would be wait until they release the \\"Special Edition,\\" which I'm sure they undoubtedly will.      Side note: extras are all in SD.
0688014291|5.0|Back in 1981, I was a first line supervisor for a large steel company. As an organization, we were struggling against the competition coming from Japan dumping large volumes of low quality, low price steel on our shores.  Our management team bought everyone a copy of the new book, The One Minute Manager. We found this small book to be a fun and crisp read. In short order, our local group solved our problems and thrived in the face of the competition.<br /><br />In 2007, I was now a corporate director for a fortune 500 company and one of our operations were struggling with continual losses. Part of my corrective action was to dust off my old copy of The One Minute Manager and put it to use. I was somewhat surprised that it was still available through Amazon. I bought multiple copies for the managers and as in the past, they started solving their people issues which in turn solved all the other problems.<br /><br />Needless to say, I highly recommend this 'old' book. Plain and simple, it works.  Michael L. Gooch, SPHR Author of [[ASIN:1897326882 Wingtips with Spurs]]
031606792X|5.0|I just found out about the Twilight series this summer. I saw signs for Breaking Dawn everywhere and I got curious. I am not one that usually reads books about vampires and such but my curiosity got the best of me. I can not express how much I have enjoyed reading this series of books. It is fiction at it's finest. It is a beautiful love story that is only found in fairy tales. Every Bella wants to find her Edward and live happily ever after. I feel Breaking Dawn is the perfect end to this saga. The part that was narrated by Jacob Black was brilliant. I can't imagine the story being told in any other way. Bella was too ill to tell the story and Edward too wrought with grief and sadness. Telling it from Jacob's perspective was the only way it could be done in my opinion. I so hope that Stephanie Meyers graces us with a book that tells the rest of the story about Nessie and Jacob, I'm sure it is another great love story in the making. I just hope we get the honor of reading about this love through the imagination of the author that originally created the idea. I am also very anxious to get Midnight Sun in my hands. I can hardly wait to read the story from Edward's prospective. For those that were disappointed I feel slightly sorry for you, this is fiction after all, a fairy tale were happy endings and the impossible are expected and delivered.
031606792X|5.0|As someone who knows that life rarely if ever gets tide up in a nice little bow I enjoy to read a book that gives me this happily ever after.  I agree with the others who have said that the one star ratings are killing ther Breaking Dawn buzz.
B00023B1LC|5.0|I have not read the book, but reviewing this as a movie on it's own, it's quite good and much better than the usual action fare! Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne like a robotic killing machine. Fast paced, engrossing with an intelligent script, this film leaves you wanting more!......and more ye shall get with installments 2 and 3! The DVD has a great transfer and the extended edition is nothing more than a small scene added to the beginning and end of the film. Fortunately the theatrical release is intact.
B00005JPO1|2.0|To be honest this was one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. It was a true letdown because I've been a fan of Indy since I can remember. Raiders was fantastic, Temple was so-so, and Last Crusade was perfect. But this, this was pretty sucky. One thing I just couldn't get over was the aliens. Aliens shouldn't be in Indiana Jones. I think George Lucas got his franchises mixed up. Second is Indy having a son. Don't get me wrong I thought Shia Lebeouf was great, but his character was unnecessary. Now I did like Indy taking on Commies, that was one of the few good things about it. Harrison Ford really let me down.
0793518326|4.0|This book seems so great. Like the \\"ideal\\" Beatles Chord/Tab book around.<br /><br />That's what I thought at first.<br /><br />Pros: A lot of the songs are in here. That's why it's \\"Complete\\". You can play all the Beatles songs on guitar, piano, drums, if you'd like, and you can get near-as-close to the exact chords, riffs, notes, and rhythms.<br /><br />Cons about this book:<br /><br />The print is way very small. You'd need a magnifying glass or really good eyes for this! (I just look close into it) It's all squished onto thinner than thin paper. Very hard to look up a certain song. There are some errors, as well. Lyric errors, mostly, if you pay attention.<br /><br />It's also very heavy. They should make a new edition with separate books.<br /><br />Overall, if you don't mind small print, tissue-thin paper, heavier than hell, some flaws book, then this is good for you!<br /><br />It's still the best Beatles Scores book around, in my opinion. It's very nearly accurate, as I said. Get it if you want to start playing those Beatles songs!
031606792X|5.0|I have to admit, the night the book came out, I couldn't go to the midnight release because I had work at 9am the next morning for 9 hours and again on Sunday at 9. I knew myself well enough to know if I had bought it i'd never sleep and just stay up the whole time reading and hate myself for it in the morning.(spoilers ahead)    So what did I do instead? Read spoilers online. I needed to atleast know what happened, and when I heard the base story of Bella and Nessie and Jacob imprinting on an infant (yes I still find it slightly disturbing) and I was agreeing with alot of people online about having a book burning... when I'd never actually read the book.    I was a HUGE fan of the first 3 books and had convinced many people to read them as well including my mom who went out and got the 4th book anyway regardless of my warnings and she LIKED IT. I was curious and knew i'd read it anyway so I finally got around to it and I also liked it very much.    I must admit I do wish SOMEONE had to sacrafice SOMETHING. It was all a little too easy for them. No loss of control for Bella and also no losing Charlie or Jacob and her wolf friends. Getting to have a child she never thought she would have etc. No loss for Edward, getting Bella forever and a daughter to love. No loss for Charlie or Rene not having to think   Bella dead. No loss for Jacob finally imprinting on someone. No loss for Rosalie thanks to Nessie. May not have been her child but it was something. I cant think of one character with the exception of Leah and Tanya and Kate that really lost anything. ( and without losing Irina the story would have made little sense)    As for Leah I wish they had ended her story too. If SM wanted a happily ever after she really should have tied up her story as well. I know she's Jacobs Beta but does she ever find someone etc    Now I wouldn't say this is my favorite book of the series (that goes to Eclipse<3) but SM didn't let us down. The book was well written and suspensful andvery good. There is nothing wrong with Happily ever after every once in a while and hey, this is SM's world here that she let us into, she can end it however she wants.
6301971272|5.0|Sergio Leone once said that he knew more about the old west than any American.  I'm not sure he was right, but he might have been right about Hollywood westerns.  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is so good that it's title has become a part of the English language lexicon.  The movie is, in it's own way, a comedy but there are moments of stark realism and pathos.  The movie is not particularly logical or consistent but more than makes up for it with gritty characters and austere symbollism.<br /><br />I hate it when people summarize films and books.  Why should a reviewer want to give the story away to people who haven't seen it?  I will hit some high points, however.  The movie starts with a very dangerous scam.  Eli Wallach--Tuco, The Ugly--is wanted for a long list of crimes.  Eastwood turns him in and collects the reward money.  Tuco is convicted to hang.  Just as the door door is fixing to drop, Eastwood from some distance away, shoots the rope in two. Both Eastwood and Wallach ride off to rip-off another town.<br /><br />The Civil War is raging in New Mexico and Blondy finds a wagon loaded with dead Confederate soldiers and houseflies.  One man, dying, mentions Confederate gold buried...somewhere.  Tuco and Blondy, dressed as Confederate troopers, are captured by Yankees.  When in the prison camp they encounter Lee Van Cleef, the very, very Bad.  While soldiers sing sweetly outside, Van Cleef and his henchmen beat our boys for information about the gold.<br /><br />There is escape and treachery.  Eastwood drags Wallach through the desert heat on the end of a rope.  He releases him and Tuco, in a wonderful scene, barges in to a gun store, looking for the right weapon.  Not satisfied with any, he starts taking them apart and putting parts together again.  Satisfied with his new weapon, he terrorizes the shop keeper and steals the revolver.<br /><br />In another scene Wallach encounters his Catholic Priest brother who curses him for being an outlaw.  Wallach smacks him down and disgustedly tells him that after his brother went to the seminary, the family starved.  Banditry was the way he fed the family.<br /><br />In another scene, the comical Wallach is taking a bath in a Civil War battle under fire from Yankee field guns.  A man who hates Wallach for some previous wrong, sneaks in to shoot him.  Wallach shoots him, instead, because, as it turns out, Wallach always bathes with his revolver on his waist.<br /><br />Another fabulous scene involves a battle.  After the fighting is over and the soldiers have left, Eastwood finds a dying Southern soldier.  Without a word being spoken, they exchange a cigarette back and forth until the soldier dies...one small act of humanity.<br /><br />The last scene is truly amazing...even spectacular.  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly face off in a three way duel in a cemetary.  Nobody knows who to shoot at first.  The camera pans up and you can see that the cemetary is an ampitheatre with the dead as the silent spectators.  Dead people viewing an act of death.  Wow.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexicohim that after his brother went to the seminary, the family starved.

B001DDBCUU|4.0|I really liked this movie.  Of course, I was a big fan of the TV series.  Fashion is the fifth great friend here--and was nothing to sneeze at in the series.  It was terrific to spend time with these women and although it's a fairly long movie, it held my attention.  There were a couple of flaws in it for me.  I just don't think Mr. Big/John would have handled the church wedding like he did. That seemed considerably out of character--way too crass and heavy handed.  The other flaw had to do with Stanford, Carrie's beloved male best friend.  He seemed to serve no other purpose in the movie other than the writer/director letting us know he was still alive--and we could barely tell that.  He deserved a better showing.  Overall though, terrific entertainment.
B000UAFDP2|5.0|Update (2010/10/09) I finally just bought this when it was nice and cheap.  The below error is certainly NOT present in the version I was sent, so this error has apparently been fixed.  Also the picture quality on this blu-ray is fantastic.  Upped to 5 stars!<br /><br />==Original Review==<br /><br />FYI - From Joshua Zyber at High-Def Digest (I have not confirmed this myself.  I'm waiting for word on the resolution of this before buying my copy):<br /><br />\\"A bizarre editing problem has been discovered on the Sony Blu-ray. Thanks to reader Tim for sending in the following description of the issue, which I can verify is also present on my copy:\\"<br /><br />\\"At 1:31.43 - 1:31.49, a bug climbs into the base and gets shot to pieces by the troopers, followed by a shot of Michael Ironside and Jake Busey shooting rounds into some (off-screen) bugs. After that, Casper Van Dien screams to Michael Ironside that help is on the way. Then at 1:32.00 - 1:32.06, exactly the same footage with the bug getting blown to pieces and the shot with Ironside and Busey is repeated! This time Ironside can be heard (not seen) saying, \\"Fall back into the compound. Fall back!\\" Also missing this second time is the sound of the guns tearing up the bug. I remember that on the DVD version, after the shot with Casper Van Dien and Dina Meyer, Michael Ironside says (and was seen on screen too) the \\"Fall back\\" line and then jumps off the barricade. All of this is missing on the Blu-Ray version.\\"<br /><br />\\"Indeed, I checked the Superbit DVD and the UK Blu-ray edition and both are edited differently, with Ironside voicing his line on camera and then jumping off the barricade. The repeated footage on the new disc is a strange anomaly and must be the result of an error in the source materials that Sony used for their transfer. For what it's worth, the problem lasts only six seconds, and the scene is edited so quickly that I didn't even notice until it was specifically pointed out to me.\\"
B0016NF06O|5.0|This cd has been on my regular cd player and car player as well as loaded on my computer and IPod.  Very, very well done by two unique musical giants. Get this cd as these two cannot be cloned.
B0017I1FP8|4.0|I'm a fan of dramatic, serious soundtracks, and this one certainly takes proud place in that category among recent films. The two composers have done a fine job of mingling \\"ordinary\\" musical composition with atmospheric sounds, such as the throaty flapping that literally conjures something between a rippling cape and a bat's wing. The new themes introduced to accompany the new characters are harder to compare even than apples and oranges. The Joker's theme is, quite appropriately, savage and industrial, a bit reminiscent of a badly-maintenanced train growling into a station, but more or less impossible to verbally categorize. Harvey Dent's theme is some of the more happy and triumphant music of the score, though tinged with pathos. The track featuring his theme is probably the most classically influenced part of the soundtrack.<br /><br />I like this music. It's not a symphonically-oriented score like, for instance, that of The Lord of the Rings films or even Zimmer's Gladiator, and listeners seeking a score built on more classical lines may be disappointed. As a musical accompaniment and enhancement to the film, however, this music does wonders to set the proper tone, and is also a pleasure to listen to. Zimmer and Howard can be somewhat fluid with their themes, but in my opinion most of the tracks have more than enough structure to hold it all together.<br /><br />A few caveats: from my listening so far, tracks 5 through 7 seem fairly lackluster compared to most of the other music, but they add up to only five minutes or so out of a 70+ minute CD. I was also somewhat disappointed not to find some of those full-throttle thematic recaps during the end credits in the huge final track. It's not that the final track doesn't have interesting music, but I've left the theater air-conducting to those marvelous Batman themes, and I miss it here--but I have a weakness for that kind of strong, dramatic music, and perhaps the composers wanted to end things on a gentler note.<br /><br />In the first film, Bruce Wayne states his intention to create \\"something elemental, something terrifying,\\" and this, of course, is what ultimately becomes the persona of Batman. Zimmer and Howard took on the task of scoring that idea with a will, and this is a fine continuation of that excellent start. This soundtrack has a unique style, and may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I recommend it.st film, Bruce Wayne states his intention to create \\"something elemental, something terrifying,\\" and this, of course, is what ultimately becomes the persona of Batman.

031606792X|3.0|I have been a long-time fan of the Twilight saga, i.e. Books 1-3, and had highly anticipated Breaking Dawn. After having finished it, I felt like the last book in the series was a lacklustre attempt by an otherwise good writer. Don't get me wrong, I did not hate the book like some other readers, I just didn't feel that the book was up to SM's usual standards of writing.<br /><br />Firstly, Breaking Dawn could have done with much better editing - there are numerous typos in here that really grated on my nerves. Also, the book could have been shorter - Part 2 - told from Jacob's perspective was a plodding read for me. I really struggled to get through the whole of Part Two, and I found the style of writing quite different from Parts One and Three [both from Bella's POV]. The writing seemed almost infantile, it reflected poorly on Jacob's character and made him seem very immature.<br /><br />Secondly, Breaking Dawn does seem to suffer from an over-neat plot - where everything seems to flow easily in Bella Swan nee Cullen's world. I had hoped that Bella's character would be better developed in this book - giving her a sense of maturity lacking in the previous three books. Yes, she becomes a wife and finds herself part of a family, but where is the sense of self-development, of coming into her own? What little there is written about that, it really does not do justice to Bella, and I felt she could have been portrayed much stronger and independent-minded than how she was portrayed in the book.<br /><br />Edward seemed almost an afterthought in this book - yes, he is present throughout, but what purpose does he really serve besides being there for Bella, all the time? There really was not much perspective provided about his thoughts and feelings on the crisis he and Bella go through. Their development as a married couple and the challenges that come with the new dynamics in their relationship is superficial - mostly to do with their strong sexual desire for each other.<br /><br />Jacob - where do I begin? I don't want to give too much away, but his character here seemed a shadow of the strong, passionate Jacob from the earlier books. When you read the book, you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />Other characters - I too would have liked to see more character development in Leah and Seth Clearwater, both interesting characters in their own right.<br /><br />Plot - the narrative seemed weakened by over-descriptions of feelings [worry, passion etc] on the part of Bella and her 'family'/coven. The crisis that they face seemed rushed through in its description, and the resolution seemed very tame in comparison to the other books in the series.<br /><br />Finally [WARNING-SPOILER AHEAD] - Jacob's imprinting - though SM takes the edge off what could only be termed a very creepy pairing by using the notion of accelerated development in Jacob's intended mate - it still is creepy and unpalatable, at least in my opinion.<br /><br />Final verdict - those new to the series should focus on the first three in sequence. The final instalment is a lacklustre attempt with a few highlights. I'm not sorry I read it, but I am disappointed with this last effort and can only think of what might have been. Instead of ending with a bang, BD ends with a whimper.n? I don't want to give too much away, but his character here seemed a shadow of the strong, passionate Jacob from the earlier books.

Finally [WARNING-SPOILER AHEAD] - Jacob's imprinting - though SM takes the edge off what could only be termed a very creepy pairing by using the notion of accelerated development in Jacob's intended mate - it still is creepy and unpalatable, at least in my opinion.    Final verdict - those new to the series should focus on the first three in sequence. The final instalment is a lacklustre attempt with a few highlights. I'm not sorry I read it, but I am disappointed with this last effort and can only think of what might have been. Instead of ending with a bang, BD ends with a whimper.
B0000074FL|5.0|I just watched a documentary on Thin Lizzy. Everyone interviewed panned this album claiming it was one of the worst albums they did. I was so pissed that I felt compelled to come here and do a review. I have listened to this album THOUSANDS of times. Often through headphones. I am a huge Thin Lizzy fan and this is one of the best albums ever made. Don't let anyone tell you different. You NEED this album. Trust me. I have been listening to Thin Lizzy since their first album came out.
B0018M6J90|3.0|Sure, \\"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day\\" is frothy and a bit sappy with the romance, but it's also loads of fun.  Without a doubt, there was no heavy lifting on the parts of the versatile Frances McDormand or Ciaran Hinds though they're as delightful to watch as the younger talents.<br /><br />Miss Guinevere Pettigrew has just lost her job (again!) due to her gruffness.  Called the \\"governess of last resort,\\" her agency refuses to place her in another position and she very shortly finds herself queuing for a meal at a soup kitchen in London.  Through some quick thinking on her part, she lands a job as \\"social secretary\\" to a ditzy starlet, Delysia LaFosse (Amy Adams), and finds herself and her quick wits in great demand in one chaotic and hectic day. Filled with one high society high jinx after another, Miss Pettigrew untangles the lives of those she meets and in the process, finds unexpected happiness for herself!<br /><br />It's an entertaining pre-WWII nostalgic romp done with meticulous attention to the music (swing), settings and costumes.  Nothing here demands anything much from the viewer--it's one of those DVDs you pop in and just let it take you for an enjoyable ride.  It's a gussied up flick much like those of Carole Lombard's 1930s screwball comedies.  Touching at the end and an amusing hour-and-a-half.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|I've been a Priest fan forever, even when Rob spilt, I held out hope that they would continue on and they did after about a 7 year break with Ripper up front.<br /><br />This recent release will be a mixed bag for most Priest fans. The reason I say that is simply because it's not what you would expect to hear from this band. If you're looking for 80's style Priest?, it ain't here! If you're looking for 70's style Priest?, well their are elements of it on here as it does somewhat hearken back to the early stuff from albums like Sad Wings Of Destiny and Sin After Sin etc. One things for sure, It'll surprise you in many ways.<br /><br />To be honest, it took me about 20 listens to really start to appreciate what we have here. I guess it comes down to how you perceived this band to be. If you like the 80's stuff, you more than likely wont get into this. If you liked the really early stuff, you'll love this release.<br /><br />Nostradamus is a masterpiece in my books. It's symphonic, overblown, slow and probably far to long, but man does it kick ass. For those of you who say it's not heavy, either you're simply not giving it a chance for the reasons I've stated above, or you're just not listening!<br /><br />Priest has definitely departed from the signature sound we've become used to over the last two decades or so. This release is a different animal here all together and it's back to the old school Priest. Like the headline states, \\"what's old is new again!\\" Rob Halford's voice will always be powerful, after all, he is the Metal God and you do have to give them props for not resting on their laurels and really branching out with this effort.<br /><br />Hell, you get nearly two hours of music here and it is really one tune in 23 parts which provides you the listener with a very cohesive sounding cd.<br /><br />To rap it up, although manny have flamed them for this cd, I think that it really is their best effort thus far. What, did I say that? Absolutely, to me this is a fantastic release that brings you back to the good ol' days before they kind of became a cookie cutter metal band in the 80's (not that's theirs anything wrong with that!). I absolutely love what they've done here as they have taken this band back to it's roots.<br /><br />If you've liked Priest past and present?, you owe it to yourself to check out this latest release. It's truly something special from a band that is as relevant today as it was some 30 years ago.<br /><br />Well done gentlemen!!ck to the good ol' days before they kind of became a cookie cutter metal band in the 80's (not that's theirs anything wrong with that!).

0307269191|1.0|The publishing world has a (monetary) fondness for pushing non-fiction books by fiction writers on us, hoping to capitalize on the author's readership. Stephen King's lovely tome about writing worked. This, Murakami's book on running, did not. I, too, am a middle-aged long-distance runner but found little insight or comfort of either subject in these pages. If you want to read something of depth about running, life, and aging, buy any one of George Sheehan's books instead.
B001B71NOI|3.0|I've been a fan for a while, and I'll just say it's free.<br />I love 1,000,000, it just made me feel juvenile again. But the rest of the album is great just for the whole B-side feel of it. But it doesn't get that heavy of a rotation on my Ipod.<br /><br />After taking his other work so seriously it's nice to have somthing to not take so seriously.
B000002H33|3.0|Battery, the title song, and Orion are almost the only reason to own this album. The rest of the music on here is heavy and dark, but it just shuffles onward like the soldiers depicted in Disposable Heroes, until eventually the album dies with Damage, Inc.    And this is Metallica's most popular thrash album. They reached their peak on Ride the Lightning, with a little boost for this album's follow-up, but here they fell well short of writing engaging music. Most of this fails to thrash like RTL did, and only comes close to matching the darkness and gloom of ...And Justice for All. I suppose one thing this album has going for it is the bass. But that's not enough.    Battery starts out the album good, giving the listener high expectations for what's to come. Master of Puppets takes you even higher, being a much better song. Orion is their best instrumental, and probably Metallica's most melodic song. The solos and riffs in this one beat anything else this album has to offer. Sure Disposable Heroes is fast and thrashy but it has too few ideas for too long a length. I wasn't interested in it for eight full minutes. The rest is rather boring.    This is good for three stellar songs, but if you're looking for speed stick to RTL, and if you're looking for gloominess, take the follow-up. If you want some heavy background music that functions well as white noise, pick this up. The only reason this gets three stars is because it still slays everything they've done since 1990.
B00004WG2F|5.0|Excellent movie. Great story line and the casting was superb. A lot of action and a real love story. Really enjoyed.
B000M3452Y|5.0|I was skeptical of this band a while now, being weary of all things hipster and hyped. I love good electronic music though, be it ambient, idm, 80's style dance. As with many trends, I jump on the bandwagon a bit late, but I'm so glad I didn't miss this one. Luckily my local library had this and I took it out and gave it a few listens and was immediately engaged. Every so often a release drops and makes your ears perk. This is definitely one of 'em. From start to finish it's a gem. Growing up in the 80's, being big into New Order, Human League and the underground dance music of the time, this disc gave me chills, it was so dead on as far as getting that special sound that so many imitate but fail at. this is a band who KNOWS. At the same time, this is a very current release, and in my opinion, will be a classic from this decade. It's tough to pick favorites--the music and lyrics are all very good. \\"Someone Great\\" is beautiful and reflective, in the best way, and \\"Get Innocuous\\" is a storming, strobe and smoke opener with Enoesque vocals. \\"Time To Get Away\\" is an extremely catchy, dance-funk number reminding me of Gang Of Four, as well as some other releases from back in the day. \\"North American Scum\\" has some of the freshest lyrics I've heard from anyone in a while and is another that will have you dancing, if you know what's good for you.    I don't want to label this band as a \\"retro\\" outfit. I see them more as a group who loves and knows a particular era (or several for that matter) and assimilate that love and knowledge into the now. I plan on picking up all their stuff (just heard \\"45:33\\" and thoroughly enjoyed it). I just hope they keep dropping more good stuff like this (and maybe tour again for those who were late to the table).
0823023494|5.0|I've read several how to draw books. So far the the most instruction I've ever gotten was \\"do this, then do that.\\" The books never explained why. This book explains why. The reason why you start out with simple shapes was probably the biggest \\"Oh yeah! OK!\\" moment for me and there were several other momnets.<br /><br />The book is very well narrated. I actually read through this like a story book, the first time. It is easy to follow and at the end of each chapter there are homework assignments to help you get going. The assignments are a little tough, so you are expected to know how to do a few things, but I haven't met a how to draw book that started with \\"This is how you draw a line.\\"<br /><br />I personally love Anime and Manga and that is the style of art I try to emulate. With this book it doesn't matter what style of art you are trying to master, you will get help from this book.
031606792X|1.0|My wife pre-ordered this book (which she found delightful), but we returned it because it was sent via USPS and didn't arrive til a week after its release. She bought it at a big box store the day after it release. When we  pre-ordered the Harry Potter books they arrived the day of their release via UPS. Amazon has dropped the ball by switching to Post Office standard delivery. Why bother with an Amazon pre-order?
B00110K62U|5.0|This is the definitive version of the incredible stage production of Les Miserables. With all those amazing voices, particularly Michael Ball, it's a must-have for any fan of this show. The ending, with the many Jean Valjeans from around the world singing in their own tongue, is truly spectacular.
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning starts out slow, throwing the listener off at first, but comes in pounding with power after a few moments. Fight Fire with Fire is their best opener and one of their most intense thrashy songs. Then comes the title song, the best one on the album, loaded with solos and harmonies that sound like the epitome of electric guitar music. That cover art takes on real meaning while listening to this song, the lightning scorching the chair coming to life as you hear those harmonies. You can easily imagine the jolts ripping through you if you were sitting there. As a fan of metal you'd probably have that song stuck in your head as you roast for your crimes.    The music doesn't let up there as we have two slower songs that are still chock full of intensity and meaning. Unlike the slower cuts on Master of Puppets, these actually go somewhere and keep you interested for the duration. Then the album hits you with its thrashiest moment in Trapped Under Ice. Even Fight Fire with Fire can't match this for speed and impact. Right out the gate this song bangs your head. There is a quieter moment that was atypical for Metallica with the song Escape, but even this works better than the slow stuff on MoP. It's basically a rock song played by a metal band, something they would become notorious for later on, but here it works well as a breather before the grand finale. Creeping Death is one of Metallica's signature songs, and probably their darkest. Justice's songs were pretty dark, but this beats that entire album for all-out midnight-hour gloom. To close, they have the monster instrumental Call of Ktulu. It's great to hear, but Orion was more melodic, and Megadeth did this particular song better with Hangar 18 later on. Still--what a way to end an album! And what an album!    Metallica reached their absolute peak here, with great production and some commercial value without sacrificing their ability to create great music with integrity and intensity.
031606792X|3.0|I have been a fan of this series since I read the first book after hearing about it over and over again  Being a fan of Vamp romances - especially young adult ones (my nearly 30 year old self has yet to let go of a love of YA novels!) - I decided to give this series a whirl.<br /><br />While I still believe that the first novel is the best by far, this one didn't dissapoint me nearly like I was expecting it to after reading all of these reviews.<br /><br />**spoilers**<br /><br />The novel picks up pretty much where the last one left off and Bella is a few weeks away from her wedding.  She is still on the fence though about becoming a vampire immediately after the wedding or waiting a bit.  She eventually convinces Edward to make love to her and with that joining they create a baby.  Thus enters the drama and what is upsetting everyone.<br /><br />Bella does in the end get her fairy tale ending - but why shouldn't she?  I don't think this novel is supposed to be Emily Post's guide to how to be a teenager.  It's supposed to be the story of an unbreakable romantic bond between a mere mortal and a vampire.  The conclusion of that story is that they get to live happily ever after - after going into the depths of hell to get there.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved this series sci fi and western mixed together get stories and character interaction.
031606792X|4.0|Highly recommended!  I bought this for my wife and she finished it in two days.  She really enjoys this series and can't wait for the movie to come out.  This book is the biggest book of all the series and I guess my wife has already read it twice.  This book is so dang cheap as well for being a hardback copy.  You won't go wrong with this purchase!

1595141715|1.0|i was very disappointed reading this book. i read all the other reviews and i had very high expectations. this book sounded very promising and had a great story behind it, but the actual story was terrible.     the story is about a girl who sends 13 tapes to 13 people who caused her to commit suicide.     i thought the idea was great, but when i read why she commited suicide i was very disappointed. i kept thinking something terrible was about to happen but nothing ever bad did happen, that would cause a person to commit suicide. yes, everyone has tough times but her problems werent so bad that i would agree with her commiting suicide. i felt that she kept finding reasons to kill herself instead of trying to find friends and looking for help. even when she did try to find help, she gave up right away and blamed everyone around her for not \\"helping her\\".    i would not recommend this book to anyone. i read a lot of good books and this is NOT one of them.
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book, but what else do you expect from Stephenie Meyer?!  Thanks!
B000Z8GZYW|1.0|I've heard so many people say this movie is great over the years that I actually almost started to believe it.  But this film is like Starship Troopers: you can succeed in telling yourself that it was good up until the point where you actually have to watch it again.  I suppose it may have been the intention of the writers for the audience to experience Bill Murray's agony, but not quite to this degree.<br /><br />  I like Bill Murray, the problem in this film is everyone else.  They're two-dimensional morons, cardboard cutouts that float around delivering scripted lines to advance the increasingly rickety plotline.  There's not a single believable character in this film.  A small problem for a romantic comedy, considering it's not actually funny.
031606792X|5.0|this book is amazing! its  a long read because of all the loose ends it has to tie. lots of twists and turns. not what i expected at all to happen. but turned out to be a great book!
031606792X|4.0|A few chapters into the book I suspected there would be many people who hated this book. Upon finishing, I looked online and my suspicion proved to be true. I don't really understand why people hate it so much. Because it isn't what they expected/wanted? Hello it is a book, as in fantasy, as in not real life. So approach this book with an open mind and no expectations, enjoy it for what it is and move on.
0743290119|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this book. I didn't enjoy the author's second book at all, which I thought was just a clone of her first novel, the famous \\"Devil Wears Prada.\\" I'm happy to report that Ms. Weisberger really branches out with her latest book, \\"Chasing Harry Winston.\\" This book is nothing like her first two. It's a little slow in the beginning--I had some trouble getting into it. But about a quarter of the way through, the plot picked up, and I finished the book in two days. Yes, the ending is formulaic--but what else did anyone expect?? Also, I didn't really relate to any of the three female characters. But that didn't stop me from turning the pages and wondering what would happen next. Plus, I absolutely loved the story of Otis--what an adorable subplot!! Ms. Weisberger is a very talented writer--she certainly knows how to turn a phrase. I think some of the reviews here are unfair and harsh. This is a great summer read. I would call \\"Chasing Harry Winston\\" chick lit for intellectuals.

0670867950|5.0|TREASURE ISLAND is quite simply *the* classic pirate story.  It is a supremely enjoyable read, an adventure tale with danger, mystery, suspense, and travel to exotic places--not to mention pirates!<br /><br />Robert Louis Stevenson's TREASURE ISLAND tells of the coming of age of the boy Jim Hawkins, the son of innkeepers.  One day, Jim's parents take on a strange boarder, the \\"captain,\\" later revealed to be a pirate mate, Billy Bones.  The \\"captain\\" kept in his room a chest within which, it is revealed after his death, there is a treasure map indicating gold and silver buried on a deserted island.  Jim takes the map to the local physician, Doctor Livesey, and the squire John Trelawney.  Spurred to action, Trelawney secures a ship, the Hispaniola, which is captained by Alexander Smolletts.  He invites Livesey to serve as ship's surgeon and Jim as cabin boy.  Trelawney also hires the crew--most of whom turn out to be pirates associated with the treasure map's original owner, Captain Flint.  The pirates are led by the ship's cook, Long John Silver, a wily, one-legged, parrot-bedecked, opportunistic pirate chief.  (Stevenson's Long John Silver profoundly shaped later popular pirate lore.)  The pirates intend to kill the captain, squire, doctor, and Jim on the return voyage after having found the buried treasure.  What follows is Jim's adventure of a lifetime.<br /><br />Though intended to be a story for youth, TREASURE ISLAND's nineteenth-century language, particularly the patois of the sea dogs, will challenge readers under ten.  Amusingly, it sometimes also challenges Jim Hawkins, who can't always follow what the pirates are saying.  Though the language at times may be difficult, the suspense of the tale will keep propelling readers forward to its exciting and satisfying end.<br /><br />This \\"Whole Story\\" edition is lavishly illustrated with color drawings based on the story.  There are also pages devoted to types of sailing vessels, sails, knots, compasses and other nautical stuff.  The book also includes a number of sidebar-like illustrated fun facts about pirates and other things only tangentially related to the story.  In fact, I often found the additional material not terribly germane and sometimes intrusive and distracting.  Still, it makes for a handsome gift book.  One simply interested in reading this ripping yarn might choose an edition with simple illustrations or no illustrations at all, save for Stevenson's treasure map.ook also includes a number of sidebar-like illustrated fun facts about pirates and other things only tangentially related to the story.

B000F5GNX8|2.0|I love both Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer but I don't have a lot of positive things to say about this movie. I found it too talky and its plot was not believable. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief while watching it. None of the characters were endearing and it was a challenge to care about what happened to them. Also, in real life, there would be no chemistry between Downey's character and the female lead, Ms. Monaghan. Her history and the reprehensible manner in which she treats him would preclude his devotion (unless he was a complete masochist). Further, and to my disappointment as I'm an extremely politically incorrect person, I found all the gay jokes about Kilmer's Perry obtuse. I really don't think anyone cares about that stuff much in this day and age. Overall, the interactions are too clever by half, and Downey's narration is a bore. Most of what's supposed to be funny...is not--a waste of time in my view.
0765348276|5.0|How often do you come across a book that you simply cannot put down? Well, you've found one with John Scalzi's book Old Man's War. And don't think this is only for sci-fi fans, 'cause it's not!! This book is one battle after another told from the soldier's point-of-view. I think you knew that by the title, but what you may not have known is that the elderly are recruited to solve the problems posed to humanity. But this being the protaganists second chance at life, he is forced to make the most of it. The writing is top-notched, the characters, well-developed, and the plot, enthralling.<br /><br />You might also like: [[ASIN:0441783589 Starship Troopers]]
0743496736|5.0|This is a story about cruelty and evil. Since it's about a school shooting, you'd assume the bad guy is the one with the guns. Think again.<br /><br />What the shooter does is unforgivable, killing 10 kids and hurting many more. But he acts more as a reaction to cruelty and evil than because he is naturally that way himself.<br /><br />Everyone has, at one time or another, felt like an outsider, like they don't belong. Peter Houghton is an oddball from the beginning, and school is a place where such kids are often tormented. In a series of searing vignettes, Peter is essentially tortured by other students. It reminded me of baby birds in the wild, who will sometimes peck weaker siblings to death.<br /><br />The final pages have the requisite Jodi Picoult surprise ending, which left me wanting to read high-schooler Josie's narrative. It's not there, so the reader is left to wonder what she is thinking.<br /><br />At first I was hesitant to read this book, because of the grim subject matter. Once I started, it was hard to put down. I wish the author had written more about the high school kids and less about the adults, but it's still a compelling read. I won't let my 9th-grader read it, because it has sex scenes way too raw, but it would be good for 12th-graders and older.

031606792X|5.0|In the beginning, I found Bella's personality to be grating and frustrating.  It seemed as if once she found herself surrounded by men who loved her (and that she could wishy wash in between), that she lost a spine or brain!  HOWEVER, once I kept reading, and got past a good 200 - 250 pages, I finally was able to see that Meyer had to set up a story with a full, rounded plotline.  In the end, I was really captivated by the fourth book in this unusually engaging series.  In fact, while I should have been working and doing any number of other things, I had my nose in a book!  What a great way to spend a couple of days!<br /><br />My recommendation...read on.  If you care about Bella, Edward, or even Jacob, then hang in there, and all will feel resolved.
B0017VG69U|3.0|[[ASIN:B0017VG69U Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete Second Season (Remastered)]]    The shows are great, but don't expect a collector-quality product in the mail. Amazon fails to pack it properly and the plastic case is easily shattered where the two halves come together. That's not a big deal if you're just looking for the DVDs to watch, but if you wanted a collector's item that could increase in value over the years, this is not the way to go.
B000A6T1KE|4.0|First, let me state I dislike about two thirds of the classic, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise content out there.  Still, I'll watch them, because scene to scene they have their moments and there are some very stellar (no pun intended) episodes scattered throughout.<br /><br />Next, I want to dis this film for some legitimate reasons.  To have Wil Weaton in the reception scene sitting next to his mom and then not use him in any other part of the film was ridiculous.<br /><br />I'm geeking out here, but considering Tasha Yar's daughter is Romulan, you'd think we'd encounter her as one of the Romulan commanders later in the film.  Since this is the final \\"future\\" Trek film, that would have been fitting to get all the cast members in.  How did they miss that one?<br /><br />The scene with Data and Picard in his Ready Room drinking wine and speaking of human ritual & bonds (I think that's what it was, it's been a while) should not have been cut. It's essential for both showing the audience more of the friendship between those two, the significant of the Chateau Picard wine toasted later in the film, and the poignancy of Data's sacrifice.  That cut was not only unnecessary, but detrimental to the film's arc.  Forget the \\"tempo\\", \\"momentum\\", or \\"rhythm\\" of the film.  We're not talking action scenes, here.<br /><br />The bat imagery and inspiration was a bit, how do I put this mildly, overt.  No, that's too kind.  It was beating me over the head with a big, dead, stinky bat, like some junior high student short story's grand creative stroke.  Less is more, folks.<br /><br />Finally, my biggest issue in the film, and one I probably let get in the way of my enjoyment of it, was the whole WMD, terrorism, and pro-Iraq invasion slant I perceived.  Now, the virgin terrorist bent on world domination with an awful WMD is something clearly Spiner and friends intended in the script.  The Iraq part was probably just my distaste with what was happening in the media at the time being unjustifiably channeled into the viewing.  I can't be sure, but I suspect that was unintentional and was just some bad luck in the timing of the film's release.  But, hey, maybe my first instincts were right.<br /><br />Nonetheless, like I said, I was too harsh on the film in the theater.  I was fuming, pissed even.  For the seeming Iraq slant, for Data's sudden death without the proper preparation and arc, for the soft, overly-groomed (common recent Trek problem), cheesy-looking Romulan Senate cgi scenes.  However, in retrospect, and especially considering that one scene I mentioned previously that should not have been cut, I think the film is mostly in the right place.  The ship to ship battle sequence at the end is masterful, combining all the techniques originated in the earliest TNG video games and novels, giving realistic division-of-tasks on the bridge, and presenting the events with a \\"truthiness\\" (finally, a use for that word!).  They were 3D, dynamic, nuanced, and believable within the established rules and technologies of this franchise.<br /><br />The short-hand and camaraderie between this troop of actors is here in full force.  I think they're right up there with the cast of MASH, quite frankly, and I'd put these actors in an echelon above that due to the serious and challenging subject matter they've dealt with over the years, not to mention the films. I really can't think of any other ensemble that's of this caliber, each and every one of them.  I'm still not certain the best aura of the series was ever captured in any of the films, but in this one I almost felt they arrived at something more.  Some of the kidding was put aside.  Not all, but more than most of the episodes and films.  There was a mature professionalism exuded by the characters.  Individuals well into the prime of their professional and personal lives, dealing with the threats, changes, growth, and loses life entails.<br /><br />The film's look, I have to point out before wrapping this up, is gorgeous.  The Romulan senate has that awful overly-groomed thing going on, like I said.  In the rest of the film, however, the textures, lighting, pure white lights to subtle colors, those lens flares, the fascinating hue of Data's skin and eyes...often all of this happening at the same time!  A feast for the peepers.  This is without a doubt not only the finest-looking Star Trek outing, but a striking visual achievement, by any standard.  It is not a five star film in my book, but in my opinion it was worth another look.  I know I'll be returning to it some more.  With reservations, but worthy nonetheless.verly-groomed thing going on, like I said.

0060528737|5.0|Like the first 2 books in the Abhorsen trilogy this book was excellent.  It starts off a bit tragic.  However, this is just the beginning of the adventure.  In this book you will see Lirael become a mighty Abhorsen.  She is a very powerful main character and very likeable.  Sameth comes into his own, even his annoying sister is likeable.  The Disreputable Dog is her usual mysterious and loveable self.  This book is a page turner and the need to get to the end is immense.  Mogget will suprise you towards the end.  Without revealing the ending, this book has a happy ending but also a very sad ending.  This is a must read and defiantly a keeper.
0316143472|5.0|This book was so enjoyable! Reading it was like receiving a letter from a friend. The style is so laid back and \\"everyday\\" that you really feel like you're in a conversation with Sedaris and I actually felt disappointed when it was over. The book is also one of those rare items that you can pick up, read any chapter, and thoroughly connect with the content. You might even find yourself running into another room to read passages to your family! :)
B0017MO10U|2.0|I am a die hard stargate fan...this movie was really bad....wish that stargate would stop taking advantage of its loyal fan base by making this straight to DVD movies....end the series or put in back on the air...(i would have much prefered to pay $10 to go see on big screen vs buying the expensive dvd.)
0930289234|5.0|I have never been a reader of comics, and this is only the second graphic novel I've tried. I have to say, I am so glad I did! I still have 3 chapters left, but every panel of Watchmen is beautifully crafted, both in the story and the illustration. I will admit that I bought this so I will have some idea what the upcoming movie is about, and now that I have read the novel, I really hope Hollywood has done it justice!
B000OY8NII|4.0|I had never seen the actual show, just snippets of advertising.  It sounded like fun and boy is it entertaining.
B0000457HB|5.0|I recently purchased this Barry White cd, and it is fabulous. His music is so romantic and heartfelt. I can think of none other I would rather listen to on a quiet evening spent at home with the one I love. I would highly recommend Barry White's music for anyone who considers themselves to be \\"hopelessly\\" romantic. I have gotten much enjoyment from Barry White's music, and hope to enjoy it for many years to come.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|[[ASIN:B000BTC5LW Pink Floyd - Pulse]]<br /><br />Probably the most complete Pink Floyd DVD I have ever viewed! Sound quality and video presentation was great.<br /><br />I had the VHS version of this presentation and this new DVD mix was far superior.<br /><br />If you are a die hard 'Floyd' fan, this is a DVD for you!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I played it before and finally decided to purchase it. The only problem is that I forgot it requires a minimum of 3 players. I played with my husband and it was fine, not as challenging though. I would recommend this game to anybody who enjoys playing strategy games. This game is great for those family evenings together or just groups of friends. Summary: fun, challenging, fast, easy to learn, enjoyed over a wide age range.
B0013D8LCW|1.0|A movie to watch on a boring Sunday afternoon and only if you have absolutely nothing else to do. Fortunately it is not very long, quite predictable and also easy to forget. If you'r busy, movie lover or a thinker in anyway, just stay away.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Great movie, great cast,wonderful music that keeps the joy of the movie alive day after day!
0671646788|5.0|I listened to this on unabridged audio, and I loved it! The narrator's voice is charged up with enthusiasm and is very engaging, and the tips and tricks are basic but very powerful. If you are just beginning a new venture and suspect that your mind may not be in the right place - read this book.<br /><br />I loved the simple exercises and tricks for engaging your passion and excitement about what you do. One trick I tried that I really liked was that I defined what service I was really providing to people. I am a landscaper, so instead of saying \\"I trim people's gardens and keep them neat\\", I said \\"I help people take joy and pleasure in their home and outdoor spaces, and make it easy for them to connect with nature and our awesome outdoor world. I also help them achieve all that they can in their own lives by providing a relaxing and beautiful space for them to unwind and think clearly in.\\"<br /><br />Do you see how the second one makes me feel charged up every day to go to work? And what an impact that has on my employees, to know that they are in the business of helping people connect with the environment and achieve all they can in their lives, through the enjoyment of their outdoor spaces?<br /><br />These kinds of small tips help you wrap your mind around making your job your life's work, and help you take things to the next level. I think people hire me over my competitors because I love what I do and it shows in my voice and actions, and this book really helps me keep that passion alive even on the rainy days or when I get bit by wasps.<br /><br />There were a lot of great small tips like that about how to have the right attitude to enable success. I'd really recommend it to anyone stuck in the doldrums of their work or just beginning a new venture.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|When I first heard about Generation Kill, I expected it to simply be a glamorised version of the Iraq War where it shows everything working smoothly. What I didn't expect was a gritty and true story of the 1st Recon Marines during the first wave of the American invasion of Iraq. It didn't hold back, and honestly I would have hated it if they did. I later found out that this was based on the book written by journalist Evan Wright who followed this company during the initial invasion. I haven't read the book, but from the other stuff I've read I'm lead to believe it keeps true to the novel.<br /><br />The show focuses around the 1st Recon Marines company as a part of the initial invasion of Iraq that eventually overthrew Sadaam Hussein. It shows the true struggles that the marines went through during this invasion as they struggled with supply shortages and conditions. They are joined by Rolling Stones reporter Evan Wright (Book Author) who's there to see what really goes on in the Marine Corps. It's not about Wright or is it even about one particular Marine, it's rather a show about the entire company and their particular personalities.<br /><br />This is the more interesting and disturbing nature of the show. A lot of the soldiers displayed appear to have some real mental problems when it comes to their enthusiasm to kill anything in sight, or just their general views of the Iraqi people. It touches upon the civilian killings and how some order were actually made by the higher ups to kill any Iraqi whether they had weapons displayed or not. On one hand I would say it's wrong to have people with such mental problems i.e. a bit too enthusiastic to kill. On the other hand, if you didn't have these particular individuals then would we even have an army capable enough to fight such a war.<br /><br />Another aspect of the show, aside from the disturbing images or the general crudeness of it all is the irreverent humour displayed. It's not intentional and certainly isn't set up to be hysterical, it simply comes across as that as within the conversations of some of these men, like any chat with friends etc. you always get the odd unintentional classic line. This gives the entire show a well rounded feel and is something to be experienced by everyone. I applaud those who are over in Iraq and Afghanistan as, unfortunately due to my ignorance before this show I didn't know things were so tough.<br /><br />It's an overall great show and another classic creation by HBO. Be warned, however, as it is very graphic in relation to violence and if you're easily offended by strong or racist language then I would advise you stay away.it simply comes across as that as within the conversations of some of these men, like any chat with friends etc. you always get the odd unintentional classic line.

1400063515|4.0|This is the book that I've personally recommended to more people than any other.<br /><br />Taleb's main point--that the world is far more random and unpredictable than almost anyone grasps--is well worth making. This, as he shows, is especially clear and crucial in human-dominated activities such as economics, politics and the social sciences.<br /><br />I was particularly struck by a graph that appears three-quarters of the way through the book that shows that the ten largest one-day changes in the U.S. stock market account for half of the returns. This is a mind-blowing demonstration that anyone, including the Nobel-prize-winning economists Taleb reviles--who estimates risk under the assumption that the stock market follows the Gaussian bell-shaped curve is on extremely shaky ground.<br /><br />Taleb's more general position, that in most human activities, \\"black swans\\"--events like 9/11 that are intrinsically unpredictable--make the most difference, is also an invaluable eye-opener.<br /><br />After many pages of argument, I'm even willing to agree that whether we like it or not, we do live in chaotic, risky and unpredictable \\"Extemistan\\" rather than relatively tranquil \\"Mediocristan.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, the more I came to appreciate what Taleb has to say, the less I liked how he says it. He comes across as an angry, aggressive, in-your-face intellectual snob. I was tired of his tirades and gratuitous insults by page 7. They continue through to the last line of the book, where he, a \\"person of commerce\\" takes a last swipe at other persons of commerce.<br /><br />Still, if you can get past his abrasive style, you can benefit, and maybe even profit from his frequently brilliant insights.
031606792X|2.0|This is your SPOILER alert.  Read at your own peril!  Don't complain later!<br /><br />I was Disappointed, with a capital D.  I wanted so badly for this book to be great.  I did read some of the spoilers before the book so I knew what to expect and will admit it wasn't as bad to me as some reviewers have said, but that is their opinion and this is mine.  I really loved Twilight, wanted to Slap Bella in New Moon, and couldn't stand Edward in Eclipse.  However these didn't feel like the same characters to me in this book.  Bella changed so dramatically after becoming a vampire that she was no longer Bella.  Edward was just weird and don't get me started on nicknaming the scary scary Jasper, Jazz.  All I could think was \\"Jazz hands!!!\\"  The names Renesmee and Jazz took me out of the story every single time they appeared on the page.  Even Nessie wasn't as bad.  I thought the writing was still fluid and Bella did retain her humorous angle on many things, but it definitely seemed like Meyers wanted everyone to have a happy ending whether it made sense or not.  The only message I got from this book was that everyone of your desires, even the ones you didn't know you had, will be granted if you want it enough, no sacrifice needed, even if your desires conflict.  Your werewolf best friend is in love with you even though you love someone else, no problem!  He will just imprint on the baby girl you die giving birth to!  Hey, you don't want to die giving birth, don't worry!  Your vampire husband will save you with venom and CPR!  You worry about hurting your loved one and innocents while being a newborn vamp?  No problem!  We'll just give you supernatural control and a \\"love shield\\" to boot!  I am glad that Meyers loves her characters enough to want them to live H.E.A., but sad that she doesn't love her readers enough to write something intelligent and meaningful for them.  Thankfully I am past the stage in life where having a teen-aged mother role model in a book will make a difference, but still I was expecting a touch more substance in the plot.  Most of the motivations seem contrived, and the dialogue a little flat.  Nice try but not remotely believable even within the world Meyers created.  Please explain how a male vamp can produce semen but not tears.  Wait, scratch that, I don't want to know!  I just don't care.ce, but still I was expecting a touch more substance in the plot.

031606792X|4.0|I liked this book well enough, but it's not the best in the series that's for sure.
B000IOM0X8|4.0|Its a action film, fun and a good escape, predictable but I wasn't expecting a majestic plot or amazing twists. Worth buying and worth watching a few times.
B001BMKOZW|1.0|I gave this one star because the system would not let me leave them blank.  Let me premise this review by saying I used to be a huge fan of SOAD.  I have grown to not be such a fan these days.  I purchased this CD because I heard, \\"They Say\\", playing on the tv's at Target.  I liked what I heard so I bought the CD not knowing who the people in the band were.  It is a big disappointment because I like Daron Malakian's style of playing and singing, but the lyrics are so nonsensical and vulgar I just can't get past them.  Not to mention the Jesus bashing, and drug references in the majority of the songs.  If there is a large group of people that think these lyrics are ok, we as a country are in big trouble.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|For all the flaws that the Prequels may have, they're still highly enjoyable films, with just as many memorable scenes and quotes as the Original Trilogy.  I think it's great that they're keeping the movies out there for any new generation to purchase (not that DVDs are that hard to come by of course), and really it's nice to have a convenient box set.  So it's a good deal, if, you don't have the movies already.  Otherwise, it's just another stepping stone in the journey towards the much wanted \\"Ultimate\\" box set with all six films.  We can only hope!
031606792X|5.0|I thought it was great and I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews.  I loved that there was a happy ending and the only problem that I had with it is that I finished it too quickly!
B00005K3OT|5.0|I love this film. Juliette Binoche is a joy as the town's newest resident, and her open ways are very foreign to some of her neighbors. Judi Dench is, as always, terrific. From a very personal perpective, Johnny Depp shows up too late in the film, but, as always, lives his role. This may not be a great film and some may feel it is hitting them too hard pointing out people's prejudices. But people do have them and it never hursts to remind us to look beyond the surface. Tjhe film does not treat dogmatic religion too kindly--but I don't have a problem with that.
031606792X|5.0|I've always read the Twilight saga purely for entertainment, which is exactly what Stephenie Meyer wrote the story for, ENTERTAINMENT.  There was no message, no moral.  She didn't disappoint on the final installment.  Loved it, and like all her others, could not put it down.  My only regret was that it had to end!
031606792X|5.0|I enjoyed this fast paced, thoroughly descriptive finale to the Twilight series.  Good closure with a couple of loopholes for a sequel (if she so chooses) in the future.  I have seen this book being read on a plane (three girls) and in the airport waiting for luggage to arrive.  One of the best fictional reads I've had in years.  Super!!!
B000JK8OYU|1.0|When I bought this cd (from Barnes and Noble) i thought to myself this is going to be great listenting.  What is it? songs sung by the beatles that sound like they're high or stoned or whatever. Most of the songs are awful there are only two I liked. Please don't waste your money.
031606792X|5.0|My daughter as well as all the girls in her 4H club have been waiting patiently for the book and read through it while at the county fair they all loved it
B0000549B0|4.0|It's really nice, upon occasion, to watch a movie that's nice and heartwarming without being sentimental and kitsch.  The word used most often in \\"Harvey\\" is \\"pleasant.\\"  Pleasant works.  And, like most of the characters decide, sometimes choosing to be pleasant is better than choosing to be regular, or choosing to be smart.  Lucky for this movie, it's both pleasant and smart.<br /><br />Now, if you haven't seen this movie yourself, you've probably seen clips of it on other movies, such as \\"Field of Dreams.\\"  But really, seeing this movie would be something you should get around to doing.  James Stewart plays the warm small-town friendly neighbor with aplomb, even when in socially awkward situations involving disbelief of his pooka.  Everyone else plays the anxious ones... people running around getting into fits because of things they only half understand.  But as the story goes on, Stewart's Elwood P. Dowd becomes the calm center of gravity that everyone eventually leans on to take a breath of air and let their imagination go.<br /><br />What we get is a re-affirmation of imagination and faith, much like the feeling to be gotten from \\"Miracle on 34th Street.\\"  However, \\"Harvey\\" can be watched year round!  And best of all, it shows how to be a good person beyond simply catering to beliefs, but truly following a smile and an ear for listening.  \\"Seems like it'd be a little dull, you should let her do the talking\\", Dowd tells the psychologist (!) who confesses his escapist dream to sit under a tree, drink beer, and talk to a woman for two weeks.  Dowd is both wise and happy, and the movie makes no point of trying to give him difficulties... it's everyone else's problem if they don't want to believe in 6'3 1/2\\" rabbits...<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
B00000272N|5.0|Alice's first album was an all out onslaught. They really did go all out on their first record. With a little bit of flavor from every song. You get the heavy, you get the punk and even a little funk. Like tracks \\"I Know Somethin (bout you)\\" you get the essence of a ZZ Top flavor blended in ........
B000LRY9PY|5.0|Corinne, has a sound that is smooth and caressing and makes you want to be in love, if you are not.  She gives you that warm feeling all over and you find yourself having that far off thought (daydreaming) that makes you sigh with contentment.  Many, of course were introduced to her with \\"Like a Star\\", and \\"Put your records on\\", but \\"til it happens to you\\"  and \\"trouble sleeping\\" honestly give them a run for their money.  If you like laid back styles then here she is.
B0000028M7|5.0|One of The Greatest from the early 90's grunge my personal fav. 1992's DIRT !!!!!!! Where just about all of the subject matter is about heroin...... Touching base with Lonleyness, Istolation, Hoplessness, Massive Anger, Addiction, Emptiness, and Massive Depression ;-x  One of the most darkest and depressing albums ever recorded.......
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|I like that The Temple of Doom is dark, gloomy, depressing, and etc. Somehow, this takes place before the original. Indy, Willie, and Short Round must retrieve a sacred stone that's been stolen from a village, and must save the children that have been stolen. They deal with an evil cult and sacrifices people and make people drink black blood to become on of them! I also love the scene at Pankot Palace when everyone is eating Snake Surprise, Beetles, Eyeball Soup, and Chilled Monkey Brains! If you love Indy and dark plots, you'll love INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM!!!
B000002GJH|5.0|Well this cd is like an old peice of cheese it just gets better as time goes on. Or something like that Lemmy Kilmister once said...... But any way who can forget Chris Cornell and Eddy Vedder sort of Soundgarden meets Pearl Jam experience!!!!!!! Well It just basically is Pearl Jam with Chris Cornell lead vocals.... And who could possibly hate that???????? Inspired by the death of his Roomate Andy Wood , Cornell delivers with a masterpiece \\"Say Hello To Heaven\\"
B00005LK94|5.0|Not only \\"Family Friendly\\" but a great classic to have in your collection.<br />Adults and children can enjoy this movie!  A full five stars, indeed.<br /><br />ASIN:B00005LK94 Fly Away Home (Special Edition)]]
031606792X|4.0|The ending is very anti-climactic.  The audience is already trying to bend reality in order to accept vampires, werewolves (shape shifters), etc. and this book goes even beyond that reality in order to pull everything together.  The daughter's name is hideous.  The main characters barely exist anymore.
0307455378|2.0|[[ASIN:0307455378 El Juego del Ángel (Vintage Espanol)]]  Que lastima que tan buena escritura se pierda en un tema tan absurdo y engannoso.

Mi amigo Ruiz Zafon: o pensamos mejor las historias antes de publicarlas o terminan sus libros en el Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados.
B000IHYY52|5.0|This is a must to have for your Jazz collection. Selection of performers, sound and video quality is GREAT. Highly recommend this concert. If you like jazz you can not go wrong with this disk.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie is a must see for people who believe in serendipity. The combination of circumstances is truly extraordinary and stresses your ability to believe them. But in the end it is really worth it. The combination of acting, singing and music is skillfully blended and carrys you along in an emotional cloud. It is bound to make you feel better at the end. A rare movie for all ages and persuasions.
B0017MO10U|4.0|the product met expectations.  The grandfather paradox conflict solution was not clear.  How everyone ended  up together took too much of a leap of science fiction faith.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|It was received as described. I was looking for this edition in other places and found here in Amazon. Good price and excellent delivery service.
032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby books are my favorites!  Scott answers all of my questions at the exact moment I have them.  It is like talking to a friend.  Yes, his humour at times drags you down BUT you can always just skip the first chapter of each section and ta da, you have everything you need without the distractions. (or read the whole thing and chuckle away).  Amazing color photos. Tricks and hints abound in this book and volume 2.  I highly recommend any beginner and advance photo bugs out there to buy these two volumes.  I read them both very quickly and use them for constant reference.
031606792X|5.0|Stephenie Meyer has taken us through an amazing saga in one of the most original vampire worlds yet...she has created an intricate world of vampires than has never existed.  If you think you have read all there is to read about vampires, guess again, Meyer's vampires are unique, complex and delicate in a way than makes them likable and heroic.  I have yet to finished the book but I can not keep it down, you will be surprise page after page while she takes you through a journey full of love, pain, and friendship with a vampire twist.
B00000JPH6|4.0|One of my favorite movies, great for the kids and not bad for an 80's flick.
B0011HF6GE|1.0|The review title says it all.  His singing is some monotone falsetto.  Probably thinks he neither has to sing or enunciate because what he says is so profound.  Saw him singing on YouTube also.  Looks as if he rolled in that puddle that is the album cover six months ago & is mildewing through.  You should be embarassed to buy this album.
031606792X|5.0|I pre-prdered the fourth instalment of the Twilight Saga, \\"Breaking Dawn\\" about 2 weeks before it was released. It was promptly delivered to my front door the day I was told, the price was unbeatable, and it was in perfect condition. Not a scratch or mark.
B000ANVPPQ|3.0|This was a fun movie when I was young, and still is.  It really is pretty sexist by today's standards, but still enjoyable to watch.
B000VSBX34|5.0|It's 43 years since the release of this film and you almost wouldn't know it.  The music is still magnificent, the plot is still hilarious, and the extras make it all the more worthwhile, even if your kids are astonished to discover that Paul McCartney was in another band before Wings.    The plot is fairly simple:  Ringo is wearing a ring (which he can't seem to get off of his finger) that marks him as the next victim to be sacrificed for the sake of an obscure eastern religion.  Besides being pursued by the leader and various followers of that odd group, he is being pursued by two mad scientists who want the ring because they believe its unusual properties will allow them to rule the world.  In the telling of the story we're treated to all manner of aural and visual puns, social commentary, and extraordinary music that has lasted all these years without becoming an embarrassment to the memory.    It's sad to think we no longer have John Lennon and George Harrison with us in life, but I'm glad there is this beautifully preserved film along with commentary.
0307346617|4.0|This follow-up to the Zombie Survival Guide is less campy but some of the survivor interviews contain just enough snark to make you shake your head in amusement.  One aspect that is fun is the interviewer narrating his own actions, typically in response to questions from the interviewee.<br /><br />You get so many different types of people answering questions about their time during the war that you will no doubt have some you hate and some you love.  There is a smattering of all types of people being interviewed and if you cross one that doesn't float your boat then you know it'll be over in a couple of pages.  This isn't the type of book that has you getting attached to any characters, it is more like a voyeuristic pleasure of other people's misfortune.

B0000844MR|5.0|The Skeksis think there dark rule is complete and that they had snuffed out the only hope that the world has for being spared an eternity in darkness, but the young hero has been hidden away, saved from the slaughter of his kind, the Gelflings.  Throughout his journey you encounter strange and wonderful creatures and sinister ones as well, making The Dark Crystal, a classic fantasy film for the young or young at heart.  Jim Henson's creatures are always fun to watch. and this is no exception.  The characters and story are very immersing, making you want more as each moment unfolds.  A wonderful tale showing what can happen when one party tries to harshly take control of a land and all of it's people, and how the smallest glimmer of hope can transform the gravest situation.  I admit that it may date me in many respects, but something will eventually date us all, but I still love this film at 30 years old.  The movie in Superbit, with optimized DVD quality and sound is a great find for those who enjoy fantasy films, and Jim Henson.  In closing I would say this is probably my favorite Henson film.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I am a Wal-Mart associate and an excerpt was playing of River deep - Mountain high . It will stop you in your tracks! I have been a Celine Dion fan for years. I have always known Celine was a classy lady , but ; my opinion of her as down to earth person - approachable , warm , a true entertainerhas grown . The way the show was put together was absolutely beatiful , elegant , ( If I Could ) to steamy , erotic (Seduces Me) and the thrilling finale ( River Deep - Mountain High ) will make you want to dance . Go out and get it . You will not be disappointed !!!!!
B000YAA68C|2.0|I personally did not care for this movie as it seems to be really slow.  This movie would be good for someone who has lost a wife or husband, not so much for just an average viewer.  Hillary Swank was not able in my opinion to bring the emotion to the film that was needed.
1400079276|4.0|I've heard and read of this mythic Haruki Murakami fellow before reading this book. I thought it would be a nice, summer read when I picked it up at a used bookstore in my neighborhood. At the end of the book, I was a little annoyed and regretful of finally discovering Murakami for myself. I was annoyed because the story was so absorbing and bizzare that I couldn't stop reading it. I just read it and read it for two straight days during the weekend, thus distracting me from graduate school-mandated reading that I really should've been doing.    But anyway, the book was fascinating and extremely engaging. The only other Japanese writer I've read previously was Banana Yoshimoto. I found Murakami's and Yoshimoto's styles similar yet distinct. Both have a simple (but not simplistic) narrative style and is enchanting and not excessively difficult to follow. In this book, Murakami's use of imagery and symbolism is complex, but not so complex to the point of being inexplicable. Even though there are two parallel and separate stories/characters that we are following, the book's flow is smooth and not choppy at all. Although it felt like Murakami himself didn't even know where the story was leading us to for most of the book, it was so addicting that I was just strung along willingly through the maze-like journeys of both protagonists.    All the characters in the book are charmingly flawed and human. Despite the extraordinary circumstances, some of which border on being fantastical and science fiction-y, it is very easy to like and empathize with the characters. There are many loose ends at the end of the story, but somehow, I found that it is still satisfying and did not disappoint. Besides being hooked on to Murakami, my only other regret is that I didn't start reading Murakami earlier.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|It's great to see Rob back and you can tell they really gave it there all on this album.  This album should be marked as a classic for most Priest fans.  The album starts off with a classic metal guitar riff with Judas Rising then the powerhouse drums kick in and it gets real heavy. And we hear Rob's scream over the music with powerhouse vocals.  Deal With The Devil is a great rocker which talks about the beginning of the band as they started out playing in a church of holy Joseph.  This one will get your adrenaline flowing.  Revolution rocks and in this one Rob sounds kind of sinister which only adds greatness to the song.  I love Worth Fighting For.  If it's not my favorite it's definetly one of my favorites.  This songs sounds like a pretty cool chil metal song.  Demonizer is vicious rocker with powerhouse screaming from Rob.  Wheels Of Fire keeps the album in a great direction.  Another classic from this album.  nice rhytehm and lead guitar parts here.  Angel is a ballad and this is where the album kind of crashes.  I don't like ballads and I find this song boring so I usualy skip it.  Hellrider picks up the heavy adrenaline pace again but this song isn't one of my favorites.  Eulogy is another slow piece but I really like the guitar line on this one and it is only about 3 minutes long.  Lochness is bland sounding to me.  Parts of it sound cool because I picture a castle when I hear it but I find most of it boring and it just goes on a little too long.  As far as the great songs go they more then make up for the not so good songs and this should be ranked with the other classic Priest albums.  If you're a metalhead or Priesthead and you don't have this album yet you really need it.  It's just as essential as Sin After Sin in my opinion.

0756404746|5.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book.  I did not want it to end.   Most of the series that I've read lately made me feel that I just wanted to finish them to find out how they ended.  There was very little joy in the reading.  That was not at all the case with this book.  I've only read the first book of the trilogy, and already I'm disappointed that there are only 3 books planned so far.      The author reportedly spent many years revising and refining this book.  It shows.  This is one of the most finely executed fantasy novels that I've read in years.    Most of the book is told from a single perspective.  This is refreshing when it seems that most modern authors are trying to jam so many different perspectives and sub-plots into their novels that it almost becomes necessary to take notes.      I don't always mind clichés in my fantasy novels, but am pleasantly surprised when they are avoided. This book is refreshingly cliché-free.  We get foreshadowing without prophecy. We get an unreliable narrator, which is almost unheard of in this genre.  We get a love interest and protagonists that are obviously imperfect, and are (probably not) going to turn out to be royalty in disguise.    Nothing makes me drop a book faster than tedious, pointless world building.  I am perfectly happy with a mutable, detail-free Nehwon. Some of the other reviews have objected to the level of detail in this book - currency details, for instance. I disagree with these reviews. Although there is a fair amount of world building going on here, it is always relevant to the plot. The geography descriptions are appropriate because they have a direct bearing on the story.  The currency is important to the actions and motivations of the characters.  The internal logic explained in the descriptions of magic and sciences provide just enough detail to provide context and framework.    Good characterization is vital to my enjoyment of a book. If I don't care about the characters, why would I care to spend my time finding out what's going to happen to them?  But, at the same time, this can be taken too far.  I read books to escape, to meet new characters and follow them through challenges and trials.  I don't want to spend 500 pages reading about a character's innermost thoughts and fears while they muddle their way through courtly politics and political maneuvering.  I want action and plot development. This book strikes a good balance between the two. There was enough action to keep me interested, and enough characterization to make me care.  I want to find out what happens to these characters in the next books.    I highly recommend this book - so much so that I will be buying copies for my friends and family to give as gifts.
031606792X|5.0|I dont know why everyone is complaining, the only complaint that I have is that Midnight Sun is not completed yet. I have become totally obsessed with this series, and now I am ready for more. I read this book in two days. I would have read it in one if I did not have to sleep. Everything that I wished for since \\"Twilight\\" happened. All that I could have asked differently is that Bella would have gotten to be immortal a little while longer. That is why we need MORE!!! Some of us Die Hard fans need to have more Edward and Bella as an immortal couple. I am very disappointed that so many people did not like this particular book. It was too short, now I find myself searching for another story that compares to this saga. Dont beleive all of the posts. This book is definately worth reading if you have read the other three, and especially if you desire more of the story.
159102594X|4.0|This review is for the trilogy, rather than the individual books.  I feel that this is a particularly relevant way to approach this series, because it is consistent throughout the series in tone and characterization.      This is a dark, gritty and well-written fantasy series full of gore, violence and believable characters. I've read quite a few reviews that refer to it as \\"ground-breaking\\", which I do not believe it is - Glenn Cook was writing dark, gritty fantasy more than 20 years ago (take a look at his Black Company series, especially).  George R.R. Martin has, of course re-popularized this sub-genre.  Unlike George R.R. Martin however, Abercrombie has managed to maintain his focus, and created a coherent, epic story contained within a single trilogy.    The characters are very well realized. There are no 2-dimensional cutout characters here.  They have aspirations, motivations and baggage.  Each choice they make has a logical series of consequences, some of which are unexpected, but never unbelievable.      A few of the reviewers have complained that the ending is too dark.  I disagree, the ending was appropriate for the dark, rich world that Joe Abercrombie has created.  This is not Sleeping Beauty's happily ever after world, this is a world where the characters have to live with their consciences, and the villains are not so different than the heroes.    The series is jam-packed with action, and not of the boring-this-battle-has-so-many-details-that-I-can't-even-remember-what-I-just-read variety.  The fight scenes are gritty and horrific; the protagonists are scarred and fallible.    I highly recommend this series.
B00000K3D4|3.0|Even though I like David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly, I think the movie would have been better if their characters had been puppets, also. The puppets themselves are pure Henson and, as such, amazing. Felt that the storyline could have used a bit more spice to it as it tended to drag in places. A good movie to check out the puppets, but The Dark Crystal would be a better choice.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I have seen John Mayer three times in concert and he is amazing. This CD/DVD really highlight that. This would have been a great show to see. He does a few songs acoustically (Neon, Stop This Train, In Your Atmosphere, Daughters, Free Falling (from Tom Petty fame)), then brings out the John Mayer Trio for a set (Everyday I Have The Blues, Wait Until Tomorrow, Who Did You Think I Was, Come When I Call, Good Love Is On The Way, Out Of My Mind, Vultures, Bold As Love). Finally the whole band plays a third set (Waiting On The World To Change, Slow Dancing In A Burning Room, Why Georgia, The Heart Of Live, I Don't Need No Doctor, Gravity, I Don't Trust Myself, Belief, I'm Gonna Find Another You) . All told there are 22 songs.   My favorites are Who Did You Think I Was, Gravity, Waiting On The World To Change and Good Love Is On The Way. The band, either John Mayer Trio or his regular band are fabulous. If you like John Mayer, you'll love this CD/DVD!
0064431622|2.0|My son liked the colors in this book but it did not hold his interest as the others by Eric Carle.  All in all this book was a disappointment.
6304806434|3.0|It's full of entertaining actions and lots of explosions. Don't expect logic from the plot. Over-the top but good acting.
0743298039|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful.  It is full of mystery and ghosts.  A modern gothic novel.  The author's descriptions of what happens when reading are all too true.  This is a book I will gladly recommend to everyone and I can't wait for the author's next book.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|The crash scenes might look great in the 70s but they look clumsy compared to today's standards. The dialogs and the acting are stiff.    Although I bought it from Wal-Mart for only five dollars, I still think it's a total waste of money.
031606792X|4.0|I hate to say it, but I agree with the PUblisher's Weekly review.  I loved, loved, loved Twilight and New Moon.  I liked Eclipse and I'm not sure about Breaking Dawn.  I think I liked it.  It's just that I had the feeling that the first part of the book (Book 1) was rushed.  Like the author just wanted to get all the preliminaries out of the way.  Or maybe she was rushed by a deadline.  Then after Bella changes it was nearly impossible to relate or identify with her at all.  I understand Stephenie Meyers' viewpoint that she always tries to get her fans what they want, and Bella got everything her fans always wondered about.  She got Edward and a baby and Jacob imprinted.  But there was a disconnect to the book.  I didn't feel a part of it.  I was simply a reader of someone elses life.  I think perhaps the book would have been better if it was taken slowly in two books instead of one.  Although there was conflict with the Volturi, it didn't have the feel of immenant danger.  And the whole Bella is a sheild thing was just silly to me.      In summary, stick with Twilight and New Moon.  They have all of the emotion that seems to be lacking in Breaking Dawn.  Somewhat of a disappointment.
B00005JLWN|1.0|Special effects might be good at that time but not good compared to movies of the last 3 years + So so acting + Typical plot = Not good.

B00000G3PA|1.0|This movie is over hyped. It's boring after 15 minutes into the movie. There's nothing exciting. It's also illogical.
0439882826|5.0|This product was in mint condition, pckaged professionally and shipped quickly. Overall very pleased with purchase, especially considering the money I saved orderering it online.The book itself is very entertaining for children and adults alike. I would be careful letting a child under the age of 4 get a hold of it alone as the pop-ups are numerous and intricate. They would probably destroy the book.
B00005JNJV|2.0|It contains a lot of action. However, it does not appeal to me. The acting is not engaging. I don't feel related to the plot. I prefer Spiderman 2.
B0019MQBJW|5.0|To date this Blu-ray performance of Tchaikowsky's Swan Lake is the best I have seen!  Rudolf Nureyev's professional direction is an art to behold.  The dancers' choreography is balanced and symetrical as well as easily understandable.  Also, if desired, infrequent English subtitles help clarify the story line.  Absolutely enchanting!
1595478728|5.0|Chesterton's Orthodoxy is a book that all thinking Christians should read.  If you are like me, you may have begun a foray into rational Christianity that took you deep into the academic fray.  You find that you CAN defend your faith logically, that Christians need not be afraid of the syllogism.  But if you dive deep into the works of Plantinga, Moreland, Willard and such, you find yourself needing to come up for air.  This is the book that will be like an oxygen tank; it will allow you to breathe in the depths.<br /><br />The truth is that rational thought is a gift of God.  But when we live life, our rationale at times ceases to provide explanation for every event.  We discover that our vocabulary is not able to stretch far enough to describe the most precious moments of our lives.  Chesterton encapsulates this truth better than any writer I've run across yet.  He gives us permission to enjoy the tumultuous sea that the rationalist seeks to map, dissect and explain.<br /><br />I find the comments of one of the previous reviewers to be specifically illustrative.  He states, \\"Much like a gorgeous flower it is best to view it than ingest it.\\"  This reveals to us that he didn't really get the point of Chesterton's writing.  What kind of person wants to eat a gorgeous flower rather than look at it?  Modern and post-modern thinkers have lost their love for the mysterious.  They have drifted so far away that gorgeous flowers cease to be nourishment for the soul and are thought only of as food for the stomach.  This is the bankruptcy of which Chesterton writes.  I discuss this fact in my podcast, Christian With A Brain.  This book was one of my primary sources for a study called, The Limits of Logic.<br /><br />For those thinkers that love to dissect, remember that in order to properly dissect something, you must first kill it.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|What do you look for in a STAR WARS DVD?    I have some friends who several years ago were visiting China and saw that the STAR WARS Trilogy was available there on DVD.  This was almost a year before it was available in the United States.  My friends didn't care that it came with Chinese subtitles.  They just wanted STAR WARS on DVD and couldn't wait for a U.S. edition.    Likewise, there were many people like myself who simply wanted just the original movies that we saw in theaters as kids -- the original movies on DVD.  If George Lucas wanted to throw in an extra special edition disc, or making-of, or what-have-you, then that would be fine.  But that's why I didn't rush out and buy the STAR WARS Trilogy when it was first released -- because I knew it was not going to be the real STAR WARS.  And I knew that eventually Lucas would release the originals.  And I was willing to wait it out.    Is there another version which may someday catch my eye?  Perhaps.  I wouldn't mind owning a STAR WARS edition that contained all of the edited footage between Luke and Biggs on Tatooine.  Or perhaps they may one day decide to re-do the Han Solo/Jabba the Hutt scene with a Jabba that looks like Jabba in RETURN OF THE JEDI.  So, as far as \\"special editions\\" are concerned, I have no problem with adding new stuff, as long as it is the stuff that was originally filmed and not some useless musical number in Jabba the Hutt's palace (i.e. RETURN OF THE JEDI).    I suppose the best news is for those who enjoy having the movies revamped and \\"technologically updated\\" every few years.  Because George Lucas doesn't seem to be slowing down in that area at all.  He simply will not leave well enough alone.    But one thing that I hope will never change is the end.  STAR WAR EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE must always end with a victorious applause for our heroes.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|It's a short album, but it's okay.  This is a compact album with a lot of familiar tones that are expected from Portishead, but they do branch off with new ideas and unchartered waters.  For those who have not yet heard Portishead, then I strongly suggest holding off from this album until you hear their first two.
0788805843|4.0|This movie is entertaining and has a wonderful moral lesson in the end.  I bought it for my toddlers, and although it contains stimulating animation, they did not enjoy all the battles Hercules had to endure.  It is a movie based on the mythical hero, but completely incorrect from an historic point of view.  Maybe my kiddos will like it a bit more in a couple of years.
6305648522|5.0|This was my favorite film before I bought it, and it is still my #1.
078322737X|5.0|American Graffitti, released in 1974, takes place near Modesto California where George Lucas (the films director and co-writer) spent his high school years. One of Lucas's stated purposes in making this film was to document the practice of \\"cruising.\\" For those of us that didn't grow up in that era cruising basically consists of driving around town all night looking for something to do. A practice unthinkable for most of us now thanks to gas prices. The whole town seems to revolve around doing everything in a car. The drive in movies, the diner that you eat in your car at (Sonic is the modern equivalent), and the secluded outdoor area where everyone goes to \\"park.\\" One of the films funniest plots revolves around Terry (Charles Martin Smith) who is usually carless being lent a car by a friend and jumping into a world that he is wholly unprepared for.           The entire film takes place in the space of one night, the night before Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) are supposed to leave for college. The movie takes pains to show us what a solitary figure Curt is. He is shown at the school dance walking in a dark hall by himself, he is sitting alone on a car watching storefront television, he is the only main character to sit in the back seat of a car (usually by himself). Curt has relationships and interactions but they are very brief in nature. Throughout the course of the film the characters are defined by their relationships. Steve is trying to figure out what to do with his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) who cannot come to college because she is still a junior in high school. John Milner (Paul Lemat) is the local hot rod legend that accidently picks up Carol (Mackenzie Philips) a girl perhaps 13 or 14 years old.  Terry in the course of his only night with a car picks up Debbie (Candy Clark in an Oscar nominated role) who is the cause of most of the \\"fun\\" that Terry has to endure.     All of these relationships have their touching moments butnone like the unlikely pair of John and Carol. At first very antagonist John reveals himself to be full of empathy and seems to understand that no matter what she says Carol worships the ground he walks on. He condescends to be worshiped and in one moment after she angrily leaves his car, he drives around looking for her worried and arrives to rescue her from a car full of hecklers.    Since everyone is in their cars the whole night and they all have their windows down and their radios blaring, classic rock seems to pulse in every scene. There are several instances of superior sound design one in which a character runs through the streets and \\"Barbara Ann\\" flies out cars as they go by, simultaneously sounding exactly as it would in real life but also acting as a comment on the excitement the character is feeling. The music really is the heartbeat of the film and gives the whole story a rhythm. This omnipresence of the radio broadcast lends an almost God like status to the local disc jockey Wolfman Jack.  The Wolfman represents everything that teenager's value. He makes prank calls, stays up all night, blasts rock and roll and has worked his way into adolescent mythology as an outlaw who broadcasts variously from Mexico and a plane that flies constantly around the country. In the course of the story the Wolfman will be unveiled as a normal person in a scene that is often compared to the famous \\"Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!\\" scene in the Wizard of Oz.    American Graffitti on the surface is just a teen comedy but the portrayl of adolescence is so blindingly accurate that it touches a cord with many people that see it over the years despite not sharing some of the cultural trappings. For me it inspires a personal longing for days gone by. The ending is bittersweet and the epilogue brings home the feeling that we all have when we learn that friends are mortal and that all things come to an end.        An excellent film and George Lucas's best outingas a director.
B000053VAF|5.0|I almost didn't watch this movie when it came on TV because of the scenario: 2 angels must be stopped before they destroy the world. I ain't Oprah and I ain't into no angels. But, I DID watch it and it was GREAT! This movie reflects my EXACT view of \\"the religion thing\\". It's a fantastic movie and anyone who's thought about the subject of religion and is honest about it will love it too. Only thing - probably should shoo the kids out of the room. The language used ain't no \\"Thee\\" and \\"Thou\\".
031606792X|5.0|I fell in love with this book by the first chapter. Seriously, one of the best books ever.
1582701709|1.0|Okay, somewhere in this 'blockbuster' book, we should hear that, right?  Well sort of.  But do it because of the expected reward not for the act itself.  When I see this book being roundly endorsed by thousands of people, it makes me wonder where we have gone wrong in our thinking. Yes, horribly wrong.    As a believer in and teacher of positive thinking and PMA, it makes me sick to think \\"The Secret\\" is being compared with the writings of Maxwell Maltz, W. Clement Stone, Dale Carnegie, or Earl Nightingale.  I am THOROUGHLY acquainted with these gentlemen's works and there is not one place where they say or imply that a victim of tragedy is to blame for the occurence.  Not one.    But according to Ms. Byrne, those killed by suicide bombers on 9/11 attracted that tragedy.  As well as those with AIDS, those who have been raped, those with cancer, victims of molestation, victims of tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, famines, oppresive governments, dictatorships, etc.  And here people are literally buying that notion.  But let's go deeper.    If we adopt the ideas of \\"The Secret\\" then when someone is hurt profoundly by life in whatever form, we can sit back and say 'Well, after all they attracted it to themselves.\\"  We don't have to care.  We don't have to empathize or sympathize, and we get the feeling of being superior because, after all, that didn't happen to us.    Going deeper still, where would we be as a society if everyone practiced \\"The Secret?\\"  There would be no fire or police officers.  Too negative.  Ditto doctors, psychologists, and clergy.  Why?  The answer is obvious.  There is a lot of 'negativity' connected with those professions and vocations.  And according to Byrne, we shouldn't look at what we don't want to manifest in our own lives.  Same with non-professionals.  See someone drowning?  Turn your head.  Don't let the negativity be part of your conciousness.  See a homeless person?  Turn away-don't be part of what you don't want to see manifested in your life.    Does it get any meaner than that?  And to think that so-called motivational gurus like Bob Proctor, Denis Waitley, and others signed onto this teaching shows me how low they will go for a buck.  The blatant selfishness and insensitivity of the book/DVD is sickening.  As a matter of fact, it amazes me that Rhonda Byrne can lay her head on the pillow at night.  I suppose a fat back account makes up for it.     If you want true motivation and inspiration consider these: \\"You may have failed but that does not make you a failure any more than striking the wrong key on a typewriter makes it worthless\\"-Maxwell Maltz.  \\"Change your thoughts and you change your world\\"-Norman Vincent Peale.  \\"Conceive it, believe it, and achieve it\\"-W. Clement Stone.  \\"We become what we think about\\"-Earl Nightingale. \\"Your greatest power lies in your ability to choose.\\"-J. Martin Kohe.  \\"The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind.\\"-William James.    None of the above-mentioned people have DVD's with smoke, hundred foot genies, magic lamps, or special effects as does \\"The Secret.\\"  What they DO offer is truly practical and sincere advice for bettering your life and the lives of those with whom you come into contact.  The law of attraction as Rhonda Byrne describes it is a bogus ripoff of the great thinkers of the past with her cartoonish spin on it.    In an increasingly coarse and hardened world all of us DO need inspiration and to learn to use our minds and change our attitudes.  What we don't need is anything which encourages us to think less and less of other people and treat their suffering as something self-inflicted thereby diminishing not only their pain, but their humanity.  Even religious fundamentalists are kinder in attributing suffering to a devil or demons.  And believe me, there is not very much kindness in a fundamentalist/literalist.    So as far as this book goes?  Pass it by.  It's hype, trickery, mumbo-jumbo, and snake-oil.  It is the product of brilliant marketing and an author who has perveted some of the worlds greatest ideas.  The corruption of great philosophies and ideas would be bad enough, but this book is also cruel at its very essence.
0061537934|5.0|This book is such a great read.  If you've ever owned a dog, you must read this book.  The view from the dog is just perfect.  It's scary.  I think Mr. Stein really was reincarnated!  Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Such a sad and heroic tale!
0670451495|5.0|I haven't actually read this book in many years but it was a favorite of mine as a child.  I remember my mother reading it to me night after night after night and then taking a trip into Boston to see all of the places mentioned.  It's a great story and the illustrations are beautiful.  I now use it as a gift for new moms to read to their children.
0099489988|3.0|This book really wants to go somewhere but never arrives. The characters were either two-dimensional, unlikeable or thinly written caricatures. The plot seems to wind around to nowhere. Even the main conflict turns out to end in a whiney shouting match that left me thinking...\\"is that it?\\" I was only mildly interested in what would happen at the end. This is not a book I could ever recommend to my girlfriends. Too dull and goes nowhere. Some of the dialog was amusing so I gave it 3-stars instead of 2.
0061537934|5.0|I bought this is audio to listen on the way to work.  Great story.
015206396X|4.0|I received this book from Amazon's vine program.  They warn that arc's (advanced readers copies) often have small editing issues and those are not to be commented on,  rather look at plot and characterization.  If there were small editing issues,  I didn't see them,  because I was swept up in the plot and characterizations.  In the seven kingdoms,  people born with 'graced' powers - magical enhancements - usually belong to the king.  Graced people are known by their dual colored eyes and most of the regular folk won't meet a gracelings eyes...<br /><br />Some graced powers are more useful than others,  but Katsa, the King's niece, revealed herself as a killer when she was 8,  and the king then isolated and treated her as his rabid dog assassin since then,  using her skills to enhance his power.<br /><br />There were lots of interesting ideas and the magic was so entrenched in this world,  it felt natural and real,  rather than something grafted on.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  Someone commented that it felt like a Young Adult's book, and I can see where they are coming from, this book does not have the density or complexity of George RR Martin's Ice and Fire series.  However I really enjoyed this book and definitely look forward to reading the next one.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|This movie was really great. Made all the other Batman movies look trite. It all felt really real.
B00003CXAA|5.0|In July, I watched the Godfather trilogy in one sitting, which is the way I would suggest to anyone that wants to see this great film, as a very long 8 hour movie. What did I like so much about it? For me and I may just be weird in this, the story is about the modern business model, and what can go wrong. It is also about how a mostly good man can make by ever so small of a gesture towards the evil choice can be eventually sucked into being what he swore he would not. And finally it is a warning about how one can lose what is most important simply by trying to protect them. Want to know how I got there?<br /><br />One reoccurring theme that is highlighted in this saga, is explained very well in a book by Business Ethicist Quinn G. McKay Bottom Line On Integrity, The in which he discusses the Law of Obligation. Which means (and here's the short version) when you accept a favor or gift, you still in fact enter into a social contract \\"I gave, you accepted, so you owe.\\" In the Godfather, Don Vito is always performing a \\"service\\" for someone that will be repaid at some future date with a service that will be named later. As baby boomers we grew up with \\"I'm sorry I can't accept that, but thank you\\" as our parents taught us this law. This applies to favors as well as material things. It's not that we shouldn't accept gifts or favors; they are part of the social compact that hold societies, but businesses and institutions often have rules about what kind of gifts are allowed to be accepted by employee, and still we see time after time scandals involving politicians and CEO's or prison guards; what have you. Employers should also realize that to an extent, the same goes for a hired service, if you pay an employee less respect or compensation than is prudent for what he provides as a service for you, you have in effect broken you social contract with that employee.<br /><br />Which brings me to my next point, if an employer treats an employee with disrespect, he has violated the \\"No A******e Rule\\" Brilliantly illustrated in the book by the same name by Robert I. Sutton. Don Michael finds this to be the case with both his brother Alfredo, and his sister Connie's husband , and when you violate the rule... You must be prepared to pay the A*****e Tax. In the case of this saga, the tax is paid with betrayal. In real life, betrayal can come in many forms.<br /><br />Another concept illustrated in the saga is the concept of the \\"Tipping Point\\" the study in another great book by Malcolm Gladwell, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference . That investigates how trends change. For business, it is a valuable thing to understand. In the Godfather Saga, the Corleone Dons both understood, this concept, seeing what certain business changes would do to the neighborhood, family, and business, but at the same time not seeing what the consequence would be in bucking the business trend.<br /><br />Finally, it ask the question \\"is it worth it\\"? A popular American maxim in the 60's was \\"No other success can compensate for failure in the home\\". In the end of the saga, Don Michael tells his ex-wife, I never wanted this Business, I only wanted to protect my family, and in the end I lost them anyway\\". I often am troubled by the hours I am away from my family, trying to \\"protect them\\", to provide for them etc. and I often wonder, what we could do without, if I could spend more time at home, would we in the end be better off?

0307455874|3.0|I must add that Mr. Obama is a great speaker but in the end he sounds like a politician dreaming of Utopia with a past touching every walk of life to give him a superior in depth view of ....everything.  Although I am no fan of Mr. Obama, I did enjoy reading this book.  In the end what did I get out of this book? Alot of babble about his life and experiences and what/why he thinks as he does.  I haven't to date heard any definitive statements from Obama on what he stands for other that against the war in Iraq, pro-choice, and in favor of taxes.  I'm more interested in a person with great ideas-------BUT moreover ways to get to an endpoint, not muddle around in the hypothetical and no true solutions (just questions about what the problem currently is).  Spit it out Mr. Obama......please!!  There are many great points about how and why he thinks but in the end, I see an empty suit as many other politicians that speak of change.  I recommend the book for an uplifting view of his life without many negative facts or true insights into his inner conflicts.  We all need to be more educated about politicians; this book  is just FLUFF.  Good read to better understand Mr. Obama and see, he stands for everything, but nothing in the end.  Don't ask him a yes or no question because we will get another book about his life.  Obama Nation is also another interesting book about Mr. Obama.  Different but nonetheless interesting.  It seems all of America is looking for a modern day Patton dressed as Ghandi to be the next president, Mr. Obama is neither.  Read this book and you may agree.....or disagree.
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|Katy Perry may have started her career in the Christian genre, but this alt-pop goddess soars on her mainstream debut in the form of One of the Boys.  Her smash single \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" is one of the catchiest songs this summer, and surely received most of its attention due to its off topic subject matter.  \\"Ur So Gay\\" is another gem, albeit not nearly as catchy melodically, but more so lyrically as Perry lists all the reasons her ex is \\"so gay\\" even though \\"you don't even like boys\\"; I personally don't find any anti-homosexuality remarks here, but obviously songs like this have grabbed attention from those in the homosexual community for usage of the \\"Ur So Gay\\" moniker.  But \\"Hot & Cold\\" stands to be just as catchy, if not more, than \\"I Kissed a Girl.\\"  One of the Boys is simply a delight to the ears, a piece of rock-infused pop that displays a powerful voice intermixed with some great songs.  Sure, not everything here can match the incredible heights of \\"I Kissed a Girl,\\" and yet moments of brilliance permeate throughout: for example, \\"Thinking of You\\" is a powerful ballad of heartbreak with a driving bridge and knowing lyrics.  Overall, One of the Boys can easily be considered one of the best pop albums of the year, and deservedly so.
031606792X|1.0|I'm a huge huge fan of Meyer - I gave Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse five stars each and four stars to The Host.  I had great expectations from Breaking Dawn; looking forward to an emotional, explosive and compelling read.  What I got was a bland, boring and lengthy book.    The marriage, the sex and the birth take up most of the book.  The time Edward and Bella spend on the island does not bring across the romance as strongly as it was projected in Twilight.  Jacob and Bella's relationship is not as interesting as it was in New Moon.  The conflict between Edward and Jacob over Bella is suddenly non-existent (I was sickened when Edward asks Jake to share Bella with him, if she wanted a baby that badly.  I mean is there no limit where sacrifice is concerned in Meyer's novels!!!).  Also, Renesmee is born conveniently so Jake can imprint on her - regardless of how bizarre it would be when Bella / Edward / Jake might have explain all those kisses shared between Bella & Jake.    It feels as if, after writing three mindblowing novels, Meyer had no more story to tell.  Like her imagination has been exhausted or something - where this series is concerned at least.  She was just burning up pages with mediocre scenes, lengthening the book unnecessarily.  I truly believe she should've ended the book at Eclipse, with a more defined ending.  This book belies all the previous notions that she ingrained in her readers - i.e. vampires are frozen in time and considered undead.  So how does a male vampire produce sperm when his body can't even produce blood?  This book is so distorted in fact that there is no longer any resemblance to the previous books.  I did wonder quite a few times if it was actually written by SM or did they hire a ghostwriter to create this mess and asked SM to fill in the blanks?    Once more thing I missed was Edward in this book.  His role was sidelined and the old Edward was totally non-existent.  Bella was no longer the same either - but maybe that was because she changed to vampire.  Even Jake did not feel like Jake anymore!!!  I could not relate to any of the characters in this book - maybe there was an invasion of the body snatchers from the Host in this book.    I am sorely disappointed and disillusioned.  All my wishes for a dynamic read have been crushed!  In fact, I am upset with myself for even buying it in the first place.  I know you'll buy it regardless of the reviews (like I did), if you're a diehard fan, but be prepared to be astonished - and not in a positive manner either.
0740748475|5.0|This is a really good set of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons. The bound form makes it more durable. Definitely a buy to keep.
031606792X|5.0|Ok...for those of you who havent read this book and are thinking of getting it, trust me you wont be dissapointed! But before you read this read the first 3 please. Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse.   Stephenie Meyer truely outdid herself with this final book to her amazing series. When I first got it I was nervous about how she was going to end it. But having read this book im completely satisfied with this wonderful ending. I wont give out any spoilers, and I wont go into detail about this book. All I can say is this book is far too good to pass up. Read it and you'll love it forever, dont read it and you'll forever wonder why so many people all over the world are head over heels for this series. Thank you Stephenie for an ending thats left me happy and satisfied for Bella and her amazing family.
031606792X|5.0|I loved Breaking Dawn and was both incredibly happy and sad when I finished it. I was sad that it was the end of Twilight Saga, but I was thrilled that Edward and Bella finally got their happy ending.     Some people say that this story was far-fetched. This is a story about vampires, people! If you haven't read any spoilers, there are many unexpected surprises in the book.     For those of you who would like to know how the tale ends, I would highly suggest reading this book. You will not be disappointed. For those who prefer to drawn their own conclusions about the fates of Edward, Bella and Jacob, maybe you should stop reading at Eclipse. Either way, I am happy with the way Stephenie Meyer chose to end this amazing saga - it is, after all, her story to tell.
0793518326|1.0|I waited for this book with great anticipation being a serious Beatles fan. When it arrived I found it quite incredulous. Correct me if I am wrong but is not the purpose of MUSIC to be able to read and play it?    Regardless of the technical merits you need a MAGNIFYING glass to read these musical scores. As a lead guitarist I found it impossible to read these scores without one. How the hell are you supposed to hold a magnifying glass whilst playing the guitar simultaneously?    I sent a stern email to the publishers asking exactly how they had misfired so badly and asked what they intended to do about this debacle. They replied with a \\"We will send your comments to the editorial team\\". Exactly what would that achieve.    I then send a second email which is detailed below ....    Hi    I wrote to you last weekend adversely commenting on your quite incredible Beatles Complete score.    I advised my intention to place a copy of my comments on Amazon, whilst also requesting a detailed explanation as to the quite ridiculous size of the music score.    I still await a reply and would appreciate one within the next 24 hours. Such crass stupidity should not and cannot be ignored. The book, although very expensive, is actually worthless as it has been produced.    If I do not receive a reply Amazon will be graced with the content of my comments for potential buyers to consider.    Hiding from your responsibilities achieves nothing, have the balls to come out, admit you have conned those who have bought your product and offer a solution i.e. give them their money back or produce a compendium that musicians can actually read and play from.    Regards    Peter Woodall ........     Until such time as the producers actually consider the purpose of musical scores, I strongly advise you to keep your credit card in your wallet.    This product totally fails the \\"Sale of Goods Act\\" (in the United Kingdom)because it is \\"NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE\\" for which it was sold.    I totally wastedmy money and shall not be buying, or recommending, any of their products in future. I strongly suggest that you heed my warning and refuse to buy this totally inadequate score.[[ASIN:0793518326 The Beatles - Complete Scores]]
B0017MO10U|5.0|I have been a fan of Stargate from the beginning. This movie was excellent. I would highly recommend it.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|No one can be as simply comedic (and clean, too) in slapstick situations as Cary Grant & Katharine Hepburn! This is a good movie to watch when you just want to see ordinary people in absurd, goofy situations. It is great for 'family night' and it is great for an evening alone!    Have fun with it!
B001AMQOCA|2.0|Again the idiocy of more expensive full set DVDs. You can buy separate 5 seasons for $50 less on Amazon.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|The remastered films look and sound fantastic!  I could do without the little wallet and badge but the included booklet describing each film and it's actors is really nice.  Definitely worth the money and a fine addition to my collection.
0060254920|5.0|Sometimes we just can't seem to settle down before bed. During those times, I reach for \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" so that my two sons can roar their terrible roars and gnash their terrible teeth and roll their terrible eyes and show their terrible claws.<br /><br />The book is short -- perfect for bedtime reading -- and very interactive. The story follows Max and his wild imagination to a magical land. I use the book to reinforce in my sons that they need to settle down in the evening and not get into the type of mischief Max falls into.<br /><br />This is a great addition to your bedtime reading collection.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until my brother told me to check it out.  It was awesome!  I don't wanna sound gay or anything, but I love most Bale movies.  This movie has all the action and plot twists that you could look for.  It is also awesome because I love the 1984 storyline.
B000002HPT|2.0|2 1/2    Rightfully one of their weaker reviewed disc, the modern progressive rock behemoths's 4th studio felt like a conscious step backwards in the songwriting department, essentially dumbing down the complex and melodic metal that made the group interesting to begin with in favor of a more accessible sound. Always reliable in length at least, this release sounds stale, and nearly deadened with seemingly ancient 90's rock production cliches; the solidly mediocre onslaught is truly put in it's pathetic perspective up against the instrumental transcendence behind \\"Hells Kitchen\\" and a segment of the final blatant and futile attempt at your epic album medley closer.
B00168HARG|5.0|Terminator  The Sarah Connor Chronicles    Awesome, awesome, awesome, a DVD must for every good Sci-Fi home movie library. Sarah's Chronicles offer something old, something new and the missing links to thread the both together. Great sets, CGI and extraordinary acting, this first season is jam packed with intense riveting footage so believable it will quickly pull you in and capture you. Trained ballerina turned actress Summer Glau is powerful as Cameron, a female cyborg sent from the future to protect a computer prodigy from the evil intent of \\"Skynet.\\"      I was first memorized by Glau's acting skills in Josh Whedon's \\"Firefly\\" series. Her offbeat character in \\"Firefly\\" makes Summer Glau the perfect cyborg choice to protect young John Connor who is destined to fight machines who will take over the world in the future.     A writers strike during the first season left only 9 episodes in the can but well worth the DVD purchase. If season two is anything like the first, hold on to your hats for an edge of you seat ride.     I again need to recommend a close watch of Summer Glau's gifted acting talents. Anyone who has seen a ballet knows a story unfolds through movement and expression. Danced trained in expression and movement since a child, Glau is a leg up over the acting skills of most actresses.     Great special bonus features in and on the Blu-Ray DVD's will provide hours of cyborg food for the hungry who just can't get enough of The Sarah Connor Chronicles. Couch Potato Review: 7 Potato More.
B000JVT09C|1.0|This movie was a sad endeavor.  I saw it with a few friends of mine and we all fell asleep about 20 minutes in.  It was as dull as dull can be with the only saving grace being the special affects.  The bullet in the eye - very cool and the plane landing.  Other than that - pathetic.  And yes, you would think that someone like Bryan Singer whose X-MEN 1 and 2 were excellent could have done something great with this, however it was a train wreck.  Weak story + great special affects = bad movie.
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|I have to say that Evil Dead 2 is a great movie in popculture history, like Star Wars or the Blues Brothers. It is a great dvd to have in any collection, and in this awsome dvd case you get so much for your money. Its not only the DVD but the Necronomicon. its pages have special incantations that can be translated. the book is covered in a prosthetic rubber so it has that halloween smell to it and if you press its one good eye it screams. this is a great buy
0679720200|4.0|Oh, what does it matter if I write a review about this book or if I don't write a review about this book? Nothing will change. It won't have any affect on anything. In 100 years, I'll be dead, and what difference would it have made if I gave a writeup, or I didn't?<br /><br />Is anyone ever actually going to read my opinion? And if they do, does my opinion really matter, on a cosmic, macro level? The world will keep on turning, and the sun will keep on burning, and the universe will keep....universing.<br /><br />It doesn't even matter if you read this book or you don't; if you like it or you don't. It's just an abstract story about a guy, that never actually happened. Not that it would matter even if it had.
0374105235|5.0|Rarely has a book had such an impact on me.  Ismael Beah's epic journey from carefree childhood to inhuman adolescence to enlightened adulthood tells the story of hope for mankind. As Beah has said, it puts a human voice to the war and violence in his country of Sierra Leone, and, in the larger perspective, to all violence, war and hatred around the world.  I heard Ismael Beah speak in person yesterday at Florida Gulf Coast University where he addressed the incoming freshmen with his message of love and hope. In the tradition of his people, he is a true storyteller and he tells his story with conviction. If ever a book should be read by everyone living in today's world, this is it.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I can honestly say that I am not a huge Coldplay fan. I like some of their songs from their first two cds, found their last studio album dreadfully boring. I wasn't planning on checking out their latest effort VIVA LA VIDA (death and all his friends) but after hearing a bit of \\"Violet Hill\\" on the tv for an ad for iTunes and becoming hooked, I decided to check out the band's latest album. Much to my surprise I found myself enjoying the album. I think Brian Eno added a much needed oomph to the band. The band's songs have an atmospheric sound that I hadn't heard on previous albums but without losing that familiar Coldplay sound. Chris doesn't sound so whiney as he has in the past which makes the album all the more enjoyable for me. I think the band's strongest, more compelling songs are the first 4-6 songs. The reason for that lies in the infectious pop hooks. I think the melodies in the first half of the album is top notch and the strongest that the band has written in recent years. The only minor flaws with the album is repetition and predictability but overall I still give this album five stars. I just find myself constantly listening to it a few times a day.
0312427999|5.0|Although this is a significant read, both in length and subject matter, it is actually written so it is an easy read.  The words flowed and I have learned so much.  I recommend this book to everyone.  This is important stuff if you want to be a critical thinker when considering the news of U.S. and world events.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|I bought this DVD to get ready for The Dark Knight. I had forgotten how wonderful and riviting the movie was. Even my 96-year-old mother, who usually leaves the room when I watch any kind of action movie, enjoyed it.
B000N4SHPS|3.0|Gotta Be Willing To Take The Hits<br /><br />\\"Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life, but it ain't about how hard you can hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. It's about how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now if you know what you're worth, go out and get what your worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain't you! You're better than that!\\"<br />-Rocky.<br /><br />So this movie... is not too bad, actually. Rocky is an old dog now, still got some good mileage left, but clearly he has taken his hits, and then some. In fact he seems to be pretty much done, his glory days long since past. But of coarse we know he's got some fight left in him and watching him pull himself up by his boots straps like the all American hero is, get back into shape and get into that ring one last time(?) you may actually feel respect for this character and enjoy the film. The greatest moment comes when his son shows up and Rocky delievers a truly inspired speech that serves as the message of the film. Stallone made a decent film and heartfelt send-off for Rocky.
031606792X|1.0|I was so disappointed!!! No one could have possibly loved and read the Twilight series more than I did and do. I eagerly awaited the release, attended the bookstore party, counted down the days, only to be let down by such a hokey finale.      Part of the attraction of the Twilight series was the protective nature of Edward toward Bella. As a human, Bella was in need of protection from other vampires, and even though Bella's character could hardly be considered frail, she had a vulnerability (human weakness) that made Edward's protective character that much more attractive. Yes, we all wanted the fairy tale ending, where Bella becomes a vampire, but in Breaking Dawn once it happened, she became the hero of the book, saving everyone and in fact stronger than Edward. It became dull reading.    And really, Jacob imprinting on Bella's baby. It felt like incest to me. He was in love with Bella, and she declared her love for him in Eclipse. They shared an intimate kiss. Now he will some day have that intimate relationship with her daghter. Eww!    And Charlie accepts everything, no questions asked. Okay...whatever.     My expectations included Jacob running off with Bella before her wedding could take place. There was such a build-up of conflict. It would have been such an interesting plot if the love triangle was played out in this book. There still could have been all of the happy endings. Jacob could have imprinted on someone else. Bella could have even had her baby. But instead, all of the nonsense of the vampires around the world coming together, and Bella being the superhero vampire with such self control...boring and so far away from the romance that this series started out to be.     However, I am still a huge Twilight fan. I eagerly await the movie coming in November and the next book...Twilight from Edward's perspective...it's gonna be awesome...I just know it!!!
031606792X|4.0|If you love the Twilight series then you'll love this book.  Its the final book and it makes me a bit sad.  But anyways, its really interesting the way Meyers ends this book.  There were a few things I didn't quite like, but that is just personal preference. Overall one of my favorite books
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|WARNING: This review contains spoilers! DO NOT READ THIS UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM!    Every once in a great while a film comes along that changes everything and revolutionizes the way films are made. It happened with Fritz Lang's Metropolis, Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, Steven Spielberg's Jaws, and George Lucas' Star Wars... now we are given Andy and Larry Wachowski's The Matrix. The Matrix not only has a cool, cyberpunk, hyper stylized look and jaw-dropping special effects, it also features an intelligent story that is often overlooked by the mindless action junkies. The story unfolds at a feverish pace while we, the viewers, are given the thrill ride of a lifetime.    Thomas Anderson worked a menial desk job at a major software company. In his spare time he leads a double life as Neo, a computer hacker, and it is as Neo that he gained the attention of some very strange people. One night, after falling asleep in front of his computer, Neo wakes up to find a message flashing on the monitor. \\"Wake up, Neo... The Matrix has you... Follow the white rabbit. Knock, knock.\\" Not two seconds after reading this message, the door knocks. It's only one of Neo's friends stopping by to pick up a disc, or is it? Neo notices that his friend's girlfriend has a tattoo of a white rabbit on her shoulder, so naturally when he's invited to go to a rave he agrees out of curiosity. Once there, Neo is overwhelmed by the blaring rock music, the flashing strobe lights, and he's just considering leaving when a beautiful woman dressed in a slinky black outfit approaches him. She introduces herself as Trinity, a name that Neo is already familiar with. She's an expert hacker and an ally to Morpheus, a mysterious man that the authorities are after. Trinity tells Neo that he's in danger, that she understands him and his growing feeling of disenchantment, that she can help him, and that Morpheus can answer the question that's been eating away at his subconscious: What isthe matrix?  The next morning Neo wakes up and realizes that he's late for work. When he arrives there his boss lectures him saying, \\"You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson. You believe that you are special, that somehow the rules do not apply to you. Obviously, you are mistaken.\\" After his reprimand his day only gets worse. He receives a FedEx package containing a cellular phone, which immediately begins to ring. When he answers it he hears, for the first time, the voice of Morpheus. \\"I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately you and I have run out of time. They're coming for you and I don't know what they're going to do.\\" Over the phone Morpheus gives Neo instructions to on how to escape the building without being seen, but Neo fails to follow these instructions. He's taken into the custody of several strange agents, who interrogate him and plant him with a \\"bug\\".  Neo wakes up the next day believing that all the events of the previous day had been a dream, until he gets a phone call from Morpheus who cryptically tells Neo that he is \\"The One\\". They agree to meet at a safe location. When Trinity picks up Neo, she asks him to lift his shirt because she thinks he may be \\"bugged\\". Trinity reveals a large, awkward, high tech contraption that she uses to locate and remove the \\"bug\\". She then takes Neo to an old deserted building where he finally meets Morpheus face to face. Morpheus asks Neo if he wants to know the truth about the Matrix. He explains that no one can be told what the Matrix is, that they have to see it for themselves. Morpheus produces two pills and then offers Neo a choice: Take the blue pill and his life will return to normal, but if he takes the red pill Morpheus will reveal to him the mystery of the Matrix. Neo, with a little hesitation, takes the red pill and his world begins to dissolve, literally. The next thing he knows is that he's naked, covered with cords and wires that are plugged into his body,and that the vat of amniotic fluid he's been sleeping in is suddenly drained away, pulling him down through a series of tunnels and depositing him in a lake of waste. A large airship comes to his rescue and removes him from the grimy water. When Neo reawakens, Morpheus tells him that his entire world, his entire existence was fabricated, that he had been subjugated by an illusory reality designed to keep him compliant. The real world turns out to be a nightmare and the nightmare a reality. In the real world, the machines have long ago developed artificial intelligence, and taken over the surface of the planet as they use human beings as their energy source. The Matrix, as it turns out, is nothing more than an elaborate set of programs meant to deceive human beings so that the machines may parasitically feed off their semi-conscious bodies. Neo's life has been an empty dream world... but there is hope.  Morpheus has been leading a band of freedom fighters who live in the real world and hack into the Matrix through a pirate signal, to free humanity from the clutches of the machines. Morpheus tells Neo of a techno-mystical prophecy that one day a man will be born who will liberate humankind and end the war between the living and the mechanical. Morpheus trains Neo to become their champion in a virtual reality simulator, where Neo learns martial arts. He is also taught how to adapt his mind so that when he next enters the Matrix, he will be able to fortify himself for protection as well as bypass the laws of physics (mainly gravity). But they also face great obstacles, both in and out of the Matrix. In the real world they must deal with Sentinels, robots that are squid like in appearance and armed with a deadly arsenal. Within the Matrix, there's the threat of the Agents who eliminate any dissenters. Of these Agents, Agent Smith is the most dangerous for his programming was flawed. He is capable of experiencing human emotions such as ambition, pride, and a general contempt for all organic living things. Soon Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity have begun a revolution from which there can be no turning back. They will either end the tyranny of the machines or be crushed in the attempt.    The concept that our perceived reality is a mere illusion is by no means revolutionary. Since ancient times, philosophers and scientists have suggested the possibility of alternate realities which are only accessible through the mind. What makes The Matrix so fascinating is that it combined this metaphysical idea with modern technology, contemporary politics, social counterculture, and martial arts action. The film also has an underlying spirituality and frequently makes references to world religions and mythologies. The iconic characters are played to perfection by a talented cast including Keanu Reeves as Neo, Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity, Joe Pantoliano as Cypher, and Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. Though it was released in 1999, The Matrix has often been cited as the film that ushered in the new millennium. It is a high energy, thought provoking modern masterpiece.

B00004WIDQ|4.0|For those who love the old originals of King Kong, Mighty Joe Young,and Godzilla this one is for you.  There are pioneering forays into computer graphics , but the old story telling and adventure is there,not overwhelmed with technology!! Well acted and directed this one is not just for the sci fi folks. My only objection is that there is one or two scenes where God's Name is taken as a curse word. If you mute that you do not lose any of the story and you avoid the only part that I found objectionable.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is the best album cover ever in rock and roll history as far as I'm concerned,  the music inside is just gravy.  Nothing could top OK Computer, so Radiohead didn't even try - they very wisely went in a completely different direction into almost another genre altogether.  OK Computer is basically a straight up rock record but Kid A is pretty much electronic music.  The first song, \\"Everything in it's Right Place\\" is one of the best in Radiohead's live set - it sounds much better live is what I'm trying to say - but the studio version is still very captivating, especially with good speakers.  \\"How To Disappear Completely\\" almost matches the intensity of \\"Exit Music\\" from the previous record.  I think the peak of the record is \\"In Limbo\\", maybe the scariest song I've ever heard from a major rock band and that includes Pink Floyd.  Another thing I like about this record is that it has a character; some albums are a collection of songs with no discernable unifying theme or common identity, but on this record, from beginning to end, it is definitely Kid A.

B000PC6A3E|4.0|From a person who grew up reading about Batman comics this was a treat...in Hi-Def. While I didn't have the system to punch out the True HD-DTS, watching it in mere DTS was a thrill. This is how the Batman was meant to be seen, the serious dark side. Can't wait for the Dark Knight to come out in the same format. But for now, for those die hard lovers of the character, a must buy.
B00006J3WH|5.0|\\"Once More, With Feeling\\" is one of the best episodes of the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and certainly the best episode of the sixth season.  With both the lyrics and the score concocted by Buffy auteur Joss Whedon, this soundtrack will be on your mp3 player for years to come!  Also, it has four bonus tracks, the theme from three different episodes (one of them being the excellent, emotion filled \\"Sacrifice\\" by Christophe Beck) as well as a working-tape version of \\"Something to Sing About\\".      Any self-respecting Buffy fan should own this album.
1400082773|3.0|The young Barack Obama, going to a school in Hawaii, flips through a library book in search of information about the Luo tribe of Africa from which his Grandfather and Father are descendants. His mind has entertained thoughts of his ancestor tribe as glorious kings, adorned in colorful traditional clothes.  The book he is reading tells him that the Luo were a kind of nomadic farmers who wore a loincloth.  He leaves the book open and walks out of the library.    This incident is one of many that nicely illustrate the power and ultimate disillusionment of generational myths and how we have to reconcile truths with our affections. The author conveys a restless, impatient nature and a palpable unease with his heritage and his place in American society.      This is not a book about a presidential candidate, it was written well before the author was seriously considering even his national Senate run.  Actually, Dreams of My Father more closely hews to the conventions of 1st generation fiction, than it does to autobiography or memoir.  The author has a nice way with language, though at times he crosses to cliche and seems too enamored with the literary scenes he has constructed. In the introduction to my paperback edition, Obama admits that on the republication of the book, he was tempted to edit it down a bit.    The book is split into three main sections.  First he lays out his \\"Origins,\\" by talking about his parents and his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia. He segues into his time of becoming a young man of color in the United States.       In the second part, he tells of his days as an activist/organizer in Chicago.  Working in one of the worst neighborhoods, Obama tries to accomplish little victories by gaining enough grass roots support from neighborhood residents for things like employment centers and increased policing.      In the final act, he visits Kenya to meet his African family and learn more about his Father and his Grandfather, and he finds, not to his or our surpise, that the stories are complicated and not always flattering. Polygamy, violence, debt, political uprisings and betrayals are all part of the fabric of his heritage.       The story could get there quicker, and, at key points, Obama would rather detach and look at a painful or heart wrenching event with a somewhat clinical or philosophical lens.   I agree with other reviewers here that it is the type of book that you CAN put down.  However, it does speak with with an authentic disaffected voice, one that you can hear a little  in Obama's second book The Audacity of Hope, which is far less personal and more political.
015206396X|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It is a very good freshman effort. Well written and well edited. I enjoy in-depth character development, and find it all too often missing in many books today.  Loose ends and contradictions drive me bonkers. So to find that there weren't any obvious loose ends in this book and the characters were wonderfully developed along the journey, not by tedious outside descriptions, but by their actions, choices and even their turn of phrase, made me a very happy reader. The action was well treated as well, and all of it kept me up reading more pages at night than I had started out intending to read.<br /><br />I respect the author's different views on relationships and marriage, so the only criticism I have is based on personal preference: I would have preferred that the love interests in the story would have taken the plunge and gotten married, rather than just had sex. It cheapened the story a bit to me. But that is my view of romance - to each their own.<br /><br />Congratulations Ms. Cashore.  I look forward to reading your next book as well. Take all the time you need to make it as wonderful as this one.

B0018AK9RA|5.0|What can you say about this band that hasn't been said before? They are the masters of metal. All in their late 50's (except Travis) and Tipton 60. Instead of doing what many bands do by staying with the formula that worked in the past, Priest breaks ground with this incredible masterpiece depicting the life and times of Nostradamus. Halford's voice is better than ever. Highlights of the album are 'Prophecy', 'Revelations', 'Death', 'Exiled', 'Alone', and 'Nostradamus'. 'Nostradamus' the song reminds me a little of Painkiller and worthy of being a Priest classic. Perhaps for the fan stuck in 'Hell Bent for Leather' or 'British Steel' there won't be much appreciation. However if you open your mind and just take in the album for what it is I think you will find it's Priest at their best and most daring.
B001736FDK|5.0|Like some other series, Bartimaeus is not simply for the younger generation. A wonderful and addictive read, I found many sleep deprived nights to be a symptom.  Not of the horror within the book, but because I couldn't put it down!  I had to read just one more chapter; and then another, and so on.    I'll put it this way: I bought all three books less than a month ago.  I'm finishing up the last book, as I write this.  As much as I need more sleep than I've been allowing myself, I wish there were more to come!    Highly recommend to anyone from 10 years old, to a few decades, too!
B000002LSV|4.0|Okay, I confess, I am not much of a fan of the ZZ Top of the '80s-MTV era. They are a great band, no doubt, but since I am not a huge fan of the MTV years of ZZ, I had trouble really getting into 1992's 'Greatest Hits.'     Any fan looking to seek out their '80s MTV classics will be very satisfied with this disc. 'Sharp Dressed Man,' 'Gimme All Your Lovin',' 'Rough Boy,' a remix of 'Legs' and 'Pearl Necklace' are all here.    Fans of the seventies ZZ Top will also discover 'Cheap Sunglasses,' 'La Grange,' 'Tush' and 'I'm Bad I'm Nationwide' are all on here.     But don't fooled! 'La Grange' and 'Tush' are mediocre remixes. The original drum mix is completely destroyed, with Frank Beard reworking and filtering the drum parts to make these '70s ZZ Top classics sound more \\"modernized.\\" Argh! How annoying!    Also, the new tracks (for a '70s ZZ Top fan, anyway) aren't anything to get really excited about. ZZ Top's take on 'Viva Las Vegas' is not great. 'Gun Love' is better than 'Viva Las Vegas,' but it is still not anything extraordinary.    I am not criticizing the selections on this disc. For fans of the MTV years of ZZ Top, this is a great collection to own and quite possibly all you will need.     But, if you are like me and want a summary of their '70s classics, pick up 'The Best of ZZ Top.' That has 'La Grange' and 'Tush' in their album versions without the reworked/filtered drums.    Overall, I strongly recommend this to any '80s ZZ Top fan. But, I also strongly recommend for the '70s ZZ Top fans to check out 'The Best of ZZ Top.' While this has 18 and that one has 10, that one is full of the \\"good stuff\\" for the '70s fans.    Highly recommended for the '80s ZZ Top fans. I did buy this, and I was disappointed. But for the '70s fans, I'm warning you: pick up the studio albums or the 1977 compilation 'The Best of ZZ Top.' That's the best advice I can offer you.

B00003CXB7|3.0|For its time, this was an entertaining comedy with an anti-war message that was loved for its ability to express the feelings of most Americans at the time on the Vietnam War.  This is a film about the Korean War only in name but as you will see throughout, the de facto Vietnam theme is prevalent throughout sometimes subtly but even blatantly for instance in the downtown \\"Korea\\" scene where the women are all wearing Vietnamese-style conical hats which is not indigenous to Korea.<br /><br />Overall, this comedy doesn't age well for modern viewers although its anti-war message is very clear and resonates even today.  Some parts are simply boring and I especially found the whole football scene totally sleep-worthy and I didn't see how it added to the overall theme unless it's a way to show how Americans try to impose their culture on Asians with a sport that even today is struggling to find acceptance outside the U.S. and certainly within Asia.<br /><br />One scene that I found very powerful and which made this film at least watchable for me was the suicide scene.  The U.S. is this big superpower that everyone respects (Painless) and yet the truth is that it is insecure and needs to express its \\"manhood\\" to regain its potency and the way they decided to do this is to commit \\"suicide\\" by going to war and it takes his friends (allies) to show him the way and to stop him from going through with his plans.  In a way this movie's premise represent the allies and the Vietnam War/U.S. government is \\"Painless\\".  The Hotlips/Frank Burns humiliation scene is also powerful in that it exposes the hypocrisy of the U.S. government in trying to tell other nations how to live and govern themselves when it itself is inherently corrupt and filled with major problems of its own as is shown in another scene with Duke exhibiting his racist tendencies for example.<br /><br />Otherwise, the film is rather disjointed and comes across as a collection of anti-war skits that doesn't flow very well.  This dvd package is also disappointing as it unnecesarily puts into 2 discs what can be put onto one as the special features are not that long and the only reason I can think of why they would do this is to have the excuse to charge you more for the 2 discs.  The picture quality is slightly above VHS quality and there are still frames with white spots and other imperfections despite the heroic attempts at restoration of which they go through great pains to tell you on the second disc and in the accompanying booklet.<br /><br />The sound quality is okay coming in Dolby Digital THX mastered stereo although they really should have provided 5.1 surround options as well.  However, the documentary \\"Enlisted: The Story of MASH\\" is a gem as it relates the true life of a MASH unit in Korea and this accounts for one full star of my rating.  This movie is also important though as it started the highly successful and in my mind much better long-running television series where you get much better script writing and hence jokes than you get here.<br /><br />Still, this is an entertaining film that in a number of collected skits successfully shows us the futility and insanity of war.<br /><br />Updated on 6 June 2011:<br /><br />As Amazon will not allow me to review this separately, I'll have to append this here.  This blu-ray version of the film is certainly worth the double-dip as both the picture and sound qualities have improved vastly over the dvd version that I reviewed above.  While not pristine perfect the picture quality in 1080p looks a lot better than before and the sound in DTS HD MA 5.1 Surround is light years better than the dvd.

A runaway princess named Vespa (Daphne Zungia) is rescued by a stubbon but lovable space captain named Lonestarr (Bill Pullman) with his faithful half-man half-dog sidekick Barf (John Candy) with sassy robot Dot Matrix (Voiced by Joan Rivers) all join forces as Lonestarr must learn the ways of the Schwartz by wiseman Yogurt (Mel Brooks) then try to save Druidia.<br /><br />Excellent Sci-fi satire from parody mastermind Mel Brooks is one of the coolest and best movies he's ever done! i love how he makes fun of the Star Wars Trilogy, \\"Alien\\", \\"Planet of the Apes\\" and other popular sci-fi movies of the time. The film co-stars George Wyner as Colnel Sanders, Dick Van Patten as King Roland, Michael Winslow (\\"Police Academy\\"), Dom DeLuis as the voice of Pizza the Hut and even an appearence by John Hurt. This movie is a great 80's cult classic with the best laughs of it's decade thanks to the magic of Mel Brooks who always makes pure comedy gold.<br /><br />This DVD edition has excellent picture and sound quality with great extras like audio commentary, featurettes even a tribute to John Candy, still and photo galleries, Trailers, Film flubs, Spaceballs The Triva Game, Spacequotes and Storyboard-to-film comparisions.

0810994739|2.0|I borrowed this book from my public library and I was at first impressed with the little pictures and the layout of the book which really made it inviting to read. However, on reading it, I don't think there is anything really interesting about this book. It's not even that funny to me. I did read the whole book though. I have a better recommendation. Try « The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole » by Sue Townsend. There is about three in the series and while the first one was written in the 1980s and makes references to UK society and culture, it is a much more sophisticated read and a lot more funny, sad, etc. The Adrian Mole diaries begins when Adrian is 13 and 3/4 years old so a little bit older than Greg but not much more.    Two-star rating overall. Could be a lot more interesting.

0802130208|3.0|Having been smitten by this book in my twenties, I figured it was time to re-visit it in my forties.  Big mistake.  While still a ridiculous tragi-comedy, it must have been a slow year in 1981 for Pulitzer Prize contenders.  Maybe I just know too many people with Ignatius Reilly tendencies now. Perhaps the book's editors couldn't bring themselves to tighten up the work of a dead author. Anyway I cut it, I found it tiresome on second reading (though I will admit to laughing out loud repeatedly).
B00000JRTX|4.0|Highly regarded as one of the finest British comedies of all time, `Four Weddings and a Funeral' started off rather harsh (with perhaps 20 F-Bombs before another word was even spoken) and ended on the other side of sweet (awwww, they're kissing in the rain).  In the end, `Four Weddings...' works rather nicely, and while it's not the best British comedy in my opinion (I prefer screenwriter Richard Curtis' very own `Love Actually'), it is very enjoyable and worthy of most the love and accolades it has received.<br /><br />The film revolves around a group of friends who discover love, friendship and life over the course of four weddings and a funeral (or should I say, `three weddings, a funeral and half a wedding' to be more precise).  At the center of this group is Charles, a bachelor who is afraid of commitment.  His commitment phobia seems to fade away when he meets the mysteriously elusive American, Carrie, at a wedding.  They have a moment and then she is gone and he can't stop thinking about her.  The remainder of the film follows Charles as he tries to reconnect with Carrie, obstacle after obstacle falling into his path.<br /><br />I've read another review recently that mentioned how Andie MacDowell was perfectly cast as Carrie for the very fact that she is a boring actress, and her lack of natural charm made Charles interest in her all the more interesting.  I can agree.  I have never found MacDowell to be a particularly intriguing actress, that is for sure, but here she draws me in, mostly because I find myself trying to see what Charles sees in her.<br /><br />The film is littered with wonderfully full performances, especially by Hugh Grant and Kristen Scott Thomas, but no one can really be singled out as `worst-in-show' since everyone involved rises to the occasion and hands the audience a wonderful experience.  Grant though, should be singled out as `best-in-show' for he really personifies what he has been trying to personify since he first appeared on the big screen.  Some actors are always given a hard time for constantly playing variations of the same character.  Some do so wonderfully, others not so wonderfully.  Grant has made a career of, rather wonderfully, playing the commitment phoebe that unintentionally pushes everyone away with his arrogance.  Charles is the perfect example of this character because Grant has softened him to the point where his arrogance is an understatement and his gentle nature is his major selling point.  I am still baffled at the fact that Grant has yet to receive an Academy Award nomination, for he is constantly effortless in his roles and typically stands out in every film he inhabits as `best-in-show'.  Kristen Scott Thomas is also edible as Fiona, capturing the comedy within the script effortlessly, and inhabiting her character with real warmth and genuine heart.  Her secret desires for Charles help create a three dimensional character who is both easy to love and easy to understand.<br /><br />It must be said that Richard Curtis knows how to pen a winning comedy.  His style of wit and poignancy help elevate `Four Weddings and a Funeral' from a generic romantic comedy to something much deeper and ultimately much more memorable.  He has a knack for giving his characters something to sink their teeth into, something to really embellish and deliver to the audience.  He creates characters that we can feel connected to, and we truly feel connected to the ones presented us in `Four Weddings...'.<br /><br />In the end `Four Weddings and a Funeral' is a feel good romantic comedy that hits almost every mark and delivers a beautifully fulfilling cinematic experience.  It has its faults, sure, and it misses the mark in some areas, but not every film is aimed at perfection.  What every film is aimed at though is entertainment, and `Four Weddings and a Funeral' definitely entertains.are always given a hard time for constantly playing variations of the same character.

At the end, I realized I really liked it but didn't love it. Why ? Because some of the parts I feel were really long and she could have cut the in half. It was also a little cheesier than I was expected but none the less, it was worth reading it and I definitely recommend to everyone who is a fan to read it! I'm sure they will like it as well. It makes a good conclusion for the saga.

I have to say that I couldn't put it down and it was well written, just not too inspiring for me.

B000P0J0EW|5.0|Every time I watch `The Shawshank Redemption' my first thought upon its closing is `how in the world did this lose the Best Picture Oscar to `Forrest Gump'?'.  In all honesty there really is no comparison when you look at the two films.  One is a generic feel good film wrapped in saccharine clich&eacute;s and the other, this one, is a magnificent character study that slowly yet poignantly captures the very essence of life.<br /><br />No comparison.<br /><br />`The Shawshank Redemption' begins with banker Andy Dufresne being wrongfully accused of murdering his wife and her lover.  He is sentenced to two life sentences (due to his cold demeanor) to be served at Shawshank correctional institution.  He is immediately pegged as a weakling, not build for survival within the prison walls, but Andy soon turns heads as he proves those presumptions false.  Not only is he built for survival, but his presence ultimately helps the other inmates survive as well.  The film focuses on Andy and fellow inmate Red as they build a friendship that will last them forever, each of them learning from and teaching each other about life and what you make of it.  Red has been in prison a time now and has a lot to teach Andy about life within the prison walls, but in the end it is Andy's lessons of hope that bring a new light to Red's eyes.<br /><br />When watching `The Shawshank Redemption' I am constantly in awe at its power.  There is not a single aspect of this film that feels off kilter or missing; in fact I cannot think of a single flaw to write about.  It's hard when a film is this astonishing, for how can you really critique it, and no one wants to read redundant praising that lasts paragraph after paragraph.<br /><br />I will praise it though, and hopefully these praises don't find themselves repetitious.<br /><br />The first major selling point to this film is the script, which beautifully captures the genuine emotional state of the men involved.  You have the fear and hopelessness that corrupts the minds of the newly incarcerated, as well as the comfortable contentment that glosses over those fears as you adjust to life on the inside.  You have the greed and selfishness that infiltrates the eyes of those with power, and the disgust and resentment that permeates the air.  What I think is brought out to perfection is the displacement that shatters the lives of those `lifers' who find themselves out on parole, living amidst the rest of the world and unable to adjust to this freedom that feels to foreign to them.  Every single emotion bubbles to the surface and captivates the audience.<br /><br />Seriously people; `Forrest Gump'?<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, this film is superb.  The camera angles and close framed cinematography is stunning and helps capture each of the emotions the script so wonderfully fleshes out.  You audience can feel the restraint and claustrophobia that the characters feel emotionally, expounding upon the already deeply rooted emotional resonance.  The score, the lighting, the mood, the direction; everything helps elevate the film and create a magnificent cinematic experience.<br /><br />And then, there is the acting.<br /><br />Much praise has been given to Morgan Freeman for his powerful and moving portrayal of Red, but one cannot single out Freeman without mentioning Tim Robbins who serves as the emotional and moral clutch of the whole film.  Without his riveting performance the film would have failed to amount to all that it has become.  As Andy, Robbins brilliantly sifts through his emotional response to his surroundings, capturing his misery but never losing his hope, even when all feels lost.  Freeman is the perfect compliment to Robbins, cycling though Red's loyalty and admiration as well as his experienced emotional callousness.  They are the perfect pair and in all honestly should have BOTH been nominated at the Academy Awards.<br /><br />The long list of supporting players is also exceptional, from Clancy Brown's diabolical Captain Hadley to the slew of inmates that inhabit Shawshank.  William Sadler is memorable as Heywood, and James Whitmore is devastatingly real as Brooks.  His sub-plot regarding his release is one of the most resounding moments in the film.  Gil Bellows has a nice turn as Tommy, a young spunky rookie who makes an impact on the lives of Andy and Red; but when we are speaking of supporting players the one that stands out the most is none other than Bob Gunton.  His portrayal of the sinister Warden Norton is flawless.  He creeps up on you slowly, tearing at your nerves, and when he finally comes out and nails Andy with the bluntest of threats you are utterly blown away.<br /><br />In the end I am ashamed that the Academy went for generic and happy over meaningful and moving.  `The Shawshank Redemption' is not only the greatest film of 1994, but it is possibly one of the greatest films ever made.  There is so much to be learned about ourselves and others, so much which is lurking within every crevasse of Shawshank that we cannot just see this film once but are forced to witness its power over and over again.<br /><br />In the end `The Shawshank Redemption' is about just that; redemption.  One is uplifted upon the closing frames, the fact that hope prevails further cemented into their souls.  `The Shawshank Redemption' is the perfect example of a perfectly balanced film, one that slowly yet masterfully weaves a tail of humanity, starting with emotional death and ending with an abundance of life.ncy Brown's diabolical Captain Hadley to the slew of inmates that inhabit Shawshank.

184195392X|5.0|I tore through all 330 pages in just a few days. I was fascinated by the story. It was refreshing to read soemthing so different; I couldn't put it down.    Martel really did a fabulous job with this book. He gives the reader vivid imagery without being wordy. He keeps things entertaining throughout!    This book was a little outside my traditional reading genre, but I absolutely loved it.
B00004S35Z|5.0|\\"Fulfillingness' First Finale\\" does not get the recognition it deserved. While \\"Innervisions\\" and \\"Songs In The Key of Life\\" were both brilliant 5-star worthy masterpieces, neither of them come close to the beauty that is \\"Fulfillingness' First Finale.\\"    Of all the records Motown put out during its existence, none have the amount of soul that is found in this album. The songs range from moody and melancholy to cheerful and uplifting, although the tempo is relatively slow and soothing through the whole album.    \\"Smile Please,\\" the album's first song, sets the tone for the whole album, and is one of the best openers of Wonder's career. The keyboarding and vocals are slow and smooth, with moody but uplifting lyrics. The song is a definite gem. And this is only the first song.    From the soft and gentle guitar riffs of \\"Heaven is 10 Zillion Light Years Away\\" to the spacey \\"Too Shy To Say,\\"  Wonder does not fail to entertain and inspire. \\"Creepin',\\" one of the most heart-wrenching songs about love (yet still an unfathomably beautiful song) is also one of the greatest existing smooth R&B songs (and was covered by Luther Vandross for that reason.)    \\"Boogie on Reggae Woman\\" is one of the more upbeat songs while still capturing the mood of the album, and is an enjoyable song. \\"You Haven't Done Nothin'\\" is a great example of funk music. Both stand out, but fit in with the flow of the album.    The album closes with \\"Bird of Beauty,\\" a psychedelic-soul song, and \\"Please Don't Go,\\" a simple, upbeat song which closes the album just as beautifully as \\"Smile Please\\" opens it.    Stevie Wonder's emotions passionately flow through each song, whether it be from his voice or his instruments. The album is absolutely flawless, from the vocals to the instrumental segments. While it is the least accessible of his albums, if you buy this album, you will not be disappointed in the least. If you are any bit interested, get this album - it is a must own.
031606792X|5.0|From the moment my book arrived I couldn't put it down.  In a little over two weeks I've read and re-read it 4 times.  Can't wait for book #5.
1567184855|5.0|The most comforting message from this remarkable book may be its convincing evidence that we are not alone. First published in 1994 and now with the astonishingly small number of 300,000 copies sold, Journey of Souls probes the previous lives of 29 people who underwent regression hypnotherapy by Michael Newton, PhD, a certified master hypnotherapist.  These disclosures riveted my attention, because 15 years ago I was transported in a near-death asthmatic crisis to the edge of the realm Newton and his 29 subjects describe. See The Soul Factory on [...], for a description of what two churchmen have since told me was probably a \\"revelation.\\"  That experience showed me, in fragments, what Newton has skillfully sewn together in Journey of Souls: Case Studies of Life Between Lives -- proof that we are not alone in the universe, that we all have souls, that we return again and again to chaotic Earth and to other worlds in an infinite scheme of evolving Creation, the elusive purpose of which is to build perfection. Even plants and animals have souls in this common, eternal quest, Newton reports -- albeit souls of a less-developed nature than ours.  This work is not anti-Christian or anti-religion. Indeed, it reinforces most of the main themes found in the main religions. But it does depart sharply from beliefs many live with, such as the coming of a Day of Judgment, and Eternal Hellfire and Damnation as punishment.  These are not true, Newton tells us. In the evolving eternity of time and space, our souls grow and develop, and are not judged or damned. Most of the Bible should not be read literally as a truthful record of actual events, but as a profoundly meaningful collection of moral, ethical and spiritual messages wrapped in stories or parables as their vehicles.  For an excellent, short, lay-language overview of Newton's discoveries and a portal to diverse other sites and experiences in the timeless realm of souls he discovered, visit [...]. It could take you a lifetime to explore everything that has been experienced and retold about this subject; indeed, it took Newton 10 years to produce his book.  Which leads me to an intriguing question: Why have only 300,000 copies been sold in five editions since 1994?  One answer may be Newton's choice of publisher -- Woodbury, Minnesota-based Llewellyn Publications, which its Website [...] reveals to be heavily invested in works about witchcraft, astrology, tarot, paganism, the paranormal and the like.  Mainstream publishers, fed on celebrity and \\"how-to\\" blockbuster titles, may have found Journey of Souls an unlikely candidate for mass appeal, thus pushing Newton into a smaller but friendlier, alternative publishing niche.  Another answer may be that not many people are open to \\"new\\" ideas, however well authenticated, to the question: \\"What happens to us when we die?\\" Since infancy, most have been satisfied with the comforting answers parents for centuries have given: \\"you go to Heaven to live with Jesus forever\\" -- an answer that every church reinforces in greater and lesser measure throughout our lives. It's repeated in every religious funeral service.  Newton's book doesn't debunk this idea, either -- rather, it gives a much more \\"scientific\\" and to me, believable version of it.  Since the first Sputnik and views of distant heavenly bodies and galaxies began appearing in every child's schoolbooks, the idea of Heaven as a place in the clouds populated by white-robed angels behind the Pearly Gates has long been unbelievable to modern minds.  And from that simple disillusionment to its grimmer next step -- that God is not seated on a throne there with Jesus at his right hand and the Holy Ghost at his left -- may seem a quantum leap to many.   So we shrink from it. This is something we don't spend a lot of time wondering about as we go about our daily lives and habits, including the rituals and liturgy of church on Sundays.  \\"Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy Kingdom come ...\\" We believe this prayer, even as we know the greater reality that there is no Heaven and no Kingdom -- at least, not above the clouds or anywhere else our telescopes can see. Jesus gave us the Lord's Prayer before there were any telescopes.  Although speculation persists, some Bible scholars even insisting they have found heaven physically located within our Solar System ([...]), the modern church does not teach us where Heaven and the Kingdom of God are located. Instead, it invites us to imagine them in a spiritual context, open to a vast array of future possibilities, including their joint establishment here on Planet Earth after Judgment Day -- to which I can only wonder: If we have to wait until then to see it, where is it now and where has it been since God, in the Book of Genesis, created Heaven and Earth?  These are difficult theological questions to which organized religion has no satisfactory answers. And since it has no satisfactory answers, most of us don't think about it. We either have faith in the unknowable, or we don't -- and increasingly large numbers of us don't.  That's where Newton's descriptions can fill a void, if you can be bothered looking for the answers to theological questions that you may have for so long given up asking in your faith. If you're like me, you have been \\"treading water\\" in this area for long time.  Michael Newton began his research as a self-admitted atheist. His research, he says, made him a believer in an infinitely evolving universal Creation and in its single Creator, who, he admits, might well be God.  Reading Journey of Souls reminded me not only of my own still-vivid encounter 15 years ago and the indelible impressions that left in me, but also of so many of the eternal themes of the Bible, and of the fundamental teaching of other religions.  The spirit world where souls eternally learn and strive to improve, revisiting Earth and joining new human lives in their quest as part of continuing Creation, is based on love, according to Newton and others whose own observations and experiences support his narratives. Vengeance, hatred, envy, greed, lust and other vices are -- like punishment and retribution -- all human deficiencies not found in the realm of souls that Newton and others describe.  Although Christianity and other religions do not directly address this, their positive teachings and the universal rules for living a good life in harmony with each other here on Earth, all broadly comport with what is found in the Journey of Souls.
0143038419|3.0|By all rites I should have adored this book. The premise is great, but I found the delivery lacked. In a way, I'm disappointed I bought this book because all I did was finance her travels. Maybe I can get my $ back and put it toward a fund to travel myself?    Besically, the book seemed a forced and the author seemed a little shallow and self-righteous. The great title attracted me to this book, but after reading it I got the feeling Ms. Gilbert may have come up with a great title and then tried to write a book around it.     All that said, it was a fairly interesting read (though it did stall at times). I really didn't dislike the book, it definitely deserves 3 stars, I'm just having trouble coming up with good things to say about it.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko is what happens when Stephen Hawking gets high and writes a film. This dark, surreal movie is brilliant if a little confusing. The director's cut is MUCH easier to digest, as all the cut scenes actually EXPLAIN what the hell is going on. If you enjoy the ideas of Theoretical Physics, hallucinations, and/or insanity you should check out Donnie Darko.
015206396X|5.0|[[ASIN:015206396X Graceling]] is the story of Katsa, a Middlun, and Po, a Lienid. The kingdoms of the Middluns and Lienids are only 2 of the 7 kingdoms where the story takes place.  Certain people (including children) of these kingdoms, are gifted with what they call Grace.  Each Grace is unique to the person who has them, and a child who is Graced will often show it from birth with different-colored eyes--i.e., one eye is a different color than the other.      Graces are varied and may range from the everyday such as cooking (people with this Grace are exceptionally good cooks), to the more extraordinary ones like the ability to see into the future (kings usually keep these people close by for obvious reasons).  Graces sometimes take time to manifest, but in the case of Katsa, it manifested really early, when she was about 8.  Unfortunately for Katsa, her Grace is lethal to anyone who she perceives is a danger, or who her uncle, the king of the Middluns, perceive should be disposed of.  Although Katsa uses her Grace mostly for good, she is a helpless tool in her uncle Randa's court until she defies him one day and leaves with Po, whom she met while on a secret mission, to help him find out the reason for Po's grandfather's kidnapping.  Their trip/adventure takes them through several places where they are sometimes in danger for their very lives, even though both of them are skillful fighters. They meet people along the way who are both ready to help and sometimes betray, hurt, or kill them.  They also meet someone who is running for her life whom they take it upon themselves to protect with their own.  They also find love and test the strength and fidelity of that love, even as they both walk almost to their doom.  In the end, however, Katsa saves them all with her Grace, and though there is a hint of sadness in how the way things turn out in the end, there is a very satisfying resolution to the original mystery set out in the beginning of the book.      I wish I could say more, but the book is such a wonderful read and so well written--newbie author, Kristin Cashore, is that good!--that I am holding myself back from telling the whole story.  It is a book you will find hard to put down until you get the answers to Katsa and Po's questions and the resolution of their mission.      One word of caution, though: the book is marked for readers ages 14 and up.  There is mature adult content that is not appropriate for 14-year-olds, simply because they are so broadly hinted at that they're already obvious.  I would push the minimum reader age for this book to 16 years old if only for this reason alone.
031606792X|5.0|I went into reading this series with the understanding that it is for entertainment value, which is what I got. Besides, if you have made it this far in the series, why would you stop? I think the story was enough to keep me rolling through the pages. I liked it. I think Stephanie's writing style has improved some through the years as well. I mean, as a newbie writer she seemed to mention the mundane actions a lot, and I understand that through most of the story there was a huge sense of internal character struggles so the action was to a bit of a minimum. However, I think in the 4th book she has a decent balance of internal commentary as well as the changing physical surroundings.    The story has some interesting twists and I enjoyed the dramatics.    If you read to enjoy and not to have fictional characters help influence your huge life choices-- such as when you should get married, have kids, stuff like that, then I think this is a nice purchase for you to make. Some of these reviews had me kind of shocked...
B0017MO10U|4.0|Another SG-1 mega-episode keeping with the SG-1 tradition. If you liked the TV show, this should also please you. It wasn't something that would do well at the movie theater, but for the price, it is a great night's entertainment. Enjoyable. Sad to see some of the actors in their last SG-1 role (General Hammond, for example), and nice to see some of the other actors from the privious episodes that we haven't seen for a LONG time. I recomend it.
031606792X|1.0|When I was reading this, I'll admit, I was thrilled I had finally gotten my hands on Breaking Dawn. I was like Bella, a teenager in love with Edward and Jacob (or as much as any fan of the series could be). But this book has undone everything the three before it had created. All the characterizations, the foreshadowing, plots, everything that should have happened did not--or if it did, was so mashed up that the story looked like it had just been scrawled on a page and then typed As-Is with no look-over from an editor.<br /><br />And how Meyer defends \\"imprinting\\" is just frustrating. *SPOILER* The idea that werewolves are now forever pedilphiles is just stomache-turning. I LOVED Jacob, I won't deny how I was a Jacob fangirl. But now, I want to cry when I think of him and his nasty fate.<br /><br />No more worshipping every sentence S.M. types. Anne Rice is STILL and will forever be known as the Queen of Vampires. Meyer's work compared to Rice's is fanfiction (not the good kind) --on crack. And in my opinion, she shared her drugs with her publisher.<br /><br />My word: The series ended with Eclipse. And if you want to save yourself money, the story ended with Twilight-----as it orignially had been intended.
0316018953|4.0|Harry Bosch is back on the homicide squad - and even though the call he goes out on seems like it might be more related to Organized Crime, he is loathe to give up his first fresh case in years.  Contradictions quickly arise - as they always do in these books - showing that the murder victim, who appears to have been the victim of a mob-type \\"hit\\" has no ties to organized crime - but he did have access to radioactive material from just about every hospital in the LA area.  The FBI show up - including Rachel Walling, one of Bosch's former lovers - and want a piece of the action - preferably the biggest piece.<br /><br />While Harry tries to solve the crime, being thwarted on almost every side, a deadly danger could be menacing LA.  Can he find the answer in time?<br /><br />Great story - lots of action and suspense.  A definite recommend.
B0000057C5|4.0|This cd has always been my favorite.  The seller had it processed and delivered faster than I expected.  Great work.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this mini series as well as the film making details following the segments.  The film was very carefully done to be true to the times and the facts.  It followed David McCollough's book accurately and avoided Hollywood temptations in film making.  The film, like the book, succeeeded in bringing alive the real history of the foundation of our country and the incredible coming togerther of brilliant, dedicated minds that made it happen.  It gives one a deep sense of pride and renewed motivation to protect the freedoms these fine 'real' people earned at great cost to themselves, for future generations.
B00000IFP6|5.0|This recording is probably the best deal you'll find of the Beethoven Nine Symphonies, and to boot, they are all done remarkably well. I personally love each one individually, and I think the tempi in all of them are the best. Most notable tempi are 3, 4, 5, and 8.     The first and second are quite chraming, and have the perfect Beethoven flavor in them. The third has an excellent speed, and is exciting! I have never heard a better recording of the 4th, and it is now one of my favorite symphonies. The 5th is bold, and quick. I enjoyed the added repeat in the 3rd movement---it makes the movement feel more complete (did anyone else catch this?). Six is perfect. Seven is big and bombastical, like it should be. Eight is cute! The ninth is powerful, though the choir and some of the soloists aren't as good as other recordings I've heard (the men have trouble on their high notes). For a better recording, try the Karajan/Berlin recording ([[ASIN:B000001GPY Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 / Karajan, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra]]).    All in all, this is one of the best compliations of the Nine Symphonies I've heard and HIGHLY recommend it! And for only $25? That's not even $3 a symphony!!
B000H7JCG4|4.0|I am so happy that this show is now out on DVD's. However I really wish they had gotten the copyright releases for the music. They don't play any of the actual songs that were playing during the show. This makes a few episodes a little less than perfect. Like the episode where Brandon goes out with the teenage mom and they play \\"Joey\\" by Concrete Blonde. Losing that sound just takes away from the episode. I'd like to see them re-released with the right music. There were some great songs on that show. Too bad we don't get to hear them.
031606792X|5.0|I thought this was a wonderful, inventive, and appropriate conclusion to the Twilight Saga.  Everything in the first 3 books led beautifully into this well-crafted composition.  I loved the entire series and will undoubtedly re-read them over and over again.  My one naggy complaint is the the very last line of Breaking Dawn was a little cheesy and cliche... just that one ending line... but that's being pretty picky.    A great read! You won't be disappointed!
B0013L2EDQ|3.0|This book gets 3 stars because it is, in fact, a very quick read.  Lots of action and fun at times.  However, there are far too many times where you find yourself saying \\"Puh-leaze!\\".  Giant killer squid?  Red crab swarms that hack through everything in their path, including human legs?  A plague that turns the diseased into ravenous cannibals?  (When did this become Night of the Living Dead?)  An elderly couple - one of whom has a prosthetic leg mind you - that's able to outsmart, and physically overtake, trained mercenaries?  And, it goes on and on and on like this.  I have no problem with the suspension of disbelief.  But, unless I'm wrong, this was not intended to be a fantasy novel; it's a thriller.  But, unfortunately one that leaves you saying to the author \\"You've got to be kidding!\\"
B0019FOC5E|5.0|EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!  Have seen the movie 3 times and the soundtrack is wonderful.  I play it almost everyday!  One of the best musical soundtracks in years. A must have if you have seen the movie or even if you haven't!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|A truly awesome performane.  I am SO sorry I missed going to the show.  She is the ultimate show woman!!!  So sorry she is not planning another tour!!!  An absolutely beautiful & awesome entertainer!    Teri  Centerville, MD
B0000CDL93|4.0|I haven't viewed this movie since it came out, but after tonight's viewing, it still holds up as an engrossing and entertaining experience. Some of it maybe fiction and some not, but as for Oswald being the lone assassin, I just don't believe it. When you hear Mr.X describe his theory, it comes eerily close to  what out current President has done with Iraq.<br />I gave this edition only 4 stars because they really didn't need to fluff this one up by 17 minutes, a reason why it was left on the cutting room floor for theatrical release is quite apparent.<br />But do watch and decide for yourself...it is up to you and every American to decide and debate amongst yourselves.
B00005JO5L|5.0|A Pachino movie thats not talked about to often. Disturbing and dark with a twisted ending.....buy it!
1593082649|4.0|Northanger Abbey was Jane Austen's first novel, even though it wasn't published until after she died. While a delightful story, it doesn't quite measure up to Austen's other works. Catherine Morland, 17 and completely innocent, is invited to spend a few weeks in Bath with some family friends. Bath, a vacation hotspot in 19th century England, is filled with fashions and eligible young men and women, as well as parents looking to make an agreeable match. Catherine has never left her small village and is accustomed to being surrrounded by people who love her, and so is vulnerable to the tricks and games played by Isabella Thorpe and her brother John. Isabella has formed an attachment to Catherine's older brother James, and John attempts a similar relationship with Catherine. But our dear Catherine has developed feelings for Mr. Tilney. While Mr. Tilney shows the sparkling wit that Mr. Darcy will later become known for, much of the book is told through the narrator's voice which is awkward at times. It wasn't my favorite of Austen's books, that would be Pride and Prejudice, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I have been listening to this cd now since 1996 when i was in High school and it brings me back every time/every song. This was an awesome cd and still is. people up&coming in the game study it and use it in their own way. you can hear pac in countless people. Pac's spirit will always be there. The remixed version of some of his songs don't do it justice but some are cool as a newer feeling. all in all this is the best rap cd for me. give it a try if your part of my generation if your young you probably will never understand pac's influence on people...
B000W1YYYA|2.0|It's cool that there are so many reviews (mine'll make 100) regarding this CD. Most are enthusiastic, and that's cool, too. But those recommending this work should be more up-front with themselves and others that what they love about the \\"raw emotion\\" et cetera is really in the vocals and lyrics. The music itself is substandard, and folks, I grew up as a punk guy (Dead Kennedies, et al) and musical proficiency is still NOT a priority for me.     Positive reviewers should realize that the negative reviewers are probably more \\"in tune\\" with the lack of hooks or other non-lyrical proficiency on this CD (with the exception of \\"Teclo\\"). Put another way, this CD is not \\"accessible\\" and it's probably why the enthusiasm level is so high amongst many reviewers. It's different, even from PJ Harvey's other works. So please continue to recommend it but try to put an \\"advisory\\" or give background on your musical preferences.     My take? The lyrics are very spiritual (PJ for or against God) so I'd listen to it in a car to think about it. But as background music, like now when I'm typing at a computer, I'd never play this CD.
0743290119|1.0|After 106 pages of dribble, I finally had to put this book down. I've never read a Lauren Weisberger book, and I don't think I will ever ready anything else by this author. This book is boring, unimaginative and totally pointless, and I usually enjoy a good \\"chick lit\\" book.     The story follows the adventures of the pursuit of sex in love from three self obsessed, one dimensional, annoying characters.  Each characters vows to change there lives in the course of a year:     Adriana - Beautiful and shallow Brazilian who loves sex and likes to say \\"querida\\" alot - vows to be married by the end of the book    Emmy - Pathetic in that she likes to be in relationships with men that use her - vows to have one night stands with a man from every continent, except Antarctica     Leigh - Slightly OCD and a full on beoch, she doesn't know how to appreciate a man who truly loves her - vows to... well, I'm not really sure what she vows, but I was hoping it would be to stop complaining and waving her hand around every other paragragh(did anyone else notice this? The author always had her swirling, twirling or waving her hand, esp. when they all went on vacation together. I was like seriously, stop waving your hand!\\").     I would have finished this book if the characters went a little deeper, but the above pretty much sums up the main characters throughout the first half of the book. Maybe they redeemed themselves in the end, but I couldn't bring myself to read another 172 pages to find out. If you think \\"The Hills\\" is modern day Shakespeare, then you will probably love this book. If you find the above cliche, this book should be avoided at all cost, if just for the waving of the hands in every freaking paragraph alone!
031606792X|2.0|I like the ending to plenty of series...unfortuantely this wasn't one of them.  I wish this series had ended with the third book.  Living with anticipation is better than being disappointed.  Having said that, if the way this was written is how she would have written Twilight, this series wouldn't have developed the following that it has.  I loved the first third of this book...loathed the second third and am pretty indifferent to the final bit.<br /><br />I didn't love how the book was split with perspectives. Bella wasn't as full of the good sense that I have always kind of respected her for.  Edward was kind of brought down to someone who is just begging and following Bella around.  okay, okay...he always kind of did this, but this book just felt pathetic.<br /><br />I cannot write too much without giving a lot away, but Jacob seemed to be kind of a lame duck, Edward was a push over, Bella is too perfect and the supposed climax of the book is, simply put, anticlimactic.<br /><br />I thought this book would be them having a marriage and dealing with immortality but apparently Meyer had other ideas.  The side stories and characters that take over the story seem like strangers.
B000000OQY|1.0|\\"Good boys don't make rock'n'roll. Bad boys do.\\"     Guys, this album can't even be called rock. It's just very bad quality smooth pop, that was SO unfortunate to put out \\"One in a Million\\" (which only makes it worse).    There a lot of GREAT rock albums out there. So, do yourself a favor and pass this record.
0061150142|5.0|Just another great book by Jodi Picoult.  Not just another boring romance novel...her books cover subjects no one else does.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I believe Iron Man is the best movie of all the comic book movies put out to date.  I know many people will disagree with me, but I believe it has a wider appeal than a Batman movie.  I've seen this several times in the movies and loved it.  Widescreen will be mandatory for watching.  Otherwise, great acting, interesting story, and it's fun (which is something you cannot say about Dark Knight).  It's great to see that Robert Downey Jr. got himself straightened out---he really makes the movie.
031606792X|5.0|This is a good book. It was a little strange to me to read the story but after it was all over and I had time to think about it, I fell in love with the story like I have in the first 3 books of the saga. Edward and Bella finally get their happily ever after.
031606792X|1.0|First, I admit that the first two books intrigued and startled me.  I read this series so that I knew what my teenage daughter was reading.  The last and final book - Breaking Dawn -- literally broke the series for me.  I was OK with the first three books, but the third, well, I believe all the other reviews have said it.  Breaking Dawn is pretty lame... For someone with as much talent as she has, I was disgusted.  The book focuses highly on Bella's need for sex and gratification.  Meyer creates a \\"perfect world\\" scenario, which is absolutely not real-world.  Yes, I realize this is Fiction and Fantasy.     Through her writing, Meyer has the potential to mold and encourage her readers, particularly the teen market.  Readers are/were wild about this stuff!  What an opportunity to show our failing youth that \\"yes, life is tough, but you can make good decisions\\" and \\"Yes, there are challenges, but life is never perfect and there is always suffering\\".  I was so very hopeful that the 4th book would wrap some of these kinds of ideas into a nice neat package where teens around the world could rally together in a common cause for good.  So much for that hope.  My teenage daughter will NOT be reading book # 4.  And my older daughter, well, she chose to skip to the end, rather than bore herself to tears.. Then she ranted as I did.. Stupid, stupid book!  I'll never read another Stephanie Meyer book in my life!

0307269752|5.0|A 24-year-old computer hacker sporting an assortment of tattoos and body piercings and afflicted with Asperger Syndrome or something of the like has been under state guardianship in her native Sweden since she was thirteen. She supports herself by doing deep background investigations for Dragan Armansky, who, in turn, worries the anorexic-looking Lisbeth Salander is \\"the perfect victim for anyone who wished her ill.\\" Salander may look fourteen and stubbornly shun social norms, but she possesses the inner strength of a determined survivor. She sees more than her word processor page in black and white and despises the users and abusers of this world. She won't hesitate to exact her own unique brand of retribution against small-potatoes bullies, sick predators, and corrupt magnates alike.<br /><br />Financial journalist Carl Mikael Blomkvist has just been convicted of libeling a financier and is facing a fine and three months in jail. Blomkvist, after a Salander-completed background check, is summoned to a meeting with semi-retired industrialist Henrik Vanger whose far-flung but shrinking corporate empire is wholly family owned. Vanger has brooded for 36 years about the fate of his great niece, Harriet. Blomkvist is expected to live for a year on the island where many Vanger family members still reside and where Harriet was last seen. Under the cover story that he is writing a family history, Blomkvist is to investigate which family member might have done away with the teenager.<br /><br />So, the stage is set. The reader easily guesses early that somehow Blomkvist and Salander will pool their talents to probe the Vanger mystery. However,Swede Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is no humdrum, formulaic whodunit. It is fascinating and very difficult to put down. Nor is it without some really suspenseful and chillingly ugly scenes....<br /><br />The issue most saturating The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is that of shocking sexual violence primarily against women but not excluding men. Salander and Blomkvist both confront prima facie evidence of such crimes. Larsson's other major constituent elements are corporate malfeasance that threatens complete collapse of stock markets and anarchistic distrust of officialdom to the point of endorsing (at least, almost) vigilantism. He also deals with racism as he spins a complex web from strands of real and imagined history concerning mid-twentieth century Vanger affiliations with Sweden's fascist groups.<br /><br />But Larsson's carefully calibrated tale is more than a grisly, cynical world view of his country and the modern world at large. At its core, it is an fascinating character study of a young woman who easily masters computer code but for whom human interaction is almost always more trouble than it is worth, of an investigative reporter who chooses a path of less resistance than Salander but whose humanity reaches out to many including her, and of peripheral characters -- such as Armansky -- who need more of their story told.<br /><br />Fortunately, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in English translation will be followed by two more in the Millennium series: The Girl Who Played with Fire, and The Air Castle that Blew Up. I can't wait. Larsson also made a 200-page start on a fourth book, but sadly he succumbed to a heart attack in 2004 and his father decided the unfinished work will remain unpublished.<br /><br /> I recommend this international bestseller to all who eagerly sift new books for challenging intellectual crime thrillers, who luxuriate in immersing themselves in the ambience of a compellingly created world and memorable characters, who soak up financial and investigative minutiae as well as computer hacking tidbits, and who want to share Larsson's crusade against violence and racism.uding men.

0316067601|5.0|this book is amazing!!  i couldn't put it down... i read it in just a few days.  bought one for my brother-in-law who is thinking about joining the military... he said it was the first book he's read cover-to-cover since high school.  i told my sister about it... she got back from iraq a year ago... she loved it!!  and my 12 year old son has started reading it too.  can't think of another book that i've wanted to share so badly!!  i always thought i was pretty informed about things but this book gave me an even greater appreciation for our special forces.  it is amazing what they have to go thru and i am thankful every day that we have such brave soldiers serving our counrty.  true heroes.
0061537934|5.0|Simply one of the best books I have ever read. Yes, I am a dog person so I guess I'm a bit biased. But what struck me about this book is how much Enzo (the dog who writes the book, through Garth Stein) has to teach humans about living and life. He told people that they should listen, not make everything their story--it struck me to let people tell their story not make it mine. I cannot imagine that everyone would not enjoy this book. Did I cry,yes,but they were not just tears of sadness but of joy, as well. The ending is uplifting, and the book shows the triumph of the spirit over adversity.
B00000425R|4.0|The re-master of a 1974 Decca Record recording is excellent in execution and style.  Neveille Marriner and St. Martin-in-the-Fields perform in their typical excellent manner.    However, the recording over emphasize the soloist.  I find this unfortunate, since the play between the opposing instruments is a little lost.    Still, an excellent recording.
B0017I1FNK|3.0|At least I can say it's not a bad album, but I'm not going so far to say it is a great disk either.  It's no 'Wrecking Ball' or 'Red Dirt Girl'.  Heck, it's not even a 'Cowgirl's Prayer'.<br /><br />It seems when it was released a few months back, every reviewer heaped nothing but praise on it. That's hard to live up to. And in my opinion, it doesn't.<br /><br />As expected, there is nothing wrong with Harris' voice - it is still crystalline and unique as always. And though it was recorded over a three year stretch with her ex-husband as producer, it still has decent flow and consistency. A little too much consistency, where to a point there seems to be little deviation in the song style.<br /><br />Maybe it's the material.  But whatever it is, it is just not firing on all cylinders for me.<br /><br />That's not to say it is bad - as I said earlier.  It's fine, but it doesn't have too many stand-outs and that is usually what I love about Emmylou - she has plenty of them.  But compared to anything else out there, it's a very good disk, but compared to some of her other works, it is just very middle of the road.<br /><br />As usual, I just purchased her without listening to it, as you usually get a quality disk.  Technically it is - I was just expecting so much more.

184195392X|3.0|While I enjoyed most of this book, I had trouble deciding exactly how to rate it. I loved the angles about the animals, the details of training and behavior, and the descriptions for everything from meercats to elephants. The character of Pi is one I won't soon forget: likable, heroic, and undeniably human. We also get to know the Bengal tiger, Richard Parker, on an intimate level. The plot is extraordinary yet believable, especially due to the knowledge Pi learned at his zookeeper father's knee.     Part three of the book is hilarious, hitting a whole other tone.     The only downside is that a few parts dragged and went into things that, while interesting, could have been summarized or left out. Like a lot of the stuff at the beginning of the story about his family and his religious views could have taken up fewer pages. The stuff about the three religions he belonged to definitely needs to stay in to explain his views on things, but the other stuff really didn't play into the main story. There were a few too many fishing stories.     On a side note, I think I actually learned a few survival skills by reading this novel.
6304698623|1.0|Don't waste your money on this mess.  Perhaps someday someone will make a version of 'A Little Princess' that's worthy of the name, but this isn't it.  The only resemblance between this production and Frances Hodgson Burnett's 'A Little Princess', aside from the title, is the fact that it has characters named Sara, Ram Das, and Miss Minchin, and the only reason this gets any star at all is because Amazon will not let me give it no stars.  All the artful camera work in the world cannot make this dreck into proper telling of 'A Little Princess'.  It hasn't the magic.<br /><br />What was Cuar&oacute;n thinking?  Did he even read the book?  If so, he didn't understand it.  No dead father?  No London setting?  No Cockney Beckey?  No money-grubbing, toading from Miss Minchin?  No fabulous clothes and furs at the front of the line?  No suffering prisoners in the Bastille and no fortuitous finding of the four-pence?  Wrong, wrong, wrong!<br /><br />Instead of mysterious diamond mines we are given crackers!  Seriously.  Crackers!  Instead Mr. Carrisford's dramatic recovery and Ram Das confessing how he created 'magic', we're given a tawdry police pursuit in the rain and a soap-opera amnesia plot point.  Instead of kind, wise, insightful, introspective and thoughtful Princess Sara, we have foisted on us a prank playing, spiteful retorting, 'curse' slinging pretender to the throne who would never care enough for the general populace to make arrangements to give bread (or even crackers) to the poor.<br /><br />And we have thrust down our throats repeatedly the mantra that, \\"every girl is a princess\\", apparently no matter how spiteful, unkind, or common her behavior.  Sarah's princess-like nature was supposed to be what set her apart from the common girls, no matter her material circumstances.  Talk about missing the point.

B000005ITX|5.0|As a teenager in the 60's, and a literal garage rocker, my bandmates and I latched on to Love.  When their first album came out we figured out all the music and lyrics, and would play them in my friend's room and record ourselves on his old reel to reel, trying to mimic the cool vocals of  Arthur Lee, Bryan Maclean and company in a fair attempt at matching the harmonies and chord changes which were, for the most part, remarkably simple. We even had down the design of  Love's red logo, drawing it all over the place.It was a great thing. Then Da Capo, their second album was released. Well, the difference between it and the first album was huge. The beautiful rudimental sound of their debut album had leapt to heretofore unknown territory and into a completely different musical realm, with it's sophisticated use of instruments foreign to us young rockers. I mean, the Harpischord! Well it was getting more difficult to reproduce  these songs, but we had fun trying, and man, we were on the edge digging it. Then Forever Changes, came out, and by now in my neighborhood, Love had caught on, and was on the stereo at all the parties. We had been on this early alternative wave from the beginning and did love Love. Now over 40 years later, this record has only gotten better with each listen, always with some nuance to a lyric or melody unheard previously. I listened to Sgt. Peppers today, and then to Forever Changes following, the former really sounding kinda silly and camp mostly (except for a few timeless tracks). But Love's third and best still awed me in its simply unrivaled achievement. Funny, I got my sister to listen to it last night for her first time in about 25 years, and she  could still sing the lyrics word for word, with all the changes still in memory. Yet it always is fresh and new as the title suggests.....
031606792X|1.0|I've spent the last few days struggling to get through this unwieldy tome, only able to read for short periods at a time before my mind clouded over from sheer boredom. I was looking forward to writing this review, but now that I've finished the book and the time has actually come, all I can feel is overwhelmed. There is just so much that is wrong. I'm almost tempted to keep my review to a couple of terse sentences. But I'll write the full version, too; if I can make it through 700-plus pages of literary torture, I'm sure I can write a half-decent review.<br /><br />First, the short version:<br /><br />Breaking Dawn is awful. Don't buy it.<br /><br />And now, the long version:<br /><br />*** SPOILERS AHEAD - READ AT YOUR OWN RISK ***<br /><br />First of all, it seems silly to be warning of spoilers for a book where nothing actually happens.  Someone needs to buy Stephenie Meyer a good book on writing that explains how to construct a plot... and a climax (more on that later).  But a few of some of my bigger complaints have little to do with the way the book was structured and written, and everything to do with the message behind the words.<br /><br />I'm pretty open-minded in my views, but I can not honestly condone any of the messages that Meyer puts forth in Breaking Dawn (and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the series). If I had teenage girls who wanted to read this, I would make a concerted effort to dissuade them. Meyer seems to have forgotten who her audience is. So what's so bad with the messages in the book? Where do I start?<br /><br />1. Bella gets herself pregnant. Despite the fact that she's only eighteen and that the fetus is killing her from the inside out, she stubbornly and selfishly insists on carrying the baby to term. She survives... but a real teenage girl with a high-risk pregnancy might not. Bella and the baby could have died, and she would have destroyed everyone who loved her. If she really believed she was going to be an immortal and live forever, the threat of eternal hell for having an abortion shouldn't have been an issue.<br /><br />As if the teenage pregnancy isn't bad enough, Bella also has the most unrealistic baby imaginable. I even caught myself thinking that maybe having a baby wouldn't be so hard. And that's what I find alarming. I'm a grown adult and the book influenced me (momentarily) that way. What are impulsive teenagers going to take from it? Bella's experience was not normal at all; she didn't have to deal with any of the negative aspects of babies. There were no diapers, no 2 AM feedings, no temper tantrums, no post-partum depression. Bella didn't even have to think about supporting the child because her husband is rich. How many real seventeen-year-old husbands can you say that about?<br /><br />And the way in which Bella was able to get pregnant doesn't even make sense. Vampires don't eat, don't go to the bathroom, don't sweat, don't grow hair... and yet they can somehow produce sperm from their stone testicles. Does Meyer need an anatomy textbook as well as a writing manual? (I'm all for fantasy, but it has to be plausible.)<br /><br />One final thought about the baby. Eighteen-year-old girls should not be allowed to name their children, because they come up with stupid names like \\"Renesmee\\". The kid's lucky she wasn't named after Edward's biological mother instead of his adoptive one. Then she would have been \\"Renizabeth\\". To be perfectly honest, though, I don't think that sounds any dumber.<br /><br />2. Too much is made of physical perfection. From what I can see, the only reason that Edward is attracted to Bella is because of her looks, because she's certainly not interesting. She has no hobbies (except sex), and she even turns her nose up at admission to a prestigious university. Eternity is going to get old very fast. But, apparently, Edward doesn't seem to mind because Meyer makes it seem like a guy who can speak half a dozen languages, write music, play the piano, and otherwise improve his mind is going to be satisfied with a dullard like Bella... just as long as he can gaze at her beauty for all eternity. Bella, for her part, seems to know what a dud she is; we hear about her low self-esteem endlessly. And yet, she gets the guy anyway. What kind of message does that send to young women? Physical beauty is all that matters? That's certainly what I took from it (thank goodness I'm old enough to know better).<br /><br />3. These vampires are the environment's worst nightmare.  If you're going to be around for centuries, casting aside clothes after one use, driving gas-guzzling sports cars, and taking down large game just to drain the blood... well, you're going to be using up a lot of resources. For creatures who are going to live forever, you'd think they would have a little more foresight. Or maybe I just wanted to see vampires driving a fleet of little electric cars.<br /><br />4. And speaking of cars, portraying Bella's child sitting on people's laps in cars is completely irresponsible. I don't care if she's invincible. It doesn't send a good message (Britney Spears, anyone?). Besides... if Bella ever got pulled over, wouldn't it be less conspicuous if her child was buckled in safely?<br /><br />There were plenty of other things I didn't like, either. Edward's assertion that humans smelled more like carnivores than herbivores was most likely wrong (unless Meyer is assuming that all humans eat as many animal products as Bella did. Honestly, food other than eggs or meat barely crossed her lips. I can't see why she'd smell that good to Edward. With a diet like that, she should have smelled like rotting meat).<br /><br />I hated the switch in point of view right in the middle of the book. The descriptions of the wolves patrolling the forest were extremely boring. It almost seemed like a day-by-day account, and nothing was really happening. The switch was also confusing. We're told in that section how other people see Bella.  But it's not consistent with what came before and it was as if we were seeing an entirely different character.<br /><br />Oh, and I can't forget the whole imprinting thing.  Why are all these adult wolves imprinting on toddlers? Talk about pedophilic. I don't care that they keep insisting that they have no control over it. There is one person who does have control over it, and that's the author. It would have been weird enough if it had just happened once. But twice? I couldn't get past the feeling that these were pedophiles who were grooming their little victims until they were old enough to actually do something with. For a while, I thought that Jacob might imprint on Leah (or at least on another grown-up). But that would have been inconvenient for Meyer.<br /><br />Convenience. That's what this book boils down to, and that's what ultimately makes it fail. Isn't it convenient that Bella (who has no other talents to speak of) possesses the talent that can save them all? Isn't it convenient that, when she finally becomes a vampire, she can restrain herself from killing humans? Isn't it convenient that the point of view shifted in the middle of the book to Jacob's point of view? Isn't it convenient that Alice showed up at the last minute with the one person who might give the Volturi pause? Ohh... don't even get me started on the Volturi.<br /><br />I alluded earlier to the fact that this book has a weak plot and climax. I'll correct that statement. It has NO CLIMAX. The Volturi showed up and, aside from barbequing an inconsequential secondary character with a fancy cigarette lighter (or whatever it was), nothing happened. Nothing. They talked their way out of the predicament and left. While that may be the ideal situation to conflict in real life, in literature it just makes for boring reading. The promise of the foreshadowing is shot, and the reader just ends up frustrated. The Volturi had so much potential as villains, and that potential was completely underutilized.  The high point of the story actually came much earlier, when Bella gave birth. By that time, though, I was so frustrated with endless descriptions of wolf patrols and Bella's martyrdom that I just wanted the baby to kill her and Edward to fail. That would have at least been interesting... and I could have saved myself the hours I spent reading the last half of the novel.<br /><br />In short, this was a book that appears to glorify teenage marriage and parenthood, encourage disrespect for the environment and resources, and condone pedophilic tendencies... all while nothing actually happens. Bella got everything without having to sacrifice anything, and everyone lived happily forever after. If you must read Breaking Dawn, get it from the library.

031606792X|2.0|Given that Stephenie Meyer has never been a stellar writer (the only redeeming quality of her books are the ideas and how engrossing the plot is), Breaking Dawn was a complete disappointment with regards to the first three books of the series.  Everything was too neat, too convenient.  Jacob's narration interrupted the narrative flow and the dialogue, for the most part, didn't seem believeable or very three dimensional.  I have to agree with the other reviewers that say Breaking Dawn reads like an elaborately written fanfiction.  The fact that sex was all Bella seemed concerned about was just horrible--it really seems to exemplify her dependence and addiction to Edward.  The whole \\"love\\" story between them doesn't come off as a healthy relationship.  All she cares about is having sex with him and he has no redeeming qualities to garner her \\"love.\\"  There was no character development or growth in Breaking Dawn.  Bella remains the same two dimensional character with dependence and self esteem issues.  Nothing in the book was realy very believable.
0743486285|4.0|Nikki Sixx touched upon his addiction in Motley Crue's The Dirt. But whereas much of that book comes across as chest thumping - and probably exaggerated - tales of rock star excess, Nikki's solo project, The Heroin Diaries, is just what the title describes. A very personal account of his trials and tribulations with sex, drugs, rock n roll, women, his bandmates, other bands, the media and most of the world for that matter. A great read that is near impossible to put down.
B000YABYLA|5.0|The thing I love about movies is that five people can walk out of a movie saying what it's \\"about.\\" Then they find that no two have said the same thing. So it didn't really surprise me when so many mainstream reviewers of this splendid movie were saying that it was \\"about teen pregnancy.\\"     Well, sure, in a way. There are certainly people writing reviews right here at Amazon pointing out fearfully that Juno is giving teens a message that pregnancy is merely a happy lark. However, as Juno (the movie) was finishing up, I didn't find myself thinking that  Juno (the girl's) situation was headed to Happy Town courtesy of a perky duet. The same 60 years that have taught me that a good song by itself won't get you far in the long run have also taught me that when it comes to guessing who survives tough situations, my money goes with the family that pulls together in a loving way when the crisis hits the fan.     Behind all the eye-rolling funny lines in Juno's family is their love for their kid. She's weird. They know it. She knows it. They go with it. So when things go seriously wrong for Juno, she can go home and tell them, trusting they won't dump her. They suck it up and deal. They are there when she really needs it, and, significantly, they don't make her pay for it. With that in mind, a lot of people who are angry at this movie might do well to watch it again.        To them I can only say that, despite the fact that teenagers often have a stunning way of ignoring information and advice which can help them, they can also be quick to notice how their lives differ from those of others. My guess is that most teenaged girls don't walk away from Juno marvelling, \\"Oh, getting pregnant looks totally cool! Like I SO have to try it!\\" More likely they are thinking, \\"Yeah, right! MY mom and dad would KILL me!\\"     Juno had real supports. Her girlfriend was wonderful in the way she was \\"there\\" for Juno. Many pregnant girls who are lucky enough to have such a supportive friendneed her to survive the anger and disappointment of their families. What a waste. No surprise that the girls have so little emotional energy left for significant details like, \\"What does it mean to have a baby anyway?\\" and \\"What am I going to do with it?\\"    It's no accident that both Lars and the Real Girl and Juno were so wildly popular with their audiences. Each movie offers its own original, appealingl version of a similar belief--that the support of kind, loving families, friends, and communities will make all the difference for people in need. It's a message which strikes me as being, these days in particular, well worth serious consideration--which is why I found Juno such a more substantial movie than just cute or quirky.

Bastianini is simple put a genius. Bergonzi also in great shape (for the record, I can't stand Corelli). As for Stella, prejudice apart, she is also outstanding. This is a very experienced cast and conductor (Serafin) and they deliver a very strong performance. I heard other high-rated Il Trovatores and this one is by far the best of all. At that time, DG used to record operas with closed-mikes with a lot of ambiance (Kubelik's Rigoletto, Karajan's Cavalleria Rusticana and I Pagliacci and so on). This recording follows the trend.

B0000041TD|5.0|When you compare Freni with the light roles that she used to sing in the 60s and this Freni, you will think they are two different singers. But what is truly amazed is the fact that not only her voice changed, but she became bar none to one of the hardest heavy lyric soprano roles ever: Mimi. And when she has Pavarotti next to her, it is like heaven. But, wait... Who is conducting is Karajan, unarguably one of the best puccinian ever. This is a record to listen, re-listen, re-listen, re-listen until I don't know when...

0618918248|5.0|It comes down to probabilities. Based upon the evidence Mr. Dawkins has reviewed, he has concluded that God doesn't exist. The book is his explanation as to why he came to his conclusions. The man is a scientist and has spent his life questioning the world around him. Blowing a blood vessel because Mr. Dawkins dares to address the issue of God's existence highlights a religious individual's insecurity about their own beliefs. Lighten up people. The book is fun, informative and worth reading just for the sake of understanding that atheism isn't some big bugaboo. Speaking as an agnostic, read it and judge for yourself. I enjoyed it very much.
0316067601|4.0|Marcus Luttrell would like you to know three things:    1. He reveres the men who fought with him and died next to him in Afghanistan and would like their story known and remembered.  2. He believes that the Rules of Engagement that apply to US soldiers don't reflect the realities of war and ultimately cost his friends their lives.  3. He does not approve of the people in government that he believes are responsible for those rules and would like to see them discredited and removed from power.    Those points could have been driven home quite effectively in this book.  Luttrell has an amazingly powerful story to tell and the narrative offers perfect opportunities to make each point in an unforgettable manner.  However, Luttrell lets his emotions convince him to make the points out of order.  I can't blame him; he's seen, heard and experienced too much and has come by his deep anguish and anger quite honestly.  He can't wait for the right opportunity to make point #3 and hammers it home in the first two chapters of the book, without context and without varnish.  The impact of the whole book is lessened by that decision.    Even an open-minded reader will be taken aback by Luttrell's attack on Liberals and the US military's Rules of Engagement without the benefit of knowing the source of his vitriolic anger.  I suspect he loses a lot of readers before he can tell the story that would explain it all so vividly.  That's too bad, because a lot of people would gain a new perspective on the points he's trying to make if they read about what he experienced in Afghanistan.      I really recommend that you read this book, pushing through the anger and pain-induced hatred and bigotry that is on display in the first couple of chapters.  By continuing, you will get to see the world through the eyes of someone who has seen things most of us never will and consequently sees the world from a different, but totally legitimate perspective.  A different editor might have served Luttrell and his literary mission better, but then again, maybe he was just a Navy SEAL who had decided on his course.  In that case, I don't think any editor would succeed in changing his mind.

031606792X|5.0|This book totally exceeded my expectations when I heard about all the slack it was getting. Breaking Dawn made the Twilight series come full circle.     I think the fact that Jacob imprinted on her and Edwards baby is proof that there was always a reason they were friends.  Bella somehow felt that things would work out when she was pregnant. Something about her baby connected with Jacob.  It makes total sense when you think about it. It was never going to be right for bella and jacob. It was always about Edward, and anyone who thought different was delusional. I knew from the first time they met that they would end up together. I didn't start reading the series until the last book came out though so I knew it was between jacob and edward.     I think the one problem I had with this book, is how everything ends up so perfectly for Bella. I was definitely jealous of her when the story ended and I'm still trying to get real.  I mean, she married Edward who loves her more than anything in the world, he's as wealthy as can be, he's gorgeous, amazingly strong, kind-hearted, etc. Not to mention they do it pretty much all night long now that they don't ever have to sleep. Now that she became a vampire too, she is gorgeous and has a baby that will live forever.  Pretty much, Bella has what any girl would dream of. To live forever with the man of your dreams (and to never get sick of him). I just really didn't like that there was absolutely nothing wrong for her at the very end.     Could you think of a better life than what she has? I guess I just wasn't expecting everything to turn out so perfect. Other than that, I hated to finish reading the book and tried to delay that. It was like candy just like the other 3!

B000FIUPA2|5.0|Just received a brand new copy today very inexpensively via an Amazon reseller and couldn't be happier - CD on one side for the car and office and DVD-Audio for the home theatre. The DVD-A side features playback in Advanced Surround and Advanced Stereo for those who own a DVD-A player. For those who don't (but should) you can still enjoy the album in DTS Surround, Dolby Digital Surround and Stereo. It comes in a nice cardboard slipcase that is contoured to match the specialized jewel case.    For those who have been searching for the long out-of-print DVD-Audio disc but don't want to pay an out-of-print price, this is the best of both worlds and the most bang for your buck.    If you're considering a DVD-A player, check out the DV-980H made by OPPO. It's highly regarded as one of the best (and most affordable) DVD-A/SACD players today. I own one and it's fantastic!

B0018M6J90|5.0|When I bought this movie, I didn't quite know what to expect.  MISS PETTIGREW is one of those movies that if it did come to the theaters in rural Alabama, I probably would not have gone to see it because the theaters are reserved for \\"blockbusters.\\"  A look at the box shows no comment from a critic that I have grown to know and respect, I was curious about how Amy Adams and Frances McDormand would interact, and I found a perfectly delightful movie.<br /><br />This is the type of movie that when one writes about it, it is difficult not to give away \\"spoilers,\\" but on the other side of the coin, it is fairly predictable in that you \\"know\\" in your heart where it should probably go, but you are somewhat surprised by two things that happen along the way:<br /><br />1)  The performances.  Wonderful!  There was an indication or two that Frances McDormand, as Miss Pettigrew, was fighting an urge within herself on just how much to show of an emotion, a difficulty that some actors, have when they are both competent on the stage and screen, but that could, also, be a problem that was more the director's fault. Of all of the performances, only Shirley Henderson playing Edythe Dubarry was quite annoying, which grated me; however, her character was supposed to be annoying, which given some of her previous roles, \\"Moaning Myrtle\\" in the Harry Potter movies, is perhaps a type-casting she should be concerned about receiving.<br /><br />2)  The characters.  The writing was so skillful that you knew the characters, the good and the bad, before you met them.  The \\"over-the-top\\" performance of Amy Adams as Delysia Lafosse (\\"Enchanted\\") and \\"low-keyed\\" performance of Ms. McDormand were as balanced as the Ying and Yang symbols on an Asian scarf, designed by Joe Blumfield, nonetheless.  Seldom do you see a movie where the characters \\"fit\\" the acting, or is that vise-versa and the acting \\"fit\\" the characters.  Whatever the case, the characters are well developed.<br /><br />So, why 5-Stars?  I mean is this \\"Casablanca,\\" one of the few movies that I have ever given a 5-Star rating?  No, but MISS PETTIGREW is one of those movies that is fun, enjoyable to watch over-and-over for \\"things\\" one missed the first time, and at the same time, it provides several life lessons.  I would probably have given this a 4.5-Stars, but there is no such animal, at least here, and giving it 5-Stars, maybe, just maybe, someone out there, who really likes movies, and really enjoys very good performances will see the \\"5-Stars\\" and take a chance and have a nice one hour and thirty-two minutes watching this delightful movie.one of the few movies that I have ever given a 5-Star rating?

B001AQO3WY|2.0|I was a bit disappointed with this series.  Yes, the locations were great, South Africa is a dead ringer for Iraq, and the special effects were brilliant...BUT, I felt that there wasn't enough action.  Very few battle sequences, and those that there were, were too short.  The series spent way too much time with the internal politics of the military chain of command and how individual soldiers dealt with it.  I realize that the series was based on the writings and henceforth the book of the embedded Rolling Stone reporter that was featured in the series, but I must say that the fictional FX series \\"Over There\\" was much more exciting.<br /><br />That said, the portrayal of the first few weeks of the Iraq invasion was great.  From the MOP levels and the chaos in Baghdad after liberation was great.  So with that I give the series two stars, one for the location shooting, and one for the special effects.  I'd love to it it more stars, but quite frankly I would closely watch the show just waiting for something to happen, and then nothing ever did.<br /><br />If HBO, or whoever wanted to make a much more exciting show about the invasion, they should have used 3rd I.D. stuff, instead of a Marine Force Recon unit that *sighe* never got to do any force recon, other than once during the Nasiriyah sequence.

B00127RAJY|3.0|Let me start by saying, I love Jillian on \\"The Biggest Loser\\". She obviously has a big heart and wants to see people succeed and she knows how to work the fat off. For that reason, I was really eager to start this workout. Being a very regular exerciser at my gym for years (5-6 days per week), but still needing to lose weight and growing tired of the old gym routine, I thought I would try this at home. I knew this workout would be hard, but I thought it would also be good for me. It's a \\"boot camp\\" style workout and will definitely make you sweat, but if you have bad knees then beware! (I have progressive arthritis in both knees after years of dance, skiing, and being generally very physically active.) I don't recommend this workout for you. The workout involves a lot of jumping (jumping jacks, jumping rope motions, jumping kick-backs, etc.) alternating with squat-like movements. After doing the beginner workout one time, my knees are shot and I've been put on a \\"no exercise for minimum of 10 days\\" order. So far it's been 8 days and I'm still far from recovered.  What a bummer!  I have no doubt this is an excellent workout for someone with healthy knees and I'm passing the DVD on to a younger friend who I think will love it.  But if you have knee issues, you may want to look elsewhere -- or at least don't do the jumping (but that's a huge chunk of the workout so what's the point?). My jumping days are, unfortunately, over. Still looking for that challenging workout that will not stop me from walking. If anyone has suggestions, please pass them on in the comments!

It has more behind the scenes look and the script which was absent in the AOBB. My complaints for this book: Not enough coverage on the designs on Two Face, which I wouldn't mind seeing more of. The part where they discuss the making of the Joker is good, but we've seen many of his in pre-release promo materials, so not much surprise there. Overall, I still find this book a good addition to Batman movies fans everywhere.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|Finally!    Having grown up reading the comic from the Frank Miller era it would be fair to say I was a fan long before the film arrived. Having seen the studio release when it first came out I enjoyed the film but certainly felt it was missing something. That something that was missing has been judiciously amended in the Directors Cut of which this review comprises.    The Directors Cut proves yet again that studio's don't know as much as they think they know about the movie going audience. The decision to cut important character development, sub plot and themes which serve to enhance and underpin the Daredevil story merely reveals this flawed 'think tank in a bubble' aspect of the industry. What is put back into the film is a crucial 30 minutes of footage that was initially deemed superfluous to the action - not by the director it must be said but rather the studio heads.    The difference between Daredevil the Studio release to the Directors Cut is glaring and in the case of the latter what we are presented with is a Marvel superhero film of great depth and action combined. This is the way intelligent audiences always want their Marvel films - the studio's seem to miss this at times and assume we all just want action without storyline or character development ... how wrong they are!    A great deal of what initially fell to the cutting room floor was the story of Matt Murdock's ( Daredevil by day ) legal business partner Foggy played by Jon Favreau. It would have been criminal for this footage to never see the light of day as Jon Favreau brings a much needed light and contrast to the darker aspects of the films mood which also serves as exposition for what passes for Matt Murdock's normal day to day life as a lawyer. Through Matt's exchanges with Foggy we are also able to witness a more three dimensional and human side to Daredevil. Without Foggy we'd have a 2D superhero that not even the comics presented but which the studio's saw fit to provide us with in theirchosen release! Are you listening film makers?     The treatment of Daredevil overall is pretty well spot on as we get to see his origins as a young boy growing up in New Yorks Hell's Kitchen, the son of a working class single parent who is a boxer down on his luck.   There are plenty of clever nods to the Comic reading audience with the various names of fighters being the names of artists in Marvel who worked on Daredevil over the years. We get a nice cameos from Stan 'the man'Lee and one other absolute classic appearance from a Daredevil artist later in the film in a scene with Ben Urich, played by the great Joe Pantolano.    Ben Afleck does a great job playing Matt Murdock as does the stunning Jennifer Garner who plays what must be the ultimate film version of Elektra. Both of them put a great deal of work into training martial arts with the likes of Jeff Imada ( Bourne Identity ) and Wu Ping ( Crouching Tiger et al ) but I did feel the fight scene with Murdock and Elektra in the school playground was the weakest of the fight scenes in the entire film ... frankly it looked very stiff and not particularly fluid as it should have been. In the 2 disc version of the Directors Cut that I have we see the Chinese wire crew performing the fight scenes as they worked them out in Hong Kong using only handycams. What we see in these rough cuts is the difference between Martial Artists/Athletes and actors! Having said all this the rest of the fight scenes in the film were excellent and very well choreographed and performed.    Michael Clark Duncan is superbly well chosen to be the giant mob boss King Pin and the director was absolutely correct in ignoring skin colour and instead making sure that the spirit of King Pin was served through the right man playing the role ... he does indeed bring the gargantuan quality to King Pin to the big screen.    Colin Farrell as Bullseye is actually very good indeed and as he says himself, he 'camps it up' as that is exactly what we wouldexpect from a complete psychopath like Bullseye. Having Farrell play himself as Irish was the best move yet and he brings something very nasty to the role even though his character is so over the top. When we finally get to the crucial Frank Miller scene with Elektra and Bullseye it really is quite gut wrenching and Farrell delivers a kiss of death that saw the film elevated to an R rating based on this act alone! Not that I felt an R rating for this scene was justified but I agree that for younger audiences it is quite a powerful scene and can see why they may have given it an R.    Jenifer Garner as I said earlier is absolutely stunning as Elektra and is certainly not just a pretty face. She brings a visceral quality to Elektra that certainly brings her to life in way Daredevil fans could have only hoped for - her weapons work in the film is very well done and is to be commended.    All in all Daredevil the Directors Cut builds beautifully as it was supposed to have done and runs in at 128 mins which for me was not overly long at all. I will say it again, an audience would happily sit through an extra 30 minutes of footage that brings essential character development to a film and adds depth to the storyline. Rather than sit through a dissatisfying action film which runs in 30 minutes shorter and makes little sense of the overall theme it should serve as testimony to the fact that this kind of thinking from studios is a false economy.    We can have our popcorn and eat it too ... the Directors Cut gives you exactly that!
B000K7VHQE|2.0|Wow, was this ever a lame movie! It's unbelievable to me that so many people liked it! How is it possible that so many people had a VW bus AND are willing to love a movie on the basis of the vehicle alone? In all honesty, the funniest part of the movie was when they got to CA and the door fell off of the van (and that only got maybe half of a smile).    Perhaps my family wasn't quite disfunctional enough for me to find this terribly amusing, because BOY, it sure wasn't!
B000PC1N54|5.0|As a fan of tenor, Roberto Alagna, and having some knowledge of \\"hypogylcemia\\"( with which he was apparently struggling), I was interested in this production.  Roberto is extraordinry in the lyric repertoire.  This was a venture into new territory. The lyric repertoire serves his voice more ideally than \\"Celeste Aida\\" but the remainder of the opera was a beautiful and nuanced performance, with a very moving tomb scene. I remain a fan of his and appreciate the whole cast and performance.  We have a world of \\"armchair\\" critics and singing  connoseurs with an inability to factor in our vulnerable human condition and the vicisitudes of life.  This is most especially true where the singer's instrument is his body, which applies here.  We demand a lot of these artists wih their jet-setting schedules, and yet are quick to spit out disparaging remarks and \\"boos\\".

I purposely ordered the EXPLICIT version because the MP3 version is not available for download on Rhapsody or Yahoo Music.

It was very well acted by all concerned, excellent special effects, some really DARK moments, all that have been described to death in other reviews, such as the mobile phone in the stomach, blowing people up etc along with the Joker, the amazing Heath Ledger (I liked him better in a Knight's Tale but he is pretty good in Dark Knight) running around Gotham City like maddened clown on prozac, not to mention Michael Caine as Batman's butler, and Batman himself, a troubled soul who doesn't know if he himself is good or bad?<br /><br />Worth going to see if you really the big cinema experience but I would have been happy to wait for it to come out on DVD, it was good but it's not in my top ten of movies.

The film is a stand alone piece of greatness that is worthy of seeing more than once.  This LP is not,  however,  that great without the imagery.  ABBA needs no imagery to please the listener.

1594489505|5.0|What more can be said about \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\"?  It is an astonishingly good novel and proves without doubt that Hosseini is no one-hit literary wonder.  Whilst I didn't get into it from the get-go the way I did with \\"The Kite Runner\\", that is a minor quibble.  The plotline and main characters are remarkable, memorable and heartbreaking.  The novel gives a unique perspective on the living hell that is everday life in Kabul, Afghanistan, told through the eyes of two women at very different stages in their lives who are brought together in heartbreaking circumstances.  They have to endure living their lives in a manner that I find horrific to contemplate, and Hosseini really brings to life their unlikely friendship and struggle to endure intolerable personal circumstances.  I cannot recommend \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" highly enough and have given it a 5-Star rating.

0575077174|5.0|The word that best captures reading Reynold's writing is, 'relief.'  His writing is clear, but not cold; it's lyrical, but not flowery; it's as emotional as it is logical.  Alastair Reynolds has the ability to describe complex action simply and to build alien scenery effortlessly.<br /><br />Reynolds' writing talent goes back to his university years--he has talked about having to take chemistry twice because he was doing so much writing.  And, while Reynolds had a substantial career as an astrophysicist, his basic processing is as much verbal as it is numeric/scientific.  Lucky for us, his efforts to understand hard science taught him to create film with words--his writing is like movies.  The impression is of watching Industrial-Light-and-Magic-type special effects; descriptions of cities, gardens, three-dimensional action sequences involving multiply detailed spaceships, exobiological creatures, and large scale astronomical phenomena are so clear that it's as if we walk among them.  (Or dodge them at extralight speeds, as the case may be.)<br /><br />Which isn't to say that this is an action-movie brought to life, with nothing else to offer:  House of Suns works on an emotional level as well--it isn't boring or mean or technical, except in service of a very compelling story.  This is good stuff, and well worth the wait.

I have just started to tackle level 3 some, and it is a killer.  The walking plank is awesome!  Good luck :)

Now if you are wanting to start a company and would like to learn from one of the best in the world, Jobs is the man. If you have a kindle this book is $9.99 thats the way I got it.

B0000028RR|5.0|Probably the only rap-metal album that honestly qualifies as any good, and definitely the most violently liberal album I've ever heard in my life. Not like I mind, of course. But if you don't agree with the politics, it'll probably hurt your enjoyment of the album. Enough of that, though. The point is that this band is awesome. Especially guitarist Tom Mollero, who comes up with brilliant riffs throughout and throws in all kinds of innovative, crazy solos that don't sound like they're coming from a guitar. The solo on \\"Killing in the Name\\" sounds like it could've came from a synthesizer, for instance. The stuff he pulls on \\"Take the Power Back\\" sounds like turntable work or something, his solo on \\"Bullet in the Head\\" seems a lot like a clavinet, and the squeals on \\"Fistful of Steel\\" could be a siren going off. But it's all guitar! I don't even know what to call the stuff in \\"Township Rebellion,\\" but since no keyboards, synthesizers, or sampling was used in the making of this record, that's guitar too, I guess. He even manages to somewhat save the turgid \\"Settle for Nothing\\" with a quiet, jazzy solo. And then there's Zack de la Rocha, easily the angriest of all the angry young men of the '90s. His rants are awesome, whether they're the \\"You're gonna burn!\\" chorus in \\"Bombtrack\\" (which owns, by the way), the infamous \\"f*** you, I won't do what you tell me\\" bits from the absolutely fantastic \\"Killing in the Name,\\" or the \\"ALL OF WHICH ARE AMERICAN DREAMS!\\" segment of \\"Know Your Enemy.\\" I'm also a fan of bassist Tim Commerfield, who manages to play both melodically and funkily throughout (\\"Take the Power Back,\\" \\"Bullet in the Head\\"), and him and drummer Brad Wilk know how to keep a solid, very funky groove, which gives them cool points (\\"Bombtrack,\\" \\"Bullet in the Head\\"). On top of that, most of their songs have multiple parts! I like multipart songs. \\"Killing in the Name\\" has something like three - a weird, effects-laden guitar intro that for some reason always makes me think I'm listening to some one besides Rage, this really cool part where it sounds like Tom is dueling with himself, and the main part of the song. \\"Know Your Enemy\\" has a slow, funky intro with another clavinet-guitar part, a fast, hard, punk-funk part, and a slow metal section that features Tool's Manyard James Keenan on vocals, \\"Wake Up\\" (featured in The Matrix, which means it would be good even if it was bad, which it isn't) speeds up and slows down and has a brief but fascinating build-up section. \\"Freedom\\" speeds up and changes its guitar tone so much, you'd think it wasn't one song, but several different ones mashed together. I'm not a huge fan of the song itself (de la Rocha's screams sound constipated, which isn't a good thing), but it's not bad, and the complete changes it makes are unpredictable, which is a good thing. Really, the only problem with the album is that it's really limited. It must be said that, once you've heard one Rage song, you've kind of heard them all. But you should hear... fifteen, twenty, I'm guessing? And yes, ten of them should be from this album.e think I'm listening to some one besides Rage, this really cool part where it sounds like Tom is dueling with himself, and the main part of the song. \\"Know Your Enemy\\" has a slow, funky intro with another clavinet-guitar part, a fast, hard, punk-funk part, and a slow metal section that features Tool's Manyard James Keenan on vocals, \\"Wake Up\\" (featured in The Matrix, which means it would be good even if it was bad, which it isn't) speeds up and slows down and has a brief but fascinating build-up section. \\"Freedom\\" speeds up and changes its guitar tone so much, you'd think it wasn't one song, but several different ones mashed together.

1932907009|5.0|I highly recommend this book. After struggling with several drafts of a script for years, I was given a copy of Save the Cat by a friend. I eagerly read and followed the suggestions and within two months had a completed version of the script that is greatly improved over any of the other drafts I wrote. I am now actively shopping the completed script to production companies and have made it through the first act of a second script following the beat sheet laid out in the book.     Save the Cat has helped me more than any other screenwriting book I have ever read (and there are many). It was enjoyable to read, lays out a clear strategy and when you apply all the tools suggested, it really does help shape your story. The hard part is still writing the actual script, but with Save the Cat as a guide, the process became a lot easier.

0321544080|5.0|Education, entertainment and impressive imagery. Joe educates us with lots of advice and by giving us explanations of how he created some of the images in the book.  He entertains us with war stories from his career and he certainly impresses us with his imagery.  One could easily imagine this book as a PowerPoint presentation. For each two-page spread we get a bullet item that relates some advice, an image to demonstrate this advice and the story behind the image.  For some images we also get a fuller explanation of some aspect of photography (i.e. lighting) that pertains to the creation of the image.<br /><br />This book is not a substitute for a book focusing solely on lighting or one on composition, exposure, the use of color or the like.  It is also not a business practice manual. It's light on all of these but inhabits the tough middle area where it has some value in all of these and other areas. I did come away with the realization that the work to create the images in this book was usually more laborious than Joe let on as he made it look easy. I attribute this to Joe's talent and experience and that for him it would indeed be much easier to do this than if we tried this ourselves in the real world. I'm okay with that as this book doesn't pretend to be a thick textbook book on some aspect of photography or a detailed autobiography.  In all, it was an entertaining, educational and inspiring read.
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|I was really excited to hear that R.E.M. had returned to a more rock and roll style of music.  The album has continued to grow on me as time has passed.  It is no \\"Monster\\" but in a similar vein.  I was originally struck by the struggling voice of Michael Stipe to rise above the chiming guitar work.  But, it really isn't so bad.  \\"Until The Day Is Done\\" is still a favorite track.  You don't have to be a lefty to see the truth in these lyrics.  \\"Accelerate\\" is almost up there with Sheryl Crow's \\"Detours\\" and Lenny Kravitz's \\"It Is Time For A Love Revolution\\" for the year 2008.  All of these albums are full of songs that signal a need for change in this country.  I like the quote from Sinclair Lewis that \\"when fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross.\\"  No truer words have been said.  Like I mentioned, I'm not the biggest liberal in the world, but a change in direction of this country's leadership has been direly needed.  I'm afraid Obama is not the answer, but a country that caters to the rich and forgets the ones working hard and struggling to make it is a nation in deep trouble!  Thanks to R.E.M. for returning to its roots in rock music as well as lyrical depth!
B00140PK6O|5.0|One of the best series ever watched.  Only England could do such a period piece - wonderful.
0375701427|3.0|Amer pastoral    In this novel, Roth's alter ego Nathan Zuckerman (\\"Skip\\") returns to his beloved northern New Jersey--in this case, Newark, during the halcyon days of the 40's and 50's. Back then, Newark was a thriving city of immigrants, many of them Jewish, who worked harder than we can possibly imagine today, but indeed caught the golden ring and realized the American Dream. Growing up, Skip lived in an innocent world of sports and school, worshipping the magical Swede, so-called because this blond god didn't look Jewish. Swede was an athlete and hero, and a look or a kind word from him was enough to send a young boy to Cloud 9. Swede grows up to live out a Jewish version of the American fantasy--he marries Miss New Jersey, buys the old stone mansion of his dreams, has a daughter, and lives the life of an upper middle class WASP. But it all turns into nightmare as daughter Merry grows up and gets caught up in the turmoil of the 60's.    Many consider \\"American Pastoral\\" Roth's masterpiece, and it won a Pulitzer. But as a Roth fan, I was disappointed. Was this story merely Skip's imagining of what had happened in the Swede's life? I tended to think so, which might explain the lack of immediacy I felt as I read. Too much of the second half of the book consists of Zuckerman's imaginings of the obsessions in Swede's mind as his personal American dream turns into a hellish nightmare. I felt as if I was going round and round in this poor guy's brain, never to escape. No doubt that's what Roth wanted to convey, but I found it wearing. I find other works of Roth far more compelling, \\"The Plot Against America\\"  [[ASIN:1400079497 The Plot Against America]] and \\"The Human Stain\\"  [[ASIN:0375726349 The Human Stain: A Novel]] among them. If you felt the same as I did about \\"Pastoral\\" don't give up on Roth; try these others.
B00005JPS8|5.0|We are a large family (9 of us), and all of us enjoy superhero movies. My husband is a comic book geek, and we have all learned about the DC and Marvel universes via osmosis. In other words, we know our comic book heroes.<br /><br />Ironman far outshines all other comic-based movies to date. This movie has the rare mixture of a comic book feel, great story, characters you care about, AND...NO Cheese. I was hesitant when they cast Downey for the part- I am a huge fan, but felt he would not make a good Tony Stark. I was completely wrong- Downey IS Tony Stark. Flawless. The Director was wise enough to let Downey do what he does best- ad lib. He is a natural comedian, and added just enough humor to turn an ok role into a work of art. This movie would have been average without his comedic presence.<br /><br />Paltrow ended up being a good choice as well. She is like wallpaper most of the movie, present, but not overwhelming. This allows Downey to stay in the spotlight where he belongs.<br /><br />I have seen ALL of the comic based movies, as well as many of the animated straight to DVD as well. Mind you, there are many other good movies. Heath Ledger was INCREDIBLE as the Joker in the latest Batman movie. However, as an overall great comic-based movie, Ironman is going to be really hard to beat as my all-time favorite.<br /><br />I hope there is an Ironman sequel in the planning, and hoping they do as good a job with the Avengers as they did with this one. MArvel has stepped it up a notch. Maybe this will push DC into giving us the Justice League movie we all know they're capable of????
0060920084|1.0|This book was not my first read by Bill Bryson and I will move on to other authors after this read. As I was reading this book I wondered why I had read as much of this author as I have.  Bryson tends to look down his nose at people and things that do not meet his obviously cultured standards. His anger whether displayed or passive aggressive has gotten old.  An example of my disappointment in this book is the author's report of New York City. Bryson couldn't find anything interesting within the 5 boroughs of the city.   His politically correct self contentment is no longer of interest to me.

B0015LB0SO|4.0|T.S. Slaughter's film is probably the most in-your-face bad taste gay film I've ever seen, and I really enjoyed it.  The acting is wonderfully subpar (and recalls early John Waters), the humor all over the place, and the screenplay a punch in the face to the politically correct.  Nathan and Justin are \\"roommates with benefits\\" that are bored of their college lives and decide to get even with the \\"Ivy\\" boys by abducting, raping and killing them.  Michael Burke is particularly wonderful as Justin -- his line \\"You're awesome, Nathan!\\" becomes funnier every time he delivers it.  This is certainly not a film for everyone (the easily offended need not apply), but based on sheer audacity alone Skull & Bones is a must-see for viewers with alternative tastes.  If you like touching tales of coming out and loving gay relationships, this is a must-avoid!

B0013USZHG|5.0|Gustavo Dudamel and the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela are in their element with this selection of Latin American music. Senemaya and the dances from Estancia are familiar but the remaining tracks (Leonard Bernstein excepted) were by composers entirely new to me.     Sensemaya was based on a poem called Chant to Kill a Snake and was given an archaic feel by Silvestre Revueltas that sounds quite ominous and is magnificently performed by the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra. Margeritena by Inocente Carreno is a majestic piece based on Venezuelan popular songs, and while it may be European in his orchestration Carreno is magnificent in expressing his love of his homeland.  I had the feeling that I was given a musical tour of Venezuela.  Antonio Estevez's Mediodia en el Liano is a more reflective and elegiac work that describes the grasslands of Venezuela. Originally, this short work was part of a larger suite but the other movements were cut by the composer.  Mediodia en el Liano is a very colorful piece that has the feel of awe inspired by the broad landscape.      Danzon No. 2 by Arturo Marquez is a very popular work and is considered Mexico's second national anthem.   The music begins quietly and slowly builds across the orchestra as the tempo switches to a dance rhythm.  Fuca con Pajarillo by Aldemaro Romero is a tuneful work based on the Venezuelan dance pajarillo.  In this piece the dance melody is worked into a fugue with contracting melodies.      The dances from Estancia are played with true passion and certainly challenge the recordings I currently have of the music. Santa Cruz de Pacairigua by Evencio Castellanos is inspired by the festival of the same name that is characterized by parties with a great deal of drinking and dancing. The composer was a collector of Venezuelan folk music and this work show its influence. The final work, Mambo, by Leonard Bernstein is played with true abandon by the orchestra.     This is a marvelous disc that was certainly one of discovery for me and I come away from it wanting to hear more.  This is one that is not to be missed if you are interested in Gustavo Dudamel.
0151013047|4.0|This book is absorbing and hard to put down. I read it in one afternoon. The plot is that of a young Pakistani who has gone through Princeton with complete financial aid and, as the author writes, \\"invited into the ranks of the meritocracy,\\" by being hired by a top notch valuation firm in NYC. At first he fits in beautifully. Or does he? The initial interview with Jim from the firm makes him \\"uncomfortable,\\" and \\"puts him off balance.\\" And we find that he's been covering up the fact that he had to hold three jobs at Princeton. And when he's offered the job, he had the sense that perhaps this job would \\"transform my life.\\" At first it did as he threw himself into it, impressing everyone with his intelligence and energy. But on the first project in Manila, before finding out about the 9/11 events, the narrator finds himself being stared at with hostility by a jitney driver. \\"...his dislike was so obvious, so intimate, that it got under my skin....I remained preoccupied with this matter far longer than I should have, pursuing several possibilities that all assumed--as their unconscious starting point--that he and I shared a sort of Third world sensibility.\\" He then feels disconnected from his colleagues but again the work takes over and these feelings are forgotten until a day or so later when watching TV he sees the collapse of the WTC buildings. And one could say the life he has been living unravels from there and he ends up back in Pakistan talking to this mysterious American at a cafe in Lahore.     The feelings of alienation and confusion come across strongly in the author's writing. On one level you can read this book as a look at a Muslim experiencing the world after the events on 9/11. This will resonate with some readers and probably alienate others. On another level you can read it as the story of anyone who has moved from one world to another whether by changing countries, social class, or educational levels from the background they come from. Here it leavesthe genre of \\"thriller\\" and becomes a very human story of one man trying to reconcile competing desires and values in a complex world.     The ending is ambiguous and I appreciated that. There are no cut and dried answers to the issues raised in the course of the evening's discussion.     My only criticism of the story is the almost uni-dimensional character of Erica. The dialogue between the two is often stilted and she basically comes across as not quite there. That's why I gave the book four stars.
1401308201|5.0|This is not only an info book, but you can take it as a superdeluxe hand program that tells you everything from how the writer came up with the story plot, to the producers and composer idea of making it a musical. It brings beautiful photos and illustrations that will immerse you into the world of Oz, where this spellbinding story takes place. You'll find out about the cast's opinions of their characters, the creatives point of view of their decissions from dressmaking to even stage design. Everythig a Musical theater lover should have in a one piece book.

031606792X|1.0|The fourth book is disappointing because it lacks story and because of it's lame message.  A girl does not have to give up everything to get the boy she loves.  And what's wrong with a girl being comfortable with her sexuality?  I mean, is it necessary that she beg Edward to have sex with her?      I enjoyed the other three books very much but I always had trouble with the white knight theme of always having to save the poor, clumsy girl.  She shows moments of strength but in the end she always gives into Edward's or Jacob's needs.    Overall, I feel like Meyer had little vision for this final act.  It's not creative in any plot points and the characters are one dimensional.  And the imprinting element is just creepy.  There were times in reading all these books that I felt like Meyer had religious agendas that she veiled deftly in interesting characters.  This device was exposed in this volume. I wouldn't recommend this book.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Before I discuss the show in some depth, I want to state that this tv series' episodes are often more enjoyable the 2nd or 3rd time around - same as other popular paranormal shows - especially the X-Files.

The true bonding of the brothers really becomes apparent in Season Two. The THIRD SEASON - all actors finally have a well-oiled fit/working relationship that allow the episodes to move in a more realistic fashion. My favorite episode (and it is hard to really pick only one) is the where Dean dies in over a hundred different ways while Sam repeats the same Tuesday over and over again. The episode is funny, emotional with brotherly love, and the determination by Sam to stop the cycle of seeing his brother die day after day. The premise of repeated time has a common appeal for I've seen it in other shows with interesting outcomes (e.g. Star Trek Next Generation, X-Files, and most recently in the relatively new series Eureka - to name a few). In all three seasons, I particularly enjoy the banter between the brothers over the course of a beer or two at the end of the day - definitely more down-to-earth characters than in many other sci-fi/paranormal tv series.

031606792X|5.0|I am confused by all the bad reviews.  IF you have really read the entire series I don't know why you would be surprised by any of the events that Stephenie Meyer wrote in Breaking Dawn.  Her writing skills were not diminished in this book.  I went on the same emotional roller coaster as I did with the other books.  This book brought on conclusions and a closure that all fans would be able to appreciate.  On the last page, all I could think was, \\"That was perfect.\\"  That was my final thought.  These characters were fictional but real and Stephenie Meyer gave me a great gift when she wrote these books.

Sometimes the end of a series can be majorly disappointing and the 3rd book was not my favorite so I was a little skeptical about Breaking Dawn. But wow, I was not disappointed. I think this is by far the best of all her books. I enjoyed learning more about Edward now that he could be his full self around Bella. And I thought how she ended Jacobs story (so far anyway) was great. I was a little peeved at how Bella seemed to tease him, especially in books 2 and 3 but Breaking Dawn kind of clears all that up as to why they had such and \\"infatuation\\" for each other. Well written. I loved it.

It's a fast paced, action film with an intelligent story! The DVD transfer looks great and this film was followed by a sequel!
0307386171|2.0|I may have missed it, but did Ian McEwan recently move to that Greek monastery where the don't allow any females of any species? You would think he'd never met a woman in his life from reading \\"On Chesil Beach,\\" a minor character study that's not really worth even the short time it takes to get through. McEwan's attempts to inhabit the mind of a woman in post-war England are laughably inept--although he works hard to get the period details right the character rings false all the way through. The author also seems to suffer from that modern misconception that everyone born before 1960 had no idea how babies are made--how does he think he got here? And  the, er, climactic scene is more worthy of a soap opera scribe than a major novelist. The only time this novel works is when he's describing the male character's class resentment: that's where McEwan's talent lies and he'd be better off applying his much over-praised abilities to culture-clash stories like Atonement and Saturday.  In all, a bad day at the beach.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|The Bourne series is more like an installment than three separate films, but I will say they don't disappoint! This is another solid, smart action film with our new hero doing what he does best!.......outsmarting and out fighting his enemies every step of the way. This installment leaves the door open for yet another sequel!......This could go on as long as the Bond series! The DVD has a great transfer.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I remember the sound almost a decade ago. The beauty of her voice, her heart-wrenching lyrics. She was the diva at the turn of the century! She is still the model for pop/rock/folk singer-songwriters today. This album is simply stunning.
B00005JCCE|3.0|What's not to like about this film, Robin Williams plays yet another caring doctor who wants only to help people. It's all strangely familiar.....if you've seen 'Awakenings', a much better film if you ask me. I did enjoy this predictable film, but the character's have no depth. We have the kooky crazy people, the mean head physician and so on and so on. This would not be a problem if this was a comedy, but with the subject matter at hand, it really is a drama. It's based on a true story, about a man who thinks outside the box. I love people who think outside the box, if only the director had.........it could have been an exceptional film, as it is, it's a decent feel good film with a rather uneven tone. The DVD has a very good transfer.
B00000IAU3|3.0|I was honestly expecting more, after reading the reviews and acclaim. But this album is simply average. It takes from a wide range of sources in which the music is just simply done better! Her voice is average at best, with no substance that would make it attractive were it not for the production of the sound. The lyrics are cheesy and corny and plain dumb. I'm not sold!
B000E1MXSW|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies of Audrey Hepburn.  I have the VHS and wore it out.  I was very glad to see it released on DVD.  So many of my favorite classic movies are not released on DVD.  The Nun's Story is an enthralling story of a young idealistic young woman who was brilliant in medicine thanks to the tutelage of her doctor father.  Upon learning that the man she loves carries genes that will pass on severe mental disabilities, they decided that it wouldn't be right to marry.  Gabrielle decides that since her life in the world was essentially over, the convent would be her best option.  She works hard to become the perfect nun.  Along with all the spiritual struggles she went thru, she was also able to obtain degrees in tropical medicine (the first step towards service in the Congo) to one in psychiatry.  Sister Luke's spiritual troubles make you want to reach out and hug her, to let her know that she wasn't a bad nun and an excellent nurse.  It was obvious that she would have made a cracker jack doctor herself if the conventions of the time would have allowed her to attend medical school.  Even tho this movie has religious overtones, it was, nevertheless a fantastic movie and the scenes that were shot on site in the Belgium and the Congo were breathtaking.  I adored the author of the book, Kathrine Hulme for many many years.  I first read the book in 10th grade and loved it.  I have a very dog-eared paperback copy that has been well loved.  Only with the advent of used book merchants was I actually able to obtain a hard cover copy of the book.  If you like Audrey Hepburn, you'll love her in this.  Along with Audrey Hepburn, the picture had a load of top notch stars.  If you don't mind the religious overtones, the movie is an excellent one to watch and the book is even better.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|My husband,though not being a movie fan, got up each morning anticipating the next segment.  We were awed by what our founding fathers endured in order to make life so good for us.  Soon afterwards, we saw another movie about someone who had never voted and he was incensed that anyone would have the gall to ignore that for which others had given so much and some had given their lives.  Should be required viewing in history and government classes!
0930289234|5.0|Excellent book!  Its an absolute must read whether you are a comic book fan or not!
0385340990|5.0|I admit it--the title of this novel almost scared me off.  It sounds like one of those novels seemingly created for book clubs, one of those novels that I just cannot enjoy.  I'm a bit of a curmudgeon about sappy, sentimental novels, and I was concerned that this was one of them.  The wonderful reviews convinced me to give it a try and wow am I happy I did.  This book is a delight from start to finish, perfect for anyone who loves books and bookstores.  I would recommend this book to everyone, really, even the crankiest of readers.  The novel takes place in post-WWII England and is written entirely in letters, in my opinion, a risky tack, but one that works perfectly here.  Juliet is a writer in search of her next topic when she receives a letter from a stranger on Guernsey in search of Charles Lamb's books.  Juliet finds out about a book group formed on the island, her curiousity is piqued and more letters, from many on the island, fly back and forth.  The characters in the novel are so wonderful and the writing is terrific--everything works here perfectly.  This novel made me laugh out loud and cry real tears--I highly recommend it.  Enjoy!
B000ERU5EK|5.0|Great album. I was unsure about getting this album at first because I only knew the one song \\"Can't Sleep,\\" but I'm glad I got it. It's an easy album to listen to.
0920236820|5.0|Although this fairy tale is a nearly thirty-year-old classic, it is still timely for girls.  The book was a birthday present for a great granddaughter named Elizabeth, who loved reading a story about a heroine who shares her name.  But the book pleased her even more because Elizabeth the heroine is smart and brave, and learns that sometimes handsome princes are just silly and not worth the trouble.<br /><br />(The illustrations are classic as well, and will appeal to children.)
B000JVT1U0|5.0|If you are into Freddie Krueger, Leatherface or Jason ... this movie probably is not for you (though I could be wrong).  Basically this a story of the conflict between Christianity (represented by Edward Woodward's SGT Howie) and Paganism (represented by Christopher Lee's Lord Summerisle and the people of his island).  Sometimes called the \\"Citizen Kane\\" of horror movies, it isn't really a horror film at all.  In some ways THE WICKER MAN defies labels.  It isn't quite a horror film and it isn't completely a psychological thriller.  It isn't simply a conflict between old religion/new religion.  It is all of them and something more.  It is strange and erotic at the same time.  Sex is a major theme or perhaps more rightly, reproduction.  That is the core of the conflict and the reason for SGT Howie, ultimately, coming to Summerisle -- though he does not know it at the time.  Woodward and Lee are standout as is Diane Cilento.  Rod Stewart once tried to buy the negative of this movie to have it destroyed -- it featured his then girlfriend Brit Eklund in a nude dance.  To appreciate this movie you really do have to view it more than once.  The extended version works better in my view.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Amazing version. Branagh makes Hamlet enjoyable for the Shakespeare buff or the reluctant viewer. Easy to follow, incredibly visual, epic performances from an all star cast. Highly, highly recommended.
1423101464|5.0|My husband, 10 year old son and I have been following the Percy Jackson saga - and this latest installment did not disappoint.  The old characters are back and though they are consistent there is appropriate growth.  Plenty of new monsters, new obstacles, and a very satisfying continuation of the larger plot.  We look forward to the next book!!!
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I ENJOYED ALL OF THE SONGS AND WAS INTRODUCED TO SOME NEW ONES.  IF YOU'RE ROMANTIC OR NOSTALGIC....THIS CD IS FOR YOU......GO ROMANCE!!!!!!
B0013LPS7U|5.0|2 complete CDs, both a joy for different reasons: the original songs bring back a sense of nostalgia for the band's exuberant beginnings, and the new tracks of live recordings and some never before released are a delightful surprise. It's a complete U2 package for those who really love this band. Comes with a very polished book with historical photos, retrospective by Paul Morley and comments by The Edge on the rare and unreleased tracks. It's worth the extra expense if you want to go deeper into the U2 catalog.
B00004RF97|5.0|Perhaps not my favorite classic, but The Philadelphia Story is a great adaptation of the play with some of the greatest actors of their day.<br /><br />Now I am only twenty so this was out far before my years, but it certainly kept my attention and will sit high in my list of favorite films.<br /><br />Macaulay Connor(James Stewart) stumbling around with Tracy Lord(Katharine Hepburn) drunk on champagne, and previously meeting with C.K. Dexter Haven(Cary Grant)  in my mere opinion is oscar worthy in itself.<br /><br />\\" Well, this is where Cinderella gets off, now you hurry back to the ball before you turn into a pumpkin and six white mice, goodbye. \\"<br /><br />Not to mention I adore anything where Katharine Hepburn plays a cold, but misunderstood woman of privilege.  Oh wait...<br /><br />It is a film I will truly treasure in my collection.
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|The movie was great.  It was action packed, and surprised me many times.  The purchase was easy and it arrived promptly and as advertised.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Possibly my favorite romance of all time, ROMAN HOLIDAY is a heart-wrenching, charming and timeless tale of a young Princess Ann(Audrey Hepburn) who runs away and ends up in the arms of wise newspaperman Joe Bradley(Gregory Peck).<br /><br />Of course through a handful of events by random happenstance Joe and Ann fall in love, and their chemistry is really beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Do you have a silk nightgown with rosebuds?\\" \\"I haven't worn a nightgown in years!\\"<br /><br />Gregory Peck is a dream, and Audrey Hepburn is simply stunning in her oscar-winning performance. In addition, Eddie Albert adds the perfect amount of 'comedy relief'.<br /><br />It's one of those movies that you never feel the desire to fast-forward through and the end will make your heart shatter no matter how many times you have seen it unfold before.<br /><br />Couldn't you just die as he exits and 'the end' comes up on that screen?  Just Amazing.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|\\"Wicked\\" gets my vote for the best musical, possibly of all time!<br /><br />Saw the play in NYC, bought the cast recording.<br /><br />I've seen maybe 100 plays on Broadway and our local Tony Award-winning venue, Cincinnati's Playhouse in the Park, but...<br /><br />I have never seen, after a song (\\"If only for this moment\\"), the entire audience standing, cheering and most of us crying - and this is not the end of the play, just one of several songs that brought tears and cheers from most of the audience.  To say the music is exceptional would be a vast understatement!  Never heard better!  Probably won't again either.<br /><br />Jerry G.
B0011UBDTK|2.0|and I have been unable to get an answer if those disks can be replaced.    This is not a rating about the series - of course only fans would buy the set to watch - but the quality of the product is not what one would expect.
B0001Z37HM|2.0|A minor character in a Robert E. Howard historical story, Marvel turned it into a monthly character in the same world as Conan.  Dino (\\"My Konk is big!\\") De Laurentis brought it to the big screen with director Richard Fleischer, fresh off his failed CONAN THE DESTROYER. If anything, this bugger is even worse.  Now I know that is saying alot. Arnold is in it as a character who is really SUPPOSED to be Conan and Brigitte Nielson in the title role.  Sandahl Bergman (Valeria in CTB) is an evil queen in pursuit of a deadly orb of power and wiping out anyone in her path.
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|good album, but i could not give it 5 stars. sorry guys i guess i'll always love the first the best no matter what.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|For MGM this was a major \\"A\\" when it was released -- something they wouldn't do again until the late 1960's with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. This was an obvious influence on shows like Star Trek and Lost in Space.  Leslie Nielson in his leading man days, the ever beautiful Anne Francis, Walter Pigeon, Jack Kelly (pre-Maverick), a very young Earl Holliman (Police Woman), Richard Anderson (Oscar Goldman on The Six Million Dollar Man and not to be confused with Richard DEAN Anderson of McGyver fame).  Then again, who can forget Robbie the Robot, the magnificent Krell machines and a plot based on The Bard's \\"The Tempest\\".
0307394549|2.0|With a title of \\"Martha Stewart's Cookies\\" and her smiling picture plastered on the cover one would expect Martha Stewart to have written the cookbook. Instead it's \\"From The Editors of Martha Stewart Living\\" magazine and as such appears to be a compilation of recipes and features that have run in the magazine.<br /><br />After the table of contents, there is a multi page section of pictures of various cookies with their name and what page the recipe is on. The cookies are listed in general categories such as \\"light and delicate, crumbly and sandy, chunky and nutty, cakey and tender, crisp and crunchy\\" and \\"rich and dense\\" with the corresponding page number for the section.<br /><br />\\"Light and delicate\\" section begins our journey through 175 cookie recipes. The section starts off with \\"Meringue Porcupines,\\" before moving through \\"Fortune Cookies, Bratseli, Langues-De-Chat, Peanut Butter and Jelly Bars\\" among many others listed in this section which began on page 20. Most of the recipes are not simple and require some dexirity with kitchen appliances, pastry bags, etc. to achieve anything close to the items picture here. There are a few pictures of items in various stages of preparation, but the pictures are small and therefore doing not provide much detail.<br /><br />The \\"soft and chewy\\" cookies take over starting on page 56. Of course, one would expect a recipe for \\"Soft and Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies\\" and there is one. Also included are recipes for \\"Coconut Macaroons, Chocolate Macaroons, Chocolate Malt Sandwiches, Whole-Wheat Date Bars\\" and many others. The same format is used with most of the pictures in this section depicting the finished product.<br /><br />At page 104 the book shifts to consider \\"crumbly and sandy\\" cookies. \\"Almond Horns, Pecan Logs, Springerle, Apple-Cheery Crumble Bars, Sand Tarts\\" and many more cookie recipes make up this section. The same format continues and again in this chapter, most of these are labor intensive cookies requiring lots of experience in the kitchen.<br /><br />\\"Chunky and nutty\\" is the next section starting on page 164. \\"Rocky Ledge Bars, Banana-Walnut  Chocolate-Chunk Cookies, Pine Nut Cookies, Magic Blondies\\" and many more appear here. All appetizing and all carried in the same format as earlier ones in the book.<br /><br />Page 188 marks \\"cakey and tender\\" with items such as \\"Lemon Madelines, Lebkuchen, Raspberry Almonds Blondies\\" and many others. All delectable and nearly all very complicated to make and depicted in the same format used throughout the book.<br /><br />Page 218 marks the start of \\"crisp and crunchy\\" with such one as \\"Chocolate-Orange-Espresso Thins, Chocolate Pretzels, Striped Icebox Cookies, Chocolate Sandwiches\\" and others.<br /><br />\\"Rich and dense\\" begins on  page 264 with items such as \\"Baci di Dama , Chocolate Thumbprints, Truffle Brownies, Rugelach Fingers\\" and many others .<br /><br />Starting on page 306 there is a section on \\"tools and techniques.\\" Here you will find information on ingredients, tools for making dough or shaping the dough, and information on how to drop dough, decorating cookies and other useful items. There are pictures, but they are small like most of the pictures in this book so detail is hard to come by.<br /><br />Now that you have made the cookies you have to know something about \\"packing and giving.\\" Starting on page 328 this section is devoted to various ways to present the efforts of your hard won labor via sacks, cookie drums, window boxes, etc.<br /><br />A list of sources for ingredients and supplies, a listing of photo credits and an index bring this paperback cookbook to a close. A cookbook that you will have to pin down in some way without breaking the spine to use. And a cookbook that does feature delectable recipes which are very complicated.<br /><br />Beyond the fact there is no reference to dietary information at all as well as the fact that is done by the editors of her magazine instead of Martha which is a bit misleading since this info is inside and not on the cover, the biggest issue is the recipes themselves. No doubt they are \\"the very best treats to bake and to share.\\" They are also very complicated, very labor intensive and rather impossible to do unless one has numerous people under their command to take care of things while one is the kitchen or anything to do beyond being in the kitchen. While the book is decent, except for the small pictures, it doesn't really matter because the book isn't practical for many cooks. Like most of her books, her magazines and her TV show, it operates in the principal that there is nothing else to do.<br /><br />For those of us who truly have our hands full with a job, child care, and a host of other issues, the book simply doesn't work.<br /><br />Kevin R.

0316067601|5.0|This book was an inspiration to me!! I have a whole new level of respect for our men in uniform and these men in particular. The first half of the book is slow, but sets a good base for the rest of the story. This is a must read for every American!
0937381888|5.0|This book was just what I needed to help me understand my fanatic friend who can't stop talking about brewing...although I have to admit, the beer is very good!   It is just what I needed to get me started.
0385340567|1.0|I LOVE Reacher. One of my favorite all-time fiction lines is from The Hard Way:    Reacher. Alone in the dark. Invincible.    This book ranks at the bottom on the Reacher list, primarily because I don't need lectures about the war in Iraq and the evil administration that hates its soldiers. Leave out the politics next time, Lee.    Otherwise, it was okay. But I read Lee Child to get better than okay.
B000002G9S|5.0|I bought this on vinyl when it first came out and was blown away then and now I have it on CD and the revisit blew me away again. These guys were really something special and this CD creates an atmosphere and a feel that is like no other. Blues-based rock to the extreame. Andy Frasier's bass playing is amazing in the way that it is a constant driving second lead guitar weaving in and out with Paul Kossoff's tasteful and emotion filled leads and perfectly chosen power chords. Rodgers never sounded more powerful or raw than on this recording. Songs like Mr Big and Oh I wept really mark the point where the band puts a very unique twist on the sound of that era. They had the ability to bring the tempo down to a near stop when only using the barest of progression while still carrying the raw emotions of the vocals and then would take you back to an explosion of power that left you blown away. Although I loved Bad Company, I never felt they reached the level of class that Free had. I personally would give this CD a 10 star rating if I could.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|This is a wonderful production. So smart and very entertaining.My husband and I loved it.

B0015KGWPG|5.0|[[ASIN:B0015KGWPG Emma complete illustrated novel by Jane Austen]]    Austen's witty exploration of social relationships in \\"Emma\\" is both humorous and insightful. An enjoyable read for everyone.
0375805613|5.0|I received great service and the book was promptly delivered.  This book was read to me as a child and to my children when they were little.  I purchased it to read to my grandaughter which I have happily done.  It's a great \\"fun\\" book for children.
0375756736|4.0|After finally getting round to reading the books that launched my top three period film loves (P&P [[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]], S&S [[ASIN:0800141660 Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition)]], and best of all Persuasion [[ASIN:B00003JRCQ Persuasion]]), it was fascinating to note what Emma Thompson did and did not use in her screenplay of S&S.<br /><br />As to the novel itself-most surprising and gratifying was the biting satire, wit and  sarcasm in Miss Austen's writing.  Her carefully veiled views on \\"society\\" good and bad will stand as a historical and societal timeline into the era.  A woman's place, or lack thereof, is keenly felt, as is the feeling of helplessness of women with the unfortunate prospect of being born without means. As well as what some women gave up to secure \\"a good match\\".  Knowing Miss Austen's own background, the reader doesn't have to wonder how much of her own life was catalyst for her social commentary dished up in the beguiling text of romance.<br /><br />4 stars-recommended.

B001C08RHA|5.0|next to the Batman film (Dark Knight), Iron Man was by far the most enjoyable action film of summer '08.  Great cast, great script, interesting CGI, well-acted and directed.  I actually had FUN watching this in the theater.  The action scenes with Iron Man in flight were awesome.<br /><br />Downey Jr. adds just the right touch of humor/anger in the role, and Paltrow has never looked more beautiful.<br /><br />I've heard the sequel comes out May 2010....I'll be the first one in line.
B00005NGAK|5.0|Michael Flatley knows how to put on a show.  He took the best of Lord of the Dance and made it bigger and better.  More dancers, more lights and more special effects makes this a spectacular show to watch. In addition to the best Lord of the Dance routines he adds a flute solo, Whispering Wind, with a lovely, haunting melody and His Feet of Flames solo is breathtaking. If you want something to lift up your spirits this will do it.  My husband and I watch it all the time. It's one show you never get tired of seeing.  I only wish it had been filmed in high definition.
B000NIVJHM|5.0|What's not to love?  I'm so glad to have one of my favorite movies in DVD.  The anniversry edition is just a bonus.
B000089CJI|5.0|You know that pivotal scene in \\"Garden State\\" where Natalie Portman's character shows Zach Braff's character a song by The Shins? She says, \\"You gotta hear this one song, it'll change your life I swear,\\" and it literally does set into motion a chain of events that changes his life completely. That is exactly how I feel about The Postal Service's Give Up, an album that changed my life and my perception of what good music is, and what it could be.<br /><br />If you've read my musings before, you're undoubtedly aware of the story of how I first heard this album. Driving with a friend during Spring Break 2004 (whoo!), he puts in this CD and begins plaing \\"Nothing Better.\\" Jimmy Tamborello's bellish synth sound reminds me of when Mario collects a coin, and being the huge video game nerd that I am, that won me over entirely. It was the first time I had heard Ben Gibbard's perfect (album) voice, perfectly complemented not only by Tamborello's flawless composition, but Jen Wood's sugary-sweet vocals. I semi-dated/saw/hung out/got complicated with this girl that very same year and this became our unofficial \\"song.\\" She would sing Jen's lines and I would sing Ben's. It was cheesy, but it was good times.<br /><br />That whole Spring Break I poured over this album. I remember waking up in the morning, walking over to my CD player, pressing play, and then going back to bed where I would lie down, close my eyes and just take it in. The first track, \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" still gives me goosebumps when the music starts and Ben softly croons, \\"Smeeeeared blaaaack ink,\\" practically reaching out through the speakers and pulling me in. It's slow, meandering start makes its uptempo ending all the more exciting, bringing a smile to my face almost always. It's outdone on the album, only by the modern pop classic, \\"Such Great Heights,\\" a song whose lyrics, composition, and performances all achieve a perfection that - up until that time - had never thought possible. Sure, Iron & Wine totally killed the whole carefree, lovey-dovey vibe that this song had going for it, but if anything it makes you appreciate the original that much more.<br /><br />Of course, it's not all hugs and kisses. Songs like \\"Sleeping In\\" and \\"This Place is a Prison\\" show Gibbard taking on a more realistic, less romantic world view. The former song's lyrics are, again, one of the album's high points.  \\"This Place is Prison\\" is definitely the lowest point on Give Up, particularly because of it's lack of energy, though that doesn't keep it from being an interesting listen at all.  When listened to in the context of the album, it's a welcomed change of pace and tone.  \\"Natural Anthem\\" is also a bit different from the rest of the songs.  The longest track on the album, it begins with a solemn violin loop before adding more layers that I can count.  Gibbard doesn't even start singing until the 4 minute mark, and by that time, his voice is the last thing you'd expect to hear from the song.  It sounds almost foreign, but as always, it's particularly lovely.<br /><br />And what would a review of Give Up be without mention of its two most-romantic songs, \\"Clark Gable\\" and \\"Brand New Colony?\\"  \\"Gable\\" tells the story of how Ben grabs a few friends, a camera, and a van, and tries to create the perfect love scene.  Why?  Because he's \\"been waiting since birth to find a love that would look and sound like the movies.\\"  It's a charming song, to be sure, with one of Tamborello's most toned-down compositions on the album.  It never gets in the way, or steps out of line.  \\"Brand New Colony\\" is entirely different, containing more Mario-esque synths and one of the most recognizable starting melodies ever.  Here, Gibbard speaks of his desire to take his lover and start a brand new colony where \\"everything will change.\\"  Jenny Lewis lends her vocals to that line, repeating it beautifully and subtly (Jenny Lewis, subtle?  There's a first!) as she harmonizes with Gibbard.  It is probablythe most beautiful moment on the album, which is saying a lot for such a glorious record.<br /><br />In hindsight, the impact that this album has made on me is clear.  Whether or not that has an influence on how I feel about it is debatable, though I think this is definitely a record that can stand on its own merits.  I didn't even know what indie music was, or even heard of it, until I listened to Give Up.  Though saying it changed my life may sound like an extreme exaggeration, it really has changed so much about my thoughts, tastes, and opinions on the art form.  I hesitate to say that it is my favorite album of all time, though if one were to point a gun to my head and demand an answer, this one probably would flow off the tongue easier than anything else.  The bottom line is that Give Up is a very important album, not only for me, but for indie and electronic music in general.  In my opinion, it is an album without flaw or missteps, one that should undoubtedly be considered a massive achievement in music, and one that I've not grown tired of yet.  Only time will tell if the album remains a favorite of mine, but for right now it's just as magical and beautiful as ever.  That works for me.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\"<br />2. \\"Such Great Heights\\"<br />3. \\"Nothing Better\\"<br />4. \\"We Will Become Silhouettes\\"<br />5. \\"Brand New Colony\\"<br /><br />10 out of 10 Starsalbum, which is saying a lot for such a glorious record.

Key Tracks:  1. \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\"  2. \\"Such Great Heights\\"  3. \\"Nothing Better\\"  4. \\"We Will Become Silhouettes\\"  5. \\"Brand New Colony\\"    10 out of 10 Stars
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Saw the movie 5 times and obviously loved it.  The soundtrack has all the energy of the movie.
B001BGTWXI|4.0|I bought my disc at Best Buy and received the CLEAN version too.  Not a big fan of censorship.....anyways the cd is good. Have not listened to it enough to know if I like it that much. It isn't bad though, well, other than the acoustic song.
0743454537|4.0|I listened to this on the road and it made the time fly, while giving me plenty to think about!  The audio version is perfect for this book - since chapters are each written from a different characters perspective - and they use different voices for each one. This made them just come to life!<br /><br />I've rated this higher than some - because I enjoyed the surprises Piccoult built into the story.  While the ending does come a bit out of the blue --- it left me thinking even more about the theme of the book.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|Watching the series and now the 'Movie' simply takes you to a place as if you either feel like you 'have lived there' OR want too! The movie couldn't have re-written my life with MY 'Mr. BIG' any better, except for the HAPPY ending....whatever! All I can say is, bring plenty of kleenex (I did and I shared too!) because you need it for the tears of sadness, as well as the joy. The ladies ALL had some great \\"Life-Lessons\\" to teach us all, about men in particular. I LOVED IT!!! Every woman should see it!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I've totally enjoyed the music on the Momma Mia CD I have ordered from Amazon.com. I have also ordered the Juno CD and enjoy the music from this CD as well!!!! It it so easy and convenient to order music,dvd's etc. from Amazon.com. Thank you!!!!!!!!
B001BKXUOQ|4.0|I was very hyped for this album and when I got it I thought it was very good. almost every song I like, only a couple I thought were just mediocre. Overall though job well done.
0061440795|5.0|I bought this book because someone suggested to me that it was the French, 50's version of my book.  I was thrilled and delighted by the fast-paced writing, the compelling characters, the wonderful and touching story.  What a compliment to be compared to Francoise Sagan!  I'm only sorry that I didn't find Bonjour Tristesse sooner--it is a book I will definitely reread every few years.
B00188KD1Y|3.0|After the world goes to swell in 2012,<br />a steel mill worker is framed for his wife's death<br />so that he can drive in the death race.<br />These cars are  more like tanks than race cars<br />with machine guns, flame throwers and rocket launchers.<br />They add in female criminal navigators for sex appeal...<br />Jason Statham is the new leading man with sex appeal<br />and martial arts. If this wasn't about the third time this movie<br />with stunts had been made,<br />I might have given it a better rating: it is a sequel...
B00005JMJG|5.0|I rented this movie with my husband, one of our first 'dates' after our seperation.  Since it was marketed as a comedy, i figured it would be good to have some light entertainment since we'd been working through so much heavy stuff.    Ok, no, not light.  Not light at all, esp considering where we were.  Some of the lines at the end had me bawling my eyes out!  She reminds him of all the things which will go wrong in the relationship, and he says, Ok.  That message that, for all the hard, frustrating, awful things that come in a relationship, love is still worth it - of course even a sense of destiny as the movie presents it . . . was not a light message for me at that time!  I loved, loved, loved the movie tho - probably my favorite ever from Jim Carrey, since i'm not a slap-stick fan.  I loved the mixed-up time line, the quirkiness of the main characters, and again, the message about how important our painful memories and experiences are for us.
B0018S6YOE|5.0|if you lik erihanna at all, you should buy this album. i don;t have to skip a single track. I am now a true fan!
0790729407|1.0|This movie, while somewhat interesting, was so historically inaccurate and lopsided it's laughable.  Alan Rickman's performance as Eamonn de Valera deserves particular mention; there's simply no way such a weak-minded man could possibly have served as taoiseach or president of Ireland. There's inadvertent humor in Julia Roberts's attempt at an Irish accent (and where are the strong Irish women so prominent in history?).  If you want to watch a movie about the Irish struggle for independence, watch \\"The Treaty\\" -- it is more interesting and more historically accurate, and it has better acting.
B0006Z2KIY|2.0|Seriously, I don't get the rave reviews for this movie. People I know are ranting about it as if actually came within a mile of such love classics as &#34;Titanic&#34;, &#34;Pearl Harbor&#34;, and &#34;A Walk in the Clouds&#34;. Trust me, it doesn't; this film doesn't set a toe on the royal grounds of films like that. And what beats me is, why? This movie has an excellent story, is based on a breathtakingly moving book, and stuck almost entirely to the book; what went wrong??  Maybe it's the characterizations. Let's start with romantic hero (or maybe fanatic) Noah. The initial meeting between them, so gently lovely in the book, is nothing even close in the movie. Instead of a mutual attraction like the one in the book, we have heroine Ally on a date with someone else and Noah chasing her like some lovesick clown. She's not interested, he won't take no for an answer, and he follows her around the whole date, even hanging from a bar on the ferris wheel, dangling in front of her seat at one point! Is this supposed to be endearing? I found it annoyingly idiotic: this guy isn't a romantic, he's a clownish dope. Eventually, for reasons I can't remember, Ally agrees to a date and finds herself slowly drawn into him. It's beyond me why; his idea of quiet time is lying on a street beneath a traffic light, late at night when the street's deserted. When he does this in front of her, she slowly lies down and joins him on the pavement with a thoughtful look on her face, as though she actually finds what he's doing to be clever or interesting (or maybe I mistook that look on her face; she could have been wondering if he'd resist when she drove him to a mental home. I rather prefer that theory). When a car nearly hits them as they're lying in the street, they scream, jump up and run, and for some reason afterwards Ally decides he's fun enough for her to date again (I guess almost getting killed by a car does give one a thrill). Their relationship progresses ever deeper after that.The good news: Noah's character stops being an idiot and becomes deeper, along with his love for Ally. The bad news? Once Noah gives up the title of date-hungry goofball, Ally's character picks it up. Ally, to my disappointment, becomes a needy chatterbox. In the first sex scene, they go into an abandoned house and begin making love on the floor. Once they're naked and halfway into the act, Ally wrenches her lips from his long enough to say, &#34;Are we really doing it? Are we really having sex?&#34; He grabs her lips again, but she pulls away and says, &#34;No really, are we actually doing this?&#34; Well honey, he's halfway into you and your clothes are lying over there; what do you think? For some reason, the girl doesn't shut up. She keeps yapping about what a big thing it is they're doing and the scene, for me, was totally ruined (judging from poor Noah's exasperated face, it was ruined for him too). Why the director felt the need to give Ally so much unnecessary dialogue at such an unnecessary time is beyond me. This isn't the only time there's a flood of unnecessary chatter, either: when they break up not long afterward, their painful argument ends with Noah hopping in his truck and preparing to speed off. Ally watches in quiet anger and the pathos of the scene is effective..until Ally runs up to the truck and starts yapping in the window &#34;Are we really breaking up? No seriously, are we really doing this, Noah?&#34; Naturally, he gives her a disgusted look and speeds off anyway. WHAT is with this scene? Silent anger one minute, the girl blathering like an idiot in his face the next? Are movies like this the reason people think women can't make up their minds?  The rest of the plot is completely contrived, from them getting back together and face-sucking like mad in a rainstorm, to the scene where they finally make love, with Ally yanking Noah's pants down and Noah carrying her up the stairs with his trousers down around his ankles. And the killer is, itSHOULD have been moving! What's missing? Credibility I guess, or real pathos. The single flawless scene in the movie consists of Ally sitting on Noah's porch in early morning, painting while wrapped in a blanket the night after their love-making. If every scene had been as gentle, as sincere and vulnerable as this, the movie would have soared. Instead, it just came off as a would-be model for a moving film. And this was never more evident than in the very last scenes.  *SPOILERS*  The scenes with Ally and Noah in their old ages are some of the only tolerably moving ones. For those of you unfamiliar with the story, Ally develops Alzheimer's and, by her 80's or so, can't remember who Noah is. He continues to visit her, day after day, pretty much living at the home where she is. The highlight of the film is when Ally regains her entire memory for a fleeting time after Noah tells her the story of their romance, and the film should have ended some time around then. The book ended with Ally regaining her memory again unexpectedly, even without help, and undressing Noah to make love for what may have been the first time in years. The movie, on the other hand, ends with Noah deciding for some reason that it was time to give up forever and die with Ally right then and there on her bed. Ally seems to know what he's talking about, so they lie down quietly and the next scene features a nurse seeing them and running out of the room; the movie then fades out while focused on their dead bodies (my best friend informed me that they had sex, before dying with their clothes on; if that's true, the ending's even more flatly idiotic and cloying than I already thought). Yeah..just dead. Some dumb phony question &#34;Do you think our love can take us away?&#34; or something, then the dead bodies of the dreamy dummies who magically ended their lives and selfishly abandoned their families in the space of a few minutes-old choice. All I can say now is to echo the sentiments of the wise reviewer who said that this method, of two people lying down and dying, should never be tried in a film that's anything other than a Shakespeare. Or, I might add, at least partly moving and genuine. The reason that the director chose to snuff out the two sweet oldsters in the end, after spending the whole darn film portraying their vivid life, vitality and determination to persevere, is a mystery to me. Maybe they ran out of film time; that seems to be the most likely reason, especially considering that the terribly unnecessary death scene was rushed and uneffective to boot.  Don't let anyone fool you into thinking this is a classic on the same plains as a Shakespeare or a Titanic. It's a semi-effective chick flick, and that's it.
B001BGTWXI|3.0|Being a fan of both Slipknot and Stone Sour, this is almost a merge of the two.  My only gripe, Amazon sent me the CLEAN version!  WTF, it didn't say that anywhere in the description.  Thumbs up to Slipknot, down to Amazon.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|This review is short and sweet.  This movie is amazing and finally got the DVD treatment it deserves.  Tim Burton is a genius and this movie is why.  Buy this and buy this now!
B00005NKKY|5.0|Now that Paul and Arthur are well into their 6O's, can this album be also called ''Voices 0f 0ld People''?  Still a classic.  l hope these old Jews keep rocking into their 8O's.
B001BGTWXI|5.0|I have been a Slipknot fan since Day One and I have been waiting for this one since Iowa.  Vol 3 was not the greatest Slipknot album as it went away from what they were at first, and that is this relentless heavy metal band.  This is back to square one with a more mature sound.  This album is the best heavy metal I've heard in a long time.
015206396X|3.0|Well, it isn't The Once and Future King but it is not entirely without merit, either.  Kristin Cashore has written another of the fantasies for which young readers seem to have an unquenchable thirst.  There is really nothing new here, either in terms of plot or of stylistic treatment.  That being said, readers of fantasy, like readers of pulp romances, are not much interested in literary innovation.  It is enough that the characters and their lands have unusual names and that some of them have unusual characteristics.<br /><br />Katsa and Po are interesting characters and could have been fascinating had Ms. Cashore devoted more attention to character development.  Alas, for all their swashing and buckling, and for enough childhood and adolescent trauma to populate a psych ward, they come across in the end as rather predictable, two-dimensional actors.  Beyond that, their action scenes, of which there are many, are curiously flat and unengaging.  The author has difficulty infusing conflict with any real sense of excitement.<br /><br />But enough complaining.  This is a book for preteens and teens, not critics.  Fans of fantasy literature will be captivated by Graceling.  Girls, in particular, may find Katsa a particularly attractive character to whom, in her internal conflicts and confusion, they can relate. The book advances no particularly unorthodox social values; in the end, caring, concern, and respect for others are reinforced, if in unusual ways.<br /><br />This is a book I would not hesitate to recommend as light reading for middle school and high school students, and possibly for those a bit older.
0694003611|5.0|I got this as a gift. It is a precious story of a child resisting falling asleep to no avail.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mom, a huge Donna SUmmer fan from way back when I was growing up.  She immediately put it into her car and she LOVES IT!  Great songs!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Sticks close to the book.
031606792X|3.0|Like others who have written reviews, I have mixed feelings about Breaking Dawn.   SPOILER ALERT****    On a positive note, I flew through the pages. SM's writing is so engaging... and I am happy that Bella ended up with Edward. I also enjoyed Jacob's humor.     Now for the negative...Something felt wrong about Bella becomming a vampire. Part of Edward's charm was his unwillingness to sacrifice Bella's humanity. I don't know, it just felt wrong. Part of me hopes there is another book and it's Bella waking up from one her vivid nightmares. Charlie comforts her and she goes back to her Biology class to realize taht Edward Cullen is just another teen who could use a tan.
B000077VPU|5.0|I loved this DVD. I cried more than once and re-lived a time I  thought had been forgotten.  For any Queen fan, this is a must have! I will continue to watch it and remember for years to come. The second DVD was great seeing the behind-the-scenes views and comments from the contributors also!
B000F8O2PG|5.0|Corin Nemec brought life and extra dynamics to the series. The episodes he appears together with Michael Schanks are the most fun!
B000BO0QHW|4.0|While the title is slightly misleading, as it's basically a compilation up until he signed his deal with Time Warner before \\"Celebration\\", it's a pretty good collection.  It's a little heavy on the covers, but that's not entirely bad because there's no one in smooth jazz who can cover R&B classics like Norman can, and he does it well here with covers of classics like \\"Any Love\\", \\"After the Love Is Gone\\" and \\"For the Love of You\\".
031606792X|5.0|I thought this book was amazing. By the end of \\"Eclipse\\", I was extremely attached to all of the characters, and I wanted a happy ending for all of them. I wanted Bella to end up with Edward, and I wanted Jacob to imprint on someone else. I also wanted Bella to become a vampire, but somehow remain friends with Jacob. I thought that Stephenie did a great job giving the characters everything they wanted. I thought it was ingenious that she had Jacob imprint on Renesmee, and I didn't find this disturbing because she had already explained imprinting. I also liked that Bella was changed into a vampire because she was about to die. This made it easier for Edward to change her because that was something that he struggled with. I thought that there was going to be a battle at the end, but I was happy with the final messages: Peace is better than an unnecessary war, and protect the ones you love. Yes, it was a very happy ending with no deaths to the characters that I cared about, but I was glad about that. I read \\"The Host\\" so I had an idea about how happy the ending was going to be. These books will be a series that I will recommend and read again!
1416509798|5.0|I had a favorite college professor named Harry R. Sullivan, and this was his favorite book. However I never took \\"Victorian Prose\\" under him, because his class on Trolloppe and Thackeray almost killed me. 30 years later, I attempted to read it, and the old boy was right. It is well-crafted and fast paced..for Victorian prose... I found myself carrying it around to get to the next chapter. A great mystery piece. I am a fan. Here's to you, Dr. Sullivan!
B0017VG69U|4.0|Well, technically I never stopped loving the original Trek, but this remastering has made it so enjoyable to watch. I don't have the first season but will get it soon. Bear in mind I'm watching this on a standard def TV. One thing about 60s TV is how colorful it is, and the remastering makes those colors look amazing. The show could have been shot yesterday. In terms of effects, the most obvious improvement is the Enterprise itself. She looks amazing, very similar to the filming model they used for DS9's Trials and Tribble-ations. It's wonderful to hear the Captain order a \\"hard about\\" or \\"full speed ahead\\" and actually see the ship perform the maneuvers, not to mention seeing other angles of her, since in the original the ship always went left to right on the screen (the filming models cables and controls were on the port (left) side, that's why it was never shown). Also I enjoy seeing the ship orbit different planets, I especially enjoyed seeing her orbiting Earth with the moon behind her in Assignment:Earth. Beautiful shot!  The lion's share of the producer's budget must have gone into \\"The doomsday machine\\" which was not a particular favorite of mine, but is now a delight to watch. In the damaged Constellation, you can see the decks exposed to space, the doomsday machine itself gets redone, and you see the Enterprise doing all sorts of maneuvers, firing her phasers, the shuttlecraft lifting off and leaving the hangar deck. The producers achieved their purpose brilliantly here: the entire episode looks like it would have looked back in the 60s if Gene Roddenberry and co. had had a limitless sfx budget. I think he would have been pleased.  I also enjoyed the little details: in \\"I,Mudd\\" when the android Norman lifts his shirt to show Kirk and Spock the circuitry on his belly, I was surprised to find they had replaced the original with a more modern look.  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the packaging. I don't like the brittle plastic. The DVDs are hard to remove without making the plastic crack. Beautiful design, poorly executed. Also, some effects pretty much look the same, especially the hand phaser shots. Still, this is a great set, and I intend to buy Season One, and Three when available.
0060090383|5.0|Great book - gives an insider viewpoint on addiction and shows the mindset behind the person going through recovery - well done!  This was a long book, but a very good one and I appreciated the attention to detail that Keyes shows on this sensitive topic - I am enjoying the Walsh sisters series very much.
031606792X|4.0|I bought this book despite so many mixed reviews because I had invested so much time and thought into the 3 previous titles.  I was apprehensive when starting Breaking Dawn, but found myself reading the entire thing in the space of one week.  Many of the gripes that people have, particularly with what Bella sacrificed, are unfounded.  I mean, really, is the perpetual victim/martyr role anything new?   Hasn't this been the case for Bella since Twilight?  It's like people haven't been paying attention since the beginning of the series, and now that it's over, they can't believe Bella had to (gasp) make so many sacrifices to get her happily ever after.  This just didn't bother me so much.  If you take the book as a fairy tale/fantasy (come on, it's about werewolves and vampires people), then I think it's best to silence your inner feminist (or just not read the books) and just enjoy.  If you are reading this book and don't have the sense to know that it is, indeed, a fantasy, and not a \\"how to\\" book on life, then you shouldn't be reading it.  And Bella does have her moments in Breaking Dawn...I enjoyed the scene where Bella kicks Emmet's butt in arm wrestling.      My only gripe with this book is that I was a bit confused with some inconsistencies, from what I could tell.  This may just be a lack of my \\"vampire knowledge\\", but I was really perplexed every time Stephenie mentioned \\"breathing\\" as it related to the vampires.  I remember from an earlier book that Edward told Bella that he took breaths just for her benefit, to make himself seem more human, but that it was not necessary for vampires to breath becauase, well, I thought their lungs didn't pump oxygen.  But in Breaking Dawn, breathing is mentioned several times.  When Charlie is coming to see Bella for the first time, they tell her to move her shoulders to make it \\"look\\" like she is breathing.  But then when Charlie is there, she has to take breaths so that she can speak.  Breathing is also mentioned in the book in several other places.  Clearly the vampire sense of smell and hearing is strong, but the breathing thing is leaving me really perplexed.  I'm no doctor, but if breathing is unnecessary for vampires, why do they need to fill their lungs with oxygen in order to speak???  Is it just the heart that stops working properly??? If so, how do the lungs work, since the heart and lungs are kind of a buddy system?  Also, clearly there are other, ahem, parts that work on vampires, hence the conception of \\"Renesmee\\" (also, the name doesn't bother me so much...it is different and odd, but doesn't that fit the plot?).  I would just really like Stephenie or someone who knows about the biology behind \\"vampires\\" to explain this.  I feel that she should have taken MUCH more advantage of Carlisle's expertise within the context of the book, and used it to explain away alot of these questions.  The fact that she DIDN'T leads me to believe that SHE doesn't even know the answers.  Until I get an adequate explanation, I'll still be left scratching my head and will think much less of this series as a whole.  If she is looking to be in the league with some of the best series ever written, the story needs to be much tighter.  All in all, the story is good, but, out of all of the books, this is definitely the most farfetched and the toughest to swallow.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|This is freakin' awesome. I am in love with old t.v. shows and have found that t.v. today just isn't cutting it at all. I haven't watched t.v. in over 3 years but I have always loveed the Star Trek Series and love to watch iot with my girlfriend and mother, and now I have it and I have literally sat down for hours and hours just watching it. I was surprised how fragile the collectors case was, when i got it in the mail it arrived chipped, but the case itself is decent. The DVD's look great and the menus are fantastic! The DVD main menus look like the command center for the Worf's security control panel, very cute.    This is a must buy for all star trek fans!
0452289963|1.0|This is a weird book not worth reading. Oprah is the worst at picking books. I have never read a book from her selections that were not disturbing and bizarre. If you are into disturbing  and bizarre you might like this book. But then again you would like the Celestial Prophecy and other new age books.
0974872407|5.0|If you can read Spanish, this is a must. The plot of the book is simple, yet addictive after the first few pages. One really gets the felling of being in Barcelona at the time.  I could say more, but I wouldn't want to spoil such an captivating book.
0061537934|3.0|If you love dogs, you'll enjoy this book.  It's a good quick read - I read it in one day on my back deck while soaking up the summer sun.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|It's very fun to hear these versions and try to figure out what song a little snippet came from.  This does for the brains of baby boomers what mozart music does for the brains of babies.  If you bought Beatles albums as they were released originally, you will really enjoy these mixes.  I do not want to say more, because the surprises are part of the fun.
B000VKW7AK|5.0|My son loves Megadeth!  He really loves the Megadeth Warchest.  It made his collection almost totally complete!
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great workout that totally gets my heart rate up, my muscles toned & brings my physical abilities to a new level.<br /><br />Level one wasn't too bad except for all the pushups in the first circuit.<br /><br />Level two lasted me a while and I was really proud of myself when I could finish it & not feel completely destroyed. The military press with leg extension & the V-raises were brutal as were the oblique twists & skaters. But it was a success to do them 100% and see my muscle tone come back into view.<br /><br />The only thing I didnt like about levels 1&2 is that all the lunges tended to hurt one of my knees that has given me trouble in the past.<br /><br />Level 3 is definitely a rise above the rest and I've only done it 2 times so far. The strength moves are based less on the weights and more on overall body strength- traveling pushups, jumping lunges (which actually didnt bother my knee as much which surprised me) so it challenges your entire body & is almost like doing cardio even though it's in the strength circuit.<br /><br />My only concern is that after I conquer this 3rd level I will be looking for a new challenge. I do 25 minutes of Taebo beforehand and sometimes do another 25 minute Taebo ab workout afterwards, so I hope that is all enough for me to get in killer shape.<br /><br />It's great to get such a good workout in the house (there is A LOT of jumping so if you have a squeaky floor or live above someone else it could be an issue for you), i'm not a jogger and I'm not interested in buying a cardio machine.<br /><br />My only pet peeve about the video is sometimes Jillian says \\"almost there\\" and it keeps going and going as if she said it at the half-way point, so mentally I'm thinking we're about to change the exercise and we keep going much longer than expected which frustrates me.<br /><br />But for 10 bucks - you cannot beat this workout. I'm totally glad I bought it.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|\\"Lady and the Tramp\\" is my favorite Disney movie.  Who can forget the romantic scene as our hero and heroin share spagetti and they meet nearly nose to nose on a single strand while serenaded ...'a beautiful night'.  This film showcases great characterization, voices, sound and imagery. It's comical and thrilling with the feel good happy ending.  I bought this for myself.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Paul Giamatti does something in this production that surprised me: he gave a performance I enjoyed as someone I would not have enjoyed knowing in life. I am not a huge history buff, so I am not sure of the accuracy of much of this production. However, I did see quite a few things that had me running for the books and wiki to see if they were true. Wonderful sets and cinematography, crazy strong cast, and very realistic feeling sets all work to make this an amazing series. My only sticky point here is that for large sections of the series, you feel as though Adams is only able to speak in angry, long, moving monologues and that the world is a place that had to stop and listen. About the 12th or 13th time, it gets a little hard to sit through again.
B000059T1E|5.0|In the telling, Traffic was this great band with two front-men, Steve Winwood and Dave Mason, which fell apart over egos and ambition and then reformed, without Mason, after Winwood's Blind Faith excursion crashed and burned.<br /><br />In reality, the Winwood-Mason group was really a different band, a fine band, but far less ambitious and innovative than the band that was born on \\"John Barleycorn Must Die.\\"  Losing Dave Mason didn't deplete Traffic; it freed the band from the strictures of its previous incarnation as a generator of hit singles and allowed the fruitful collaboration among Winwood, Chris Wood and Jim Capaldi to reach its full apogee. \\"John Barleycorn\\" doesn't sound anything like the Traffic that did songs like \\"Feelin' Alright\\" or \\"Heaven is in Your Mind.\\"<br /><br />Nor is this version of Traffic -- which continued through the remainder of its career -- a \\"jam band\\" in the sense that those words now signify. The compositions on \\"John Barleycorn...\\" as well as on subsequent classics like \\"The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys\\" are highly structured. Built into that structure were opportunities to perform solos.  Both were multi-instrumentalists, so for some songs that means Winwood soloing on organ, guitar and piano, and Wood on flute and saxophone. Or some combination thereof. Both were virtuosos whose solos had much more to say, musically, than 95 percent of rock instrumentalists.  And you couldn't pin them down.  Their muse pulled them in many directions: Rock, folk, jazz, R&B and various subgenres. What Capaldi provides here and would blossom later into a signature quality was an incredible suppleness of rhythm.  He could lay down a fat groove or a solid 4/4, or he could swing lightly, or he could click away in an ethereal mist.  Whatever the song needed.  Rhythmic adventurousness was Traffic's foundation beginning with this album.<br /><br />The only drawback I find to \\"John Barleycorn...\\" is a wish they had gone further.  Clearly, this group was awaiting an African drummer -- you can almost hear it on some of the tracks.  Of course, that drummer arrived in time for the next Traffic album, \\"Welcome to the Canteen,\\" and is one of the factors in making the next three Traffic albums the unheralded classics that they are.<br /><br />As for the individual songs -- I can't think of a better suite than the three songs that made up the original Side 1 of this disk: \\"Glad, \\"Freedom Rider\\" and \\"Empty Pages.\\"  Then you've got the wondrous title song, which was the centerpiece of side 2.  \\"Stranger to Himself\\" is an R&B style tune, in the mode of the previous incarnation's great final single, \\"Shanghai Noodle Factory/Medicated Goo.\\"  It's just a wonderful slab of music that you'll play a long time before getting tired of it.rummer -- you can almost hear it on some of the tracks.

B0011Z5IVE|2.0|Beware that the MP3 album for sale here is NOT the remastered version, even though it's linked to the remastered CD version on the amazon site.  I discovered this after purchasing and listening to it.  The audio is muddy and full of dropouts, and basically sounds like an old audio cassette.  This is why it's only $8.
0575077174|5.0|I had been in a post Patrick O'Brian slump. Read all his books and was at a  loss where to go to next; he's a hard act to follow. I couldn't get traction with any books I picked up. Somehow I ventured to the SciFi section at the bookstore; hadn't read the genre for years. So I picked up Revelation Space because it had decent reviews on the jacket but I think mostly because it had a cool cover illustration. Eight Reynolds books later, the reality is setting in that I've only got a few pages left with nowhere else to go until his next book. I couldn't wait for this one in the U.S. so ordered from the U.K.   I accidentally discovered what I think is the best SciFi writer out there and House of Suns is an evolutionary step in his expansive ideas while still keeping the DNA thread of House of Reynolds. I love ideas with action and I think the writing genius of Reynolds is that most descriptive narratives are quickly and closely tied to relevant action which creates a force of momentum. Furthermore, his creations sound and feel so right they don't need much, if any, long winded back ground explanations that lead nowhere; the pitfall of many SciFi writers.  House of Suns is not as tight in this regard as say, The Prefect, but it's not meant to be and it all works beautifully with very minor exceptions. (like an elephant who may just blow himself up? This character could have been edited out but I'm happy to give Reynolds some room to add some color and test the waters for future work.)  Alternating first person narrative intrigued me and the ending leaves us with a new launching point to what will hopefully be an intergalactic epic.      Many years ago I left a monastery in India and realized I'd never look at my life or the stars the same.  After reading Alastair Reynolds, you'd be hard pressed to look at your life or the stars the same as well.    Get this book, strap in, and read it.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|This is going to be a long review, because I feel obligated to answer to all those who have left negative reviews and to point out their weakness on the points.<br /><br />The first thing to do, is to concede to the negative reviews, several major points.  This movie is depraved, sickening, horrifying, violent, disgusting, inhumane, disturbing, nightmarish, and violent.  It shows the most despicable images you may ever see.  Cannibal Holocaust has nothing on it.  Saw and Hostel wish they could be as disturbing or violent, but they just aren't.  This movie isn't an enjoyment to watch.  It's interesting.  It doesn't leave you with a good experience.  It leaves you with a sickening feeling in your stomach.  You may want to fastforward through scenes, you may want to fast forward through the whole movie.  This has a lot of horrible scenes.  Everything about the cruelty of this movie is true.<br /><br />Now here's why the Negative reviews are wrong.  Pier Paolo Pasolini wasn't Meir Zarchi (Writer and Director of I Spit On Your Grave) nor was he Ruggero Deodato (director of Cannibal Holocaust).  Pier Paolo Pasolini wasn't a exploitation filmmaker.  His films weren't about zombies or murderers or psychotics or woman getting revenge.  He wrote dramas (Mama Roma, Accatone).  He wrote the story christ (The Gospel of St. Matthews).  And retold many mythology (Odepus Rex, Medea).  He made real films, using realism and other styles of filmmaking to create a reality that showed a world that Italy wanted to deny, a world of pesantry and prostitutes, of gamblers and thugs.  Pier Paolo Pasolini wasn't a filmmaker of shock and exploitation, he was a maker of art films, of dramas.  He was a novelist, a poet, a columnist.  He worked with Bernado Bertolucci, Federico Fellini, some of the greatest foreign filmmakers of his time and of the 20th century.  So Salo shouldn't be seen as a filmmaker deciding to make a splatter porn, or torture porn, like Hostel or Saw, but trying to make a statement, since he did it with his entire body of work.<br /><br />Negative reviews seem to say that this film is wrong.  It's not.  They want to point out how only sick people would watch this film.  But one could say the same thing about The Passion of the Christ.  This is a violent film.  So was the Passion of the Christ.  This is an unpopular stance, how can one--some cocky little person--compare a movie of sadism and violence, with a movie about the Lord and Savior and our redemption, I do so, simply to make a point, that violence is seen in the context in which people know it as.  The Passion of the Christ was to make a point about the suffering of the lord for our sins.  This movie is the horrid nature of fascism and the dangers of globalization (whether you agree with the views of not, the views exist and are on full display).  This movie was a hard movie to watch, just as hard was it to watch The Passion of the Christ, and Apocalyptico, there's not a difference, just a different point.  One was made with the idea of showing you a culture that once existed and a story you all knew, the other used a form of horror that a dying breed witnessed and understood, and put it out there for you to consume and view, to understand the true horrorifying possibilities.<br /><br />Watch it at your own peril.  It's a horrifying movie.  You won't get those images out of your mind for at least a few days.  This movie will effect you.  It will make you think.  I'm not sure if it's worth the money, but it's definitely worth the view.he did it with his entire body of work.     Negative reviews seem to say that this film is wrong.  It's not.

031606792X|5.0|I loved this book, it was page turner. Of course the story didn't go exactly the way everyone wanted, as I see, but this is Stephanies' story not anyone elses. I think that Bella had her baby to fill the gap left by Esmee and Rose who always wanted children. They finally got one in Renesmee. NO I didnt like the name and I didn't like how Jake imprinted on her. I did think the story tied up all loose ends though, and Steph got her pretty red bow on Bella and Edward!!!
B001BGTWXI|2.0|All the hype and waiting for 4 years for great album and this is what we receive. A load of crap.  None of the songs have the old brilliance of wait and bleed or the blister exists.  With Corey's release of two Stone Sour albums, he got carried away and incorporated way too much Stone Sour into Slipknot and it ruined the music.  It's not worth buying this album unless you like Stone Sour or weren't into Slipknot before.  *moment of silence for the old Slipknot*
0783226837|5.0|This film has been around for some time and there are probably quite a number of previous reviews.  I rated the film as 5 stars because of the humor, the quality of the special effects at the time and the chemistry between the characters portrayed by Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward.  As subterranean monsters strike from underground, somehow the responsibility of saving the residents of the small town falls on these two country-boy handymen.  Their attempts to leave the small community for better opportunities elsewhere are thwarted by the activities of the monsters.  The addition of a suvivalist couple, played to the hilt by Michael Gross and Reba McEntire, takes the humor over the top. The battle for survival includes the use of a riding lawnmower, a bulldozer, the survivalist's home made bombs and the concept of \\"stampede.\\"  A very entertaining film, which I watch over and over again.
B00005UW9T|1.0|The DVD I received was damaged.  This two disc set was not complete because the second disk did not play.  I sent it back, and they sent me another one.  I sent it back because the movie did not play.  The second one they sent me was damaged, and it did not play.  I think they just resent the same disk.
0312330537|5.0|One of the few things more amazing than the novel \\"Shantaram\\" is the man who wrote it; Gregory David Roberts.  I watched a video conference with him and much of the book seems to be taken out of real or similar events that happened to him, particularly the major events in the book (prison escape, jailed in India, working with the Indian mafia, etc.)  Leopold's is a real bar in Mumbai as well.  I believe what makes this a \\"novel\\" are the little details; anecdotes, and exaggeration's, alterations of characters.      That said, assuming much of what we read here is based on true events that happened to the man is simply a magnificent story of a fascinating life. Here is a man that has felt the full spectrum of life, flirting with death and danger more than I would ever be capable of doing, and has gained a seemingly profound understanding of himself in the process.      If you are intrigued at all by this book, than it is likely you will enjoy.  There is an upcoming film staring Johnny Depp based on the book.  I don't see how a movie could possibly do it justice, and the film industry's constant efforts to make works of art more palatable for the masses is a constant source of frustration to me.       I highly recommend this book (like many others) and do yourself a favor and read it BEFORE the upcoming film comes out!
0743243153|4.0|I found this book to be a great starter book as I begin the travel of my own towards personal growth.  It's full of psychotherapy, and although I'm not an expert in that field, I found it to be very satisfying and thought provoking.  I would, and have, recommend it to others.
B000002UAO|5.0|Though they continued to tour through 1966, by late 1965 the Fab Four considered themselves primarily studio musicians, and the two great mid-period albums \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\", even in their abbreviated Capitol versions, reflect this.  Gone are the simpler, crowd-pleasing rave-ups that had driven teenaged girls crazy just a short time earlier, replaced by meticulous studio craftsmanship.  In its original Parlophone form (the CD reviewed here), \\"Rubber Soul\\", from December, 1965, contains fourteen originals, ranging from Paul McCartney's cheery \\"Drive My Car\\", to John Lennon's much more complex \\"Norwegian Wood\\" (about a brief tryst, a landmark song in the Beatle canon, as it deals with much more adult subject matter than the group had ever addressed before), to George Harrison's rather sour \\"Think For Yourself\\"; again, far removed from Beatlemania.  Best-known are  McCartney's oft-covered \\"Michelle\\", a signature love song, and Lennon's \\"In My Life\\", which has grown even more poignant since his untimely demise.  The four lads from Liverpool had been the best-known pop group in the world for quite awhile.  Now they settled down to crafting music.
031606792X|5.0|First I have to say that I am an over 30 fan.  Too many OMG moments to count.  A wonderful ending to a great series.  I can't believe its over.  Can't wait for the movie.
B000XA5K48|3.0|It contains OUTRAGEOUSLY UNBELIEVABLE ACTION SCENES. For example in one scene, Clive Owen shot his hand gun continously with a carrot pressed down on the trigger! The shooting is non-stop. It's absolutely nonsense. In my opinion, it's fun to watch once.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|If you love the Alien Movie Franchise you will definitely love all of the fantastic content on this nine disc collection. For the price its a must have.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|This movie is not as funny as the previous ones.<br />Most of the stunts have been done before.<br />Special effects in some scenes look fake. For example, the scene where the ants attack the guy.<br />It has references to aliens at the end. I believe aliens is more suitable in Star Wars.
B00008EY65|5.0|Love this movie. Ron Perlman is great as Hellboy.  Can't wait to buy the second movie in this series.
031606792X|2.0|I ordered the first book in the series to see what all of the hype was about and I was drawn in like so many others.  I am not here to speculate on what effects this book will have on teens as far as marriage, etc. goes, but I am writing to say I was disappointed in the quality of this book compared to the others.  I think letting Jacob go would have been preferable and having him go off to find love and some twists and turns with someone else leaving the possibility for more stories (even if only a possibility).  All of the others left me wanting more and excited for the next.  This one left me ready to move on and a little glum.  I think that there must have been a deadline and much pressure for Stephenie to come up with this final book and frankly, it didn't go well.  But I am still rooting for her and look forward to reading her other books.  And who knows...maybe she will revive the series and redeem it.
0553381687|5.0|Well,<br /><br />This book is not for the casual read. If you like books to be finished on the last page, then the first book in the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series is not for you. However, if you love good stories that seem to end too soon than I encourage you to give this a chance. It's true, the series is not finished yet and you'll be waiting for the last two books but what a journey to that point.<br /><br />I have to admit, I was a skeptic. With so much praise being given, I had put of reading this book for too many years. It did not win me over easily. Oh! But the tangled web it weaves only becomes more captivating with every turn of the page. Yes, it lacks magic (in this book) but remember, this is the forerunner of a much larger story. It sets a stage. That's the goal. Martin excels here in a way that Melville did with \\"Moby Dick\\" and if the comparison sounds far-fetched than hear me out. The characterization is impeccable, but the details are astounding. At points I felt mired in them and cursed them, but the it's dressing for the world-- the frame of this beautiful picture. You wouldn't want it to be different.<br /><br />Something of a technical detail that I think is worth mentioning is that the chapters aren't broken down by theme or plot element, although both are intricately wound within the divisions. Instead, Martin chooses to separate his work by addressing individual characters while much of the action happens in the background in relation to them. I felt that this was a refreshing and welcome twist to a genre that seems hackneyed at times.<br /><br />All in all, this book cannot do without the highest rating. It's too compelling, too well written, and too encompassing to be slighted. It does have faults, but within this magnificent scope and compelling story they are easily overlooked.<br /><br />If you are a fan of fantasy and are reading this then I urge you to try this one book. You will not regret it.
630463949X|5.0|This is a DVD that we will probably wear out. Stunning performance, great sound (although the bass is boosted a little to much). Enjoy this one :)
B000VS6R26|5.0|This is by far the Greatest movie of all time hands down this movie has everything a movie should have the love story is amazing and is also a movie everyone could watch if u dont have this DVD i highly recommend u buy.I personally have all 3 dvd versions of this movie there loaded with very nice extras so if i were u i go for the 3 disc edition..
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Peter Weir is amazing. Utterly and absolutely amazing.<br /><br />In the first 2 or 3 minutes of the movie, the only sound is the ocean. No music. No dialogue. Nothing loud. Simply the gentle susurration of the water. And yet, such an amazing amount of information is conveyed in that short period of time.<br /><br />The opening volley - in the quite literal sense - was shocking. Completely shocking in its violence, its comprehensiveness. Even watching it tonight, for the n-th time, I am jolted from the mild, placid tension to a breathtaking, gut-clenching cringe from the screen. Yes, a feat of CGI; but the actual choice of imagery is the wonder.<br /><br />People can drone on about the `accuracy' or `authenticity' of the visual presentation (sure, I can be one of them). But the more amazing feat is the astonishing amount of the story which is told without words. Either in a simple visual manner, such as the initial minutes of the film, or as a miscellaneous background, a subliminal presentation, such as the dinner with the captain in the middle of the film where he announces the Galapagos Is. as their destination. It isn't the dialogue here, but the simple manner in which the dinner occurs, with singing and drinking and drinking with everyone having a crewman behind his chair, with the absolute absence of any women (there are 2 on screen for about 30 seconds while they're picking up stuff in Brazil).<br /><br />It is the manner in which Weir frames the dialogue, with images and motion, and music which make the film so powerful.<br /><br />I've read all of O'Brien's Aubrey/Maturin novels, and several of his others. (Did you know he wrote Bedknobs and Broomsticks??) When I realized \\"Far Side of the World\\" was being made into a movie, I swore in delight. I then swore in frustration. If I decide to see an adapted screenplay, I avoid reading the book, if possible. It lets me take the film on its own merits. I was only on no. 8; Far Side of the World is no. 10. I had to put off reading the rest of the novels for a year and a half. Argh!<br /><br />Quite a bit is missing; several bits are from other novels in the series. E.g., Ensign Hollum jumps ship with the gunner's wife, whom he's gotten pregnant (she's not in the book). Dr. Maturin does name some huge tortoise after Capt. Aubrey, but it's a few novels earlier when they're somewhere in the Indian Ocean.  Bits & pieces from other parts are in the movie, obviously taking the entire opus as the field from which to pick the best phrases or images.<br /><br />With the whole concept of framing the story, the entire story is on ship, with a brief respite on the Galapagos Is. There is no world outside of the crew. And yet, with such a small, enclosed space, it is presented as just that, a world within itself. This will assuredly remain one of my favorite movies of all time. The judgment of which is whether or not I'll buy the next-generation of video medium (blue-ray HD DVD whatever).<br /><br />The extra disc of \\"extras\\" is amusing and informative.  It's quite long, giving you an opportunity to spend another couple of hours watching it.  It's a pleasant addition to understanding how the movie was made, especially with Wier's discussion.<br /><br />Elizabeth's rating:<br />Definitely go see it on the big screen at full price (if you ever get a chance)r a year and a half.

0380820846|5.0|Absolutely my favorite in the Bridgerton series.  I always wanted Penelope to meet her match, and Colin is the perfect man for her.  Their story is sweet, and the couple is easy to relate to and cheer for (who doesn't want wallflower to finally find love, and to the object of her secret affection to boot).  In addition, the Lady Whistledown mystery is solved in a fun and compelling way.  What more can you ask for?
B001C08RHA|4.0|I'm not from SoCal, so I can't comment on the BK product placement (which was so obvious as to be perhaps intentionally ludicrous?) I would definitely go for In-and-Out waaaay before BK, whether or not I'd been in an Afghani cave for 3 months.<br /><br />I've never read the comic book, and never been that much into them anyway. This is definitely not the semi-plausible superhero (Batman) nor is it the completely implausible (X-Men). That leaves the techno-superheroes: Iron Man. I'm not sure which I find more implausible. But I must admit a buff Robert Downey Jr. is better eye candy than Toby McGuire. That, of course, could easily lead to a super-hero comparison via the eye-candy factor.<br /><br />What seemed a bit lurching was the pace of the beginning and end. The beginning is slow, but not unpleasantly ('get to know the cast of characters and understand the hero's tragic flaws'). But it seemed to be rushing towards the end - fast paced action, sure - but this seemed like someone abruptly realized it was already min.120 and counting, and had to hurry to end it.  Sad, because I was still enjoying it.<br /><br />Downey was spectacular as the nascent superhero, developing the new suit. A childish joy immediately squashed by Newtonian physics. Childish, yet thoroughly amusing consequences (several squashed cars).<br /><br />Script?  ok<br />Direction?  ok<br />FX?  good<br />Robert Downey?  totally makes the movie.  He inhabits the part.  Nothing else is really that spectacular, but you don't notice being so engrossed with him.<br /><br />Elizabeth's rating: 2<br />The special effects are better on the big screen
1569242739|5.0|I was craving cupcakes, and remembered seeing Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World at Whole Foods.  So I ran over there and got the book as well as the ingredients to make the basic vanilla cupcakes, and the vegan cream cheese frosting (lemon variation).  I doubled the amount of lemon zest in the frosting (1 T wasn't enough) - and the cupcakes are unbelievably good.  I just ate two!  Highly recommend this book.  Only problem is deciding what to make next...
0930289234|5.0|This is one of the greatest graphic novels ever written. Alan Moore changed the world of comics with this series. If you haven't read it yet, you should.
0452289963|5.0|I love this book and have also bought the Cd's of this book. I play the Cd's in my car while traveling and they help me to calmly drive in the worst of traffic. Never let your ego get the better of you, and if you fail , just recognize it. I have read the book and listened to the cd's 3 times. If you are ready it will be a real awakening to your life's purpose. I plan to give it as a gift to many friends along the way. Learning to question your ego helps in so many ways. The burden of anger and resentment fall away.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|As usual with most things I love, this film is not for everyone. It is very much an \\"art film\\" and you have to like that sort of thing, but there are a couple of extra elements here that will separate the wheat from the chaff in whether someone else will \\"like\\" this...  Specifically, it's in Japanese (w/English subtitles), most of it is in \\"real time\\", and it helps to understand Japanese concepts of Nature (where living things such as trees have \\"spirits\\" inside them.)<br /><br />Aparently director Akira Kurosawa kept a dream journal, and this film presents 8 such dreams that particularly affected him. Mission accomplished: this film effectively sucked me in and put me in the place of Kurosawa during each vignette. I presume that each segment's ending was when he woke up.<br /><br />There is some powerful stuff here, everything from nightmares to simply surreal episodes straight from his subconscious. Kurosawa bares his soul to the viewer, and the effect is truly moving. One of them (where he's stuck in the mother of all blizzards and the situation is demonstrably hopeless) absolutely crushed me. I freely admit that other segments reduced me to tears. If a film can communicate its effects that accurately and vividly to the viewer, it must be doing something right.<br /><br />Of the 8 dreams, 2 are \\"so so\\" though that's me as a Westerner, and at least I can see why they would have more import to the director. The rest of the film more than makes up for them with their power.<br /><br />In all likelihood, you have never seen anything like this film, so that alone makes it worth checking out. It is certainly worth watching once, and I'd recommend watching it twice so you don't have the anxiety of knowing whether everything works out all right (or not!) hanging over your head.
B000060MMI|5.0|When my son was born, we tried everything to make him stop crying. Everything. He had colic for four months, cried 9 hours a day, and the ONLY thing that would put him to sleep, was this CD. Don't ask me why, it's not the calmest music out there, but from the first few picks and drum beats in \\"Drunken Lullabies\\", he would stop crying and fall asleep within the first couple songs.<br />He's now 18 months old, and adjusting to sleeping in a toddler bed, which is really hard. My husband got all sorts of clever yesterday and popped this CD in his CD player, and guess what? Still works like a charm. He's out cold in under 10 minutes.

031606792X|5.0|I enjoyed the Twilight series for exactly what they are: a fun work of FICTION. Meyer weaves a good story, and while I do have to admit that the fourth book does wrap up every problem a bit too nicely, it was still fun. Some people are getting a little carried away with their criticisms of it.
B001B71NOI|5.0|If you have listened to Nine Inch Nails in the past, well, you should listen now more. Trent has assaulted his own standards of music with an even fresher sound and an more aggressive talent. Whether its the blood pumping track 1,000,000 or the politically charged Letting you, or the thumping beat of Discipline - you'll be happy you purchased the album.<br /><br />All of the talent on this album are in his concerts, and after having pit tickets to his August 2008 Dallas show I can say without a doubt they are skilled. Live, on album, or in video on this disc - you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />If you love electronic music, hard rock, or Nine Inch Nails - you should get this album in THIS edition. If you love to hear something great, and new, and something cutting edge - get THIS edition.<br /><br />The video disc makes it a great deal alone!
031606792X|5.0|Why all the negative reviews? I read the entire series over this past week, and I loved it! I immediately became entranced in the unlikely romance of Bella and Edward. The final book is just as amazing as the other three, and everything I hoped would happen for Bella came true. Why is everyone complaining...don't we still enjoy happy endings? Or is it because people think happy endings don't often happen in real life? I think that's just cynical. Besides, it is fantasy, not reality. People need to stop being so serious about the morals and messages portrayed in the book..it is just a story! And those of you who want a good message...Bella and Edward didn't have sex until they were married, so there you go! And what does any of it have to do with age? They are immortal for goodness sake, so age means nothing. Bella could still go to college a hundred thousand times if she wanted...would we really have wanted to read about her waiting to get married to get her degree? What kind of novel would that have been? Come on! That's absurd. The entire series was captivating and satisfying. And it was one that I absolutely enjoyed and would recommend to anyone young or old.
055358894X|5.0|Lies of Locke Lamora<br /><br />Without question, one of the best books I've read this year and probably the best book in the genre I've read since I finished the last George R. R. Martin Song of Ice and Fire book. I finished it a few days ago and I'm still excited about it!<br /><br />Lies, by new author Scott Lynch, follows the exploits of Locke Lamora, an orphan who is raised to be a thief. The setting is Camorr, a Venice-like city that has a rather significant crime problem, mostly made up of little gangs of orphaned thieves and controlled by a mafia-like crime boss. Lamora is the ultimate anti-hero, charming and funny but also a little despicable. He is trained in the art of deception by a false priest named Chains, along with his adopted brothers Galo, Caldo, Jean and Bug. The book switches back and forth between when Locke and his \\"brothers\\" are young and being trained by Chains, to the present day when Locke is the new \\"garrista\\" (leader) of their gang, called The Gentlemen Bastards, now that Chains has passed away. Although the Gentlemen are thought to be just a bunch of low-producing sneak thieves to the rest of the crime gangs and the boss, they really spend their day breaching \\"The Secret Peace\\"--a deal struck between the ruling class of Camorr and the crime boss that his thieves would stick to robbing the commoners and merchants and leave the upper class alone, and in exchange the police would \\"miss\\" a lot of the crime going on right under their noses. Lamora and his gang purposely target the upper class, even though they have no idea how to even spend their secret fortune, just to prove they can get away with it.  The trouble begins when a man calling himself The Gray King starts targeting the gangs, and Lamora in particular.<br /><br />I read some of the negative reviews of this book, and most seem to take umbrage with the extensive use of foul language. Yes, if cursing inherently offends you, this book is not for you. It's about a bunch of people raised from childhood to be criminals, so to me the cursing is pretty natural. I also saw a criticism that the wittiness of the dialogue was distracting and unrealistic--that characters in mortal danger should not be ready with a pithy, thoughtful comment. Ok, fair, but honestly, the dialogue in this book is so masterfully entertaining that I can forgive the fact that it's just a little bit too good to be real. I mean, it's not a book that is trying to portray any sort of realism, so I think a bit of overly witty commentary is ok.<br /><br />To any fan of the genre, this is surely a can't-miss read. I'm about 100 pages into Lynch's second in the series and already lamenting that the third isn't out yet.be criminals, so to me the cursing is pretty natural.
