0811870413|5.0|I started about a month ago trying to bake Sourdough.  However, it was going very badly.  I got all kinds of results trying all kinds of recipes but none of them worked.  Following the instructions here for \\"basic bread\\" was the first time I was completely successful in getting the taste and look of a proper Sourdough.  The instructions are detailed, in the extreme, but detailed instructions are what is really needed.  Sourdough uses natural yeast and managing it is complicated.  If you want \\"simple\\" then use commercial baker's yeast -- the complications of using natural yeast are why baker's yeast was developed.  The recipe does not use kneading to develop the dough.  Rather, it uses time and folding of the dough to develop the dough.  But, using this method resulted in the first time I was able to \\"pull a window\\" with the dough.  And it was not itty-bitty window but a huge one.  I never got results like that no matter what I did with kneading.  Plus, it's a lot less wear & tear on the arms and back.  The use of the cast-iron covered pan for baking delivers a clearly superior product.  Plus, you don't have to keep opening the oven to spray trying to keep the steam going.  Yes, you're dealing with a hot oven and very hot implements.  However, if you don't like heat, then you shouldn't be baking anything.  The book also contains more than the basic bread recipe and variations.  It also has salad recipes.  In case you're in the school of salad making that consists of throwing some lettuce in a bowl and throwing some dressing on top, you'll find out how really good salad can be.  Sitting down to a meal of bread and salad from this book would be a delight.  So, if you're a frustrated Sourdough baker, this book marks the end of your nightmare.  It's also FUN to do.  You can't beat it when it's really fun to create such a great product with your own labor.
B000VNMMQ6|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the series, so I'm a little biased when it comes to reviewing the movie.  Then again, if you are on this page reading reviews, you probably like the series as well.  I'd highly recommend this one if you haven't seen it because it's very similar to the others.  A ton of action and little acting :)
1599218011|2.0|Did not learn anything new, and the language was ridiculous (I guess the author was trying to get through our skulls with exclamation points and expletives). I usually look for recipes, and there were few to be had.
B003L77G06|5.0|I ordered Modern Family Season 2 from them.  I ordered late Saturday night and I received it in the mail on Wednesday morning.  It was in perfect condition, reasonably priced, and arrived very quickly.  I was very pleased with the transaction and would definitely order from here again.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|in the last round of updates on my android amazon removed the feature allowing me to load my own books into the app via the sdcard. now the only way to get them in is to have a &quot;send-to-kindle&quot; email address wich u can ONLY get if u own a kindle (wich i dont). a very poor decision wich makes this app worthless to me. Installed nook and converted my books to epub with calibre. Apparantly Barnes &amp; Noble want people to use their app. nook color looking more appealing than a kindle right now. /sigh..... i really liked the kindle app to. sad day for me
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This is an exceptionally well made product. Durable quality. Although it is sold as a stroller accessory, I purchased it to use on my TiLite wheelchair. Couldn't work better if it had been custom designed. Hanging from the frame below the seat and behind my knees, this caddy holds a water bottle, eyeglasses, cellphone, medication, gloves, and tissues all within easy reach. The wire frame sewn into the fabric keeps the same shape whether empty or full, allowing for good visibility and easy access without having to fumble around inside a pouch or bag. Excellent product.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|What a gripping story. This triligoy has been a wonderful read and its sad to see it end. Sanderson is a great long term planner with his story lines and it never fails to flow wonderfully and draws you in. Characters are well written and diverse and very likeable. The ending is amazing and was quite unexpected. I would say this is a must read for fantasy fans.
1573223085|5.0|It arrived earlier than expected in better condition than I expected. Very happy with the purchase. I would purchase from this vendor again.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This is a realy good debut CD from Scotty.  All of the songs are real country.  I watched and voted for him every week on Idol and really hoped he would win, because he is the best singer Idol has had in years.  I have been a diehard country music fan since I was a kid and Scotty is the real thing for a 17 year old.  He does the up-tempo and slow realy great and I am a fan and always will be 100%.  Thanks Scotty for bringing back real country music.
B004EPZ00M|5.0|Johnny English has been 5 years in retirement in Tibet learning the ways of the master. He is called out of retirement for a mission to China to hunt down \\"Vortex\\" an assassination group out to kill the Chinese premier. There are 3 keys, or key parts that must be gathered together to have access to a secret weapon.<br /><br />The first good joke was the \\"Toshiba\\" sponsor sign for MI-7 secret services. The humor is more than just slapstick. Rowan Atkinson combines the sophistication and intellect of James Bond with the zaniness of Peter Sellers. Indeed, for those who loved Peter Sellers would also enjoy Atkinson who doesn't attempt to copy Sellers, but rather create a character in his own style reminiscent of the master. The early scene with the cat had me laughing out loud at the classic style of Atkinson.<br /><br />English is aided by agent Tucker (Daniel Kaluuya), a sidekick that has his own failings. Excellent use of the sound track. Worth seeing. Simply hilarious.<br /><br />Good family movie for the older kids. Imagine a good comedy without all that crude humor (okay it has some kicks to the groin). No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.
0451529308|5.0|My mom encouraged me to read this story when I was 11. It was a bit too mature for me then, but I enjoyed it so much at 13. I identified with both Jo and Beth. I noticed Jo's literary bent and Beth's inherent shyness in myself.   My British mom owned two volumes of Alcott's story--Little Women and Little Wives (sometimes known as Good Wives). Little Wives or Good Wives is simply Little Women, Part II in the U.S. As a young girl, I preferred the story of the girls before they married. As I grew older, I appreciated Part II or Little Wives so much more.   I didn't often re-read the entire books. I had my favorite chapters. I just loved the chapter--Experiments--when Marmee permits the girls to enjoy the first week of their summer vacation with no household chores. It ends with them all thoroughly fed up with their life of leisure. Jo especially feels the need for work and gives a dinner party with disastrous results.   Another favorite chapter of mine was when Meg goes to \\"Vanity Fair,\\" a weekend of frivolity at her wealthy friend's home ending in a ball where the rich girls lend her a gown to replace her old torn one. With the help of makeup and frills, they make her into someone quite different, taking away from some of the freshness and innocence she still possessed at 17. This is the night when she overhears a couple of old biddies talking about how good it would be for the March family if Meg could manage to marry the wealthy Laurence boy (Laurie). They were convinced that Mrs. March had her plans for the two.   But Alcott made it very clear that Marmee was quite a different sort of mother--she wanted nothing but happiness and love for her daughters, and she didn't believe that a great deal of money was necessary in order to be happy.   The moral lessons in this book abound. The sickness and death of Beth are looked upon as life experiences more than terrible tragedies, and death is seen as a beginning to a new life. Beth talks about how she'll miss Jo even in \\"heaven,\\" and Jo says after Beth's passing, \\"We must thank God that Beth is well at last.\\"  Meg thumbs her nose at cranky, wealthy Aunt March when the older woman says that should Meg marry her financially-strapped suitor, John Brooke, that she'll inherit none of her money. She lets her know in no uncertain terms that love means far more to her than money.   Jo gives up writing her \\"potboilers\\"--the violent, mawkish thrillers that her German professor friend hates and instead pens a touching story about her sister, Beth, and wins his approval and a marriage proposal. She has already turned down Laurie's proposal because she realizes that although she loves her \\"boy\\" as a friend that she needs something different in a husband.   So there are many lessons, but I never felt as a child that I was reading a book of sermons. I felt as though I were reading about real people and I learned to care about them. I loved all of it--the fashion talk--the way Meg and Amy cared so much about style and how Jo would carry a lemonade-stained glove crumpled up in her hand and wear a gown that had fireplace burns on the back of the skirt and just laugh and enjoy herself.   I read all the Alcott books to my daughter when she was ten. When I read the final words of Jo's Boys, \\"Let the curtain fall forever on the March family,\\" the tears rolled down her face. I remember just a while after I had given birth to my daughter thinking, \\"Oh, wonderful, I'm going to share Little Women with her--what a joy!\\"
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app would be great if amazon would release the update for it. The Android market has the update available but not amazon. Without the update you can only connect to machines on your LAN. The update allows you to connect remotely of over Internet or 3g.  Will be 5 stars once they provide the update.

B004DTLK8A|5.0|Fantastic new album by Stratovarius, going back to their prime sound - and then some. This album will NOT disappoint!
B00418NVMQ|5.0|This band has it all: great musical chops, and perhaps the finest female vocalist going in this genre of band today. Lzzy sounds like a reincarnation of Janis Joplin crossed with the still VERY alive Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde, while still easily carving out her own territory. The band, too has amazing skills for such a relatively young group, and the songwriting is top notch. A great cd/dvd set at a great price from this seller...........
B003R69N20|3.0|Not a bad cover -   I just want the phone to have MORE protection.    I ended up buying an OTTER.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|I think this video deserves a higher rating than the average shown. George Lonegan (Matt Damon) can do no wrong in my eyes and directed by Clint Eastwood (who also wrote the musical scores), and with Spielburg as the excutive director,  made the near Sci-Fi thriller experience come off smoothly.  I have watched this twice tonight and enjoyed the second time more than the first. The story is sound and the near death experience was treated logically and not over done. Matt Damon's clairvoyance and ability to read peoples minds, by just a touch, was also treated well and added depth to the story line. So with the story, acting, directing and presentation makes this video a winner in my mind.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I have never before been touched to tears by a book like this book has touched my heart.  Simply brilliant writing. Characters are well developed.  I could not put it down.  Amazing story of human survival.

B000W00Y0Y|5.0|When I first saw [[ASIN:B002P8O29K Gimme Shelter]], I knew no other concert film could be better. The circumstances, the performance, the music, and the cinematography conspired to create a work of art that cannot ever be topped. If Gimme Shelter was 5/5, everything else would be less. And sure enough, everything else was less. A few 1/5, many 2/5, and an occasional 3/5. As I waded through these many bad to mediocre concert films, a thought formed in my brain, \\"Once you've seen the best, what's the point of seeing anything more?\\"  And so I gradually stopped watching concert films. Until this week when my wife insisted on seeing a movie of Queen in concert. It was this one or [[ASIN:B005EVVPUE Queen Live at Wembley]]. Being a high def addict, I voted for this and boy am I glad I did. The performance is electrifying. The music is better than the studio recordings. The cinematography is truly outstanding by every technical, artistic, and editorial measure. The blu ray transfer is excellent. I've always enjoyed Queen, but this concert footage gave me a new deeper appreciation for their talents and most especially for Freddy Mercury, consummate musician and performer. At the end of the concert, I cried that Freddy Mercury is no longer with us. No, it's not as good as Gimme Shelter, but it is outstanding on its own merits and richly deserves a 5/5.
B005POK858|1.0|It has horrible buggy slow control's there are no angle in the control like 1st game just left right up down the battle are random and unavoidable before in the 1st game you could see the monster and run past them in this  you just appear in battle's without a monster present the music isn't as good the price tag is to much the monster have improvement graphically the story line is non sense in all reality the game should be 99 cent's.

0802473156|5.0|Insightful, easy-to-read, and powerful, The Five Love Languages takes a simple, but profound look at love in marriage. Whether your marriage is thriving, struggling, or seemingly dead, this book offers a unique outlook into expressing love to match your spouse's emotional needs.  The Five Love Languages shows that love is possible after the in-love phase.  As Dr. Gary Chapman illustrates, love is a choice, often difficult, but possible.  A linguist myself, Dr. Chapman's approach to expressions of love as \\"languages\\" made his points easy to understand.  I also could recall in my own experiences events where heartfelt expressions of love were not appreciated for what they were.  How a costly gift, a tender hug, or some act of kindness was just insufficient. Now that I have read Dr. Chapman's work, I realize that it was because I was speaking the wrong love language in each instance; I was not matching another person's mode of receiving love.  Others' attempts at demonstrating their affection for me have also become plain.  Actions I thought insignificant or even hostile I have now realized to have been meant to show me love.  The Five Love Languages is really more than just for couples--it is a handbook for all relationships.  Disclosure of Material Connection:   I received this book free from Moody Publishers as part of their Blogger Review Program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My 2 kids LOVE this movie and the book.  The movie is the perfect length for a little evening tv (about a 1/2 hour). You can tell the producers really sat down with the book on this one. They added a lot of visuals and padded the story, but mostly with images that they pulled from the book, but a few bonus sequences thrown in. They were very careful to keep the original rhyme of the book in place which is clever and touching.   Magical. We love all it. + for the price! totally worth it!
B002N8A14M|4.0|I'm very happy with this product! I love the multi-functionality, and I don't need to take the case off my i-pod at all. You just need to clip it of the band and its ready to be attached to your coat or jeans. Its clear and simple, and protects my nano very well. The only \\"bad\\" thing about it is when it rains (if you like running in the rain as I do): the case has the hole on top and the water gets inside... But I found a good solution for that too... Just roll the band so the case is at the other side of your arm. Apart from the \\"water-proof issue\\" I would recommend it to everyone! The price is great too!
B0007RT9LM|5.0|My DVD arrived right on time in great condition!  I now go to Amazon first when I am looking for anything!
B005EXA8LY|5.0|What can I say?  Wow.  Perhaps the most mind-altering sonic cavern of gems I've ever entered.  Ok, so that's a bit out there, but seriously.  Raider II is the veritable centerpiece to the album. As you begin to drown in this record's sprawling dark beauty, you recognize subtle themes from earlier tracks mingling in a sublime sort of harmony throughout this monumental piece.  It's not a \\"oh, let's hear that one again\\" sort of album--even better, it's an \\"oh, let's hear what follows\\" sort of album.  Reviewing this is tricky...if you try to form static opinions, especially in writing, regarding Wilson's work after only a handful of listen-through's, you'll end up regretting it. This is because his work, as art, is so organic as to grow on you for a very long time; and I think 'Grace for Drowning' (after months, years, of listening) will exemplify this as much as any other Wilson project, and probably more so. I'm amazed he produced this so quickly. Again, wow.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Simply put it is Final Fantasy like SNES.  Nice story, very good 2D Graphic, good music.  Awesome gameplay.  Side story after complete the main.  Easily 30hours on this game.
B0058A119G|5.0|As an unabashed Barbara Streisand fan, I really enjoy this album. She always does the Bergmans proud with her interpretations of their lyrics. The bonus CD contains some of my all time favorites, while the first CD has some less familiar, but beautiful songs. At his stage of her career she could be just sitting back, relaxing, but she continues to treat her fans with new releases. Thanks Barbara!
1439192812|4.0|The best way of thinking about this books is as an analogy to Hawking's \\"Universe in a Nutshell\\" - with a focus on general science  It is a series of well written vignettes illustrating the wonder of our reality as linked with common observations and questions arising from our real world. In most cases it begins with mythical explanations, followed by a clear, nicely written and illustrated explanations of truth - as best we know it and as revealed by science. The chapters are  1) What is reality? what is magic  2) Who was the first person  3) Why are there so many different kinds of animals  4) What are things made of  5) Why do we have night and day, winter and summer ?  6) What is the sun ?  7) What is a rainbow ?  8) When and how did everything begin ?  9) Are we alone ?  10) What is an earthquake  11) Why do bad things happen ?  12) What is a miracle ?  It is written for older children. The unfortunate reality is that most adults don't know the answers to most, and certainly not all, of these questions either. The result is a bit of a disconnect. The writing style is often as if he was verbally explaining something to a younger child of perhaps 10 or 12 - as he discusses a topic or phenomena of which most adults are sadly ignorant. The result is a text from which most all can benefit - but is not perfectly smooth for many readers.  That quibble aside, this text should be purchased by most everyone. I have the copy on ipad also, and have found the combination very pleasant. The ipad version has added vibrancy and has wonderfully interactive games which have taught my children about stable orbits from Newton's cannon and demonstrated how selection results in adaption among frogs, with the differential effects as they relate to predation. These are only a few examples among many, and I wish I had this book when I was younger. This book wonderfully demonstrates and illustrates the magic of reality, and proves that the rainbows beauty is only enhanced with understanding.  Buy it. Buy two copies and gift it to a local library or school. In so doing, you'll make the world a better place.
B0006J28L4|5.0|I cannot believe how well this film holds up--I just saw it for the first time a few weeks ago and it's just as compelling, moving, vivid, and spot on as you can imagine.  I didn't feel like it was long or dragged at all--it is magnificent the way it evokes chapters from Malcolm's life, from his criminal past to the streets of Harlem to the pyramids of Egypt.  It was beautifully filmed and brilliantly acted by Denzel Washington and it is a crime that he did not win an Oscar and Al Pacino did!  Yes, Pacino is a compelling actor and talented but his acting in \\"scent of a woman\\" in no way approaches the amazing tour de force performance of a lifetime done by Mr. Washington here--I honestly think it is one of the most spectacular performances of all time.  And there really is only one explanation for why he didn't win.  Spike Lee of course deserves the most accolades for being the visionary behind this movie, this project, this filming.  Watch this movie today!  You will not be bored; you will be moved and inspired.  \\"I am Malcolm X!\\"
B004LUS390|5.0|This is an excellent drawing application for artist of any skill level. I was able to create some solid works with very little trouble. It did take a moment to adjust to using my finger to draw but it soon becomes natural. This app has a wide range of features that make the price more than worth it. Definitely a buy.
0618526412|5.0|I first heard about this book after reading that Richard Wright (one of my favorite writers) had liked this book, and I read it and was just in love with it and its author.  It is such a simple story in some ways, but so beautiful and wise.  It illustrates so many truths about human nature, the ways we look for companionship and validation from others.  It is one of my favorites.
B005KWL2IW|4.0|This a review for the idiots.  Members of anthrax were in crappy bands like S.O.D, Armored Saint, Nuclear Assault.  On to Worship the production is great, belladonna's vox are perfectly restrained.  I don't know all the history behind the writing and recording but the songs do not sound forced.  The songs have a strong mix of melody with your classic anthrax breakdown.  This album is a big step up from \\"theyve come from us all\\"(I think is the worst album).  And you get to see AnThrax with Joey!
B004SB60OC|5.0|I love this cd.  Christina sings such heartfelt songs and she has an incredible voice.  I would definately buy more of her music and would recommend it highly.
B0027DK206|5.0|I love my instant back. It's not perfect but that's exactly what I wanted. If you want perfect instant photos, buy an instax mini. The instant back definitely takes some practice to get it right but when you do it's so worth it.<br />I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in experimenting.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Very fun and addictive game. Nice graphics and quick to load. Highly reccomend downloading this game. Probably the next Angry Birds.
1439192812|5.0|I haven't read this book yet, so I'll come back and edit this review once I have.  However, I did watch the little video about it, and in it, Richard mentions that there is an IPad app.  I got excited, hoping/thinking that there would also be a IPhone app.  I was disappointed.  The app is for the IPad only.  This book, and others like it, are screaming for an Iphone app.  There are a bajillion books/apps for kids on the iphone that attempt to indoctrinate kids into religion.  Heck, even the Berenstein Bears have gone religious now.  My son loves space and science and books for kids that revolve around those topics are hard to find.  I think this kind of book would do well on the Iphone too.  Even if it had to be shortened and modified to fit.
B005PKLKS6|5.0|My goodness. It's like everything that slowly been coalescing this season is coming to a full throttled roar of suspense. Just a great great TV program, and this episode is one of it's best.   This is one of the best ensembles I've ever seen. Giancarlo Espisoto continues to amaze, as does Bryan Cranston, and the whole cast. Hank, Saul Goodman, Pinkman etc..etc...
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love Angry Birds and didn't think I'd like this but I was wrong! I took a chance and got addicted to this game on my iTouch. Purchased it for my Android phone and it's my go-to game. Great graphics, fun and does get challenging as you make progress. I've even reset and replayed it. I hope the &quot;experiments&quot; and &quot;holiday&quot; version gets released for Android soon. Well worth a buck! The only thing you'll complain about is wanting updates faster.
B0054SMIH6|3.0|Not very credible and not always easy to follow but reasonably well-acted. It held our interest and, afterwards, we felt satisfactorily entertained.   Reminiscent of a toned-down Bourne film and/or \\"Unknown\\" without the extreme mayhem, intrigue and special effects. As in those films, you won't always understand what is said or follow what's going on or believe that much of what transpires is actually possible in real life. But, who cares? There's sufficient plot, tenseness and action to satisfy a casual viewer who is looking to sit back and be entertained.
0823004325|5.0|This is a marvelous book for anyone who wants to draw or paint faces.  The illustrations are detailed and expressions are explained fully.  I am delighted to have this book in my studio and would recommend it for any artist.
B003OFHMKO|5.0|Just seen her in concert to start her fall tour at the Orphieum and then listen to this CD. Word's cannot describe how wonderful she and her band are. She played most of this CD at her show and then to hear the CD, I was blown away! To hear the CD \\"come to life\\" at the concert then to hear the CD seemed like I was there again. Her fusion of classical music and jazz may rub some the wrong way but I'm interested to hear what her next CD will sound like. Jazz should stop shunning her and accept this talent.
0385534639|2.0|The descriptions were great, but the story was not very well developed. The love story ends with little fanfare and the circus is taken over by someone who likes it?
B004SBX112|2.0|I am at a loss for words. Angry Birds Seasons (Ad-Free) now has full screen ads. I'd like to write something to express my disappointment but Rovio obviously doesn't care. I just hope the consumers show their displeasure with their wallets, and stop supporting this bait-and-switch money grab.
1400052181|3.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is a book whose content is riveting but whose delivery is, ironically, \\"lacking\\" (Lacks-ing?). Skloot deserves credit for doing what no one before her successfully had: creating a cohesive narrative spanning the decades from Henrietta's birth until the present, weaving in plot lines from the scientific and medical communities with more intimate stories about Lacks' family and even about the author's own internal processes. The book begins with titillating stories about Henrietta's childhood and what events transpired to lead her down the path to unwittingly surrendering HeLa cells to Johns Hopkins, and continues by discussing the story of HeLa cells' evolution both literally (genetically) and as a research phenomenon. She does a good job of simplifying potentially overwhelming material for readers of varied scientific backgrounds while still keeping things interesting enough for medical anthropology buffs.   As many other reviewers in the 1-3 star range have noted, it is at this point that the book's quality begins to decline. To be sure, this is in part due to the abrupt shift in content, as the book becomes a familial biography after 150 pages of medical non-fiction. But my personal discomfort reading the latter half of the book grew chiefly out of Skloot's infantilization of the Lacks children (Henrietta's four living children at the time of the book's writing). Skloot issues a caveat early on, which is that errors in grammar/syntax of the dialogue in the book are preserved in order to lend authenticity to the voices of those being interviewed. At first, this made sense to me. There are certainly noticeable differences in speech between north and south, educated and non-educated, rich and poor, and from culture to culture, and all these come to light in The Immortal Life's cataloguing of quotations from the family members. I even appreciated that she had made efforts not to correct the Lacks' manner of speaking, as this wouldonly repeat the disrespects done to them in previous decades, ones it seemed Skloot was hoping to rectify or at least counter with her earnest portrayal of the story.  But I began to feel, after a certain amount of pages of dialogue, as if her sprinkling of broken phrases and malaprops had become gratuitous. It was as if she were beating the reader over the head with a mallet, pounding in, \\"these people are so poor and messed up they can barely speak English!\\" A more seasoned reporter with a more sensitive approach might not have felt so compelled. I struggled with the possibility that perhaps, had Skloot *not* constantly relied upon dialogue to make her point, that I wouldn't have understood the utter poverty and destitution of the Lacks. But I believe that descriptions would have better served her purposes, and would have paid more respect not only to the subjects but the reader too -- Skloot should have substituted her weak dialogue with better-written prose paraphrasing conversations, with occasional examples.  Additionally, Skloot depicts herself as the translator between the Lacks and the greater world. She is apparently the one to first explain the meaning of the term \\"cell,\\" she is the first white person to come into their world as a benevolent force. In her effort to honestly insert her own experience into the writing, Skloot ends up idealizing herself as \\"Miss Rebecca\\" without disclosing the irony of these interactions. She describes how Deborah, Lacks' daughter, excitedly dresses all in black so as to resemble Skloot's look for their reporting adventures. She describes how one of the Lacks men cooks her a charred and fat-laden pork chop and trumpets the fact that she ate it to be polite. I believe that I would have felt more comfortable with Skloot's second half of the book if she had admitted and explored her own significance as another white researcher barreling into Clover, VA for self-serving purposes. Her beat-around-the-bush style is frustrating, and makes this reader wish that someone more direct like Joan Didion had edited the book for succinctness. Oh well.  If you are interested in HeLa and its origins, read the book. Just keep your expectations low and consider skimming the last part of the book. As a final thought, I might add to that the reason I give Skloot 3 stars is because I think the book's writing quality is rather fair (so, 2 stars) but her reporting efforts and her willingness to tread on thin ice for many years around the Lacks family are commendable. And also, she has managed to air some dirty laundry that many would not have read about, had the book been marketed too much as a scientific or medical read.

0307887898|4.0|You should seriously consider reading this book if you're planning to launch products. It's very useful for both startups and established businesses.  However, it repeats itself a number of times and sometimes it takes 3-4 pages to describe concepts which could be written in half page.  It should also have more concrete recommendations on how to apply lean principles.

0143034901|5.0|Too many books I've read recently left me hungry for a really good read -- the kind of read that grabs you from the start and keeps you entertained and involved until the very end.  Last week I read The Shadow of the Wind and it was like sitting down to a very satisfying literary meal that was delicious from beginning to end.  The setting is Barcelona in 1945 with a young boy and the author of a book he reads whose lives mirror each other and whose stories become intertwined.  Enter mystery, romance, friendships that take turns for the better and the worse, the divine and the twisted love of parents, gothic settings and an often page-turning pace of events.  I'm not sure that I fully agree with some of the comparisons to what I consider literary masterpieces but it is a read that won't disappoint.  Best read when you have time to become completely absorbed because you won't want to put this one down until you get to the last page!
B0041KKYCY|4.0|This movie was fairly entertaining, but really not all that interesting.  For me it started out very slow.  I never saw the original, but when the girl is alone in the cabin, you know something is going to happen... but youre waiting and waiting.  It developed a little slowly.  Finally it happens, the intruders come and she is assaulted.  Then she comes back in revenge and kills them one at a time.  The movie is pretty brutal, but there was one part specifially that I could not watch.  I'll just say it involved teeth, being removed from someones mouth.  And maybe its wrong to say this, but I am not sure those guys deserved what they got.  Dont get me wrong, they assaulted her and raped her, which was not nice.  But she tortured and killed each one of them.  Anyway, it was okay to watch one time, but probably not a movie with much replay value.  If youve seen it once, its probably enough.  And just slightly on the edge of being boring at times.

0670022950|5.0|Steve Pinker is an joy to read.  Few writers have his in-your-face intellectual confidence to invite your skepticism by telling you in the introduction that he intends to make a sweepingly radical point, then list in advance the evidence he will present to convince you.  Not only does his thesis defy conventional wisdom and the most common intuitions from the evening news, his conclusions carry enough moral charge to provoke howls of protest from a wide range of people with a vested vision of a radically different human history and our future.  Plus, he has the writer's chops to make these points with a breathtaking eloquence, brevity and a rock-solid erudition.<br /><br />He has done this successfully before.  His 2002 book, The [[ASIN:0142003344 The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature]], in similarly demolished the \\"tabula rasa\\" model of human nature which had increasingly dominated all the social sciences throughout the 20th century.  Like \\"Our Better Angels...\\" his logic was an irresistible force and the prose was electric with the ring of truth and studded with insights of wisdom lightly often disguised as pearls of wit.  My obsolete view of human nature (acquired by osmosis) was swept away in the opening chapters I found myself amazed that a writer who makes important points so quickly and convincingly could sustain such a chain for 500-plus pages.<br /><br />If this book were thinner I'd have read it in a single sitting, and though I haven't yet finished it, I've jumped impulsively ahead at random a dozen times and found myself hooked for pages every time before returning to the bookmark.  This book is just over 800 pages and is, if anything, even better.  It may raise less ruckus than the \\"Blank Slate\\" (there's no towering academic attachment to human violence comparable to its commitment to tabula rasa humanity) but there's a very good reason to read this book: it's the sort that can do more than just change your mind, the sort of book that makes reading into more than another learning experience.  It's fun.than another learning experience.  It's fun.
1565117808|4.0|My biggest complaint is that there is no list anywhere on the packaging/casing or CDs that identifies which chapters can be found on which disc. As a teacher, it's rough when I want to let my students listen to a chapter and can't turn to it quickly.  I'd also criticize the lack of drama in the reading - it's rather flat - just sayin'.

B004M9AS3Y|4.0|This bag is amazing!  I researched all different kinds of bags that could carry my DSLR + Lenses + Misc. Items + 15\\" Macbook Pro, and this is the one.   All the other bags offer great attributes, but this one definitely takes the cake; it has a great easy access camera slot for my Canon 550D + Battery Grip + Vivitar 28mm 2.8, and definitely has room for a lot more.   This also holds my 15\\" Macbook Pro, with all of my cords and accessories (headphones, external hdd). The ONLY qualm I've had thus far is that I can't fit my laptop and my sleeve very comfortably into the laptop compartment-- but it helps that the bag is extremely padded.   The build quality of the bag is also extremely nice, with a solid feel and overall great look. The bag is extremely inconspicuous, so there really is no need to worry about people KNOWING you have a camera and a laptop on you.   What's also nice about this bag is that if you don't need to carry your camera, you can essentially get rid of the camera slot, allowing for books and clothing to take its place. Even with the camera slot, there's tons of room for other items.   The front pockets are seriously spacious, and I can hold all of my cords, miscellaneous documents, extra lenses, clothing, and books inside of it. The slots for a cellphone and pens holds my clunky Android G1, along with a bunch of pens and thumb drives.   The water bottle mesh knit on the side is super convenient, holding my Klean Kanteen and even my cell phone.   I would have to say the bag is still really comfortable with my camera, laptop, and life-equipment in it.   Honestly, this bag is completely under priced, for what it offers. If you're looking for a not clunky and ugly bag that has tons of room for everyday things, this is your bag.
0525951652|3.0|I really loved Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, so I thought I would love this one too. It was definitely interesting and I learned quite a bit about WWI and the time period, but it was way too long of a read. Toward the end, I found myself skipping over several pages at a time. As I turned the last page, instead of being sad to have to say goodbye to beloved characters, I breathed a long sigh of relief.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|The main thing I like about Limitless is that it wasn't predictable and it has great replay value. The movie is entertaining, exciting, tot at all boring or typical of the slew of \\"cookie-cutter\\" movies that are a dime a dozen these days. I definately agree with the synopsis of it being this year's sleeper. The tunnel vision effect might annoy some momentarily but it's a minor quibble. Watch this. It's worth my money and I'm glad I bought the blu-ray.

B00428CCPW|4.0|Before I start talking about the album, I should note that this review is for the double vinyl LP of Taylor Swift's \\"Speak Now\\". The vinyl is heavy weight (I wouldn't be surprised if this was 180 gram vinyl) and the packaging consists of a high quality gatefold jacket, covered with bright pictures and song lyrics. However, the sound of the music on the vinyl itself is very poor. The first song on side A, \\"Mine,\\" sounds acceptable, however, not perfect. As the album wears on, the imperfections laying in the vinyl transfer become more and more apparent. Distorted and hissy, the songs play back with a little less life than on the CD or even MP3. The vinyl was released just a month after the actual CD came out, leading me (at least) to believe that the production on this was rushed, in an effort to cash in on the growing vinyl trend. While it feels good to have Taylor on vinyl, it is quite unsatisfying when it just sounds so bad. In summary, great package, poor sound quality. Let's just hope that Big Machine takes notice of these problems and will keep them out of the pressing of Taylor's next record, or even her previous records. I, for one, would love to own \\"Fearless\\" on vinyl.  The music itself is worth discussing. Taylor Swift, the pop-country princess that we all met on her self-titled debut back in 2006, has grown up. The list of boys that she has been involved with has gotten larger, and so has her musical ambition. While many complain of the lyrical themes that she chooses to include in her songs, many of the motifs here have been subdued. Taylor Swift has always been introspective. Flashes of other people's interaction with her inspire what she writes about, but it is still introspective. Yes, even with the first song, she brings up that 2(:30) AM concept that she writes about all the time, but at the same time, what if Springsteen stopped singing about cars and radios? Things like that establish the artist as to who they are and what they romanticize. Taylorwrote these songs, not those critics in the audience. Talk to her after you've co-written a song as successful as \\"You Belong with Me.\\"  With \\"Speak Now,\\" the 21 year-old allows herself to stretch out and lets the music grow along with it. There are more strings, more instrumentation, more elaborate song structures... One listen of the song \\"Haunted,\\" and it becomes clear that Swift is taking risks and challenging her listeners. This isn't a bad thing, but it's definitely different. The simple pop jangle (as heard in past songs like \\"Our Song\\" and \\"Tell Me Why\\") is harder to find on this album. It's shrouded in Swift's stabs at musical maturity, which works more times than not, such as \\"Mean\\" and arguably the album's best song, \\"Enchanted.\\" There are still flashes of youth, from mid-song giggles and a song ending with Swift declaring, \\"The end,\\" but it is hard to decide, even after a whole year of listening to the album, whether or not this change in Taylor Swift is welcome. \\"Never Grow Up,\\" one of the album's less engaging tracks, begins as a one-way conversation to a young child, and evolves into a full-fledged letter to Taylor herself, reminding herself to hold onto the things that made her feel young. However the songs on \\"Speak Now\\" suggest that her coming of age has been a bit uncomfortable, as she skyrocketed into fame and maintained a long string of very public relationships, and to an extent, her coming of age feels contrived. You feel that Taylor is stuck in between what she knows and what would WOW her audience. While that's definitely not a bad thing, this album serves as a fine testament to where she is in her career. Taylor really lets her voice shine on this album, something that sort of falls by the wayside on other releases. Her leap into maturity is a good first step, but she has yet to find the perfect balance being ambitious, while also being good at what she knows she's good at--genuine, simple pop songs about love. If this is her transitional album from the simple and familiar into the more complex and elaborate, then I cannot wait for what Taylor Swift will come up with next.

B001G549C8|4.0|I recently watched the BBC remake of THE 39 STEPS starring Rupert Penry-Jones. I enjoyed it and knew I had to see the original Alfred Hitchcock version. I had purchased this DVD a while back but had never had a chance to watch the Hitchcock version and now was the time.  The version I bought on Amazon was from A2zcds.com. The heading said REMASTERED. Unfortunately, this was the worst quality \\"remaster\\" one could ever imagine. The film was hardly viewable and that is really sad for such a classic film. When buying 39 STEPS, do yourself a favor and be sure to buy a quality version such a Criterion. You can never go wrong with Criterion but of course, there surely are other good quality versions from other sources on Amazon. The audio sync was way off on this A2zcds.com version so it was a mess all over.  It is hard to catch ever nuance of a film when you are watching a really terrible copy, but there is no doubt Alfred Hithcock was on his way to a fine career with his earlier films. Hitchcock's THE 39 STEPS was made during the day when it was the story and great acting and directing that made a film shine. It's less about the visuals and definitely not about special effects. It's story driven and that is what we see here. Richard Hannay ends up with a dead spy in his bed. Not the best way to start a day. From then on, it is a race to outsmart the police and the dangerous foreign agents who are after him.   Hannay ends up in Scotland and the fun of the film is how he manages to escape from the the police on a train and get away from the deadly foreign agents. He survives a shooting and all sorts of mayhem. The film is a delightful step in the past when movies were about the story and the story was wonderful.

I would like to make a review on the product as a recording because its probably the worst recording I've heard in several decades. I've heard Death Cab for Cutie's Garage band records and even they sound better! It would be my guess that this album was recorded in a bathroom and then remastered to get a wet cardboard box effect. Please Mumford find your way into a proper studio so we can all enjoy your music as it was meant to be heard.
1423140591|4.0|The \\"Lost Hero\\" sort of hinted at what this book would be about. It's Percy's companion quest to Jason's. Juno's plans for getting the Greeks and Romans to work together are coming to fruition in this book.<br /><br />(Warning some **spoilers**)<br /><br />The book opens with Percy running from some gorgons.  He has grown up quite a bit since we first met him in 'The Lightning Theif,'  other characters frequently observe how he has a heroic air to him.  Percy, like Jason, also is suffering from amnesia. Instead of getting set up with a fake life though, he had been slumbering for months as well as being trained by Lupa, the she-wolf.  I think this bit probably contributed a great deal to his maturing).<br /><br />Percy literally bursts on the scene of the Roman camp and in typical Riordan fashion, its a great mix of action and humor. Getting to see Camp Jupiter  was really fun, Riordan did a great job of capturing ancient Rome in a nugget. He has their order and rules along with their crazy superstitions all playing their parts.  How he works in auguries is fantastic!<br /><br />Percy befriends two Roman campers.  Frank is unclaimed by his parent at the start of the book, he is clumsy and only good at archery.  He also has a tragic secret.  Hazel also has a secret, Frank is her only friend at the camp, as a daughter of Pluto she is regarded as a bit of an outcast.  She has other reasons though, to consider herself an outcast. Hazel has a pretty interesting past, that is tied in very directly with their current quest.  Riordan also does not reveal all of his secrets in this book, he has set up pretty clearly, some mysteries that needs to be solved in later books.<br /><br />As can be expected, Percy (still an amnesiac, though he seems a little more with it than Jason was) along with Frank and Hazel go on a quest--to Alaska.  Along the way we get to encounter other fun mythical people and creatures. Riordan does a great job of giving just enough information to move the plot forward while stirring a reader's curiosity to find out more. I'd suggest either/or both: [[ASIN:0316341517 Mythology]] or  [[ASIN:0486411079 Bulfinch's Greek and Roman Mythology: The Age of Fable (Dover Thrift Editions)]] .<br /><br />As they move forward in their quest each begins to learn more about themselves, allowing the reader to become more attached to them. We also get to become reacquainted with Percy, who really has come into his own.  He still manages to sound like a teenager, especially when talking with a pretty neat horse, later in the book.<br /><br />Another fun new character, Ella the Harpy is introduced to us. She is sort of a a rain-man type harpy and clearly is going to play a larger role down the road.  Currently she is important, but mostly comical.<br /><br />Riordan has worked his magic of humor and action once again, though I think things might be getting more serious.  Gaea seems like a more thoughtful and downright evil villain than any of the others the heroes have faced.<br /><br />This book also comes with a fun little bonus. Glued on the inside back cover is a sealed envelope. Inside is the 'never before seen 'Camp Jupiter' brochure. It has colored illustrations and describes the basics of Camp Jupiter.

B004H7QICG|4.0|I love this case: I used it a few months ago to build my first windows PC in years, and it definitely holds up. It's very roomy, solidly built and most important of all, quiet. It is very easy to install a proprietary Antec power supply.  Unfortunately, there are a few shall we say mishaps in (at least) this revision of the case that will affect your ability to build a system with it (but probably won't affect the system once it's built):  One, to hook up the USB3 plug in front, you pull a cable all the way through the case, out through a hole in the back, and plug it into a regular USB3 port on the mainboard in the rear. I am guessing there was no reliable spec for mainboard USB3 headers when the case was made, but huh, this looks seriously ugly. Especially as the cable is too short to usefully route next to the main board tray.  Two, if you have a very long video card, you won't be able to use the top 2.5\\" HDD cage. I had to get a set of 2.5->3.5\\" conversion brackets in order to mount this system's SSD in the lower drive cage. That was a bit disappointing, but I was waiting for some other components at the time anyway, so no time lost. If you are considering putting an SSD and a long video card into this case though, better get some brackets as well.  Three, the cable-routing partition behind the mainboard tray is very very narrow. The [[ASIN:B001RTPLWK Antec CP-850 850 Watt CPX Power Supply Unit]]'s cables do fit there, but when a few of them are in there, it's hard and fiddly to close the case.  Like I said above, these problems affected me only when building the system. Now that it's fully assembled, I'm happy as can be. My box is stable, well-cooled and very very quiet. I'm keeping it in my living room and can take naps next to it: That's something I have never been able to do with any other machine I've owned. (And one of them was a Mac Mini!)

B004TMJSAS|5.0|I am Dhruti's husband (John) writing from the USA (but originally from the UK) to give \\"Insurgentes\\" this review. I need to make my own account so i can write another review supporting this fantastic artist.  My wife (Dhruti) was also agree that Steven is a genius. We've followed Steven since 2004 since hearing his band \\"Porcupine Tree\\".  Where to start???  This is a masterpiece and find that Steven Wilson is like a fine wine and gets better the longer he's out there.  So eclectic is his style, that it's true to say that he is in the same vein as Frank Zappa in terms of his ability to creatively weave beautiful music in a variety of styles. You can see snippets of Zappa, Metallic, Rush, Yes, Pink Floyd and more in his music. Although his lyrics can be a little on the depressing side, the music is uplifting and very experimentational (is that a word?), that is work never sounds dull and always takes you on an epic journey.  Who needs love songs...we have enough of those around!! :-  Another thing I admire about Steven is his fondness for Packaging and the experience of the days of old when you would buy a new record and open up the packaging and read the lyrics and look at the pictures...I've missed those days, but Steven spares no expense to build quality into anything he touches. His live performances are also amazing - both solo and with Porcupine Tree.  Those that don't know his work, should really give it a shot. Check him out on YOUTUBE, then go buy his CD's..please!!!! His new CD (Grace for Drowning) is beautiful.
B005L38QHA|3.0|The Steelseries World of warcraft MMO Gaming Mouse \\"Legendary Edition\\" was just released. I managed to snag mine from Amazon.com although it seems none of the major retailers have gotten ahold of this product as of yet.  Packaging: Shipped in a sturdy box with a single plastic air bumper pouch, the box was in great shape. Easy to open (few sealing stickers but you shouldn't need scissors) and once inside, the cardboard insert containing the mouse slides right out. Not too much excess packaging, and the box looks great on display.  Build Quality: Upon initial inspection, the \\"Legendary\\" mouse appears alot \\"shinier\\" than previous Warcraft mouse models. The left and right mouse buttons are seemlessly connected to the main plastic cover that spans the top of the mouse. You can see all this in the pictures Amazon as provided. The plastic feels smooth and glossy versus the dull matte finish of the previous two models. The base of the mouse appears to have been coated in a strong rubberized finish that would probably take years to wear off. The other two mice also had this finish. The mouse \\"feet\\" that allow a mouse to glide along a surface on the bottom appear to be a durable plastic although I fear repetitive long term use may wear them out fast. The Optical light appears as a strong red beam. The cord leaves one to wonder considering the previous two Warcraft mice posessed a braided cable that was nearly tangle and snag proof. The \\"Legendary\\" takes back the traditional semi-rubber coated cord that is indicative of the typical mouse. A serious drawback to an hard-core gaming mouse fan.  Ergonomics: Placing ones hand upon the Steelseries \\"Legendary\\" Edition, one will notice its small (or medium) sized form factor. I have fairly large hands, so the mouse has taken some getting used to. The base of my palm rest firmly against my mousepad providing a comfortable feel rather than the bulky feeling of the SteelSeries WoW and WoW Cataclysm mice in which my palm would barely rest on the mouse pad but my fingers and center of my palm would have to arch around the mouse itself. Button placement is very comfortable and I don't feel as if I might accidently press a button unintentionally as was often the case with the \\"Legendaries'\\" predecessors. Steelseries has removed the three extra buttons that populated the Cataclysm Edition and four extra buttons as compared to the Original Warcraft Mouse. This makes the mouse appear less crowded and more visually appealing. The mouse can be easily utilized in game-play and general computer usage comfortable for hours if not more!  Ease of Setup and Use: Software is download only (although mouse itself is plug and play without the software goodies...) from [...] Software installs quickly and mouse prompts a firmware upgrade (Good to see that Steelseries is actively improving their product). A windows desktop bar icon will be present in the right hand corner where you can utilize a menu of options. The software, just like the other two steelseries Warcraft mice, allows you to create custom game macros and keybindings for world of warcraft to be implemented into the game. You can use the software or check the Enable In Game Mode option to key-bind your mouse buttons directly in-game. I prefer to macro them in game since it is much easier to test how comfortable I am with the placement of that ability as it is bound to the mouse button. You can upload up to 10 active character profile. You can change the color, intensity, and pulsation of the World of Warcraft light up window near the palm area of the mouse. For all intensive purposes, mine is set to red. Default is yellowish/gold.  Technology: The software is advanced although it was basically the same with the last two implementations. Small changes have ocurred over this time, but the basic design remains the same. It remains to be seen if this mouse has any defects like those that were present in the 1st generation Warcraft mouse. The major gripe I haveabout this mouse, technology wise, is the use of Optical technology instead of laser. Optical mice are great for every day computer users and are best for when you do not have a mouse pad. Laser mice are typically more expensive than optical and have a much harder time reading any other surface than a mousepad. Laser mice are best for computer gamers. Unfortunately the price is the same for this mouse as compared to other laser mice especially the previous two Warcraft mice which both featured laser technology. A disappointment, but I have yet to see the mouse actually become hindered by this issue and the speed remains superb while playing even the most mouse demanding game (Battlefield:3 Beta).  Implementation: The macros/keybinding work as intended. My computer recognized the mouse and the software installed without a hitch. The ergonomics will take some getting used to as the mouse is a bit different from the design of the World of Warcraft and Cataclysm Steelseries Mice. The mouse appears sturdy and rugged as well as being aestetically pleasing with the glossy lightning strike pattern arcing around a center light-up globe which pulsates the World of Warcraft logo. Gameplay feels comfortable, ensuring that long gaming hours won't leave you exhausted and with hand cramps! Ultimately the mouse is a trumph, even with a few minor cons, as Steelseries always seems to put 110% or more into each other their products. They've come a long way from the original WoW mouse and its flaws, why not give it a try today. You won't be disappointed!
B005LZZMRK|5.0|I am Dhruti's husband (John) writing from the USA (but originally from the UK) to give GFD this review. I need to make my own account so i can write another review supporting this fantastic artist.  My wife (Dhruti) was also agree that Steven is a genius. We've followed Steven since 2004 since hearing his band \\"Porcupine Tree\\".  Where to start???  Although I won't get my official copy till tomorrow, I've heard segments of all of the songs on YOUTUBE and think  it is a masterpiece. I thought \\"Insurgentes\\" was brilliant, but this guy's like a fine wine and just gets better the longer he's out there.  So eclectic is his style, that it's true to say that he is in the same vein as Frank Zappa in terms of his ability to creatively weave beautiful music in a variety of styles. You can see snippets of Zappa, Metallic, Rush, Yes, Pink Floyd and more in his music. Although his lyrics can be a little on the depressing side, the music is uplifting and very experimentational (is that a word?), that is work never sounds dull and always takes you on an epic journey.  Who needs love songs...we have enough of those around!! :-  Another thing I admire about Steven is his fondness for Packaging and the experience of the days of old when you would buy a new record and open up the packaging and read the lyrics and look at the pictures...I've missed those days, but Steven spares no expense to build quality into anything he touches. His live performances are also amazing - both solo and with Porcupine Tree.  Those that don't know his work, should really give it a shot. Check him out on YOUTUBE, then go buy his CD's..please!!!!
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|WOW.  Disney out did themselves with his 3d version.  It is perfect.  Every scene is presented  in 3d.  I love the fact that they used the whole screen and not the letter box.  The colors are brilliant, the sound is 100% dead on.  Can't say enough about this presentation of the lion king.  Worth the $49 ticket price...29 was a steal compared to some of The  3d movies out there.
B003R0MEZ4|4.0|The sixth season, filled with turmoil off camera, is the worst of all the seasons; however, the BAU team (and the cast and crew of the show) soldiers on the best they can(and kudos to them for still being good, though not great, despite the powers that be attempting to destroy everything good about the show).  The best thing about this season is the music -- and I never say that about Criminial Minds.  This season was easier for me to watch the second time around knowing my BAU family would be back together as they should be come season 7.
006056251X|4.0|Evangeline's tired of her family abusing her. She's tired of them telling her what to do. She certainly isn't going to marry her cousin. When she finds out his intentions, she takes matters into her own hands.<br /><br />She shows up quite alone and unannounced at St. Vincent's door. She has a plan and begs him to hear her out. She offers him the chance for the fortunes he so desperately needs and he offers her freedom and the chance to escape her family.<br /><br />They set off for Gretna Green with no delay. When they come back, Evangeline finds the father she rarely sees dying. She rushes to his side to nurse him.<br /><br />He owns a gambling house which St. Vincent takes over. Together they two of them must decide their relationship, their lives, and if they will change.<br /><br />My Thoughts: I have mixed thoughts, I liked this book, but it took me a while to come around to St. Vincent (the horrible man from It Happened One Autumn). Thus, I didn't like this one was much as the previous two, but I did still enjoy it. I loved Evangeline standing up for herself and changing her life and living by her rules. I loved how the relationships with the Wallflowers struggled a bit. I wish we could have seen more interactions between the four girls. All in all, I'm curious to see what comes next for the friends in Scandal in Spring and then Wallflower Christmas!
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I mostly listen to electronic music since I remember but I was interested to hear<br />this debut album since I found Scotty a very special & talented kid in American Idol.<br /><br />Well, I'm listening to it right now for second round on Spotify & must say that<br />this is the first time in my life that I'm listening to an entire country music album - Twice, back to back !<br /><br />This is simply Pure Good American Music. Everybody will remember this great debut album.<br /><br />Thanks Scotty. I will follow you.
1933492910|5.0|This book is full of beauty, fantasy, whimsy...and wonderful adventures in animal anatomy! Filled with gorgeous drawings of creatures you've likely seen before- and many you can only imagine seeing in your dreams (and a few found only in faraway-land nightmares!), Terryl Whitlatch's creatures leap, bite and claw their way from the pages in rich, organic color -- you're sure to find countless favorites to share with friends and family.   Hopefully we do see quite a bit more of Ms. Whitlatch's imaginative animals in the future. Seeing her work in print and on film would be a delight for anyone who looks forward to the latest sci-fi blockbusters and best-selling fantasy novels... or for those who just appreciate what nature and brilliant imagination have to offer.  A great coffee table book, conversation starter...and inspiration for those who enjoy art or love to draw!   Well done, Terryl and Gilbert!
B00028HBKC|5.0|well done accurate content some license but overall very good.  The garden scene was a little too much license but I can overlook this for the rest of the content was very good.
B004EPZ09S|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />In his new pseudo-documentary, Contagion, Steven Soderbergh has endorsed the idea that modern medicine has taken the place of world religion and elevated the physicians and research scientists to the role of high priests.  Soderbergh is in perfect sync with fear-mongering health organizations such as the CDC, who manufacture health epidemics in order to peddle vaccines to an unsuspecting public, who have gladly given up any sense of individual responsibility for taking care of their own health.  The 'Contagion' is an event that government health bureaucrats probably unconsciously wish for; after all, such an event would confirm all their dire predictions and place them in a position of complete power and control.  Victims in the 'Contagion' must undergo suffering akin to Christ on the cross.  Their rite of 'baptism' is through the modern vaccine, where their 'demons' are exorcised and they end up owing a life-time debt to the medical and research establishment for supposedly saving their life.<br /><br />Unfortunately for modern medicine, contagions as depicted in Soderbergh's film, are strictly a work of complete fiction.  Invariably, every few years, the CDC, partnering with local health organizations, warn of crippling health pandemics, which can only be prevented by mass inoculations (leading to billions of dollars of profits by pharmaceutical companies).  Take, for example, West Nile Virus, one of the latest health scares which was supposed to cause havoc throughout North America.  Usually its small sample of victims turn out to be elderly people who already are suffering from a myriad of health problems.  But of course the pundits of orthodox medicine conclude that all these peoples' problems stem from a single source: a mosquito bite.<br /><br />In Soderbergh's perverse world, alternative practitioners are the 'heretics' who must be suppressed. Jude Law's blogger, Alan Krumweide, has the temerity to expose CDC head Ellis Cheever, who has given advance warning of the impending contagion crisis to family and friends so that they're able to flee Chicago before a quarantine has been imposed. Soderbergh's strategy is to temporarily have Krumweide take down the saintly Cheever a peg, in order to show that he's 'only human'. Later saintly Cheever, gives up his own precious vaccine to save the son of a janitor who works at CDC headquarters. The 'fallen' Cheever (also blamed for delays in the dissemination of an effective vaccine) is restored to the pantheon of saints after his self-sacrifice involving the janitor's son. Meanwhile, Krumweide is exposed as a fraud, after peddling a homeopathic remedy as a cure (which he's surreptitiously marketed to investors) and pretending as well that he's been infected with the virus. Homeland Security partners with modern medicine, just as the Catholic church found their own government allies in bygone days, to take down anyone who dared to question their dogmatic belief systems. Soderbergh is smugly satisfied as the 'evil' blogger is taken away in handcuffs by 'valiant' government security agents!<br /><br />If the imperfect Dr. Cheever is 'canonized' at film's end, there's no need for Dr. Ally Hextall to have her reputation sullied at all. After all, it's Dr. Hextall who identifies the characteristics of the MEV-1 virus , linking it to a genetic mix of bat and pig viruses. Hextall's role here is way beyond a mere priest. She can be likened to a modern day Jesus, a veritable Savior, who miraculously discovers that elusive cure, a vaccine that immediately provides the immunity to the deadly contagion. At the conclusion of 'Contagion', we learn of the pseudo-science behind the MEV-1 virus' origins. It's simply a matter of a bat dropping part of an uneaten banana into a pig's trough. The pig who eats the infected banana ends up in the kitchen of a Macao casino; and because the chef merely forgets to wash his hands, he somehow transmits the virus to Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow). On the other hand, it's unclear why others, such as everyman Mitch Emhoff and his daughter Jory, are immune to the virus, despite close contact with initial victim Beth.<br /><br />If alternative practitioners are directly linked to the work of the devil, bureaucrats who seek to stymie the 'godly' work of vaccine researchers, run a close second. Dr. Mears (Kate Winslet) an 'Epidemic Intelligence Officer' is rebuffed by local bureaucrats who are reluctant to commit resources to handle the impending crisis. Worse are the officials who send a ransom of placebos following World Health Organization epidemiologist Orantes's kidnapping by a Chinese epidemiologist after he attempts to save the remaining survivors in his own village who have no access to the 'precious' vaccines. Note more saintly self-sacrifice: Dr. Mears succumbs to the deadly contagion and Orantes nobly runs back to the village to warn them that the vaccines they've obtained, are bogus!<br /><br />In the 1950s, orthodox medicine elevated their first 'miracle worker' to the pantheon of modern day world saviors. That man's name was Dr. Jonas Salk--creator of the polio vaccine. Now Soderbergh wants to outdo even Salk; his 'Contagion' can perhaps be seen as an allegory, likening the deadly plague to cancer itself. Soderbergh's vaccine is so powerful, that it prevents the eradication of the human race.<br /><br />Ultimately, Soderbergh never questions the 'gospel truth' of modern orthodox medicine but always sticks to the 'company line'. Instead he would do well to listen to Edda West who cogently sets the record straight in regards to that earlier 'epidemic' in her article, 'Polio Perspectives': \\"That the polio virus is the sole cause of polio is accepted by most people as gospel, and that the Salk and Sabin vaccines eradicated polio in the western world is etched into our collective consciousness as the major medical miracle of our time. But the history of polio and its vaccines is shrouded in a murky mist of politico/scientific manipulation, altered statistics, redefinition and reclassification of the disease, increased cases of vaccine induced paralytic polio, and monkey viruses transmitted by contaminated vaccines to millions of people worldwide.\\"her hand, it's unclear why others, such as everyman Mitch Emhoff and his daughter Jory, are immune to the virus, despite close contact with initial victim Beth.

B000ATQYT2|4.0|They took out one of the songs that I feel is critical to the plot. Other than that it was great. I just watch it with youtube handy to replace the missing piece.
B005D81W5Q|5.0|A great little fun filled comedy, starring Cameron Diaz, Jason Segel, Justin Timberlake, Judy Punch and more. While a teacher as bad is this would never fly in real life (or would it?...) I have met people who her charactor reminds me of. This was a very entertaining movie. Would definitely be a good date movie. I really enjoyed the growing chemistry between Diaz and Segel's charactors, and the hilarious finish to the scene with Diaz and Timberlake at the motel in Springfield. Another great scene was the car wash scene - sort of an homage combining Daisy Duke with the infamous Whitesnake video. Great ensemble cast, and as polictically incorrect as I could hope for.
B004ZNARH4|2.0|Nice but really nothing there worth that much unless you play with marbles but enjoy those rare 8 track recordings on CD's.  Hard Cores will buy anything.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|My family loves just about all things Uno, so when I could get the game for my phone and only for $1 I bought it.  I have to say it plays pretty well on my Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant.  Its a little slow in laying down my cards but the other players move fast.  Still have to figure out how to call a player on a card play but other than that so far I'm liking the game well enough.
B004VMX5TQ|1.0|This CD is unlistenable.Could they turn up a audience track any louder?I missed what the stoner in the third row said.What bootlegger did they get to record the drums?Was he stoned too?I never cared for the bloated sound female backup singers in Hometown rock .I like Bob Seger but Live Bullet's got more of the sound.
B004NSULHM|5.0|This album is more thematic and therefore less far ranging than some of their other work, i.e. Ok Computer and In Rainbows, but it is very powerful and daring. Obviously when you take risks and don't clone your previous albums some people won't like it. \\"Little by Little\\" and \\"Codex\\" rank among my favorite Thom York tracks. Although feral is a bit strange, perhaps related to some chemical compound I haven't discovered, I enjoy the whole thing, and even experienced an emotion or two. For those complaining about the drum synths, they've been experimenting with this since Hail to the Thief so you must have been whining for a long time. And while the percussion can't compare to the master of drum technology that Mr Creep had working with him during his side project UNKLE, I think it still enhances the uniqueness of their sound. Either way it's not pervasive and doesn't distract from their lyrical and melodic strengths.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Wow! I don't care how many times I've seen this film. I don't care how much cynicism there is about 3D, and I don't care how cliched it sounds. Seeing The Lion King in this format was a new, eye-popping experience! I thought I knew how beautiful the backgrounds were; now they are astonishingly rich and gorgeous. I thought 3D animated characters might seems more flat and superficial, but they're not; the producers did an amazing job with realistic perspectives. And I've heard many comments about how 3D makes movies only seem darker, but not here; the colors are as bold and bright as technically possible. I'm not kidding, folks, I never rant and rave like this. If you own a 3D TV, go for it. If you liked this movie, you'll love it. And if you love this film, prepare for bliss.    Happy footnote: I just read today that thanks to the success of this release, Disney is now going to work on 3D versions of The Little Mermaid, Finding Nemo, and my favorite choice, Monsters Inc. Bring it on!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|The old sharpeners from 1930's will still always be best, but this is much cheaper and smaller.  The price is great and you can feel the difference.  Be sure to follow the on box directions, they seem important.  Exactly what you expect, but I figured it deserved the 5 stars so i made this short review.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This version of Jane Eyre takes the story from a different perspective.  We see Jane suffering her extreme disappointment and loss first.  Then the story develops in retrospect to the point where we understand what she is suffering, then it goes forward.  This is done with wonderful acting, costumes, and sets.  It is one for your collection!  LJ
0823095223|5.0|Great information for artists, and a fun book for the fan or collector who might just be curious how these products are created.  Stage by stage explanations, lots of pictures.  I don't suppose any book could possibly hold \\"all\\" the tricks and secrets of the trade, but I think this one has enough to keep most people busy.  The photos show the mastery of the workmanship well enough to show that the authors know what they're talking about.
B005HGZV6U|2.0|Just to get this straight, the only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because this is a good movie (for Daft Punk fans) and I hadn't owned the DVD.<br /><br />That being said, if you own the DVD, skip this purchase.  The 'HD' is more like an upscaled DVD rip.  I was looking forward to good bonus features, like interviews with Daft Punk, but they are not here, and the menu for the few bonus features is very confusing.  At least on the PS3 I played the movie on, there was no text to describe what the bonus features were.  Just a bunch of boxes that did different things.<br /><br />I'd say get this if you don't have the DVD, but try waiting for the price to go down.  I'm a huge fan of Daft Punk and I kind of regret the purchase.
0740785508|5.0|What a great book!  Just a joy to thumb through and look at the illustrations or to pick up and read on a subject.  You can open the book to any random page and just get lost in another world.  Just enjoy the marvelous art work that presents other worlds, then read a bit about the real world ways that James Gurney made the art work.  How can one make living with dinosaurs look so inviting?  Every time I look into the book, I think \\"I want to live there!\\"  Well, except for some of the great fantasy combat scenes...  This book should be required in every painting class.  Artists, portrait artists, commercial artists, designers, art directors and every other sort of artist will gain tremendously from a study of this book.  My hat is off to Mr. Gurney!  What a great book!
B005IEF27O|2.0|I love Primus and many of Les's other projects, but in the last few years everything he puts out sounds exactly the same. Very tired of it. I was happy to hear a new album was out, but was very disapointed when I started listening to it. Sounds like \\"OF FUNGI AND FOE\\" and \\"Purple Onion\\" again and again and again...
0740797719|5.0|This is, literally, the best book on Color (and Light) since M. E. Chevreul wrote the \\"Principles of Color Harmony and Contrast,\\" in 1839.  The art work superbly demonstrates each principle that James Gurney presents.  His writing style is organized and complete - one principle at a time.  The principle explained on one page with the example on the adjoining page.  Each principle is discussed to a level that is satisfying to the technically inclined, but artistic enough to satisfy those who need a more aesthetic approach.  \\"Color and Light\\" by James Gurney is an absolute must in the library of every teacher, artist, professional in the art industry, student artist or anyone who desires to better understand painting.
B005NNVPOO|4.0|As others have said, the merits of Animals isn't up for debate, but the remastered production that is in question. Animals in my opinion is the second best Floyd record behind The Final Cut because both records are more cohesive thematically than DSOTM and The Wall and really require dedication from the listener. Whereas The Final Cut benefits from the remaster to sharpen the affects and the addition of \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" the mood of Animals is done a disservice by the sharper sounds. What aids in Animals oppressiveness is the muddy, dank, wet blanket thrown over it recording. By sharpening the vocals and drums it makes it more like Wish You Were Here is its outer spaciness, rather than grounded in the agricultural mud and industrial sludge that permeates the album. The record cover which conveys the smoggy, 40 Watt sun environment, tits-up pig power station perfectly symbolises the theme (best Floyd cover too BTW).  The music conveys the imagery of those days where while it's sunny, the air is damp, the shadows are long, the ground is wet and just being alive is dirty.  This remastered production helps separate the vocals from the music in the mix so that they aren't wallowing in the filth like a pig, which oddly disappoints me. I do appreciate the boost the guitars have on Dogs and the keyboard parts overall, as a new listener will realize just how much Richard Wright was responsible for the atmosphere of Pink Floyd's music, but again that elevation takes the user from out under the leaden sky a little too much and puts them into space.   I've always wanted Animals to get the deluxe treatment from the band (and again it still doesn't!) but this tinny remaster isn't doing it for me. For what this record is about, the original 70's studio limitations actually make it work better than the digital clarity of the new mix. It's a five star record to be sure but for this version the clarity in production knocks it back to a four.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I rarely rate apps, and even more rarely do I comment on them, but I love this game. the only way this game could be better is if it were Final Fantasy. OLD SCHOOL RPGs FTW!
B005NA3B8U|5.0|really awesome game, just like the original version from the 80s. the finger controls  do get in the way, but at the same time I couldn't think of a better way to control them on a phone. works great on my EVO 4G
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Once again, Riordan wrote a great book.  It was good how he continued the same setting and story as PJO (percy jackson and the olympians).  If you haven't read those yet, definitely read them first, although the book explains  the characters thouroughly.  You will find yourself more familiar with the book that way.  I am a kid, but this series is enjoyable for adults, too.  I am a bookworm, and I know a good book when I read one,and it is totally worth the money.
B003OWVHVC|3.0|got a chance recently to listen to his album all the way through and it had some cool moments. vocally he reminds of Anthony Hamilton from the Bill Withers school of Harmony and tone. Miss fortune is a cool cut and I need a Dollar is very direct and on time.  dug the arrangements and Production here.  this is a cool album and versatile.
B002VECMAE|5.0|Making a comedy out of a pretty serious book is no mean feat.But Grant Heslov made a film , with the input of some great actors, that brings out the absurdity of some of the ideas that Jon Ronson \\"uncovered\\". To the credit of the screen writer , he devised a way to contain the ideas within the first half of the book, such that some characters are direct representatives of real people, and some are amalgams of several characters. Just how far the Jedi references are meant to be whimsical is unclear, and the idea of applying \\"non-lethal force\\" is close to being an oxymoron; however, listen to the Jon Ronson comentary after you have seen the film, and the whimsy/comedy becomes closer to farce.  Its clear that Grant Heslov had the idea of the film based on its entertainment value, since Jon Ronson clearly states that the second half of his book draws some fairly dark conclusions.There is a lot here that draws some potentially scarey conclusions, since the content is implicitly clear that these ideas are still around. Basically, you can watch this film as a piece of absurd entertainment, or if you listen to some the darker elements, and follow it up with some research, and you just might have your world view changed.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I grew up playing 8 and 16 bit RPGs and this instantly transported me back to that time.  The skill and weapon systems are surprisingly well thought out.  the controls aren't perfect, but I haven't seen any RPG control for android that feels completely at home on a phone.  All I can say is that I am 4 hours in and I am hooked, which is more than I can say for the vast majority of RPGs on the android platform.  If you enjoyed the early Final Fantasys and Dragon Warriors, give this one a try, you might be surprised.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Polished, looks good, level additions seem regular...  But too easy to perfect each level.  Can't give 5 stars without a challenge.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|Well the critics got this one right; Michael Bay was a good director until he got big and lost his perspective. Dirty old man syndrome? Yes, what a joke. I was looking forward to intelligent Sci-Fi and got crap. The reference to Obama in an unreal world was stupid (I came to get away from real world politics). The treatment of the woman in the movie was degrading (glad the other actress bowed out...what a tear down}. It was a shame that the very good actors that came back to do this film had to deal with a totally self-involved director. The animation was excellent but the story was trash. I am soo sorry I spent any money on this film.
B005D51JQQ|2.0|I love the box set concept and Sting is an artist that can surely have one. I like the box set but I agree that it should have more rarities, live music, demos, etc. Sting has plenty of rehearsal recordings in a vault somewhere and this box set would have been an excellent opportunity to put all that music out... Now, the real issue here is the price!
B0012TUPRQ|5.0|hello,    i can now change the stock long arm on my ram gps mount to adapt my digital camera and camcorder when needed.  the original long arm is great for the gps, but the long arm stuck out too far to balance the cameras.  the shorter 3 inch model makes it closer to the car, boat, table, surface, etc.  i also bought the rubber ball base for the camera mounts. RAM Mounting Systems RAM-B-202AU 1\\" Rubber Ball Base with 1/4\\"-20 Stud For Camera.  It works well and makes it less obtrusive when mounting both to a specific surface.  great product and great delivery by gps city.
B00007KWHN|5.0|The first album I bought by YES was what I considered to be a visual masterpiece musically as well as a visual extravaganza with the Vinyl gatefold. At the time I bought it, I was impressed with how the cover  and inside gatefold) meshed with the music within. This led to me buying the cassette of FRAGILE which unknown to me also had CLOSE TO THE EDGE on the B side for reasons only the Australian record company might know, since I have never heard of these two albums sold like this especially with no credit to the B side. Since I was hooked musically on to the YES phenomena, I decided to buy earlier items, one of which was THE YES ALBUM especially, for reasons I do not recall at the time, the song section of starship Trooper with WURM  I later learned it was a type of Glacier).Anyway, the cassette was great, and still over the years I have enjoyed the music, and the creative work of this album. Although I had gone backwards in the works to find it, it still seemed consistent with the later work.    The Re-mastered sound is superb, and is consistently great, especially after buying later items. Although the music is different, with the content restored, the studio version of CLAP is intriguing since it uses much of the phrasing and in some places note for note, that is found in the masterwork MOOD FOR A DAY. THE YES ALBUM still seems like a concept album in all respects, unlike YES SONGS which is divergant, but still contains great content.The Booklet is a great addition, except for the waffle written by a philosophy professor. How any of the work on this album can be \\"Blocky\\" is an absurd statement, and then he also states its simple as well as complex, which a philosophy professor should know is a non-sequitur. Since the prof writes in \\"cloth-eared syllogisms\\" I am not too surprised that he said that.A good comparison for useful writing is the one \\"page\\" of notes in the re-release of FRAGILE which adds more to understanding the music than three pages of consumate waffle. The Album is what it is; the prof should have said more about how the guitar in WURM was out of phase and still managed to do what it did, or what Guitar was used for WURM. Or another interesting point might have been the amp stacks, or how they got the sounds they got in the studio. If you have to have 3 pages of claptrap on a booklet in a great album, pseudo philosophy is not for the booklet. And if you have to explain the beautiful, Timeless and sincere lyrics of YES, then leave that to the music.
0062112430|5.0|Holy crap! This book killed my soul. But in a good way. The descriptions are so painfully meaningful and poetically written. After finishing it, I am dumbfounded and it is consuming all my thoughts.<br /><br />The premise is that love is a disease. Lucky for the whole population, a cure was found and can be administered at the age of 18. Lena has gone through life longing for the cure. After she meets Alex (ahhh . . . Alex) she sees the world in a completely new way. She realizes that the cure is really just a shroud of apathy that helps everybody conform to the lifeless world around them. Love breathes new life into her and she can never be the same.<br /><br />Alex is so sweet and achingly real. I'm kind of in love with him ;-)<br /><br />I think I might have died a little when I realized I have to wait until March for the next book. Sometimes the wait makes it even better, right?
0142410705|5.0|I have to say, John Green's second novel is very different from his other stuff, probably that it's the only one he wrote in third person. I really enjoyed these characters, so much that I almost thought I knew them. They're very believeable, lovable, and very funny. It's different from Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns, but it's a great second novel, and I would most definately recomend it to anyone.  READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!
B005G4TJI4|2.0|They need to get a new director and new script writer.. They just keep getting worse and worse.. Get rid of the Witwicky's.. It was funny the 1st time,now everything is just drawn out.. I never saw it in the theater and just bought it on blu ray.. I'm regretting it.. I don't understand why they don't use the original voice for Megatron.. I won't watch another one.. They should add the Dinobots,and make Devastater like in the cartoons,5 robots merged into a giant one,not a cross between a cement mixer and garbage compactor.. Cmon,what a shame.. It could be so great if someone actually cared about it.
B005LAJ1CC|1.0|This is not a review but a call for action on the part of the company holding the US rights to this film.  I had to give it a \\"Rating\\" to make this post.  It will be available in the UK on 10/10 in Blu-ray and non blu-ray format but only for region 2/PAL.  Since HBO is showing the film this week in the USA in two parts, would imagine that is the reason for the delay.  For those who don't have HBO, you are SOL.  Once again, we're held hostage to the corporate greed.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|but this was an amazing and eerie movie. I found this movie to be a good psychological flick, but it takes a certain sort of person to watch it. There's not a whole lot of talking and the majority of the movie is really left for you to decipher and think about. If you don't like to think about a movie in depth, and pretty much want everything translated and spelled out for you, then I DON'T recommend this. Now, if you just want to watch a movie and explore it's meaning, this is right for you.   The acting is well done, and in terms of horror itself, this isn't a particularly gory scary film - more of a medium to mild thriller. It's the idea behind everything that matters. In any case, I loved it and if you can be patient and watch less talkative films without getting bored, this is for you.
030788743X|5.0|I love this book. I polish off a lot of books, and once or twice a year I read something that is so original and enjoyable that I recommend it to everyone I know. This is the first book in months that I've felt that way about.  I am not a videogame fan, a child of the 80s, or a particularly big science fiction fan. While those are all elements of the book, you don't have to know much about those things to really enjoy this novel. It is just a fun adventure about a really believable not-too-distant world in which an awful lot of people spend more time plugged in to their virtual worlds than living in the real world. As I said in the title of this review--- it reminded me of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" in that it is a novel where you root for the poor, unfortunate kid to find the golden ticket (in this case easter eggs in the virtual worlds). I read this while I was on traveling with other people and finally had to tell everyone else to go away for a few hours so I could finish the book off.   The closest book I to \\"Ready Player One\\" that read this year was \\"Robopocalyse\\" which was entertaining and enjoyable but not at all original,and I didn't run around telling everyone I knew to read it. \\"Ready Player One\\" is one of those rare books that is a truely original story, as well as being fun, entertaining, and a book that really hooks you in.
B00005RHGL|5.0|This directors cut made a great movie even better. It explained plot points that were murky in the theatrical release and made for a much more coherant film. I don't know why THIS wasn't the original release.

B004J4WKTW|2.0|This book came highly recommended, and I was told about all of the hype surrounding it.  Naturally I was intrigued, so I decided to give it a whirl.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  The book started out incredibly slow.  In fact, I debated whether or not to even continue reading, because it was almost painful forcing myself to keep turning the pages.  I found myself completely unable to focus on the disjointed plot. The character development throughout the book was seriously lacking.  At the end, I was just beginning to feel as though I was starting to get to know the characters, but at that point it was too little, too late.  I read all the way to the end, and I admit that the imagery became much more interesting as the book went on.  I become more engaged in the story about 1/2 way through, but even then, I was more caught up in the description of the circus, than in the plot or characters.   Overall, it was a disappointment. I feel like the imagination involved in creating the circus could have gone in so many directions, but unfortunately, it went nowhere. :(

B0051T46XM|4.0|My first love, & probably my favorite sub-genre in Sci Fi/Fantasy/Horror, is the giant monster movie! As a kid in the 60's, I went to the theater to see a plethora of Godzilla & dinosaur movies like, \\"One Million Years BC,\\" \\"Valley of the Gwangi,\\" \\"When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth.\\" I waited impatiently for all Godzilla's kin to show up on late night TV on the weekends, but it was not just Godzilla type movies, as the 50's brought out the giant mutant movies I loved dearly like, \\"It Came From Beneath the Sea,\\" \\" The Deadly Mantis,\\" \\"Tarantula,\\" & more! I was amazed as a child at the original \\"King Kong.\\"<br /><br />I'm 51 years old now, & I still can't get enough of giant monster movies, & luckily they seem to becoming back in vogue again the last several years! So the 8 year old in me was very excited when I read about \\"Troll Hunter,\\" & all the good reviews it was getting. Unfortunately, it did not play in my hometown, so I had to wait for the DVD. Was I disappointed?<br /><br />One big NO! \\"Troll Hunter is one of the most clever of the recent run of giant monster movies, & it has stiff competition. I was thrilled with the detail of this documentary (mockumentary) type story, one whose style stems from the \\"Blair Witch,\\" as far as narrative. The performances, or should I say the dubbing, was well above average. The \\"Troll Hunter\\" himself was a fascinating character that had huge amounts of knowledge about the different kind of Trolls & their habits. His secretive nature added to his stigma. The college kids were all done in a intelligent manner, not just air heads filling screen time.<br /><br />Now the Trolls. The Trolls were GREAT! Huge lumbering beast right out of a fairy tale! Their appearance was somewhat comedic (but Trolls have always been funny looking), but very well done! Their special effects & CGI was superb! I loved the Troll hunters explanation of why the older Trolls have three heads, but I won't spoil it for those who have not seen the movie. I really like how there were different type of Trolls & that they were territorial.<br /><br />\\"Troll Hunter\\" was like watching a guide to Trolls. It brought up Troll subjects that I would of never guessed at, & it did it well. It really could have one believing in their habits, if they existed, but of course they don't, & that is the only minor complaint I have about the film. How could people not know such huge creatures existed??? But, then again, it is just a movie. A movie for all of us that like to transport ourselves back to when we thought such things existed in our 8 year old minds, even if we have 51 year old bodies.<br /><br />4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiecet type of Trolls & that they were territorial.  \\"Troll Hunter\\" was like watching a guide to Trolls.

B00006JDVV|5.0|It's 2020 in post-apocalyptic England. Was it nuclear war? Global climate change? Viral contagion? Mass hysteria?!  No !! It was ........dragons!! What a hoot. Big bad very well rendered Dragons are reproducing & living on the ashes they create as they torch everything in sight. The stalwart Brits are holding their own,barely, unitl the crazy ass Americans (McConaughey in a fab-tastic beef-a-licious body)show up straight outta.........Coffeeville Kansas?!?! Maybe I got that wrong.........what-EVER.......doesn;t matter..they team up to take down the BIG BUll Dragon & the action is great -- the female chopper pilot is excellent as a tough woman who is rationally scared to death of the Dragons-- McConaughey actually has an arc of emotional growth as the fearless/arrogant American who suffers great loss & must keep going after being humbled by the Dragon--Bale is always excellent & his best pal is the witty Gerard Butler! Put your feet up, sit back and just get sucked into this sci-fi flame-fest.
1935251740|4.0|This theory seemed so outlandish that it just kept gnawing at me until I gave it a try. I came away from this book thinking that Robert Lanza is onto something here. With brilliant anecdotes, illustrations, and wonderful personal stories, Robert Lanza presents his case beautifully that creation exists because we are here to observe it. Confusing? At the subatomic level particles only exist as potential energy unless being observed. He had me thinking that my refrigerator does not exist if I am upstairs sleeping and not observing it. This theory is given credence by some seemingly convincing scientific experiments. I gave it 4 stars because Lanza promises in the beginning of the book not to intermingle God in his theory and then proceeds to give some explanations on how a star was observed over a certain baby in a manger. Otherwise it is a fascinating read and was certainly written for the layperson.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Uber thrilled with the DVD. Very happy with purchase price, shipment was speedy, and DVD arrived as it was described.
B0052REUW0|5.0|This is a huge book, but as Pinker says, it is a huge subject. He organizes himself by lists. First, there are six significant trends which have led to a decrease in violence.<br />1. Our evolution from hunter gatherers into settled civilizations, which he calls the Pacification Process.<br />2. The consolidation of small kingdoms and duchies into large kingdoms with centralized authority and commerce, which he calls the Civilizing Process.<br />3. The emergence of Enlightenment philosophy, and it's respect for the individual through what he calls the Humanitarian Revolution.<br />4. Since World War II, violence has been suppressed, first by the overwhelming force of the two parties in the Cold War, and more recently by the American hegemony. Pinker calls this the Long Peace.<br />5. The general trend, even apart from the Cold War, of wars to be more infrequent, and less violent, however autocratic and anti-democratic the governments may be. Call this the New Peace.<br />6. Lastly, the growth of peace and domestic societies, and with it the diminishing level of violence through small things like schoolyard fights, bullying, and picking on gays and minorities. He titles this the Rights Revolution.<br /><br />Pinker then goes on to examine the traditional explanations of violence, the traditional explanations of human nature which account for violence. There is practical violence, which you might call necessary violence. Then there are dominance, revenge, sadism, and ideologically driven violence. Opposing these are what he calls the better angels of human nature, empathy, self-control, our moral sense, and reason. Many of these characteristics are shared with our primate brethren, the chimpanzees on down, but some of them are uniquely human. With our ability to reason, and the unique human ability to impute motive to conspecifics of our own or other tribes, and our ability to express ourselves verbally, we are better able than any other species to negotiate our way through situations of conflict. A good deal of the decline in violence has to do with the maturation of these processes through the genetic evolution of the human animal, and more recently, through the evolution of our society and the ways in which societies socialize their members.<br /><br />He concludes with five historical forces, which I find a little bit harder to grasp, but which serve as a vehicle for explanations of a number of interesting phenomena in the recent evolution of society. We have evolved Leviathan societies, in which the individual is pretty well controlled by state force. Not only our police, but our employers, our schools, and every other institution holds violence firmly in check as a matter of its own functioning. Other forces are commerce, which only happens when the partners are on peaceful terms, the evolution of women from mere propagators of the species to intellectual equals and partners in all of our undertakings, the growing information networks which bind us together, a process he calls cosmopolitanism, and lastly the increasing application of reason, which we would probably call the scientific basis, to human affairs, leading to a recognition that violence is in most circumstances not the best way to achieve one's ends.<br /><br />In his discussion of ideologically driven violence he spends several pages discussing ideologies themselves.  Specifically, he describes the groupthink environment in which a group comes to embrace dogmas that most of the individuals within the group would reject, or at least question, if they approached them on their own.  The key mechanism is punishment of dissention, the ostracism of people who don't mouth the groupthink.  Sounds to me to describe political correctness at Harvard just as much as Communism under Stalin.  I am pleased that Pinker had the courage to resist said PC and defend the science behind the observations which got Larry Summers fired as president of Harvard.  Calls to mind the \\"Kinsley gaffe\\", \\"A truthful statement told accidentally, usually by a politician.\\"<br /><br />For a guy with a long history of writing about evolution, he seems to pretty much avoid its implications in this book.  In fact, he has more or less morphed from a true scientist to a social scientist/historian.  Whereas \\"The Language Instinct\\" and \\"Words and Rules\\" got into leading edge science, and \\"The Blank Slate\\" brought us up to date on the theory of human evolution, this book is pretty much a compilation of other peoples' statistics and observations, weighted with Pinker's opinions.<br /><br />The question that will go through every reader's mind when reading a book on the subject this vast is \\"how do you know?\\" Pinker answers that question in a way that I really admire - statistics. He says that most of us reason from anecdotal evidence. For instance, because the news media play up terror deaths such as those in Fort Hood, they tend to be grossly exaggerated in our conscience. We would tend to equate the danger of death by an act of terror with that of dying from a lightning strike or industrial accident, when the latter are far more probable. Also, because there have been terror acts in the news lately, we would overlook the fact that the number of deaths attributable to terror have fallen off dramatically over the past few decades. Pinker does a good job of educating us by taking on our common sense understandings, showing that they are erroneous, and showing us a statistical methodology by which we can realistically estimate broad societal phenomena such as terror, death by war, murder and so on.<br /><br />More than in his other books, Pinker reminds us of his Jewish roots, gently chafing Christianity for celebrating the sacrifice of an innocent man, and turning the cross, the instrument of sacrifice, into its holy icon. He also takes the obligatory swipes at George W. Bush for his bloodthirsty wars, conveniently overlooking the neocons like Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle who provided the intellectual foundation for the adventure. He also conveniently over looks the fact that President Obama, despite his vehement campaign rhetoric to the contrary, has continued the wars, presumably also with strong backing from AIPAC, and that he has likewise been captive to advisors such as Larry Summers. His writing is such a thrill to read that I overlook these tropes with an grin. And I appreciate that he is willing to defend the \\"dead white men\\" of the Enlightenment and make politically incorrect observations about the different peoples who make up America.<br /><br />I note, although Pinker does not address them in great detail, some concommitment trends. At the same time violence is decreasing, our religiosity, fertility and our tribalism are likewise decreasing. We are not fighting wars in the interests of religion because large swaths of humanity no longer believe. We are not fighting for lebensraum because we are not having the children that would be needed in order to populate more territory. In other words, at the same time we're becoming less violent, we're losing some of that zest for evolutionary success which led us to become violent in the first place. We can pray along with Doctor Pinker for a world in which there is increasingly less violence, but we need also pray for one in which the drive for human excellence continues to manifest itself.<br /><br />Afterward: For an excellent review by a professional historian, albeit somewhat more critical than this review, I recommend you google \\"timothy snyder war no more\\".  Snyder is the author of \\"Bloodlands,\\" which I also review favorably here on Amazon.sually by a politician.\\"  For a guy with a long history of writing about evolution, he seems to pretty much avoid its implications in this book.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I am reading and re-reading this book.  It is a how-to course in becoming a successful author in spite of the publishing establishment.<br /><br />Writing is a business like any other.  Kiyosaki says that to be successful in business one of the things you need are systems.  John Locke provides a system for writers to market their products successfully.  It isn't easy, but it is pretty simple.<br /><br />I came to John's book on writing after reading his fiction.  I just finished his latest western, Emmett and Gentry [[ASIN:B005KUJO3Y Emmett & Gentry (an Emmett Love Western)]].  As a life long learner, I can say that the best people to learn from are those who are doing what you want to do, successfully.  John has definitely succeeded as a writer and a marketer.<br /><br />I am trying to apply his techniques right now to my own first publication, a business book on strategic planning for small and one-person businesses [[ASIN:B005QOK3PM Strategic Planning for Very Small Businesses: Using Big Business Tools to Get Big Results for Small Business, Real Estate Entrepreneurs' Edition]].<br /><br />I look forward to John's next book and will likely buy anything he writes.
0312548079|4.0|Something Blue is the sequel to Something Borrowed as all we know, this is story of Darcy and how she has to go through a long path before turning into a better person.<br /><br />After you read a book such as something borrowed you are to think that Darcy was the victim since her best friend stole, yes as she literally took it away, her fiance but the thing is that Darcy wasn't the nicest or good person at all, I always wondered through all the first book how the heck Rachel was a friend with this woman but I guess opposite attracks.<br /><br />In this book at least the 65% of the book Darcy is still the same person, very selfish and manipulative person but after a wake up call from his friend Ethan and realizing that doing a journey to Europe all alone and pregnant she begin to understand that beauty would only help her in some occassions but not always.<br /><br />The first half of the book is kinda slow because is kinda hard not hate Darcy with his behavior and even more when she's pregnant but after having a argument with Ethan were he exploded and told her that she had to change the book made a 360 degree change and beware I'm not saying she's turning to mother Teresa but she does change in a very Darcy way and for me it was quite pleasant.<br /><br />The strongest part at least the one I enjoy more is her relationship with Ethan, it was absolutely sweet, Ethan always knew how to handle Darcy and the dynamic between both was the core of the book.  What enjoyed the most how the author put them together but it wasn't rush we got to savor how their relationship built into something more.<br /><br />Aside from that I like this book because it was not only about Darcy's redemption but also about forgiveness and moving on which was written by the author it didn't seem forced at least to me. That's why for me Giffin is a genius, she doesn't over do stuff.<br /><br />So if you like Something Borrowed you would like Something Blue, it would take you a while to warm up to Darcy but eventually you would see the change and you would enjoy it.ld enjoy it.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I am thrilled with this DVD purchase. It arrived quickly, and in perfect condition.  I love shopping on Amazon.com!!  :)
B005P06AAO|5.0|I love this show! It sorta feels like 2011 version of a mix between Sixteen Candles and Freaks & Geeks. I've heard it is also sort of like a funny version of My So Called Life, but I never watched that show. But, if you like those shows, this definitely is for you. Great combination of just how awkward being a teenager can be, with lots of comedy, and a love triangle that will pull you in a million directions to top it off. I think this show is honest, funny, and pulls you right in. When I watched it as it was airing I couldn't wait for the next week. The writing is amazing and the acting is dead-on. Be careful! You might just watch the whole DVD in one night!!!   Oh, and language and storylines can be very racy, this is NOT a squeaky-clean show.
B000002OTL|3.0|I guess one gets what they pay for. ok I paid a penney for the sound track of pulp fiction.

B004WCTLNY|3.0|I adore Philip K Dick stories, so I was thrilled to see another movie was coming out based on a story he had written. This one was \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" based on \\"Adjustment Team\\". I had high hopes.<br /><br />The storyline is intriguing. Angels, using iPad style devices, are tracking humanity and keeping them \\"adjusted\\" on their proper paths. If someone veers from the path that is set for them, they are nudged back on path. Little changes don't matter, but if someone does a large change, they are fixed.<br /><br />Matt Damon is a man running for New York Senate. He's on a great track for success. However, he gets distracted by an offbeat, funny dancer - played by Emily Blunt. The Adjustment Bureau is Not Happy. They need to get him back on track.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />Normally I like Philip K Dick stories because of the twists and turns in them - but this one lays out almost predictably as a romantic comedy. Guy meets girl. Guy loses girl. Guy meets girl again. Hurdles appear. Guy and girl surmount them and live happily ever after.<br /><br />Even worse, though, it seems really forced. They meet once and kiss, maybe 10 minutes together total. Three years later they meet again on a bus for maybe 10 minutes and separate.  Then I think a year or so later they meet, have a quick lunch, and sleep together. And then he abandons her.<br /><br />So she also has this great guy, Adrian, who adores her. He stands by her. He takes her back after she breaks their engagement. After all of this, David pops back into her life and POOF she runs off with him again and abandons her loyal guy. All because she has a \\"feeling\\" that they were meant to be together.<br /><br />That disturbs me a lot. With all the studies about how those feelings often ride on things like eye dilation and time-of-the-month hormones and so on, do we really want to be telling people to abandon loyal, trusting boyfriends because they have an urge to kiss a guy they've never seen before?<br /><br />Plus, it doesn't feel like a Philip K Dick story at all. There are no real twists. Things don't always make sense. Why would an angel break all the rules to help them? Why do plans just suddenly 'change'? The ending message felt extremely forced.<br /><br />So I was disappointed.r />Plus, it doesn't feel like a Philip K Dick story at all. There are no real twists. Things don't always make sense.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Can't stop playing. Deceptively simple, as the best puzzlers always are. A steal at the price and highly recommended, even if, like me, you aren't typically a fan of the genre.
B004IDG97S|4.0|This action film starring Sylvester \\"Rocky Rambo\\" Stallone is a pretty decent movie which also stars Diane Lane and Armand Assante. I don't know anything about Judge Dredd, other than he's supposedly a comic book character and he never shows his face or whatever. I liked this film, but my issue with it is Rob Schneider. Did he HAVE TO BE in this movie? Seriously, all the guy knows how to do is raunchy comedy ala Adam Sandler. He was okay in \\"Around The World In 80 Days,\\" but that was a Disney movie and everyone knows you can't get raunchy in a Disney film. I recommwend this movie. Good action scenes. Could have been longer, though, with additional character development of Judge Dredd and Judge Hershey and maybe even a romance between both of them.
B005NQ94LM|4.0|I have not yet seen the blu-ray. I just saw the movie in theatres. Many times. But I am anxiously awaiting the blu-ray release. It looks like the blu-ray will have all the featurettes available on the film's official web site, as well as deleted scenes. I can't tell what the aspect ratio will be. I'm hoping it won't be letterbox, and that it will fill up the whose screen on an HD flat screen.<br /><br />If you've read the book, you know this is not a typical happily-ever-after Hollywood romance a la The Notebook. But that is one of the things I love most about it. It has a real, genuine feel to it. Emma, serious-minded, nerdy, wise-cracking and adorable in her insecurity, and Dex, a privileged cad who goes through women like kleenex, are two young people who officially meet on the day they graduate from University, after Emma has crushed on Dex from afar. Their romance was not meant to get off the ground that day, however. But the seeds are sown for a long and abiding friendship that lasts for the next 20 years. We get to check in on what's going on with them one day a year, the anniversary of the day they met. The relationships, not just between Em and Dex, but between Dex and his parents, his wife, his child, Emma's relationship with Ian, and how they each grow through these relationships, are the real heart of this movie. It's really about two ordinary lives in progress, which lends credence to the notion that everyone has an interesting story to tell. Unlike most romances, the main question of the movie is not \\"will they get together/stay together\\" but rather \\"how does their love for each other color the decisions they make and help them through the ups and downs of their individual lives?\\" and most importantly, \\"was it all worth it?\\" As the last scene fades, we know the answer to the last question is a resounding \\"of course it was.\\"<br /><br />In my opinion, most of the criticism thrown at this movie was simply groundless. 1)Anne Hathaway's accent. It's not Gwyneth Paltrow flawless, but it's serviceable and doesn't detract from the story. 2) Anne's character Emma is bland. I see this criticism basically from men. I guess they mean she's not \\"hot.\\" She's not. She's not supposed to be. She's pretty, but is a bit of a late bloomer. She's smart, spunky, insecure, a three-dimensional character with a soul to soul connection with Dex. That's what keeps them together. 3) Dex is unsympathetic. He's a spoiled playboy who gets lost, as some overprivileged people do, but finds his way back. He creates many of his own problems, but is a good person. We can see that he is underneath it all, the same way his mother does. It's seeing how he grows into the man she knows he can be that is part of the movie's charm and impact. 4) No chemistry between the leads. Uh, there were times when I actually felt heat coming off the screen. Jim Sturgess was also convincing and stunning as Dex and does an amazing job not only aging but maturing Dex and showing his emotional growth. I thought I developed a crush on Jim when I saw him in Across The Universe. But this movie takes it to a whole new level.<br /><br />The editing is the one weak spot in this movie. Some of the early scenes feel a bit truncated, leaving a few later scenes feeling a bit unexplained. It doesn't flow quite as nicely as Scherfig's last film, An Education. But the story is much more engaging and entertaining, and the characters are much more likeable and relatable.<br /><br />All in all, I found it to be a very satisfying romance whose ending is very life affirming, and it left me with a swelling in my heart, a smile on my face and a little tear in my eye all at the same time.less, but it's serviceable and doesn't detract from the story. 2) Anne's character Emma is bland.

030726999X|5.0|The book arrived quickly, was in good shape, and was a great price.  I'm happy with my purchase.  You can tell the book is used, but it's still in really good shape..and I don't care if it used..I'm just going to read it and throw on the shelf.
034552554X|5.0|Victoria's life has been nothing if not consistent. Moving from one home to the next became a way of life for her until she met Elizabeth, but it's hard to break a pattern as consistent as the one Victoria's been on her whole life. After living with Elizabeth for longer than any other her life changes dramatically, she's back in homes and eventually ends up on her own. When she's suddenly reunited with someone from her past Victoria's forced to face the decisions of her past and hopefully begin a healing process that should have begun years before.<br /><br />This was a book I wanted to read from the first time I heard about it. When Chloe from the site  I review at reviewed this novel just over a month ago and fell in love with it I couldn't help but want to learn more. After seeing the video that Vanessa Diffenbaugh did regarding her own experience with foster children I felt compelled to pick up this novel as soon as I possibly could and I wasn't disappointed. Not only was it a story I simply couldn't put down it was also one that gave me hope and has inspired me to hopefully do more for others. It's amazing!<br /><br />Victoria was an incredible character. The way in which her story was told made it nearly impossible to stop reading about her journey. I'd find myself saying I'd only read one more chapter and end up stopping five chapters after that. Told from her past and her present situation you get to know where she came from as well as what she's going through to put together the pieces of her shattered life. It's hard to believe that anyone could recover from being left out in the cold all night simply because they were hungry enough to consider eating dog food as a child, but it did happen to her. It was so unbelievably sad and I couldn't help wondering if there wasn't something I could do to prevent all of this.<br /><br />Not only was the story compelling from Victoria's point of view, but the romance between her and the young man from the flower market was wonderful. I loved how they interacted through the language of flowers and how Victoria's own version soon became a way for her to inspire others. The hope that she gave to people through her floral arrangements was a huge way for her to move forward with her life, not only financially but mentally as well. She felt accomplished by helping and connecting with others in a way she never had before.<br /><br />This is simply a novel that must be read! The Language of Flowers by Vanessa Diffenbaugh is a gorgeous story about a girl who has been damaged by years of neglect and heartbreak, but is able to recover. This is a story that slowly works it's way into your heart, grabbing hold and never letting go. Diffenbaugh has created a place and a setting you know exists, though it shouldn't, and a hope for better tomorrows for the young Victoria.

0670022411|1.0|I read the rave reviews and heard about this book on a the radio... so I thought I would give it a try... I purchased the audio version... but perhaps I made a mistake... maybe  reading it would have made it seem less boring and the dialogue less trite... if I heard one more mon coeur....I think I would have screamed....  I felt like half the book could have been eliminated and this was while I was only  1/2 way thru... there was sooo much duplication and making sure that we understood about her 'powers' .... I wanted to yetlll I get it I get it!!  then when I realized I'd read an entire book only to find it was a preamble to another book.....I felt cheated and used... just ridiculous....there was NO book here... just a story line....    but the corker was... both the witch and her vampire lover just took off all over the place while their jobs and responsibilities at Oxford just seemed to fade away....HELLO!!  Ms. Harkness - ever had a real job??  there is NO way that this prestigious super vampire with this international reputation could possibly have left his job... and if I was Oxford I would have been furious with the witch for not fulfilling her commitments... come on.... you don't just leave everything and everyone behind...  maybe I could have gotten over all that if the story was interesting... but it was dull and a bore... and the heroine is a weak sappy not very inquisitive, not very interesting,  type female as well as being an idiot..don't waste your money... I will not be purchasing the rest of the 'trilogy'  shudders  this is when someone says... I could write a better story than that!!
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This was a great book; I wish Hallmark Movies would pick it up (they'd have to curb the cussing, though). This is a sweet, funny story about secrets, lies, honesty and what it takes to really get to know a person.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|i enjoyed this movie so much that i bought two more for friends and the quility is great .and will be oredering again in future.and it has become my favorite movie.
B00003CXAE|5.0|Technology has surely come along way. Being that this is one of our favorite movies of all time our VHS copy was looking pretty bad. We had watched it numerous times and planned on seeing it many more, but decided it was time for a new copy but on a DVD this time. It was a great choice and we hope to enjoy it many more times in the future. The quality is superb.
B000YPWDSS|5.0|Is this import worth the extra cost vs. the US version?  Definitely yes.  Why?<br /><br />1) Bonus CD:  Wow.  Short (~23 minutes) and sweet.  Really, really, sweet.<br /><br />2) Bonus track: \\"Addicted\\", a melodic, whimsical track added to the album (though you do lose the remixed \\"You Know I'm no Good\\").<br /><br />3) Sound quality: slightly fuller and smoother.<br /><br />4) Booklet: 12 pages (vs. 8), including a half-dozen extra photos.<br /><br />Under normal circumstances, the above factors might not be worth the extra cost (or worth buying this import even if you already own the US version, as I did).  But given Winehouse's tragic early death, it's a worthy upgrade.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Absolutely wonderful album. Adele has such an amazingly soulful voice, she's a true pleasure to listen to.  I didn't think there was a bad track on it.
1594744769|5.0|Very much enjoyed this magical, mysterious story.  Characters came to life in a most amazing way.  Recommend this to anyone looking for an alternate universe.
1609611543|3.0|I thought the author did a good job of implicating modern hybridized wheat products and government pushing of grain-based eating in the explosion of weight management problems for people in recent history.  The story of how wheat was transformed into today's high-yield variety and the nutritional consequences of that was educational and particularly welcome for me because I like knowing why a behavior is being suggested to me.  The recommendation to eliminate wheat seemed like a sound conclusion to me, and well-supported by scientific evidence.  Where I began to have difficulty with the book [and this echoes comments of a few other reviewers] was when the author began to generalize from his well-made case against modern wheat to nearly all other sources of carbohydrates including ancient wheat varieties, gluten-free carbohydrate sources, legumes & fruit.  He fails to cite evidence to support the generalization and I think some of his assertions may be wrong.  He even provides his own anecdotal evidence in support of what I'm saying: he reports experimenting on himself comparing the impact after consuming bread made with eikhorn [an ancient wheat variety] flour versus bread made with modern wheat flour.  The differences were striking, yet he concludes with recommending a diet that would restrict consumption of both and does not justify that conclusion adequately for me.  He does explain briefly why he recommends the restriction of most carbohydrate sources, but he does not support the recommendation to anywhere near the extent of his recommendation to avoid foods made with modern wheat.  I even felt a bit deceived by the title of the book because it promises to be about wheat and ends up being more generally focused on gluten and carbohydrates.  I am not saying that the diet he ends up recommending is unhealthy.  It may not be.  I think it will be difficult for most people to follow consistently for a long time, though.  Modifications that include more carbohydrate from sources other than wheat might work well for many people an give them a diet easier to follow.  [Timothy Ferriss' recommendations for a \\"slow-carb\\" diet using beans and lentils as carb sources in his \\"Four-Hour Body\\" book comes to mind.  There are others who recommend similar approaches.  My own experience tells me these sources do not negatively impact my blood sugar, and I also tolerate spelt flour and sprouted grain products very well.]  This book is worth reading to understand the reasons why consumption of food products made with modern wheat is a bad idea.  When it gets to the parts where the author starts telling you what you should and should not eat, I'd take that with a grain of salt and do some further research.  I'd especially recommend that if you're reading his recommendations and thinking, \\"I could never do that\\", because you may not need to.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Let me start by saying how relieved I was to have very few \\"Cersei\\", \\"Jamie\\", and \\"Brienne\\" chapters in this book. That was the only real upside to this book. Martin's writing is uninspiring and actually rather depressing. No one marries for love, no characters with redeemable qualities seem to survive the fall, and evil has over taken all of the good Westeros had to offer. The twist at the end was too little too late. I've been waiting for 2 books for the story to start recovering, to start the uphill climb from the pits of hell and destruction, and hopefully start to see good overcoming evil. But, this has not been the case. There is just death, hatred, and a constant sense that the evil characters will continue to thrive. I want to see some of good characters find happiness and to see them live to the end of the series. If I hadn't invested so much time in the series, waiting so long for the conclusion, I would not be continuing to read the books. I am only reading on because of the story created in the first 2 novels. This could have been written in a more uplifting way to offer hope and encouragement to the readers. Instead, the words have become meaningless wind.
0811806405|5.0|This book came highly recommended to me and I was not let down. It is extremely practical and comprehensive. I am about halfway through my first classical and all is going well because this book answered questions that I could not find solutions for elsewhere.
0385534639|4.0|Not a 5 star but a strong effort, those who feel the characters are 'cardboard' simply don't get the CIRCUS is the star and the lives of those in it are tied to the CIRCUS.  Wonderful read for long rainy days and yes I can't wait for the movie.  Just can't give 5 stars for a few reasons, I would like to really know WHO the man in grey was, and what happened to Ethan, Lainie and Mme Padva.  Strong debut
B000OVLBF8|4.0|stupid, far-fetched piece of enjoyable fictitious entertainment. The concept of a person selling his or her soul to the devil is very, very old one. I really didn't watch it for that. I hardly ever care where the super hero gets his or her power because it is always make believe any way. I just like the fact that the super hero has super abilities and uses them against the bad guys. That is what I liked about this movie. The special effects were to me believable. Plus I have always liked Nicolas Cage and Sam Ellott. Good super hero movie
B005F6NA56|4.0|As I type this, I have the new Feist album 'Metals' playing for about the 7th time.  The album's beautiful, rustic charms are simply too good to resist at this point.  Folks looking for another 'Mushaboom,' or '1,2,3,4' may be disappointed, but luckily I'm not one of them.  This album's a super chill organic delight by one of the best singers around today.
B004EPZ07U|2.0|I'm not exactly sure why this movie didn't thrill me. I love the genre and I thought the actors all did a fine job. The special effects were nice. Still, the whole experience felt shallow. I think the movie lacked heart. The villians had weak motives and were underdeveloped.  If the bad guys don't matter, its difficult to connect with the heroes.
B001IF9WK0|5.0|I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR WEEKS FOR ANY JAMES BLUNT ITEMS THAT I DID NOT OWN YET.  I CAME ACROSS THIS ONE BY SURPRISE. IT LOOKED TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. I ORDERED IT AND I WAS WONDERFULLY PLEASED.  THE WHOLE TRANSACTION WAS EXCELLENT!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This was a superb retelling of the story.  Dougray Scott played his part well and a charming prince at that.
B005AVIZ6U|1.0|This is the last novel by Lee Child that I will read.  It looks as though he sat down and wrote it after dinner one night. The plot is not as complicated as other novels by Child. The worst part was the detailed description of his sexual encounters with Devereux. They bordered on the pornographic and in my view wasted too many pages, when we could have seen some other action.Just as well that this was not the first novel of Child's I read, because I certainly would not have read another one, and missed out on the later and better novels.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|From the bar band playing the cantina music from star wars to the Aliens references, this movie has it all.  Funny flick, Great price!  Awesome seller!  Highly reccomend!
B000MV8AE0|5.0|\\"Copying Beethoven\\" is a must have movie for any serious (or even casual) fan of classical music. It deals with Beethoven as he is finishing up writing his 9th symphony and preparing for its debut preformance. Ed Harris is given the roll of playing Beethoven. Having to play such a larger then life role as Beethoven must be a challenge for any actor but if it is Harris is up to it. His performance in this film is one of his best in his acting career. Diane Kruger plays Anna, a young lady who applies for the job as Beethovens' copiest. She is interested in a career in music and working for the great mestro would be a hugh plus for her to learn about composing music. Beethoven is at first opposed to such an idea as having a woman as a copiest but soons relents when he sees she has a true love for music and knows what she is doing. Soon the great Ludwig comes dependant on her and values her judgement and friendship. Whether or not Diane Krugers' character really existed in real life is unsure but Beethovens' depiction in the movie at this point in his life is pretty much accurate. Agnieszka Holland is the director of this film and the time and effort she put in to creating 18th century Vienna is masterful. The true moment of beauty in the film is her brilliant creation of the concert hall and performance of the premier of the 9th symphony. This film I think could go on to become known as Hollands' masterpiece in her career.
B004SHED22|5.0|I fell in love with this story. My heart broke for Sarah and her family. I was so disturbed about Sarah's brother, I could not stop thinking about him. I thought the author did a wonderful job telling this story through the eyes of a little girl - her innocent naivete during the roundup was sweet and heartbreaking. While I hate knowing that for someone, this story was very real, I did enjoy seeing Sarah develop and become, while still a young child, a woman who was hardened, determined to survive and determined to find her little brother. I thought the author's characterization of Sarah was impeccable.   I also liked the dual story of Julia. I loved the intensity in which Julia threw herself into researching her story, finding Sarah and then Sarah's son. I hated Julia's husband. I know that the point was to hate him, but I hated that his character had to even be written. His overall personality, his lack of support for Julia's life and career, and his attitude towards the baby were all so awful. I wish the author could have written Julia a better husband. He did not have one redeeming quality, except for being really good looking, it was very hard for me to understand why Julia was with him, and why she refused to leave him, even though the author mentions numerous times how everyone she knows thinks he stinks.  Anyway, I am looking forward to seeing this movie. I can't wait to see Sarah come to life.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Everyone my age remembers when this movie came out. We grew up with this movie, and like Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, it's a shimmering example of Disney's in the 90s renaissance. Chances are if you are looking at this review, you have already seen this movie, and you only have one question on your mind: does the Blu-Ray look good? I can answer this with a resounding YES. Every line jumps off of the screen with pixel-perfect clarity, amazing color, and not a hint of film grain or dirt anywhere. Your jaw will drop like it did when you first saw this movie, not only because of the brilliant transfer, but also because of the timeless charm of this film's animation. Even in today's age of ritzy CG films, movies like The Lion King stand testament to the power of 2D drawings on film, and I am very glad to know that this film is finally available in a format that truly does justice to the beatuful artwork that it is comprised of.<br /><br />This disc also has a respectable (though hardly exhaustive) suite of bonus features. It is not as in-depth as some of the stuff you'll find on Pixar's DVDs but it is still an enjoyable retrospective that will give you a new appreciation for this film's quality. For example: did you know that Disney's executives thought The Lion King was going to be a dud, and that Pocahontas was going to be their biggest hit ever? That amusingly ironic factoid is one of many you'll learn if you take a look at the extra features on the disc.<br /><br />In short, go out and buy it this Blu-ray. It's amazing, and worth every penny it will cost to add to your home library.

1439153663|2.0|I do not comprehend all the five star reviews for this novel. It had some redeeming qualities but on the whole it was like a run on soap opera with all the things that come with that genre.........Rape, incest,drugs,polygamy, stereotypical villians, and too good to be true heroes. I never got a real feel of the history of the time in this novel. There were some aspects that held my interest but on the whole it did not work for me.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|This story owned me from the start.  The opening line hooked me and the characters held me in their world until the conclusion.  Maybe this was because I related so much to Abby, and Travis seemed to be based upon my husband.  Whatever the reason, I couldn't put the book down, especially in the middle of the character's conflict.  There's no way I could have slept!  I had to finish the book before going to bed, and was very pleased with the ending.
0385523394|4.0|I enjoyed this well-written memoir by Piper Kerman.  It covers more than just her 13 months in a women's prison.  The book starts with college and post-college years as Kerman tries to establish how exactly she became enmeshed in a drug-running scheme.  She never cops to being duped or misunderstood...just to being someone who made a series of questionable, incremental decisions and poor judgments that added up.  She fully admits to that.  Years later, to her great shock, the FBI knocks on her door.  Somewhere, a canary has sung.  Kerman will pay a price.<br /><br />Next, she recounts an excruciating, years-long purgatory in which only she and boyfriend, Larry, know that a federal prison sentence awaits over the horizon.  In my opinion, that part is the book's strongest material. By the time she's sentenced, its a full decade after the events that led to her arrest.<br /><br />In prison, Kerman's book excels at painting a picture of daily prison life - the friendships, routines and diversions that make the time go by.  Midway through her stint she observes that she feels that she's \\"hit a groove, and the days and the weeks seemed to go faster.\\"  It's no coincidence that a reader I felt like I was in a groove at that point, too.<br /><br />The book is aptly titled.  More than a funny, ha-ha on orange prison garb, it's a sly way at making note of the rising number of women in prison.  Kerman's \\"Afterword to the Paperback Edition\\" notes that the US has 5% of the world's population, but 25% of its prisoners....and that in 30 years, we've gone from 800,000 to 2.3 million prisoners with women making up a good portion of the growth.<br /><br />The book's only disappointment - noted by others on these pages - is the brief ending.  Kerman's storytelling and likable personality had won an opportunity with me (and I'm sure with countless others) to tell us in many pages about her post-prison activities...days of celebration, reunion and beyond.  Alas, there's only a couple of paragraphs.  I would have been willing to read much more.  [Even the paperback's Afterword doesn't have a lot more to say.]to read much more.

0316056863|1.0|I'm very liberal and I watch both SNL and 30 Rock every single week so when I heard about this I thought Great! something to make me laugh and distract me in what have been some pretty stressful times lately.  What I got instead was a book of whining about her babysitter, some of her co-workers, her fat, her looks, her ratings, how she doesn't have enough time to spend with her kid, how Internet people write snarky things about her sometimes, how she doesn't get to keep wardrobe after photo shoots and on and on and on.  The thing she never tells you though, but which you can learn from websites in position to know is that she pulls down not 1 million, not 2 million, not 4 million, but 8 MILLION DOLLARS a year!  That's not just once like with a lottery ticket, but every single year! She may well be over 20 or 30 million by now. And yet she's either too stupid or too cheap to throw any of it at these problems.  Meanwhile in the book she's STILL constantly begging us to buy her DVDs and episodes on iTunes! When does it ever stop? Do we have to sign over even our meager bank accounts to make her happy?  Really? So many of us are just trying to win an audition or get a book published or even get just a few hits on our blog, but here she gets 8 megabucks per annum and makes us listen to her whine about it. Maybe once she was an authentic mensch, but it seems she's just turned into another one of those limousine types she hangs out with all the time.  She even complains, if you can believe it, that she can't quit her job because 200 people will lose their jobs. Believe me, there are hundreds ready to take on that burden if you would just get out of the way. Buy this book if you need a good purging because it made me retch.
030746363X|5.0|I've always been in \\"good\\" (180 lb, 20% body fat) shape and never really considered going on a strict diet but Tim's out of the box ideas are what got my attention at first.  I'm an engineer by trade so the data behind Tim's method is what hooked me.  I've only been going at it for a little over a week now but I already see some results.  If nothing else it's an easy and interesting read and anybody can pick at least one or two tips out of this book.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ok, this my first ever review which should tell you that I liked this book enough to break out of my shell.  As a product of the Eighties (Class of 86) I totally got this book.  Great premise, great plot, great writing.  I wasn't sure about this book at first, but before I knew it I was hooked.  I won't say anymore than this to avoid spoilers, but this one brought back memories... and you don't have to be an uber-geek to enjoy it, I wasn't.  Just so you know, the author was the screenwriter for Fanboys and is prepping the screenplay for a movie based on the book.  Knowing this now, I am ordering the hardcopy for my son after reading it on my Kindle, I hope that this book becomes one of his favorites from his teen years.
B003EV6DBM|2.0|I didn't care much for Russell T. Davies' vision of Doctor Who - but the guy was, at least, progressive. He successfully dragged the show into the 21st century by giving it a (somewhat) convincing urban setting, and making the cast racially and sexually diverse. And while I was disappointed in his version of Doctor Who for its soap opera stylings and poor science fiction content, I could at least understand why it was popular.<br /><br />With this season, the \\"showrunner\\" switched from Davies to Steven Moffat, the creator of \\"Coupling.\\" Many fans - including myself - expected Moffat to come riding in like the cavalry and make Doctor Who a cool, gothic, real science fiction show again. Alas, in the end, Moffat brings nothing to the table but nostalgia. Unlike the progressive Davies, he presents an all-Caucasian cast that hangs out in a quaint (that is, unreal) English country village - hurling the show's sensibilities back in time about 50 years. And also unlike Davies, who could at least write comprehensible scripts, Moffat loses himself in convoluted, nerdy plots that are heavy on continuity and alienating to casual viewers; note that this is exactly the kind of writing that doomed the original Doctor Who back in the 1980s.<br /><br />And there are many other flaws in this season, apart from the writing. Matt Smith is clearly miscast as the Doctor, and his age has nothing to do with it; he simply doesn't project intelligence, or any kind of gravitas. Indeed, the defining trait of his Doctor is a goofy sense of humor that rarely proves to be funny. From his irritating catchphrase (\\"bow ties are cool\\") to his frivolous observation that Vincent van Gogh's children would be \\"the ultimate ginge,\\" Smith makes a range of stupid comments that drag down the character's IQ about fifty points. Is this really the same man who used to boast of hanging out with Chairman Mao, and who used to say things like \\"your species has the most amazing capacity for self-deception, matched only by its ingenuity when trying to destroy itself\\"?<br /><br />The production values are yet another source of disappointment here. Anyone who thinks the new Doctor Who has a huge budget ought to carefully examine the scene in which the new Daleks - which resemble giant fire hydrants painted in gaudy colors - emerge from a swirl of dry ice, into a \\"spaceship\\" set that resembles a factory basement (which is probably what it was). Only a few episodes here, like the unusually strong Weeping Angel two-parter, manage to achieve the cinematic, Pan's Labyrinth-style look that the production team was going for.<br /><br />In short, this version of Doctor Who is nothing but nostalgic silliness - a kitsch re-imagining of a superior old show that was cheesier but smarter. The Davies version of the show, for all its glaring flaws, at least felt like something *new* in addition to being nostalgic. The Moffat vision is a step backward. If Doctor Who ever gets another showrunner, I don't want it to be another geeky fan who loves the original series and views the whole enterprise through a rose-tinted haze; I want to show to be written by a sharper, less nostalgic writer who isn't afraid to make the Doctor brilliant again and to cast a somewhat tougher actor in the role (Jason Isaacs? Idris Elba?) Anything, to me, would be preferable to watching a goofball Doctor confront a tangerine-colored Dalek in a basement...
B004HGBUVG|5.0|Blessed is powerful, sad, rough-hewn,and of our times.  As always, Williams is unflinching as she explores tragic situations and depths of emotion most other people avoid at all cost. In what must be the most poignant song in the collection,  Williams sings in the quivering, tight, frightened voice of a dying soldier imagining his life back home.  It is not a heroic reflection, but rather a real and human call to the world that all is not right.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|I'm not going to go into the review on the movie itself but of how I made the movie cheaper. I told my mother I was going to buy this movie and she wanted the dvd.  So she paid for half of the movie and I gave her the dvd copy since she didn't have a bluray player.  As for traveling put the digital copy on your portable player and feed it into the travel tv displays.  So if you find someone to go halfs or even split it 3 ways if you have another person in the family the movie could be cheap for all.  The movie is one that will be watched more than once in fact my 2 boys (3 and 5yrs old) have seen it about 20 times now.
0670022411|5.0|This ia a compelling story story that will capture the attention of readers that enjoy fiction, romance and mystery.  It is a tale that left me hoping this is the start of another series involving witches, vampires and demons and that I won't have to wait too long for the next book.

0307877523|1.0|This diet recommends eating mainly meat.  Meat production is not only detrimental to the planet, but causes the body to become highly acidic.  Acid leaches minerals out of one's bones which eventually results in osteoporosis.  Also, eating high quantities of meat causes one to have body odor and bad breath, making it difficult for other people to be around that person.

B004SBS8LA|4.0|Although I have yet to even play it once, my 6th grade son loves it. Not exactly music to a mother's ears. However, it makes mornings easier since he can only play it once he's ready for school. The movie &amp; music totally played a big part in this version over the regular one.

B000006IUQ|1.0|Ok, let's be honest. People vote on these \\"helpful\\" reviews usually based on whether they agree with the reviewer's general opinion of the film. Well then strap yourself in to not agree with mine baby!<br /><br />There is quite a bit of pleasant scenery in this move. And then there is a ridiculously contrived plot about a bear stalking these two poor (well one rich) men in the wilderness. Thrown into the action, is a lot of money/sex/power chatter, treated in a typical Hollywood way. I would say \\"liberal\\" but that's too easy. And also, Mamet has moved over to the dark side lately although not sure if he was of the libertarian mind when he wrote this. Anyway, I love his work and can't quite understand what happened here.<br /><br />An apology for the rich guy. And forgiveness for the poor jealous guy too. The whole thing tries to be some sort of god-awful morality play about nothing. It's like a hippy version of Howard Roark vs a cooler, more evil Peter Keating. Lovely.<br /><br />The director and writer forgot all about Hitchcock's \\"suspension of disbelief\\" concept. I wasn't scared of the bear. I was scared for the bear, because in eating these actors, it might have had to injest part of the film's story and that would be a violation of it's rights, for sure.<br /><br />Honestly, stupid stupid stupid. How's that.<br /><br />The following people found this review helpful...1/100--thank god we live in a republic and not a democracy. 100 people are usually wrong. It only takes one Jefferson to be right! ;)<br /><br />Kisses...

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I used to rent these for our video productions and finally bought a pair few months ago. For the price, you won't find a better set of headphones. There's a reason why so many audio pros still sue these in the field.

B000002UVX|5.0|Recorded on New Years Eve 1969 at The Fillmore East in NYC, with an introduction by the legendary concert promoter Bill Graham,Jimi Hendrix,Buddy Miles and Billy Cox opened this set with the ultra FUNKY jam:\\"WHO KNOWS\\". This is the FUNKIEST live ROCK jam in recorded history period! Jimi displays his skills from the chitlin' circuit days. His riffs are so tight and stanky! Both Jimi's and Buddy's vocals are very soulful as well. This trio really give it up on this album. Buddy's drumming is funky and always on time,and Billy's bass playing is just plain nasty! This was a band that were not only close friends,but were also on the \\"COSMIC ONENESS\\", as a unit. This band,influenced legends like the great; MILES DAVIS(Check out his albums:\\"A TRIBUTE TO JACK JOHNSON\\" and \\"LIVE EVIL\\"),and was the inspiration for acts and bands that followed after such as: FUNKADELIC,PRINCE,FISHBONE,THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS,LIVING COLOUR,24-7 SPYZ, and DIGITAL UNDERGROUND. The music on this album is very progressive and innovating. On the second song; \\"MACHINE GUN\\", Jimi really strecthes his guitar solos with his spacey,jazzy and far-out improvisations. This is a song that will take the listener thru an emotional journey of BLUES and FUNKATIVITY like never before! On; \\"CHANGES\\", an original Buddy Miles song,the band puts together a great display of rock and soul(Although,I like the version on the: \\"live at the fillmore east\\" album better because it's much funkier, with much more bottom in the groove). On; \\"POWER TO LOVE\\", Jimi starts the song with a soulful guitar riff,then tears into an incredible hard rock solo that will make your; \\"BIG TOE SHOOT UP IN YOUR BOOT!\\", as the great Little Richard once said about Jimi's playing. The last two songs; \\"MESSAGE TO LOVE\\" and \\"WE GOTTA LIVE TOGETHER\\", are brilliant as well because THE BAND OF GYPSY's does such a great job of fusing; SOUL,FUNK,ROCK and even a little GOSPEL, into the synchronization of the music. Prior to this recording in the 1960s there wasn't any bands that were doing anything like this in the rock music scene. This is an album that all musicians,avid listeners,collectors and historians must listen to in the: Funk/Hard Rock/Blues/Psychedelic Soul, music genre! I also highly recommend the: \\"live at the fillmore east\\" double album as well because it's also brilliant,creative and really funky as hell! It expands on the rest of the performances on that awesome night of music jamming, and has great songs that are not on the original album such as:\\"Izabella\\",\\"Stepping Stone\\",\\"Stop\\",\\"Burning Desire\\",and two different versions of:\\"Machine Gun\\".  Both of these albums are piece of art.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|The only issue that I had was that they are too short. I wish Bosch had a blog so we could hear from him once a month at least.
1595828095|5.0|This book is perfect!  Great stories, great artwork, beautiful printing, perfect size, interesting introduction, great price, etc. Wrightson's work jumps off the pages.
B0055PMJMW|2.0|Don't agree with other reviewers that these stories are not up to Connelly quality. BUT, these are not merely short, they are micro! Each one is the length of a typical Connelly chapter, so I went through these in minutes.<br /><br />But what really irritates me--and it's not the author's fault--is the misleading product page for this. The title says Three HB Stories, not Short Stories...and the description does not obviously state these are short stories either. So when I pre-ordered these I thought I was getting a great bargain, now, I think I was ripped-off.  C'mon Amazon, you can do better than deceive customers this way.<br /><br />I too canceled my pre-order for the other 3 stories in November.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|My wife purchased this movie and we watched it together. I enjoyed the plot and look forward to seeing the other movies. I would say I am Team Jacob and my wife is definitely Team Edward. The movie was superb!
B005O30Y5Y|4.0|All in all I have to say that this is a fitting end to a great era.  The special effects where phenominal, the acting was supurb, overall a great visual representation of what I believe will become a household name in literature in years to come.  However, there is one thing that bumps me when comparing this movie to the book (and feel free to double check me because I have been wrong before.    ***SPOILER ALERT***  As I remember the end of the book, Harry discusses with Dumbldore's portrait that Harry can keep the invisiblity cloak, the reserection stone would remain where it was dropped in the forbidden forest and the elder wand would be returned to Dumbldore's tomb where its powers would cease if Harry died undefeated.  This is where I have a problem with the movie, it has no visit to Dumbledore's office for conversation and to repair Harry's broken wand, and in the last shot of the movie before the time shift, Harry breaks the elder wand in half and throws it into the wreckage of Hogwarts.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|You know Michael Bay has made some powerful emotional films (The Rock, Armageddon, The Island) where he really developed his characters & made you care about them, the same was true for the first \\"Transformers\\" movie, but when it comes to sequels this guy throws all that out the window, as one reviewer said...\\"he used to be a good director\\"....this one like the second film is nothing but one big CGI fest, whereas the first film had the right balance, the second & this third film is an assault on the senses, Shia LaBouf & Josh Dushammel look bored, Megan Fox's replacement was too superficial to me, like she had come from the Playboy mansion, nothing wrong with her, but Fox seemed more like a real person, John Turtorro who was a blast in the first film is just collecting a paycheck, & Patrick Dempsey & John Malkovich were just embarassing themselves here, I never walk out before a film is over, but did on this in it's last 10 minutes, I just couldn't take the machines endless fights & destruction of Chicago any longer, I mean it just went on & on, I felt like I was watching a video game, the building sequence was about the only cool thing about this whole movie & even then you have to suspend belief a bit, not to mention the bad attempts at humor with the co-worker or the parents, I got to a point where I didn't care who lived or died, yes Michael Bay was a good director past tense!!

1423140591|5.0|I really don't think that I can wait!! This is one of the best books I have read!! I will try not to spoil anything! I got this at six in the morning and finished it at nine at night! I have to say I couldn't really keep track of all the Roman words but I looked in the back of the book at the glossarY! It was REALLY good!! So as everyone knows that in the Lost Hero, they believe that Percy switched places with Jason and is at the Roman camp. The point of views are Percy, Hazel (a Roman camper), and Frank (also a Roman camper.) The book ends with a HUGE cliffhanger, at least to me!<br /><br />DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE STORY SPOILED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />___________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The Argo II shows up in the end and there is a new small prophecy at the end which bothers me because I can't wait that long for the other book, The Mark of Athena (we all know who this is about, don't we!)<br /><br />Here is the prophecy<br /><br />\\"Wisdom's daughter walks alone, the Mark of Athena burns through Rome.\\" We know who this is about again, don't we!!!!<br /><br />Does this prophecy bother you too? I wish I hadn't read it so fast! Hopefully you like it! I would recommend it to anyone!
B005ELZKWS|5.0|It is impressive that at this day and age that such a GREAT rock album can still be made.   In a time where everyone tries so hard and bands take 3, 5, 17 years to release an album, SAM, MIK, CHAD and JOE prove that in RNR less is more. THANKS!!
B0009UC7H0|2.0|At first the movie really feels promising but just after ten minutes through the movie you can see how it's copied past movies so much it's just becomes boring and monotonous lacking anything to keep you from watching the end of the movie.  I felt we would see a new character treasure hunting adventurer seeking a lost treasure,  divining mythical historical puzzles,  or at least having decent historical knowledge but this character has almost next to nothing on any of this.  Another subplot put into the movie is the humanitarian female lead trying to save something or someone played by Penelope Cruz whose own lack luster acting made a boring movie even worse to watch,  I mean for all the hype that was given to her while the movie was made her emotional acting in it was atrocious.  Also how can we have a movie like this without the humorous sidekick Steve Zahn which again the actor picked just made you turn the movie off instead of having to watch this garbage through to the end.  If you're looking for a good treasure hunting action movie try out the Indiana Jones or National Treasures movies those at least give you the characters you will enjoy and a storyplot that will keep you entertained unlike this sad mistake that was made and which I truly wish I had not force myself to watch and can hopefully forget about soon...

B0053FP1PQ|3.0|I was a bit dissapointed with Junk.  While every band should mature and evolve with each record, it felt a bit forced on this one.  For the most part, gone are the racous guitar riffs and rock songs; in are the strings, horns, synth, keyboards, and love songs.  It works pretty well on some songs, but in general just makes some of the songs not feel like Kooks songs at all.  Junk of the Heart(Happy), Rosie, and Eskimo Kiss are the most \\"Kooks sounding\\" songs on the record, and not coincidentally, are 3 of the strongest 4 songs on the album, the other being Mr. Nice Guy - which is a departure sonically, but is a bit edgier and the synth and piano really work well here.  How'd you like that, F**K the world off, Run Away, Is it Me, and Petulia are all good songs that any real Kooks fan will end up liking after a few spins, but certainly are not some of the stronger songs the guys have written.  Taking Pictures of You, Time Above the Earth, and Killing Me just do not sound like Kooks songs at all.  Taking Pictures sounds like it could be a Maroon 5 song on top 40 radio.  Time Above the earth has the potential to be a nice diddy if it were done with an acoustic guitar or straight piano, but the strings really seem forced and just add too many layers.  Killing me is just a bad song and has a synth verse peice that makes is sound like Toto's \\"Africa\\".  It just doesn't belong on the album and I'm not sure what Producer Tony Hoffer was thinking here.  If you buy the album in either Europe or the Asia, it comes with 2 bonus tracks: Carried Away and The Saboteur.  Carried Away belongs on the record proper and sounds more like a Kooks song than half the songs that made it on the record do.  The Saboteur is a hard edge, piano/synth driven tune akin to No More Mr. Nice Guy.  Really a great song and also would have been a nice addition to the record proper.  All in all a decent album, but unless your a really big Kooks fan, you may want to just download the good songs I mentionedabove and skip some of the filler. Hopefully they return to more of a guitar driven indie/classic rock sound for their 4'th album.
0440244412|5.0|Where do I start. I have read every single book she has written. I started with the Fever series and moved on to the highland series. When I start one of her books I can't stop reading till I have finished the entire book it is worse then Godiva (less calories) :)<br />If you love suspense, mystery, magic and a bit of spice then her books are the best by far. I don't want to spoil the story line for anyone so I say this if you have a iPad get a sample; if you have a library borrow and decide for yourself.
B005F908UI|5.0|This is no 'Homogenic' or 'Vespertine', but you have to admit this album is amazing! 'Virus' is probably the sweetest song I've heard in a really long time, and 'Mutual Core' is incredibly orgasmic! Probably the best song on the album! This album has the best theme and lyrics I have ever experienced, simply gorgeous! I know this won't get Bjork many new fans, but us already fans will find this masterpiece pretty delightful, unlike 'Volta'! That being said... Damn it, amazon! Why do you offer stuff to pre-order if you don't even have it? Not cool at all!

B004ZNARH4|1.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2JZLQRF4LL0WI]]Well, before I start my review, allow me to preface it with some self-indulgent observations about myself, just to give you an idea of the level of my disgust.<br /><br />I am no casual fan of Pink Floyd.<br />They are far and away my favorite band of all time.<br />Bought all of their official music THREE TIMES OVER NOW, first on vinyl or cassette, then the first run of CDs, then the remastered CDs.<br />Bought and still own all the very little official audio/visual material available that has anything to do with them, Pompeii, The Wall, the London 66-67 footage, The 14-Hour Technicolor Dream, the Classic Albums Dark Side documentary.<br />I also have well over 200 \\"unofficial\\" pieces from them.<br />The only reason I bother mentioning that is to give you an idea of just how much this band means to me as one of those somewhat mentally unbalanced superfans.<br />I'm one of those people so well versed on this band's history that I knew for years they were holding some material that was practically crying out for a proper release, biding my time (see if you get that little joke) until the day they finally put it into our hands.<br /><br />Well, here is what happened to me.<br /><br />1) Pre-ordered and eagerly awaited my set as soon as my tracking number came through.<br />  I could hardly contain my excitement when I peaked out the window to see it waiting on my porch.<br />  Imagine my disappointment when I opened it, only to discover that two of the four disks in the bottom of the box were loose, and BADLY scratched.<br />  Just to be sure these weren't just cosmetic scratches, I attempted to play them, and (sure enough) they were unplayable.<br />  For those of you playing at home, Disk 1 and Disk 3 were scratched.<br /><br />2) Called Amazon, very upset about this problem, and the CSR was very sympathetic and apologetic (although this was NOT an Amazon packaging issue), arranging for a return form and a replacement.<br />  This time, following the advice from fellow fans to hang onto the first set in the hopes of doing a mix-and-match should there be any damage in this second set, I hung onto the first set to do that just in case.<br />  Set number two arrives at my door.<br />  Once again with great excitement, but this time tempered with wariness, I carefully opened the box, only to discover that THREE of the four disks in the bottom of the box were loose, with two badly scratched.<br />  For those of you playing at home, Disk 2 and Disk 3 were scratched, so I couldn't even do a mix-and-match with the first set!<br /><br />3) Since set number two arrived so badly damaged, I called Amazon once again, this time barely able to contain my fury at the shoddy packaging from the manufacturer.<br />  I still have the first two sets, hoping to do a mix-and-match in case of damage with this one.<br />  This was yesterday.<br />  Once again, the CSR was very sympathetic and courteous, arranging yet ANOTHER replacement.<br />  This time, Amazon actually overnighted it to me.<br />  I opened it only hours ago...and...ALL FOUR DISKS IN THE BOTTOM WERE LOOSE, two of which are badly scratched.<br />  Guess which of the two was scratched this time?<br />  Oh yes, Disk 3!<br />  I STILL can't even do a mix-and-match!<br /><br />The problem is that the four disks in the bottom of the box are sitting on spindles only, with the only thing restraining them being the booklets and other trinkets they come with.<br />They could have prevented this with a simple piece of form fitting corrugated cardboard over the disks, but (apparently) they thought that would be too much trouble or expense.<br />Looking at the packaging, my observation is that they fell in with the whole \\"green packaging\\" fad instead of ensuring there would be no damage to the disks themselves.<br />But at least the cheap marbles were individually bubble wrapped.<br />It's a good thing all the extraneous trinkets - those marbles, the postcards, the booklets, the scarf - are all in flawless condition.<br />Didn't we all buy this for the trinkets, intending to discard the disks immediately?<br />I have now given up entirely.<br />EMI/Capitol blew it.<br />Pink Floyd blew it.<br /><br />And I happen to know a dozen or so who are equally irked.<br />And there are doubtless hundreds or thousands out there who soon will be.<br />If this was the best they could do, they should never have even bothered.<br />Great job, guys.<br />You just majorly infuriated a lifelong hard core fan.<br />Good luck winning me over again after flipping me off like this.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />Well, not completely surrendering to the problems just yet, I went into a major \\"brick and mortar\\" retail outlet, where they had one on the shelf.<br />I asked to open it at the counter, and (sure enough) one disk was dislodged and scratched.<br />Ho hum...<br />Just yesterday (09OCT11), I went into another major retailer, where they said they had one on the shelf.<br />Again, opened it at the counter, and Disk 3 (what is it with that particular disk?) was dislodged and scratched.<br />Shrugging my shoulders in resignation, I prepared to get rung up for a simple refund, when the young lady in sales offered to take me over to the shelf to check and see if another might just be there.<br />At first, we couldn't see one at all, and we were just about to give up, when I spotted one on the floor under the racks there, almost invisible.<br />I picked it up, and back to the counter we went.<br />Knowing that the previous five sets were damaged, I opened it and found that ALL FOUR DISKS were securely fastened down and completely unscathed.<br />Ditto for the two in the slipcases.<br />After all this trouble, I finally found an intact set.<br />I still believe the quality control problems with the packaging are inexcusable, but maybe now I can add another update reviewing the content itself, once I've had a chance to listen to it properly.<br /><br />***UPDATE 08NOV2011***<br />Okay, after (finally) having purchased my first Blu-Ray player to enjoy the full content of this set, I can at last comment on the quality of the recordings.<br /><br />Disk 1 is yet another remaster, and I already have the first edition remaster of DSotM, the Mobile Fidelity gold disk remaster, and the 2003 SACD, so it's really tough for me to make a definitive statement on this remaster's merits relative to those three already fantastic disks.<br /><br />Disk 2 is definitely something to enjoy, the complete Dark Side from two nights at Wembley Empire Pool, the beginning through \\"The Great Gig...\\" being from 16NOV74, and \\"Money\\" through the end being from the 15th.<br />Fantastic performance, better than ever heard before on the widely circulated BBC recording from the 16th exclusively.<br />I gather that this still required considerable edits (dubbed in kick drum because Nick's kit wasn't properly mic'd on the original tape) and various other tricks to make a just okay recording sound fantastic.<br />I especially liked Dave's extra bit of pedal steel on \\"The Great Gig...\\"<br />Keep in mind that this is only the Dark Side set, and it lacks \\"Echoes,\\" \\"You Gotta Be Crazy,\\" \\"Raving and Drooling,\\" and \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond,\\" which were also performed during the original gigs, however the latter three are included on the WYWH Immersion Set.<br /><br />Disk 3 is a standard DVD consisting of audio only that includes the original quadraphonic (4.0) and 5.1 (2003) mixes in Dolby Digital (lossy), and the LPCM stereo recording in full lossless (16-bit 48KHz) PCM.<br />For some oddball reason, they chose to include two each of the 5.1 and 4.0 mixes, one in 448KBPS and the other in 640KBPS, something I have since learned was done to allow playback for those with older DVD players.<br />This was probably a good idea to allow those with a 5.1 setup and any standard DVD player to enjoy the full surround experience, but we all know that full LPCM surround is a much more attractive option, which is covered beyond all doubt.<br /><br />Disk 4 is a video DVD that contains several of the screen backdrop films (not of the band! just what was projected on \\"Mr. Screen\\" during their performances), the 2003 Enhanced Press Kit video explaining the 2003 SACD remix, and the well known and widely circulated in \\"unnofficial\\" circles Peter Whitehead footage of \\"Careful with that Axe, Eugene\\" and \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" shot at Brighton Dome.<br />You also get a very nice little Easter egg if you select the 2003 EPK, then wait a moment for a prism to appear, then click on it, which will give you (nearly...they edited out the part where Roger Waters asks Roger the Hat for some of what he was smoking at the time) the complete interview Roger Waters did with Roger the Hat for some of the more memorable spoken word bits intermingled throughout DSotM, such as \\"Here for today, gone tomorrow, that's me...hahaha!\\" and \\"They're gonna kill ya, so you give 'em a short, sharp

B003L77G6A|5.0|It came on time and I was able to see where my package was the entire time. Amazon is the best company to buy from.
B001HTLKCU|5.0|This Blu-ray of \\"TAKE THAT\\" was a big surprise to me. This Blu-ray is currently the most watched in my house for the whole family. Great sound, beautiful songs, great performance from all the boys, simply spectacular stage effects, very good picture. It is a purchase that I recommend to all people of good taste with a good audio system and video in their homes. The dancers are really beautiful and sexy, this is true, but still worth every penny I paid for it. This Blu-ray, along with \\"The Circus Live,\\" both of \\"Take That\\" are two completely different shows from all the 150 Blu-rays of my collection, almost all purchased on amazon.com.
1559210400|5.0|I picked this book up as a library discard at a used book sale.  I had read several other books written by Pearl S. Buck, so I knew I would appreciate the writing style.  Reading this book in relation to China's role in today's world; I am awed at the author's insightfulness.  A good book will remain a good book over time.
B001H32E6W|5.0|I am really glad I found this book, especially in ebook format. Can't beat the price for an informative and useful book!
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|Product arrived intact and on time, viewed movie and found it quiet entertaining.  Never saw a movie focused on an elevator before.  I am happy with my purchase.
1612930441|5.0|Just adding my two cents to a list of great reviews.<br /><br />I love British literature, and Oscar Wilde is a lot of fun.  I read this book fairly quickly, it seemed that the text flowed well and the subject matter and characters held my interest.  It is a lovely novel about vanity and envy.  The message may have been written long ago, but it still holds merit today.<br /><br />And without giving anything away, you will be surprised at many points in this novel.  Pleasantly of course.
B00338QENI|5.0|I think this book is important especially for college students or for anyone interested in medical science and ethics, the history of race relations in the United States, or simply interested in the human side of the story: the heart-wrenching and sometimes terrifying story of a family seeking answers and justice. I don't think I simply bought this book. I think it followed me home. I think it wanted to be read. I know that sounds strange but this book gave me such eerie chills that I think there must be some kind of spirit connected with it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have enjoyed this game quite a bit. More than I thought I would. Works great without any problems droid x.
B002JVWQSW|2.0|I heard a lot of good things about this one but found the humor mediocre almost like it was dumbed down for the generic masses. By the second episode I lost interest. I did feel the backgrounds were interesting but more humor would have helped a great deal.<br /><br />WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; HUMOR: D minus; MY GRADE: C to C plus.
B002KREVCO|5.0|Llego todo bien. Excelente producto y de muy buena calidad. gracias por todo.  Espero que tengan mas de estos cd.
0062060554|5.0|Christine wakes every morning with no memory of the previous day, the week before, and without even a solid memory of her family and friends. She wakes up to realize that she doesn't recognize her husband or the woman that she has obviously become, and that waking up with no memory is a daily occurrence for her. And then she finds a journal that she has secretly been writing in which leads her to realize that her life isn't what it seems....<br /><br />Wow! This was a thriller that didn't let me go until the very last page. From the very beginning of the book, I was drawn into it because the main character, Christine, realizes that the life she doesn't know or remember isn't exactly as it should be. And as she begins to read the journal she has written, the reader is left with questions about the reliability of what she has written. Of the reliability of the memory of a woman that forgets each night what happened the previous day as well as the previous years. It makes for quite the suspenseful read as I was constantly questioning everything that was happening. And the end...just blew me away because even though I might have suspected something in the beginning, I had believed it to be impossible by the middle of the book. Which meant that the ending came to be a complete surprise for me which made the book even better in my opinion. This was a thriller that kept me on my toes and I cannot wait to read more by this author! Highly recommended.<br /><br />Bottom Line: One of the best thrillers that I have read in a long time. Simple as that :)<br /><br />Disclosure: I was lucky enough to be sent a copy of this book from the publisher.
B004SUWR2C|2.0|Well, it's Uno. But the graphics look like they were meant for a mediocre phone from 5 years ago. Won't even stretch to fit my phone's screen(Evo 3D). I wouldn't bother unless you are a die hard Uno fan and it's free.
1407109367|5.0|Book was in perfect shape when arrived.  A good trilogy!  The first book was the best of the series, but if you start reading them you must read them all!  Would recommend buying the whole set so you can let friends and family borrow them!
0240816250|4.0|I originally bought this book as I thought it would provide me with a better understanding of scanning and inkjet printing workflow. The book does NOT answer any of these questions. It is, however, an excellent book about traditional darkroom procedures. As long as you are aware of this, i can highly recommend this book.
B002KREVCO|5.0|Love this box set!  If you are into music DVD's, get the 1st Family Jewels to go along with the DVD here.  The CD's included are great too - rare studio and live tracks.  Also comes with a very cool booklet.  Pick this up!

B002HK9HR8|5.0|\\"Chinatown\\" has always been regarded as a true cinema classic.  Full of quotable dialogue, a skewered eye, great performances, excellent camera work, and a great score.  However it is a shame that such brilliance is being suppressed by the powers that be at Paramount because they have decided to pull the film out of circulation and thus begins the deluge of people selling copies of this film to the highest bidder.  Luckily I found mine for a reasonable price.  Apart from all of that this particular DVD version is an excellent transfer of a nearly forty year old film.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Love this sound track. Harry Potter music puts us in a happy mood! Later movies' sound tracks are very dark, but the first two are lighter. (I created my own play list on the computer for my favorite tracks.)
B005GYY0GA|5.0|Even in his older years, Johnny Winter still proves what a legend he is.  His voice sounds great and really fits the songs well. His guitar playing has so much style and taste. I feel like he really stuck to his \\"Roots\\" on this album (sorry I just had to do that.) T-Bone Shuffle, Further On Up The Road, Last Night, Maybellene, Bright Lights Big City, and Come Back Baby will be in my Johnny Winter playlist for a long time.  There are many other good songs too.  This album reminds me of great blues albums of the 50s and 60s that are all but gone these days. Thanks to Johnny Winter, the blues are still alive and well.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very soothing. works flawlessly. keeps the mind fresh.  great for killing time on a lunch break. price is very good for such a good looking app.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|I'm no Beyonce fan either, but I have to give BabyFace some credit for \\"Best Thing I Never Had.\\"  It's classic BabyFace piano written (the Deele style).  If you a BabyFace fan, this song is not a dissappointment, I mean it's work with Beyonce (it can't be perfect, but I think they did a good job with this one).    \\"What goes around, comes back around, my baby; what goes around, comes back around, and it Sucks to be you right now!\\"   A bit a attitude there 4 U..........  blackkerouac AKA Carstereo Ratliff

B002VPE1AW|1.0|Where to start with Avatar, well I could write several pages of crap about this movie but I will spare everyone the B.S. and will sum it up in one short sentence. \\"Dances With Wolves in Outer Space with some corporate greed ala Wall street via Aliens, go figure and a little Titanic thrown in for good measure!    P.S. The only decent thing about the movie was Stephen Lang's over acting!
B004R13U6Y|3.0|This is one of the nicer PDF readers and does most of what I need but the version here is several months older than the current version in the Android market. I have sent a message to the developers when this will be updated and there has been no response. I hope the amazon version has not been abandoned. If so there is no point in buying it from here. The Android market version is past 1.5 now and has several new useful features - yet no update here. Amazon support says there has been no update from the developers so it doesnt look good.
B0019M06JS|5.0|It's been a few years since I last bought an Eliane Elias album, simply because I'm still enamoured with her gorgeous interpretation of \\"Call Me\\" from her fantastic Dreamer cd.  Well, I've got to hand it to her; not only is she a great rival to Diana Krall in her special Brazilian way, but I will pick her any day over Mrs. Elvis Costello.  Though this album is two years old, I can never resist anything having to do with Brazilian music, especially bossa novas.  Some people are complaining because she has recorded songs like \\"Girl From Ipanema\\" and \\"Desafinado\\" on previous works.  I would be disappointed if she hadn't included them here given the title of the package, plus they are even more sophisticated and gorgeous than before.<br /><br />Here she has included new renditions of old pop standards such as \\"The More I See You,\\" \\"They Can't Take that Away from Me,\\" and \\"Too Marvelous for Words,\\" giving them all a fine makeover.  My personal favorite of these is undeniably \\"Day In, Day Out,\\" an upbeat number that will get you to tapping your toes and maybe even singing along.  She also has a very nice treatment of Stevie Wonder's \\"Superwoman\\" on this disc, and it's one I love to hear over and over.  Check out that Wonder-like harmonica work from Toots Thieleman!<br /><br />Other favorite tracks include \\"Falsa Saudade,\\" which is resemblant of \\"Doralise\\" from Dreamer, \\"Minha Soudade,\\" and \\"A Ra (The Frog)\\", all lively and verging on samba territory.<br /><br />Diversified without lacking cohesion, Eliane is in fine shape here, and I have always loved her prodigious piano style.  She has come a very long way from instrumental albums like So Far So Close (great stuff, by the way, if you're new to her), and her voice is gaining more confidence with each album.  Here she sounds right at home and, when it comes right down to it, you could say that she is.
B000TERK3C|4.0|I'm a bit surprised that many reviewers had rated The Bends as the best Radiohead album. I should say it's pure objective. The Bends is a mix of pop and classic rock, just a very good one. For those who love pop I guess it should be the best album, naturally, as R did not do that stuff much later one.<br /><br />As how it stands to the rest I would compare it to Beatles' Revolver. Revolver was definitely a revolution back in 1966 and the best album they did at that time. Many people would say it's the best Beatles album. However for many Beatles fans the later discs are quite more dear.<br /><br />Same for me, personally I grade any later R album well above The Bends, they just did a huge leap forward after that.
1594744769|5.0|I'll be honest, here - I decided to read this book because I like the author's name.  I also liked the name of the book.  I completely judged it by its cover.  Both are unique, and I hoped that the story would be equally so, though I really didn't want to get my hopes up.  BUT!  This is a truly unique story.  There are aspects that were a little creepy, even for someone so jaded as myself.  The creative process was amazing - the use of real old pictures throughout the story added something concrete to the already well-developed characters.  They were such a bonus, and I imagine that Riggs had a great time working on this book.  The prose is outstanding and natural; Riggs is powerful and emotional and insightful in his writing, without being flowery.  The man has a way with words :)  I don't even want to get into details about the story.  I knew nothing about the story when I started reading, and found that it made the experience better.  It's a little bit Big Fish and a little bit X-Files...and it's entirely worth it.  I can't wait to read the next one :)  The only downside is that this really isn't a good Kindle book - with all the cool old pictures in it, it'd be worthwhile to purchase a hard copy.
B002VL3R1K|5.0|The book was in great condition and got here quickly. i was very pleased with my order and plan on shopping with them again.
B0000019PA|5.0|I don't want to write a long review on why I think this is the best album of the 90s, but I've heard every classic album from the 90s... Seriously, I have from any band you can think of.  This is still my favorite album of the 90s.... The songwriting is unbelievable, it is some of the best songwriting in the history of music.

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Great fun, easy to use, and a good story. The dialog can be fairly corny or outright bad, and gameplay can be a bit repitive, but otherwise it is a fun game for someone who's looking to do more than complete puzzles in their phone game time.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I ordered this movie as a gift for my sister who is in love with RENT. so was so happy. it got to her on time and in great condition.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I loved every page of this book. I have read two previous books by Ellen, but I enjoyed this one the most. Every page is like Ellen speaking and just cracked me up. This is a woman who has done just about everything under the sun, and she is still quite humble and incredibly funny. With all I've read by her and as much as I've seen her on TV, I still learned quite a bit about this amazing woman and think that she is quite inspiring.<br /><br />Humor is one of the hardest things to bring off in print, but Ellen does it wonderfully and makes it seem so effortless. She can certainly write a terrifically funny book that is filled with inspiring messages (not the in-your-face kind, though, the inspiration just flows naturally) that I believe are helpful for women everywhere. Writing is just one of this funny woman's many talents. The inspiration in the book is simply an added bonus to the humor.<br /><br />Overall, terrific, entertaining read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a laugh and some inspiration as well. I think it's sure to bring a smile to your face as it did mine.
B002UNMW7O|1.0|I was disappointed by the sequel although hopeful that it would continue on with the same energy of last movie. I thought female replacement of FBI detective to be a cheesy representation of a female authority figure, trite with simplistic generalizations.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|What can be said, Lee does it again. I was a late comer to the Reacher series, only last yr. I started with \\"The Killing Floor\\" and read right on through the series like an addict. I am only dissappointed b/c now I have to wait for the next Reacher book to come. I loved the prequel setting and would not be upset to see another such book that follows one of Reachers military cases. Again I am only upset becuase now I must wait until the next installment of this great series hits the electronic presses...

B0036EH3WU|4.0|My husband ordered the LOST episodes from Amazon because we wanted to see the whole program again, all 7 seasons.  We were very satisfied with the way it was presented.  It came in a nice box marked \\"LOST\\" and has a game with pieces. and other memorabilia from the show,a booklet that talks about each of the characters and all the CD's needed to see the complete series with extra information included.  We got a good price from Amazon and with free shipping from Amazon, it was a great gift that we will enjoy for a long time to come.  I would recommend all LOST fans to consider it for purchase.
B0052REUW0|5.0|I bought the kindle version of the book  after reading reviews on the mainstream media. I did not intent to read the entire book (time), but to look for the graphs and the statistics regarding violence against women, as it seems to me, that such violence is very often under-reported. I was also hoping to be reassured that violence against women has also decreased.<br /><br />I was frustrated in my efforts to focus quickly on the subject of my interest and get to the appropriate graphs because the index is useless (just a list of  words), there is not even an effort to show any numbers or locations, no pages are given in this expensive kindle rendition, on the ipad  currently over $19, more expensive than the advertised hard cover, at least in the list I read when I bought the digital version!)<br /><br />Anyway, from just searching through the table of contents and looking under rights and women, there are various statistics for the US showing some decline in crimes against women, but as for the picture in the rest of the world, the author characterizes it as \\"murky\\". Accordingly, I would then label the conclusions of the book regarding violence against women as murky, and my hopes to see significant overall reduction were dashed! Of course,  it is not the fault of the author that there are no reliable statistics on issues of domestic violence in some other countries, but the hopefuleness of the title is clouded for me in this respect.<br />I also wonder how the ratio of women versus men fluctuated in relation to the level of violence. I do not know yet if this is covered in the book, because of the index and inking problem. One of the comments to my original review suggests that I can use a word search in the kindle version. I just tried typing \\"domestic violence\\". The search showed 55 results, a lot of them in the sections I read already. This seems to work for me, I will try other word searches.<br /><br />Kindle complaint to authors: It is not enough to be an illustrious author and meticulous researcher, you should check the quality of the digital rendering of the work for which you spent so much effort to research and create. Afterall, you are exposing you creation to the worls of instant digital readers (human and otherwise).<br /><br />October 5, 2011:<br />The above review was edited to clear misunderstandings. The original 2 star rating was in reference to the kindle format, as was the comment about poor production. In deference to those who thought that the rating reflected on the substance of the book, I changed the rating to 5 stars. Honestly, I could just delete the review, but I am really tired of buying kindle versions that are not rendered correctly. I buy a lot of technical and scientific books and this happens more than some of you realize. My complaints to Amazon about kindle quality control are usually ineffective. Complaining about it in a review of a book has produced results in the past (withdrawing a bad kindle version and issuing a corrected version).<br />Sorry to have upset so many of you, I have no vendetta against the author or this book. My original review, typed on the same ipad on which  I was reading the book, was open to misinterpretation, but I am glad that so many of you rose to defend what appeared as an unfair attack! That's one positive outcome of this exercise, at least for me!<br />Thank you.searcher, you should check the quality of the digital rendering of the work for which you spent so much effort to research and create.

B004MC8CA2|1.0|This app requires \\"View your accounts\\" permission, enabling it to get your email addresses and other personal information. WHY! I hit the \\"buy\\" button so I could see the permissions for myself - Amazon should let customers see the permissions apps request before \\"purchasing\\" them. Even as a free app, now this is stuck in my apps list forever and I will NEVER install it. (And they probably already forwarded my info on to the company as it is...)
B004EPZ07K|3.0|The comics fans were expecting something different (I don't know what, I don't read comics), I saw Ryan Reynolds and was expecting more comedy (like Seth Rogan in Green Hornet), but this film is really neither. Ryan did an excellent job of displaying his skills as an actor, and you did see a LITTLE of his more familiar style, but his role was more serious than I expected.   If you set aside your expectations and watch the film for itself, its pretty good. The effects look great, the acting is good, it has its humorous moments, and the storyline flows nicely into an open ending that begs for a sequel that will probably never be made (due to a lack of success of the first one). I myself will be sad if I do not get to see Ryan in this role again.  As others have said, it just doesn't stack up next to Marvel's line this summer, but I did not walk away feeling I had wasted my afternoon.

1423140591|4.0|I pre-ordered this book on my Kindle, so it would arrive at midnight and I could start reading it right away. I must say I have a certain obsession with Percy Jackson, so I was extremely pleased that he was one of the main characters in this book. Overall it was a good, action packed book, answering a lot of the questions that were unanswered in the The Lost Hero. I really like how well it tied in to all of the other Percy Jackson books. My only reason for not giving this book a five star review was the cliff hangar ending! I really don't want to have to wait a whole year before I can find out what happens when the Greek and Roman camps meet. Plus, I also really want to see Annabeth and Percy reunite! Oh well though. Its not like there is anything I can do to make them release the next book faster. All in all it was a great book and I really suggest that you read it.
0307269752|4.0|I would definitely say that this book is worth checking out for those who have the time. I didn't the book to be poorly translated at all but I felt that there were details that could have been left out. The ending could have used some work as well.

B0057GYOA4|3.0|The original release was a classic metal release. I do think that too many pinheads touted this as the ONLY sound of metal that mattered. blah , blah ,blah. in fact this was a disaster for metal as the genre became less and less melodic and well played until it's now almost a nonmusic entity with little listeners. However this release which may have led to metals downfall in some regards was still a classic cd release. In other words it should have been one of many styles of metal on the radio not the only kind and it's melvins influenced style among other groups was pretty good actually.  The disaster this sparked off wasn't the cd's fault it was the programmers who suddenly denounced all other forms of metal as bad and then proclaimed this group the messiah band, thereby insuring the death of kurt cobain who just wanted to make music.  This double release sounds pretty good and has extra stuff , but it does sound sonically different as well somewhat.  The real release is a five star cd , I still say though it's not a bit better than a five srar release of other types of metal.  like lets say the scorpions 'lovedrive'  a different genre of metal , but good stuff. there was room for all kinds of metal now all we get is stuff kurt cobain even would laugh at.  endless nickelback clones?  few singers that can sing, and worse playing,  which is ok when there's a variety of metal songs andtypes of metal on the metal radio station;over half have closed in the last five years by the way.  still this was a classic and should be seen as such. But not the end all of metal.  just one of it's branches that sadly overcame the rest and helped metal ;against the wishes of nirvana , spiral into the pits of todays one note boredom.

B0051T47NQ|4.0|It used to be that the only European films that could succeed in the US market were war films being able to pull in the ticket sales and the Academy Awards.  Examples include Battle of Algiers, Battleship Potemkin, Das Boot, and Lawrence of Arabia.  More recently, European filmmakers have been successful in other genres, such as romance (A Very Long Engagement), crime (Stieg Larsson's Millenium trilogy, Layer Cake), fantasy (Pan's Labyrinth) and comedy (Waking Ned Devine).  This success has been geographical in spread, starting with movies from the UK, France and Spain, and spreading West to the rest of Europe.  Finally, Scandinavian films are catching up.  Starting with the Swedish Millenium trilogy, followed by the cult horror classic, Let The Right One In, and last year's Finnish Rare Exports, 2011 saw the release of the Norwegian film Trollhunter.  Part comedy, part horror, and part fantasy, this film follows the mockumentary style of the Blair Witch Project, though it is less scary and less shaky.  This feature-length film follows a supposed trollhunter, an employee of Norway's government, who is assigned to track down and kill trolls that have left their refuge.  For those willing to put up with subtitles, this is a very impressive film.  The special effects are quite good, though this is helped by the fact that all the trolls are seen at night, which allows the filmmakers space in leaving out visual details such as skin texture, hair movement, etc...  The overall story-line is quite original, and the movie is quite enjoyable.
B001DPC4SM|5.0|If you own the original WB pressing or the currently available CD version, and compare either to this 180 gram vinyl, this will blow them away! This album never sounded so good. Even the inner tracks that always tend to sound crappier than the tracks on the outer edge of the LP sound good, clean and clear. ALL VINYL should play like this album! But when you listen to the original LPs, you understand why vinyl died. It is only making a comeback due to lower volume (no pun intended) pressing, possibly better quality vinyl, and better LP mastering techniques.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I have not watched the dvd version yet, but the blu-ray looks great.  I did see additional footage, which was nice.  The sound is great and my grandson and granddaughter was excited about the movie.  This movie keeps the attention of my nine month old grandaughter and almost two year old grandson.  The movie sometimes looked 3D to me.  I felt as though I could touch some of the images.<br /><br />The color was vibrant.  There are alot of extras for those interested, which I haven't seen yet.  I chose the blu-ray case for space issues.  Bestbuy is selling this for $19.99.  I also used a $5.00 off coupon that came in a kid's meal from Subway.  I ended up spending a total of $16.59 at Bestbuy, tax included.  A favorite in the past and still a favorite now.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />The dvd shows terrific as well. So far it has not been a freezing or skipping problem, as stated by a buyer.
B000002G7E|5.0|Yes, an amazing piece of work.  I can only add a surreal vignette: while travelling down to Devon for a holiday, we stopped in a farmhouse in deepest Somerset for an overnight.  While waiting for the evening meal we wandered over to the milking parlour to see what was going on.  I couldn't believe at least two of my senses: the milker was serenading his beasts to Sister Ray at a healthy volume.  Upon questioning he said that they responded really well to this tune and gave a good few drops more of the white stuff.  Nuff said, go out and buy if you want to increase your production.

B004WE01YA|5.0|I am reviewing the 3d part of this movie, everyone knows it is a good movie  the 3D is down right awsome, a totally new experiance for this movie.  takes it to a different level.  this is not a cheap conversion or so so 3D, this was done as well as if it was origninally done in 3D, cannot give this enough stars....
B00518HBD0|5.0|I've come to respect this band a lot.  They deliver some of the best melodic rock available nowadays, along with Incubus.  This is a very good album that represents its maturity and evolution since the \\"Kryptonite\\" days, following the \\"Here Without You\\" breakthrough.
B0007Y08QA|1.0|The only think shocking about this movie is how think Bales became.  He looked as if he just came out of a prisoner of war camp.  The whole thing didn't make sense.  Another wanna be mind bender that didn't work.  I could not figure out how his bosses didn't know he was sick and let him continue to work there doing dangerous work.  A complete waste of time.  The movie Repulsion with Catherin Deneuve was so much better in every way.

B0000DC14V|4.0|One of the great westerns and a marvelous vehicle for Brando to display his superb acting talents.  However, the print quality of this DVD is mediocre at best.  Can't say what sort of remastering it received - but it is decidedly sub-standard.  I recently ordered a copy of \\"The Caine Mutiny\\", made 6 or 8 years earlier than this film, and the picture quality is outstanding.  Why wasn't \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\" given the same treatment?
B0041KKYGA|5.0|[[ASIN:1150723092 The Great Cryptogram; Francis Bacon's Cipher in the So-Called Shakespeare Plays]]The Producer and the Director of this film evidently did not research the Lord Francis Bacon connection with Shakespeare.....If they had, they would have made a film of titanic proportions. First of all, the Earl of Oxford was one of seven members of Bacon's, \\"Helmet Bearer's Club,\\" whose patron saint was the \\"Goddess Phallus Athena.\\" Because the statue of her holds a \\"spear\\" she was also called, \\"The Shaker of the Spear of Knowledge at the Serpent of Ignorance.\\" This is the reason why Bacon, who was the leader of this group of literary giants, choose the man Shakepere as his \\"front man,\\" (he spelled his name without the last \\"a\\" in his name.) Bacon made him add the other \\"a\\" in case he was hauled up in front of a judge for writing these treasonable plays. Since Bacon was also the head of the Masonic Order, as well as the secret son of Queen Elizabeth the First, he wanted to educate the non-reading public of the tyranny of kings through the production of the plays......A clue to Bacon's part authorship of the plays lies in the King James Bible which Bacon edited. One has only to look up the 46th psalm of David and count the 46th word down which is \\"Shake,\\" and the 46th word up, which is, \\"Spear,\\" to see this clue.....There are countless others, such as, \\"The North Cumberland Manuscript,\\" listing many of the plays with Bacon's signature..... One of the best books about Bacon's authorship of the plays is the book by Ignatius Donnally, \\"The Great Cryptogram.\\"
B00536OCZA|2.0|The packaging is great, all I had hoped.  Unfortunately the manufacturing of the vinyl, or part of the packaging (looks like it was dragged across something) process, was done poorly.  The album came scuffed on both sides, one side substantially.  Pops and clicks are present throughout.  I gave it a thorough cleaning with a Nitty Gritty 1.5 cleaning unit which helped a little but the pops and clicks are still everywhere.  Easily the worst sounding new LP I have purchased, very dissapointing.
0312430000|5.0|Checklist Manifesto, which reads as pleasantly as a conversation with a good friend over coffee, makes a compelling case for concise process confirmation to ensure that critical routine steps are not missed in workflows that require significant expertise and creativity in potentially chaotic settings. As an added benefit, along the way, Gawande and his colleagues discover that for multi-discipline teams, working through well-conceived checklists together can improve overall team interaction and boost the contribution of members who are often marginalized.     I grew up with a father who instilled the value of the checklist in me at an early age. I remember building Heathkit projects with my dad and going through the parts checklists, the assembly checklists and double-checking assembly after completion. Our family used them in other areas, too. I carried this forward and today use checklists for complicated processes in my work ... or for packing for trips with our large family. I even have automated checklist processes and tracking at various times over the years.     I wouldn't normally pick up a book to convince me to do to what i already practice. However, when I saw that a Twitter a-lister was distributing it to his whole company, I thought I'd give it a read. I picked it up as a casual read. It ended up being a stimulating \\"conversation\\" - on the history of checklist processes in various industries (Aviation is amazing), the social stigmas of checklists among the brilliant and examples of where checklists literally save lives. Good read as story and as business process cogitation
0962477060|3.0|I love this book. I use it as a dictionary when I am using other books. For me is more like a practice reference book where I can find any scale on any position. I wish there was some music notation, but that is exactly the point of this book, to go straight to the point and minimize the theory, although the theory is explained really well. I would give it a 3.5 but I'll go with 3 for being a reference book. Buy it, you will use it for years.
1439170916|4.0|The \\"Emperor of All Maladies\\" is a history of cancer, both in general and treatment and research. The history encompasses everything from the early observations of cancer over two thousand years ago to the current trends. This history includes everything from the primitive treatments and surgeries of previous centuries, to the modern day pharmaceutical advancements that have been successful.   This book does an excellent job of explaining how the term cancer encompasses many different diseases--some cancers have better survival rates than others, and some cancers are better understood than others. This book also does a good job of explaining why cancer can be so difficult to deal with; it can be very difficult to discern between normal cells and cancer-cells.  Overall, this book is well-written and the author clearly understands the subject matter. My one criticism is in how the book is organized. The book as it  is organized is almost  a hybrid of chronology and topic. The book, in other words, jumps around a lot and it can be hard to follow along in places. The book would have been better if had more specifically organized as either according to chronology, or according to topic.
1401230067|5.0|This new version of the Original Sins TPB includes the first 9 issue of Hellblazer from 1988 along with issues #76-77 of the Swamp Thing. The first nine issues of Hellblazer involve a man named John Constantine who plays a role between heaven and hell and keeps the people safe from their literal demons all while being shunned from those of a higher, heavenly authority. The first issues involve Constantine helping an old friend who ended up releasing a demon named Mnemoth who makes people develop a voracious appetite for that which they covet and they eventually starve from it. Constantine is forced to use his contacts and find the evil beast plaguing the people and coax it right into a trap! Later, after thwarting a bit of demon politics, he meets a woman named Zed who becomes quite the love interest all the while helping him find a lost girl in a sickening kidnapping and then, after heading to the states to check on his old buddy Swamp Thing, encounters a man from `Nam that is still haunted by the mental wounds of war that envelope him. Constantine, hot on the trail of a religious sect, learn that he's not the only one who wants Zed and figures out that the cult has taken her and is using her as a \\"virgin Mary\\" of sorts and it's up to him to get her out of her predicament!<br /><br />In the issues of Swamp Thing, the Swamp Thing possesses Constantine's body to bear a child with Swamp Thing's wife but she is (rightfully) uncomfortable with the whole ordeal and doesn't truly believe it's Alec in Constantine's body and not just Constantine himself playing a devious trick. As she flees to think things through, she encounters the real Constantine back in his own body and learns that he's really out to protect her and bring her back to her love.<br /><br />These 9 issues of Hellblazer and two issues of Swamp Thing really do a fantastic job of story telling. There are points when you can really tell it's the late 80s (lots of talk about AIDS and politics) but the dialogue really draws you into the story and the art keeps you hooked. This isn't an actiony beat-em-up like other comics but a dark, gritty world of magic and evil where one man walking the spiritual line is the only hope for a chance at normality. This was a truly great read and one I highly recommend to anyone wanting a fantastic comic to flip through. This new edition with the extra issues (not to mention, cover gallery) is a definite plus as well!to the story and the art keeps you hooked.

B003EYVXVY|5.0|We went and saw Avatar twice at the theater. Visually, it is breathtaking. I couldn't look away, it's seductive beauty. I bought the Bluray when it was released and did indeed love it in 2D. I was afraid to watch it at first and be let down, but that was not the case!

030788743X|5.0|So there are books I love, and then there are books I *love*. Seriously.<br /><br />READY PLAYER ONE by Ernest Cline (Crown, August 16, 2011)<br /><br />I managed to pick this book up at ALA with zero clue what it was about and never having heard of it. I was actually standing in line waiting for an ARC of THE NIGHT CIRCUS. This one had a cool title and looked a bit like the 80s. But it wasn't until I saw it in the Audible recommendations that I decided to read it. What pushed me over the edge was the fact that it was narrated by Wil Wheaton :)<br /><br />So I started listening on audio, and I could not stop. This is the kind of audio book I found myself making excuses of places to drive so I could listen to it. I listened when my kids were in the car (which I never do). I looked forward to folding laundry because I could listen while I folded. And even though the book ended nicely with all ends tied, I still wanted more because I enjoyed it so much.<br /><br />Set in a future where the energy crisis has hit big time, lots of people are calling this the next 'SNOW CRASH,' and sure, I do see 'SNOW CRASH'-ish elements in the story, but overall it's a story about the virtual world the characters live in, and not so much about the real world (though world development is done well...don't get me wrong).<br /><br />The author (who happens to live in Austin) does an amazing job of creating tension, worrying the reader, and then assuaging the situation. I love this. I want to reach a point of worry and frustration, but I don't want to stay there too long. And READY PLAYER ONE delivers.<br /><br />Who would I recommend this book to? Everyone :)<br />Okay, seriously, if you<br /><br />  1. love the 80s<br />  2. love video games<br />  3. love MMO games (like World of Warcraft or Wizard 101 is that is more your speed)<br />  4. love science fiction and enjoy books like SNOW CRASH<br />  5. want to see what Wil Wheaton is up to these days (listen to audio in this case)<br /><br />Wait, does that cover everyone? My recommendation: AN ABSOLUTE MUST!<br /><br />Source of Book: ARC from publisher at ALA, Audio purchased from Audible.comublisher at ALA, Audio purchased from Audible.com
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|This was my son's favorite movie when Lion King was orginally released. This 4 pack is great. The aminated out-takes are great. Although he is 18 we are sure to enjoy this movie again as a family.
0393338827|4.0|The uncontrolled forces that are founded on temerity, opportunistic/exploitative assessments, worship of unlimited greed, and the energy of gambling.....It is also a reminder of how mentally lazy and avoidant we can be...a reflection of the illusion in our society about living in debt as business as usual...The author is smart for choosing to tell this story which could be technical and dry, by centering it around the main players and bringing their personalities and idiosyncrasies. Not an easy book for me, but certainly educational/fairly entertaining one.
B001F12J48|1.0|The movie itself is a wonderful movie.  DO NOT purchase the 3D Version.  I bought the 3D version for my children thinking this would be terrific family fun.  I have never seen such poor quality in 3D production.  Even with the glasses on everything still looks like it has 3 images and everything looks red and blue.  It is horrible.  Great movie but do not get the 3D version you will be disappointed.
B0030Y11XS|3.0|Regardless of your political alignment with Michael Moore, he is a solid filmmaker and 'Capitalism' is a very entertaining movie.  In fact, on a level of sheer entertainment, I'd say it's definitely a contender for his best.  He's got his guerrilla invasions of corporate headquarters and institutions down to a science, and he's certainly adept at pressing emotional button.  Moore's main problem is in his journalism.  Many of his main points reek of spin and he is not objective at all.  I know that he's not technically a journalist, but I think that his films target very serious topics that require pristine fact checking.  For those that are more to the left with Moore, they will obviously not be too distracted with this, but that are not in the same political sphere will have no problem punching MAck truck sized holes in his presentation.
B005ELZKWS|3.0|Well, this one is better than the first, but not what I would expect from a \\"Supergroup\\".  While I didn't expect a metal album from them, I did expect more fast songs that rocked harder. Unfortunately, almost all the songs are blues based with simple progressions and riffs. There are times that Satriani gets to go off, but they are few and far between. Sammy needs to lay off the tequila if he truly feels this is his best work! All this band will ever be is a \\"Party\\" band for casual listening. Here are what I feel are the problems with their compositions:  1.) Satriani has resigned his playing to blues idioms, which are tired and uninspiring.  2.) Satriani is not used to being in a real band, and clearly needs more experience in writing in a band situation.  3.) It sounds like it was all recorded in one day. Take the time to build interesting progressions!  Those are the glaring issues that I see. I think this band is probably much better live than on record, and this album isn't terrible, but come on guys - you can do better!
0385504225|4.0|lovely book. thoroughly enjoyed it form front to back. will read it again. a modern classic that will keep you on your toes.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|One of the best weather apps out there. I would like to see the round clock widget look like the one in the app. Great work.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|The Dream Theater up till this point is one of my favorite bands ever, even with their output from this one on, I'd still keep them in there, unlike Queensryche, who make Metallica look like a good band.  Images and Words, Awake, Scenes, Falling, and the live version of When Dream And Day are all awesome albums, and Six Degrees is no slouch either.  This album, however, started a long string of subpar releases for the band.  Sure overall they're passible, but I want more than a passible album, where I have complaints about every song, which is otherwise a good song, but maared by some annoying playing by Rhudes, or pointlessly long instrumental breaks.  As for this album, I personally don't understand why people consider this an all out heavy album, many consider it their heaviest album.  Frankly most of the songs have soft verses, the ones that have lyrics anyways.  One song doesn't even have guitars at all.  The heavier guitar sound is definitely heavier than any Dream Theater album before it, possible exception of Six Degrees, but I think this tops that.    Musically, well..  We all know these guys are talented and there are some killer pieces here, but most of the songs drag on way too long.  None of these songs should have been approaching 15 minutes.  Well 1 does on here.  I'll admit I'm not a huge long song fan.  Once it passes 10.30 I start to lose interest, but when a song is suppose to be that long, and flows like it, and works, then I don't hold that against it.  I can think of several songs that to me should be longer.  On here the songs are made longer by pointless jam sessions.  James's vocals are very solid on this one.  Love his vocals in Endless Sacrifice the best.  His melodies are also very solid.  Otherwise the production is fairly solid.    As I Am 8/10 starts with a keyboard note ringing before a slow paced intro of guitars drums and bass, before erupting into a groovy heavy metal opener, kind of Metallica-esque, but better because these guys don't suck like Metallica does now.  There's a slow pre-chorus.  The chorus itself is fine, but I wish the pacing was as fast as the verses.  It just feels a little deflating, but still it's a nice opener, and probably my favorite song on the album, without editing anyways.  Endless Sacrifice 9/10 When edited is my favorite song on here.  The song clocks in at over 11 minutes, which I edited it down to just under 10.  The first half of the instrumental break is the same riff being played over and over to some annoying keys by Rhudes, if memory serves me, I edited it a long time ago, and don't listen to that part anymore.  Also there's a break with some stupid piano and keyboard playing, again by Mr. Rhudes.  Seriously this album should've been the last straw with him.  He never did anything useful from this album on, Dramatic turn of events being the newest album at the time.  As for the actual song, the verses are acoustic guitars with James's vocals over them, with a nice build towards a heavy chorus.  James is at the top of his game here.  They wanted to go in a heavier direction, and have his voice shift more towards that, and here, despite it not being a heavy song, it works on the heavier parts.  Love the passion in both his voice and the music, during the chorus.  I'd give this song s perfect score if the album version were as my edited version.  Nice solo during the second half of the instrumental break.  Dying Soul 7/10 is the next piece in Portny's 12 step program trilogy.  It starts with a promising heavy and fast intro, before slowing down, into the chorus riff.  Oh, how I'd have loved the first main riff to have been the verse riff.  Uh, oh well.  This is another that drags on, and on.  The verses are softer, with clean guitars, and the opening vocals they'd copy on Systematic chaos.  Then they go into this weird distorted vocal part, before the song gets heavier.  The chorus is solid, nice riffs, good drumming.  Then we get a heavy fast riff again, withannoying distorted vocals, before it slows and James sings again.  I'm not a fan of distorted vocals.  Then it kind of meanders off for a while with the distorted vocal parts.  I'm not as impressed with the second verse, fine with it being heavier, but like I said, I don't like the distorted vocals, and it just kind of felt like they didn't know what they wanted to do with that verse.  They jam out a bit, before going into some more of a bridge, then we get references to Glass Prison.  Uh, this is the part of this trilogy I HATE.  They bring in pieces of previous songs in every one.  The bridge lasts for a while, and really doesn't go anywhere after a while.  It just gets old.  I end up cutting the song off at the 9 minute mark usually.  I'd give this song a higher rating if it weren't such a jumbled mess.  Honor Thy Father 7/10 is another over 10 minute song.  They really could've added some 4-7 minute songs in there to break things up a bit, but they didn't.  This song starts out with some nice heavy riffs, before a softer verse, uh again.  Still the song is played pretty well.  There's a heavier build towards the chorus.  More distorted vocals, but they work ok here.  The chorus is ok, the melody makes it work for me.  The second verse is heavier, and I wish they'd gone with this for the first as well.  But, whatever.  There's a different build towards the second chorus, which works.  Nothing wrong with changing things up a bit.  Then the instrumental break kicks in, with half the song to go.  We get a riff played over and over, with vocal samples, I'm guessing from movies or something.  Vocal samples being another pet peeve ov mine in music.  This goes on for a minute and a half, before we get some sort of keyboard solo, uh.  Not impressed.  The riffs seem to fit the chorus, \\"On and on and on and on they go..\\"  The break is overly long and overly repetative for how long it is.  If this were a 30 second break or even a minute, it'd be acceptable, but not for 3 1/2 minutes.  We get about 20 seconds of a cool guitar solo before the chorus comes back in.  This song could've worked as an 8 minute song, giving the song an actual solo instead of the jumbled garbage of an instrumental break.  Again, this song would be much higher rated otherwise, but no.  They went for a garbage break instead of a good one.  They're better than that.  In The Name Of God 7/10 starts with a clean guitar part, before some heavier riffage.  The first verse is a drum and bass thing with James's vocals and some heavier guitars mixed in here and there for effect, then a break and the guitars kick in for an actual main riff.  Then we get a weird piano piece which takes all the momentum away, before a decent chorus.  One thing, good or bad, not sure which, I'll say about this album is there are a lot of changes.  The second verse is completely different from the first, leading into the chorus, without that annoying piano part this time, works so much better.  Then we get an alright bridge, leading into another chorus.  Honestly they should have just thrown in a guitar solo after this bridge, had the chorus, and then ended the song.  Heck it sounds like it's over, briefly, before going into a cool sounding bass moment with some drums and keys over it.  Here we get another, eh I don't want to call it a bridge at this point, but we get more vocals, as the song gets heavier again.  We get another point where they could have ended the song, before a brief annoying keyboard mess, thankfully only a couple seconds worth.  Then for most of the remaining 7 minutes it's jam session time.  The soloing in the first part doesn't even work for me.  It's very repetitive, and doesn't fit the song.  This is another, otherwise 8 or 9 song, as the previous 2, which had to be brought down by  a pointless jam session.    Not a fan of instrumentals, and Vacant really didn't do anything for me.  Overall this is a solid album, but it really needed to be edited down a bit.  Sure these were going to be long songs either way.  But seriously.  And if the instrumentals were better, they might have worked at their lengths, but for me it didn't work.  To me this is one of the more disappointing albums, with Black Clouds, because both of those albums, the songs were there, but they were marred by something.  This one jam sessions, Black Clouds bad lyrics.  Still this is an album every Dream Theater fan should own.  Most probably like the extended instrumentals, so they'll be fine with them.  If you're new to the band, get Images And Words, Scenes From A Memory, or Awake, their 3 best albums.  Then if you like those, you can make your way through the rest of their discography.

B003Y5HWGI|4.0|The seventh season of Desperate Housewives is very similar to the quality of season six, if not slightly better. The story lines are quite a bit better but the writers of this once 'cultural phenomenon' definitely seem to be slipping. While watching this season, it's hard to imagine that it is even the same show as the episodes that aired in its first few seasons. That being said, Desperate Housewives is still a well loved show and still manages to capture the attention of millions. The seventh season is definitely a worthy addition to anybodies collection as we see Susan, Lynette, Bree and Gaby dealing with a bundle of interesting story lines as desperately as they possibly can. No matter how much worse it gets, this is still a great show and the seventh season definitely works as a great lead-in to the eight and final season.

B002ZG981E|2.0|This movie is like a boring version of the old DreamScape movie from back in the 80's. A lot of empty attempt at minimalistic style and pretentious concepts that are totally unfounded even for a sci-fi film. Most of this film makes no sense, the layers or dreams, subconscious etc, it's all overly done to the point of making the film a laughable joke. These stealthy mind jackers can completely subdue the host? the host can't break out in some infinitely variable phantasmagoric random dream sequence? nope, nothing... for a movie based on dreams this has to be the most empty, boring piece of hype i've ever watched. With all the modern film technologies to draw from and this is all this loser director can muster for a dream based movie? boring empty imagery, stupid sound track with retarded wonky \\"kick\\" soundtrack lol, it's a joke. Jean Cocteau did some of these stunts decades ago and with superior effect. I'd say go back to Batman, you can't cut it in the big time to the director.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|These are perfect for connecting a camera to your iPad or inserting a smaller flash card into one of the connectors to load photos directly. I took a Nikon D-80 and a QuickShot camera to Norway. Using one of the two the Connection Kit devices I was able to connect my Nikon via USB directly to my iPad. Using the other Connection Kit device I removed my flash card from my QuickShot camera, inserted it into the kit device, and connected the kit device to my iPad. In both cases I easily and quickly loaded my photos directly into my iPad. From there you have the flexibility to upload to the Internet too if you so desire. A great purchase.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I pre-ordered this book as all of the hype had me intrigued.  For me the book lacked in color and depth. With such an imaginative premise the book did not come to life, the characters were flat and the plot moved slowly. It's an easy read and not unpleasant...just dull.
0553275976|5.0|Conspicuous consumption, shoulder padded-blazers, a roaring bond market, and other hallmarks of 80's culture seem dated enough today to be comical, and The Bonfire of the Vanities is very much a novel of its time. So what's to recommend this portly tome to readers 25 years later? Some of the same traits that mark all great fiction, yet which are particular strengths of Wolfe's: a keen ear for dialect, an almost discomfitingly keen understanding of human nature, and finally, descriptive bon mots that cast the world anew while also giving a \\"Yes! That's _exactly_ how it is!\\" satisfaction.<br /><br />While the cultural trappings of mid-80's New York no longer apply, everything that makes this book move still feels bracingly current: the thrill and lust for power, journalism's drive for The Story, political machinations, the grimy real-world operations of the law, Society etiquette, racial tensions, and those errors in judgement upon which fates turn. The book is a colorful, vivid illustration of how the issues may change, but people stay the same.<br /><br />For the writer, there is much to relish in Wolfe's rich vocabulary and continually inventive turns of phrase. I found myself thinking of the old writers' adage \\"Show, don't tell,\\" and then thinking \\"But if you can do it this well, tell away!\\" The witticisms are too many to quote, yet too delicious to omit entirely. Speaking of an office building, Wolfe writes \\". . . a glass tower that rose up sixty stories from out of the gloomy groin of Wall Street.\\" Discussing a hung-over character who's attempting not to remember last night's follies, he says \\"Whatever he had done was submerged like a monster at the bottom of a cold dark lake.\\" In a trendy restaurant we hear the \\"aerobic voices of the young and swell,\\" and at a socialite party we envision \\"Two men and an impeccably emaciated woman.\\" There's a lot more where that came from, but I'll let you discover them for yourself.
B005OYKIJ0|3.0|A great set-piece and stunt near the beginning of the movie and a marvelously destructive chase scene at the end but nothing much between the two events.  Fans of the franchise will no doubt be well pleased.  Fans of knuckle-headed action movie can probably find better stuff to waste their time on.  'A-Team' for example was a much better knuckle-headed waste of time.

Of course, it isn't heavy reading and you can figure out where it's going to end up, but the ride was really fun and I enjoyed all the twists and quirks that were thrown in along the way.  I find Ms. Kinsella's writing very easy-going and her sense of humor is spot-on.  I thoroughly enjoyed this for what it is ... a light, entertaining read.  As to some of the disparaging reviews on here - lighten-up!  The twists and turns in the book are delightful, and there are people out in the real world that absolutely resemble Lexi and the other characters in the book.  Take a chance on it...it's FUN!

B004LWZW4C|3.0|Warning: Some spoilers ahead.<br /><br />X-Men: First Class has a lot going for it, namely having Bryan Singer back on board as a co-producer, and Matthew Vaughn (the guy who was supposed to direct X-Men: The Last Stand before Brett Ratner came on board and well, you know the rest) in the director's chair; all of which help make it the best X-Men film since X2: X-Men United.  All of that though can't help the film from being anything else other than average, but that in itself should be recognized as being something of an achievement.  Young mutants Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) find themselves recruited by the CIA as the nefarious Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) seeks to jump-start nuclear war in the 60s.  Along the way they encounter the vengeful Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) and assemble the first team of X-Men, well, more or less anyway.  Ignoring a number of things from X-Men Origins: Wolverine (which takes place in the timeline after this film does and features Xavier walking and Emma Frist as a teenager), First Class may be seen as a bit of a reboot I guess, and in that respect it kind of works.  What makes it as good as it is however are the performances of McAvoy and the spectacular Fassbender as the young Professor X and Magneto respectively.  January Jones is stiff and underwhelming as Emma Frost, while the young X-Men lineup is more miss than hit.  The liberties the script takes with the X-Men comic mythos is as groan-worthy as it was the past couple times around, but Vaughn manages to inject enough atmosphere to re-create the swingin' 60s that the film stands on its own and is a pretty worthwhile trip.
B00005MP58|5.0|Colin Firth IS Darcy as Timothy Dalton IS Rochester as Richard Armitage IS John Thornton.  I cannot praise this version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" enough.

B004HW7JMO|4.0|When news of a prequel series to Spartacus: Blood & Sand would be produced due to the illness of star Andy Whitfield (who sadly passed away), I feared that it would be a shoddy and quickly produced affair.  Thankfully, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena is far, far from that, and in some ways even outshines Blood & Sand.  Detailing the evolution and bloody rise of Batiatus (John Hannah) and Lucretia (Lucy Lawless), as well as delving into the origins and backstories of Oenomaus (Peter Mensah) and Crixus (Manu Bennett); Gods of the Arena delivers the goods in terms of stylized bloody action and drama.  Hannah and Lawless are spectacular and do great jobs further fleshing out their characters than they did in Blood & Sand, while newcomer Dustin Clare shines as prized gladiator Gannicus.  All in all, while Gods of the Arena suffers from some of the same shortcomings that Blood & Sand did, such as the sometimes ridiculously fake-looking CGI, it is a wonderful mini-series that does great justice to Spartacus as a whole, and is a more than worthwhile endeavor for fans of the first season of the show.
B000GH2YPG|5.0|I'll never understand the 1 star reviews. This is one of my all-time favorite books, and anything else Daphne du Maurier writes is always amazing as well. This book haunted me for days the first time I read it. Yes, her characters have flaws, yes, you get frustrated with them, yes, there are cruel twists - is this not life? Rebecca is suspense at its realest and I absolutely adored it.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|For all the aracnophobics and everyone else out there who enjoys an easy to learn but challenging to master game of stealing food from greedy spiders (who are also musicians, go figure!).  It seems like there are a ton of solutions to many puzzles to fit your play style, but a few special challenging levels there may be only one way to thwart the spider!  A 1 per 24 hr hint (more aptly a show me the solution though....) is available after a minimum frustration-time... a good compromise I think but maybe let it be more progressive so that the first hint shows you 1 move, then the next hint shows 2 moves, ed. So the solution is not spilled in entirety.

B0011NVC98|3.0|I give the movie Beowulf a 3 star rating.  I give the movie this rating because it did have many of the characteristics of the original story, but there were many major differences throughout it as well.  At the beginning, the movie was not unlike the original story.  There was a strong sense of Anglo-Saxon culture in the movie as shown with the scene in the mead hall.  Grendal was the monster in both the story and the movie. Grendal also did attack Herot, but left the king, Hrothgar, alive.  Beowulf, was also very similar to what the story lead us to believe of him.  He was very proud of himself and wanted to be known as a hero.  Beowulf also did fight Grendal in the movie and tore off Grendal's arm.  Although all was going well, the movie started to change dramatically.  Grendal's mom in the movie killed all of Beowulf's men instead of taking Hrothgars closest advisor.  Also a major difference was when Beowulf fought Grendal's mother.  Grendal's mom in the movie was Angelina Jolie to begin with.  In the movie there was no major battle between Grendal's mom and Beowulf.  Instead Beowulf had an \\"affair\\" with Grendal's mom and ended up never killing her.  Grendal's mom in the movie cut off Grendal's head instead of Beowulf cutting off his head.  Years after Beowulf \\"slayed\\" Grendal's mom, he became king of Herot and later had to fight a dragon.  Although in the movie, the dragon was in fact Beowulf's son.  The dragon did kill Beowulf in both the story and the movie.  The end of the movie was also very different than that of the original story.  Grendal's mom in the end of the movie tried to sway Wiglow into liking her like Beolwulf did.  Although with all of these changes put into play, I still enjoyed the movie very much.
076781214X|1.0|Amazon's product descriptive information for this movie DVD includes a \\"Review\\" stating \\"the DVD release has optional full-screen and widescreen presentations....(etc.).......\\".

B004SBQAN8|5.0|I wasn't expecting the greatest film of all time when I watched this but it turned out to be very entertaining for a sci-fi blockbuster. I like how the story unfolded and the acting was not poor. If anything this had much more substance than Twilight in terms of character development and plot so the influx of negative movie reviews are surprising to me.
030788743X|1.0|A retro escapist yarn whose schtick wears thin around page thirty.  Writing is stilted and obvious, the depth of reference - not to mention reverence - shallow, and once more, obvious. Almost painfully so. What renders the book so undergrad-quality is its amateurish loftiness, the broad strokes of characterization, the dejected tone of the narration. Allow me to pour one out for what could have been a Johnny Mnemonic-type cyber-scavenger hunt, rather than the rose-tinted, nostalgia-stroking adolescent grumbling it ultimately is.

B005HS00V4|3.0|I haven't seen or heard this DVD yet, but I did see Peter's show this past summer with the New Blood Orchestra, and I can tell you first hand - amazing! I was floored! This wasn't your average sappy sweet slow string accompaniment - this orchestra WAS the show.<br /><br />  This is orchestration on steroids! Think Beethoven mixed with Copeland mixed with Shostakovich, and then turn the volume up to 12. They are totally engaged with every aspect of the music, and the arrangements are absolutely first rate (can't recall the arranger's name).<br /><br />  Peter's performance is relegated to more of a vocal accompaniment, as opposed to the center of attention, and he seems to relish his new found role while standing aside and letting this bombastic and talented orchestra give new life to his old standards.<br /><br />  If you are one of those people who've always thought an orchestra could never whip up the power and fury of a live rock band, you need to see this. Prepare to pick your jaw up from the floor. Oh, and as if that weren't enough, the visuals are stunning also.<br /><br />  I distinctly remember saying to my wife and friends as we were leaving the show that night \\"Man, I really hope he puts this concert to DVD\\". Well thank you Peter for making that wish come true. I'm putting this pre-order in right now for the DVD. I will review and report back later.<br /><br />FOLLOW UP**********<br /><br />  Well, I did finally obtain my copy of this DVD. Being a long time, die hard fan of Peter, it pains me to say it, but I have to pull at least one star from my initial rating. First of all, this is not quite the same set list I saw him perform live here in Philly. Most of his originals were the same, but sadly missing is \\"Father and Son\\" - a beautiful tribute song he wrote to his father, along with a few other good ones that were on his set list the night I saw them. The cover songs are almost all different, and I must contend that the cover set that I saw them perform was much more interesting.<br /><br />  Also, and I'm not sure if this show was done early on in the tour (I would assume it was, being in London) but the performance just doesn't seem to flow like the show I saw. Peter's voice is strong and clear, but he seems a bit \\"disconnected\\" with the orchestra. And the orchestra itself seems weak and unrehearsed. At some points this almost 100 piece orchestra seems to sound more like an apprehensive, nervous string quartet! And to make matters worse, I feel they were mixed way to far in the background. The live performance I saw the orchestra was EXCITING and engaged - they were on their feet and their sound was powerful and in your face. The entire venue was shaking.<br /><br />  So all in all, I'm not sure if it's a performance issue, a sound mixing issue, the choice of songs, or all of the above, but compared to the live show I saw, I can not wholeheartedly recommend this disc. It's probably a nice addition to have for die hard Peter fans just to see and hear how his music transposes into a more classical/orchestrated genre. But don't expect the chills down your spine like the ones experienced at the live performance.if this show was done early on in the tour (I would assume it was, being in London) but the performance just doesn't seem to flow like the show I saw.

B004P8JPS6|2.0|I love, love all the Reacher novels - have read them all - although not in order. However with each novel - you discover just a bit more about Reacher's character and enjoy each adventure Lee Child takes you on. However, the latest offering is very - ahhh - I am on a contract so will try and think of something new.  There was too much verbose language around Reacher walking around the town and more sex scenes - which normally add a nice spice to the novels - but here they became kind of boring. Also the general \\"bad guy\\" story just didn't really exist here - even right at the end.  Usually after finishing a Reacher novel - often in one or two sittings I am left wanting more immediately - but the Affair left me a little cold. I will read the next one - but perhaps with not quite so much anticipation!

B002SSUQFG|4.0|Of course Seiko is well-known world wide for its innovations in watches, (e.g., the Spring drive) but it excels in making automatic watches available for those that don't want precious metals and precious prices with movements that require servicing at regular intervals.  Instead they make a line of watches that, if need be, can simply have the movements replaced.  Or the watch can simply be replaced.  As it turns out, Seiko has done this so well, that this watch, which I purchased on Amazon for less than $70 US, is surprisingly accurate, as automatics go, after a month of wear, and is nicely styled at the same time.  The materials used to make the watch are good quality and quite well finished.  And even though it only  runs at six beats/second, it has a sweeping second hand that still looks smooth.  Naturally, it will stop running if it's not worn daily, as would any automatic watch.<br /><br />There are some things to mention - it's a small watch - with 18 mm lugs and less than 40mm case, it's smaller than what is considered fashionable by today's trends.  Seiko has bigger watches.  This just isn't one of them.  And then there's that goofy crown at four o'clock that's pretty darn hard to operate.  I'm happy to see Seiko moving away from this trend.  But, when it's seated, it won't rub uncomfortably.  And the band is passable, but a word of caution on that - the finish on the watch is a matte silver (kind of like titanium, but not exactly), so getting it to match a different band will be bit of a challenge.  And the area between the lugs is shiny.  Seiko makes another \\"model\\" that includes a matching metal band, but it's harder to find.<br /><br />Overall, like many other Seiko 5 watches, this is a well-made watch that is a solid performer and won't break the bank.

B0058WFO06|5.0|In Steven Wilson's second full solo offering, we are treated to the work of a man who may well be at the height of his musical powers.  Grace for Drowning is a massive work of astonishing inspiration and musicality; it clocks in at somewhere over 80 minutes, and sprawls over two 40-minute-give-or-take CDs of similar structure but rather different moods.  Anyone who expects to get the hang of it and be singing along after a couple of listens had best look elsewhere.    The several layers of Wilson genius are on full display here: His uncanny ability to assimilate and reformulate diverse influences and present them as something fresh, his apparently limitless melodic instinct, and an unerring sense of song sequence.  The familiar tricks and tropes are recognizable, but offered up with a level of accomplishment and assurance that elevates Grace for Drowning above even the brilliant Insurgentes, his first solo album.  While the main influence is the jazz-fusion prog-rock of Lizard-era King Crimson, and his guest musicians are a thoroughbred mix of jazz and rock artists who play as if this album were their very own, the work is without question Steven Wilson's: melody is never forgotten, the dark themes predominate, and even during the most free-form of the improve-like sequences there is a sense of tight control over the entire enterprise.    There are rare lapses of judgment on this album, the conventional and Blackfieldesque \\"Postcard\\" being one of them.  The highlights of the album include the achingly beautiful \\"Deform to form a Star\\" and the terrifying \\"Index\\".  And towering above it all is the massive, 23-minute \\"Raider II\\", a monster of a piece, the dark and brutal soul of the entire album.  If there is anyone left who is unsure of Wilson's unsurpassed command of the \\"prog epic\\", this piece alone will remove all doubt.    Grace for Drowning is a remarkable achievement, a huge, complex, and sophisticated album that demands and rewards careful and repeated listens.Long anticipated by fans, it does not disappoint, in fact it surpasses expectations.  If you need to be challenged by your music, don't pass it up.   Four and a half stars, rounded to five.

0857685570|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1HQUQ0W3F2G6C]](This review is updated to reflect some comments made by the publisher in the comments section.)<br /><br />This is the updated edition of the 2004 edition [[ASIN:0973278676 Drew Struzan: Oeuvre]]. The publisher Titan Books considers it a brand new edition, with lots of additional and up-to-date material, plus text by Dylan Struzan - Drew's wife. It is described as 'a sumptuous companion volume to The Art of Drew Struzan'.<br /><br />So what's the difference between this book vs [[ASIN:1848566190 The Art of Drew Struzan]] and [[ASIN:0762420839 The Movie Posters of Drew Struzan]]?<br /><br />The Movie Posters of Drew Struzan is a 120-page hardcover selection of movie posters up to 2004. The Art of Drew Struzan is the 160-page hardcover selection of works featuring lots of accompanying sketches together with his finished drawings, complete with commentary on his thoughts and stories behind each piece. Oeuvre is collection of works representing his career, up to 2010.<br /><br />Much of what you see here is duplicated in The Movie Posters of Drew Struzan so there's no point getting that book, especially when the price different is small. Even though there is duplication in The Art of Drew Struzan as well, that book is still worth getting because of his sketches and if you want to read about his creative process.<br /><br />Alright, back to Oeuvre.<br /><br />Drew Struzan's art is beautiful, possibly unparalleled. You already know that.<br /><br />The amount of work he created is immense and this book is a tribute to his mastery. It's a 314-page large format hardcover with illustrations all printed at full page on good paper. You're getting close to 300 illustrations. This is an amazing value for money.<br /><br />His familiar works for movie posters are all inside, arranged into the type of work namely, music, movies, commercial and personal. The bulk of work appears in the movie section, of course. You'll get the see familiar works he did for Star Wars, Back to the Future, Indiana Jones, and many of the lesser known ones. His portfolio is awe-inspiring.<br /><br />For this 2011 reprint edition, Some of the new works included, those after 2004, are Cowboys and Aliens, Pan's Labyrinth, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls, Hellboy II, The Walking Dead. Some of this have appeared in The Art of Drew Struzan but included here to make this collection complete. So if you actually have the The Art of Drew Struzan and the 2004 Oeuvre, there's no need to get this edition because you already have all the art.<br /><br />The personal pieces included are some figure drawings and paintings that are done in a non-Drew Struzan style, compared to his movie art, or course.<br /><br />The captions for the illustrations appear at the back of the book, arranged by page order, describing the medium and what the art was for. I wish there was another index listing his work alphabetically because sometimes it hard to find a particular title from those 300 plus pages. The alphabetically arranged copyright index at the end could do with those page numbers.<br /><br />Oeuvre is the definite collection of Drew Struzan. If you have to get just one, this is it.<br /><br />Most highly recommended. One of the best art books for 2011.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog.

1594744769|1.0|The best thing about this book was the photos. The plot was overblown and unclever, and the author's language got in the way of the story. He needs to write like a disaffected teen would speak. The plot needs to be clever and interesting. I didn't find the main character at all pleasant to be around, which is sort of the first task of a writer. You have to get the reader to like the main character. All in all, I finished this book as quickly as I could just to get it behind me. Very disappointing.
B00000IBBG|3.0|Robert is cleansing his musical palate with this release. It does not sound like anything else he ever released. I listen to it like a Brian Eno ambiance album. Metal Machine Music anyone? Free form jazz and rock rhythms. I hoped for drum wizardry and whimsical vocals and lyrics. That isn't what I got. Like I said, ambient music from my musical hero.

B0052TDGQO|4.0|\\"Clear as Day\\" is an excellent first album.  The songs are true to the Scotty we saw on American Idol; sincere, compassionate, genuine.  The songs do not make good use of that amazing low-note dip he made such good use of on AI, but they do use his range and are well-suited to his genuinely country voice and style.  The arrangements on the songs sound a bit like the producer was leaning toward a \\"country-pop\\" sound which is not the best choice for Scotty's amazing voice and talent, which is why the four stars instead of five.  That said, I consider this a \\"must have\\" for any true lover of country music.  As his producers and he come together on the approach and style suited to him, watch to see Scotty become a true superstar.  I fully expect to see him, at some point, inducted into the Grand Ole Opry.

B002436WFI|5.0|This adaption seemed to clear up some of the early unfocussed writing of Practchett first two disc world novels. More of a narrative and less gag driven, the changes and trimmings were not distracting to me. I personally loved Astin as Twoflower though it seems you either love of hate him. Jason David was brilliant as well if maybe a little old. The luggage was perfect, lumbering like a petulant skunk. Brilliant fun, and Pratchetts cameo made all the difference at the end with perhaps the best line of the movie (that kind of sums up the whole disc world philosophy) how it's all (ie, life) a matter of perspective.
B0058WFO06|5.0|This may be Wilson's greatest musical output to date. Very dark and progressive is the music on Grace For Drowning; slightly sinister as always, with great melodies and wonderful production standards. This is a must-have for all fans of Porcupine Tree, Steven Wilson, or progressive music in general. Combining elements of jazz, metal, balladry, and electronica, this is a very eclectic piece of work. It takes time to digest such tracks as \\"RAIDER II\\" and \\"Remainder the Black Dog,\\" but when this occurs, it's quite easy to realize how truly groundbreaking this album is. It's somewhat comparable to Wilson's first solo release, 'Insurgentes,' but is perhaps a bit more mature and focused.  Thank you Steven Wilson for making another great album. This one will go down in history. 5/5
B0031YJFCQ|1.0|What hype with all three books. The story line which could have been exciting, should have been condensed into one book. The Swedish films were far superior to the books. Which is usually not the case.
0385344325|5.0|Not only is this 'classic' Reacher, it is one of the best, it is the prequel to the 1st Reacher novel, \\"Killing Floor\\" and answers the biggest problem I've had with the Reacher stories. Just how the hell does Reacher end up exactly where he does at the start of the 1st book. It's not random. Everything that happens in \\"The Affair\\" fits perfectly into the storyline.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I really don't understand all the flack this Blu-Ray has been getting.  I know some people are disappointed in some of the things that were added to the original trilogy, but not me, I love it.  I'm glad Lucas added something extra to this release, it then makes me feel like I am not paying for the same movies again with no added benefit.  All six movies look stunning and sound amazing.  I am so happy with this release, probably the best thing I bought all year.  For those who are whining about some of the very subtle changes, it may be time to get a girlfriend so you can enjoy other things in life such as arguing.
034552554X|3.0|When I first started this book, I loved it - loved the idea, the plot, the heroine.  I was sure it was going to be my next book club suggestion.  Then - be warned, spoilers here - I started really disliking how hard she worked to push everyone who cared about her away.  As one reviewer has stated, Victoria is a very frustrating heroine.  Granted, I don't know what it's like to walk in the shoes of someone with her background, but it was very frustrating to read how badly she treated everyone who was kind to her.  I also didn't understand Elizabeth's seemingly out of nowhere 180 degree personality change the morning of the adoption.  Then what totally turned me off was what happened after the baby came, I thought it was completely unrealistic how much that baby ate and how that whole section played out.  At that point I put the book down and didn't pick it up for almost 2 weeks.  Thankfully she gets past this and it gets better, but then the end miraculously - and again, kind of out of nowhere - ties up nicely.  You don't really see a transition why she changes her mind, she just does.  Great concept, but the execution lost me.
0393338398|5.0|I am Scottish and know nothing about baseball but this book was absolutely riveting. Lewis has a brilliant style. His understanding of the politics of baseball was excellent. After seeing the film i went back and read the book again and enjoyed it just as much.
B001LNOOG6|2.0|I read all of his books and this is very slow and disappointing.  Plus it has a lot of cussing like a lot of using the f word.  I know he is developing characters but it's a bit over board.  I am half way through the book and am not enjoying it like I usually do with Archer's books.  I'm not sure if I will last for the finale.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Yeah yeah yeah, the Blu-ray 3D looks good. Ooh, wah. Don't have a 3D TV. Got this version because it comes with a Digital Copy and the regualer Blu-ray combo doesn't.  Anyway, what can I say that no one else hasn't said? It's the freakin' LION KING! Millions of people's childhood's are personified by the very existence of this movie. It's a classic. And the Blu-ray quality of this movie is truly something that has to be seen. And if you got surround sound then this movie will give it a work out. HD only helps this movie's audio and songs. \\"Be Prepared\\" and \\"Circle of Life\\" blast to life in what can only be labeled, The Best Diamond Edition to Ever Be Released.  Buy it before it goes back into the Vault.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This is a great British comedy and was a lot of fun to watch!  We had seen them a long time back but decided to watch them again.  It is a nice break from the same old type of comedy shows here in the states.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have all of the Jane Eyre movies and this one staring Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson, is the best one yet, including the 2011 movie release. The movie is visually stunning. The cinematography, is amazing. The acting between Edward Rochester (Toby Stephens) and Jane Eyre (Ruth Wilson) was very believable. I was convinced that Ruth Wilson was indeed Jane Eyre and that Toby Stephens was Edward Rochester. Their love came right at you and made you feel how much in love they were and the friendship they shared was also believable. Watching the movie you really get the sense that they are true soul mates and can't be separated from one another. Masterpiece Theater has followed the book very closely and that also adds to it being the best Jane Eyre movie to date. The only criticism I have is the casting of Adele, she looks way to old for the part of young Adele that's in the books and her acting was pretty bad. But even with this fault the high caliber of the other actors give this movie a 5 star plus if I could. If you are only looking to buy one Jane Eyre movie, This is Diffidently the One!! Skip all the rest and go for this one!! VERY WELL DONE!!!
0385344325|2.0|I am a big fan of the Jack Reacher novels. I was excited to start The Affair.I kept waiting for the excitement,never found it. Far too much repetitive detail and a weak story line. In the future,I will check the paperback version at the bookstore,in order to see if the next Reacher novel is worth reading,before I bother with the Kindle version. Perhaps publishers want books pumped out too fast and the quality suffers.

B004MNVKVO|5.0|This is my 1st Blu Ray Audio only disk, and I must say I am impressed. I hope this becomes a more popular format for Audio, as I am for one interested in obtaining more of these disks.   This is by far the best sounding most dynamic version of this title I have heard so far.  I even prefer it over my DVD Audio version, but to be fair it is probably my Sony BDP-S1 Blu Ray players sound I prefer over my Denon 2910 DVD Audio/SCACD player, Although the Denon handles the bass slam a little better, the overall presentation on the Sony Blu Ray player is more defining, and less grainy. The 5.1 playback on both versions is very listenable, but its the 2 Channel playback where the Denon loses in the contest most dramaticaaly.    However I do like the video interaction better on the Blu Ray version as compared to the DVD-Audio version. More information and displays lyrics and scrolls while the music is playing.    Overall I highly recommend this Blu Ray Audio only disk if you are a Rush fan you will not be dissapointed.
0393064476|4.0|Stephen Greenblatt writes beautifully.  A literary cicerone, he is able to illuminate historical scenes for the modern reader: insights fly from the deft interplay of his sources.    His treatment of Lucretius' De Rerum Natura is excellent; his tale of the manuscript's near loss and chancy recovery is thrilling.  It pains me to say that his view of the Catholic Church is vulgar to the core...in some aspects, Greenblatt has rewritten \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" to his own tastes, and has cast himself as a latter-day Robert Langdon.  As a Roman Catholic, I take my anti-clericalism neat, in the best Irish fashion, and don't need it watered down by insipid pseudo-history.  Feh.  Let's end on a positive note by saying that Greenblatt is a true Renaissance scholar in that he is a deep reader and a resourceful one; he is both academic and practical: he questions the text for its own sake and for the difference that it can make in our lives.

B000001FV1|5.0|This is one of my favorite Traffic albums. It's quite varied, blending elements of blues, jazz, folk and rock. It's also what I would call a moody album; each song has it's own unique atmosphere of sorts. Some are upbeat, some are melancholy and some manage to be both.   First, there's the title track, \\"Shootout At The Fantasy Factory,\\" one of the hardest rocking songs I've heard from Traffic. It has somewhat odd lyrics that were, in a way, a hint of things to come on their following album, \\"When The Eagle Flies,\\" which has some songs with similarly odd lyrics. This song combines some good old fashioned hard rock electric guitar with the flute. This might seem to be a strange combination, but the band made it work, and it sounds great. \\"Roll Right Stones\\" is much more mellow and has a very spiritual feel and sound to it. It's the longest track on the album. My only complaint with this one-a minor complaint-is that it's rather sparse lyrically, considering it's length. Musically, though, it's an excellent song. \\"Evening Blue\\" is a melancholy yet beautiful song about being lonely. The music here sets the mood perfectly for the lyrics. Chris Wood delivers an excellent saxophone solo on this one, and it's my favorite song on the album. \\"Tragic Magic\\" is a purely instrumental number that has kind of a slow, jazzy/bluesy sound. It's unusual, but unique and thoroughly enjoyable. The album concludes with \\"Sometimes I Feel So Uninspired,\\" a song about being discouraged with the hardships of life while trying to find the courage and strength to soldier on anyway. Here again, the music and Steve Winwood's tone, which both change as the song progresses, fit the lyrics perfectly.  It's very important to note that there are distinct differences between the remastered version of this album and the old version. \\"Sometimes I Feel So Uninspired\\" is slightly longer and sounds only slightly different on the remaster. \\"Roll Right Stones\\" is longer, and there are portions of the song that sound VERY different on the old version compared to the remaster. So different, in fact, that they took me by surprise when I first heard them. I kept my old version even after I got the remastered version.  In summary, this is a really great Traffic album. Some will argue that it's not as creative as it's predecessor, \\"The Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys,\\" but I think it is, just in a slightly different way.

0375703764|5.0|If you enjoy a good thriller, mystery, or character driven story then you seriously HAVE to read this book.  Danielewski paints a crazy, chilling story of a House that simply should not exist.  This book will make you not trust your senses.  It will make you cringe, cry, laugh out loud, and hide under your covers.  Warning:  If you read this book in public, there is a good chance people will think you are crazy, or just don't know how to read books, as they see you reading upside down, sideways, or even constantly turning to book in circles in order to read a maddening story, slowly spiraling toward the center of the page..  READ IT!
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|...SAVE OFTEN.  The second you feel the game begin to \\"chug,\\" *save*.  It will die on you quite quickly.  You can expect this to happen every half hour to 45 minutes.  Also save after every good loot, or level up...just get into a habit of reflexively saving.  Also, don't bother trying to find a walkthrough - one doesn't exist yet, and most of the time your failures in the boss fights can be rectified by merely using the knowledge of the boss' attacks to plan better.  One tip I *will* give you however is that in the level for the final \\"crystal\\" (not the final level itself), your main spellcaster's main damage spell will become worth nothing - it's light based, as are all the enemies in the \\"palace.\\"  The palace also contains the \\"Wizard\\" tablet for the spellcaster which has an endgame spell that sounds like this game's \\"Ultima.\\"  Also, you'll get \\"kits\\" throughout the game for your tank - when you're going into this \\"sky palace\\" you'll want him using the one that contains \\"Britburn\\" for flying enemies.  I haven't gotten to the end boss of the level but it's pretty safe to assume the guy's going to fly.
0553381695|3.0|I find this series to be interesting so far. It has interesting characters, sometimes unexpected plot twists, intrigue, and promises of more secrets to be revealed. Unfortunatley, though I can understand the need for some descriptions of brutality for the sake of realism, I felt it heald way more than necessary. The backstory is well developed and thought out, and despite what some reviewers are saying, I appreciate having the story unfold from different points of view. I actually found Stannis and Jon to be the more boring story tellers in this installment, but they were both still worth reading. One thing I was glad to see was Sansa, Bran and Arya's goings on told in detail, as they are becoming my favorite characters. For people thinking about reading this book, I would advise patience and to pay attention to what you're reading, because I believe some readers who've given reviews didn't pay attention and that's why they're frustrated. It does start out slow, but is worth continuing on with, despite the vivid descriptions of violence against women, which is my biggest gripe with this series. For those with more empathetic dispositions, this book can be hard to stomach due to it's extremely vivid and recurring theme of rape and infanticide, much of which I believe added nothing to the story and in fact detracted from it and made it hard to read at times. Like one reviewer said, there are mostly 3 types of women included in this series (save the main characters and those alone) and those are all described in reference to their use to men, whether as diversions from battle or vicitms of it. I understand that these unfortunate types of things happened, but they needn't be described and mentioned every other chapter, as I felt they were. Any women who are not victims are, on the opposite end of the spectrum, threats to masculinity itself.(That is, women with power.) Some might argue that a good number of men in this series are hurt, tortured and murdered, which is true( quite a bit of which isn't needed) but none of them are raped in front of and by entire villages and then given no sympathy by their peers(assuming they even survive) as one character is.Nor are descriptions of their bodies, sexual practices, or sexuality constantly referred to either by the narrator or character's in the story. CONSTANTLY. I understand that the author is male, and that the world the series takes place in is highly patriarchal and ruled  for the most part  by males, but this constant surmising of the majority of female characters by the most base sum of their parts may just have a tendency to alienate female readers, which in the end isn't good business. Include realistic events, occasionally describe them to provide grittines and atmosphere if necessary, but don't rub it in our faces. That being said, I plan to continue with the series and atleast read the next installment. Hopefully the author will continue to give each character a chance to tell their own tale, and keep the plot thickening without un-necessary descriptions of violence.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Second (extras) disc was faultily omitted.  When I told the shipper, he apologized and told me to keep the disc (the actual film) that WAS sent and he refunded my credit card.  The movie is excellent [[ASIN:B0034G4P7G The Social Network (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]; I subsequently got the complete 2-disc set from Half.com at the same low price so I'm quite satisfied.

Now broke, I am incredibly excited about this book -- it speaks to me as a scientist, laying out how to perform a synthesis of the scientific method with vision and hard work. I feel for the first time that start-up management isn't just a black box of bluster and magic. Thank you Eric Ries!
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I got this set to replace my DVD's, i read how it was all so much better and with the HD audio. When I got the set, I was dissapointed in eppisodes I-III, they didnt look that nice, and the audio was no improvement just about the only improvement was less pixelization in action scenes. episodes IV through VI were better, which justified the purchase for me. the extra features were fun too.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|I saw this movie twice before from DVD's I borrowed and I just had to own it. I've told people about it and wanted to show it to friends. And I want to see it again and again! It is so very honest. I was a bit surprised that Metallica let it come out. It doesn't always show them in the best light. It shows their emotions and passion and their very dynamic, creative personalities. Even if you don't like their music, you will enjoy this inside look into the lives of one of the most famous bands in the world.

B002VECLVO|5.0|It's your last day. What would you do? For professor George Falconer the answer is easy: retrieving important documents, closing bank accounts, writing letters to his friends as well as his last will. With unflinching actions and melancholic gestures, Colin Firth creates a most enthralling character, imbued by the sheer emotion of loss and yet adjusted to the repressed feelings he considers necessary to suppress even in his last day. After losing his partner and lover, there is no deterrence in his decision: he will kill himself at the end of the day.<br /><br />How then could he spend his last 24 hours? Many would have extravagant and unordinary ideas, but the truth is that George Falconer upholds his daily routine facing this day as any other. He wakes up, takes a shower, gets dressed, drives to university, teaches his last class and decides to join his old friend Charlie (amazingly interpreted by Julianne Moore) for supper. Tom Ford's remarkable film takes Christopher Isherwood's novel and turns it into a tour de force in which emotions and the human condition are on full display.<br /><br />Everything seems different when you realize you are watching things for the last time. And so George finally lets go, acting and speaking to people in ways he had not even considered before. Through constant flashbacks, the viewer catches a few glances of the relationship George had with Jim. They had been together for 16 years and if not for a fatal accident they would still be together. Can life lose all meaning once we lost our loved ones? It certainly would seem like it; George finds himself not only disgruntled but also devoid of any hope. He dreads tomorrow. And why should he inflict himself with the torture of existing, day after day, if existence has proved to be so painful and dire? Some answers can be found in Slavoj Zizek and Jacques Lacan theories; more specifically in the notions of real and symbolic death. Evidently, we will suffer a biological death in which our bodies will fail and eventually disintegrate, that's what happens with Jim. This death occurs in the Real, and it entails the obliteration of our material selves. But we can also suffer a Symbolic death that has nothing to do with the annihilation of our actual bodies, but rather the destruction of our Symbolic universe and the extermination of our subject positions. Whenever people remember our names, remember our deeds and so on we continue to exist in the Symbolic even though we have died in the Real. Therefore, Jim is not truly dead as George remembers him constantly, but here evocation does not provide the necessary narrative of closure, the grieving process remains incomplete.<br /><br />There is a fissure that separates the two deaths which can be filled either by manifestations of the monstrous or the beautiful. A concept that a Spanish hustler rescues during a conversation with the professor \\"Sometimes awful things have their own kind of beauty\\". That is why the presence of Kenny, Nicholas Hoult's character, is of supreme importance. He is not only the embodiment of beauty but he also provides the companionship George so urgently needs. Only through Kenny and the bonding they start developing will George experience an epiphany (\\"A few times in my life I've had moments of absolute clarity, when for a few brief seconds the silence drowns out the noise and I can feel rather than think, and things seem so sharp and the world seems so fresh\\"). A revelation in which he will understand why is it important to let go of the past, to put the pain away and to take a real risk: to accept life and keep on living.nd eventually disintegrate, that's what happens with Jim.

159102594X|3.0|It took me some time to really get into this book, probably because I've been reading mostly the lighter urban fantasy lately.  However, once I did it turned out to be a pretty good story.  The characters are incredibly varied, and while I'm not sure I could say I liked any of them, they were very interesting to read.    This first book of the trilogy was more providing background than anything else.  All the main characters had to be brought together so that they could leave together, plus Abercrombie had to introduce the world and its politics.  The Blade Itself is a slightly more difficult read because of this; explanations weren't always explicit for the various countries and people described, though by about the middle of the book I had a lot of it figured out.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  As I've said before, I'd rather figure things out myself than have the author insert an awkward conversation explaining things the characters obviously already know.  I'm still a little unclear on some of the mythology, but I certainly understood enough to follow the story.  Back to my original point.  Because of the whole bringing-the-characters together thing, the book started off slowly, but it improved a great deal once the background was established.  Action-packed and harrowing, this book does an excellent job of mixing fighting with political intrigue, decadence with hardship.  The Blade Itself is far less romantic than a lot of older fantasy series (though not quite as gritty as A Song of Ice and Fire).  Overall, a decent start to what I hope will be an excellent series.
B004LWZW42|5.0|This is a smart, interesting, and entertaining take on the famous X-Men series.  Great acting and a great plot make this movie a must see to \\"Superhero\\" fans.  I won't get into the plot since it has been told on reviews here, but the special effects are outstanding and the story holds your interest throughout the movie.  Highly recommended!
B005ELZKWS|5.0|This album is Sammy's best in 30 years.  The chemistry between these 4 is much better than he had with VH.  I believe the biggest reason is because everyone is having fun.  When you love your job, you produce.  Great job Chickenfoot.  I love every song. NICE!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am a bit surprised at the number of very low reviews for this 5th installment of the series. (?!) I cannot agree with those that say this book was a huge disappointment. Perhaps if I had waited 5 years or more, for the \\"exciting conclusion\\" I could see it, this is NO conclusion - but I read all 5 volumes over the summer on my Kindle - and honestly, the line between the end of one volume and the beginning of the next becomes a bit blurred that way.<br /><br />I was enthralled with the entire story...INCLUDING the so-called \\"diversions\\" of the Ironmen, the slow pace of change in Dani's world, and even the journey taken in vain by Brienne. In fact, that \\"side plot\\" I found fascinating, and felt that I was along for every painful step with her small group for the journey.<br /><br />So many negative reviewers have complained about the non-character chapter names. But, in fact, the new names for chapters about old characters are themselves very insightful. And how can folks complain about Martin's long and detailed descriptions of the heraldry, family histories and long-ago events?? This is part of what makes his world so complete and detailed! It's like reading LOTR AND The Simarillion together.<br /><br />I don't understand the cutting criticisms of Martin's recurring character motifs like \\"You know nothing, Jon Snow\\" or \\"\\"If I look back, I'm lost\\". Yes, they appear a lot - no, it's not \\"repetitive\\" - any more than are the things that we ALL have coming back to haunt us in our memories from time to time. When something that we see or hear, has a huge impact on us, it causes us to re-think it over and over, perhaps for the rest of our lives.<br /><br />I have many such memories and voices from the past that I live with.<br /><br />Nor am I tired of the descriptions of the ravens landing on Jon Snow each chapter. I LOVE them. The ravens are a constant link to the past, they landed on him right from the start. I LIKE the repetitive quotes of \\"Hodor!\\", and I LIKE the slow-paced minutae of the hour by hour struggle through snow, forest or swamp...I have not personally found one boring moment in this narrative...or, if there is some times where the action is slower and the land is quietly patient, it only adds to the realism of a world ravaged by war, and trying to slowly recover!<br /><br />In short, this last installment was every bit as enjoyable to me as ANY of the first 4. Unless a reader is really just looking for more battle scenes or hand to hand combat with the undead, or just \\"more of the same\\" as the first books, this volume is EVERY BIT as rewarding as any of the others. In fact, I actually count it, and the many subtle suprises (Like, who was sent to find Jon's sister!) - and it's relentless march towards the upcoming climaxes - to be my favorite of the 5!<br /><br />So, it feels odd to see so many 1 and 2/5 reviews - I'm frankly astounded. I might be because, although I am an avid reader, I have NOT read many of these \\"multi-volume\\" fantasy series, and am not so aware of what these readers expect. Dune, Cities in Flight and LOTR are about the only others I can recall. And I tend to view those series as a \\"whole\\", not several parts of a whole.<br /><br />I give this volume, a Dance with Dragons\\", 5/5: I thought it was fantastic - I had never even HEARD of GRRM until last summer, and I couldn't put it down from the start of volume 1 to the end of volume 5, and it never would have occured to me to \\"skim\\" the outlying bits, or subplots, as many have suggested (??)...not one word!
B005HGZV6U|2.0|I didn't want the reviews on Amazon to be right, but they are: the Blu-Ray release of Daft Punk and Leiji Matsumoto's masterpiece is flawed, to say the very least. Even with my Blu-Ray player's smoothing in place, there are a lot of artifacts and the entire thing looks like it was shot through gauze.  My theory is that Interstella 5555 was originally mastered and edited for 480p and they never bothered to edit the film for higher resolutions or projection, which is something that's affected many anime and live-action TV series.<br /><br />I would recommend just sticking with the DVD version: [[ASIN:B0000E6XH3 Daft Punk - Interstella 5555]], particularly as the \\"extras\\" on this disc are next to non-existent.
0316098329|5.0|Room is a hauntingly beautiful heartbreaking story.  I couldn't put it down. It is told from the perspective of a recently turned five year old boy, Jack.  Jack who is prone to not using \\"articles\\" such as the, an and a- essentially names everything in his presence, for example not THE sink but Sink. This simple tactic of Donoghue's almost humanizes all of Jack's Spartan surroundings in an 11x11 room, in which he was born and had literally has been raised in captivity.  Room quickly draws the reader into what can only be described as a nightmare for his mother and everyday life for him. However his mother has a silver lining to her cloud in Jack.  She has created a world for him in Room that is probably only tolerable for her due to Jack's existence.  The innocence of the boy not having ever experienced life outside a shed and the heart wrenching struggles of his mother who was kidnapped at 19 as seen through the eyes of Jack leave the reader aching. Just the way his mother handled TV watching is gripping, doling it out in half an our increments so as not to rot his brain, not watching commercials, allowing him to believe stores and other people are make believe. And calling his mother \\"gone,\\" whenever she fell into the low chemistry of depression and slept the day away made me literally want to hug him.  SPOILER COMING UP SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T READ    His world is literally turned upside down when he escapes and aids in his mother's escape.  The world to which he escapes is more frightening to him than the only place he has ever been and he longs for the sheltered simplicity of Room where the only two people he has ever seen outside of the television are his mother and her captor.  The sensory overload he experiences when being removed from room is done with finesse. His fear of things that normal children think are pedestrian (syrup) versus his bravery and curiosity at things that actually pose a danger (bees) is remarkably well thought out.  Him trying to replicate his security and happiness in Room in the room number 7 in the hospital was heartbreaking.  His attachment to gender specific items in a non gender specific way such as his long hair, breastfeeding and Dora the Explorer reflect what a gender divided sexualized society we live in and how those gender biases are non existent when you have nothing in which to compare them. Another thing that stood out for me was his attachment with his mother's extracted tooth, his need to carry a piece of her no matter how much that tooth represented pain and suffering to her, to him it was just her. In the same way he carried his affection for Room which represented pain to her as well but for him it was just his whole world.  I can only imagine those who did not give this book 4 or more stars probably don't have children, and don't understand sacrifices made to keep those children occupied and happy. Overall Room was one of the best novels I think I have ever read in that it will stay with you a long time.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This was a pretty good book.  THE GOOD. The Son of neptune was a lot of action and detail. Also there was good characters. Percy is back.  THE BAD. The kindle version has a LOT of typos.  ADVICE. Do not get kindle version.  I highly recomend this book.
1419702203|5.0|Not a review per se, just a quick tip to Beatle fans...  I just spent a half hour leafing through this hefty volume, and if you're on the fence about buying yet another Beatle book, I assure you... trust me... this is an absolutely gorgeous volume of the very highest quality, beautifully produced, full of unseen images.  Well worth the investment. You'll keep it forever.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Slipknot, but this album is by far their best. It eliminates all of the profanity I didn't approve of from the previous two albums, although there are just a few minor \\"profane\\" words. The music is fantastic, and that's something really good for an album like this. Also, Corey Taylor works very hard on his vocals, and he puts a lot of effort into his yells in the songs. I really hope they can keep it up if their band gets back together after Paul Gray, the bassist, was killed by a heart attack. I really hope they make another album like this.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars

Well I got home I knew my son was going to be excited, and I gave him the book and he smiled from ear to ear. This is going on the 2nd day that he has the book and guess what he's also done with it. WOW! I want to say thank you to the seller for the book and the speedy service, I will be sure to buy from you again. Thank you. You have made my son very happy.

0385344325|3.0|It was interesting to read about how/why Reacher got tossed from the Army, but for some reason this book didn't click as much as the \\"current\\" Reacher books. It was worth reading, if you have gotten hooked. I suspect that those who read this first will be unhappy with the earlier books - simply because Reacher is much more complex and interesting as he gets older.  I am still looking forward to seeing how he is doing, health wise. I really like the last book, and want more \\"old\\" Reacher. He is so much more discrete in his sex life when he is older. I really didn't need to hear all about the six times and the train, seemed very repetitious,  But hey, it is a Reacher book, so it can't be all bad.
B000YDG5X4|1.0|I'll keep this brief:  The boots look nice. But...  The sizing associated with this boot is nowhere near - and I'm talking 1.5 full sizes off of - my normal Timberland shoe size. (I even ordered these Earthkeepers 1/2 size smaller than usual due to reviews others have already posted.)  I paid for expedited delivery so that I'd have these for a trip, and now I'm not only going to be without these boots for my trip (due to having to return them), but I'm out my shipping costs, and Amazon is even charging me for return shipping. Even though it is Amazon who is selling a product that is nowhere near the actual size it is labeled to be.
B005SZAEYO|1.0|I thought the ad campaign with the various horror movie musical themes was irritating, I saw the Glee/Nip Tuck creators' names on it and lost even more interest. But something about that image of Connie Britton and the guy in the gimp suit on the ceiling unnerved me and drew my curiousity. I figured it couldn't hurt to try despite the terrible reviews. I had to try.    Take the title of this review as making a long story short. Don't.     This is a truly wretched show. Over the top, tone deaf crap. A pretty good definition of throw s*** at the wall and see what sticks. A bunch of admittedly unnerving imagery randomly thrown together and given a cliche plot, this show isn't worth your time.
B004WR125O|5.0|Here's my impression after 10 minutes of unboxing.  It took me longer to get my Pandora email/password entered than it did to plug this into my TX-NR709 receiver.  It also took me a few minutes to figure out how to connect the device to my router.  I was expecting to have to enter my wireless network password, that's how I connect my TV and blu-ray player.  This device is different, easier actually.  I have a D-Link DIR-655 router so this won't apply verbatim:  After loggin to the Web Interface, under the Setup/Wireless Settings menu i've got a \\"Add Wireless Device with WPS\\" button.  I chose \\"Auto\\" and manually entered the PIN number supplied from the setup menu on the receiver.    Once I figured out where the menu was in my Router, the whole connection process took less than 2 minutes.  Once connected the receiver estimates signal strength.  Mine says 57%.  I thought that sounded really low.  However, I had no issues streaming music from Pandora or Mediafly.  My router is located about 40 feet away with 2 walls in between.
1401324517|4.0|If You've ever wanted to get inside the mind of Rafa Nadal, this self titled autography is a good place to start.<br /><br />At only 25 years old, Rafa is already a career slam winner, one of the youngest to accomplish this feat, as well as a six time French Open champ. But, what makes him tick? Is the warrior who fights like a demon for each and every point the real Rafa? Or are there deeper levels to his persona previously undisclosed?<br /><br />Would you be surprised to learn he loves to cook during tennis tournaments, whenever possible in an effort to relieve the tension with which he struggles at such times? That he's afraid of thunder and lightening? That, despite winning those six French Open titles, Wimbledon is his favorite tournament?<br /><br />This book reveals aspects of Rafa's personality hitherto unknown and delicious to learn. It's worth reading just to get Rafa's analysis of his 2008 Wimbledon classic final against, then world number one, Roger Federer in a match that sportscasters from around the world have hailed as the greatest tennis match ever (as well as the longest in Wimbledon history).<br /><br />Personally, I've enjoyed watching Rafa play for years, the passion he brings to the sport is unparalleled, but I never guessed what the man behind the myth was truly like. This book has been a revelation. Highly enjoyable read.
B005FNPIG8|4.0|For a movie plagued with pre production problems such as this one,where Van Damme`s proposed co-star Steven Seagal dropped out and the story`s premise was re-written,it is a wonder the film came out as well as it did.Starring along with Van Damme is Scott Rudin(X men Origins:Wolverine) and Van Damme`s two siblings,son Kristopher as one of the two corrupt Interpol agents and his daughter Bianca who plays Rudin`s bed ridden wife Anna Flint.Again Van Damme and company have picked a good solid group of actors and behind-the-camera crew so that the results are quite good.<br />The plot involves the head of Interpol,under investigation for selling and profiting through illegal arms sales.There is an open end he wants closed,in the form of an assassin for hire named Roland Flint.Flint took the proceeds from a sale gone bad and went into hiding after his wife was brutally raped(and left in a coma)and Flint himself almost killed,by a local Romanian thug by the name of Polo.Simultaneously we have another assassin for hire in the picture and his name is Vincent Brazil(Van Damme).Brazil`s oft used contact for jobs gives him the assignment of coincidentally killing Polo.At the same time Flint is also given the job by an old Interpol contact,but does not know who his target is or that there is another involved.Flint`s job is in actuality a ruse by the head of Interpol and two agents in on his corruption scheme,to snuff out Flint so they can get rid of their loose end once and for all.<br />The moment of truth arrives as Polo is set up above and across of the assassination location.Out walks Polo,Flint lines his shot and fires but hits the roof of a small truck as it rounds the corner and into his line of fire.The driver is none other than Brazil who,distracted by Flint`s shot,misses and kills Polo`s only brother instead,speeding off.Frustrated Polo comes downstairs,gun in hand and walks towards the startled crowd.As he lifts his weapon to fire the two Interpol agents in a car near the scene,fire knocking the gun out of his hand.This creates enough of a diversion to enable Flint to escape.Polo is of course bent on revenge and finding out who killed his brother,Flint is more enraged than ever because his target is his old nemesis and he missed,Brazil is mad because of the interloper who cost him a kill and Interpol STILL wants Flint silenced.<br />Brazil catches up to Flint and they briefly have a Mexican stand off in a warehouse.They hash out their differences and decide to work together to bring Polo down.However Polo is not standing still and has his men searching for any clues to Brazil and his whereabouts and distributing pictures of him all over town.Eventually it is a disgruntled neighbour of Brazil`s that discloses his whereabouts.Also Brazil`s jobs contact has offered him a substantial remuneration if he turns his new `partner`(Flint) in.All he has to do is get him to a location and the rest will be done by the ``employer``.Brazil at this point has no idea of the Interpol connection(the ``employer``in this case),Polo`s involvement with them or with Flint`s history with either.Polo`s appearance is the ruse to again lure Flint out and Flint is captured with little struggle as Brazil looks coldly on,another job done.<br />Flint is taken to a remote warehouse and tortured for info on the whereabouts of the money he took from them long ago.Brazil has had time to think and approaches his jobs man once again and asks for the location of the warehouse.Brazil has now absorbed enough information to determine the connections and that he was set up and in turn set up his ``partner`` and does not like it.He rescues Flint and they kill the interrogating Interpol agents.Next on the list is Polo himself,but he is seemingly one step ahead and he has found Flint`s home and is with his comatose wife,threatening to kill her altogether this time.This brings Flint and Brazil back to Flint`s home and together unarmed,they are forced to walk into Polo`s clutches.Polo is delighted at the thought of being able to take care of two birds with one stone but he hasn`t counted on the resourcefulness of the pair.Flint had previously installed a high powered remote controlled rifle outside his home and with the touch of a remote laying on the table(which Polo thought was nothing but a phone),it gives them the distraction they both need to get the upper hand and bring control to their situation.Polo is the last alive,defiant to the end and Brazil leaves him with Flint as he steps outside for air.When Flint rejoins Brazil,Brazil says there is one more thing left to do;actually one thing each.Flint takes down the head of Interpol and Brazil takes out the disgruntled neighbour who squealed to Polo about where he lived.The film ends as we see Flint talking to a medical specialist about an important operation for his wife and as Brazil lights a candle in a church for a dead friend and leaves.<br />Both Brazil and Flint are characters that are fleshed out very nicely,and as a result two people we can easily identify with.Flint`s life as a hired gun,was totally shattered since the day he,and especially his wife was attacked and she was put into a permanent bed ridden state;and his face and mannerisms show it.He lives day to day in a protective mode;a loving husband dutifully looking after his partner.Brazil on the other hand is a hired gun like Flint,but the years of killing and torment show in his well worn face.He is a methodical man as we see when he first comes home and straightens little items up in his apartment as he goes through it.He has no personal life and is very much the loner.With these characters fleshed out as they are and expanded on wonderfully by Van Damme and Rudin,there is no where to go but up.The two,though similar are very different,but they blend together well when the rubber hits the road.Polo,played with great menace and panache by Ivan Kaye,is also a welcome protagonist for the two along with the Interpol chief.To give the movie an even better dynamic the entire movie was filmed in a filtered or sepia-like colour tone.Nice.<br />Technically speaking the movie looks clear and crisp and is in its original a/r of 1:85:1.Extras include the trailer,previews and some deleted scenes.<br />Another nice vehicle for Van Damme who has Scott Rudin along for the ride this time, and who comes up to the challenge with extra to spare.The entire cast is as solid as the writing/plot.Recommended.lighted at the thought of

B003R0MEZ4|5.0|as far as the show itself goes, these are my people and i have every season thus far.  i love them all, and am superbly happy with the product, came new,  no scratches, good job.  what i didnt like, is that they were messing with the casting so much:  this one is gone, this one staying, oh wait that one may come back, but that one hasnt signed their contract yet.  i am going to be honest, i do not blame the actors in any way for the drama outside of actually shooting.  i blame the millionaires  who are the producers or execs, or whatever name they use for the credits roll.  granted, the show wouldn't be on the air but for them, but if they[[ASIN:B003R0MEZ4 Criminal Minds: The Sixth Season]] want to make bigger profits, they should try to make the fans happy.  having a little controversy is healthy, i will admit, but what went on this year, and leading to the new season, silly.
B0055SWM08|5.0|really like this one, uses just enough brain power to challenge me, but not enough that it isn't relaxing still.
0399213015|5.0|The very hungry cateplillar, I purchased for my son (nearly 4 years old). He likes the book and up till now he still wants to look at the book before he goes to sleep. (more than 12 days already!)
B004EPYZQC|4.0|The title for this ongoing sequel to Fast and Furious is, it seems, related to the number of films based on this fast driving bunch of car fanatics than to the number of people in the tribe. What makes this series of Pow and Wow action flicks stand above many of its competitors is the tremendous sense of fun the cast seems to be having - leaping over rooftops, driving fast cars, pulling off impossible heists. It all ends in a sense of fun and introduces the teaser for the next in the series (a bit with Eva Mendes and Jason Mignot in a brief talk after the credits run pretty much guarantees the next installment).<br /><br />This time the guys and girls - Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel), his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), her boyfriend ex-cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Vince (Matt Schulze), Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (Ludacris), Han Lue (Sung Kang), Gisele Harabo (Gal Gadot) Tego Leo (Tego Calderon), and Rico Santos (Don Omar) - gather in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - each in various stages of running from the past - hunted by FBI Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and in desperate need for money to escape Rio to countries where they cannot be extradited. They discover the one last job opportunity - taking away the money that billionaire Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) takes from the money houses in the infamous Rio favelas district.  It takes the talent of the entire crew to make the heist of heists as the safe where the illegal money is kept is in the police station in a huge vault that is impenetrable - until our gang takes over in likely the most interesting and entertaining chase scene on film.  The rest of the story is fluff but nice - with a little love interest thrown in for good measure.  This cast is strong and they pull of the fine line between comedy and drama very well.  In the end this is a fast and entertaining escape film. And #6  will probably come soon!  Grady Harp, October 11
0205632645|5.0|I bought this book because I have a thing for hard cover. I saw some earlier reviews that the quality of the paper might not be satisfying, but I decided to give it a try. When I got the book, it was great! I have to say that guy must have been really picky to criticize it. I love it!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Addicting and super fun trying to get all three stars for every level, and annoying when you can't :P Plus, the little guy looks sooo sad when you drop his candy! Very well done guys.
0062060554|1.0|Other reviews have accurately described the overhyped horror of this novel. It is not in the least original. A graceless rendering of \\"50 First Dates\\", without the charm, and \\"Wait Until Dark\\" with memory loss substituted for blindness. The heroine's illness is poorly rendered, and the whole setup of the novel (no one cares until the very end, then everyone cares) is absurd. The behavior of the doctor who propels her journal writing simply doesn't make any sense, except that the novelist needed it to be that way. The long boring 300 page slog to get to the conclusion is not rewarded by any breathtaking revelation but by foreshadowing that takes all mystery out of the ending. The story is so convoluted that the author has to spend five pages at the end \\"explaining\\" everyones aberrant behavior. Just nonsense. At least I didn't waste more than one evening on this book.
B0018TLRTK|5.0|Pretty good CD.  About half of the material is decent or great.  The CD arrived in fine shape other than some chalk dust on it from the box of chalk I ordered.
B0052WSX32|5.0|You often hear sports announcers speculate on whether Babe Ruth could hit modern pitching or whether or not Ben Hogan would be challenging Tiger Woods today if he were the same age and using the same equipment.  Similarly, when hearing singers from Doris Day's era sound so graceful and appropriate in delivering the music from their time, I've often wondered what those same singers would sound like if they were to record newer songs with more contemporary arrangements and instrumentation.  It turns out that a great singer is a great singer, and Doris Day can make any song her own with her unique ability to caress a lyric.  Ms. Day was in her early 60's when she recorded most of these songs in the mid-1980's, and these sessions found her in fine voice.  The sound quality of the tracks is excellent.  Hearing these recordings for the first time in 2011 is quite a treat.  Her spoken intro to the penultimate track, which is sung by her son, Terry Melcher, sounds to have been recently recorded.  All in all, my assessment of Doris Day's \\"My Heart\\" is that it is a moving, finely crafted album that is also a breath of fresh air from the past.
B004M5HB74|4.0|La Roux (Gold Edition) wouldn't be the album someone would want to buy if they wanted to hear La Roux for the first time.  Basically the whole album is remixes, b-sides, and a couple songs that didn't make it to the album.  If you're a first time La Roux listener, I would recommend La Roux's self-titled album.  There you can really get a feel for the sound of La Roux.  However, if you are an extreme La Roux fan, like me, you will want this CD.    I personally don't feel that La Roux and Kanye West mix well, but the 'In For The Kill' remix is none the less a good remix.  'Under My Thumb' and 'Finally My Saviour' are both great songs.  I love this version of 'Under My Thumb' as the one on Sidetracked was mixed with the track before it, and was a bit faster.  This version does not have excess sound from another song, and has a slower yet rhythmic beat.  'Finally My Saviour' is a song that was a bonus track in the UK, but never made it here in the US, until now.  The lyrics are very driven and the beats are complete with the great La Roux synths are fantastic.  After these tracks, there are mostly remixes, as well as a demo version of 'Tigerlily', an acoustic version of 'Bulletproof' and a lounge version of 'In For The Kill'.  Personally, I love getting physical versions of albums.  I love the physical version of this album, it includes more pictures than \\"La Roux\\" does, and does not feel cheap, even though it is manufactured on demand.  I know that people previously said that the track names are not recognized in music software, but for me on iTunes, it was fine, and all names were recognized.    All in all, if you are a dedicated La Roux fan, I feel you will thoroughly enjoy this album.  If you're a new fan or listener, I wouldn't recommend this, rather I would point you in the direction of the album \\"La Roux\\".
0783229372|5.0|Despite the sometimes cheese effects especially towards the end and the newsreels back and fourth,I actually liked the film and since it is a part of the disaster genre of films in the 1970's I could not pass off on watching instantly.Another compliant would be it drags on,Yes it is a fictionalized account,however I could not pass off on George C.Scott,Who I feel pulls the movie through even through it's most drawn out boring moments and Burgess Meredith(yer'abum rocky!)I simply cannot ignore their performances.It's a product of it's time but A guilty pleasure.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I don't think my life would be complete anymore without this game. It's simple, fun, and addicting. The combination of plants and zombies are great, and the music is very cute too.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|My husband and I travel the country in our motor home and often do not get a good signal for t.v. so we rely on dvd's for evening entertainment. We both enjoy documentories and this one was well worth the price. I have long been a Jackson fan and enjoyed this glimpse into his last panned performance. We buy most of our books and dvd's from amazon.com. A source we can trust.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|was the FAOTD , and is now the most used app on my HTC Inspire . love the style , UI and updates. a must buy for everyone who has overslept .
B000NVL9FQ|5.0|The Shout Factory did indeed get it right on this one.Everything sounds crisp and clear with the drums right up front.. just how I like it.When that drummer is Carl Palmer.It sounds just like it did back in the 70's.Greg Lake's voice back then was fantastic and Emerson is incredible as always.Happy with this purchase.
0062060554|5.0|This book was great. I read it like I was driving a car, before I knew it I was reading the book in 5th gear and did not care about anything else going around me. The book is very well written. My favorite book of the year 2011.
B004ZNARH4|4.0|I recommend making this purchase only if you're a hardcore Floyd fan and I suppose that's their target market with this product. Even if you are, there's still some stuff included in the set that is a bit silly.   Both the Quad and 5.1 mixes are incredible. I briefly sampled them both (On The Run, Time and Us & Them) on my home theatre system and it was very impressive. I plan on kicking my family out for a few hours and listening to them extremely loud and in entirety very soon. I was also very pleased to see the Brighton 1972 stuff included. This is one of my favorite versions of Careful with that Axe and the improvements made to both audio and visual are excellent. I just wish there was more.  The documentary really just seems like filler and I would assume most people buying this are going to know the back story and how the band arrived at Dark Side. I'll summarize on that note. There are some definite high points to the owning the immersion, but it also seems that some stuff was just haphazardly thrown in there at the last minute.
B004YJMQCS|4.0|Out of the three 3D Blu-ray movies I've seen so far (Mummies, The Universe: 7 Wonders, and Clash of the Titans), The Final Destination has the best effects out of the group.  The 3D is very well done, in my opinion.  I love those pop-out effects with the sticks, snake (especially was cool), and other shrapnel.  I've always been a fan of the entire FD series, and this film is no exception.   5 stars from me for the film content.  3D rating is on a scale of 1 star for very poor, 2 for fair, 3 for very good, and 4 for excellent.  This gets a 3 from me in the 3D department, so 4 stars overall.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I concur with the previous reviews.  The product works very well and the sound quality is   very good (I have used both SD cards and the AUX input).  One \\"con\\" I would add is the inability to use playlists.  I used m3u playlists on my MP3  player which contain the songs from multiple albums (i.e. folders) on my SD cards.  This   would have been nice to have on the Soundfly but I can get around that by using the AUX   input and using my MP3 player as the source.  An additional \\"con\\" is the fact that shuffle acts on every MP3 file the unit finds on the  entire SD card.  It would have been nice to be able to just shuffle a folder.  Despite these issues, I would still buy this again.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It's a great, lightweight cutting tool.  I have managed to score and separate several bottles now for a craft project.  I use a hot water/cold water shock method to make the score break.  Once you get the tool together, it is fairly easy to set the height and score the bottle.  It works great with wine bottles, and I imagine - beer or soda bottles.

B0034G4P80|3.0|Having survived the horrors of a slew of butchered comic-to-movie creations (with the odd saving grace here and there...such as the non-Ang Lee Hulk), I'd had low expectations for this, but I was pleasantly surprised. The visuals were absolutely stunning. Hopkins was superb as Odin, I loved the twist on Norse mythology, and the supporting cast was very good as well, especially Kat Dennings (Darcy), who just about stole the show even with as little dialogue as she was given. Granted, it wasn't perfect. The biggest detractor was that the storyline was a bit weak in development. Thor changes from an egotistical hothead to someone willing to sacrifice himself for mortals because he was given the god-equivalent of being sent to his room for a day's worth of \\"time-out\\"? I liked the character of Jane, but I saw very little of what it was about her character that inspired him to want to be more. I guess it could all be laid at the feet of love-at-first-sight, but I was hoping for something less vague. If she'd shown an indominable spirit or overwhelming compassion, it would have made a little more sense. Still, it was an enjoyable romp.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it four stars was b/c of the quality of the dvd I received. I'd first seen this movie in the theater, and thank goodness I did....otherwise I wouldn't have been able to follow along. I couldn't see a thing! The full daylight scenes were o.k., but everything that took place beneath Asgard or on the ice giants' world was nothing but shadow and voices. I adjusted my television's color in countless variations and nothing improved. Tv was working fine...I saw drastic lightening and darkening when I adjusted while watching cable or another dvd. It was like AvP: Requiem all over again. Which is a pity because the visuals are one of the best features of this film. I purchased the single dvd and not the combo pack, if that makes a difference.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I don't understand why people don't like this movie at all either however that is their opinion, mine is I loved it!!! Went to see a movie not expecting a big deal and found myself still to this day freaking out on it I loved it that much. The ending folks if you were not paying attention watch the credits... yep you heard me right, more to the ending with the credits so sit still and wait for it or if you now own it on dvd fast forward to it. I see a possible number two in the future, who knows. Just leave an open mind when watching I thought it was excellent and am waiting very impatiently for this dvd to be available. I thought this movie had great effects love the outfits well made and still reeling from seeing it in the theater. Enjoy the movie, I sure did!!!!!

B004TTMYQG|5.0|been using the free version for a long time-it's amazing. paid version went on sale-it's even better than i imagined. widgets work well, multiple calendar support is seamless, customization options are incredible, drag/drop and shortcuts work well.
0375842209|4.0|What a sad day. I just finished listening to \\"The Book Thief\\" on my way to work. You know how you read some books and just can't wait to find out what comes next? This was not one of those books. It was so beautifully written - stories within stories and the colors that said everything. I love the fact that it is narrated by Death, himself. I enjoyed each of the characters laid out by the author like players in a theatrical performance. But I knew with each passing chapter that things were going to get worse for Liesel Meminger, her family and friends. Some of those things had been foreshadowed by our narrator and others by history. Every day I listened I felt like a part of my heart was ripped away. By the time I arrived at my office I was sobbing. I cried for all who were lost on Himmel Street that day; for the starving Jews who were degradingly paraded through town on their way to certain death at Dachau (and the millions of others not mentioned in this story); for the love of Rudy Steiner that was never acknowledged until it was too late; for the power of words - both good and bad. But what I think is the saddest part of all, is the realization that this cruelty and inhumanity still exists around the world today.

Each song tells a story and will have you smiling and tapping your toes!! Some will tug at your heart like the Old King James!!!or dirty dishes!!! Or upbeat songs like Water Tower Town..Theres a song for everyone to enjoy on this gem treasure!!! If your on the fence and are a true country fan run do not walk and buy this wonderful album you will not be disappointed!!!!
B005SNMR8W|5.0|Another great episode continuing the storyline primarily involving John Teller's incriminating documents. The tension building up in Clay regarding the potential destruction those documents could mean to the club is palpable. I am also enjoying the story arc with Juice trying to keep the closet door from opening exposing his own skeletons.   Great, great episode. No violence - this one is all dialog and character development, but it's a stomach churning ride.
B00005JOA0|5.0|Tara Fitzgerald is excellent in the role of an aloof, unsociable, misunderstood mother, and professional artist with a mysterious past. Our heroine flees with her adorable, young son to a small hamlet, and settles into a musty, remote cottage. The townspeople attempt to extend their welcome, but she is unable or unwilling to reciprocate, preferring her own company and her work. Surprisingly, one of the townsmen seems to find her contradictions fascinating, and her defenses intriguing. He falls in love with her, and she with him. However, confused by her behavior, he makes an unfortunate character assessment of another man whom he considers his rival. At this point, our heroine seems to realize that even though his behavior has become problematical, she cares and sympathizes with him. By way of explanation, she hands him her journal and dares him to read it! As her journal is reenacted, in flashback, the real story begins. The author tantalizingly peels away clues with skill and suspense. For those who enjoy a well-executed mystery and romance, this wonderful version of Anne Bronte's tale won't disappoint.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|In my opion, this movie was all hype. It should have never been placed on a DVD, but left in the comic book world. The Green Lantern was an idiot, and his sidekick made the entire movie.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|Thank goodness for the pause and rewind buttons. I found myself often having to go back during a scene wondering if I saw what I thought I had just seen. SPARTACUS: GODS OF THE ARENA is sure high on the shock level counter. It's a constant festival of bloodletting and sex and don't get started on the language. It is all amazing and shocking..even more so than the original SPARTACUS series.<br />I have to commend STARZ for continuing this popular series despite the illness of the star Andy Whitfield, who recently passed away. Rather than replace Whitfield as SPARTACUS or end the series, the brought it back as a prequel. Rarely do prequels work and it's even more rare to have the same actors portray themselves in the prequel.<br />In GODS OF THE ARENA, we learn how the House of Batiatus began to emerge from a second rate gladiator school to find fame and glory. SPARTACUS ended in a brutal bloodbath and many main characters were murdered off in the series, but all of them are back in GODS OF THE ARENA. We learn more about each gladiator and slave and Roman citizens. There is a new star gladiator called Gannicus played by Dustin Clare. Manu Bennett as the Gaul gladiator Crixus is not recognizable as first with his long hair and savage nature. We learn how Ashur became handicapped. If you are a fan of SPARTACUS: BLOOD AND SAND, it's really exciting to go back in time and see how it all started.<br />There is plenty of sexy and frontal nudity-both male and female. It's a bit unnerving that for a while The House of Batiatus tries to seek the favor of powerful men by having their slaves and gladiators in a sort of Roman brothel. Nothing is sacred here and be prepared to be shocked at every corner.<br />It's great to see Quintus and Lucretia Batiatis back from the dead played again by Lucy Lawless and John Hannah. They seem to relish their roles as the devious and ambitious but childless couple. I enjoyed watching this international cast trying to all speak like ancient Romans. John Hannah's Scottish accent was always evident in mild form. The actors try to form a common language despite their diverse backgrounds.<br />It's important to mention again that the fight scenes are extremely graphic as blood and severed limbs careen across the scream almost in a 3-D effect. Blood spatters in the spectators in the arena. Gladiators die in horrible ways and it is all part of ancient Rome. How accurate is what we are seeing? Certainly, the ancient Romans loved their galdiator spectacles. Did the rich and slaves alike talk  constantly in vulgar and sexually-explicit words?<br />GODS OF THE ARENA is certainly a visual work of art not to be missed by fans of the original series.'s Scottish accent was always evident in mild form.

B004LWZW4C|1.0|Movie is great 5 Stars there, Blue ray discs not working on many players however.  Like many others here I have a PS3 and them among many other blue ray players apparently can't play this disc properly.  There is a work around for the PS3 at least (which is a major PITA) unlike some other players but Fox really needs to own up to this huge mistake and fix it/pay for it.  What sort of pathetic quality control lets a disc release that doesn't work on half the blue ray players out there?  Even SONY players!

Another fantastic thing about this book is its metodology. This book explains the main idea using different kind of pictures, stories and useful information.
B00004W19V|1.0|It claims it have closed captioning, in fact it DOES NOT, and therefore I have to give it a bad review because no captioning, and it's misleading to say it does.
B003XRZZFM|5.0|Great album, and well worth the price I paid for it. I was also very impressed with the condition it arrived in, being that I ordered it new. From order to arrival at my house was very quick also.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game is great for either a quick few minutes in a waiting room or hours of play during boring lectures. Autosave would be nice, but not imperative.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Really fun, definitely addicting. Works just fine on my Nexus S, but it's slow to load. It's missing tons of game modes which, while they wouldn't make the game bigger, would also make it more enjoyable (perhaps release them as SD card add-on content?). Also, the graphics need some work to keep up with higher resolution displays. I'm expecting this to look like garbage when I get the new Nexus, and with tablets getting more widespread, this shouldn't better support those as well. On the note of the new Nexus, this game desperately needs backup/restore capabilities. I don't want to have to play from scratch when I've nearly beaten the game 100%.
B00000K31V|3.0|One reviewer said \\"gooey special effects and psychological drama\\" and that sums up this movie. It tries to make you second guess yourself. What is real? What is in your (the characters) heads? The twists and turns rollercoaster ride is dizzying.  Wanted to see Callum Keith Rennie (who is actually in it very little) and got an hour and half headache. For people willing to suspend reality and take things as they come along.

0316098337|5.0|Finished this book in less than 3 days.  It's one of the best books I've ever read, never a dull moment.  I don't understand how anyone could give it less than 5 stars.  Amazing story and perspective.
0553573411|4.0|As with the first book in the series, this book is very well written and I love the characters.  Finally we get a taste of what is to come with the red ships and the wit.  Again the theme of the story is sacrifice.  Where the first book was nearly stand-alone from beginning to end (save the red ships), this book is clearly relying on the third to tie up all the loose ends.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I loved this single. Granted it's the only single I have gotten but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I loved how great the character development was and found myself rooting for each person.
0451169514|4.0|This book was so much more than I bargained for.  I expected a scary book.  After reading it, I totally see why it was 1000+ pages.  It's not just a horror book.  Don't get me wrong - I actually had nightmares from reading this alone at night.  King's descriptions of suspense and gore are vivid and chilling.  However, this book is also about friendship.  The kinship amongst the seven \\"losers\\" is so precious and remains so into adulthood.  Each character is developed extensively.  So much to the point that I feel like I know them all personally.    The reason for the one star off is I thought the ending was a bit anti-climatic.  Their final encounter with It was not as dramatic as their childhood encounters.  And afterwards, I thought the rest of the story to finish telling Bill's part was a bit overdrawn.  Still, an incredibly well written book.  Highly highly recommend it.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  Colin Firth and the rest of the class is quite enjoyable and the area the mini series was filmed was quite beautiful.

B000002U6E|5.0|I was in a gift shop at Magic Mountain when I first heard Enigma.  I was so taken with the song they were playing that I waited 45 minutes for them to find out the artist's name for me.  I have since purchased everything they have ever recorded.  I hope they continue to record for many years to come.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|Possible Spoilers<br />Sci-Fi movies are a touchy genre, a lot of times they get too bogged down in science jargon and technical terms that most normal people don't use in everyday life. Sci-Fi/Horror films are even touchier, too many rely on violence and no explanation (\\"Event Horizon\\" anyone?) and like that film the idea of being stranded in deep space has been done so many times before, (see The \\"Alien\\" films).<br /><br />\\"Pandorum\\" is set in the way distant future and opens on a ship that has been sent out to find a suitable alternative to Earth, cause our planet is basically dead. One man awakens from deep suspended animation on the ship and at first has no clue who he is or why he's on the ship. He finds his name is Bower (Ben Foster, \\"3:10 to Yuma\\", \\"The Punisher\\") and soon after another man awakens Payton (Dennis Quaid, \\"The Rookie\\", \\"Your's, Mine & Our's\\") and both try to find out why they're on the ship and why the power is running low.<br /><br />The early reels build some suspense and soon Bower realizes they're not alone on the ship. There are a bunch of creatures, that have been hunting and killing any living humans on the ship. Payton sends Bower out to the reactivate the reactor at the center of the ship. The rest of the film has Bower avoiding the creatures and making his way to the reactor. Along the way he meets a couple of other people a woman named Nadia (Antje Traue) and a guy named Manh (Cung Lu, \\"Fighting\\"). Both of them join Bower, Nadia more reluctantly.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of films from this genre, \\"Pandorum\\" actually has plenty of suspense and a few good scares, even if the movie is overall fairly predictable. The acting is well, average for the most part, though Foster and Quaid are pretty good, given the material. One thing to note is Traue is way, way and I mean way hot.<br /><br />Overall a great movie, watch and enjoy. *** out of 4 stars.
B005DZ35RC|4.0|The 2011 Blu-ray includes great special features missing from the dvd releases, most importantly (to me) a Director's Commentary.  There's also an interactive viewing mode called Television Chocolate. A must for Burton fans!
B002NXSRW0|4.0|Director Stephen Sommers has had box office hits, \\"The Mummy\\", \\"The Mummy Returns\\" and even the poorly written \\"Van Hellsing\\". All his films had a certain zing and lots of humor, which sometimes worked like in \\"The Mummy\\" but other times it seemed forced rather than breezy.<br /><br />Now he brings the G.I. Joe franchise to the big screen and despite my early fears turned out to be the perfect blend of action, humor, nostalgia and of course bad acting. The film involves a group of bad guys working for an arms dealer named McCullen (Christopher Eccelston, \\"The Others\\") and Cobra (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, T.V.'s \\"Third Rock From The Sun\\" and \\"500 Days of Summer\\") trying to capture 4 warheads with nano-technology that can destroy any metal objects it comes into contact with.<br /><br />The good guys of course are a covert group named G.I. Joe, lead by General Hawk (Dennis Quiad, \\"The Rookie\\"). He recruits two soldiers Duke (Channing Tatum, \\"Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift\\") and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans, \\"The Scary Movie\\" franchise) who were on a covert mission to deliver the warheads when Cobra soldiers intercepted and captured em.<br /><br />There's a bit of a story here beyond that but not much, McCullen designed the warheads and wants to use them to control the world. There's also a side sotry with Duke and Ana aka The Baroness (Sienna Miller, \\"Casanova\\" and \\"Stardust\\"), they were to be married but certain events caused their relationship to fall apart.<br /><br />There's also a character called Snake Eyes, a fully costumed master swordsman (Ray Park, Darth Maul in \\"The Phantom Menace\\") who has a score to settle with Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee). Other cool characters include Zartan (Arnold Vosloo, \\"The Mummy\\" and \\"The Mummy Returns\\") and Scarlett (Rachel Nichols, \\"The Amityville Horror\\"). Even Jonathan Pryce makes an appearance as the President of the U.S.<br /><br />There are problems like the shear unbelievable stunts, some of the writing goes beyond cheesy and is just bad and honestly Tatum is one of the most wooden actors besides Josh Harnett and Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />The good points are the action and pacing are both well done, the humor is dead on most of the time and for the guys (and statistically some of the girls) Miller and Nichols look beyond fantastic. They did get a lot of the nostalgia of the old cartoon, like the laser effects and sounds and the overall good ol' American come to the rescue aspect. *** out of 4 starsust bad and honestly Tatum is one of the most wooden actors besides Josh Harnett and Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />The good points are the action and pacing are both well done, the humor is dead on most of the time and for the guys (and statistically some of the girls) Miller and Nichols look beyond fantastic.

1439181780|5.0|I read the secret and thought it was good, but this book seemed to really stick with me.  Its soo true in life.  I am living my dream currently, but have found myself drifting into negitive thoughts once the economy went down...just like so many around me.  My husband and I begain the whole because of the economy this...because of the economy that..can't afford this...can't afford that....and it doesn't feel good. I told my husband I refuse to feel bad anymore about the economy and money.  This book came out just in time to lift my spirits and help me to remember how I got where I am today in the 1st place and to continue being my happy positive self...and to keep on dreaming.  I read this book over and over again..and it makes me feel soo good!  It is really inpsiring and just a beautiful book.  I highly recomment it to all!!  ENJOY!!!
B001GCUO4S|1.0|\\"Final Destination\\" was a fun, creepy and unique horror film. The cast was good, including Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Seann William Scott and Tony Todd. The second movie also had Larter, Todd and not much else and the thrid film had more of a no name cast. All three films involved death coming after the survivors of a certain terrible accident that occured in the beginning of the film.<br /><br />\\"The Final Destination\\" has a virtually no name cast and it all starts with a Nascar like event, where a terrible crash happens in a vision by Nick O'Bannon (Bobby Campo), so he alerts everyone he can about the crash and his girlfriend, a few friends and a couple of random cahracters manage to escape.<br /><br />Of course the typical formula follows, death starts coming after everyone in the order they were supposed to die in the crash. The deaths are sadly not very cool, at least not compared to the others, some are just laugh out loud fake looking.<br /><br />The acting is very, and I mean very subpar even for a horror film, again the cast isn't very noteworthy, on the plus side there are some attractive girls in the cast, especially Shantel VanSanten. The pacing isn't very good, there is some good humor, even a few laugh out loud moments, mostly at the death scenes. It's really not worth watching unless you have some friends and want to blast it with your own commentary. * out of 4 stars.
0385534639|5.0|OH MY!  Thank you very much, Erin.  The world is full of magic, isn't it?    Having never written a book review before, I hope this short one impresses on all who read it what a wonderful book this is.

B003ZSJ212|3.0|Who cares what people say about how bad this format is.   If you love Star War and a die hard fan this is a must have and also to support George to make other one with 3D and fixed the some CGI.  I own all the formats of Star Wars VHS, VCD, LD, DVD and now the Blu-ray set which is great with very detailed picture quality which looks 100+ time sharper. I love the extras too.  The audio is much better with my new 7.1 amp.  I was sick of the DVD quality on my big HD screen.  With the HD CGI rendering, there were some bad scene with the CG + live footage which did not match that well, apart from that over all I am very happy with this Blu-ray set.  I did not give a 5 star because this format dose not have 3D and audio is not 7.1.  I cant wait for the UltraHD format when it comes out or if it comes out.

0440242401|4.0|I loved the Shopoholic series and have fallen in love with her novel books. First it makes me want to go to London. Second, it makes me want to have a coma. Okay, maybe not a coma, but it was a great story. I don't condone cheating, but I'm glad the girl woke up in time to fix her life.
B005F96URI|4.0|Just your basic noir, German Expressionist, samurai comicbook-come-to-life kind of movie - but absolutely incredible. If there ever was a wall between live action and animated movies, it's gone now. Clever animated interludes separate each big sequence from the next, but the artwork stays on in the skies and backgrounds of the live action. Even the supposedly photographic sequences have been color-shifted and manipulated into brilliant hues and moody darks - eye-popping chromatics keep the viewer visually entertained to the end. Then, there are visual references to more classic films than I can hope to name, including an apparent reference to Dr. Strangelove on one motorcycle's license plate. But, if you're looking for action, wonderfully choreographed comedic fight scenes approach Jackie Chan's best.<br /><br />Plot? Motivation? Characterization? Well, not so much, but let's not dwell on that. The visual spectacle makes this worthwhile.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
044024238X|4.0|Loved the story and again like any S. Kinsella novel, I want to go to England! It was funny how as a lawyer and not knowing any maid duties, the girl got away with so much lying and help. Really entertaining~
B0052U59F4|5.0|If ever there was a book that was \\"perfect\\", Fifty Shades of Grey is the one. In all my years reading, I have never seen characters \\"come alive\\" as they do in this book. The author wraps this amazing love story around your heart and makes you hope it never ends. I have read the sequel the wrapping just continues on.......
0440241901|4.0|I love Sophie's series Shopoholic and have falled for her individual novel. Can You Keep A Secret was really entertaining and almost made me go crazy at the main character.
B005COO1X6|1.0|With a few minor exceptions, I love most everything Stephen King has ever published. I was super excited to see this story, which I thought would be just right for a pre-bedtime reading session. Unfortunately, by the time I got to the end, I was so disappointed that I had a hard time falling asleep. I thought the writing was clunky, the plot disjointed and repetitive, the characters unbelievable, and the conclusion completely unsatisfying.   This is only only SK work I genuinely regret spending money on. I'd recommend people spend the extra few bucks and get one of his previous collections, like Night Shift (The Mangler, The Ledge, The Last Rung on the Ladder), Skeleton Crew (The Mist, Word Processor of the Gods, The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet), Everything's Eventual (The Man in the Black Suit, 1408, Riding the Bullet), or Just After Sunset (The Gingerbread Girl, Rest Stop, Stationary Bike).
0385342039|4.0|I literally laughed out loud at a few parts. Really entertaining and the story was filled with romance, mystery, and vintage wear.
B005NK69ZC|3.0|I love Ellen - so much so that I never miss her show. I record it when I have to go out. I say this to explain how I know and am so disappointed by the fact I am only partway through her new book and am recognising tracts of it from her show. The stand-up routine she does at the beginning of each show has been included in chunks. Sometimes I don't think she's changed a word - such as Portia and her lotion addiction resulting in her being trapped in the bathroom unable to turn the doorknob to escape. I laughed and laughed when I first saw Ellen say that. Not so much reading it almost word for word. I also laughed the first time I saw her displaying Mama Betty's odd collection of hoarded junk including a VHS tape of Abs of Steel. Funny then. I could go on, but I am guessing this answers the question Ellen asks at the start of the book: how she found the time to write it. Maybe I'll just call her a good recycler. I still love her - that's why I gave this a fairly generous three stars. But I am sad the book isn't fresher and more biographical and a little less, ahem, retreaded. For people who don't religiously watch her show, they will find this funny, especially if they liked My Point Is And I Do Have One, as it is written in that style.
0312323867|4.0|After the whole story with Rachael and Dex, I wasn't a big fan of Darcy or Dex. This book definitely makes you like Darcy. I'm glad it was a happy ending. I couldn't put it down. I loved the whole series and just finished \\"heart of the matter\\" today.
1577314808|1.0|It's a bad sign when in the introduction you learn that the author wandered about in a blissful, homeless daze for quite some time after discovering the secrets he's about to impart to you.<br /><br />Furthermore, I have yet to understand what it is he's peddling exactly.  There's a lot of new age doublespeak, followed by unrealistic suggestions such as always living in the moment.  Should I not plan for retirement or consider what all this fast food will do to me eventually?  But he doesn't explain in a clear manner how these philosophies can be applied to a person's life.<br /><br />There are some good, solid questions posed by \\"the audience\\" in this book.  \\"How do I also convince my boss that time doesn't exist so I'm not 'late' to work all the time?\\"  But Tolle sidesteps these questions with more questions, like a politician diverting our attention.  I'm still in the dark, and I don't think I care to dig any deeper.  I'll stick with someone who spells out his philosophy clearly and in a useful way, like Tony Robbins.<br /><br />My final verdict is that Tolle just wants you to feel good about yourself while you're reading the book, and hopes you'll mistakenly think you're doing it wrong if you can't put his ideas into practice once you're finished.  That is probably the true \\"Power of Now.\\"
B003L77TZI|4.0|I wasn't really sure how to rate this album because it really feels like two different albums in one.  Half of the tracks I can't stand, and the other half I love and play on repeat.  Here's my breakdown:<br /><br />1. \\"Teenage Dream\\" - 7/10<br />It's a hit for a reason - it's very catchy but misses the mark with me for value.<br /><br />2. \\"Last Friday Night\\" - 7/10<br />For a long time, I wasn't fond of the message in this one, so it put me off, but the fun tone of it is kind of infectious!  It's a good song to listen to when you want to forget your problems and just have a good time.  If I have to be honest, it sounds like Katy singing about what Ke$ha lives every day. ;)<br /><br />3. \\"California Gurls\\" - 7/10<br />Catchy but no real value to me.<br /><br />4. \\"Firework\\" - 10/10<br />Great song.  This is probably what made me buy the album!  Not only is this tune unforgettable in sound, but the lyrics are inspirational, about realizing there is something amazing in you even when you are down for the count.<br /><br />5. \\"Peacock\\" - 1/10<br />SKIP - about a man's manhood.... ugh.  I listened to this CD for the first time in my car while driving to work, and I couldn't mash the buttons on my dash fast enough to skip this.  I tried giving it a few tries at home, but these lyrics are just disappointing.<br /><br />6. \\"Circle the Drain\\" - 10/10<br />Here was another of my favorites.  This one, while being catchy like most of Perry's album, deals with drug addiction, but from the point of view of a partner who doesn't want to see her S.O. go down deeper and deeper.  This message is a tough sell - \\"I'm leaving because I don't want to deal with your addiction\\" - when most people want to hear a message of help and support, but this is a song about looking out for your own best interests, more like \\"Who am I living for?\\" (#9).<br /><br />7. \\"The One That Got Away\\" - 10/10<br />Very touching song.  Most of us, I think, have been there, and it's hard not to like this one.<br /><br />8. \\"E.T.\\" - 10/10<br />This track is so cleverly written and composed, it's hard not to take to it.  The metaphor is unique (<br />kind of reminds me of Britney Spears' \\"Toxic\\" though) and this album version doesn't feel nearly as cheap and campy as the remix with the ridiculous rap lyrics.<br /><br />9. \\"Who Am I Living For?\\" - 10/10<br />\\"I can see the writing on the wall/I can't ignore this war/At the end of it all/Who am I living for?\\"  This song can be taken a lot of ways - I see it as an antiwar song from the point of view of a soldier, but I also interpret it as the anthem for anyone fighting for what they believe in but being faced with other people's overbearing views.  To me, it says, \\"You want me to do it your way, but this is my life, and I have to do what I believe in.\\"  I group this with \\"Firework\\" and \\"Circle the Drain\\" for sure.<br /><br />10. \\"Pearl\\" - 10/10<br />A great song with a strong message.  If you know a woman who was fierce and strong before her current relationship, but her current partner dims her or subjects her, then this song will make you tear up.  I *love* this song!<br /><br />11. \\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" - 5/10<br />I'm no prude, but I found this song embarrassing.  It sounds catchy, but listen to the lyrics and just think about it.  I didn't like the metaphor, and I could hardly listen to it.  I would group this with \\"Peacock.\\"<br /><br />12. \\"Not Like the Movies\\" - 9/10<br />A good song about not settling and holding out for \\"the one\\" and not simply \\"the one who wants you.\\"<br /><br />13. \\"California Gurls\\" Remix<br />I didn't care for the original, so no real comment about this one.<br /><br />14. \\"Teenage Dream\\" Remix<br />See #13.<br /><br />So, overall, it was hard to rate this album given that it's half juvenile, snickering, \\"I-made-a-sex-reference\\" tracks or superficial, meaningless lyrics, while the other half has strong messages I treasured.  I think most of Perry's fans will be buying this for the radio hits that didn't resonate with me, but don't ignore the quite a few gems in here: \\"Firework,\\" \\"Circle the Drain,\\" \\"The One That Got Away,\\" \\"E.T.,\\" \\"Pearl,\\" \\"Not Like the Movies,\\" and \\"Who Am I Living For?\\"<br /><br />Hope this review helps.at didn't resonate with me, but don't ignore the quite a few gems in here: \\"Firework,\\" \\"Circle the Drain,\\" \\"The One That Got Away,\\" \\"E.T.,\\" \\"Pearl,\\" \\"Not Like the Movies,\\" and \\"Who Am I Living For?\\"<br /><br />Hope this review helps.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|Liked the idea of the beginning and the ending following the same script! Of course, felt bad for the Elk! I thought the middle section wasn't slow, instead it gave it some personality! Great Movie, great PQ. Alternate ending left one wondering where that was leading to?
B005DC68NI|4.0|This is an interesting read for anyone looking for more information on the publishing world. It is general and no too deep for the casual researcher. The author gives good references to use to self publish your work and doesn't forget to include links for more information. I usually find it difficult to make it through \\"guide\\" books, but the author's writing style was entertaining enough to keep me interested. I will be keeping this for when I finally manage to write my \\"great American novel\\" or at least a fairly good bit of fiction.
0756405890|5.0|Name of the wind, what should I say? What can I say? The name tells it all, at least for people who have read the book. If you haven't read it, why not? It's a very well written book with something I can't put words to but I enjoy it never the less. Is it the greatest work of fantasy? No, but it's up there. If you love fantasy do yourself a favor and pick this one up, you'll not want to put it down till your done.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I was so looking forward to this book and it did not disappoint.  I dont want to go into details since I hate spoilers. I love Jack Reacher so much I am always so sad when my love affair with him is over.<br /><br />I was truly disappointed in the news that Tom Cruise is being cast as Jack Reacher and do not plan ever to watch the movies,  I picture Jack more like the guy on the CBS series Person of Interest Jim Caviezel.
0756404738|5.0|In many ways this book surpasses Name of the Wind. Yet in other ways it falls short of Name of the Wind. I have felt both books have been to short yet together they are over 1600 pages. Why is it? Because what Patrick Rothfuss has done can be called nothing but Art. When you pick up the book you think, \\"well how long will this take?\\" Then on your last page you think, \\"but I just started.\\" If you haven't read Name of the Wind, go read it. It's worth your time.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|Very nice.  However, it does not keep time if not worn daily.  I did not realize that characteristic of an automatic watch.
0547391005|5.0|This book has all the best Curious George stories conveniently in one nice hardcover book.  The book is large and has all the original art work, so yes there is smoking in there, but they should never mess with classics to begin with.  As a bonus there is an audio CD included with 4 stories on it great for a road trip.

1595828095|4.0|For the first time ever we get all of Berni Wrightson's work for Warren in one book. And the work he did for Warren was the best he ever did, so this book is a must buy.

Poe's \\"The Black Cat\\" (another Poe adaption was to be \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", which Wrightson never got to finish), and H. P. Lovecraft's \\"Cool Air\\", both being perhaps the best graphic adaptions of those two stories ever. Also included, of course, are such Wrightson classics as \\"Jenifer\\", which was adapted by Dario Argento (himself a fan of Wrightson) for the Masters of Horror TV series, and what many consider Bernie's best work ever, \\"The Muck Monster\\" (though we get the Warren \\"colorized\\" version here; this story looks much better in b&w; see the book \\"A look back\\" for a comparison), which is nothing but a prelude to his work on Frankenstein. We also get every other piece of artwork he did for both Creepy and Eerie, be it drawings for the frontispiece and/or covers. The printing is crisp and detailed and it's all bound in hardback, so what is there not to like?  However, I don't see the real purpose of this book. For those buying the Creepy and Eerie archives, we will see all this in future volumes... I really don't understand why this book even exists, unless it's something Dark Horse aims to do; sell us books by different artists that collaborated with Warren. If so, it'd be great to see future books on Corben (the version done by Heavy Metal some years back came out blurry and seemed to be out of focus; plus it didn't include all of Corben's work for Warren), John Severin, Russ Heath, Wally Wood, etc. Other than that, this book offers no input whatsoever by Wrightson himself, which is a shame, as it would be interesting to know something more about these stories. It would have also been an added bonus if the work here had been scanned from the original artwork as opposed to the printed version from the magazine. I would have loved to have seen Wrightson's \\"Four Classic Martians\\" in it's original color version; even though it was supposed to be published in black and white, Wrightson had done it in color (the original artwork was three feet tall, and though parts of it were used for a cover as well, they were recolored by someone else). I also have my doubts of Wrightson ever inking the Dick Swift story. The inking looks like it was done by Walt Simonson or even Klaus Janson, but certainly not Wrightson (compare the inking on this story with that on the previous story \\"Country Pie\\", and you'll see what I mean). Maybe this was a rare occasion where Wrightson pencilled the story and Carmine Infantino inked it, though I also have my doubts, as the drawings look very Infantino-like, and Infantino was pencilling rather than inking for Warren at the time. Whatever the case, it would have been interesting to know what happened here... Was it a blunder on the part of the Warren staff (they usually did blunders like this), or was Wrightson trying to ink like Carmine Infantino? Another question arises with the Reuben Youngblood story which seems to have been partially pencilled by Wrightson, and then finished off by Howie Chaykin (actually only the first three pages seem to have been drawn by Wrightson, the rest seems to have been done by Chaykin himself). Alas, only Wrightson himself can tell us if such is the case, and since he's apparently not involved with this book whatsoever, we will never know the real answer.  In conclusion; if you're not buying the Creepy and Eerie archives and are a fan of Wrightson, you should buy this book. Even if you've only heard about him and wonder what all the fuss is about, you should get your hands on this book and check for yourself why Wrightson has been one of the top artists in the comic book business. However, if you're buying the different Warren archives, I don't see why you should buy this book, as you'll be getting the exact same stories in future volumes.  It's all up to you, folks...
0470901071|5.0|Thanks, Passed ICND1, 937!  Todd does a great job with a very conversational style and nice real world examples.  I used his book in combination with elementK Video training for ICND1.  Todd recommends for CCENT ICND1, studying CH 1-8, 10, 12, 14, 16.  I found the elementK training to be great due to its format of video but lacking with details.  Todd's book in contrast really has great detail and was instrumental for my studies.  Make sure you don't merely read the book.  Take the time to take notes to summarize details while also using the summary questions at the end of each chapter.  Now on to ICND2...  One hint for your exam is make sure you know multiple ways of accomplishing tasks and finding information.  MCSE + Security, A+, Security+  Cisco CSE, Cisco CCENT
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This boy is going places. I loved watching him on American Idol and enjoyed his easy way with the audience and fellow contestants. This album puts Scotty's talent to work with songs that were well written for his style and range. Very enjoyable music...and I'm not a big Country fan either.
B004P8JPS6|2.0|I almost cried when the book ended.  Lee Childs has always said that Reacher saw what was coming and left the Army.  He did leave, but the way he left was like a kick in the fanny.  Like he said,  I have a purple heart.  I am assuming it was a honorable seperation, as all the rest of the books say so, but it was sad the way he went. Another impression I had and it does say it on LeeChilds website, that he is blonde, and has artic ice blue eyes.  It is never mentioned in this book.  I liked to read how he looks in each book. I do love him.  I hope there will be a next one tho', I will buy it.  I will probably read the reviews first instead of pre ordering.  Becky Schnaufer
0802473156|5.0|This purchase was exactly what I ordered. It arrived quickly and in great condition. If you have read the book; then you are in for an amazing discovery. It is AMAZING!
B004UID2LC|5.0|Finally an app that let's you save a video if you like to watch it over and over and do not have to use your data plan... I love this app...
B001O3B2M2|5.0|I absolutely love this album. From start to finish, it is truly a masterpiece. Christina Aguilera has an amazing voice, several songs on Stripped showcases her talent.
B000FC1AGG|1.0|I read Undomestic Goddess and loved it so much that I decided to purchase Can You Keep a Secret afterwards. I was highly disappointed in this book for so many reasons.  The characters are not fully developed and it doesn't feel like the reader gets to know them they way you do in other Kinsella novels (like Becky in Shopaholic or Samantha in U.Goddess). The story unfolds rather quickly in the beginning of the book, and the rest of it is just boring to get through. I'm still a huge Sophie Kinsella fan and will continue to read her books though.
0553801473|2.0|I stopped reading Robert Jordan after the sixth book, and I really don't want to do the same with this series.  I'm still planning on reading the next books (how many will there be, George?) but Martin is falling into the Jordan-esque trap of writing longer and longer books in which less and less happens.<br /><br />Despite huge armies amassing, this book contains no battles.  A few plans are thwarted, no goals are truly accomplished, and we don't get detectably closer to the anticipated big showdowns (Dany's dragons returning to conquer Westeros and the fight with the Others at the Wall).  There are lots of feasts and descriptions of food.  Lots of grisly death.  Lots of petty posturing, sellswords changing sides, Tyrion bumbling and plotting and playing cyvasse.<br /><br />Bran finally reaches his three-eyed crow and learns to see the world through the network of weirwoods with faces, but just when that gets interesting, about halfway through the book, there are no more Bran chapters.  We don't learn anything more about the mysteries of the Wall, the Others, or the Red God and his priests' ability to see the future.<br /><br />Cersei is shamed but accomplishes nothing important.  Jaime travels a few miles.  Arya has some entertaining adventures that fail to reinsert her into any of the major plotlines.  Nothing interesting happens in Dorne.  The events in the epilogue are not at all unexpected and fail to inspire me to pick up the next book.<br /><br />Martin is often compared to Tolkien, and indeed they are both talented writers who have created epic stories set in large, diverse, and believable worlds.  However, I enjoyed Tolkien much more, and here's why.<br /><br />1.  Tolkien offers a grand historical perspective and a believable basis for the magic in his books.  Martin provides empty history and (so far at least) fails to explain any of the magic or mysteries in his books.<br /><br />2.  Tolkien provides a clear distinction between good and evil, to the point that some consider it a fault.  Martin's world has more shades of gray.  That could be a good thing, but he needs to stop killing all of the honorable characters and letting all the bad ones live.<br /><br />3.  Tolkien sets a clear final goal (destroying the ring) and continues to progress toward that goal throughout the three books while telling interesting and entertaining stories along the way.  He splits plotlines and rejoins them, returning to just two by the end.  With Martin's books, progress toward the final battles has stagnated to the point where there is no detectable forward motion, and we are at five books already.<br /><br />George is a great writer with a knack for keeping the reader engaged with humor, unpredictable turns of events, and cliffhanger chapter endings.  However, in the interest of keeping the story going and eventually reaching a conclusion, he needs to move things along, draw plotlines back together, and refrain from introducing new plotlines for a while.  It may be that he has these things planned out already, but if the pace doesn't accelerate a bit in the next book he may well lose me as a reader.
B000QJM8Z0|5.0|Admittedly, I watched the movie before reading the book, so I was a bit hesitant to purchase this and sit down to read it, but I am so happy I did.  The book captures the true essence of Bridget, and I feel like I got to know her and the characters a lot more than in the movie. I laughed out loud a few times, which is rare for me while reading books!   Even if you've seen the movie, it's still a great read.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For the price, and in this size you don't have a lot of options. There might be a lot better products to get that samurai sharp edge, but for the rest of us, this will do the trick!
0670022411|2.0|This book had potential the be very good. The first few chapters are capturing, very intelligent and sets up what appears to be a very good plot line. In the beginning the author is very detailed and ties the story in with science and history. After that, the story falls flat and goes nowhere for about half the book. Towards the end it starts to get interesting again but then the story ends! It doesn't tie up a lot of the parts that were intriguing.  The author introduces many characters that just disappear.  The center conflict seems to only reside in the main characters heads. There are also many parts that are written in french and not explained, it was very frustrating to read. In the end I felt cheated and left confused. I do not recommend this book. A waste of time.
B005LAZIRY|5.0|These are all words that could be used to describe this album, but the problem with this is they are also words that could be used to describe most of the Opeth back catalog. Therefore we need to look at the treasures in this recording that sets it apart from earlier offerings from the band.<br /><br />The first, and most notable, change is the lack of growls. I would attribute this to a growing confidence that Mike has in his own ability to sing, rather than to a dramatic shift in musical styles as other people have suggested. As the years have gone by there has been a gradual shift in the ratio between growling and singing (Even though Watershed had the HEAVIEST Opeth song ever on it, it still had the largest amount of pure singing that the band had offered until that point)<br /><br />As is a characteristic of Opeth's music (and most prog metal in general) this is not an album you instantly fall in love with. However, a few listens will start to unveil the treasures I referred to above. It is these that make the album remarkable for me. A huge chunk of the credit there has to go to the production work Steve Wilson has performed on the album. Each instrument, each note, each moment seems to be given the perfect space for you to explore it in.<br /><br />In conclusion, my verdict on the album has 2 parts:<br />1. Does it eclipse the brilliance of Blackwater Park? Not quite, that is the band's finest album, and I think it will be a long time before they are able to match that!<br />2. Does Heritage point to a promising near future for the band? YES! If the progression they have shown from Watershed (the title of that album becoming more relevant to me by the second!) continues on, I cannot wait to hear what is next!<br />For now though, I will go back to the beginning of Heritage and continue to enjoy a really brilliant prog album.<br />I challenge you to do the same!
B0055SWM08|4.0|very dissatisfied with how often my phone freezes in the middle of my games but i do enjoy challenging puzzles if it lets me not force close the app.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|[HTC Thunderbolt] - It is a puzzle type game.  You are challenged to figure out a way to keep the spider away from the bugs and are allowed to try and try again until you figure it out before you move onto the next variation.  I found it quite entertaining.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|looks like a decent app. I'm not big on the free hand writing part, but the keyboard works well. I just don't like how every word starts with a cap. Letter, but for free I can't complain too much.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My 6yr old played with it for an hour straight (he generally does not want to play anything other than angry birds rio otherwise, so I was impressed).  A good combination of simple to understand concepts yet still challenging.  I prefer these types of games for my kids because while they are blowing off steam from all their homework, at least they are learning to predict what will happen in terms of simple physics when you cut the rope of a swinging mass and not being trained to like killing.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this chapter in the ongoing saga of our favorite spacey-wacey, wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey traveler.  Oh, make sure to also buy the 2010 Christmas special titled 'A Christmas Carol'.  I feel it was definitely worth the extra $15 ($12 + $3 shipping).  Knock-knock.... Who's there?.... EXACTLY!
0823015033|5.0|un libro exelente tanto para los que quieren aprender a modelar figuras, como para los que necesitan un libro de referencia a la hora de ponerse a trabajar. lo recomiendo.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I was completely blown away by this movie. It is one of the best looking animated movies I have seen and is an exciting, emotional and clever piece of art. The plot is a bit silly sometimes, but if you can get past that, and love animated films, this movie is one to keep in your collection.
B001B93H0O|2.0|The beginning DVD just shows some \\"standard\\" moves, but then doesn't go into a beginning workout using those moves.  After showing the moves and repeating each a few times, the DVD is over.  Does that make you ready for the advanced DVD?  NO.  Not even if you watch the beginning DVD a few times before moving on, which I did.  It's a huge leap from one to the next.  The advanced is much faster and seems to throw in several more steps that weren't introduced in the beginning DVD.  Also, although you can see what they're doing on the screen, waiting for the English translation about 30 seconds after it's said in Spanish gets annoying, especially in the buns and thighs DVD.  I haven't even tried the power DVD yet because it's probably even harder than the advanced.  Overall, I'm so disappointed in this purchase.  I expected to use it a lot, but it's just sitting on the shelf because, in my opinion, it's not very user-friendly.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I tried the \\"Power\\" DVD in the set, and it's actually the only one I use now.  It has several segments, each to a different song and with a different routine.  Some of them are pretty fun to do and vary in difficulty level.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|At times, Never Let Me Go falls victim to its own subtly, but for the most part, it is a touching, emotional story about identity and what makes us human. Great acting, and some amazing cinematography and art direction. You won't forget it.
0439023513|1.0|And I loved the first book.  If someone wanted to read this series I would tell them to stop after The Hunger Games.  The second book is a slow decline that serves only to lead us to the cliff that is the third book.
0385534639|2.0|This was a relatively quick read, I actually read it in one sitting.  And while that usually indicates a great page turner, I felt largely disappointed when I was finished.  \\"The Night Circus\\" is a lackluster story within a beautifully described setting.  I enjoyed the descriptions of the circus, and the author did a great job of really bringing the circus to life.  However, other than the setting, there isn't a whole lot of substance to this book.  While the concept of the story holds promise - two magicians with very different approaches, bind their pupils in a competition to see who is more powerful - it's poorly executed.  Characters are flat, and by the middle of the novel there isn't really any conflict.  So other than the interesting setting, nothing much was going on.  There is a romantic element, however, perhaps due to poor character development, I never felt invested in it.  I just didn't care what happened to anyone in the novel.  Overall, it just didn't do it for me.
B003UESJH4|3.0|A story of a recent British monarch's predecessor-a father of the Queen Elizabeth II, is emphasized on him overcoming speaking difficulties with help of a wife and an Australian actor-turned-the-best-British-Empire-\\"in-speaking-difficulties\\"-professional-speech-pathologist having turned the world history upside down as understood.<br /><br />Everyone I know (me inclusively) like this next work of a reigning family, adding mostly the positive feeling toward commoners screened on a landscape of sky-ness.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a fun, interesting puzzle game.  Reminds me a lot of Zelda games where you would push blocks on ice to access new areas or get items.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|One of the most addictive, fustrating, fun, hair-pulling, time consuming, super, delicious, games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Two thumbs up!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is one of the best series on television.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching every episode and have already pre-ordered the second season.  February can't come soon enough for me.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|By only seeing the coming attractions I knew I wanted the movie, The Losers. Its sort of an A-Team type show, but with more of a punch. The charaters are great, though if you haven't seen it there is one surprise I hadn't counted on. I'm not telling either. Buy it and see.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The new update killed my game, nothing but a black screen. Emailed Amazon, and they said to update the App Store, but that didn't work.
0062515675|3.0|OK, I admit, its a great story, and the concepts - peace, self-improvement, balance - in the form Mr. Sharma has chosen to present them, are important. This book could change your life for the better.   BUT this guy is, really, the Worst Writer in the World. I found myself laughing out loud several times in the first 20 pages - and nothing there was meant to be funny. If you are in to great writing, please, read McMurtry, Irving, almost anyone else. You will barely be able to skim this book, because the writing is quite literally so bad it interferes with the ride.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was amazing! From start to finish it just keeps you drawn into the story, Travis is your typical bad boy. The fighter, the womanizer, the love 'em and leave 'em guy. But all that changes the day he meets Abbey.They make a bet and changes both of their lives. Neither one wants to admit it, but they're crazy about each other. This book is a real page turner. I didn't want to put it down. So much excitement and drama and passion all jammed packed into this book. I would highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a good read.
0385534639|5.0|After rapaciously devouring the first 300 pages, I came to the sad realization that my trip to Le Cirque des Reves was going to end...and soon. I forced myself to slow down in order to properly savor the final fantastic moments. It is so refreshing to experience a book, not just read it. Each tent is more beautiful than the last, each character more intriguing than the one before. The Night Circus is the type of book that transports you away from everyday monotony - and let's be honest, that is something everyone needs these days.   Erin Morgenstern has painted a picture so vivid, so delightfully imagined, so truly entertaining that I will be recommending her beautiful book to everyone I pass.
B004GYY714|5.0|I live in an area where even local radio reception is sketchy.  This allows me to not miss my favorite syndicated and local radio personalities at home or on the go.  And the alarm is great better than the old clock radio I used for years.

B002N5N5R0|5.0|Ok dvd/blu-ray collectors I'll make this short, sweet, and neat:<br /><br />If you are seeking a new series to add to your idea of THE BEST movie/tv series collection - Sons of Anarchy is it. I'm not trying to sell you anything as I don't get diddly squat - I'm just telling you that if you haven't got into this series yet - DO IT!<br /><br />This show is not just about a bad ass biker gang - it's an epic machiavellian saga w/ shakesperean type characters wrapped in a modern day setting.<br /><br />The special features are a great insight into the directors head - so don't think your getting duped on the extra stuff!<br /><br />Get it - get the series - you won't regret the purchase!
B004EPYZXK|5.0|Great movie, great experince. Most reviewers have no basis for judgement since they probably all loved those brainless \\"friends with benefits\\" type of movies. Ill tell you this tho, pay attention and the story will draw you in, I guarantee you WILL feel the desolation and desperation felt by the characters.
0789318245|5.0|Great book for learning about some basic tattoo history, traditional flash art, and tattoo artists. Almost every page has a picture on it and there are good descriptions on American and British tattoo artists. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in tattoo art.

0385534639|1.0|I think I liked this story better when it was called Something Wicked This Way Comes. Good grief. There really is no new story left in the world.
0439023521|5.0|I'd have easily read this all in one sitting if I had the time.  It maintains a good pace throughout.  It's not entirely predictable.  If you get into the first few chapters and decide you like it, you might consider ordering the next book right away.  This one finishes the immediate storyline but it leads right into the second book in the series.
B003L45JLW|5.0|This is a joke. A DVD can handle 48khz/24bits!<br />This is a Bluray disc and we want the highest quality possible. Multichannel and stereo LPCM at 96khz/24bits will be perfect. LPCM at 192khz/24bits will be outstanding.<br />I'm very sad to say, but, I cannot buy this title in this format. Hopefully, soon, it will be reissued in true Bluray-Audio quality.
0307586901|3.0|This book has 225 handmade projects for all holidays all year round.  A few of the projects and ideas are quilled greeting cards, glitter balloons, table setting ideas, harvest centerpieces, etc. Some of the projects are really nice and the ideas are good to have to.    The instructions seem alright to me, but not everyone may agree .  You can find a few of these projects on her website.  One thing you should know before you buy the book is that you have to get the patterns off her website.  You are only given thumbnails of each clipart or template in the book. So if you don't have internet access, what will you do?  Copy of book was from Publisher.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I like this unit very much, easy to use and works great. The only thing that would make it better would be to increase the volume level. It has 6 levels and it is not quite as loud as a the audio on a normal radio station. But like it is, I just have to increase the audio volume on the radio a bit more.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|I didn't see it in theatres - just when it came out on blu-ray.  The story is about what you would expect of a Transformers movie and of course lots of CGI.  The main complaint I have is the girl that replaced Megan Fox.  I'm not a fan of Megan Fox, but this new girl was just awful as an actor and the character was equally as bad.  At least with Megan Fox's character and acting you could believe that she would thrive in those perilous situations (and without running around in super high heels and always bright white clothes the whole time.)  Other than that one complaint, I would say the rest of it was on par with what you would expect from this type of summer blockbuster!
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|No? Me neither.<br /><br />I ask the question, because more often than not, blockbusters, or cheesy b movie or fun concepts seem to be falling under that trap nowadays that I assume was set by the otherwise stellar film Inception, where they tried to be too deep and took themselves seriously.<br /><br />Alright, I'll admit, I'm somewhat lying by answering \\"no\\" to the question. We did have the 90s, where film's weren't overly pretentious, where they knew what they weren't anything deep, and just went with it and was fun as a result. The Mummy was one I can name. And now, the first movie in a while to just focus kn being entertaining has come out: Real Steel.I was lucky to catch the film at an advance screening tonight, and even despite being a free screening, I felt like I put my money to good use.<br /><br />The film takes place in 2027 and centers around Charlie Kenton, a burnt out boxer who owes over thousands of dollars in unpaid lost robot fights- robot fights having replaced human boxing. After a fiasco that is the result of losing A match against a bull, he discovers an ex girlfriend who had his son has died, and his rather bratty son is being taken not custody by adoptive parents. The parents are given $100 ,000 for custody and Charlie looks after his bratty son, Max, while the adoptive parents are in Italy.<br /><br />After he loses yet ANOTHER fight, which is surprising considering this robot, Noisyboy, is a world renowned robot, he and Max take to the wrecked robot yard to find pieces to create a new robot, when a fall down a cliff results in finding Atom, a G20 sparring bot. They take the bot home and, despite being a sparring bot, Max believes Atom has true potential. After winning a match at a zoo, they realize Atom's true potential, and climb their way up the ladder, in a series of fights leading to the ultimate fight- a fight against a champion robot named Zeus.<br /><br />Real Steel is pure, unadulterated fun. Not once did I feel bored, or beaten over the head with pretentious \\"symbolism\\". I went in with no expectations but just a fun rock em sock em robot movie, and came out feeling good about myself and impressed.<br /><br />The reason I enjoyed this so much is for the fact that It knew it wasn't anything deep. I mean, when you have a movie about fighting robots, you want just that, and it gives you that. This wasn't like Transformers 2 or 3 (though 3 was enjoyable) where they took themselves too seriously, and focused more on humans running around trying to figure out supposed conspiracies than the robot fighting. Sure this has some family drama, which is essential to the plot, so no worries there... But even there, the film doesn't take itself too seriously.<br /><br />The film is a tad predictable, which does kind of detract (but only slightly), as you know how the fights are going to end. That said, the predictability does not prevent the fights from being fun and suspenseful. On the topic of the fights themselves, they are ridiculously well done and shot. Apparently they were done with real boxers wearing motion capture suits, and it shows, the fighting is realistic, fluid and human like. The Twin City fight was probably my favourite in the movie! And the final fight is intense, sure to have many on the edge oft heir seats.<br /><br />In short, Real Steel is proof that movies are able to be enjoyable despite being not overly deep, and furthermore are more enjoyable for not trying to be too deep. It's fun, it's funny, it's heartfelt, and is sure to be a real hit this year, as well as I can see a well deserved cult following in this film's future! Don't miss out on it.<br /><br />OVERALL: 9/10<br /><br />PROS: Real Steel is safe, clean fun with lots of exciting robot action, laughs, thrills and heart and doesn't take itself too seriously or try to be too deep. Oh, and you will wish robot boxing existed, so you can buy tickets every weekend!<br /><br />CONS: Predictability, you can tell how it will end frompretty early on.
B0055Q5F36|3.0|The case itself is very awesome.  It hugs the phone wonderfully and the ports are all very protected.  The camera is in no way impeded and the speaker is wide open to allow sound to pass unmuffled.  The silicon is very soft and, if it's like the other cases I've bought from OtterBox, should last for years.  The only part of the design I question is that the hard shell is in the middle portion of the phone and not along the corners.  It seems to me that if I drop the phone that the corners are the most vulnerable and most likely to cause the screen to shatter.  If you want to truly protect the entire phone, you will want to buy a screen guard from another source  The screen protector that comes with this case is HORRIBLE.  First, it has a hole in the middle at the bottom for no apparent reason (I think it may be made for another phone but was \\"close enough\\").  Second, the one I received had a crease before I even started messing with it.  Third, it bubbles up like there's no tomorrow during install and I'm not a newbie to installing these things.  I threw mine out and am waiting for new ones to arrive from a more well known screen protector company.  Overall, this is a good value and seems to be the best case that is available for now.

B0053TMP24|2.0|When I first started reading this my first thoughts were 'give me a break here, amazon.' I had pre-ordered this book on amazon and when it came twelve hours early I was jumping for joy. I like the Percy Jackson books because they're all about Greek (and Roman) mythology. But when I see<br />  new paragraphs where they don't belong and word sthat are spaced wrong, I got annoyed. I couldn't believe amazon would allow this for a book I paid for. the freebies have similar problems but I've never cared. You get what you paid for. But come on, I paid $10 dollars for this and they couldn't even give it one last look-over before releasing it, really? They could of posted it the next day and I wouldn't have been the least bit mad at them. But instead, they rushed it out and paid the price. Maybe when it was converted to kindle format it was messed up (I honestly don't know how that works) but that's no excuse for an internet powerhouse like amazon to look so unprofessional. (Update: Amazon seems to have fixed the typos in an update)<br /><br />But my rant on the format is pointless, most people who like Percy Jackson books won't care. So, I'm going on to the actual book, which was better than the last but getting even more repetitive. If I ever meet Rick Riordan I'd only have one thing to say to him: why do you always make the story patterns so obvious? Honestly, in every book in which there are only three demigods that go on a quest, two always fall in love at the end. I know Riordan wants this book to be liked by both genders but he's alienating half his audience, the boys, by always have characters fall in love like that. I've put up with it in the past, but when (spoiler) Tyson falls in love with a harpy(un-spoiler), I'd gotten pissed. Riordan needs to learn that love is not that easy. Everyone doesn't fall in love that fast and both sides don't always feel the same way either. Riordan makes love sound like the easiest thing in the world.<br /><br />He also makes the quests seem pretty easy except when he needs a little extra drama. Then he'll have the demigods barely make it through alive, just to jazz things up a little. Riordan also forgot about one of his own rules, that giants can only be killed with the help of a god. And, unless the horse is a god, that didn't happen. On many occasions throughout the book, he forgets to explain things too. Why and how can demigods speak to people in their dreams so easily? (spoiler) Why is Nico with the Romans and how did he get away with it? (un-spoiler) And I'm (unfortunately) not even done with complaining. Riordan goes so far as to mix up the facts. There are no Northern Lights in Alaska during the summer. I know because I was there around the same time, for two weeks, and I never saw them. They always come out during the winter. Riordan also did his math wrong; there are only six months between solstices but he says eight. Both are small details over all, but they're also so small that Riordan doesn't even need them and could have changed the amount of months so no one would get confused. Lastly there's the Romans, who act just like I thought they would except when they learn Percy's Greek. They barely react to that. Reyna's an issue too. I can't relate to her at all. I'd assumed that since Jason liked Piper a strong, beautiful, kind and caring person, Reyna would be similar, at least generally. (spoiler) Reyna's definitely strong, maybe beautiful too, but she's also manipulative and only cares about herself and keeping Rome safe. When Percy shows his worth Reyna turns her back on Jason, who she obviously misses, and goes over to Percy just to save her own skin.(un-spoiler) I just don't see Jason falling in love with that kind of person.<br /><br />I'm sorry that this is long and angry, I'm just so disappointed. This book had so much promise. I've been looking forward to it for the past year, the least Riordan could do was make sure it was worth reading. All he's doing now is what he'sbeen trying to do all along: get kids to care about Ancient Roman and Greek culture. He did succeed there, but could he at least make it a good enough read for everyone? I hope Riordan changes up his strategy a little, for his own sake, because I don't understand how someone who came up with such a creative idea for a series could not come up with anymore.ids to care about Ancient Roman and Greek culture.

B001HZK8FY|5.0|I just received this product in the mail today and I could not be any more pleased! I paid less than $14 for this product and it was worth every cent. I love The Notebook (the movie and the book) so when I came across this product on amazon, I just had to take advantage of such a wonderful offer. I know the WHOLE entire script to the movie verbatim... this shows just how in love I am with the movie. Everytime I watch it, I can't help but cry. No exaggeration. I really can't explain why I love this movie as much as I do, but I do know... that Noah and Allie share the kind of love that people go their whole lives yearning for but never finding. I don't know if real love (like displayed in the movie) is even real or if we are even capable of experiencing, but it must be the best feeling in the world to know that there is someone who loves you unconditionally and loves you just as much as you love them. Anyway, back on focus - this product is worth the cost and I advise all \\"The Notebook\\" lovers to make the purchase! You won't be disappointed. :)
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Both the old timey TRON movie and this one are awesome.  And the Daft Punk soundtrack bumps it up even more.  Slick visuals and a decent story make this one of my favorite \\"fun\\" movies.  I so want one of those suits for Halloween!  I'm not afraid to wear skin tight latex, I can pull it off.  I know, this review is stupid, but it's not like anyone doesn't know WTF Tron is all about...
B005COO1X6|4.0|It is an interesting concept but way to short. I feel taken. I paid for a short story with a preview for his new novel that is going to be released. An abuse of the \\"Kindle Single\\" category.
0385534639|5.0|What lacks in character development, the setting and atmosphere make up for in full. When I was reading this book, I felt like I was there, at the circus, and could not stop myself from reading. When I have to put the book down, I find myself leaving this magical world and suddenly waking up to the real one. If you love intrigue, good writing, and just want to escape into a different realm, then this is the book for you. I have not yet finished it, so I can't tell you if I liked the ending or if the plot ties together neatly, but I am not in a hurry to get there, because the ending is not as important as the journey.
0553805371|3.0|Stephen Hawking is not only, without question, one of our greatest surviving physicists, but also, remarkably given his disability, one of the field's great communicators and educators. Having enjoyed his previous writing I was very much looking forward to his insights on the cosmological advances since \\"A Brief History of Time\\". However, although this latest book is both entertaining and thought provoking, it ultimately left me frustrated with its failure to properly explain these new scientific concepts.  This is a small and unthreatening book, especially in the Bantam edition, and nicely put together with some apposite cartoons and a series of chapter endplates which develop a recurring graphical theme in multiple contexts. However, in contrast to previous books, especially \\"The Universe in a Nutshell\\", it's very light on genuinely explanatory diagrams and equations, forcing the user to try and comprehend complex physical and mathematical concepts from purely textual explanations.  The first third of the book deals mainly with the evolution and nature of scientific \\"laws\\", and the meaning of reality relative to our various mental models. This is very interesting, but perhaps a little ironic given the authors' statement on the first page that \\"philosophy is dead\\". What other label should be attributed to this discussion?  The next section explains key aspects of quantum theory, in particular wave/particle duality, probabilistic rather than deterministic behaviour, and the effects of observation on the system. That we can now demonstrate this behaviour for relatively large objects, and affect the observed outcome from behaviour originating some considerable time before the observation, is fascinating.  Since Newton science has developed a series of theories describing the workings of our universe, and has then attempted to combine or extend them to provide an ever more comprehensive description. The next section of the book describes this progression. The descriptions of classical physics, relativity and quantum theory are fine, and don't suffer too much from relative brevity as the older theories will be broadly familiar to most readers. However the pages on M-theory are really too brief, and don't adequately explain it. Finishing that section with the fact that M-theory admits 10^500 solutions makes it sound very far from the elegant theories espoused earlier in the book.  The final section of the book attempts to describe and explain some of the most problematical aspects of current cosmology, but in my view doesn't make a very convincing job of it. Cosmological problems include both the fact that universal expansion is still accelerating, and that our current model requires the young universe to have spontaneously \\"inflated\\" from coin-sized to many times galaxy sized in less than a second. Neither of these are well explained by current theories as I understand them, and this book doesn't bridge the gap. Earlier in the book the authors pooh-pooh theories relying on \\"then a miracle occurs\\", but don't seem to be proposing something much better.  Instead of proposing a theory which explains the observations, the authors seem to be saying that under M-theory all things are possible, and we choose the set of outcomes which matches our measurements. To my mind this is perilously close to saying \\"God created the Universe as it is\\", even though the authors are at pains to refute precisely that interpretation.  It feels to me that Physics is on a threshold similar to its position in the late 19th Century, where we are creating progressively more arcane versions of existing theories in an attempt to prop them up, but what is really required is fresh new ideas - the 21st Century equivalents of Relativity and Quantum Theory. This book confirms that need, but its suggested resolution does not convince me.
B005BZQS1E|3.0|This movie was worth a watch, but probably not much more.  It was actually pretty silly, and a lot of the acting was pretty sub par.  Sometimes these kind of movies can be pretty funny, but this one was a bit cheesy.  Rent it first.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|This album is probably one of the best albums of 2011. If you like thrash metal, then this album is for you. Every song rocks on this thing, no ballads, no fillers, nothing, just kick-ass rock. This band is back and better than ever. I hope they make more albums like this in the future with Joey B.
0071636080|4.0|I got this book barely 2 weeks before I heard of the passing of Steve Jobs.   To be honest, I've barely gotten to chapter 3 due to my busy schedule. From what I've read however, I've gained really good tips that would help me in my presentations.   As the shock of Job's death slowly sinks in, I cant help but smile sadly and think that at least I've had the honor of owning his book and his presentation secrets.   I'm sure it will be a fantastic read!  Godspeed, Steve!
B005ELZKWS|5.0|New chickenfoot album is better than the first. The vocals are incredible and the guitar work by Joe is way better than the 1st album. The solos really rock. I thought that the songs on the 1st album all sounded the same and I didnt really want to listen to it much. This album is different because the songs all have different sounds to them. Sammy singing is great here too, like always. Even some of his lyrics are different from his usual stuff. I like the 3 1/2 letters song, it's different. There is a couple of slower songs that are really good as well. Chad Smith and Michael Anthony tear it up as well. Great album overall and the recording of it is splendid, sounds really good in your car. CRANK IT UP TO 11!
B0055MI8K2|5.0|I have worn Teva sandals since 1990s. This is my most recent purchase, and I am VERY happy with it.   For one thing, in boots and most shoes, I wear an 11.5 or 12 EE and I have an extremely high instep. So some fittings are problematic, even when sized properly.  These sandals come only in D width, and yet an 11 D fits me perfectly. I have to let the straps out a bit, but they feel great, don't move around when walking, and the quality is every bit as good as the first pair I got 20-some years ago.  Its no wonder Teva is still around after more than 2 decades. They make great products, these sandals included.
B002ZG99IG|3.0|I was hoping that the movie will be as good as I thought of the movie trailer. However, it turned out okay. Minka Kelly was definitely an angel as it is in the ABC TV series \\"Charlie's Angels. She and Leighton Meester, I swear, kind of look like each other.

I've started a discussion on this book here:     <...>    Would enjoy your input.
034552554X|5.0|What a splendid first novel this is. Unforgettable. As a reader who averages a book a week, reading for pure entertainment, I do not always remember the plots or characters in many stories for very long. This book is an exception. I don't think I will ever look at a flower again without thinking of parts of this novel. The same can be said for Victoria, the central character in The Language of Flowers. While you want to shake her for her the way she is living her life, you will hope for her and cheer for her, and most of all, you will never forget her. The writing is also extra ordinary, beautifully phrased and sparkling in dialogue. Aside from being entertained, it is so nice to be informed and educated. Reading this story taught me so much about flowers, about the effects of foster care and about human nature. It is to be hoped that we will see more from this fine writer. Her first publication is highly recommended.
B0045HCJRG|4.0|Humorous look at what it was like to live in the 50's. Remember the fallout shelters?I first saw the video with a group of friends at one of their houses. We were all in that age group and laughed throughout the entire movie. Younger folks might find it a bit too corny - kind of a \\"had to be there\\". Wanted to share it with some other friends and my kids (in their 30's) but couldn't find it anywhere - even to rent. Thanks to Amazon I now own it. Great cast!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I can't believe I missed this movie when it first came out, but on the up-side it was a wonderful recent find for me. The storyline is compelling, and the acting is superb! Scenes and stage sets are realistic and add to our understanding of North vs. South. If you like period dramas, and haven't seen this one, you are very likely to be truly captivated!
B004UID2LC|4.0|it is sad that people use antivirus.  that app alone causes more problems than it fixes.  freedi works fine on my gs2 and my Sammy tab.  people that use antivirus are just ignorant.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I have any version I need right at my fingertips. You can download them too so you can still use it in dead zones. Great reading plans to go through the Bible in a year as well. I highly recommend this if you want an easy to use on the go Bible.
0553328255|2.0|The typeface is very small.  This is a problem with buying books online; there is just no way to know if the font used is  average-sized and readable -- or excruciatingly tiny and sure to bring on a case of eyestrain.  These books are the latter.<br /><br />If microscopic print doesn't bother you, these two are a very nice set in a shelf-box. I'd love them - except I can't see them.  Too bad, really.<br /><br />Since there is no preview that can inform a potential buyer as to font-size, I felt my review would focus on this, so as to alert those interested.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I have been searching high and low for a set of headphones that were digital audio without needing a digital audio to standard audio converter.  And these fit the bill. They don't get interference from my plasma tv, which I am happy about. I only wish they would charge on the stand like other styles of headphones I returned.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|I love this album. This a one talented group of musicians. The music just makes you want to move. I can't pick a favorite song they are all fantastic.
1609611543|5.0|Stumbled across this book on another site, and thought I'd take a gander.  I am sure glad I did!  Also so very glad the author let us take a peek inside.  Any one with health issues owes it to themselves to read all the excellent research information that Dr. Davis has gathered for us.  He has put it altogether in layman terms, making it easy for anyone to grasp the impact that modern wheat has on our bodies. Not to mention all the the lies and subterfuge out there, in an effort to keep us oblivious to the dangers; and all for MONEY!  I applaud your efforts, Dr. Davis.  Thank you for caring enough to write this great book.
B005BQTUVI|5.0|I'm glad this finally came to Blu Ray. It took quite awhile and I've been waiting. The first important thing to comment on is the Directors involvement. Robert Rodriguez really dropped the ball on \\"From Dusk til Dawn\\". But not here. Guillermo(sp?) may have disowned this movie prior, which he admits but it's not a bad film. He simply disowned it cuz, as everyone knows, The Weinsteins can be aholes. They meddled where they shouldn't have.  If you know about this movie then there is no sense in rehashing the tale. There is certainly a more religious tone to this version but this is closer to the director's vision.  All that been said, I'm assuming that the subway scene was one that had been replaced. There is an almost UNFORGIVABLE amount of grain in this shot. For a blu ray, you expect every scene to pop. I understand that you are limited by the source material when it comes actual transfers onto BR, however that scene, and when you see it, you'll see what I mean, needed more TLC than it recieved.  All in all, I'm satisfied both by the movie itself and the price I got it for. In the event that I would have been disappointed, being $10 would've allowed it to sting less. Still would've sucked, just not as much.  If you bought this movie, than most likely you already loved it, as it's a creepy little number that flew under the radar. If you're new to MIMIC, pop some popcorn, grab a soda, hit the couch with your favorite can of RAID and ENJOY!
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|In short, the movie isn't bad... but it just felt like all of the action was a glorified trailer. And Red Skull was kind of a panzy the whole entire time. Yup. That's my critique of this movie. This is an action super hero movie... why think too hard. lol
B005EHNMWM|5.0|Often labeled as Country-Rock or Americana, Jeff Tweedy and his gang of musicians that make up Wilco quietly evolved little by little with each release following their 1995 debut \\"A.M.\\" When Wilco released \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" in 2002, however, they threw any pre-conceived notions their fans had about the band out the window.<br /><br />Sure, Wilco offered up glimpses of clever experimentation with \\"Being There\\" in 1996 and \\"Summerteeth\\" in 1999, but \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" blended experimentation with a supremely well-written and diverse collection of songs to formulate one of the finest albums of the decade by any artist.<br /><br />\\"The Whole Love\\" is Wilco's eighth studio album. Although the band has always been granted a good deal of creative freedom with their recordings, \\"The Whole Love\\" is also the first record released on their own label, dBpm, which gave them the time necessary to try some new ideas. From the downbeat of the opening track, \\"Art of Almost,\\" it is perfectly clear that this is, once again, a new Wilco.<br /><br />\\"Art of Almost\\" opens with the sound of a needle hitting a record as drums, bass, and synthesizers build on a minute-long instrumental loop. Before listeners begin comparing Wilco's new album to Radiohead, however, the electronic loop fades into a vast sea of strings that hold onto an elaborate chord until Jeff Tweedy's unmistakable vocals make their first appearance of the record. As the seven-plus minute opener develops, many new instruments and sound effects are introduced which assist in creating a wave of dynamics that is often lost in most modern recordings. \\"Art of Almost\\" is easily one of the most ambitious songs Wilco has ever released and to open \\"The Whole Love\\" with such a recording is a statement few bands could make successfully.<br /><br />\\"Art of Almost\\" is followed by \\"I Might,\\" a track that feels much more familiar, but still holds onto an edge of unproven additions. Balanced by a repeating, catchy hook and weighing in at just under four minutes in length, \\"I Might\\" is groomed for radio, but still pushes the boundaries of a customary pop song. Matched up with \\"Dawned on Me\\" and \\"Born Alone,\\" \\"The Whole Love\\" begins to feel like a blend of Wilco's popular early hits and critically acclaimed visionary performances from their later years.<br /><br />Wilco has always had a knack for properly balancing a track listing in an effort to prevent listener fatigue and their art is perfected on \\"The Whole Love.\\" Typically trading upbeat hits with more emotive slower tracks, Wilco's clever song placement holds the attentions of fans both new and old on a straight through listen.<br /><br />Never does one particular style feel played out, nor does the urge to hit the skip button ever arise.<br /><br />Although the album opens with the most ambitious track in the instrumental sense, a 12-minute closing number, \\"One Sunday Morning\\" puts Tweedy's heart on his sleeve and takes as many chances lyrically as \\"Art of Almost\\" does musically. The beautiful acoustic song is as simple an arrangement as \\"The Whole Love\\" offers giving Tweedy the perfect showcase for his talents as a poet. Tweedy's vocals remain quiet and unwavering, never truly capturing the power of his words, but by the time the song finally concludes, the emotions he clearly feels are shared by the listener. It is a truly unique listening experience for Wilco fans and one very few songwriters have ever been able to pull off with any amount of success.<br /><br />\\"The Whole Love\\" is a celebration of freedom for Wilco.

B004XVMCPI|4.0|For those who enjoy slapstick humor, this is your movie. It's a crazy mixsture of soccer and martial arts with an underlying theme of good versus evil. Of course, good triumphs in the end.   Simply put, it is a fun family oriented movie that provides more than a little humor. I would recommend it as a light weight comedy with some humorous special effects. A very good family movie.     Roger Longo
B000ELJBAK|5.0|I have always been a fan of David Gilmour.  His whole career was fantastic.  This is a very good album.  If you like Pink Floyd, you will love this. This is one of my favorite albums. I keep it in my truck because it has great songs to drive to. Buy it!
B004VMX5TQ|4.0|Yes, \\"Let It Rock\\" remains in it's abridged form, but it appears on \\"Live Bullet\\", and that is the better of the two live records, so that just isn't that big a deal to me. I like the record a lot and love the low price. Stop whining and dig the Bob Seger live experience. This is some quality rock and roll !
B000ELJBAA|4.0|This is a very good album.  However, his 1978 album was much better. I listen to this cd occasionally. His guitar work has always been impressive. In my opinion, David Gilmour is the best guitar player ever!
B004EPYZZI|4.0|Great family movie, enjoyed by adults and kids as well as teens. The shark part was done well, not too graphic for my eight year old
B000002A3T|5.0|I love Pink Floyd(except the early Syd stuff). I have most Pink Floyd albums.  Not counting several live official cd/dvds and some un-official bootleg footage.  The Division Bell was a great way to end Pink Floyd's legacy.  The whole tone of the album is fantastic. It really makes you think about your life when you actually listen to what the songs say.  Gilmour has always been my favorite musician. I think Pink Floyd did just fine without Roger Waters.  Although Waters did have the best lyrics, Gilmour replaced that gap with his overwhelming music style.Its a solid album....BUY IT.    *As of August 2014 I now own the 2014 Vinyl Lp. The vinyl LP was pressed by Quality Record Pressings in the USA. The sound is about like the 2011 remaster cd except sounds a bit more 3D. The quiet parts are dead silent! And the bass and treble are great. If you want a good vinyl listening experience, this would be it a great choice. I can't wait for the new Pink FLoyd album - The Endless River -  coming in just a month or so.

B004GTLFNW|2.0|I bought this book because I thought it might provide additional insight on body weight training.  The author's background suggested a training where overall fitness is a vital role.  He implies that he models the military's (i.e. Special Forces) fitness training.  However, this book appears to contradict the actual published documentation of the fitness programs used to condition our nations elite fighting forces.  As an example, it seems that the candidates for the Special Forces do push ups, pretty much non-stop all day, every day.  I have not seen a day of rest between muscle groups.  His book recommends one.  As another example football players still do calisthenics everyday where pushups and other body weight exercises are used.    The number of exercises and performance are presented in an unnecessarily complex manner.  A better book that organizes the exercises and keeps the number of variations to a minimum is \\"Convict Conditioning\\" by Paul Wade.  His book focuses on 6 foundational body weight exercises with 10 levels of difficulty per foundation.  The one good feature of this book is the part that covers nutrition.  It is a basic primer which provides insight to the physiological portion of our body's response to food.  This part of the book brought my rating from one star to two stars.
B005HPA2XI|5.0|My favorite album by Mastodon being Leviathan, this definitely different than all, it took some work but with repeated listening, comes great reward.  Honestly I'm thrilled they abandoned the concept. This is an album that touches on everything they have accomplished in the past and brings the listener a whole new bag of goodies. Performance wise and production, I have no complaints, absolutely fantastic. Brann really brings it and his talent is showcased incredibly. I'm listening now again and I just appreciate the quality more with every listen. My favorite songs have changed numerous times but standouts being The Hunter, Dry Bone Valley, Thickening, All the Heavy Lifting, Curl of the Burl, you know its all great. If you haven't seen Curl video, do so it totally took the ranking of that tune to a new level for me. Love the artwork. Excellent Lyrics. Mastodon did real nice all the way around and I love the one line of lyrics to close the album up on Sparrow. I will be spinning this and Machine Head Unto the Locust nonstop.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|i can read this book over and over and have. this is a beautiful story with a lot of disaster. i have read so many books and never read one that i could read right after i finished it but i could with this book. this is my  favorite book ever and from the start it will have you hooked. GET IT. read it. love it.
B005C5A6C0|5.0|Unto the Locust as of right now, album of the year for me and will make the list of my all time favorites without question. Always been diehard Machine Head, since day one. Didn't have the hate most had for Supercharger, even with it's faults, which it definitely had. Can't say how incredible The Blackening is to this day and Through The Ashes... my \\"it album\\", that came at a time in my life, that I not only needed it but I connected with, in such an emotional and heavy way, you know, one of those rare ones, people may be lucky to have really touch them, maybe only once in a listener's life.   Now 2011, welcome, Unto the Locust, something I hoped for and wow, couldn't have imagined, the greatest MH album to date. I keep reading in dfferent places, it's not The Blackening 2, like that is a bad thing. I for one, don't want the same, we had The Blackening. When you want that, listen to it. Actually, the nice thing is in my opinion, they took the structure of The Blackening, made it more compact/easier to digest and absolutely improved on every performance scale, vocals, playing, production etc..Unto the Locust is an absolute beast all on it's own, exactly the way it should be heard and judged!!!! Love Robb's production. Nothing clouds up the other. The drums just are the best they ever had on any MH album. Phil and Robb just shred and not in any repetitive way. I hear complaints bout the kids singing, the complaint seems so minor for the part they play and I think actually compliments the tune.    I wanted to pick favorite tunes and can't, this is a true album, great individual tunes but should be experienced in whole. I will say these guys kick out great cover tunes and the two on here are no exception, with The Sentinel just crushing. Definitely if you can, get the deluxe version. The artwork is really cool to and worthy of pointing out. In conclusion, this album seems to be going over well with many and as I listen now, I stand by my opinion, this is a MH masterpiece!!!!
0439023521|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is by far one of the best novels in the young adult genre ever written. Suzanne Collins wrote an intense dystopian book that is impossible to put down, even the second time through.<br /><br /> The country is Panem, separated into twelve districts and the capital. Every year to remind the citizens of the district of the power the capital holds, there are the Hunger Games. Each district must supply two tributes, one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and sixteen to go to the arena, where the tributes must fight each other to the death because there can only be one victor.<br /><br /> Katniss Everdeen is just sixteen years old when her twelve year old sister's name is called during the Reaping Ceremony and Katniss steps up to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games. Alongside Katniss, is another familiar boy, a classmate, Peeta. But only one of them will come home alive.<br /><br /> Collins is simply an amazing author. The story takes off right from the beginning and trust me, it's a constant page turner and every chapter ends with a cliff hanger forcing you into the next. The novel is so short that it is almost unbelievable because there is so much action and adventure packed in and absolutely nothing is rushed.<br /><br /> Katniss takes an amazing emotional journey. She goes from Katniss Everdeen to The Girl on Fire and it's hard for her to even know the difference. She even seems to have opposing ideas on boys. The first time I read this novel I didn't get into the romance at all, but upon reading it a second time I very much enjoyed the romance.<br /><br /> This book is a must, must, must read! Collin's took the cautionary tale that dystopian has to offer and made it accessible to teens. There is so much emotion in this book and it is absolutely brilliant.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I saw this live on Oct 2 and it was stunning. The set design was brilliant and the acting was supurb. I adore Sierra and Ramin as Christine and the Phantom. They're the best since Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford. I was disappointed that Michael Crawford didn't sing with Sarah Brightman. It would've made it that much more special. This is a spectacular musical and a timeless story that will live on long after we're all gone.
B005M5NDCA|5.0|Bought it the day it came out. I Love it so much, I hoped that the whole CD would be a wonderful one, and it sure is. He sings so Amazing and wish Nothing but the Best on his Success! CD is so Worth my purchase and my time!
B005LAZIRY|5.0|I fell in love with Opeth at an early age. I was attracted to them from the get go because the could blend amazingly deep almost ambient passages which lead to a satisfying metal encore, or visa-verse. Any opeth fan will be able to tell this has opeth written all over it. I read an article some time back that said Åkerfeldt fav. album was Judas priest Sad Wings of Destiny. I can see a little of that shinny thought into heritage. I wont be saying anything that prob hasn't been covered at this point. If anything this album and its obscurity makes me like them even more. Who likes buying an artists CD and hearing more of the same? I don't. Progression is good, But if you love opeth and all there diversity then you will love...well at least like...Heritage. Its a solid buy from a fantastic band. You will ultimately feel cheated if your expecting to pop this in and head band. But its a winner if you have ever enjoyed any of opeths lighter sides. \m/

B001CDLATE|5.0|Chronos [[ASIN:B0001Z48WU Chronos (Special Collector's Edition)]] was one of the first IMAX movies. It takes you to different places in world which is very stunning and educational.  The same concept is behind BARAKA [[ASIN:B001CDLATE Baraka [Blu-ray]]] with the same people but Baraka shows more of the culture and individuals than Chronos. First version was released in 1985 and now they have updated to Blue Ray DVD in 2007. Regardless, these are very entertaining and in order to see the film you need to watch it few times or use pause and rewind since these are extraordinary shots of extraordinary places and environments and there are so many colors and details that is a feast to the eye. Infact at the end of the films you can read in credits for the locations of their shooting and do more research and even visit those places if you happen to be a lucky individual. To be truly shocked, to see so many unbelievable places, HOME [[ASIN:B0026OE2O8 Home [Blu-ray]]] tops it all. All of these are masterfully done. If you have any appreciation for places, beauty, culture, religion, art, nature, details, color and more importantly god's creations you certainly will not be disappointed. Double Bravo.
B005H1SDQU|5.0|When I saw this new album and listened to the samples, I knew this was going to be a real gem of an album.  If you're like me, it's rare to find an album that you fall in love with and can't stop listening to.  Well, this is one of those albums.  While I became a fan of Mr. Hackett during the GTR and Guitar Speak era, I became infactuated with his album \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\".  His song writing is above reproach and guitar playing superb!  This album is glorious!  From start to finish, he takes you on a journey around the Earth globe, introducing you to inspired sounds that he no doubt obtained from his many tours to lands far and wide.  If you're new to Steve Hackett, this is an excellent album to sample his extraordinary talent.  You'll hear wonderful classical sound transition into rock and world music sounds throughout; the music flow is just grand.  If you're an old fan of Steve Hackett, don't wait to get this 2-CD album.  It is FANTASTIC!  I can't dismiss any of the songs...I love it all.  But if I had to highlight anything, it would be the first few songs of the first CD.  'Loch Lomond' is tremendous with a strong rock riff that interchanges with slow and captivating guitar work.  'The Phoenix Flown' displays Steve's wonderful guitarcraft...just GREAT!  'Prairie Angel' is rock anthem sound at its best, then leads into 'A Place Called Freedom' which just leaves me breathless every time I listen to it.  This is a GREAT album from a GREAT artist.  One to truly treasure.  Enjoy!
1847879071|3.0|Found this book helpful in using SPSS for my statistics class.  Somewhat complex at times and jumping around, but that could be due to the organization of my class and not the book.  Book arrived quickly and in good quality and I will use in future classes and jobs.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Superb performances by Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti and Rufus Sewell plus a labyrinthic plot makes this a riveting movie. In a nutshell, Norton is a stage magician who excels at his craft beyond anyone's imagination; his understated demeanor adds further mystery to his magic. Giamatti is the chief inspector in Vienna who admires the illusionist and attends many of his performances; his facial expressions speak volumes. Sewell is the Crown Prince who attends one of the performances with his fianc&eacute;e, which turns out to be Norton's childhood sweetheart and the love is rekindled. The Crown Prince is a rational, progressive, though arrogant, aristocrat and sees the illusionist simply as a magician, not having any supernatural powers, as many of his entourage believes, and he wants to, though is unsuccessful, in revealing him as a charlatan; though he is supposed to be the villain in the movie, I felt myself sympathetic to him (as well as the others). A chess game ensues between the protagonists and will say no more in order not to spoil the movie for the first time viewers.<br /><br />The movie is curiously shot in a sepia-like lens, this gives the movie throughout an unreal look to it; it also brings to mind the old, faded, photographs of long ago which have acquired the same tint.<br /><br />And hey! The movie was made without a single obscenity being uttered while remaining a great movie. You think this might catch on in Hollywood? Nah.<br /><br />I do have one complaint. The illusionist's tricks were supposedly done with the technology of the time. The director, however, got carried away and did a couple of tricks that even today could not possibly be made.
B004V8W54Q|5.0|There are three versions of Brazil: (1) the Universal travesty \\"love conquers all\\" cut, released over Gilliam's vociferous objection; (2) a compromise cut Universal later agreed to let Gilliam make after he embarrassed it enough; and (3) the director's cut, available on Criterion.  I have the Criterion DVD and haven't seen this blu-ray release, but it appears to be the compromise version per a review on a blu-ray oriented site and as also indicated in some of the other Amazon user reviews.  Amazon's review saying that it's the director's cut appears to be inaccurate.  The compromise version is o.k.; only the \\"love conquers all\\" hatchet job is to be avoided, but be clear on what you're buying.

1584282584|5.0|If you are a reader of the Tangents blog, a lot of the information presented in this book will be familiar to you.  Having said that, the convenience of having all of Neil's wisdom, in print, in one tome is well worth the price of this book.  His techniques are presented in an easy to understand fashion and the layout of the book is easy to follow.  If Syl Arena had only used this book's editor, his book could have been exponentially better!  I can't say enough about Neil's teaching style and this book brings together instruction and inspiration in such a way that you'll be reading it with camera in hand.  If you own a DSLR and a hotshoe flash, and you can only buy one book, buy this one.
B000001ED1|5.0|Joan Osborne's eclectic, visionary, poetic lyrics place her in a class by herself.  I can play it over and over again; I know the songs by heart.  She can go from the depths of feeling up to the elation of life in the wink of an eye.  Some of her songs have a blues song in the background. While other songs cannot be labeled, such as the freedom of the characters in her lyrics.  Joan Osborne's album is \\"must have\\" in one's repetoir of music collections.  I would play her when preparing a weekend American breakfast in Europe, to sing alone while preparing the meal.

B004NGXGJ4|5.0|Harper Lee is a literary genius.  She takes us into a quiet, hot summer day, one of which will break open in controversy ending in death, as told through the eyes of children.  They must explain racism, sexual desire, implied incest between a father and daughter, alcoholism, poverty and ignorance. Atticus Finch is the protagonist; however, Scout is the main character and she will be changed by Boo Radley at the end of the book.  I have lived in Mobile, Alabama, and my friend told me that Scout represented Harper Lee and Truman Capote was the boy who visited next door with his aunt.  I knew in real life they lived in adjoining counties.  One of my favorite themes is brought through the old lady next door.  Atticus makes his son read to her, even if his son finds her to be mean and ungrateful.  But Atticus reasons with him, explaining that she was sick. She was in a lot of pain, but did not want to be addicted to her pain medicine.  He said that strength was not shooting a gun; she was one of the strongest people I ever knew - she was beholding to nothing or nobody.  .  My high school Advanced English teacher Mrs. Scroggins, said that one should read a book, and read it again maybe one to two years later.  And it may seem as if it is a different book.  She said the book did not change, but our experiences changed. Those were some of the most sage words I have heard elicited, and this book I can re-read and never become tired.
B0056BU3I2|4.0|Lots of action, decent plot, all the stars back from the other movies, what more could you ask for? They set it up nicely for the 6th installment also. Looks as though Letty will be back also which would be good. Eva Mendez looks to be reprising her roll as well in the 6th installment. If they keep putting out good movies like this keep it going.
0143039482|5.0|Ethan Allen Hawley was a man who had it all; money and more importantly status in their small town community.  A person's ego is carried into their profession, the amount of money they earn and their social status.  And it is one way to climb up the ladder. But it is another matter to fall from the ladder, as if one has fallen from the grace of God.<br /><br />When I was 14 I picked up this novel and I had read most of Steinbeck's classics of my own volition. But this one was so sad, and the protagonist, Ethan could not catch a break.<br /><br />So he went from high society to managing a grocery story. And he had to eat crow at the social events, with people feeling sorry for him as he owned so much and lost it; he felt like hiding under a rock.<br /><br />He had an affair because he felt he had nothing to lose.  Similar to his suicide attempt, life just kept on beating him down.  But it was not life beating him down; he had an inability to cope with life's situations and to adjust.  He had a job, could put food on the table, had a fine family. He had to work on his thin skin and needed to try to go out on his own to become an entrepreneur as his father was in years past. But it was his decision to choose not to try. He did not realize how much his daughter really loved him by replacing the razors in his pockets with her special rocks.  But could he man-up and accept what life had given him?<br /><br />These actions would help him focus on the positive instead of focusing on the past failures.  But all he wanted to do was feel sorry for himself; enough to leave a widowed wife and orphaned children without financial means.  He was selfish even to his death.<br /><br />I enjoy Steinbeck as he wrote about people in California along the coast.  He wrote of the people suffering in the Grapes of Wrath, a moral struggle between two brothers in East of Eden, Of Mice and Men, which culminated in one friend having to kill his mentally slow best friend, before the mob would tear him apart for touching a young woman. The there is Cannery Row and As I Lay Dying. This is just a small sampling of a large body of works.<br /><br />I would recommend The Winter of Our Discontent, as it brings the reader into the world of Ethan Allen Hawley and his trials and tribulations. Steinbeck does not write to fill the book just to meet publishing criteria - when it is done it is done.e is Cannery Row and As I Lay Dying. This is just a small sampling of a large body of works.

1609611543|5.0|I had heard about this book and ordered in on my Kindle the day it came out. For the past 9 months I have been following a Paleo/Primal diet and in fact had already limited wheat somewhat because it was a carb and had negative effects on bllod sugar and insulin levels. In that period of time I have lost 70 pounds and my blood pressure has dropped from 128/90 to 113/74 (I'm 60 years old). I knew wheat was not good for me as if I indulged in a pizza I got heartburn and couldn't sleep.<br /><br />After reading this wonderful book by Dr Davis I know why wheat has such a deliterious effect on our health. I have read a ton of books in the low carb field but Dr Davis' book is the first that described the modifications to the wheat plant since the 1970's and 1980's that have rendered it a far different plant than our grandparents ate or that existed in Biblical times. I had not realized that the 4 1/2 ft tall 14 chromosome plants that were spoken of as \\"amber waves of grain\\" had been replaced by genetically modified 42 chromosome dwarf and semi dwarf plants that upped production from 8 to 9 bushells an acre to 80 to 110 bushells an acre. These modified plants were never tested on humans. Compare the rise in the rate of diabetes to when this new \\"wheat\\" entered the food chain.<br /><br />His description of why wheat is so addicting was enlightening. Wheat is the only food that affects the opioid recpetors in the brain - and our health dictocrats tell us to eat more of this \\"healthy whole grain\\".<br /><br />We could cure our health care cost crisis if everybody took Dr Davis' message to heart. But that will only happen one person at a time. Archer Daniels Midland and Monsanto willl fight every inch of the way, as will the USDA whose mision is to push wheat and corn on us and most doctors will fight it also as their income would go down. The average diabetic is worth 6000.00 a year to the health care establishment; no let me refer to them as the disease and symptom management establishment. Do you think they are going to embrace a way of eating that will reward you wth health and cut their budgets and income? i think not!<br /><br />Read this book. I enjoyed it som much that I bought a hard copy so I could mark it up and have given copies of it to people who need this information.<br /><br />Dr Davis did great hour long interviews on Jimmy Moore's Livin La Vida Low Carb podcast and on Rob Wolfs Paleo Solution podcast. Listen to them and buy the book. Your health, longevity and quality of life are at stake.hey are going to embrace a way of eating that will reward you wth health and cut their budgets and income? i think not!  Read this book.

B001DJ7PN2|5.0|How does one put this particular film into any certain genre? This modern classic is not in any terms a normal historical drama, nor is it a drama in any normal sense. Oliver Stone has certainly created a piece of art here, something so grand that no matter how many viewings of this great picture, you will most certainly discover an unseen treasure that you missed the last time you watched it. The incredible oscar winning editing and wonderful cinematography of this relic will keep you intrenched into this incredible film the whole way through. The deeper one gets into this film, the stronger and more potent it becomes. Every actor in this film is incredible, reflecting a past reality so well, that at many times one forgets that this is actually a movie. For example, the scenes of the Kennedy autopsy are so dark and disturbing, but at the same time so intriguing that one cannot help but keep such images inside ones memory. Like a great movie JFK is a film that will remain with you always, and a film that keeps you wanting to see it again and keep asking questions about the greatest unsolved murder in our history.

B000006YCU|4.0|Dream Theater are one of my top 10 favorite bands and they have some real masterpieces, this one's not quite a masterpiece but it's amazing besides that. Charlie Dominici is the current vocalist here, James Labrie doesn't come until '92 Images & Words, this is from '89. It's a bit more amateur than their later releases and the production's dated but the music and lyrics are still well written and they put quite a bit of effort into it considering that it's their first album. The songs aren't as structured and organized, more simple for progressive rock/metal. Still their music skills are good and decent on a technical level, WDADU is a very enjoyable album. A Fortune in Lies is absolutely amazing and it's still one of my favorite DT songs.

B004HD61KE|3.0|James Rollins and Steve Berry must have each other on speed dial.  I imagine the conversation they must have had went something like this:<br /><br />Rollins:  So, I'm thinking of working some sort of Jeffersonian code into my next novel.  What are you doing?<br /><br />Berry:  I'm actually working on a Jefferson thing, too.  So, uh, I guess I beat you to the punch this time, ol' buddy.<br /><br />Rollins:  We-eelll, hold on a second.  Jefferson was a great guy.  He lived a long time.  He did many different things.  Maybe there's a way we could split this up and both profit from the Jefferson mention.<br /><br />Berry:  I get to use \\"Jefferson\\" in the title.<br /><br />Rollins:  I get all references to Lewis and Clark.  Plus, I claim the Mormon stuff. Mormons are hot right now. They're on Broadway!<br /><br />Berry:  Damn!  Why didn't I think of that?  Okay, umm, I'll reference PIRATES.  Pirates are hot right now, what with Johnny Depp and all.<br /><br />Rollins:  Did Jefferson have anything to do with pirates?<br /><br />Berry:  Who cares?  Was he a Mormon?<br /><br />Rollins:  Point taken. Best of luck on the new novel.<br /><br />Berry:  Same to you, chum.  Same to you.<br /><br />This was a great romp through American and Native American history, along with enough surprises and shocking twists to keep me turning the pages.  As Rollins novels go, this was one of the best in recent memory.

B000002LUB|5.0|Black Sabbath's Dehunaizer is an excellent album and I'd recommend getting it. It's arguably their heaviest album to date and one of their darkest. It's easy to tell it's from the early '90s by the sound and production but it isn't extremely dated either. Also Ronnie James Dio made a comeback and it's equal with \\"Heaven And Hell\\" and even surpasses \\"The Mob Rules\\". Some of the songs sound a bit like '83 \\"Born Again\\" except it's a better album. There's a lot of doom metal in the songs except for a few faster paced songs like TV Crimes, Time Machine and Master Of Insanity. Dehumanizer is one of Dio's best and Black Sabbath's best offerings.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|So I have a Baby Jogger City Mini. I bought both this parent console as well as the baby jogger one and tried them both out. I'm keeping this one. The other one just doesn't seem to be that much better. With shipping and all this one was less than $15....and the other was about $31.  I would say that if you are going to want to fold your stroller up with out emptying every little item out of the stroller you should get the baby jogger console. I do like that I can just toss stuff in this one without paying to much attention.  There is a small mesh zippered pocket on the inside of the largest section....very small. The cup holders are very accommodating. With some effort I got a really secure fit and nothing sloshes out of my cup.  They both have advantages and disadvantages. They are both really well made products out of nice material. It's just a style issue and how you will personally use it.
B000BTJDGC|2.0|This film, while dealing with the phenomenon of demonic possession, seems loaded with intrinsic disclaimers that it was not supposed to be another \\"The Exorcist.\\" The film took the angle of a psychiatric explanation versus a supernatural one, but Mr. Director seemed to think that sustained tension would render his film too similar to William Friedkin's and subsequently thought that too much immediacy as a film-making technique was something less than valid. This made the experience all the more disappointing because the \\"possession\\" sequences really did have promise, until that potential was quashed by a sentiment that seems to whisper \\"whoa there cowboy, yer s'posed to be understated!\\" Unfortunately for the outcome of this film, its subject matter and undeniable goal of creating frightening scenes means that not only are some comparisons to The Exorcist inevitable, but some are also wholly justified.<br /><br />There is a nightmarish moment when a platonic male-friend spending the night with Emily, out of genuine concern for her well-being, wakes up to find her horribly contorted on the floor, staring at him with blackened eyes. That would be an incredibly rude awakening, and an absolutely horrifying experience whether the cause were mental or not. After a pretty good sustained shot on Emily's face and body, she lets out a sound that can't help but be compared to Regan MacNeil's lion roar (remember when her eyes first roll up in their sockets). It sounds benign, even by natural standards. Perhaps what the director was going for here was slowly increasing demonic behavior, mingled with a little more of that \\"careful now\\" mentality. Immediately after this scene we're back in the boring courtroom with its government clerks, the tension completely dissipated and not helped along by the pretty but ultimately bland, blonde leading-lawyer-lady. Perhaps we could have cut to the lawyers having a heated argument - or somebody doing anything that might keep up the nervous tension, but the direction is simply not up to Friedkin's caliber.

B005HG4C4C|5.0|There's not much to say other than this album is the best Dream Theater release since Scenes from a Memory, Pt. 2. To be honest, I couldn't even listen to their last few albums, it sounded as if they mailed it in. Not to mention the rapping and stupid vocal decisions they made, I moved on to bigger and better things. In my eyes, Symphony X and Opeth's recent releases greatly exceeded Dream Theater's. Needless to say, when Portnoy left, I decided I would give DT one more chance to impress me. ....but I admit, I had  low expectations.   They proved me wrong...After listening to this album over 30 times, I can truly say this is a progressive metal masterpiece. If you love progressive metal or just appreciate great song writing and creativity, there is no way you CAN'T love this album. Long, progressive songs mixed in with shorter ballads really balance the album as a whole and make it easy to listen to cover to cover. This is something I had an impossible time doing with their last few releases. The best way to describe this album is that it's just impressive. The song structure and long instrumental sections are the best I've heard since Images and Words. Outcry, Bridges in the Sky, and Breaking All Illusions are the highlights for me. I sit and listen in awe at the musicianship and creative song writing. I'm not a big fan of James Labrie, but he definitely seems like he's more into this album vocally. It seems like he actually cares about what he is singing. I know this album will be in heavy rotation for a while.   In short, if you were sick of Dream Theater like I was, listen to me and get a hold of this album. You will not be disappointed, this truly is a great release.

B0022W6L6G|5.0|It includes only the classic post-1975 Fleetwood Mac greatest hits and only goes up to 1987.  That's understandable because this CD came out in 1988 and besides \\"Say You Will\\", 1987's \\"Tango In The Night\\" was their last good album anyway.  When co-lead singer/guitar player Lindsey Buckingham left after that album to focus solely on his solo career, he had decent success.  But, as far as Fleetwood Mac, other then a couple okay songs in the mid-1990's, the band wasn't good anymore.  Luckily he rejoined them in 1997.  The track selection for this CD is very good.  It includes many songs you're sure to know or forgot you knew.  What else can I  say?  I wish it included \\"Landslide\\", \\"The Chain\\" and \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" and maybe a few Peter Green songs from the 1960's Fleetwood Mac.  \\"Oh Well\\" from 1969 at least.  Maybe even Bob Welch's original Fleetwood Mac version of \\"Sentimental Lady\\" from 1971.  But, they were focusing on the band's most commercial and successful period.  Overall it's pretty good for a single disc and worth the money.<br /><br />If you want more I'd definitely seek out the double-disc \\"Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac\\" from 2003.  Again, it only includes classic post-1975 Fleetwood Mac but it includes both \\"The Chain\\", \\"Gold Dust Woman\\" and many others.<br /><br />If you're looking for 1960's Peter Green Fleetwood Mac, I'd seek out the complete remastered 1967-1969 Blue Horizon Sessions boxset.  Also, their first Warner Brothers album and last one with Peter Green, \\"Then Play On\\" from 1969 which includes \\"Oh Well.\\"  Unfortunately it hasn't been remastered.<br /><br />The early-1970's are the more obscure albums.  None of the Warner Brothers albums released between 1970-1974 (most of which feature either Christine McVie or Bob Welch on vocals) have been remastered yet either but are still worth a listen.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|My 6 year old son is really into Star Wars. He loves 1, 2 & 3 and I love 4, 5 & 6, so I bought this for him (us). He was so excited when he saw the set and pop in episode 6 right away (not sure why he picked 6 but I was ok with that). He sat right next to me as we watched the movie. Watching him brought back many childhood memories and how I felt watching these films. I am really glad that I can experience these films again with and through him.   For the content itself: The picture is breathtaking and I am noticing thing in the films that I never saw before. Maybe it's because I've seen them so many times before that my eyes are wondering but there is so much more to see in HD. The sound is also incredible and I only have a 5.1 system. I also, like all of the changes they made to the films, I think that it helps blend the series together and make it a unified story. A lot of people on here are Star Wars purist and only want to own the original version of the films. I think that Lucas should release the originals for those people but remember the originals were not in HD. So, IMO, changing the picture quality is also changing the original film. I guess they want it both ways. Oh well, to each their own...
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I bought this set thinking the changes Lucas made are being exagerated by reviewers... well, the \\"Darth Vader Nooooo!\\" scene truly has been ruined; it's ridiculous with the additional dialogue. Also, Obi-Wan's call to the Sand People in Episode 4 has been ruined. I didn't think these changes would bother me; but they really do. All I can say is no wonder Lucas is so rich; I never thought I would need to buy a copy of the original, unadulterated Episode 4-6, but if they are ever cleaned-up and re-released, I will definitely have to get them. Lucas has finally made just enough changes for me to really look forward to forking-out more money for this movie one last time. But one last time only...ya hear me, George? Your plan worked brilliantly.
1596432594|5.0|As a great admirer of Feynman, I was intrigued by a graphics book about him. I highly recommend it, particularly to people who may not know who he was and what his accomplishments were. I have had occasion to talk to groups of math and science teachers and have been appalled that many did not know he is. This book should be required reading for all high school science teachers. It shouldn't be too hard, after all it is in comic book format.
B0052YAKS6|3.0|Honestly, the CD is not that great. His last album, [[ASIN:B002FKZ55I One Love]], really grew on me, but this one, I just find myself skipping track after track until I give up. It's a shame becuase he has some great people on this album: Sia, Dev, Jennifer Hudson, etc. Jennifer and Sia's song are Okay at best. I wouldn't recommend it, cause I didn't find anything outstanding one here. Too bad.

0307279189|5.0|I read this in less than a week. Originally I was looking for a travel novel, but this caught my interest. McDougall is an incredible, fun, funny, interesting writer. The stories he chronicles of the world's ultra-marathoners are so interesting. I was constantly reading this book and saying \\"no way!\\" he captures such incredible stories and triumphs of these racers. I just wish McDougall had more books out, he's such a great author!
0739375970|1.0|Wow!  This was painful to listen to.  Roy Dotrice may have a wonderful speaking voice but his reading of Martin's work was excruciating to endure.<br /><br />I've no idea where or why he got the idea that all of Martin's characters were either Scotish Highlanders or Cockney Louts - with the occasional poorly done Sydney Greenstreet imitation thrown in for good measure - but that's about all that populate his rendering.  As if that didn't rankle enough, the man vocalized _all_ the women - and I do mean _all_ the women - as 14th century Irish tavern wenches.  Even if they weren't smallfolk in the tale.<br /><br />Had this been my first exposure to what Martin created then I'd have gone no further with it and stayed away from the rest in disgust.<br /><br />You would think that as successful as Martin has been with this series that they would've gotten a more capable and fitting reader for his works.<br /><br />I hope they do so in the future as Dotrice is really an awful choice here.

B0006AAS5G|5.0|Every now and again a watch from Invicta comes out and I cannot simply fathom the low prices they command with the looks they have.<br />I realise that the Invicta $MSRP price is really no indication on what the watch actually sells for. I've found most of the models sell for 20-30% of the original $MSRP.<br /><br />This watch may not have Swiss movements but it makes up for it with a beautiful crown, dial and sub-dials. The bezel is beautiful, in fact I cannot fault the watch in any way cosmetically and aesthetically.<br /><br />This watch is almost a Rolex Daytona Replica and I have been stopped and asked if it was a Daytona, although I would absolutely love a Rolex I can't afford the $20,000 that a Daytona commands.<br /><br />Invicta have thus produced a very pleasing time piece, it looks the part and the movement isn't terrible, for the price I would challenge you to find a better watch, it would be difficult, especially in this price range.<br /><br />Invicta has done the \\"Speedway\\" range justice and the watch itself is very handsome.
9063692560|4.0|haven't finished reading yet. but good quality in terms of design and print. it's as good as most good textbooks can been. but there's a limit a textbook can do, esp for such a topic so new and inter-disciplinary. a good introduction, i would say.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Fell in love with the singing on this movie. Not the biggest fan of Gwynneth Paltrow, but enough strong leads from others to overcome her. Absolutely love the songs and was surprised to hear all actors sang themselves, not lipsinced. Great movie! Seller also shipped timely and DVD was indeed, like new.
0671449028|5.0|I gave this book to my two year old granddaughter.  Her Mom read it to her, and then had to repeat it two more times.  It immediately made the regular rotation of her favorite four bedtime books. It's the first book that she now \\"reads\\" to her Mommy, mostly in gibberish, but with enough real words to know that she is really telling the story of toothbrushes and jammies.  It's great fun.
B002VWNICW|3.0|I love Matthew Mcfadyen's work, all of it, and I think that Keira Knightly is a fabulous actress thus I was prepared to rank this version of Pride and Prejudice with the outstanding and pitch perfect Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thomas.  I was sorely let down.  I did not like 1995's version of Pride and Prejudice with Ehle and Firth because I felt it too shrill, and after a while Ehle's exaggerated facial expressions became annoying. I felt that the actors whom she was laughing at or thinking about had to be in a coma not to notice them.   Having said that I watched this version twice and still I could not get past the lack of chemistry between the two leads, and the camera movements which were dizzying.  The first dance sequence, the swing sequence in the farm yard, the soldiers marching through town, I felt that something was always moving in front of the actors obscuring them, and that the eye was constantly trying to find them in the picture.  When Tom Hollander showed up at the front door here was yet another scene where half an actor's face was cut off until he moves to the left.  A camera angle stolen right from Polanski's Rosemary's Baby.  Finally I felt it all too forced - especially the endless giggling and laughter.   I did love Dame Judy Dench who was severe and the cinematography and locations were outstanding which makes this purchase worth while at the current price.  The Blu Ray picture is beautiful.  The Blacks are rich and showing good detail even in Dench's dark estate.  The special features about the homes and locations are very intersting.

0393064476|5.0|I  went on  Amazon to order  the Swerve after  hearing a  discussion on the radio.  Generally  I  enjoy reading  the reviews.  Many are by experts in the field, others by those like me who have interest in many areas outside our careers.  I found  the negative review of Greenblatt's text informative  if  only  to  realize that many post opinions based only on opinion and not familiarity with the text the criticize.  And  so, I  restrained from writing review  until  I  had  read  the  text.  The Swerve  is  much  better  than  the review on  the  radio.  This  week  Sarah Blakewell  reviewed  the Swerve in  the  NYT.  Understandably as the penultimate chapter discusses Montaigne's reading and commenting on Lucretius.  I do enjoy Blakewell's  \\"How to Live  or  A  Life of Montaigne\\"  but  her prose is not as  felicitous as Greenblatt's.  Yet  she  too has multiple anecdotes and insights into  historical people and times which keep  the  reader alert.  These two popular texts along  with 1493 involve the reader in periods of  history often missed by students.  All  have  insights into the difficulties of life  today as seen in the history of  our world.  And  does one not  read history if only  to find information helpful for today?    That  Lucretius and others claimed to be  Epicureans may be  problematic.  I  was raised believing that Epicureanism stood for abject hedonism, an anarchistic view of  the world with visions of  wine woman and song.  That the words of  Epicurus are not available is a  small  issue.  That  Epicureans as well as others over millennia who dared to discuss or  believe other  than that which is the thinking of  the  true  believers  have been persecuted, flayed, and  burned at  stake was common throughout history and in  our own culture of hate.    The  final paragraph of the  Swerve notes  that  Jefferson and  Adams, two stalwart political foes and grand friends, continued to  correspond until the end.  At one point Jefferson  wrote what appears to be a paraphrase of Lucretius.  That both are Epicureans may be a push, but  they  both were randy, one within and the other around and about marriage. I heartily recommend  the Swerve.

0142419400|4.0|I know that nearly everyone has read and reviewed this book for me, but I am just getting off of the sweeping tour of Paris, and the anticipation rush from Anna and St Clair (I'll call him that not because I didn't feel effection for him, but because I'm not the fondest of E name.)<br />  I've seen so many positive reviews, I tried to wipe my slate clean before reading so that I could just enjoy (or not) the story before me. And enjoy it I did. It was a fast, fun, and romantic story that surprised me with the emotional depth at times. There aren't just cute and fun issues here, there are some hard ones--sickness, barriers to friendship, and just raw emotions from events playing out.<br />  I do sympathize with St Clair's reasonings behind Ellie, but I still have to say that it still didn't sit right with me. Sure, she's not there and his feelings for Anna are strong, but why drag it on? It would've been hard as a girl seeing it from Ellie's eyes, but I think that would've been the right thing to do.... I guess I just had to mention that because that's the one thing in the book that still nags at me.<br />  That is not to say that I thought negatively of the book, I loved it. Anna grows and learns so much, and she has a great (and wonderfully written) group of friends, and the tension between her and St Clair kept me on the edge of my seat.

1466276177|5.0|(See Imacbeth08's review for a synopsis)  A few days ago I reviewed The Woman in White (TWIW) giving it three stars, as I compared it -- fairly or unfairly -- to the novels of Wilkie Collins' contemporary and friend Charles Dickens.  After reading The Moonstone, and giving it five stars, I think I was correct in my estimation of TWIW.  In spite of the excellent plotting and some well-drawn characterizations, TWIW is intended as a sensation novel, just that and not much more.    The Moonstone, on the other hand, is a many-layered delight: satire, social commentary, well-plotted mystery, wonderful humor (that is never over-the-top, as it is in TWIW), delicious characterizations --  and serialization ending points that are suspenseful without being obviously contrived.  As in TWIW, the characters unfold the story in their own narrative, revealing their own individual personalities in the process, but this device of the author's was obvious in its contrivance in TWIW; in The Moonstone the device is far more subtle.  The \\"skeleton\\" of the story is boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy marries girl -- just as in TWIW -- but this basic story line is fleshed out masterfully, with a plot that includes Hindus sworn to recover a diamond stolen from a religious statue, a villain successfully masquerading as a humanitarian, narrow escapes for the hero (and a narrow escape for the heroine, as well), and oodles of coincidences skillfully presented so that the reader's willing suspension of disbelief is not disturbed.  This is a book to be savored.  Do not rush through it to uncover the answers to the mysteries -- although the temptation is great -- but enjoy the author's skill in plotting and the vivid characters he has created.  Keep reminding yourself that this book first came out in installments, and readers had to wait from the suspenseful end of one installment until the next installment appeared, possibly providing some explanations.    I don't intend to re-read TWIW -- I knowthe plot, and though some characters are worth revisiting it isn't worth my time to plow through 600 plus pages to do so.  I will, however, re-read The Moonstone, for the enjoyment I get from the author's skill.

3836527286|5.0|I wasn't expecting this book to be of such quality, nor as large, for the price! Instead of some hastily put-together collection, you are presented with a lovely, art book. Full of scenes from the sixties. As Linda's other book, Sixties, cannot be sent to Australia and is seemingly impossible to get a hold of, I bought this volume thinking it would at least have some of the same pictures. It has but it also has many photos of Paul and the family, aswell as notes written by Paul and two of her daughters. Regardless of how she may be viewed by much of the rock world, i dig her photographs and her spirit. Both of which, i think are captured in this volume!

B0055S348W|4.0|I got this on my Dell Streak 7 as a FAOTD from Amazon. My Streak had no printing app so this was very helpful. I'm not familiar with other printing apps so I can't compare to them but $12.99 seems a bit pricey for this.<br /><br />It found my WiFi printer without any trouble & connected easily. I have an Artisan 710 by Epson.<br />I had to install a few extras to read PDF files & my gmail but it was quick so no big deal. It printed from everything I attempted to print (email, docs, webpages, pictures...etc...) but it was very slow. It does the job & is great for simple printing jobs but I probably wouldn't use it for any lengthy printing jobs.<br />Since I had no other way to print from my Streak 7, I am happy to have this app because it does what I need. I don't know if its the app that is slow or my device but its sufficient.<br /><br />Update: Also using on my Asus Slider & it works great on that also.

B005CM9DX6|5.0|It was inevitable; musical genius can't be restrained to the limited confines of Death Metal or Heavy Metal or any other metal. Opeth turns a page and delivers one of the best albums of recent times. Yes, the mood is dark but, after all, how can it not be when \\"God is Dead\\"? Mikael just couldn't stand the thought of the band repeating itself. \\"We want to play music with no boundaries\\", he explains in the documentary.  Others have already reviewed the music on the album so I will not waste time doing so. But I will say that I give this record a sixth star for presentation. A second disk with a glorious 5.1 audio mix of the album (Dolby Digital AND DTS), 2 bonus tracks, a 1 hour \\"Making of Heritage\\" documentary, and expanded packaging with lenticular/hologram cover! Now, that's value for my money.  Good influence from friend Steven Wilson who also produces. Albums like this make me want to buy and own cd's again.  Good move Opeth!

Since so many people seemed dissatisfied with the earlier packaging and what was or was not included, I thought you'd want to know.

0439023521|2.0|I purchased this book because a couple of my friends were discussing the trilogy and I wanted to see what the fuss was about.  It was an easy read - I think I finished it in a day and a half - but the plot moves somewhat slowly and predictably.  The author isn't particularly gifted.  I was willing to buy the second and third books if I liked the first, but I am definitely going to pass on that opportunity.  I would not recommend.

0385344325|5.0|I don't often write reviews although I read 3-4 novels in this genre a week.  I have to say that  picking up a new Reacher novel is akin to my being a wild dog who has not been fed for weeks and is thrown a beautiful porterhouse steak- color it gone!  What is really great about this particular addition to a terrific series is that it could be the first Reacher novel you read and you would not have missed anything at all- not common with many series.  It was interesting for the author to take us back to the last Military Police mission of Reacher's Army service and watch the drama unfold.  Lee Child has created a strong character voice(to put it mildly) in Jack Reacher and his novels are consistently among the best in the modern day action hero genre.  I would love to see Reacher team up with Robert Crais' Pike with Elvis Cole thrown in for fun.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I can say that this film is brilliant! An ensemble cast bursting with brilliant performances. I can actually visualize Emma Stone, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer each being nominated for BEST ACTRESS. I can also visualize both Ms. Davis and Ms. Spencer BOTH WINNING the BEST ACTRESS oscar (ie; the first time in Academy history that two women from the same film win the award in a \\"tie\\")!!!!! This movie is, without question, a beloved masterpiece. Octavia Spencer will more than likely win a Supporting Actress oscar and a People's Choice award. Viola Davis is going to be the feature person at every ceremony next year.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, when you see \\"Abileen\\" (Davis) walking home, you leap to your feet crying and cheering her!!<br /><br />The Help is to be cherished!!!!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I think this is an important book in that it's so rare to have a first-person account (in diary form, no less) of a long-term abduction. That Jaycee was willing to share the details of her imprisonment is amazing, but I understand her stance that her captor should not be allowed to hold secrets over her. Jaycee's positive outlook is a testament to the strength of the human spirit.<br /><br />Having also read the two articles done about her in People magazine, I think it would be great if the world at large would leave Jaycee and her daughters alone to go about their lives in relative privacy and anonymity. Sure, she went through an unusual set of experiences, but that's over now. Let's leave the woman in peace to raise her daughters and enjoy her freedom.
006117758X|5.0|This is the kind of writing that makes me say to myself, \\"I'm never writing a memoir until I can write it like THAT.\\" This flawless attack on the pesky infiltrates of your past invites people in to see your dirty laundry. It's a risky job, and, therefore, admirable. Unless, as Charles points out several times in this book, you just don't have anything to lose. When you're a writer, you write. There aren't alternatives.   I will read this again, recommend it to friends, and find everything else I can. Bravo.
0316743003|5.0|A great book, one of the best that I have read in a long, long time! This book covers so much material. It is a history of the famous Lockheed Skunk Works and its military and spy aircraft. It is also the history of the technology and business practice behind those projects. The book is an autobiography of author Ben Rich and a biography of the Skunk Works creator Kelly Johnson. While covering much material the book is easy to read and follow. I found the book spoke to me in many different ways. I loved the behind the scenes look at top secret aircraft and a look at the technology that made it work. The business man in me enjoyed that way they included the business side of making it all work out. But the think I enjoyed most was the personal interactions between the author Ben and his mentor Kelly Johnson. By the end of the book I can truly say that I had feelings for both of these men and their determination! The book ends on a sad note with me realizing that I will never be able to meet either man. However, the Skunk Works lives on, and through it, Ben and Kelly are still flying high!

0785132619|4.0|Mark Millar and John Romita Jr.'s graphic novel Kick-Ass (which collects Kiss-Ass comics # 1-8) lives up to its name! The story grabs you and does not let you go. The main star of the story is teenager Dave Lizewski and the plot of the story is his desire to be a superhero. He has no super-powers but creates a costume and walks the streets looking for adventure. What he finds is more trouble than he can handle. Although the main characters are children, this is not a children's comic book. It has extreme violence and a many sexual situations.

B004FEL6GO|5.0|I got this at a good price when it was on sale.  It really transforms!  In the car mode, the wheels turns smoothly like a real car.  In the robot mode, it is posable and can stand on its own.  It is a bit hard to move some of the parts some times, and the instructions were a bit hard to follow at first, but after a few times, you get the hang of it.  I accidently pulled off one of the arms trying to transform it, but you just stick it right back on and it's fine.  The shipment came fast, but it was a bit damaged though - the windshield was cracked.

B005C5A6C0|3.0|Not what I expected from a Machine Head album. They clearly went in a new direction with this and it is lamentable. There are obvious influences from many popular movements, most notably metalcore with the melodic vocals in the choruses with the regular yelled vocals for the verses. This album is also much softer than others and is lacks the emotional power that I expect from Machine Head. It is very clear this album was very experimental for the band, with many different \\"things\\" incorporated into the songs and some strange introductions that often lasted well past their welcome. For me, the album was very disappointing and not what I want from a band that should be one of the most important names in metal right now. Suggested only for someone who already likes Machine Head and is interested, but don't go showing this to your uninitiated friends. If you're just looking at this band, I suggest \\"The Blackening\\" or \\"Through the Ashes of Empires\\" as those are some of the greatest albums in modern metal and both show the best of Machine Head.

1594744769|4.0|The books concept is very unique and the story grabs you from the beginning.It is the tale of young protagonist Jacob who grew up hearing his grandfather's bizarre tales of his youth and his wildy unbelievable adventures as a young jewish orphan in Wales. As a 16yr old, Jacob no longer believes his grandfather's tales, until something terrible happens to his grandfather and he is forced to view things differently. Jacob sets out on a journey to discovery the truth about his grandfather and the place he grew up. This YA story will enthrall and enchant teens and adults of all ages.  The book is laced with weird old photographs,that the author has woven into this wonderful tale.  I am told the author is working on another book .

B003Q6D25K|4.0|Paranormal Activity 2 starts out as a prequel to the original movie (starting several months earlier) and then moves forward to where the latter parts of the film are concurrent with Paranormal Activity 1.  In the first movie the fact that Katie had a sister was mentioned briefly but she was never seen.  In this chapter, the sister, Kristi, and her family are the main characters.  Kristi, her husband, and the husband's teenage daughter from a previous marriage, are welcoming a new baby into the family when strange things start to occur.  The major incident is an apparant home invasion with the whole house trashed but nothing seemingly taken.  After this event, the family has a number of security cameras installed inside and outside the house, and the rest of the movie covers what is caught on these cameras.  Inexplicable events continue happening, and the possibility of some supernatural prescence is increasingly raised by everyone except that the father of the family, who firmly thinks that's all nonsense.  Of course, the intensity of these otherworldly manifestaions continues increasing...  Much more backstory is given as to why all this is occuring, and although the hinted origins of the haunting are powerful, on the other hand it takes away a bit of the mystique.  In the first Paranormal Activity, I thought one of the things that made it so powerful and eerie was that no reasons were ever floated for what was happening.  The prescence fixated on Katie and, as we learned from her relating of events from her childhood, had done so before.  But the movie never attempted to explain why, or go in deep as to exactly what the prescence was or what it wanted.  Every discovery made, such as the photograph that turned up in the attic, raised more questions than it answered.  And I think that really made it scarier, the viewer was a much in the dark as to all the \\"why\\"s as the characters, and it feels like there may not even be any \\"why\\", at least not that a human could understand.  Any motivation or origin behind the entity and the haunting are left not only to the best guesses of the characters, but to the viwer's interpretation.  In Paranormal Activity 2, we get a much clearer picture as to why things are happening the way they are.  The explanations as to the origin of the hauntings is innovative and disturbing, but I almost think they should have left the origins here firmly in the 'unexplained' category, and they used the (admittedly cool) origin story in a whole different movie.  It looks like they're going to delve even further into the backstory in Paranormal Activity 3, and that could either go too far and rob the series of much of its mystique, or it could throw in some curveballs and restore that little portion that was kind of weakened.  That possible weakening of the air of the unknown is the only weakness here, though.  The origin is frightening in its own right, and the whole movie is very well done, tremendously atmospheric and possessing some great jolts.  As with Part 1, there's a mix of scenes that unfold very slowly and creepily, where you really have to watch to see the supernatural elements taking hold, and much faster, more explosive scenes where the entity is gaining strength and things are coming to a head.  Great acting and characterization.  Overall, it may not be quite as great as the first one (on some levels) but it's still a 9/10.  Definately one every horror fan has to see for him- or herself.
B000050XEI|5.0|I had just purchased this CD and was listening to it when I heard about the World Trade Centers being hit. The songs will always bring back full memories of that day and what I was doing.   A few songs bring flashbacks of specific things I was doing at the time I heard them. This will always be a CD I will treasure and listen to from time to time as long as I live
0670022411|5.0|This is the first in an exciting trilogy about witches, vampires and dameon. It is a mystery, a love story and an adventure laced with history. One of the best books I've ever read.<br />The protagonist Dr.Diana Bishop is studying old alchemical texts archived at the Bodleian Library, in Oxford when she requests the book, Ashmole 782 from the stacks. Unknown to her, this book has been missing and is wanted by vampires, dameon and witches for the secrets it holds. When she opens the book, she feels its power and can see hidden messages in it, but like all magic it scares her and she quickly puts it back. Diana is a descendant of the famous witch, Bridget Bishop of Salem, Massachusetts. Her Aunts are witches, but Diana doesn't have any magic or does she? After her brief encounter with the book, she has attracted the attention of dameons, witches and vampires. One vampire in particular is persistent; he is Matthew Clairmont, an attractive professor of biochemistry and neuroscience. When the witches and dameons demand she produce the lost book, Matthew steps in and thus the adventure begins.<br />I loved everything about this book from the deep historical details, to the world wind romance between Diana and Matthew. The other characters in this book are equally appealing. While some may not like the length of this book, I found the details enjoyable, and know they have helped to lay the ground work for the next two books in this series. I will be first in line to purchase book 2 - Shadow of Night, release 2012.
B004K8WPUQ|2.0|This has quite cheap build quality for the price. The cord on it is almost a joke and it's not a question of if it will break, but when. For the price charged, this microphone is overpriced given the low build quality and no 9V battery included in the box.<br /><br />Audio performance-wise, it's still best to get as close to the subject as possible for the best audio. You need to be within 6 feet from this mic or you are not going to be able to achieve professional sounding results using this mic across the room or anything like that. There is just too much room echo/ambient noise. That said, this is better than the built in mic on most cameras so it's not bad if you are close to it in a small room for example, or to get environmental or background audio out in the field.<br /><br />If you attach it to a boom pole so you can get it close to the subject, it can effectively be used for filmmaking productions.  Rode does sell an extension cable which seems of pretty good quality for a good price.<br /><br />If you do talking head type videos or product reviews, a lavalier mic would probably suit you better.<br /><br />This mic does have a relatively small size  which is quite convenient.

1905236042|1.0|I think stretching, breathing & relaxing is a good thing for kids. Unfortunately the definition of Yoga is: \\"A Hindu spiritual and ascetic discipline, a part of which including breath control, simple meditation, & the adoption of specific body postures.\\" Therefore I don't believe this is a practice that belongs in schools, it is a ancient spiritual, religious philosophy.  If you want this for your children , that's your choice. But keep it out of our schools where we loose our choice.
1423140591|5.0|Percy is BACK!!! While I loved The Lost Hero & Jason/Piper/Leo, I sorely missed Percy Jackson. He's back & how!! SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />So new Heroes:<br />Hazel - Daughter of Pluto (Hades), who can bring up the riches of the earth. It's funny how gold & gems keep popping up in her wake. But tough luck for anyone who picks these up, so it's more a curse than a blessing.<br />Frank - Son of Mars (Ares), who can shapeshift & is awesome in battle strategy. How cool is that!! Also, in Roman legacy, Mars (Ares) is a BIG deal & Neptune (Poseidon) isn't a very revered God (unlike in Greek mythology).<br /><br />And of course there's Percy - who's powers seem to have multiplied by tons. he's more powerful & somewhat more mature. From Hazel's POV, you actually learn that Percy is supposed to be handsome with a profile fit to press onto roman coins. I never saw Percy as good-looking from PJ books though - as all those were from Percy's POV & he never really talked about his own looks.<br /><br />Also, the book is a cliffhanger - major cliffhanger. The Greek Heroes (Jason, Leo, Piper & Annabeth) have arrived at Camp Jupiter, but the book ended before they could land their ship. Also, Hazel & Frank got together as a couple, but Hazel sees Leo in a message & he looks exactly like her supposed dead BF from her past life. Two love triangles in the making - Frank/Hazel/Leo & Reyna/Jason/Piper! Wonder how Riordan will incorporate these into upcoming books - I never felt he was very good with romance, but he managed the Percy/Annabeth story okay.<br /><br />I think this was even better than the lost hero for following reasons:<br /><br />1. This book talked more about importance of sacrifice.<br />2. The Battle scenes are written better than the lost hero.<br />3. PERCY IS BACK!!! Don't miss it<br /><br />I am biting my nails for the next book already...and that would probably release an year later.
B005POK858|5.0|Good old fashioned RPG, the maps however, are pretty much useless, and the characters often get \\"stuck\\" while walking. I like the variety of spells that can be upgraded (sometimes better left alone) and being able to switch around your weapons depending on the weaknesses of the monsters you are fighting. The randomly generated monsters that automatically put you into the fight screen get annoying when you are trying to spend time figuring out where something is, such as the Moon Folk Village, which I don't think I will ever find! But hey, my characters are almost 60th level.
1933952806|5.0|Darrell does a wonderful job in teaching about the Nikon d7000. I own his book Mastering the Nikon D90 which was my go to book until recently purchasing a d7000. First thing I did was look to see if there was a book \\"Mastering the  Nikon D7000\\" and I'm so glad there is!  I particularly enjoy seeing what settings he uses on his camera and why. I can never get enough of that kind of information presented in such clear way. There are some excellent camera folks on line who just tell you what to do without really explaining why. Darrell doesn't assume we know nothing and just do what he says! Far from it. The book is intelligent, clear and the examples are easy to follow. I also enjoy the assignments scattered though out the book. I like the challenge and the creativity he encourages. Thanks again, Darrell! I love getting to know my d7000 with your help!
B003L77G6A|5.0|The previous season's had no episode guide. So I downloaded some off the internet and made my own. This one does. That's about the only improvement I've seen in the DVDs this season. As far as the series goes, I thought it started a little slow, using sexual content to drive the comedy instead of the character's nature abilities. Overall the season ended well enough leaving us with some good cliffhangers which were quickly resolved in the 5th season opener.

I can see from the trailer that there is some changes from the original book. Seems that Spilberg wanted to give a good idea of the characters of TINTIN and his fellows that showed up on the original books in different locations and editions.   I can't wait to watch the movie, I think it'll be a great event.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|For the 25th anniversary of Phantom Andrew and Cameron did a fully staged concert version of pretty much the whole show at London's Royal Albert Hall complete with minor set piece and fully  costumed with a cast and orchestra of over 200. (More complete then the movie just a like cut here or there NOTHING to really get excited over.) This version is nothing short of incredible. Now fans of Sarah and Michael DON'T KILL ME, please. I saw this in the theater for the live broadcast and was amazed by the performances in this. Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess, who co-starred in the \\"Phantom\\" sequel \\"Love Never Dies\\" in London, reunited for the special production and with amazing chemistry. Having grown up on the OLC recording and owning about a half a dozen others I've never grown to really like the piece outside of the original cast. Maybe it's nostalgia for it or just the way others have sung it but this time I was blown away. Never in my life have I cried at this show until now. Ramin's Music of the Night was like hearing the song for the first time all over again and Sierra's high notes are flawless and clearer then ever Sarah did back in her early days. The odd standout performance for me was of all things Kiera Duffy as 'Carlotta'. She brought a fullness and venerability to the role I never ever thought about and her look go absolute terror during the rehearsals for The Phantom's opera still sticks out in my mind as genius.  The performances in this alone make this for me THE version of phantom.  Visually one should know off the bat that the chandler does not crash down... it is after all just a concert. The staging is mostly done with LED screens which, while not MY preferred thing, are alright. Small set piece are brought on and off and the costumes are all here in their glory. While I hope the LES screens don't make their way into the regular staging they did help to set the mood for the night, but it was hands down the cast and orchestra that makes this astounding.  At the end there is the usual speeches and bringing out of the old cast and Michael and Sarah are there and while Michel doesn't sing Sarah does. She sounded eh.. ok... I wish she would get over her whole singing-with-my-arms-in-front-of-me thing but it was nice as she was backed by four past phantoms.  That all is just sprinkles and dusting on what I hope will be looked back as one of the finest performances of this show ever done.ing.

B004TTMYQG|4.0|This has quickly replaced the stock Calendar app on my devices (especially on my tablet). You can actually have all of your events actually show up on the monthly calendar itself (instead of just colored dots), and quickly change to multi-day (week, two-week, several days) just by swiping across the dates you want to view. It also seems to have more fields available than the stock app as well.All of my Google calendars show up just fine.<br /><br />The widgets are okay. I prefer a cleaner look on my home screen, so the borders and buttons across the bottom keep me from using the widget (I use Executive Assistant instead, since it also displays tasks). If I was only looking for a calendar widget, and not having tasks included, it would be all right.<br /><br />I think the only downside is that there seems to be a delay between syncing with Google. When I make edits in the stock calendar, they show up immediately on Google. With Business Calendar, it seems like it has to wait for my device to go through its next sync cycle before updates are made. The delay isn't bad, and I suspect my device is more to blame than the app itself. I just have to keep that in mind when updating and adding entries to my calendar. The fact that my calendar actually displays useful information now, makes this app a definite keeper. :)

It's strange... your handwriting is almost just like mine.  Thank you for your music, and the love that you put into your music. I can still feel your soul.  I wish I could have met you.  I've never actually met a famous person before.  You were only 25... man... I'm that age now.  I only have two albums, and you had eight that were released AFTER you passed.  It's too bad I can't go to you to ask for advice. I hear your words in your music just like many other artists, and I feel like I know you.  I aim to be such an artist.  Rest in peace my friend.... your spirit will be missed, and I'm sure you're with us. May God bless you, and your family.

B002T9H2MO|5.0|if you like those movies that have quiet overtones with minimal cast (THE WORLD, THE FLESH AND THE DEVIL) then you will enjoy this movie. the movie has a surprisingly good twist in the middle, carrying you through until it explains itself. overall, a simple quiet paced movie that is excellent to watch by yourself while laying on the couch late at night. this movie deserves at least a one time viewing. and it belongs in your collection for when you are in the mood for the genre i just described. buy it.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Clary is in for such a wild ride when she finds that her mother is taken by someone that is more important in her life than she expected. She is also thrown into a new world with new friends. Her instant attraction to Jace and the adventure that they take on to find her mother is a heart racing one.<br /><br />Clary uncovers more truths in this book than you would expect her to, but that only makes wanting to read the second book more enticing. I love her endearing friendship with Simon is my favorite part of the book because you know that he favors her for more than just a friend and you wonder if it will progress to anything more than that.<br /><br />Once Clary teams up with Jace, Isabelle and Alec, things go from bad to worse and eventually her whole world is turned and tortured, just like her soul. Follow Clary's adventure by reading this series.<br /><br />Highly recommended for YA Paranormal lovers.
B001HN6922|3.0|If you haven't seen this movie yet & plan on getting it for your young children, know this.. There is alot of violence & negativity for a \\"G\\" film.   I took my 2-yr-old daughter & 4-yr-old son to see this for their FIRST movie theater experience. My son is obsessed with everything CARS so it was a must-see. The movie itself is not bad, but not nearly as good as the original Cars & most other Disney/Pixar films. However my husband & I both agreed that there was definitely too much violence (guns, explosions, fighting, etc) for this film's intended audience.    Of course, the kids loved it.. But they're not real hard to please! They just love seeing the characters themselves \\"alive\\" onscreen.  Just thought parents might want to beware of the violence content before purchasing Cars 2.
B001FB55Y4|5.0|While this one flew under the radar and isn't one of Guy Ritchie's strongest films, this film is certainly amazing with a fantastic cast (including masterful acting by Tom Wilkinson, Gerard Butler and Mark Strong, as well as great supporting roles by Jeremy Piven, Ludacris and Tom Hardy).  The soundtrack is also amazing, as all soundtracks on Guy Ritchie films are.  There's a great mix of new and old artists and really make the movie what it is.  If you're a fan of movies that will make you laugh and engage you with all the action and intertwining plot lines, THIS is a great choice.    I will recommend the first time you watch it, you have the subtitles on to understand the plot better, but that's pretty much my only warning.
1572814349|5.0|I wasn't sure what kind of deck i should purchase at first, and well i was a little worried about purchasing it online, but over all i must say i am absolutely pleased with it.<br /><br />Fist of it arrived right on time, that was a very big plus. When i opened it i was very pleased with the packaging. The over all presentation and quality is just stunning, I am so happy i made this purchase, and if i should ever need another deck of cards, I will be sure to purchase here again.
B005LY4B0A|1.0|this game is horrible.  not worth buying. they make you get so many stars before you can continue playing, thus making you re-play previous levels just to continue.  also you have to play the level for a solid 5 mins before it will even give you a hint.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|My 5 year Grand Nephew, Ryan, loves Cars.  So, it was a given that we take Ryan to see this movie.  Being the Aunt, I wasn't invited to go, but I have wanted to see the movie.  I pre-ordered it on I-tunes because Ryan asked me. He likes to watch movies on my I-Touch.  I got to watch this on a plane ride home from a trip and LOVED IT!!!  I laughed and smiled and wondered about those who panned it.  It is like watching a James Bond movie, but with cars in the roles.  In many ways it exceeds the first movie for entertainment value.  I have watched the first movie too many times to count and have even gotten my adult friends into the first movie because of Ryan's love of it.  I am sure this movie will take a treasured spot on the tv stand along with the first one.<br /><br />If you loved the characters of the first one, you will love this new adventure.  If you are into spy movies, I am sure you will love it, too.  It is worth seeing by yourself AND with the kids!
B0054N73EY|4.0|For the first time since ONE HOT MINUTE there is JOY in the sound of the band. I'm a huge Frusciante fan, mostly for his contribution in BLOOD SUGAR wich is for me an all-time favorite. But it seems he developed a style so strong and unique that somewhere he got departed from the band's original groove, and dragged the rest of the guys (specially Kiedis) together into his own melodic/depressive madness. After CALIFORNICATION they got completely lost.  In this album the band is sounding much more relaxed and groovy. The lyrics are better; Flea and Chad are sounding great as usual; Kiedis seems to have found the perfect range to his vocals, instead of the exagerated yelling of STADIUM ARCADIUM (wich he couldn't handle) and the moaning of BY THE WAY. I can say he improved his live performance as well (I saw them play here in São Paulo last week, perfect vocals). And Josh is SOLID, although he's sounding too much alike Frusciante... Maybe in time he'll find his own way with the band.  Overall, this is great stuff, only not a 5-star because I think the production is terrible... the guitar and backing vocals are so low that most times its hard to find them. Maybe it's time for the band to move on with another producer as well.

B005CK76ZA|2.0|I have been listening to Nirvana since 92, collecting every thing I could, both official on non-official. My mouth was watering over this release since I now only buy vinyl records...but then I listened to it.  My main problem is with LP 1 (Nevermind Remastered) - This is the worst of it. Compared to my 2009 pressing, the cymbals have been nearly stripped of their presence. The beauty of Dave's crashing has been flattened down. It all sounds more like a badly mixed CD than a high quality vinyl. I thought my ears were playing tricks on me so pulled the remaster off my turntable and threw on my 2009 copy. While the new one made my ears ache, the original drew me right through to the end of a side, like it always does. The new version is devoid of any depth and there are obvious clipping issues. I'm afraid to turn this thing up for fear of that awful overdriven distortion creeping in. Kurt's vocals on parts of Lithium sound especially bad, artificially distorting. I didn't believe it on the first listen, but after comparing to the original there is no mistaking it. I'm am no expert but this does not sound like it is even analog sourced. The 2009 vinyl edition was remastered from the original analog master tapes. Buy that one while you still can.  Aside from this, the track listing shows UME has no idea what a person listening to vinyl records wants. Boombox demos are unnecessary on a audiophile medium, but they took it further and split them across 2 records. Logic would tell you they could have been on one separate LP so you could listen to it once and put it aside, but hey, what do I know? Keep in mind that as someone who owned all the Outcesticide CDs I do appreciate this, the problem is just with the execution. The demos really should have been a bonus download.  For the other material, I'm willing to settle since it's the only way you are going to get this rare material on vinyl. The highlight is actually the last side of the last record. Early versions of Drain You, Something in the Way (loud as hell, in a good way) and the standard Endless Nameless.   All in all, this could have been so much better.
0756404738|5.0|I read the Name Of The Wind and loved it, then read a few reviews about The Wise Man's Fear and wondered if I would like the second book as much. And I absolutely love it! It's great to be back with Kvothe and the gang. Once again the book is hard to put down and the story is amazing. The writing is so well done and has all the elements of humor, suspense and surprise. The characters are fleshed out even more and the plot thickens. I hope Mr. Rothfuss keeps writing for a long, long time. He can take as long as he likes to shape this wonderful story, I never want it to end.
B004IY6API|4.0|Judas Priest's fourth full length studio album Stained Class was released all the way back in 1978 and was the band's first album to feature Les Binks on drums.<br /><br />It may not be the bands heaviest, fastest or most famous album, but the record still contains some of the fan's favourite tracks such as the dynamic opener `Exciter' as well as the powerful building semi-ballad `Beyond The Realms Of Death,' which is often praised for its amazing guitar solo.<br /><br />Listening to Stained Class can sometimes feel almost like studying the early development of the genre, the album contained both a lot of firsts and the perfecting of a lot of key elements for the genre in a concise and effective manner.<br /><br />The Spooky Tooth cover song `Better By You, Better Than Me,' which Priest absolutely make their own for example, seems to find the missing link between classic rock like Kiss with early Heavy Metal. `White Heat, Red Hot' contains some early examples of double kick drum usage in the modern sense. The whole album is full of guitar solos and riffs which would influence bands for years to come.<br /><br />Beyond mere historical value, Stained Class is simply a good record that it is enjoyable to listen to from start to finish. Rob Halford would push his vocal style further in the future, the guitars would become faster and more technical and the songwriting direction would take many twists and turns over the years, but Stained Class remains no less of a good album with its early and pioneering Heavy Metal sound.<br /><br />Highlights include the fantastic Title Track as well as `Saints In Hell,' and the aforementioned `Beyond The Realms Of Death,' all of which are of serious interest to fans of the band.<br /><br />Overall, if you like Judas Priest then Stained Class is something that you want to pick up a copy of at some stage and get an idea of how they sounded back in the seventies, making some of the first pure metal albums free from the influence of The Blues.
B00506NRBS|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this tale of a musician that accidently became the CEO of a multi-millionaire. Good for him - because he only wanted to help out fellow musicians and provided a valuable service to help give independent musicians a voice in a overly commercial marketplace. He focused on service and was very casual about the way he went about it.   There are some excellent tip on how to get started and his struggles to find his place..

B000MTPANQ|5.0|As a veteran of some 520+ reviews - most of which are about quality CD reissues - I bow my head in shame on this one.<br />I'll admit that \\"Live At Massey Hall 1971\\" slipped past my radar somehow. How did I 'not' get to hear this absolute gem?<br /><br />Firstly - as pointed out by other reviewers - the audio quality on this HDCD release is just INCREDIBLE. Clear, warm, present - it's like an ultra high-quality 90's or 00's 'unplugged' performance. Both JOHN NOWLAND and TIM MULLIGAN worked on the Restoration, Transfers and Mastering of the original Analogue tapes and they have produced what has to be a Grammy-winning result.<br /><br />But best of all is the music and Neil Young's performance. With just guitar and piano - the intimacy of the gig is as beautiful as a singer-songwriter concert gets. And of course - there's the date...<br /><br />Recorded in front of a home crowd on 19 January 1971 at Massey Hall in Toronto, Canada  - Young had the brilliance of both the \\"After The Gold Rush\\" and \\"Harvest\\" albums to draw on. And with a smattering of CSYN and Buffalo Springfield tracks thrown in for good measure, the effect is pretty much devastating. After each song - the crowd erupts in genuine pleasure.<br /><br />Then there's the feeling of eavesdropping on a gig that has gone to that magical place of an Artist and Audience engaged in a shared intimacy. When he sings songs that are now part of culture like \\"Old Man\\" (lyrics above) and \\"Heart Of Gold\\" (beautifully blended into \\"A Man Needs A Maid\\") - he is doing so here with a freshness that is thrilling. His vocals are slightly nervous yet beautiful - his ache is real. And he even tries to sell some of the songs to the audience with story-banter in between tunes. Neil Young gets personal - yikes!<br /><br />And as if this isn't enough - someone only went and filmed parts of it. The DVD is gorgeous - concert footage, lyrics, and interviews...wow!<br /><br />We played \\"Live At Massey Hall 1971\\" in-store a few days ago and were deluged at the counter. Most of our customers were unaware of it. And all walked away - both impressed and even moved.<br /><br />A genuinely sensational reissue in the on-going 'Neil Young Archives' series - get this treat into your life as soon as possible...e unaware of it.

B004PR71JC|4.0|I ordered this for my son since we both enjoyed watching the movie so much.  He loves listening to the 'bad birdie' song and the theme song when he can hear the 'babies' singing along! As with any CD- if you listen to it over & over & over again, you can tire of it, but the more upbeat songs are great for in car, and we've turned listening to it into a game where I ask him what part of the movie the music is from; for the songs that are more background music from the movie, his job is to listen for them the next time he watches it. Great fun and a sanity saver!
B005QJU4UG|5.0|I love this show. It is a fresh new idea, not the same old crime scene, mystery as other shows. GREAT Story and excellent actors!
B005BW0TO4|3.0|The reviewer who compared 3 Doors Down's change in music style to Def Leppard hit the nail on the head. This isn't hard rock anymore, it's radio-friendly-pop-rock. Some will like it, but it's just not what I'm looking for.
B004M3GDI4|5.0|I purchased the PIXA 3 in hopes of simplifying my headlamp use camping.I have a Petzl Zipka which I've used for many years as a general purpose light around camp.I have an older,bulkier headlamp with the battery  pack on the back strap-this has worked well when I needed more light.But it was heavy.My new PIXA 3 is comfy to wear,with a die-cast indestructible feel to it.The light swivels and can be aimed just where it's needed.Combined with the 3 mode lighting choices,this light can be set to accomplish any task.A little pricey-but quality pays for itself in the long run.Especially out in the wilderness when you really need your stuff to just work.This is a great all-purpose light.A very happy no regret kind of purchase.

1451629184|5.0|To read this book makes you really see some of the things these sick people can do to another human being.  The fact that this woman has come out of this as articulate, beautiful, normal and giving to others as she has is an amazing story in itself.  I hope someday Ms. Dugard can find a relationship with an understanding man and experience the normal side of a man, woman relationship.  The book is more certainly a heartfelt read.
0439023521|5.0|I ordered these books not knowing what the plot or storyline would lead to.  The book starts out relatively slow setting up the plot and characters.  When Katniss's true personality and character is unveiled the book really starts to take off to nothing I have read before.  I have read Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and many other great series but none compare to this.  I would fall asleep thinking of The Hunger Games, dream of being in The Hunger Games, and then wake up going around telling all of my colleagues and friends about the book.  If you have not read it yet you have to order the book and read it now!  You will not want to put it down
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book was absolutely fantastic. At first glance it appears to be intimidating just based on it's size. Rothfuss will sweep you off your feet and take you into his world in quite short order though. By the end of the book you'll still be wanting more.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Uhm. Well this is a knife sharpener. I have knives that were very dull and now they are very sharp. Very pocket-sized friendly. Don't know what else to say. 5/5 for doing what I want a knife sharpener to do.
B00003CWLF|5.0|I love Anna and the King.  I used to have it in video.  I just recently bought the DVD.  Haven't watched it in several years until now.  I cried again at the end as I always do.  It's so moving, and it's based on a true story. It's great to watch alone or with that special someone.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This device works very well and I am very pleased with it. Referred to friends who too are going to purchase one.Great product.
0671015206|5.0|A great book that stops all your preconceptions of millionaires. Definitely helps you keep your healthy financial habits instead of doing something you think millionaires would do. A great read!
B004P8JPS6|3.0|A disappointing Prequel to the Jack Reacher series.This read like a first in a series not a polished Novel like the past.Maybe Mr. Child is running out of new material because this was not very exciting and certainly not as entertaining as his past works. Mr.Child owes his readers more then this half effort.
B0033B5XCS|5.0|Every thing come out good alll the movies work.Myself I like box sets its better then buying one by one.cuz horror movies never stop with just one when there good like Friday the 13th,Hell raiser,Chucky I think you get the point so yes these is a great buy for your money trust me
B0053TMP24|4.0|First off the Kindle version had more typo's and spelling errors than most of my comments.  That's saying a lot)<br /><br />Second, I have always liked these books cause even though they seemed to have more story coming they still seemed to have an ending.  This one didn't I wouldn't have been surprised at all to have \\"To Be Continued\\" after reading the last line of the book.  I mean, he just cut it off.  Take left step, take r... nope you don't get right step till next book.<br /><br />Also in the book it did feel a little rushed, true WE knew most of the story already since we had Lost Hero but still Mr. Riordan normally tells a fuller story.  This one felt a little more like filler to get Percy caught up and to introduce a couple of other characters.<br /><br />Spoiler<br />Also in the book he broke one of his rules.  You need a God and a demigod to kill a giant.  What god helped Frank and Hazel?<br />Secondly, Leo is Sammy's great grandson?  Is that so he can through in a romantic love triangle or something?  And no it wasn't a surprise at all as soon as Gaea told Hazel that Sammy moved to Texas, and Percy said Sammy looks familiar to him.  Percy just had the dream where he seen Leo and the Argo II.<br />End of spoilers<br /><br />But other than those I thought it was a great book, maybe my expectations were just set really high for this one.  That or maybe the Kindle errors just irked me off that much.
B000001DV2|5.0|This might not be there best CD, but it does have a few good song by them. Their most famous songs from this album are: \\"Let's Get Rocked,\\" \\"Heaven Is\\" and \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad.\\" The linear notes have some good things in it, for example: there is a paragraph of when they recorded this album and pictures of the four at the time. Overall this is a great CD with a great selection of songs too. I would recommend this to any Def Leppard fan who doesn't have this album.
B0055PMJMW|2.0|What exactly happened to you Connelly? I have been your fan for too long and I was never disappointed with your novels until now. This books seems like it has been rushed in finishing, not even bothering to end it well. What a waste of talent.
B00005V6JU|5.0|This is the way romantic moments are made musically and in French, no less. Merci, Henri, pour votre carriere si belle!
B0053TMP24|3.0|Decent book but with serious typos all over the Kindle version.  I was able to read it but the strange line spacing and misspellings were atrocious.  I would expect the publisher to fix them and send us this book again to download.  With that said, I was so happy to have Percy back that I could overlook most of the flaws. The strange plot twist at the end with Leo felt a bit contrived. And the reason for Percy being missing for so long was quite lame, IMHO. But next to Harry Potter, Percy is far and away my favorite hero. Thanks for giving him back to us.
B0043FYT9G|5.0|I must say that as a male listener, I was appreciating the wisdom put forth by a youthful French-Canadian singer who tells it like it is between men and women romantically. And it is even more believable with a duet she has included with a certain Monsieur Julien who agrees with her. Merci, Beatrice Martin aka \\"Coeur de Pirate\\" for reminding us men how we should be careful with the beautiful hearts of women when we love them.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|When I saw the trailer for this movie I pictured a movie like Mighty Ducks, good family film, fun, but a bit cheesy.  Boy was I wrong.  The movie was great!  So many lessons to take away!  Highly recommended.  A good reminder how blessed we truly are.  That even in terrible circumstances, God has a beautiful plan through those painful and confusing times.  Our human time line and perspective is so short (we have an eternity to look forward to - if we know Jesus), we are so narrow focused (typically focus only on self), and we don't trust God enough (he is the creator and father that loves us).  We need more films like this one!  Side note: as a guy I feared that all the girls in swimsuits would be distracting, but it was filmed very tasteful and not at all distracting or suggestive (unlike so many movies that do).
0553260111|5.0|If The Janson Directive has power under the hood, The Bourne Identity has a tail wind that makes a spectator's hat spin.  Think 70 454 Corvette engine, 650+ horsepower, Tilton 3 disc clutch, and HD Racing axles.  This is not a book to read at bedtime if you have to get up early.<br /><br />If you crave adventure stories, you might also try [[ASIN:B004YTI1UY The Golden Catch]], a thriller/adventure novel where the action unfolds in the stormy Aleutian Islands.<br /><br />Roger Weston, author of The Golden Catch
0553801473|2.0|I, too, loved the first three books of the series, then stumbled a bit during A Feast for Crows, due in part to overly gory descriptions that went on for pages. But the story has become totally bogged down in A Dance with Dragons. What happened to the page-turner quality of this series? The characters we once cared about now seem flat and horribly existential. It's like the editors didn't have the guts to cut out boring, superfluous parts that drag down the story line. And they forgot to add some meaning and life back into the main characters. Tyrion is the only character who remains interesting, but his travels (hundreds of pages-worth) are not. This book should have been shortened to about 300 pages, instead of the 959 we're expected to slog through.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love a book that can be laid down to go to the bathroom or eat dinner; one that makes you want to pick it up again very soon. I do feel Ellen missed an opportunity to have more fun with a colonoscopy. Her tale describes the proceedure which, as she said, isn't that bad. Of course not, one is out cold. However, why not expand and discuss the unpleasant prep. That's the hard part. Drink that solution until it comes out at the same temperature as it goes in. In the end (get the humor), this book is a fantastic read. You can just hear Ellen speak as she kids around, often times going way off topic for a brief comment. Wish I could loan you my copy.

B0052TDGQO|5.0|I received Scotty McCreery's first CD today and took the time to listen to every song and read the insert.  What an outstanding production!  It is quite apparent that the songs were written specifically for Scotty - his age and moral strengths come through strongly. It is refreshing to know that when Scotty says he understands where his talent comes from, he really means it!  Only God and parental upbringing could give him that kind of talent accompanied with humility. I love all the songs but particularly the slower ones that highlight his beautiful, deep voice.  The Old King James gave me goosebumps! Dirty Dishes and Back on the Ground are down to earth and beautiful.  Clear as Day is a great song - probably be a Country Music Hit and played non-stop on the radio.  And, I Love You This Big...well, what more can I say?  It is already a huge hit. I pray that Scotty will always stay true to his first love, the LORD Jesus Christ.  I'll be following his music career.

B000ZECQ08|3.0|I purchased the Two-Disc Special Edition of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  It was an awesome movie, that's not the reason for my \\"it's ok\\" 3 stars.  The description says it has subtitles in Spanish, French and English.  Nope, that couldn't be further from the truth.  It's only the French edition.  Subtitles only in French.  Yeah, that isn't going to do me a bit of good.
B004ZNARH4|3.0|I love Pink Floyd and love this Album, but I feel like I got gamed on this one. The thing that really rubs me the wrong way is the audio visual content. I mistakenly thought there would be live video of their 1974 concert tour, not just the films shown on the screen. \\"Screen Films\\", now I get it. Just watch the very short 2003 documentary they include in this and it's obvious they have concert footage from this era. I suppose they will release another box set of the concert footage. Oh, no, my check book can't handle any more of this. For over $100 dollars, they should have included at least a live video of each song on the album. Nothing against \\"Careful with That Axe\\" or \\"Heart of the Sun\\" those were fun, but this so called immersion box set is screaming out for more live concert footage. Screen films, seriously. I'm the chump, I guess. If you really want a good video on Dark Side of the Moon, I'd suggest the Classic Albums DVD for $9.73 at Amazon.  The other thing I was really hoping would be here are more of the studio recording out-takes. Remember in \\"Live at Pompeii\\", when Rick Wright was banging out the chorus for \\"Us and Them\\" on the Piano or when David Gilmour was playing that Kick A** guitar solo in \\"Brain Damage\\". I was hoping that would at least be in the Parson's Mix, but low and behold, no such luck.  Overall, here's what I thought  The new 2011 mix, haven't listened to it and don't care.  The 5.1 version - Epic, changed my life, worth at least the price of the 2003 SACD version. Quad Mix was great also.   1974 Live Recording- Fun but quickly forgettable. Wanted to see the live show not just hear it.  Previously un-released. Will listen to the Alan Parson's mix at least a few more times. Liked that. The other stuff was interesting but not really that good. See above. Wanted alternate recordings and out-takes.  Audio Visual Content - Very Disappointing. EMI should be ashamed about how sparse this was. For the money there should have been two disks of live versions of these songs from 1972, 1973 and 1974. We all know you have it.   But hay, at least I have the marbles.
B005CGI3ZG|4.0|I wanted to give it a 3 1/2 stars but since I cant give stars I gave it a 4.  Why?  The service was great. It took two days to ship and one day to get to me. Much better than some of my other Amazon expiriences. But the DVD's are all just thrown together in this book like case. Half the discs on one side and the other half on the other. If you dont put back the card board piece back in all the DVD's just move around. The way they are being held is just the way to keep them all safe and scratch free. I just started watching it, and it is annoying to have to keep lifting the DVD's I already saw to be able to get to the next one.   The quality of the picture is horrible. I am not done with the first season so I do not know if it is like that with all the seasons, but it seriously looks like I am watching the show in an old style Antena TV with bad reception. They could have put a little effort to digitally master the episodes. While the biggest complain I read about was the music, and yes I do agree it sucks not hearing every song that the show was originally aired with on the DVD, I can understand the licensing issues that came out. Still I feel a little nostalgic listening to all those songs that I used to hear on the radio and now no one knows.   The price is good for what you are getting, which is why I have it the 4 stars. Cant expect more for what I paid, but I wouldnt have minded paying a little more for a better quality video and better casing for all those DVD's.

Listening to this reminded me of when I used to listen to Lou Reed's post Coney Island Baby records - Just waiting for the next song to be better - then all of a sudden it ends - and that's that - no need to listen again (at least Lou Reed used to have at least one classic on every record. Oh well - it's back to listening to Radiohead for me!!!

B000PMLFRA|5.0|Classic Trilogy ~ Version Release History (last 4 versions)<br /><br />1. Special Editions (VHS/LaserDisc 1997)<br />2. DVD Versions (2004, often erroneously referred to as \\"Special Editions\\")<br />3. Original Theatrical Versions (adapted to DVD 2006)<br />4. Blu-Ray Versions (2011)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003ZSJ212 Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />I'm a first-generation Star Wars fan since 1977, having seen the original versions of the original three films in the theater one time each as a child, then falling in love with them all over again on VHS in 1987.  And I've been a huge fan ever since.  The Star Wars Saga is the ultimate epic space opera and film series.<br /><br />This isn't actually a review of the movies most of you reading this will have seen one or more versions of dozens of times, although this review will discuss some of the changes made (and not made) to the films.<br /><br />I actually own the six-film Star Wars Saga blu-ray set linked above, and I reviewed that.  The movie discs in this product are 3 of the same discs from the larger Saga set, so I thought I would edit that review down to only discuss the classic trilogy discs themselves and post it here.  This is meant to be an overview with personal observations and select commentary thrown in.<br /><br />DISC PHYSICAL QUALITIES<br /><br />The discs themselves are heavy-duty, yet smooth and well-coated with scratch resistance - the best available in retail products I've seen.  The discs themselves do not have any images - they are light grey with blue trimmings.  The movie discs (1-6) have the previously used logos of STAR WARS with the episode subtitle underneath, both on top of the episode number in the form of a large Roman numeral.<br /><br />THE FILM DISCS<br /><br />This is as good a place as any to mention that there are two audio commentary tracks for each of the films of blu-ray.  There are the same ones from the previous DVD versions of these films, and then new commentaries compiled from \\"archival interviews with cast and crew\\".  I would expect that the word \\"archival\\" to mean pre-1997, which should be a real treat for all the purists.  I don't enjoy listening to commentaries while watching adventure films, but I will force myself to listen to the new tracks once (as I did for the original DVD commentaries).<br /><br />As I have only had one frame of reference for viewing the blu-ray films, I thought I should first specify what that is, in case my experiences are in any way relative to my equipment and viewing conditions.  This may mean more to you than it does to me.  My blu-ray player is a Sony BDP-S350.  My HD TV is a Sony Bravia KDL-40V4100, a flat-screen LCD with a diagonal of a little over a meter.  My blu-ray player and TV are both almost 3 years old.  My line of vision is exactly 90° to the plane of the TV screen, and my eyes and ears are at a height equal to about 1/3 up from the bottom edge of the screen.  I'm sitting such that the distance of my head to the TV screen is a little more than the width of the Death Star's thermal exhaust port.<br /><br />The Films on Blu-ray<br /><br />All three films sound and look awesome in HD!  I fully appreciate all the pain-staking effort that had to go into improving the resolution of over 6 hours of high-quality sci-fi entertainment, frame-by-frame.  The Millennium Falcon is amazingly detailed, with all of it's charming dents and carbon-scoring.  The Death Stars seem even bigger and more epic due to the incredible level of detail now visible.  I could go on and on, but you're really just going to have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />There is one significant exception in the HD upgrade.  A very logical and fitting artistic choice was made in the rendering of the holograms of characters.  Throughout the films, it looks like the holograms were not upgraded to HD, now looking somewhat pixilated compared to the surrounding \\"reality\\" they are projected into.  This of course is easily explained in-universe as they are just not high-resolution transmissions, and I feel this actually works to improve the illusion of the entire scene seeming real.  The holograms are now an intentional vestige of the analogue age, left behind to honor the origin and evolution of the Star Wars films themselves which began as motion picture projections but have now become the ultra-realistic-looking digital media.  A very nice touch.<br /><br />A significant improvement that the HD upgrade also provides is a solution to a common criticism I have ran into since 1997.  Over the years I have heard many Star Wars fans express that the addition of GC characters and objects into the films seems unrealistic.  Ironically, these fans seem to have no trouble accepting the un-reality of rubber muppet characters, but CG is somehow unacceptable in their vision of the Star Wars universe.  Well, now muppets, rubber masks, human actors and CG characters can all exist in visual harmony together, thanks to the wonders of HD.  The increase in resolution seems to have unified the apparent realities of them all.  Now the real-world elements of the scenes have been \\"raised\\" to the same level of visual reality of the CG elements, resulting in the CG elements seeming to much more naturally blend in with their surroundings.  This adds in a whole new level of visual realism to the films, perhaps being the greatest achievement of these new blu-ray versions of the films.<br /><br />Now I'll go into more detail about some of the blu-ray enhancements and changes specific to each film.  Above, I mentioned how great the Death Stars and the Falcon look.  The asteroid field effects are improved all the way around, and Cloud City looks fantastic.  The upgrade to high definition is more noticeable in the original trilogy and thus strikes me as even more stunning overall.  For the most part, the lightsaber effects are improved and match the prequel effects.<br /><br />However, there are some aspects of some scenes that you can only do so much with without completely new effects.  The squares around the ships flying in front of outer space are no longer visible, but ships flying in front a capital ship still sometimes show a barely noticeable amount of distortion surrounding the smaller ship.  The snowspeeder cockpits viewed from the pilot's point of view are now completely opaque against the Hoth landscape, but you can still just barely see the moon of Endor through Han's head and the cockpit of the shuttle Tyderium.  And some distance backgrounds that were previously just out-of-focus in the original camerawork are now just understandably flat-out blurry in HD.<br /><br />Episode IV: A New Hope<br /><br />Obi-Wan's simulated Krayt Dragon roar (to scare off the Tusken Raiders that had attacked Luke) has been changed yet again.  While I don't understand Lucas' need to change it, I also don't understand the big uproar this insignificant alteration to the film has caused among fans.  A live Krayt Dragon is never seen onscreen anywhere in the film saga.  Who's to say what a fictional off-screen animal should sound like?  I would think Lucas is the only one that would even care.  I certainly don't give a damn what the dragon is supposed to sound like.  The fictional simulation of a never-seen creature's roar only has to convince the fictional Sand People, not us.  You may not like a particular sound effect, but I think the harsh criticisms I have read about this (for any version of the roar) for something so inconsequential are ridiculous.<br /><br />Rocks have been added near the opening of the little cave that R2 is hiding in when Obi-Wan shows up, and the negative criticisms to this are completely unfounded.  It has been spread throughout the internet that the rocks inexplicably \\"disappear\\" when R2 is later shown wheeling towards Obi-Wan and Luke, but the purists that have stated this are totally misinterpreting the scene.  When R2 is coming out of hiding, the shot is from a different angle than the previous view into the cave, and the rocks that had been added to the previous shot would be behind R2 who is obscuring the mouth of the cave.  So how are you supposed to see the added rocks through R2?  There is no discontinuity caused by the added rocks, and I suspect that some purists are misreporting things in an attempt to fuel the fire of their hatred of Lucas and all changes in general.<br /><br />I mean, there nothing wrong with aesthetically disliking the addition of the rocks in the shots they appear in, but it is incorrect to misrepresent a change as creating a new discontinuity in a subsequent shot when it doesn't really do that.  I don't really like the added rocks but I don't dislike them either, because it really has no impact on the scene, just like the variations of Obi-Wan's dragon roars.  The details of these two changes are just go in my \\"Whatever, George\\" file and are then given no more attention.  And some people say Lucas is all OCD about Star Wars!<br /><br />The scene where Luke first turns on his father's lightsaber has been edited more tightly to better conceal the disjointedness that occurred from the original editing of two different takes together to appear as one continuous live action.  I'm pleased with that minor but needed improvement.  And now, Greedo and Han shoot virtually simultaneously (more on Greedo later).<br /><br />The Sequels<br /><br />Both sequels overall look great, but almost all the changes were made to RotJ.  While holograms have been left in a lower resolution, the Force Ghosts have been fully upgraded to HD further differentiating between the two effects.  For the purist muppet-lovers out there, rest easy.  Yoda and Jabba the Hutt remain the original muppets they've always been in the sequels, but even the muppets look better in HD.  And I'll throw in here that contrary to false rumors, Sebastian Shaw's portrayal of Anakin de-masked remains unchanged from the previous version of the film (besides the upgrade of it to HD).<br /><br />Episode VI: Return of the Jedi<br /><br />The static shot of the droids moving up to the blast door to Jabba's palace is now slightly expanded into a wide pan-in to the droids starting with a larger door.  It adds heightened impression of scale to the beginning of this space opera adventure - a nice touch.<br /><br />The \\"thawing out\\" of Han has been slightly altered so the carbonite seems more like it's \\"melting\\" away, an improvement to the original effect.<br /><br />A Dug (the species of Sebulba in TPM) is added walking in an empty space in one shot in the palace (not a close-up), and some people say it looks fake.  I think it looks better than a lot of the rubber aliens in the palace.<br /><br />A few shots of Ewoks show them blinking, and a couple close-ups of Wicket show the details of his eyes, making Ewoks seem more like real animal life-forms and less like midgets in suites.<br /><br />It does seem like a few TIE Fighters were added to the Battle of Endor, another improvement made in the interest of increasing the sense of epic scale.<br /><br />When R2 is blasted in front of the shield generator bunker, I noticed that the electricity effects were enhanced.  My wife noticed that they added some gadgets popping out of R2.  I'll watch for that next time, but since I didn't even notice the new gadgets I doubt I will have any problem with the change.<br /><br />\\"No... Nooo!\\"<br /><br />When Vader is watching Luke getting zapped by the final attack of the Emperor's Sith lightning, Anakin now says \\"No.\\"  Then as he picks up Palpatine, Anakin more loudly says, \\"Nooo!\\"  I've read this described as a \\"scream\\" but that is way overstating it.  And contrary to what is commonly being reported, it is also not quite the extended \\"Noooo!\\" from RotS when Vader finds out that Padme is dead. (That may have been the recording they used as a basis, but if so it was augmented and shortened for this scene in RotJ.)<br /><br />When looking at the complete Star Wars saga, these two additions of the word \\"No\\" do not seem out of place to me at all.  Obi-Wan yelled, \\"Noooo!\\" when he saw his Jedi master get struck down by Darth Maul in Episode I.  Luke yelled, \\"Nooo!\\" when he saw Vader strike down Obi-Wan in Episode IV.  Luke has his mega-no sequence to Vader in Episode V, \\"No... No! That's not true. That's impossible! ... Noooooo! Noo!\\"  It seems that now Anakin in Episode VI is just following in a time-honored tradition among his master and son.  But at the climax of the six-film saga, it's stated at the prevention of the negative outcome.  This broken man who had killed his wife and Jedi master was now sacrificing his life to save their son and destroy the Sith master. My wife, who had made it a game when watching the blu-rays to point out every change to the films she noticed, made no mention of Anakin's new No's.  It seemed so natural and appropriate to her that after seeing the blu-ray once, she thought they had always been there.  Anakin's new No's make perfect sense to me with respect to the entire film saga.<br /><br />I have read criticisms that the new No's were out-of-character for Vader.  Well, it is not Vader who said them!  It was the buried persona of Anakin Skywalker who was emerging back to the surface to conquer Darth Vader.  The titular Jedi who was at that moment returning.  I like Anakin's new No's!<br /><br />STILL UNCORRECTED...<br /><br />I've long ago accepted the fact that I am a severe minority among first generation Star Wars fans.  Many of the fans from our generation like to point out things they would change about the prequels, or changes to the original trilogy they don`t like.  So now that the films are all so close to perfection, I thought I would represent a radical view by going \\"anti-purist\\" and provide my fan-boy list of things in the classic trilogy that in my opinion still need changed or corrected!<br /><br />Episode IV: A New Hope<br /><br />After the droids land on Tatooine, the inside of the escape pod's open hatch that was previously blue is now a slightly more realistic-looking black in the blu-ray.  But later when the stormtroopers search the area, the hatch is still blue.  What, it is a black material than turns blue under the hot suns?  This is minor point but just seems unfinished.<br /><br />Lucas has long stated that the cantina scene was incomplete in the original release.  He ran out of time and money to finish it.  By now he's had decades, no shortage of money, and obviously no qualms about revising his movies.  But one of the two Duros has long alien fingers while the other still has normal human hands.  A little CG fix in a dim background, come on!<br /><br />And in blu-ray it is now more than ever apparent that when Ponda Baba (walrus man) is shown at the bar he has fin-cup hands, instead of the more humanoid hand of the severed arm shown on the floor after Obi-Wan slices it off.  The ANH deleted scenes even have the original shot of the severed fin-cup hand on the floor.  Changing it to more humanoid hand in post-production for the original release was a completely sensible decision because without a humanoid hand it wasn't very clear what was on the floor.  But now, with all this financial success and time, Lucas couldn't just go ahead and fix the previous shots of the alien to also have the five-fingered hands?  A couple minor CG fixes, come on!<br /><br />Also, I really don't see the need for all that blood on the floor by the severed arm.  Putting the humanoid hand with a gun makes it pretty clear what Obi-Wan had cut off.  All the other cases of limbs and heads getting chopped off by lightsabers throughout the rest of the film saga do not show any blood (in fact the severed body parts sometimes also conveniently disappear from view).<br /><br />In watching the blu-ray, I noticed for the first time that Greedo's shot didn't leave the slightest mark on the wall near Han's head.Of course I realize that this problem was created by an alteration to the original scene, and the reversion back to the original would eliminate this oversight.  See below for more on Greedo.<br /><br />In 1976, the remote-control R2 was unreliable and often failed.  So they improvised in some shots where only the top of R2 is visible by having the live actor that played him just hobble along with his own legs, which resulted in R2 appearing to bob up and down while traveling over a flat surface the character would be rolling across in-universe.  Even as a kid I thought that looked ridiculous because R2 just shouldn't move that way.  On blu-ray, the CG R2 in the prequels looks virtually identical to the live ones in the entire saga, so there is really no reason that they couldn't have just corrected the bobbing R2 shots to one moving in a manner consistent with all the other scenes he is shown rolling in.<br /><br />An often pointed out effects problem is the appearance of Skywalker's lightsaber blade on the Falcon.  The fix the blu-ray applied appeared inconsistent in my viewing.  Sometimes it looked consistent with the saber blade's appearance in RotS and TESB, bold and bluish.  But other times it still appears weak and turquoise-tinted.  Why only fix some of the scene and not all?<br /><br />In TESB blu-ray, it looks like R2's blue parts that originally appeared black while in Luke's X-wing have finally been made blue.  But in ANH's Battle of Yavin, there are still shots of R2's blue parts being black.  That should have been cake to fix them all by now.<br /><br />I'm a huge film score music aficionado.  TESB's iconic \\"Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)\\" was based on the \\"Imperial Attack\\" theme from ANH.  There was no longer a need for the original \\"Imperial Attack\\" so it never appeared in the saga outside of ANH.  \\"Imperial March\\" was used in the subsequent five Star Wars films as appropriate.  When the saga is viewed chronologically, the theme appearing significantly in the films taking place before and after ANH makes ANH seem somewhat at a loss without it.  I feel it would be appropriate to edit brief phrases of \\"Imperial March\\" into ANH in two places: When Vader first appears in the film as he enters Leia's starship, and when Vader last appears in the film as he gains control of his TIE fighter and flies away.  Thematically, that would make a lot of sense without altering the musical landscape of ANH as a whole.<br /><br />Episodes V: The Empire Strikes Back<br /><br />It makes perfect sense for walker vehicle motion to be produced with the use of stop-motion photography.  Intuitively, machines moving in that non-organic fashion seems realistic.  But I have always had a problem with the effect of tauntauns' moving.  I do understand that in 1979, claymation was the only way to bring tauntaun's to life, but the choppy motion looks incredibly fake by today's standards, especially on blu-ray.  I still have no problem with the muppet Taun-Tauns used for the close-ups, but for a couple distant shots they should have CGed the tauntaun scenes.<br /><br />It seems to me that the scene where Han rescues Luke on Hoth uses a little short-cut in the upgrade to HD.  The scene is now darker, which of course means less detail is needed.  It actually makes the scene more dramatic because it visually supports Han's dialogue about it getting dark and there not being much time to get the shelter built to save them both from the cold Hoth night.  But there is one shot of Luke laying down in the snow by the dead tauntaun in which the brightest seems to suddenly change.  Is this a glitch from viewing it on my equipment, or a flaw in the blu-ray itself?<br /><br />And in the modern age of ILM, there is no longer any need to depend on the 1979 live-action short sleeve/long sleeve \\"effect\\" to portray Luke with his hand cut off.  Just fix his really long-looking arm with CG.<br /><br />And as great as most of the lightsaber battle looks, Vader's lightsaber still comes across as hot pink in a couple shots.  So the blu-rays almost got all the lightsaber shots fixed in the classic trilogy.  And at the end of TESB when Luke, Leia and the droids are watching the Falcon fly away, R2's blue parts are still black.<br /><br />Episodes VI: Return of the Jedi<br /><br />Like almost everything on the Star Wars blu-rays the surface of the rancor's body looks impressive, but the rancor still seems too slow-mo to really seem that menacing to me.  I'd love it if the Rancor is redone in CG to appear both large and not so slow.<br /><br />When Yoda dies, the blu-ray still uses the archaic original effect of Yoda's blanket fading out with Yoda, while at the same time the blanket without Yoda can be seen fading in (but not exactly the same position) before it falls into the vacuum left by Yoda's passing.  So for a time, two blankets are visible as Yoda fades away.  It should now be easy to fix this transition by simply adding a CG blanket over both of the original blankets, with the CG blanket falling down not unlike the original one did after Yoda is completely gone from the shot.<br /><br />Although it does not appear as much as the Luke's \\"long-sleeve\\" severed arm in TESB, a similar live-action \\"effect\\" was used for Vader/Anakin when Luke cut off his hand.  This is more visible when in the close-up on Anakin after he throws Palpatine into the pit, the forearm that bends like it has a wrist in the middle of it (because in the real world, it does).  But Anakin is a cyborg so maybe his forearm also got broken inside the leather suit?  OK, fine.  But it really stands-out when Luke is dragging Anakin to the shuttle by one hand and one bent forearm that happens to appear just as long as the arm that had the hand cut off.  CG it!<br /><br />Future Revisions to the Films?<br /><br />Based on Lucas' pattern since 1997, the classic films get changed every 7 years so that alone would indicate that we have another revision to the saga coming by 2018.  However, it has been announced that all 6 films will be re-released theatrically in 3D one-at-a-time starting with Episode I in February 2012.  If the 3D films come out at the rate of one per year, the final episode will come out in 2017 which is also the 40th anniversary of the original Star Wars film.  Now that I am seeing commercials for 3D TVs and even 3D smart phones, it seems extremely likely that the films will be re-released in a home 3D format either one-at-a-time or all at once by 2017.  Either way I suspect that I'll need a 3D TV by 2017).  I doubt that Episode I 3D will have any changes from the blu-ray version since it is coming out so soon, but there is plenty of time to put further revisions into the rest of the films, especially the classic trilogy.  I'd be thrilled if they revised anything from my \\"still uncorrected\\" list above!  Lucas won't live forever so I doubt there will be any new versions of the films after the home 3D versions.  So when will Lucas stop revising his films?  My guess is 2017.<br /><br />HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND DIVERGE FROM G-CANON<br /><br />When my wife and I were watching ANH on blu-ray, we watched the Greedo scene and then paused it so my wife could use the restroom.  While she was gone, I went to YouTube and watched the original version of the scene in which Greedo never shot, and I noticed something I had forgotten years ago.  In the original version of the scene, it does not actually show any blaster bolts at all, even from Han.  Han says, \\"Yes, I bet you have!\\" and then it just shows the impact of an attack on Greedo.  It seems obvious that Han had shot, because Han had stealthily drawn his blaster and Greedo got hit with something and died.  But I realized that the original version of the scene actually also allows for the possibility of Greedo also getting off a shot.  And if Greedo had gotten a shot off before or at the same time as Han's, Greedo had obviously missed because Han was fine.  However, besides it being extremely unlikely that Greedo could have possibly even missed Han at point lank range, there was no blast mark anywhere near Han, and as mentioned earlier in this review, there still isn't...<br /><br />Then I went back to the blu-ray and watched the latest version of the scene again.  In this re-viewing, right as Han said, \\"Yes, I bet you have!\\" something wondrous occurred.  I sneezed.  Wha?!  How could that possibly be significant?!  I'll tell you.  As you may realize, it is impossible to keep our eyes open while sneezing.  Even if only closed a split-second, yours eyes will close.  In this case, my eyes were closed during the camera shot of the blaster bolts being fired, and they reopened when Greedo gets blown away.  I was playing the ANH blu-ray, but because of the sneeze, what all I had seen with my eyes was the original version of the film in which no blaster bolts were visible and there was no evidence that Greedo had fired his gun at all.<br /><br />This made me realize that when watching ANH going forward, I could enjoy the overall superior blu-ray version and all I have to do was close my eyes for split second at the right moment, and I personally have restored \\"only Han shoots\\" to my personal \\"viewing\\" of the film!  Then I thought about how silly that sounded, and after we finished watching the movie, that caused me to seriously reexamine my previously self-imposed standard of defining my personal Star Wars canon as including all elements of G-canon appearing on screen in the latest version of the films.<br /><br />I thought back to Lucas' statement that there is a Star Wars multiverse.  There is his universe, the expanded universe of publishing, and there is also each fan's personally-defined universe.  I had already personally defined my world as being expanded from the Lucasverse by diverging from some of Lucas' statements about some off-screen elements of his universe and some of the secondary g-canon elements (novelizations, comic books and radio dramas) that do not appear in the films.  My SW universe has plenty of original elements of my own devising and differing interpretations and explanations of elements not overtly explained or portrayed on-screen, and my universe includes only some elements of the Expanded Universe but far from all.  But I had previously still chosen to not diverge from Lucas' on-screen g-canon (of the latest versions each film), which had included the dramatically inferior Greedo getting a shot off at all.<br /><br />That ultimately lead to my full embracement of Lucas' statement that I am completely free to define canon for my own personal Star Wars universe, even if it contradicts his G-canon.  Since all my non-Greedo-related criticisms of the blu-rays are just visual effects or musical score concerns, I have now officially updated my Star Wars universe to include all the story continuity seen in the blu-rays except that Greedo doesn't fire at all.<br /><br />Contrary to how WEG statted Greedo, I still think that Greedo was not a PC-caliber bounty hunter.  Greedo was just a mook, a two-bit thug.  It is likely that he did have to drink some liquid courage to even get up the nerve to confront Han, and Greedo being intoxicated is still a good explanation for how he could possibly not even notice that Han had drawn his blaster.  It's still not a huge deal to me, but it is undeniably better if Greedo never shot.<br /><br />I may try to rig up a bookmark device in the blu-ray to allow me to skip over the second showing the blaster-bolts for when I first show the movie to my son when he is older.  That way, my son will be able to experience the heightened drama of Han's moral ambiguity, so Han's return to help Luke at the climax will be that much more satisfying.  Then, after the movie is over, I will do what the \\"Parental Guidance\\" rating of the film expects. I will discuss the morality of shooting first, making it clear that Han did not choose to completely become a good guy until the end of the film.  I think this discussion will even work better than Lucas' solution to his concern because it will further emphasize that morality is about choices.  And this goes right along with Anakin's story arc in the saga.  I don't need Lucas' revision to the Greedo scene to do my job as a parent for me.<br /><br />FINAL WORDS<br /><br />You may not agree with all the opinions I expressed throughout this review, but if you are reading this then you must be a Star Wars fan of some kind on some level.  If so, then do yourself a favor and watch the films on blu-ray at least once, even if you have no intention of ever owning them.  You'll see much more than I could possibly ever hope to describe in words.  And if you wish to criticize the blu-ray versions after viewing them, at least you'll then have an educated opinion for doing so.<br /><br />In my first viewing of Star Wars on blu-ray, the rich Star Wars multiverse has deepened in a way I couldn't have even imagined before seeing the films on blu-ray.  While still not perfect, my favorite films have just gotten an incredible amount better.  As impossible as it previously seemed, I'm somehow now even more of a Star Wars fan than I was before.<br /><br />But this blu-ray release has also reminded me that EVERY version of any Star Wars film is awesome!<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free the ask.  If you have also seen the blu-rays and want to comment on them with respect to my review, please also feel free.  May the Force be with you.Of course I realize that this problem was created by an alteration to the original scene, and the reversion back to the original would eliminate this oversight.  See below for more on Greedo.<br /><br />In 1976, the remote-control R2 was unreliable and often failed.  So they improvised in some shots where only the top of R2 is visible by having the live actor that played him just hobble along with his own legs, which resulted in R2 appearing to bob up and down while traveling over a flat surface the character would be rolling across in-universe.  Even as a kid I thought that looked ridiculous because R2 just shouldn't move that way.  On blu-ray, the CG R2 in the prequels looks virtually identical to the live ones in the entire saga, so there is really no reason that they couldn't have just corrected the bobbing R2 shots to one moving in a manner consistent with all the other scenes he is shown rolling in.<br /><br />An often pointed out effects problem is the appearance of Skywalker's lightsaber blade on the Falcon.  The fix the blu-ray applied appeared inconsistent in my viewing.  Sometimes it looked consistent with the saber blade's appearance in RotS and TESB, bold and bluish.  But other times it still appears weak and turquoise-tinted.  Why only fix some of the scene and not all?<br /><br />In TESB blu-ray, it looks like R2's blue parts that originally appeared black while in Luke's X-wing have finally been made blue.  But in ANH's Battle of Yavin, there are still shots of R2's blue parts being black.  That should have been cake to fix them all by now.<br /><br />I'm a huge film score music aficionado.  TESB's iconic \\"Imperial March (Darth Vader's Theme)\\" was based on the \\"Imperial Attack\\" theme from ANH.  There was no longer a need for the original \\"Imperial Attack\\" so it never appeared in the saga outside of ANH.  \\"Imperial March\\" was used in the subsequent five Star Wars films as appropriate.  When the saga is viewed chronologically, the theme appearing significantly in the films taking place before and after ANH makes ANH seem somewhat at a loss without it.  I feel it would be appropriate to edit brief phrases of \\"Imperial March\\" into ANH in two places: When Vader first appears in the film as he enters Leia's starship, and when Vader last appears in the film as he gains control of his TIE fighter and flies away.  Thematically, that would make a lot of sense without altering the musical landscape of ANH as a whole.<br /><br />Episodes V: The Empire Strikes Back<br /><br />It makes perfect sense for walker vehicle motion to be produced with the use of stop-motion photography.  Intuitively, machines moving in that non-organic fashion seems realistic.  But I have always had a problem with the effect of tauntauns' moving.  I do understand that in 1979, claymation was the only way to bring tauntaun's to life, but the choppy motion looks incredibly fake by today's standards, especially on blu-ray.  I still have no problem with the muppet Taun-Tauns used for the close-ups, but for a couple distant shots they should have CGed the tauntaun scenes.<br /><br />It seems to me that the scene where Han rescues Luke on Hoth uses a little short-cut in the upgrade to HD.  The scene is now darker, which of course means less detail is needed.  It actually makes the scene more dramatic because it visually supports Han's dialogue about it getting dark and there not being much time to get the shelter built to save them both from the cold Hoth night.  But there is one shot of Luke laying down in the snow by the dead tauntaun in which the brightest seems to suddenly change.  Is this a glitch from viewing it on my equipment, or a flaw in the blu-ray itself?<br /><br />And in the modern age of ILM, there is no longer any need to depend on the 1979 live-action short sleeve/long sleeve \\"effect\\" to portray Luke with his hand cut off.  Just fix his really long-looking arm with CG.<br /><br />And as great as most of the lightsaber battle looks, Vader's lightsaber still comes across as hot pink in a couple shots.  So the blu-rays almost got all the lightsaber shots fixed in the classic trilogy.  And at the end of TESB when Luke, Leia and the droids are watching the Falcon fly away, R2's blue parts are still black.<br /><br />Episodes VI: Return of the Jedi<br /><br />Like almost everything on the Star Wars blu-rays the surface of the rancor's body looks impressive, but the rancor still seems too slow-mo to really seem that menacing to me.  I'd love it if the Rancor is redone in CG to appear both large and not so slow.<br /><br />When Yoda dies, the blu-ray still uses the archaic original effect of Yoda's blanket fading out with Yoda, while at the same time the blanket without Yoda can be seen fading in (but not exactly the same position) before it falls into the vacuum left by Yoda's passing.  So for a time, two blankets are visible as Yoda fades away.  It should now be easy to fix this transition by simply adding a CG blanket over both of the original blankets, with the CG blanket falling down not unlike the original one did after Yoda is completely gone from the shot.<br /><br />Although it does not appear as much as the Luke's \\"long-sleeve\\" severed arm in TESB, a similar live-action \\"effect\\" was used for Vader/Anakin when Luke cut off his hand.  This is more visible when in the close-up on Anakin after he throws Palpatine into the pit, the forearm that bends like it has a wrist in the middle of it (because in the real world, it does).  But Anakin is a cyborg so maybe his forearm also got broken inside the leather suit?  OK, fine.  But it really stands-out when Luke is dragging Anakin to the shuttle by one hand and one bent forearm that happens to appear just as long as the arm that had the hand cut off.  CG it!<br /><br />Future Revisions to the Films?<br /><br />Based on Lucas' pattern since 1997, the classic films get changed every 7 years so that alone would indicate that we have another revision to thesaga coming by 2018.  However, it has been announced that all 6 films will be re-released theatrically in 3D one-at-a-time starting with Episode I in February 2012.  If the 3D films come out at the rate of one per year, the final episode will come out in 2017 which is also the 40th anniversary of the original Star Wars film.  Now that I am seeing commercials for 3D TVs and even 3D smart phones, it seems extremely likely that the films will be re-released in a home 3D format either one-at-a-time or all at once by 2017.  Either way I suspect that I'll need a 3D TV by 2017).  I doubt that Episode I 3D will have any changes from the blu-ray version since it is coming out so soon, but there is plenty of time to put further revisions into the rest of the films, especially the classic trilogy.  I'd be thrilled if they revised anything from my \\"still uncorrected\\" list above!  Lucas won't live forever so I doubt there will be any new versions of the films after the home 3D versions.  So when will Lucas stop revising his films?  My guess is 2017.<br /><br />HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND DIVERGE FROM G-CANON<br /><br />When my wife and I were watching ANH on blu-ray, we watched the Greedo scene and then paused it so my wife could use the restroom.  While she was gone, I went to YouTube and watched the original version of the scene in which Greedo never shot, and I noticed something I had forgotten years ago.  In the original version of the scene, it does not actually show any blaster bolts at all, even from Han.  Han says, \\"Yes, I bet you have!\\" and then it just shows the impact of an attack on Greedo.  It seems obvious that Han had shot, because Han had stealthily drawn his blaster and Greedo got hit with something and died.  But I realized that the original version of the scene actually also allows for the possibility of Greedo also getting off a shot.  And if Greedo had gotten a shot off before or at the same time as Han's, Greedo had obviously missed because Han was fine.  However, besides it being extremely unlikely that Greedo could have possibly even missed Han at point lank range, there was no blast mark anywhere near Han, and as mentioned earlier in this review, there still isn't...<br /><br />Then I went back to the blu-ray and watched the latest version of the scene again.  In this re-viewing, right as Han said, \\"Yes, I bet you have!\\" something wondrous occurred.  I sneezed.  Wha?!  How could that possibly be significant?!  I'll tell you.  As you may realize, it is impossible to keep our eyes open while sneezing.  Even if only closed a split-second, yours eyes will close.  In this case, my eyes were closed during the camera shot of the blaster bolts being fired, and they reopened when Greedo gets blown away.  I was playing the ANH blu-ray, but because of the sneeze, what all I had seen with my eyes was the original version of the film in which no blaster bolts were visible and there was no evidence that Greedo had fired his gun at all.<br /><br />This made me realize that when watching ANH going forward, I could enjoy the overall superior blu-ray version and all I have to do was close my eyes for split second at the right moment, and I personally have restored \\"only Han shoots\\" to my personal \\"viewing\\" of the film!  Then I thought about how silly that sounded, and after we finished watching the movie, that caused me to seriously reexamine my previously self-imposed standard of defining my personal Star Wars canon as including all elements of G-canon appearing on screen in the latest version of the films.<br /><br />I thought back to Lucas' statement that there is a Star Wars multiverse.  There is his universe, the expanded universe of publishing, and there is also each fan's personally-defined universe.  I had already personally defined my world as being expanded from the Lucasverse by diverging from some of Lucas' statements about some off-screen elements of his universe and some of the secondary g-canon elements (novelizations, comic books and radio dramas) that do not appear in the films.  My SW universe has plenty of original elements of my own devising and differing interpretations and explanations of elements not overtly explained or portrayed on-screen, and my universe includes only some elements of the Expanded Universe but far from all.  But I had previously still chosen to not diverge from Lucas' on-screen g-canon (of the latest versions each film), which had included the dramatically inferior Greedo getting a shot off at all.<br /><br />That ultimately lead to my full embracement of Lucas' statement that I am completely free to define canon for my own personal Star Wars universe, even if it contradicts his G-canon.  Since all my non-Greedo-related criticisms of the blu-rays are just visual effects or musical score concerns, I have now officially updated my Star Wars universe to include all the story continuity seen in the blu-rays except that Greedo doesn't fire at all.<br /><br />Contrary to how WEG statted Greedo, I still think that Greedo was not a PC-caliber bounty hunter.  Greedo was just a mook, a two-bit thug.  It is likely that he did have to drink some liquid courage to even get up the nerve to confront Han, and Greedo being intoxicated is still a good explanation for how he could possibly not even notice that Han had drawn his blaster.  It's still not a huge deal to me, but it is undeniably better if Greedo never shot.<br /><br />I may try to rig up a bookmark device in the blu-ray to allow me to skip over the second showing the blaster-bolts for when I first show the movie to my son when he is older.  That way, my son will be able to experience the heightened drama of Han's moral ambiguity, so Han's return to help Luke at the climax will be that much more satisfying.  Then, after the movie is over, I will do what the \\"Parental Guidance\\" rating of the film expects. I will discuss the morality of shooting first, making it clear that Han did not choose to completely become a good guy until the end of the film.  I think this discussion will even work better than Lucas' solution to his concern because it will further emphasize that morality is about choices.  And this goes right along with Anakin's story arc in the saga.  I don't need Lucas' revision to the Greedo scene to do my job as a parent for me.<br /><br />FINAL WORDS<br /><br />You may not agree with all the opinions I expressed throughout this review, but if you are reading this then you must be a Star Wars fan of some kind on some level.  If so, then do yourself a favor and watch the films on blu-ray at least once, even if you have no intention of ever owning them.

B004MARLJ2|5.0|Strategy game with cute graphics. It takes awhile to remember all the animals' special properties but it's fun to play.  It can be tough too. Have fun.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love playing this game! Its great when your stuck at an airport boring meeting or doctor visit! I would recommend this game to anyone!
0553801473|3.0|Martin has focused on to many minor characters here. I was interested in the first 3 novels which mainly revolved around the characters we came to know. The 4th novel spent more time on characters we were not as interested in, and less on the ones we wanted to lean more about. I am having a difficult time enjoying this novel since I really just want to k now what happened to the Stark family and the Lannisters.
B000002O4S|5.0|Not only did this cd arrive super fast, it was in immaculate shape without the stainless steal jewel case or a flux capacitor. Beautiful sound quality, 0 scratches, 100% awsome. I recommend this album to anyone who wants to get their morning started with a little Huey Lewis (and if your running late...it makes you feel better.), who wants a reason to speed on the road or shopping mall lot, and for those who just want those hard to find songs that fill up meer seconds in the actual movie.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|can't play against iphone uno. Since same company makes the app, you would assume you could. Hopefully get my requested refund.
B001GH63IE|4.0|I own almost every enigma album and singles. Of course a lot like the first album because it is so emotional and sometimes hard to listen to because it is so beautiful. One must see it as Cretu's journey in the musical foundry and spirituality. I think 'Seven Lives Many Faces' is another face of enigma and still as good as he's previous works. Seven Lives Many Faces still is beautiful and sincere.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|not like what I had played on PC, only two levels. no ultimate level. differ from what on ipad. expecting HD version, and more upgrades.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Great sound Quality! I Like all the songs but 1. Three and A Half letters is the only let down for me. Different than the first CD, more polished. They have stretched out more musically. Highlights for me are Big Foot, Dubal Blues, Different Devil, Alright, and Last temptation. Sammy's pipes are in fine shape. Joe is brilliant as always. Mike and Chad seem to really groove in the pocket. Mike's background vocals are spot on. Great CD and a great band. If you like hard bluesy rock this is for you.
1400052181|4.0|Bought this book for daughter's out of town college use.  No negative comments from her, so assume that the product is OK. Buying experience was flawless, though I'd like to be able to use my PayPal account to pay.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|no snively heartwarming feely touchy ballads! no cursing! just good old fashioned rock the way it should be! these guys need to release a live recording!
B004JMRDQE|5.0|This is a great movie if you like Tim Roth and quirky little movies. I am just trying to stop the nagging about doing a review.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I rarely write reviews, only when a product is extremely good or extremely bad.  This MOSHI adapter works great at first, which actually made me think of giving it two stars.  I purchased this item on June 14th and worked great until the Oct 3rd.  At first the sound cut out about every 10 seconds.  I tried to  unplug and plug it back in and BOOM, it was done. Simply doesn't work anymore. I've restarted the computer, used 4 different HDMI cords on two different tvs. Its definitely the adapter.  Trust me and listen to the negative reviews on this site and the MOSHI website about this product, I wish I had.
B004EPYZSU|1.0|I saw big screen names and I am naturally drawn to sci-fi movies.  Watched it on the big screen and I really had to force myself to stay in my seat till the end of the movie hoping for something good, that never showed up.  I think the actors needed some money so they put this silly movie together in a hurry,.. my advise:  do not waste your time and money,.. very  disapointing indeed.
B002I0J5FG|3.0|This review is coming from someone who's never played the originals on the PS2 and is comparing these games to current gen games available.  If you are in a similar boat, perhaps you may find this review helpful because I'm sure this will be thumbed down due to the loyal fans of this game who subscribe to the same group-think.  Objectively, if they were to remove the lens of nostalgia, this game is nothing but average by today's standards.  The graphics are not very good, the gameplay and controls are archaic and frustrating--it is what it is and that is a cleaned up version of PS2 games.  But, you will hear all the arguments for this game, e.g., that this game is different, a thinking man's game if you will, or that it is comparable to art.  Well, too many games have come since that incorporate similar puzzle elements that it really isn't all that different; you will have experienced most of these puzzles if you game frequently.  The art argument really baffles me though. It must have been a pretty game for its time, but I wouldn't put it on a pedestal that it has been lifted upon.  You can expect a different art direction, but don't expect a walk through the Louvre or anything.  The reviews treating it as a Mona Lisa really are a kick in the pants.  In conclusion, I understand that we hold certain memories sacrosanct, so if you're a fan of the game and add 2 stars to this, I won't argue with you.  If you haven't played this before and want to play a retro-game, then by all means try it for yourself.  I've realized that for myself, I'll keep my gaming memories as memories because replaying past games just tarnishes those memories.  I wasn't going to write this review but I just wanted to provide a divergent opinion that others may not want to offer.
B0058WFO06|5.0|It's very rare to find an album, let alone musician whose music is a timeless piece of art and creativity. With the second solo release from Steven Wilson, I am nothing less than impressed with his ability to create and layer sounds that I would never expect, or have ever heard before on an album. He has a unique skill to be able to put emotions in to each chord, and each note that comprises a song and album as a whole. This album can be listened to countless times over and what makes it most special and separates it from most music today is that it can be listened to as a whole without having to skip a song, or just play your favorites. Greatness does not even begin to describe how well put together and what pure genius this album is. Buy it. Enjoy it. Share it with everyone you know!!!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I got a package in the mail recently. I opened it and there was a book, The Help, and a note from my son, Radford; \\"Mom. This book could have been written by you. All of the stories you told me growing up, are in this book. Enjoy. Love, your son, Rad.\\"  Needless to say, he was so so right. I was born at the Jackson Infirmary, Jackson, Mississippi, in 1943.  The book spoke to me all the way through.  My Nanny, aka the maid, was Daisy Bell.  Her niece, Winnie Bell, would fill in when Daisy Bell was not able to come, or when Daisy Bell needed extra help.  I remember sitting on the counter tops watching her baking cakes, pies, and other sweet goodies including the sweet tea, complete with sprigs of mint, she grew in the back yard, and real lemons, cut in the most precise wedges. (To this day, no matter where I am, the lemons have to be that precise wedges. My elder son, Jay, picked up this lemon fettish also.  To this day, I can remember the smell of the REAL vanilla and REAL almond oils that she used in her cooking, and when she dotted these delicious scents behind my ears; and at the time, that truly did smell just as good as a  heavenly scent of the finest of fine and expensive perfumes. My mother always wore Shalimar perfume and I compared Daisy Bell's oils to that.  Unfortunately, I related to the kids who were treated with such hate and verbal abuse by their Mothers, and as was I, comforted by our maid and my Nanny.    Kathryn Stockett's rendition of the South in the 40's, 50's, and 60's, in Jackson, Mississippi, could not have more accurate. I read the book twice, saw the movie twice, and have pre-ordered a DVD for Radford and myself.  Thank you Kathryn.  Sarah Westbrook  saraw7007@att.net
B00479SVBU|5.0|I've had a couple of FM transmitters over the years but they put out so little power, you could hear static.  I thought I'd take another try and bought this Satechi unit after reading lots of reviews.  It's by far the best unit I've ever had and works great in my Mercedes.  I've got a 2000 C280 with the Bose system but without CD.  It was basically only the radio and I wanted to get access to my own music.  This Satechi let's me load up a 16GB SDHD card with music and play it - NO STATIC!  Also, I can hook my Verizon Android phone to it and stream Pandora.  It's really an excellent unit, plays great, and sounds incredible through my built in stereo system.  Excellent product!
0425220931|5.0|I've heard and watched a lot of Victor Wooten's teachings, and after reading just a short bit of this book, I find myself so much more relaxed in my playing.  And the best part is, there's not a lick of music in the book!!  Victor has a great way to explain the basics of music in a way that any musician on any instrument can utilize to improve their playing. If you love to play, but feel stuck, this book is for you.  If you're a very accomplished musician, you'll also glean new insight into how you're playing and how to take it to a new level.  Just after the reading the first couple of chapters, I found myself just focusing on the groove and letting the rest follow.  As a bass player, this is huge. Just be implementing this one aspect, I keep the groove going, even if I'm playing a \\"wrong\\" note.  No one notices a wrong note, but EVERYONE notices a bad or lost groove!!  Make sure this is added to your collection soon!!
0545265355|5.0|My son came home with the first of these books out of the school library. I was hooked immediately, but busy that night so I only got a couple of chapters down before he whisked it away from me the next morning. Obviously I could have that going on during my prime reading time, so I ordered the entire series. I often read his YA books and it great fun to have our little private \\"book club\\", and a series like like this with its deep personal and political plot is one worth sharing together.
B001EN71DG|4.0|Let's get a few things out of the way:  * As of October 2011, there is a BluRay version of the Star Wars series and this is not it.  It is probably better quality but I don't have BluRay and never will.  * This set of the original Trilogy has both versions of the movies: 1) The original version seen in the theater, 2) The remastered versions with new scenes released in the late 1990s.  There are two discs for each movie.  * The movies are in letterbox format so they do not fill up a modern wide screen HD television.  Its a negative if you are one of these over-the-top people whose life is consumed by not getting everything you want all the time.  I gave this four stars only because of the dated letterbox format.  Otherwise, the picture is great and the sound is great.  My kids love it and I love it.  Also, we bought a used version which from this seller seemed brand new and was shrink wrapped.  Nothing but good.
B000M341RI|5.0|The Full Monty is a great story of six unemployed men who are all hoping to find a job to restore their source of income and self-confidence. The idea of stripping to make a buck is hatched by the shifty lead character Gaz, played by Robert Carlyle. This team of amateur strippers all with their own story and unique personalities are believable and entertaining.  Respectable Gerald, played by Tom Wilkinson, masquerades his unemployment by dressing to go to work each day and not telling his wife the truth. This act of deception I can relate to, as I tried it when I was fired from my first job out of high school! This is a warm fantastic film, which has actually inspired a lot of people to strip to support charities. Following the release of this movie in 1997 there was a wave of strip acts all for good causes. After 14-years I still enjoy this film a lot, and I'm sure you will too.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B005HG4C4C|3.0|There is no doubt this is a Dream Theater Album. Yet it is so different from anything that has gone before. For one thing is much lighter than I expected. I really love the vocals on this album probably because Mike P was not there. I would think that this is the best vocals yet on a DT album. There is no doubt that the mucisanship is first class on here. I think the album will grow on me I sure hope so. Like I said it's both good and bad. It has some very fine moments indeed.  Last Mike M is a first class drummer but he's no Mike P,yet I feel the band are happier without him and maybe feel \\"freed\\".
0553328255|5.0|arrived in three days in the exact condition it was described. couldn't ask for more . perfect transaction. thank you
0671449028|4.0|My daughter has had this book since she was a baby and she has now just turned 3 and has handed the book down to my son so it will no doubt be read many, many more times as he gets older. As with many of the Boynton books we own the verse is insanely catchy and my husband, daughter and I can recite quite a few of them without having to actually 'read' the words. This book is fun and engaging, a great, short bedtime story for little ones.
B004LROMSO|4.0|I'm not a big fan of the Camelot legend, and that fact might well be important since I see quite a few reviews from people who are thoroughly dissatisfied with the series. I found the series generally fun and enjoyable. Though the ostensible focus of the series is on the young King Arthur, who ascends to the throne after his father, Uther, is assassinated by Arthur's half-sister, Morgan, the star of this show is Joseph Fiennes, who steals the show with a compelling portrayal of Merlin, the reluctant sorcerer. The basic premise of the first season is Arthur's attempt to establish his reign, primarily by doing good for the people who would be his subjects. In this effort, he exhibits quite a bit of twenty-first-century sensibility, something I can see bothering people.  The central tension throughout the season is provided captivatingly by Eva Green in the role of Morgan, Uther's daughter and Arthur's half-sister. She believes the throne is rightfully hers and plots frequently to claim her right. Arthur, for the most part, naively hopes that he can embrace his sister and the two can be united in their aim to help the people. Jamie Campbell Bower, as Arthur, seemed to me initially miscast, but I must say he grew on me and ultimately seemed effective. Tamsin Egerton, however, as Guinevere, seemed ineffective, not because of anything she does wrong per se but because of the way her character has been re-envisioned with feminist sensibilities that seem greatly misplaced for the period in which this show is set. Then again, I felt the same thing about Rose in [[ASIN:B000VS6R26 Titanic]], and that film seemed to do OK financially.  The look of the show is generally excellent, from Camelot to Castle Pendragon to the countryside settings. It should be noted, though, that this retelling of the legend is hardly a family-friendly affair. The language is coarse at times, the nudity is abundant, and the simulated sexual scenes arise frequently.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is an excellent movie!  My 15 year old grandson wanted it.  He has watched it so many times I think he knows the soundtrack by heart!
B0012909NQ|5.0|It is my understanding that \\"When In Rome\\" was never released on Blu-ray because it wasn't certain the format would take off. I never bought it and never saw it, with the hopes that it would at some point be released on Blu-ray. I do hope there are plans for this soon as it seems the massive stage and set would be perfect for the high definition format. Also, the world ends next year and I'd like to see it before I die.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Ok I am not a Jack Black or Cameron Diaz fan, but I LOVE JUDE LAW AND KATE WINSLET. Jack black was not too bad in it. He played more of a normal, not quite so out there character. Cameron Diaz was bad, but the other three made the movie worth watching.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Used this during a recent trip to Europe for better photo viewing on the iPad (and to clear off the SD cards for more photos).  Worked just fine.  No issues at all.
B001AITH50|5.0|If vampires do exist, Anne Rice knows them. Then she introduced them to the cast and crew of this movie. Brad Pitt is great as Louie. But the winner here is Tom Cruise as Lestat is incredible! If you have read the book, you will not be disappointed in this movie.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Yes, the critics didn't like it. Yes, the bad guys are lame. But I don't care - this movie is fun. My whole family liked it.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|My review may be a little biased as I love all things Harry Potter, but this movie was GREAT! I laughed, I cried, then I laughed and cried more. Great job at keeping to the story and the actors are super comfortable with their characters, but after 7 films they should be.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|As a fan of the first three X-Men movies & Wolverine, I really enjoyed \\"First Class.\\" My only caveat is that this movie, unlike the other X-Men movies, includes strong cruelty (by Nazis) that would not be appropriate for younger teens.

B001TMCBI2|5.0|I struggle with eczema and was curious to see if there was anything in the book about the subject. Couldn't find anything on eczema, but I've been juicing and cutting down on meat, coffee and dairy and it seems to be working.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I am a huge fan of anything really hard.  I recently beat king's bounty (PC) on impossible and regularly play jrpgs a tower defense games.  This game really pushes my mental limits as I attempt to get 3 stars on every darn level.  Props to dev for the AI especially - tough as nails!  I would gladly pay for a sequel :
B0040UAYI4|4.0|Coming from a PC FPS gamer this is hands down the best! Yes it's not perfect, but I honestly think most of problems are from the users settings. I played with mine for about an hour before I found a setting that worked for my style. The software offers four slides for sensitivity plus ever game will have it's own controller sensitivity, so as you can see there's tons of possibilities. I would recommend goggling eagle eye sensitivity and use other players settings that's what I did. I purchase this solely for MW2 (and MW3 once it comes out), and I promise you I'm much better when using my eagle eye.   With a controller I'm usually somewhere in the top 5 after each game, but now I'm almost always in the top 1-2 position with ease.. Usually around 20+ kills 1-7 deaths in MW2 and Black Ops. If you do prefer a mouse and keyboard over controllers this will improve your game just get the settings right and you should be fine.
0553381695|5.0|George R R Martin is one of the most imaginative writers I have ever seen! His books draw you in and you can't get enough! I love the way he describes with out over doing it and continues the flow. I also love how realistic the characters are and hold nothing back! This series is the best I have ever read and has inspired me with my own trilogy I am writing. Anyone who can appreciate an excellently written book will love this series!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book years and years ago, probably 18 or so??  I don't know why it came to mind...perhaps the passing of Steve Jobs and how far we've come technologically.  What I most remember is the sister and her influential blogs that she wrote...they isn't what they were called, but now they are!  I am going to download this book to my Ipad and read it to my daughter.  I remember thinking at the time, wouldn't it be so cool if we could......you get my drift and now it's being done.  I love technology.  Bring on the aliens!
1451629184|3.0|Taken, terrified, tested and triumphant; Dugard shares the details of a traumatic eighteen year experience and her road to taking her life back.  I struggled through the gritty details and take away Dugard's final request, \\"Just Ask Yourself to Care (JAYC).\\"  I hope the book provided some healing for Jaycee and her family.
1416955070|5.0|Unlike many of the reviews that I have read; I have not read any of Cassandra Clare's fan fiction on Harry Potter of Lord of the Rings. As well as I have never read the Harry Potter series because I just couldn't get into them when they became popular. As for the book City of Bones I really enjoyed it and went on to read the other books in The Mortal Instruments series. The thing that first caught my eye about this book was the cover. People always say to not judge a book by its cover but we know we all do. I saw the markings on the man and the city in the background and thought that it would be something interesting and important about the marks. I also like that when looking at it for the first time I saw that it was placed in New York. A setting that was a real place and in a real time. The other thing I picked up on was that there was something about Shadowhunters. Shadowhunters sounded intriguing and mysterious so I wanted to learn more.<br /><br />Here are the basics I thought that people would want to know. My opinion contrary to some was that this was an interesting and great book to read. I really enjoyed that I could relate to the main character Clary in some ways about daily life, love of art, parents, and social problems; but then also have the excitement and escape to the world that we can't see. This book made me think about fantasy in another way as well as the world around me.<br /><br />Characters! I found that the characters were more realistic than most people think. Some have said that no one pointed out and gotten on Clary's case about the things she said to Alec but I found that that is more true to real people. People don't always point out to others about someone's wrong doings or hurtful words. I found that point and case to be totally natural Alec and Carly both realized their mistakes and apologized. Also another point that I have often seen in reviews is that Clary doesn't think that she's pretty until Jace tells her. Which in my opinion is totally natural for a girl who has always considered herself as plain and some what of a tom boy. Especially in this day and age; girls are constantly putting themselves down and thinking there is no way they can look as beautiful as the models and famous people their age. It sometimes takes someone outside of their \\"world\\" to tell them that they look pretty for them to truly see themselves. Also it could mean that she is not a model but is beautiful in Jace's eyes.<br /><br />Now for the basic plot; which everyone is waiting to hear. First it starts out a little slow, introducing the characters and their backgrounds and you get a general feel for their personalities. Though they do change in the beginning you almost just get their essence and the relationships to one another. Then it picks up into a fast paced story that makes it hard to put down. The beginning of this starts when Clary sees something at she should not be able to see one night at a club she often goes to with Simon. Simon is one of her closest friends and does just about everything with him. From there starts a journey that will change her life, her out look on the world around her, and the importance of her family to her. Her mother is taken away and she will suddenly get pulled into a world that she thinks should not exist but some how does. Clary finds that she likes this new way of looking at the world, the people she meets in it, and finds that it either seems familiar or doesn't bother her as much as she thought it should. Then their are the marks that give Shadowhunters powers that she shouldn't be able to see or use but can. From this she knows that things will never go back to the way things were and grows to coup with the huge changes coming her way. On top of that she finds more out about her family and her mother's past. Even though she has never been interested in her past or about where she comes from. She finds that even though she doesn't want to admit it her family means the world to her and she will fight and doing anything in her power to get them back.<br /><br />Lastly I found that I had a new look on mythical creatures. In this book they seem real and have real problems. There are one's that are good and others just don't care what others think of them. Then their are the demons, you don't really get a clear picture of them except that they are from different worlds and don't have souls. Which makes them ok to be killed by the shadow hunters. Finally if you like the first book keep on going to all of the others. The characters grow as the series continues and questions are answered in the other books that you are just dying to know from this book. I really recommend this series especially if you are someone who has a hard time getting into books.t and doing anything in her power to get them back.

B005F6NA56|5.0|I've been listening to this on repeat.  It's got such a different feel from the last album, and I love it just the same.  I've always been a big fan since Let It Die, and I think as her music continues to change I am continually in awe.  Her vocals are achingly beautiful, and carry a sort of ephemeral quality.  Perhaps what strikes me the most is her lyrics, and how they seem to run in synchronicity with my current life experiences.  Or perhaps she's speaking from her own personal experiences, and creating a deeper level at which the listener can truly relate.    METALS. HEAVY. STURDY. RUST. MELD.   Imagery anyone?  I guess thinking about Metals as a whole, definitely gives me that sense of self particularly through relationships.  The emotional weight of another.  The internal conflict.  The overwhelming love and happiness that changes over time, yet can withstand the test of time.  The Beauty.
B0049OSQ18|2.0|I'm disappointed. Their unique mix of different genres of music (Rock, Contemporary, Country and sometimes Medieval) made them my favorite band in the whole world. Here in \\"The King Is Dead\\" you'll find nothing but country songs, except for \\"This Is Why We Fight\\" which feels like a leftover song from a previous album! If you're new to them, please don't give up on them and listen to their \\"Hazards of Love\\" & \\"Castaways and Cutouts\\" albums.
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|I'm reading The Five Love Languages and I find myself impelled to comment on it briefly. Our need and our tradition in the west to dissect and isolate parts from the whole is staggering to me. How can one separate the needs for touch, appreciation, affirmation, helpfulness and time shared, from each other? All of these, in concert with each other, are basic needs of every human being I've ever met.  And, to follow the musical analogy, while I can see the wisdom in recognizing that one instrument may assume the lead, that instrument is incomplete without the entire orchestra behind it. So fine, go ahead and dissect all this. Maybe that is the only way in which the western mind, separated from heart for too long, can ever hope to \\"understand\\" and heal itself. All of the aspects of the human heart discussed in this book can be summed up in one word. This word not only has little to do with mind, logic, rationality, and the winnowing out of one \\"need\\" over another, but may in fact be its antithesis.
B001AW156U|5.0|This works amazingly well. It slipped on very easily, but at the same time I can't imagine them coming off by accident short of chucking the controller at something.  They do an amazing job of improving both the fluidity of control and range of movement on the triggers.  Even if you don't have a game that utilizes pressure sensitivity, it still gives a much more comfortable grip on the triggers, and actually allows the controller to set more symmetrically and conveniently on a flat surface when not in use.  The company I ordered it from, G Dreamer, were extremely great. I accidentally shipped it to the wrong address at first, and they immediately shipped me a second one to the proper address for free. (Expedited I think, since it actually arrived only a couple days later)

0812974611|4.0|Having been to Pompeii I had pictured a city caught completely off guard by the exploding volcano. Harris shows the human reactions and events leading up to the disaster with interesting technical details about the land, technology, laws and culture of the era. I thought I knew a lot about Pompeii but this book has taught me much more.
0385534639|4.0|The first thing that caught me by surprise is how beautifully designed the book is.<br /><br />I flip-flopped between liking and hating the second-person narrative. At first, I enjoyed it as an opener...it really captivated my attention as \\"I\\" wandered through the circus. Then it just got meddlesome. But by the end, I loved how it merged with the overall story, serving a very distinct purpose.<br /><br />The overall plot itself is interesting. Like other reviewers, I found I had to force myself to \\"get into\\" the book during the first half: I was constantly putting the book down, trying again, closing it, opening it hours later. It was hard to get into for reasons I'm not completely aware of. But by the end...wow! Couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I loved the setting more than the plot and the characters. That's why I'm giving this four stars instead of three. I am IN LOVE with the Circus of Dreams, and cannot wait for a film adaptation if only because I am anxious to see this world come to life! What a creative and wondrous place. The Circus of Dreams was my favorite character, in that it was so amazingly constructed and detailed with mind-bending adaptations of what a circus should be.<br /><br />If you are a person who can fall in love with setting and scenery, then you will be taken away by parts of this book like I was. Although characters are very important to me, I was able to overlook all of the flat, overtly-cheesey, boring characters. Not to say there weren't some interesting qualities about all of them--I especially liked Widget's gift, and Tsukiko's tattoo. The elements of magic--or rather, manipulation--were fantastic in its elegance and simultaneous quirkiness, such as Celia's color-shifting gown. All in all, the actual Circus of Dreams made up for the characters due to it being one huge burst of pure brilliance and, well, magic!
1596432594|5.0|Richard Feynman is one of those people I would've loved to meet. A quintessential example of the larger than life scientist -- brilliant and obsessed with science, he thought hard about how to express complicated ideas to students and the public, and had a passion for teaching. But. at the same time he was a character that loved to travel, play bongos, draw, and live life to its fullest. I've read a lot of books by Feynman, and this graphic novel captures the essence of the person I know from his own scientific and biographical writings. And the cartoons were perfect, making the book almost seem like a movie -- and I expect that he would have approved of the graphic format, not unlike his invention of squiggles to represent physical concepts. I have a deep appreciation for graphic depictions of science (the \\"Cartoon Guides to\\" Genetics, Physics, Chemistry; \\"DNA for Beginners\\"; etc) and, although I'm not a physicist, I admit that I'm a science geek. So, I don't know if everyone would appreciate this book as much as I did, but I LOVED it! Pure, unadulterated fun (oh yeah, and you'll probably learn something in the process).

Night Circus is original, magical, beautifully written with an ending that is truly thought provoking.  Go ahead and enter the tent... there is nothing at this Circus that you've ever seen (or read) before.
B0034G4P80|3.0|Hi,<br /><br />This could have been a really good movie. It should have been. But unfortunately, played on a normal telly, during the day its simply too dark to see half the movie,and that really spoiled it for me. I don't like paying good money to see radio.<br /><br />I give it three stars because the half I could see was good. Maybe, if I had the money and had bought a plasma telly, then sat in a dark room at night with the lights off it would have been better.<br /><br />Cheers.
B002PJ4H0I|5.0|This is an outstanding work from a serious scholar of Russian history. I'll be interested to try one of his nonfiction books. The author's knowledge of period details, mindsets, and customs really makes this novel stand out. There are so many fascinating little extras.  My summaries of the sections are deliberately vague, as I think it's essential to be in the dark about where the story is going for best enjoyment. All three of the parts are very nicely tied in with each other by the end of the novel.  Part I: 1916--Sashenka Zeitlin is a willful and reckless 16-year-old. Her father is wealthy and influential, so the family is allowed to live in St. Petersburg rather than in the Pale of Settlement with the other Jews. Sashenka rejects the excesses and debauchery of her Tsarist parents and becomes a Bolshevik spy.  Part II: 1939 Moscow--Sashenka is now married to a Party leader and has two small children. She has remained a loyal Party member for over 20 years and still supports Stalin and the Soviet system. Just when they think the purging and \\"The Terror\\" is over, the arrests and disappearances start up again. This time, Sashenka fears that she and her husband may be targeted.  Part III: 1994 Moscow and London--Katinka, a young historian, is hired in London by Roza Getman to find out what happened to Roza's family in Russia during the years of Stalin's Terror. In the course of her research, Katinka stumbles upon Sashenka's story. This part of the book was what sealed the deal for me on the five-star rating. I could not stop reading. It's a great mystery with the clock running down and old-timers trying to keep their secrets safe.  Overall very well written and engaging. There is some awkwardness here and there where it's clear the author hasn't quite made that transition from nonfiction writer to novelist, but nothing glaring. Mostly just places where the thoughts or dialogue don't sound true to the way normal people think and speak. It doesn't detract from the story. It just stands out now and then.

0525423281|5.0|Oh, you guys...What can I even say? You loved Anna and the French Kiss, right? Of course you did! Everyone did. But I am going to go so far as to say I loved Lola and the Boy Next Door even more! Yeah, I said it. Now let me tell you why.<br /><br />I want to be Lola Nolan when I grow up. She has crazy style and a lot of confidence, even if she doesn't realize it. She's super witty and her internal dialogue made me laugh out loud on many, many occasions. She has an awesome job, an awesome best friend, and two awesome dads. Not to mention the older bad boy boyfriend! What I am trying to say is that Lola is the kind of girl you want to be BFFs with...or maybe you just want to be her. She was completely believable and just a overall fantastic protagonist.<br /><br />Now as you can see from the blurb, hot rocker boyfriend is not the boy next door. No, that title belongs to Cricket Bell. And there lies the problem...Nothing. NOTHING makes me fall for a boy more than him pining after her. That's what made me fall for Cricket even more than St. Clair. Cricket has feelings for Lola and he makes that very clear from the beginning. That made him irresistible! Really I loved everything about him, which is something I couldn't say with St. Clair. Cricket is such an individual. He's completely unique, there are no other swoon-worthy YA boys out there like him. He has his own style and a subtle confidence that makes him absolutely alluring. Plus, he has this boyish charm....sigh....I could just go on and on...<br /><br />One other thing loved about Cricket is that he completely reminded me of my adorable husband when we first met. He had to put a little effort into getting me and he was always very honest like Cricket. So their whole relationship dynamic just spoke to me!<br /><br />You know how sometimes in romance driven novels you get frustrated that the characters don't just get together already!!!? Yeah, I never felt that way during this book. Everything about it was so compelling. I never lost any patience with it. I honestly could have read more. That's how in love with these characters I was!<br /><br />Oh and Anna and St. Clair are in this book a lot! I was so excited by that! Sometimes with companion novels you only get a scene with past characters, if that! But Anna and St. Clair played a big role in the book and that made me fall even more in love with it.<br /><br />I'm going to stop now, because I could probably gush for a few more paragraphs, but I won't bore you. I just want to state that Stephanie Perkins is a master at creating the most unique and believable characters. This book is to die for and my review in no way does it justice. Just read it!.

The higher your expectations the more you will be disappointed. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie at all, it is still really funny, but with all the hype behind this one it fell short of what I was hoping for. The writing was very funny and I did laugh a lot during this movie, but compared to Jennifer Aniston in \\"Horrible Bosses\\", Diaz was not as shocking or over the top as I was hoping for. Jason Segal was great, and Timberlake was actually really funny in this movie as well. Overall, a funny movie that is worth watching, but just make sure you tone down your expectations. I give it a B.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I might.<br /><br />*Also try - Horrible Bosses & School For Scoundrels
0385491026|5.0|wow. okay so this isn't exactly on the same level as handmaid's tale or oryx and crake in regards to thinking books, and took me very little time to read by comparison. but i loved it. absolutely loved it, and it was an entirely different type of novel, and it is going right up there in my top 3 list for atwood novels.  i felt like i could relate to the protagonist on so many levels. i was engrossed. i know one of the main complaints people had about this novel, when there were complaints, was that the 2nd and 3rd parts of the novel felt rushed to them. i think though that perhaps they failed to take note of some of the scientific references made throughout the entire novel, even in the chapter titles. like einstein's theory of relativity.  i was actually able to maintain my composure throughout the entire novel, despite the many parallels i was able to draw against my own life experiences thus far, until the second to last paragraph on the very last page:  \\"This is what I miss Cordelia: not something that's gone, but something that will never happen. Two old women giggling over their tea.\\"  and then i started crying.
B004EPYZPS|3.0|\\"Do not speak of this or else you and your parents will die.\\" When a group of kids set out to film a scene for a movie they want to submit to a contest they witness a train crash. When the man that caused it gives them a warning and people start disappearing they begin to investigate further. This is a difficult movie to review. Much like \\"Cloverfield\\" the preview gives nothing away, and I don't want to ruin anything or give too much away. I will say though that you can really tell that this is a JJ Abrams movie, and Spielberg's ideas are all over this as well. I would have to say that this is a pretty good mix of \\"Cloverfield\\" and \\"Stand By Me\\" with a steadier camera and more tense. The biggest problem with this movie to me is that it was too slow in some parts. Trying to put too much in the movie it takes a lot of repetition and long drawn out exposition scenes which hurt the flow of the movie to me. If they simplified it just a little or had more faith in the viewer it would have been much better then it was. On the other hand this was much much better then I was expecting. Overall, a tense and entertaining thriller that is definitely worth a watch. It was just a few tweaks from being a classic. I give it a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.<br /><br />*Also try - Cloverfield & Skyline
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I bought the blu-ray of this movie several months ago and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good movie in any genre. The blu-ray transfer is vivid and the animation is very detailed and beautiful. Overall it is a very high quality product.<br /><br />For those who saw and enjoyed \\"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\\", this is Hosoda's next masterpiece. For those who are not big anim&eacute; fans, but enjoy the work of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, this movie will more than satisfy them and, no doubt, they will probably want to check out \\"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time\\", if they haven't already.<br /><br />The story of \\"Summer Wars\\" is rich and rewarding. We meet a nerdy young man who is tricked into being her pretend fianc&eacute; by his high school's resident \\"queen bee\\" (most attractive and popular girl). They go to the 90th birthday of the girl's grandmother in Ueda, along with the rest of the Jinouchi family. In the middle of the first night, the boy gets a text message on his mobile phone with a code and a message \\"Solve me\\"....<br />This is where things start getting interesting.<br /><br />I found the film to be a very strong emotional experience. It reminded me of some times in my life with my own family. If there is any message in this film it is this: \\"Never give up on family, even when the going gets rough, especially when the going gets rough.\\"<br /><br />The film may be watched with or without subtitles in the original Japanese language. I am happy with that and it is good to hear the original voices, but I am not an original language chauvinist and the English dub is excellent. Brina Palencia (Natsuki) and J. Michael Tatum (wayward Uncle Wabisuke) are here, as they seem to be everywhere at the moment, (see \\"Spice And Wolf\\" and many other recent anim&eacute; movies and series) and both bring much to their characters, as they always do. Both Japanese and English language versions are fabulous.<br /><br />I will watch this movie again and I will enjoy it again and I think you will too.<br /><br />I eagerly await Mr Hosoda's next movie. I hope it's soon!next movie. I hope it's soon!
B0013TTLDE|3.0|I absolutely love the writing style of Kate Morton and that is the reason for my selection. I also enjoyed the story as far as it took me. However, too many \\"loose ends\\" left me asking too many questions and led for me, to a feeling of incompletion. Ruth's father; what was in the box?; Grace's father... etc. If those few things had been addressed more fully I think I would have given this another star. I was not completely disappointed, however, since I still believe that Ms. Morton is a gifted writer.

B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt is still as important and relevant now as it ever was. This album is diverse and has a nice range from emotional tracks (Rooster) to angst ridden metal grunge tracks (Sickman). The album as a whole has a certain atmosphere that swallows you inside and takes you on a journey. This is probably partially created through the special style of vocal work from Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell where they use multiple vocal takes to create such amazing melodies.  If you like grunge, metal or anything that sounds very dark, you're going to enjoy this. It's an important historical piece of work in music and it's worth listening to it, even if just once. But for me this album will remain a classic that I will always be happy to listen to.

Francine Jay is an authority on the subject and I really enjoyed her advice in this book as well as her other book \\"Joy of Less\\".  I am looking for other books on mimimalism, I just finished two new books that were released this month: [[ASIN:B005O0JNQS Minimalism: Essential Essays]] and [[ASIN:B005SHOBF0 Moneymalism: A Minimalist Money Guide]] -- both were excellent.  Moneymalism couples minimalism and your personal finances, something I really needed help with!  Anyway, I would love to hear other reccommendations from readers who have found other books on minimalism!
B002BGFUPQ|5.0|by far the best fast and the furius out yet even the than the one with the rock not one sappy moment in this whole movie
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Wow, missed the whole season when it was on TV however I got suckered into buying one episode off of XBOX and ended up buying and watching all the episodes in one night! I can't wait for season 2 however I'm not thrilled I have to wait a week for each episode! oh well!
B002BSHWUU|1.0|My box said UK and some other letters I can't remember(UL maybe).The outside of the box was nice but when I took the sleeve off I was immediately disapointed.   The strapes were about 1\\"wide and on top instead of under the CDs like they should be.The box itself was not that great either.As I took the CD's out of the box they were not in order at all,some were put in side ways, and upside down,the white album had no name on it.The white album should have the Beatles in perferated letters I believe and this had nothing on the front,sides,or back.I have a good sniffer and there was no oders or bad smells.  I was worried that if I opened one CD that I would own them all so I e-mailed Amazon and the seller.I'm glad I went through Amazon because I'm pretty sure I'd be out a good chunk O change.
1878424505|2.0|The Four Agreements is a brief little book of commonsensical wisdom, but with barely enough material to really call it a book.  It is more like an extended essay.  For some the perceptions about the four agreements might be revelatory, but for this reader I found it humdrum, and not much different than the wisdom I garnered while listening to my GrandFather's stories.  There is nothing esoteric here, just common sense.
B000002UAR|5.0|1966 Original Sound Recordings made by EMI records LTD.I'm very happy w/this purchase and I didn't have to wait long at all for this CD to come in the mail. I'm no expert when it comes to beatle mania but I wanted to hear what there music sounded like when I was a kid.I think this CD does exactly that.I think when they Remaster music some of the words are lost(??)but don't quote me on that.Nothing on this CD says stereo,I can't find the word stereo any where and the music still sounds so good.   I think I was 5yrs old when my four sisters had friends sleeping over and they caught me spying on there pillow fight,next thing I knew I was being pummeled by a bunch of girls.If only I knew then what I know now,LOL.My sisters and there friends were a bunch of Beatle fans and so these guys bring up some realy good memories.Hope this helps.
B000O599WG|4.0|The Producers/Directors/Producers of this film clearly recognized the preferences of John Wayne fans and gave them exactly what they wanted.  All of the major actors [with the exception of Ricky Nelson] deliver stereotypical performances that they'd perfected over the years.  Wayne is his usual wise-cracking, tough guy, good guy;  Martin is the [almost] hopeless drunk; Walter Brennan is the crippled, cackling old-timer;  Angie Dickinson is the love interest.  Martin and Nelson even get to sing a duet.<br /><br />The acting, with the possible exception of Walter Brennan, isn't stellar.  Ricky Nelson seems to have been added to lend a little more star-power to the movie.  It doesn't work very well.  He looks and sounds very young, even immature, and he over-plays his role as the swaggering, self-confident young gunfighter.  Angie Dickinson's role as the 'love interest' is an unnecessary appendage to the film.  In my opinion, it is a distraction.  Dickinson's acting is artificial.<br /><br />The most original aspect of the film is the tune, 'El Deguello', an anciet Moorish tune adapted by the Spaniards and later the Mexicans.  Generalissimo Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana reportedly played it day and night to the defenders of Alamo.  The tune means 'No Quarter'....No Prisoners will be taken.  The word 'deguello' literally means 'cutthroat'.  The tune is played beautifully by a band in a local cantina and, during the last part of the film, is played almost constantly.  In one memorable scene, the Walter Brennan character, although sitting in the sheriff's office, accompanies the wild tune on his harmonica.  The Wayne character tells Brennan to stop.  'It's gettin' to you?' Brennan cackles.  Of course, that was precisely the point.  The tune was supposed to 'get at' the men of Alamo and it's supposed to get to our boys holed up in the Sheriff's office.  Psychological warfare.
1600610234|4.0|I love how he talks about his methods of developing concept art. It has helped me to redevelop new processes in how i produce my concepts. I have adopted some of how he works and use his methods along with my process to be come a better artist.
1400064627|5.0|I just read this classic for the first time and I will agree it's better than the movie. More detail's are given and I believe that is very important for a story. For anyone seeking what the movie had to offer might be a bit dissapointed, it does take a different path in certain parts of the book. Another thing that I liked about the book is that it's very easy to read.<br />In my opinion it is a cherished classic!
0061452068|5.0|I just finished Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley. Because I am an overly pessimistic individual, I expected to hate the book.<br /><br />I loved the book.<br /><br />I should point out where I read the book, because context is important in this case. I was in Berlin. My hotel room was about 50 meters away from Checkpoint Charlie the central point of the cold war. I was within 2 minutes the remains of a train station where thousands of Jews were sent to their death. I was near the remains of the Berlin wall built to prevent people from escaping communists. Berlin could easily be the mecca of pessimists.<br /><br />Ridley is a very specific optimist: he believes that innovation is an almost unstoppable force. Food and energy shortages? We will invent new ways to produce more food and energy than we need. Effectively, human beings have become better at almost everything: producing goods and food, taking care of each other, learning, sharing and so on.<br /><br />But he is also a pessimist: he believes that if we stop innovation, we suffer. We must constantly out-innovate our problems. We will soon run out of food, energy and breathable air if we keep doing the same thing at a greater scale. Only by inventing drastically better technologies and organizations can we hope to prosper. Innovation is required for our survival. Civilizations eventually collapse, when they become unable to innovate around their problems.<br /><br />But where does innovation comes from? Ridley believes it comes from trade, taken in the broadest sense of the term. Traders are people who carry ideas from people to people. They are like bees in that they allow ideas to have sex...  Traders allow people to specialize and to focus on perfecting ideas. Without trade, we would all need to be self-sufficient. Condemned to self-sufficiency, we would not have time to improve our methods nor share our ideas. Interdependency makes human beings better.<br /><br />How do you get more innovation? Do you have your governments entice researchers like myself to pursue \\"strategic\\" research? Absolutely not. Governments cannot create innovation. Instead, they should limit the wealth they extract from the economy by remaining small. Other institutions like banks should also be kept in check. In effect, central planning, wherever it comes from, should be avoided as it stops innovation in its tracks.<br /><br />Hence, civilization comes in as a result of trade, because it can siphon the newly generated wealth. It wasn't the Jewish traders in the 1930s who drained the wealth out of Germany. With their various enterprises, they were the source of much of the wealth that the state was extracting. They were not the parasites.<br /><br />Ridley does not have much faith in science as a source of innovation. Most innovations comes through tinkering and trading ideas. Science and law come after the fact to codify what was learned. In effect, science may support innovations and inventions, but it is not the causal agent. What you want is trade and the freedom it brings. I share his vision. After all, Russians had top-notch scientists, but they were still unable to innovate in most fields.<br /><br />He sees a cycle, where innovation creates value which is then captured and killed by bureaucrats or obsolete corporations. But innovation always reappears elsewhere. He believes that the best place to be right now is on the Web. One day, governments and corporations will kill Web-based innovations, but by then, a new frontier will have opened.<br /><br />Ridley predicts the fall of corporations and the rise of bottom-up economics where individuals freely assemble to create value. Apple, Google and Facebook will soon collapse, faster than comparable companies a century ago.<br /><br />This book also explains why Germany is at least marginally richer than the United Kingdom even though the United Kingdom won the two last great wars and Germany lost. Winning is overrated. Wealth cannot be put into boxes and piled up. Had you confiscated all the computers from 1970s, you would hold a collection hardly more valuable than a single iPad.<br /><br />(Review originally posted on my blog: &lt;...>)a collection hardly more valuable than a single iPad.    (Review originally posted on my blog: <...>)
B00062IDCO|5.0|I rate this five stars b/c good TV is hard to come by.  The packaging is downright terrible, but I can watch the show in front of my children and father.  I can't do that with any new show, that's for sure.  I love science fiction, and I loved Star Trek.  Voyager was always the most popular one, and needs to be the outline for future series of Star Trek considerations.  It has an organic quality, with impeccable acting.
B004LWZWEC|5.0|If, when you think of AC/DC, you think of Bon Scott as the singer (like I still do),you have to get this one.  No disrespect to Brian Johnson but, this was AC/DC at their peak. The Blu Ray video is fantastic and the DTS sound track sounds awesome!  This is AC/DC in all their youthful sweat and glory!  If you're a post Bon Scott era fan, get it and mourn for what you missed.
B005CMSDKA|3.0|This was a good concept for a film: to have Hanna as some genetically-altered soldier-assassin. But there were so many discrepancies that were unforgivable. The biggest one of these discrepancies is how a girl who can take out a room of people, some with guns, but yet she can't take out a single woman with a little gun? Yeah. Also, the film makes Tom Hollander out to be some bad@$$ when he's not; for a better villain, check out Gary Oldman's Stansfield in [[ASIN:B002O5M4SA L&eacute;on: The Professional (Theatrical and Extended Edition) [Blu-ray]]]. I also extremely dislike Cate Blanchett (who I was looking forward to her being a bad guy so I could hopefully see her demise) so her role in this film was twice as annoying; and Jessica Barden is one of the worst things in the film (just like she was the worst thing about the film [[ASIN:B003UESJDS Tamara Drewe [Blu-ray]]]). Saoirse Ronan did spectacular in carrying this film; she's got a lot of depth in just one facial expression. This movie could have been so much better and while it was OK, it was still a disappointment. There are much better films about assassins out there. This one almost makes the cut but, in the big picture, falls flat.
B003W5C0VM|4.0|If you don't already have this one on DVD, I would highly recommend it.  To many (including me) this is the best of The Stones performances available.  I do have high hopes for the Some Girls era DVD/Bluray coming out later this year.  I already had the DVD version of this but, after seeing \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" Bluray (a big improvement),I decided to get the Bluray edition of this one.  Unfortunately, I don't see a huge improvement in audio or video on this one VS the DVD.  I'm not saying , no improvement, just not a dramatic improvement.  I'm sure it has to do with the original materials they had to work with so, I am not complaining about it.  I am simply making the observation that if you have the DVD version, you might think twice about upgrading.  It is affordably priced so, if you don't have either version, get it.  If you are only familiar with the latter day Stones then by all means, you need it.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Sometimes, you go to see a film and it doesn't leave much of an impression on you. Sometimes it's quite the opposite and you're left to thinking about the film and the story over and over again. \\"Super 8\\" - wunderkind director J.J. Abrams' third feature film (as a director) - is definitely slotted in the latter category! When I first viewed the movie trailer, I instantly thought of Steven Spielberg (who produced the film) meets Stephen King - in the vein of [[ASIN:B00164GDA0 Stand by Me (25th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]]] (published as \\"The Body\\" in [[ASIN:0451167538 Different Seasons (Signet)]]), [[ASIN:0451169514 It]] and [[ASIN:0671024248 Hearts In Atlantis]] (specifically \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\"). After seeing the film, my hunch was correct. If you are a fan of Spielberg's early blockbusters like [[ASIN:B000A2IPP0 E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (Widescreen Edition)]] or [[ASIN:B000VECACG Close Encounters of the Third Kind (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]]], or King's previously mentioned books, then this is the film to go see!<br /><br />What amazed me so much about the story were the characters; they are so likeable and relatable that it makes it easy for the viewer to take these people to heart. The kid actors are all effective and talented, however their characters still don't quite reach [[ASIN:B005KQVDH8 The Goonies [Blu-ray]]] status. Nevertheless, they are realistic and fun - especially the lead, Joe (Joel Courtney), Alice (Elle Fanning), and Charles (Riley Griffiths). Now, let me take a moment here to completely and shamelessly praise actress Elle Fanning. Big sister Dakota Fanning better watch her back because Elle's performance in this is phenomenal! She encapsulates both a boy's first crush as well as that cool, beautiful girl you knew in school, all in one - the kind of girl who talks and you just fall in love with her. Plus, she brings exceptional emotional depth to her character and the film; just watch the scene between Alice and Joe when they are watching film footage of Joe's dead mother - a raw, stirring scene. The heartrending bond that she and Joe have in the film helps the story along to prove that this is more than just some monster flick. As I grow older, I find that my most favorite films are the ones that explore the intricacies of peoples' connectivity and relationships to one another. For all of its special effects and monster hijinks (like in [[ASIN:B0018QCXGY Cloverfield [Blu-ray]]], Abrams borrows from Spielberg's [[ASIN:B0008KLVG4 Jaws (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition)]] in not showing too much of the monster), \\"Super 8\\" focuses on relationships; and it is not in some hokey way, but in a way that imbues the film with a kind of magic. It's that same magic that you feel when you're a kid and the simplest things in life are what matter most - that magic of innocence, growing up, first love, exploring the world, and standing for what you believe in.<br /><br />Most of Spielberg's movies have \\"daddy issues\\" where the father of the main character(s) is either dead or has left, and Abrams slightly shifts this theme with having the daddy made a widow (the always-likeable Kyle Chandler) who is estranged from his son Joe and has issues with the town drunk, also Alice's dad (Ron Eldard). Add in Joe's crush on Alice plus his growing friendship with the other boys (especially his friend, Charles), and there's a well-balanced summer blockbuster. This is not one of those \\"deep meaning\\" movies either; people die ... violently, things blow up (a lot). Considering the other summer releases this year, I believe I'm safe in saying that \\"Super 8\\" is the summer movie of the year! There is something about this film that makes you want it to last a little longer, but it's good it did not because then it would risk being too overdone. It is not the story that you want to last so much as it is a peek into the journey of these characters' lives.<br /><br />An aspect I really despise as a critic is writing (or telling people) about how good a film is and then those people going in with such high expectations and when I ask them how it was, they say, \\"It sucked,\\" or, \\"It was OK, but I didn't see why you thought it was so great.\\" I know what I say is going to set the bar high for most audiences out there, and they might not like it. It doesn't matter. No matter what you say as a critic, you stand by your claim; my claim is that this is one of the best movies of the year. And with \\"Super 8,\\" the proof is in the story, the direction and the acting.e) about how good a film is and then those people going in with such high expectations and when I ask them how it was, they say, \\"It sucked,\\" or, \\"It was OK, but I didn't see why you thought it was so great.\\" I know what I say is going to set the bar high for most audiences out there, and they might not like it.

B0055IU4GM|5.0|Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns is John Hiatt at his best. Great tunes, great words. The variety of the songs and the quality of the music mean this CD is going to be in the player on repeat for a long time.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|The premise of this film is so good that you wonder why any sci-fi screenwriter didn't think of it sooner. Based on the graphic novel by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, this film, directed by Jon Favreau ([[ASIN:B001GAPC1K Iron Man (Two-Disc Ultimate Edition + BD Live) [Blu-ray]]]), takes a 1950s B-movie idea and -- thanks to a great script (adapted by the writers behind TV's \\"Lost\\"), great setting/cinematography, and great acting -- turns out one great summer action flick! The trio of Craig, Ford and Wilde each give spot-on performances. Next to [[ASIN:B004EPYZQ2 Super 8 (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]] and [[ASIN:B005G4TJI4 Transformers: Dark of the Moon (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]], \\"Cowboys\\" is one of the best action films of the summer. The ensemble is superb and all make intriguing characters. Underrated actors Adam Beach, Sam Rockwell and Clancy Brown (whose character gives one of the greatest contemporary explanations of God) shine as I was interested to know their pasts even more. I can't believe I'm going to say this, but, also, in a summer inundated with comic superhero movies, it's refreshing to see a comic adaptation where the hero is anti-hero and doesn't sport tights. The title may sound cheesy but it works (besides, what else could you call this film?). Nevertheless, there were a few parts that didn't work for me; but they were very few and far between. If anything, I just kept thinking while watching this: \\"I can't wait for the next Bond film!\\" Overall, the mix of western and sci-fi works well and I'm glad someone finally put it to film. On an end note, if you are a big fan of mixing westerns with sci-fi, definitely check out [[ASIN:B001EN71CW Firefly: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]]] on DVD/Netflix! It might not have aliens, but you'll be happy you checked it out! Shiny!
031603438X|5.0|What can I say - I really enjoyed this long book.  A lot of photos and was shocked by the detail of Keith's early life as England rebuilt very, very slowly from WWII extensive bombing.  Plenty in here about Mick and their relationship.<br /><br />The book is a perfect example of how drugs, sex, and rock & roll failed the baby boomers and is responsible in part for the failing of the overspent BB generation and the massive worldwide debt crisis of 2011.
B0055IU4GM|3.0|This is another great release from JH.  Great songs.  The only negative:  the production has the volume cranked up!!  My pair of Klipsch speakers and Denon receiver even dislike the production.  I have to turn the bass knob down to minimum in order to listen to this album.  I still consider the Open Road a better album.
B000SINT52|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED MICHAEL'S MOVIE.  THE CONDITION OF THE DVD WAS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE.  IT ARRIVED EARLY.  THERE WERE NO PPROBLEMS IN WATCHING IT.  I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE.
B002WCLG3Y|5.0|Both my brother and I loved watching these stories. We enjoy all the Halo games, and even have some books. We both enjoy anime, him more-so than myself. We enjoyed the way the stories played out. The first two are a good background to Halo and it is nice to see it animated and narrated by Cortana. And it all comes to a close with a CGI rendered episode, which is super awesome. We enjoyed it very much. I can't see how a Halo fan and anime junkie could not like this DVD. Excellent $10 purchase.
B0057GYOA4|5.0|One of the greatest albums of all time. Remastered for better sound quality. Just buy it, you know you want to! Its NIRVANA, the last 100% amazing band to come to the mainstream. Yes music has sucked for that long. Time to take a trip back in time to the days nirvana, alice in chains, pearl jam, stone temple pilots, smashing pumpkins and other 90's greats owned the airwaves! Here we are now, entertain us!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I love this series! Rick Riordan is brillant and does an amazing job looking up real historical facts and mixing them into a fantastic, action packed, cant put the books down, series! I think all of the characters really make the story and i would recommend everyone to read all of the percy jackson books. i wish the next book would hurry and get here!
B005E7AOHI|4.0|Great album Les Claypool and primus are still amazing after all these years. Tragedy's a comin' stands out as the best song on the album to me. but the rest are just as great.
0812550706|5.0|I love this book, but I see two flaws in it.  One, perhaps I'm mistaken about the target audience of this book, but I don't think it would be great for younger children.  The book is light on description--which is fine for an older audience.  Two, some of the major characters have bland personalities (Graff and Mazer).    Other than that, everything is great.  The pace is great; barely any scenes drag on longer than need be.  The dialogue is some of the best that I've ever read.  And, ultimately, the story is so meaningful and thought provoking that I'd recommend it to anyone.
B005K2KCPG|5.0|I am reviewing the MP3 download because I no longer have a use for those bright, shiny things (discs). There are plenty of song by song reviews on this \\"album\\" so I will tell you straight up; get this if you love good ol' rock 'n roll. There are no surprises and nothing controversial.   People, enough with the whining about wasted talent, sexual or juvenile lyrics; this is rock and roll - get over it. You know what you get with Sammy (read his book). He's been doing the same thing since the '70's with Montrose and still sings Bad Motor Scooter, his first hit song. If VH ever puts out a new album, then will y'all complain about Dave's juvenile and meaningless songs? We know what we get with these guys and I embrace it. As Dennis Green said, \\"They are who we thought they were.\\" You know, sometimes you just want to jam.  Joe Satriani is absolutely incredible and brings a broad scope of musicality to the songs. He has so many styles in his arsenal and never seems to duplicate his music. If I didn't know that Satch wrote the music and played the guitar parts, then I would never guess it's him. In some parts, the guitar will remind you of EVH - the dive bombs, hammering, and some heavy rhythms. I am sure a conscious effort was made to avoid VH comparisons on the 1st album. Who cares, Joe is Joe, Eddie is Eddie, and Vai is better than both put together.   My favorite part of this band is the rhythm section: Mike Anthony and Chad Smith. These guys are rock solid and their grooves make you want to dance. Mike flourishes in this band having no trouble keeping up with Satriani. Make no mistake, we're not talking about Vai and Sheehan, but multiple levels above Anthony's VH days.   Chad lays down some heavy beats that anchor this band's sound - just like a good drummer should. I remember some sort of accident with Chad on their first tour and the band delayed the tour until Chad healed. At the time, I thought that was a nice gesture from his band mates. The real reason is the guys knew the band is not the same without Chad. Just like Rush would never be the same without Neil Peart.   At the end of the day, this album is not Van Hagar. No, it's a stronger, tighter, and more diverse culmination of rockers having fun for a change. Take a page from their book, buy the CD or download the $7 MP3. Mix up some Cabo 'ritas, sit back and enjoy.
0385534639|2.0|While The Night Circus is highly imaginative and interesting at times, my overall impression of the book was unfavorable.  The dialogue was unnatural to the point that it was sometimes painful to read.  Other than that, the writing was pretty good.  However, the story in general was subpar at best.  So, all things considered, I wish that I hadn't invested my time in reading this story.
B00466HM28|5.0|I got this for $75. A real great first keyboard for messing around in digital audio workstations. The pads take some use to de-stiffen. The 8 knobs provide a great amount of control. The keys are a little stiff, probably the only downside I can find to this controller at the moment. If you are an amateur, this is an AWESOME entry-level midi controller.
0439023521|4.0|I was certain that I wouldn't like this book before I started reading it.  Friends of mine had given me the basic idea of the plot, and I thought it would be terrible.  I saw how popular this trilogy had become and assumed it was just another Twilight.  I was wrong.  Although I wouldn't say that the series is as good as Harry Potter, I think it's a fair comparison.  I think the story is just as excellent; I think it's every bit as memorable.  I think the writing is better, but the characters just don't compare.  J. k. Rowling had a way with creating characters that I've never seen matched and that's where I think the Harry Potter series has the slight edge.  However, Katnis Everdeen has become one of my all time favorite characters from a book, so I'm not saying that the characters are bad.  The main problem that I had that kept me from really loving this series was that there are so many physically incomprehensible things that happen over the course of the story that I could not overlook.  Overall, though, my opinion is very favorable.

1449389627|5.0|The myths of innovation was thought-provoking and honest, which was refreshing.  I really liked his separate \\"annotated\\" and \\"ranked\\" bibliographies; it was the cherry on top of a well organized and interesting book.  I have struggled to create a few innovations in my own field, and I could certainly relate to his many insights regarding the challenges and rewards of innovation.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Such a shame it only has one season. Imagine if ST:TNG was only one season.  Such a loss to have this show pulled before its time.
B005NA3B8U|4.0|Love the game. Graphics and all are good. Maybe if there was a section to the left or right on the screen for your finger it would help.  That'd my only complaint us the blind sour that wipes ya our and pisses ya off more often than tolerable..
B004G6009U|5.0|Got this one for my mother and she and my sister loved the movie. Both of them were cracking up when I got home from work. Each of them simutaneously tried to tell me about the movie without laughing, but couldn't do it. I have yet to watch it, but if it got the people in my house interested then it must be good. Those ppl are hard to please.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|i cannot open it up after the up every time i click on icon it does nothing.  tried to re install it and still doesnt work
B002ZG993Q|5.0|This is not \\"Oceans 11\\" or any such thing.  It is a serious, suspenseful film and a very moral film.  A film about a fall from grace.    Superb performances all the way around.  We don't expect this sort of film from Clooney so some looking for light-hearted fare  will be disappointed.
B0011UBDTK|2.0|Should have read reviews before purchase. All the discs I've tried to watch skip at different times.  Extremely poor quality-
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Thor is easily Marvel's Best Comic Superhero Movie yet.  The 3D features are only so-so.  You can get the Blu-ray of this movie and be satisfied.  I definitely recommend Hi-Def.  The reason Thor is Marvel's best is the challenge of telling a compelling story about Gods bouncing from dimension or realm to realm and weaving in a reason to care for a self centered thug warrior (Thor) while also seeing his drastic change to a protector.  It isn't the visual effects that propels Thor as a movie, but the story behind the movie.  I could and have watched this movie many times (in 3D, Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy).  It is worth the investment.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|These are not my favourite movies by a long shot and don't think I would have bothered or it even to have crossed my mind to have replace these if it wasn't for the price but certainly wouldn't buy them if I really didn't think the films were ok , unlike some reviewers who seemed to have had a gun pointed at there heads and forced them to purchase a film they really hate and despise then moan endlessly about it...Unless they didn't buy them and make out that they did just so they can complain to a larger audience.      For the prise I feel as though I've bought the bargain of the century and not going to moan to have replaced them which back in the day would have cost nearly that per film on DVD...And probably more on VHS !
B005HSL626|1.0|my son was playing this last night. then a adult ad popped up. 5 star game but can only give it one star due to adult ads.
B004WESFZW|5.0|If one were to believe the promotional spots I personally saw for The Adjustment Bureau, you'd get the idea that this was counterpart to The Source Code, a sci-fi thriller of sorts with a little Bourne thrown in.  One would be wrong then.<br /><br />I didn't run to the theater to see either this or the Source Code not that they didnt look appealing in various ways, but neither gave me the impression that any new ground was being broken, and thus, it could wait until Blu-ray.  I was wrong then.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best movies I've seen all year, and again, it you had warned me it was essentially a slightly-theological romantic-actioner, I'd probably have skipped it.  What the movie has is strong, believeable acting, effects that don't overshadow the plot, a plot that is thought provoking and original, well written AND delivered dialogue, and a certain \\"heart\\", if you will, that most movies these days are lacking.<br /><br />Damon's done a lot of work up to this point in his career, and Matt Damon purists might cry foul, but I think this is one of his strongest movies yet.  When the actor and the character flow easily together, like they do in this film, there is a genuine quality that brings this performance easily to the top of the list.  Strong lines, coupled with a tangible chemistry between he and his supporting actors (most notably Emily Blunt, whose time on screen with Damon reminds me of Clooney and Lopez in Out of Sight in its believeability), make an already impressive career even stronger.  You root for Damon in this film because he shows his connection with Blunt, with his best-friend/campaign manager, with the Bureau Agents.  His everyman-vibe has never been more \\"real\\", and never been more likable.<br /><br />The movie moves at a quick pace, and says what it came to say in just over 90 minutes, which is a rare accomplishment in its own right.  I can't say enough good things about this film, and if, like me, you dismissed it for something it wasn't, go rent it tonight - it may turn into a permanent addition to your collection.may turn into a permanent addition to your collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As usual, I read other readers reviews & a sample before I bought this book. I'm not the intended reading audience by a long shot, but have always been an avid reader.   I read it in just a couple of days and would have finished faster if I didn't need to sleep, eat, etc. I couldn't put it down. The story is fast moving and you can't wait to read what happens next. Suzanne Collins makes it all seem real. You can picture the environment, people, events.... She has an amazing use of words.  Be warned that this is a story about children forced to kill other children. It can be disturbing. I do recommend reading reviews and a sample to be sure it's something you'll be comfortable reading.  Even though my children are now grown, I'm going to suggest they read it. It'll also be one I recommend to my grandson when he's old enough in a couple years.  Read it. You'll be ordering the second book right away too.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|This movie is the kind that must be watched a couple of times to really grasp the content.  The movie is about the life, work, and love and pain of a tortured artist.  The movie is a testament to the style of Frida's art, and portrays her life very much through pieces of her own art, some of which has been adapted to fit the motion picture format.  I have seen this movie at least 10 times and am excited to watch it again.  It is visually stunning and has excellent music. The actors are playing the best roles of their lives. It is not a light-hearted movie by any means, but will have you laughing and falling in love with the characters.
B004WR125O|5.0|Excellent product, does exactly what it's supposed to - connect to home network.  No issues noted and never drops connection.

B0032UYFA6|5.0|The third season continues the gripping story line set up in the first two seasons.  Every episode brings a new twist you didn't see coming.  Some of the strongest writing on TV today.
0439023513|2.0|Katniss was such an intense personality in the first two books but Mockingjay really fell short and did a disservice of her character.  She became a tool and any free will she demonstrated seemed whiny and for her own needs.  It was very tiresome to read over and over how everything was her fault...the rebels, the deaths, Peeta's problems; the whole worlds problems are all her fault.  It reminded me of Jean Auels constant repitition of prehistoric flora and fauna. I quit admiring her character halfway through.  Just read The Hunger Games and stop there.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|This film drags in a few spots but its worth the waiting. This sequel has the most amazing effects of all of the Transformers. Plus it has a great storyline.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I enjoyed watching Scotty throughout his Idol journey. He is so genuine and real. Clear As Day is too. I listened to it several times today and love it! Scotty did a great job choosing songs that fit him. It's fast becoming a favorite of mine!
B005ISQEF4|4.0|I was really surprised that a lot of critics gave this film bad reviews. I think that it is Joseph Gorden Levitt's most unique character he has ever played. Definitely check this film out.
0783815484|5.0|Excellent book. I ordered for my daughter, because I read it when I was a little girl and it became one of my favorite books until today!!! She loved it!!
B005H9B44A|5.0|Dont get me wrong, Marvel done really good with Iron Man. But this is up there with my favorite comic book films except DC's The Dark Knight franchise. Great storyline and spectacular effects. And Natalie Portman is so so fine in this. Definite watch for Marvel fans.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Got to me in the two days it said it would! Product was new and looked great. I am very happy with the experience.
0525423281|4.0|I adored Perkins' first novel, ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS. LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR was dissimilar to ANNA,and it was one of the best things about the book. I loved the new setting, diverse characters, the sweet, but flawed romance between Lola and her boyfriend, and then with the boy next door. This book will make your heart swell, make you laugh out loud, and wish you knew those characters in real life. A Fantastic read!
B000000OR9|5.0|Back in the 80's, I remember discovering John Sykes in Tygers, and thinking \\"good god, now that's a guitar hero\\". I never heard the Thin Lizzy stuff at the time, but was into the Whitesnake the moment John joined. I remember picking up that album and being very disappointed and confused, only to learn he hadn't actually played on it (i have the UK import). Cheated by Coverdale for the first time.<br /><br />The videos for the Slide It In album set the stage for literally the greatest UK rock band since Led Zep; only updated, better looking, faster guitar playing, crunchier riffing. When 1987 came out, it was everything I had every hoped and thought Sykes could do; simply Perfect album. But before I could even buy a ticket, pictures of the lineup came out, and no Sykes. Cheated by Coverdale for the second time. At that point, I felt the greatest guitarist in the greatest band, had been buried forever. Every song but one, STUNNING solos and riffs.<br /><br />After that disappointment, I turned to other guitar players, and lost track of John. Somewhere in the 00's I picked up Blue Murder due to an internet search on Sykes. BLOWN AWAY. I couldn't believe that at the height of the era, AFTER 1987, this had been moved to a bottom shelf. Singing better than Coverdale, and writing songs and solos that were just great, it seemed that the time period - late 80's/early 90's disenchantment with melodic metal again cost Sykes the recognition he deserved. Personally, being on the same label as Whitesnake who'd just sold 10 million records on John's hooks, might not have been the best move. I have to think Coverdale had some influence on what happened to John Sykes at a label he was the top act on. Cheated by Coverdale for the Last Time!<br /><br />This album needs to be heard if you haven't had the pleasure, pick it up. nuff said.
B005EXA8LY|5.0|Yet another treasure from master craftsman Steve Wilson. Grace For Drowning takes you in new directions from Steve's previous works but is so incredibly enjoyable and perfect for those times when you feel like sitting in your favorite listening chair with the lights down low. Bravo, Steve.
B004TB6GUY|5.0|I have to admit, I hadn't really listened to Zakk since the 80's stint in Ozzy. I picked up one of the early bls records in 2004, and was blown away. Like Buckethead Zakk is extremely prolific, but unlike other guitarists, he can write great songs and sing. The nearest comparison to his superlative writing and playing skills in the rock world would be the near extinct output of John Sykes. The thing you can feel in Zakk's records is the passion and purpose, nothing is done half-assed or to fill out a record. Killer wah solo on 'Can't Find My Way Home' as well.<br /><br />Now to the album. Much like book of shadows, this is a more mellow Zakk, but again, the songs are deeply hearfelt covers, and again just amazing solos. the solo on overlord nearly tore my head off; and personally I think it's his best solo. PERIOD. Piano work is great as well, just very suitable to the compositions and his voice. Junior Eyes is another great cover. The particular style of these Zakk albums is hard to stratify, just due to the wellblended level of influences. Not as complex as Zeppelin, but not as simple as the Who.<br /><br />Definitely a rock album worth owning
B005DZMODI|4.0|The CD is really good audio quality, need a hi res version though.  The music is wonderful, rich, playful and artfully played through the musician's hearts and instruments.  Each of the players are the top of the order with their respective instruments, and show it, what harmony of attitude and humility!  The DVD is good-brings you into the environment, and obviously the musicians are enjoying each other's company greatly.  The quality of video production is not great, choppy, poorly edited/recorded, not following soloists etc, but gives you a great perspective of the concert and musician interaction and skills.  I would love to have attended the concert, but this is the next best thing, overall, a really great buy.
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|After hearing Susan's voice on Midnight in Harlem I had to have this album . Very soothing blues type of music . Very easy listening . We saw one of her guitars last month at the Rock Hall .
B0052UZIFA|2.0|My only complaint is that I have had to restart the game 3 times after completing it.  This last time, I was on 5-8 (second play through needing only Half Life achievement) when I received a phone call.  I went back to the game and everything was erased.  I can either start over again... or wait for an update that hopefully fixes this.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|Since most of the reviews on this said to just forget the screen protector, that's exactly what I did -- I like the crystal-clear iPhone screen anyway. This case is excellent. I only got it earlier today, so I can't really give a review of durability yet, but I'm no stranger to TPU and I've never had a problem with it. This fits the iPhone perfectly and gives easy access to everything you need. Because of the perfect fit, it s pretty difficult to get onto the phone, but since I don't see myself taking it off that often, this isn't an issue for me.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Just a moment to say my imput of this item, first I was surpirsed on the price, even lower then most I have seen, but just a few days (i think) prior to shiping I get a message of the price reduction. WOW very nice, anyway, I am very content of the product of my purchase. Dont think the orginal episodes 4 through 6 were in the set, but it is what it is. I am still content. Hope to see others very soon. Unfortunaly I am in the location where I most likely cant recive great items like these, for about a year. thanks for reading.  UPDATE: JUST RECENTLY HAD THE OPPERTUNITY TO HEAR THE SOUND QUALITY ON MY TUNER. ALL I CAN SAY IS IF YOU CAN SET IT UP THE SOUND THIS WAY, YOU WILL FEEL LIKE YOU ARE THERE. THIS IS TOTALY AWESOME!!!! I HAD TO TURN THE SOUND DOWN AT TIME DUE TO WHERE I LIVE. (US ARMY OVERSEAS AT PRESNT) BUT WOW!!! IM VERY MUCH BLOWN AWAY. THANK YOU AGAIN AMAZON FOR THE BEST DEAL THAT I HAVE EXPERENCED. LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE GREAT DEALS.

0439023513|5.0|The best action-packed stories are rare and hard to come by, but when I read the first few pages of Mockingjay I knew it was a rarity.  Mockingjay is such a rare book because it is full of suspense, action, love and anger all at the same time.  At the end of nearly every chapter, Katniss and Peeta, the main characters of the book, are in a life-risking position. You'll always be hungry to learn more as the problems get worse and worse throughout the book. Ever since Katniss and Peeta entered the Hunger Games to compete to the death for eternal glory, the districts want to rebel against the Capitol. Katniss and the resistance face President Snow in the most dangerous battle of all. Peeta finds himself in grave danger. Katniss is torn apart by her love for Peeta, who she only knows from the Hunger Games, and Gale, who she's known since she was twelve and is like a brother to her. Some of President Snow's most deadly secrets are revealed as Katniss and the resistance continue to fight. Will Peeta be rescued in time? Will the dangerous President Snow be destroyed?  Will the bloody Hunger Games finally be over? Read the book to find out.    Ella age 11
0061784788|3.0|This is the first Rollins book I've been able to get through in quite a while but it was a chore. The whole premise of the book was silly and so obvious that he's hoping for a movie deal. The dialog is often so unnatural that it is laughable. I guess I bought it because I love the desert southwest and archaeological mysteries and based on other reviews this sounded like it would fit that niche but his combining present day nano technology with the mystery of what happened to the Anasazi was quite a stretch! Near the end I think his timeline begins to unravel in his effort to build excitement but that's probably being nit-picky. I would also take issue with some of his early historical dates. All in all it's not a bad book for pure entertainment but is somewhat juvenile in it's style. I think next time I will resist purchasing a Rollins book.
0786838655|5.0|In a world where Greek gods control everything, teenagers train to do the biddings of their godly parents. This story is about three teens that must go on an adventure to retrieve a stolen item with magical properties.  The Lightning Thief is an adventurous story because of the challenges and risks the characters have to go through. Percy, Annabeth, and Grover have to overcome many obstacles as part of their quest to save the world from destruction during a civil war waged by the Gods. While fighting monsters, they must take many risks to survive, and that is only the tip of the iceberg! The quest is to find Zeus's master bolt and return it to him by the summer solstice (now 10 days away)! To do so, Percy and his friends have to travel across the country. They must travel on the ground, otherwise Zeus will destroy them. Meanwhile, the police think Percy has kidnaped his mother and are searching for him. Will Percy find the master bolt? Will the police capture him? Or, will he die a very horrible death? To find out, you must read The Lightning Thief!  By John, Age 11
0425241505|5.0|Pia is blackmailed by her ex-boyfriend to steal something from the wyr-dragon, Dragos.. Determined not to give her ex anything valuable, she grabs a penny from a jar and replaces it with another one and writes a note saying that she is sorry. Easy peasy, right? NOPE! Dragos quickly finds the impostor penny and freaks out. He puts a tracking spell on Pia so that he can hunt her down and make her pay. The only problem is, when he finds her he no longer wants to rend her limb from limb but instead wants to keep her as his new treasure.<br /><br />The story is written half in Pia's head and half in Dragos'. So you pretty much always know what the other character is thinking. This made for some interesting dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, that was pretty much my favorite part of the book. Not that the steamy scenes weren't good and all but I loved the way they talked to each other. You see, Dragos is used to being the highest on the food chain. He isn't used to having to be nice to people to get his way, he just tells them what to do and they do it. So when Pia comes along and she tells him when people ask for something they say please, he quickly catches on and uses that to his advantage to get what he wants from her.<br /><br />The pace of the book ran along smoothly. The story doesn't just contain Pia and Dragos. You see when Pia ran to hide from Dragos after stealing the penny, she hid on elven territory which is land forbidden to Dragos. Although he doesn't care and goes there anyway to find his thief which causes a little bit of trouble. Which sort of snowballs into more trouble after that.<br /><br />Favorite quotes: -I couldn't choose just one this time<br />Pia-\\"Wouldn't it be better if the elves just shut up and go away? Hey, what if they stopped throwing a fit at you walking across their backyard. It's not like you ate their tulips or dug holes in their lawn. You didn't piss on any trees when I wasn't looking, did you?\\"<br />Dragos laughs \\"I would have if I'd thought of it.\\"<br /><br />My other favorite is...<br />Pia- \\"A dragon just gave me a piece of jewelry. Have I been added to his hoard?\\"<br />Graydon- \\"No, cupcake, I'm pretty sure you've replaced it.\\"<br /><br />[...]hought of it.\\"<br /><br />My other favorite is...<br />Pia- \\"A dragon just gave me a piece of jewelry.

0439023491|5.0|Do you love books with unicorns, pink palaces, and happily ever after endings? If so, do not read Catching Fire, by Suzanne Collins. Catching Fire is extremely intense and interesting from the beginning to end because every second Katniss Everdeen has to go through something violent or unusual.  In this book, Katniss starts her second hunger games, even though her life is already hard enough without it. Gale holds her at an icy distance and President Snow threatens to kill her family if she cannot stop the rebellion. Katniss is being forced to marry Peeta. Katniss is afraid that she has started an unjust she can't stop. Another thing I love about Catching Fire is its memorable characters. One of the characters that puzzled me the most was Katniss. Katniss is the main character in the Hunger Games series.  Katniss is puzzling to me because it is hard to tell what she says that is true and what is a lie. Another interesting thing about Katniss is that she gets very messed up mentally from all of the violence she has been through and she has lots of trouble from killing so many people. Peeta is another important and interesting character in the Hunger Games series because he loves Katniss and Katniss is determined to save him from the Capitol.  Sparks are igniting. Flames are spreading. And the capitol wants revenge. What will happen? Find out by reading the sequel to the Hunger Games, Catching Fire.<br /><br />READ IT!<br /><br />by Grace, [...]

I just want my guy's head to stay looking straight ahead ALL the time, whether I touch that part of the controller or not. I have been in the pc world since about 93 and have custom built/fixed many. I played the original Duke Nukem 3d and the head was automatically locked straight ahead, you had to turn on mouse movement if you wanted to look up into a window, etc. If someone can help me, please reply and advance thanks for the help.

B004G25V9S|1.0|This is by far Opeth's worst album based on so many factors.  People that like it love to claim its death metal fans that hate it, but they have no clue.  Death metalheads could care less about Opeth because their death metal side is mediocre.  Opeth, until this album, create the perfect blend of beautiful melodies and crushing heaviness.  Heritage blends a bunch of random influences in a sloppy and lazy format.  Essentially, take any Opeth album and replace all the heavy parts with quiet guitar work or silence and add some random jazz and 70's sounds.  It is horrible album and has sullied the Opeth name.  I will admit there are some catchy riffs and segments, but they are surrounded by seemingly endless amounts of aimless ideas that don't work and do not create a real album.
B000AY74OG|5.0|I already love M2 and hadn't seen M1 since it came out, this was a great way to refresh my memory and still have the movie for years to come.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|I love Gilmore Girls and the witty dialect that contains various cultural references. It's a great entertainment TV series and addresses issues that most teenage girls and students in general must deal with in high school. As always, the relationship between Lorelai and her daughter Rory is portrayed as open and honest, an ideal relationship that rarely exists! Love the series and would definitely recommend the DVD set to own for everyone who feels the same way.
B005G0YP3M|5.0|This remaster, done finally by GG, has a very warm mix with balanced highs and lows. Similarly to the Beatles' 2009 remasters, Octopus gives me the feeling of listening to a pristine lp as opposed to the volume-max-out mixes that are currently in vogue. Having attended the concert (Bonus Track - Octopus Medley) at the Calerdone Theater on 7/3/76, this was particularly special for me to have this included. This track and also the one included on the Freehand 30th Anniversary CD are a great representation of the energy generated by GG at those '76 shows.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|The DVD will contained the live streaming held on October 2, 2011 at the Royal Albert Hall.  I had the privilege of seeing it in the theater in the U.S. on 10/2/11 and once again on 10/5/11 as a rebroadcasted Encore performance.  I'm so excited that I'll be able to watch it again and again.  The taping of the show and cinematography were spectacular.  You by no means feel like you are in a seat in the audience watching it from may rows in front of the stage.  No, you are up close, on stage, beholding closeups of the various performers play their iconic roles to perfection.  You see the costumes like you've never seen them before, the rage and hurt in the Phantom's eyes, the conflict and yearning of Christine for two men.  The performances of Ramin Karimloo (Phantom), Sierra Boggess (Christine), and Hadley Fraser (Raoul) are nothing less than brilliant, as well as the rest of the cast.  If you love Phantom on stage, you'll love this DVD. The after performance reprisals of the Phantom of the Opera and the Music of the Night with legends such as Sarah Brightman, Anthony Warlow, John Owen Jones, and Colm Wilkinson will move you to tears, plus the appearance of Michael Crawford, Andrew Lloyd Webber (of course), Cameron Mackintosh, and Charles Hart.  This DVD is a Phantom keepsake indeed.

B00013F35I|5.0|The sound compared to the New York concert is a little muffled and his voice is a little rough this night BUT this concert has heart and soul. Truly the best concert disc he has released. The passion of the man is on display in spades. E Streeters are on form as always. I do wonder at times though why have 4 guitars (Bruce,Patti, Nils and Steve) it makes the sound congested and the music just doesn't \\"breathe\\".
0618918248|1.0|Point: Belief in any supernatural god is ridiculously unscientific, unhelpful, and dangerous to fellow humans.<br /><br />Path:  Chapter 1 - religion has caused lots of problems, but no one is able to talk about it. It is off limits.<br />Chapter 2 - \\"any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution.\\"<br />Chapter 3 - all arguments for God fail<br />Chapter 4 - Argument from improbability - basically a hyped up version of \\"Who created God?\\"<br />Chapter 5 - Answering from where religion comes - a desire, a placebo, a meme? Who can say?<br />Chapter 6 - \\"Then why are we good?\\" 1. We aren't. 2. Misfiring nerves.<br />Chapter 7 - The Bible is horrific in its dealings with others. Do you really want to claim that?<br />Chapter 8 - fundamentalism (believing the Scriptures of your faith) undercuts science, and therefore is unacceptable<br />Chapter 9 - it is child abuse to bring up a child in a religious upbringing.<br />Chapter 10 - If there is a gap in every person that needs to be filled, why fill it with God? Why not science, art, human friendship, humanism, etc.?<br /><br />Sources: Websites, critics, current literature.<br /><br />Agreement: Religion - as a form of reaching God- is dangerous.<br /><br />Disagreement: The author is overly infatuated with science. He is caustic and angry. Full of misinterpretations, exaggerations and over generalizations.<br /><br />Personal App: Evidence will not argue a person into belief. Only the Holy Spirit can change a heart.<br /><br />I couldn't stomach most of it.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Mile 81 was somewhat promising at the start.  It started to fizzle about halfway through with the realization that the reader was going to have no connection to the characters.  Then out of nowhere, BAM, end of story.  I honestly thought my download hadn't completed.  I love Stephen King, but this one was out of character.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I've been a fan of Anthrax since 'Spreading the Disease' came out...and have liked them through the Bush years. So I am not coming from the angle of an \\"early days only\\" fan. I LOVE thrash, but I like all types of metal.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much from this release, but I actually find it very enjoyable. With all of the screaming in metal becoming uninspired, it is good to hear a metal album with singing. Like with the latest Flotsam & Jetsam release, this CD is NOT better than their legendary releases, but that is fine. I'll take it anyways. Joey sounds great on these songs, no problems AT ALL with his voice and his vocal patterns stick in your head. The music is pretty mid-paced like you would expect. Anthrax was never super-thrashy to begin with. The first couple of songs are up-tempo and more like older 'Thrax while a few of the later songs sound more like something from the Bush years. But the common thread throughout is that the songs are catchy and memorable and I keep wanting to listen to the CD. It wouldn't surprise me if I came back later and gave this another star once I have listened to it even more. (UPDATE: I came back and added the fifth star - these are just flat-out great metal songs)<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention the bonus track. It is hidden after silence on the last track. Seriously? People stopped \\"hiding\\" tracks like that back in the 90's. It is just annoying. Just give the track a number and list it already. Anyways, it is a cover by the band The Refused of the song 'New Noise'. The track is a pseudo-cult classic, but I think the original is just ok...and this cover is not even better than the original. The original at least had some angst and energy to it. This song just doesn't fit Anthrax.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Ok, so let me just begin by saying I'm shakin my head at all of the Beyonce haters....it's sad that whenever someone has attained the magnitude of commercial success that beyonce has, some people just cant take it. ...She's a sell out, she aint got no soul, she's not original, blah blah blah.  Now we're all entitled to our own opinions, but quite frankly, how people can say that this album is a failure or not her best work is baffling!   Ok...moving on to the actual review...I'll just go track by track:  \\"1 + 1\\"   Beyonce opens with the most powerful ballad I've heard her sing in a long time (since \\"Dangerously In Love\\")...she definately has soul, energy, power, grace (the way she controls her vocals is amazing).  \\"I Care\\"  This is one of my favorite tracks on the album...her voice is undeniably strong, powerful, and she has that beautiful control again.  I love the drums in the background, and she kills it when she matches chords of the the guitar solo...she sounds angry, frustrated and fed up on this one...AND I LOVE IT! Definately blast this one when I'm in that kind of mood...I love how B can convey emotion so well in her music.  Plus, I thought the \\"la la la\\" was a great touch.  \\"I Miss You\\"  Love this one...she's so vulnerable...communicating a simple message \\"I miss my man\\" in a beautiful way.  \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\"  Love it! Beyonce sings about how she \\"dodged the bullet\\" on giving her heart to a man she thought was THE one. \\"And to think there's a time when I almost loved you/ you showed your ASS and I saw the real you.../I wanted you bad/ I'm so through with that!/ Cuz honestly you turned out to be the best thing I never had/ I bet it sucks to be you right now!\\" A beautiful production by Babyface, great strong vocals by B; overall a great song that many women can relate to.  \\"Party\\"  Out of all the tracks on the album, I'm feelin this the least.  The beat is good, got a nice groove to it...but it seems out of place and immature among the other tracks; It sounds like something that would be on an old Destiny's Child album and it doesnt showcase her strong vocals at all.   \\"Rather Die Young\\"  Another solid track...very self explanatory; she'd rather die young than live without her husband. She starts off soft and sweet, but sings the chorus strong and bold.  Love the bass on this one too.  \\"Start Over\\"  My favorite track on the album.  Where to begin...the lyrics are so...powerful: \\"Maybe we've reached a mountain peak, and there's no more left to climb/ Maybe we've lost a magic piece, and we're both too blind to find/ Let's start over...\\" Of course, B's delivery is strong and on point...production is amazing...just an overall beautiful, amazing, well done track.  \\"Love on Top\\"  Such a feel good track...one reviewer said it reminded them of something a young MJ would've done...totally agree...maybe that's why I like it so much :-  But B's vocals are just as strong as ever on this one (are you noticing a pattern here???) and she makes the song her own. As an aside, she performed the hell outta this song on the VMA's this year!  \\"Countdown\\"  My favorite dance track on the album.  It's so damn creative...the beat is hot, she just plain kills it singing about her and her boo.  \\"End of Time\\"  Another hot dance track...I'm very much into African music, and so the drums on this track sold me.  Just a great song all around.  \\"I Was Here\\"  Sighs...AGAIN, B kills it on vocals...she delivers a simple message: I want people to know that I've made my mark in the music industry....and with this album she most certainly has. One reviewer said that she should've closed the album out with this track...I agree.    \\"Run The World (Girls)\\"  Ok, everyone is sooo hype about bashing this song...oh it barely charted, then fell off quick, Beyonce is too old to be singing about how girls run the world, the song doesnt show growth cuz it sounds like something that should be on IASF, blah blah blah.  Beyonce said so herself that her niche is empowering women...it's something she does well and she knows this.  Again, I jus smdh at the haters...I dont care what NO ONE says, the song is HOT. The beat is HOT...again, the drums do it to me...and ok, so the concept of women dancing in the desert taunting a bunch of dudes has been done by Janet and Mya already, but whatever...choreography is still on point and the video is still a great production.  If you couldn't tell, I LOVE THIS ALBUM...but I'm not just saying this cuz I want to be a rebel and go against B's haters.  Beyonce IS very commercial, but not because she sings empty, immature pop songs with no depth or meaning; she appeals to a world wide audience because she's a damn good vocalist, writer, and entertainer.  If people would just put their prejudices about this woman aside and actually LISTEN to the album, you cant deny the fact that she has grown so much vocally and lyrically as an artist; She really is the MJ of her generation.
B000JIHP88|5.0|We bought three of these for our triplet infants (one for each crib) and they absolutely loved them.  The color scheme and the animals were very cute and kept the babies entertained. We did not use the remote control provided at all.    The kids enjoyed falling asleep to the night light.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Always looking for a sufficiently challenging yet relaxing puzzle game for my Nexus. Fun! I have Only played the first few levels... thus far relatively easy. sounds are lovely.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|IMO this is the best bible app. Sooo many versions, lots of reading plans. It will read to you. you can make  notes, and read offline. A concordance &amp; bible dictionary would make it even better.  I highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed!!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Really like this dvd, the extras are great. did some peaking at the movie before it came out, so I knew the movie and the eventual dvd would be great. how the special effects, the costuming, the cast--good insight! if you've read comics, or remember your mythology--you'll love this movie! hope there is a sequel! but at least we can see Thor in the new avengers movie coming out in 2012! a must see for the fantasy movie buff! good to have if you don't have two blue ray players!
B004ZN9ERI|5.0|I am making my comparison to this album to the one in the Oh By The Way box set. A huge sonic improvement. I am glad that I have purchased these albums once again but am feeling somewhat cheated having bought the Oh By The Way  box set. It will be used to gander at the mini-lp style packaging from here on in. Don't hesitate to purchase all of the remastered catalogue, money well spent this time around.
B004Z4LVZK|2.0|Maybe if I hadn't heard it compared to The Hunger Games, I might have lowered my expectations enough to enjoy this flat-as-a-pancake Young Adult dystopian adventure. But the poor writing and non-existent character development would have been hard to overcome in any context.  The premise is great: 16-year-old Thomas arrives in an unfamiliar place in a box, with no memory of who he is or his past. He quickly learns that he's part of a colony of boys who have all arrived the same way, and now live in a thriving settlement alongside a giant maze that contains terrifying mechanical beasts. A group of the boys runs through this maze each day and then maps their route, trying to find a way out. The trouble is, the walls of the maze move every night.  So far, so good. But the problem is that now you know almost the entire action of the book, save the last few chapters. And it's hard to warm up to Thomas, a character who spends an inordinate amount of time thinking about how to respond to things he's told: he's always trying to keep from yelling, or despairing of communicating, or not knowing what to say. It's an odd glitch that the author seems unconscious of (it never arises as a plot point, which I was certain it would). Meanwhile, the narration veers in and out of colloquialisms (\\"Thomas was pumped to hear this . . . \\") that already sound dated. It's jarring.  With all the great YA books out there, I'm sad to say that The Maze Runner is simply not worth your time.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|First of all , I have to say this game is not for everyone. If you like fast paced action game, like first person shooter or hack and slash, you wont find it in here. this collection is for people who have patience and enjoys a art of a game, I lack in the first department but I appreciate the art of a game. I played years ago the shadow of colussus on the ps2 , and I did totally love it, I havent played Ico on the ps2, so this time is my first playthough for the game, and here is what I think of these two remastered in Hd edition of two of most high rated games on ps2:<br /><br />Let start with Ico:<br />Ico is about a boy who is going to be sacrificed because of he having horns.... xD . then something happens, and your mission is to get Yorda  a girl , lucky u Ico!) out of the temple you are. the gameplay is a combination of puzzle and bit of slashing shadow, which can be somewhat repetitive. Ico although having a nice settings and cool environemnts is freaking frustating. Yorda, is... let say .. ok .. she is stupid. Her reaction a response are quite slow and frustating , most of the time you need to grab her to get her moving. puzzle are quite challenging which is good. graphics are in hd but still have those blocky section like the ps2. I havent beat the game yet, is quite fun and beautiful, I would update these review as fast as I finish the game. For now I would give a 8.5 to Ico.<br /><br />Now with the main dish of the collection, Shadow of colossus =D<br />I have to admit that this time didnt have the same impact I had when i played it one the ps2 years ago. Mainly because I know the story and what would happen next.  In terms ofgraphics, it dint surprise me , it is far inferior to games like metal gear 4 , God of war 3 , Uncharted 2 and Mw2... Still the art design is amazingly breathtaking. the gameplay still exciting. But if you are expecting a fast paced action, like i said before you would totally bored in this game. You would only see this game as climbing-stab-collosus kind of game. But if you know how to apreciate the art design and like to do puzzle, then this game is perfect for you. this game is kind of touching your character is fighting with everything  he have just to save the one he love... aw[...] isnt it beautiful ? and again if you find this cheesy this game is not for you xD . For the amazing art desing, beautiful story, wierd vices but peaceful and exciting sundtrack and challeging gameplay I would give it a 9.4. This is because this is my second play , if this was my very first time i would have given it a 10 , but it just dint have the same impact...<br /><br />In the end, this is a great collection, Ico may be some of frustating, but if you have patience then it is not a problem, but if you are a hasty person like I am , you would completly get frustated. But on the other Hand shadow of colossus justify the buy. Just this amazing game is the very reason to own this cd. so why dont you buy it and enjoy a beautiful game ?<br /><br />Ps: it come with bonus content, two dinamic themes, I find it very pretty but the wierd effect like the old movies have just destroyed the theme... -.- there is also trophy for this gamegame. But if you know how to apreciate the art design and like to do puzzle, then this game is perfect for you. this game is kind of touching your character is fighting with everything  he have just to save the one he love... aw[...] isnt it beautiful ? and again if you find this cheesy this game is not for you xD .

B004PVKFR8|5.0|I love this album, almost in entirety - the two tracks entitled 'some sort of creature' and 'My Nightmare's Dream,' while appropriate for this album, I don't care for. Every other track is genius - and i absolutely love this album!
0062103377|4.0|I enjoyed Bobby's Guide to Hunting more than the recent tv tie-in novels. It's written as if Bobby really wrote it. I only have a few problems with the continuity. Samhain's eye color and Azazel's gun shot wound location were inaccurate, but not a big deal. It does mention what happend in Omaha with Rufus. This is worth the read to any hardcore Supernatural fan.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Stunning movie! By far one of the best movies ever written. It starts out kind of lame, but after about the 1st ten minutes i have ever seen! truly amazing and heart warming
B00164GDA0|4.0|I thought that this would be a great movie to watch with our 12 year old, since it is based on that age of kid, and I remember the story fondly.  I found out quickly that it is not appropriate for this age group.  All of the swear words used frequently, smoking, etc.  After shutting it off and watching something else with the kids, mommy and I watched it and enjoyed it tremendously.  I do remember the short story, or novelette titled \\"The Body\\" (Stephen King) being slightly better than the movie, but this is a classic.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I can agree with many of the reviews, the graphics could be better. It seems like a ported game, rather than something built from the ground up for the Android platform. Could use general overhaul in both the graphics and UI departments.  That being said, it is still a fun game when you want some mindless gameplay. With some updates it could be a great game.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|The acting is supurb, especailly Judy Dench and Tim Curry....a truly heartwarming story of how progress and change effect a small, rural English town and its inhabitants....and a picture of how life was before the use of electricity....very enjoyable....a window on the past.....
B0016MJ6HY|3.0|On the extras, Norah Jones said that this movie plays out like a jazz song. I think that is an accurate description. My Blueberry Nights is upbeat, harmonic, soulful, and has a strong sense of rhythm with improvised camera work (which can be a bit grating at times). The story is very basic, a girl deals with her heartbreak by visiting a pie shop and soon runs away from a potential romance by traveling across America where she meets offbeat characters while sending postcards to her potential love interest. The actors push a mediocre storyline into a kinda good movie, particularly Rachel Weisz, David Strathairn, and Natalie Portman.
B0056HTEC2|5.0|Like many Brits Hugh gets the feel of the blues and better yet he can jam with the best of them.  I loved most of the takes and think this is a great album for anyone who things the blues are old hat and stuck in the same old same.  I bought the Special Edition the extra takes didn't add much to the album, but I liked the small book that came with it.   Check this album out I think you'll be surprized and find yourself tapping your feet and nodding at the emotion it brings.  I hope he follows this one up with another.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|This is a mind tripping, intense, creepy, and clever time travel movie. What I love about this movie is that it also depicts schizophrenia and its terrifying decent into madness and despair. If you take away the concrete notions of time travel, it could easily be an excellent portrayal of the emotional and psychological turmoil of mental illness.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|Product was fine, price was right. Funny movie to watch before going to Europe. Thanks for an easy transaction and good product!
B000YABYLA|5.0|This is a hip, quirky, and downright cute movie. I watched the movie twice before returning it back and I rarely do that. I loved the fact that Juno is such a teenager; she never tries to be a mature adult or a complete airhead/slacker as most teenagers are portrayed in movies. I really enjoyed the stepmother and stepdaughter dynamic as it really felt realistic. One more thing: I want a hamburger phone!!! Note: Sadly, all the extras are not closed captioned.
B0018M6J90|4.0|An entertaining and whimsical movie! What I liked most about this film is the light tone of a screwball comedy. Frances McDormand is fabulous at fast-paced repartee and Amy Adams simply shines. I also adored Lee Pace's performance as the man hopelessly in love with Delysia who doesn't try to hide his anguish. The art direction is fantastic and the clothes are divine. All in all, this movie is a great 90-minute escape from reality.
B000BKVQTS|1.0|I absolutely love fairy tale stories, however, this film is just a big mess and it's hard to articulate what I hate about this film. The actors are good, the art direction is excellent but sadly it is simply a bore.
B0029SCFE0|4.0|My my... this is one trippy movie! I was completely absorbed and sat still for the next two hours which is rare for me. The storyline is shocking and devastating. The actors are all wonderful and could accuracy convey anguish. I wanted to turn my head away for several parts of the film but refused because I didn't want to miss a second.
B0019OP0GU|3.0|A charming and appealing film with a theatrical feel. I think lots of tweens will relate to the three girls who have dreams that they strive for and have to learn how to achieve them when messy life gets in the way. This movie reminds me of the American Girl stories. I'm impressed with the young actress Yasmin Paige as Petrova; she shows remarkable talent. I found myself bored even though the pacing moved at a remarkable speed. Basically, I was entertained for an hour and twenty minutes but it's a forgettable film.
B004XUMN1M|5.0|In my opinion, this is Joss Whedon's best television series.  The cast has fantastic chemistry and the writing is terrific.  Joss has created an entire sci-fi universe which is easily on par with Star Trek and Star Wars.  It's one of the most beloved science fiction television shows of all time.  I have yet to meet anyone who has not watched the first two episodes and didn't fall in love with the show.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I have always found what I was searching for at Amazon.Great to deal with,with really Super Bargains. Always pleased with the great Selections
159562015X|5.0|There are two parts to this book: one is the book itself and the second is the assessment (which a code that comes with the book gives you access to). The book itself has valuable information in it but the assessment is the primary value of this package.  This book benefited me in a few ways:  * There is an essay at the beginning of the book providing an overview of the author's views on the importance of understanding and applying your strengths. This helped me understand, in particular, that I needed to be in a job where I could consistently apply my strengths. I also came to understand that the job I was in at the time was a poor match for my skillset and that I needed to move on to something that was better suited for me. The author describes some of the effects of working in a job that was a poor match for you and it was like he was reading my mail. I can't help but think that there are a lot of other people like me out there who could be saved a lot of unhappiness and stress by the ideas in that essay.  * It helped me understand what my top 5 areas of strength were. Some of these were not a surprise; some of these were completely new to me but made sense once they were explained to me. For example, my assessment said that I am a strategic thinker (meaning that I am good at coming up with alternatives and identifying patterns and issues). I had never thought of that, but once that was pointed out to me I can see that in myself.  * It helped enable me to articulate what my strengths were. This was especially important on job interviews, where I used to dread the infamous \\"what are your greatest strengths?\\" question. Now I can answer that question with ease in a way that presents my qualifications in the best possible light and I can even relate my strengths to other questions in the interview process. I spent a long time as a contractor working on a lot of short-term projects so I have gone through the interview process repeatedly since I read this book and havegotten quite a few jobs; I attribute my success at least in part to this book.  * It helped me understand what distinguishes me from other people.  * It helped me understand how to apply my strengths.  Regardless of what stage you are in your career, this book can help you be more successful. Not just at work but as a person. I can now see better how I can use my strengths to benefit others and can apply my strengths in personal relationships, organizational leadership, and even my hobbies.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|OK, I am no artist, nor am I much of a photographer, but it took me less than 30 seconds to see the fun applications for this program.  IN ADDITION it took me less than 15 seconds to figure out how to open a photo from my gallery and apply the effects. I can't believe people actually complain about a missing feature, when the feature is right there for you to use!  I love this app!
