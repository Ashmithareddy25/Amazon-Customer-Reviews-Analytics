B005KXT58U|4.0|Very typical Evanescence, rock hard riffs, driving beats, screaming vocals and the formula churns out another good album. There's not much new stylistic change from this album from the others.

B007MDQW3W|3.0|I don't normally write music reviews because the matter is so subjective, but I wanted to draw attention to the bonus track titled Call Them Brothers, which I didn't learn about until after I bought the 11-track version of What We Saw From The Cheap Seats. I like this song more than all the other songs on the album. The track is included with the [[ASIN:B0082JYEEO Deluxe Version]] of the album, and Amazon offers it as a separate [[ASIN:B0082JYGHE MP3 download]]. Amazon also sells a different version of Call Them Brothers as an [[ASIN:B004GF6HPW MP3 download]] that features Spektor.<br /><br />The reason I rated What We Saw From The Cheap Seats three stars is because some of the songs are too polished for my liking. For example, I strongly prefer the version of Ne Me Quitte Pas on [[ASIN:B000009F38 Songs (2002)]] to the version on What We Saw From The Cheap Seats.<br /><br />I thought some of the songs on [[ASIN:B00204AA0O Far (2009)]] were too polished as well, and I was hoping What We Saw From The Cheap Seats would have a more raw sound like Spektor's earlier albums.<br /><br />The album [[ASIN:B0046M14WQ Live in London (2010)]] includes performances of songs from Far that I think are better (less polished, more raw) than the studio recordings. Hopefully, Spektor will release a live album that includes songs from What We Saw From The Cheap Seats.
B0073PPKNM|3.0|I could not wait for this album since I am a big fan of Melody Gardot. I am a bit disappointed, though. This album is too \\"exotic\\" to my taste and not as \\"jazzy\\" as the other two. To me, there are too many, let's say, \\"Copacabana-style\\" songs. I miss Melody's old style; one in which you can actually enjoy her voice in every song.

Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />Bought this from my local Good Will for 1 dollar.  Good condition, looked like it was never read, it may not have been...<br /><br />This Philip K. Dick novel was the source material for the 'Blade Runner' movie, directed by Ridgley Scott.  This is a case where movie DOES rival book.<br /><br />If you are like me and have seen 'Blade Runner' in it's various cuts a million times, you would logically want to read the source material.  I recently just got done reading the 'Time Machine' by H.G. Wells.  This WAS an instance where book rivaled movie.  Usually this is the case.  However, at least for me this book was a chore to read.<br /><br />***Book/Plot Details, Differences From Film, Some Spoilers Ahead***<br /><br />The book begins with Rick Deckard waking up at his apartment with his wife.  Difference number 1, Deckard is married.  The book goes into pain-staking detail about the mood devices that everyone uses.  These devices artifically induce emmotions in the user, i.e. if you want to feel happy, you dial in happy.  It goes much deeper than this, with the emotional spectrum being pretty broad for the dialers.<br /><br />I personally found this out of place and well...kind of weird.<br /><br />The book however does go into detail on the statis of animals on Earth now.  Watching the movie you will notice that most animals are stated to be artificial.  Well, why are they?  While the movie doesn't really go into detail about this, the book does.  It's rather simple really, nuclear fallout has killed most animals off.  Thus the few surviving ones are HIGHLY prized and sought after.  People pay 30,000 thousand for an animal such as a goat!!!  People must own an animal, it's the ultimate sign of statis and fortune.  To not own an animal means you are a nobody.  Thus people constantly obsess and save for these rare beasts.  Deckard in particular always has a price guide on his person with animal prices and is always checking it.<br /><br />Those who do not have an animal, or those whose animals die will buy \\"artificial\\" animals that appear completely life-like and real.  They will do this to keep up appearances.  Deckard himself does this, as his sheep recently died.  But to have an electronic animal is a secret shame, and Deckard desperately wants to regain a real animal.<br /><br />I only go into such detail about this because the book goes into such detail about it.  Are there other plot points, sure.  There are the androids, and other characters.  But the main driving point is Deckard getting a real animal again.<br /><br />The movie itself, does not go into such importance of animals, although it does talk briefly about how expensive they are.<br /><br />The film is loaded with film-noir elements, epic landscapes and totally submerges you in Sci-Fi glory.  The book does not do this.<br /><br />Despite all that it contains it really boils down to the story of a boy wanting a puppy, so to speak.  Also this \\"boy\\" is not happy with his marriage.  Deckards wife in the book mopes around the apartment all day and there is not much love displayed between them.  She only appears happy when Deckard retires 3 androids and is able to buy them an outragiously priced goat.<br /><br />---In Conclusion---<br /><br />This book is loved by many.  I personally did not enjoy most of it, sure it does have some thought provoking elements in it, but overall does not stand up to the film.  If you can find it cheap like I did, I would say buy it.  But it's not worth the price of above 2 dollars.  AGAIN, this is my opinion, nothing more.  I will say reading this will add insite into the film, and next time you watch the movie you will have some new perceptions you may not have had before.  To sum up, not as good as the movie, if you still want to read it, rent it from your library or buy it cheap.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful, now if you'll excuse me I'm due to take a Voight-Kampff test...ime you watch the movie you will have some new perceptions you may not have had before.  To sum up, not as good as the movie, if you still want to read it, rent it from your library or buy it cheap.<br /><br />Hope this review is helpful, now if you'll excuse me I'm due to take a Voight-Kampff test...

Now on to my review.<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />Fun fact before I begin.  Brian Cox, who is in this 'Red' I'm reviewing is also in another film entitled 'Red'.  The later 'Red' is about a man whose only friend in the world is killed by some punk kids.  His only friend is his dog.  Afterward things escalate for everyone, and Cox's character finds himself taking justice into his own hands.  I've never seen it, but it did well, (as far as renting goes).  People who rented it seemed to like it.  I plan on watching it sometime in the future.  Anyway...<br /><br />This CIA infused 'Red' is quite a fun ride.  This was definitely a side project for all the actors involved, but they give it 100 percent, and it shows.  This movie delivers an all star cast involving:  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, the previously mentioned Brian Cox, Richard Dreyfuss, Karl Urban, Mary-Louise Parker and others.<br /><br />This title came out a few years ago but is still an enjoyable film to watch.<br /><br />***Movie/Plot Details, Some Spoilers Ahead***<br /><br />The premise is simple, R.E.D. stands for \\"Retired, Extremely, Dangerous.\\"  This cast of ex-killers are exactly that.  They may be up in years a little, but their skills are far from rusty.  The film first centers in on Bruce Willis's character, Frank Moses, a former CIA asset who is having a hard time adjusting to normal un-exciting civilian life.  He has no friends, no hobbies, and the only joy he has is ripping up his government paychecks so he has an excuse to call Mary-Louise Parker at the human resources department.  It's sad really.<br /><br />Well, things heat up rather quick for Frank Moses, he is assaulted in his very own house by a killing squad one night.  After dispatching them all, this is Bruce Willis we're talking about, he goes on the road, kidnaps ...Parker and gets his old band of killing buddies back together to try and figure out why they are all getting marked for death after all these years.<br /><br />There is an uneasyness between all the cast, every time they come face to face they always ask the same question, \\"Are you here to kill me?\\"  They may be formal work mates but they are killers after all, and there can only be so much trust I guess.<br /><br />Malkovich's character is by far the funniest in the movie.  He's your classic paranoid loner type.  The funny part is, his paranoias are actually true.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman's screen time is not enough in my opinion, but the little he has is good.  Mirren and Brian Cox round out the team and we the viewers are left with a collection of actors that really work well together and deliver a good movie.<br /><br />Oh...by the way Karl Urban is in the film.  He's the younger CIA wet work asset who is after Bruce Willis and the others.  Good fight scene between him and Willis.<br /><br />---To Sum Up---<br /><br />Great, funny, and action packed film.  I enjoyed it at the movie theater and on DVD numerous times.  It's really going for cheap now, so grab this one up.  Will there be a sequel?  I certainly hope so, this is too good to not jump into again.<br /><br />Well that's my thoughts on this awesome movie.  Now if you'll excuse me there's someone at my door with a gun...oh it's just Bruce Willis.assaulted in his very own house by a killing squad one night.

B00005JKC3|3.0|----------------------------------------<br />Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />I remember seeing this over 9 years ago.  At the time I thought it was a good film.  But...as we age and our tastes get refined, we start knowing better.  Also the one flaw this movie has is that it DOESN'T FOLLOW THE SOURCE MATERIAL, I.E. THE COMIC BOOKS!!!  That's a big deal.<br /><br />Also the acting by Eric Bana was really unimpressive.  Nick Nolte, well he's Nick Nolte, looking as if he was fresh out of prison in this movie, crazy hair and all.  Jennifer Connelly while good in other films, felt out of place in this one.  The only actor I actually think gave a GOOD performance was the great Sam Elliot, as General \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross.<br /><br />***Major Difference in this Hulk and the Comic Book Hulk***<br /><br />If you are a comic book reader or if you have at least heard of 'The Hulk' you know that Bruce Banner gets exposed to gamma radiation.  In the comics it's a bomb explosion he's exposed to.  In the tv series and the 'Incredible Hulk' movie and 'Avengers' movie, he's exposed to gamma radiation in that weird looking rotating chair.  Still, simple concept, radiation exposure = Hulk.  Sure, there are other factors, Bruce was beaten as a child by a drunk father and this is why he's angry as the Hulk, etc.  Still over all, a good simple concept that has worked since the 1960's.<br /><br />Enter Ang Lee, a director who wants to take this beloved character in another direction.  Ang envisions a 30 foot Hulk, who is the way he is for other complicated reasons.  Well...here it goes.<br /><br />***Movie/Plot Details, Spoiler Alert, But I would not worry about it...***<br /><br />David Banner (Nick Nolte) when he was younger worked as an Army scientist whose passion was to make people stronger and resistant to diseases.  The beginning of the movie shows him dissecting a jelly-fish, a salmonder, a sea cucumber, a star-fish, and other creatures and collecting their genetic material.  After numerous experiments he successfully implants these various genes into a spider-monkey and after gasing the poor thing with cyonide, it survives.  He realizes then that he has strengthened the monkey's cellular structure and made it a stronger organism.<br /><br />He of course goes to Thaddeus Ross and demands to start human test subjects.  Ross of course says NO, and thus David Banner must resort to other measures.  He begins to test on himself.  He soon discovers that he may have modified himself genetically, but isn't quite sure of the results.  He then is informed by his wife that she is pregnant and they are going to have a child.  Little Bruce is born 9 months later.<br /><br />David soon discovers that the genes he has spliced into himself were passed on to his child.  Notice the green tinge of color on the baby's arms and legs when his pacifer is yanked away... David is horrified and wants to find a cure for this accident.  Ross however explores Banner's lab and finds out he has broken protocal and has been doing human testing.  Ross tells Banner he is finished.  David seems to suffer a mental break-down and causes the Army base's gamma nuclear power plant to overload and explode.  He then heads home to stab Bruce with a kitchen knife, but Bruce's mother fights and gets stabbed and killed herself.  Little Bruce witnesses all of this, and this is eluded to as the reason he is so violent as the Hulk.<br /><br />Long story short David Banner is taken away, little Bruce is put into foster care and grows up with all his young life repressed in his mind.<br /><br />This is where the movie really takes a weird turn.  It seems the now Dr. Bruce Banner is working on \\"Nanomeds\\", nano machines that can repair a person once they are inside one's body.  He and Dr. Betty Ross are testing these machines on frogs.  They bombard a frog with gamma radiation, expose it to the nanomeds and hope the frog gets healed by the little molecule machines.  Unfortunately so far all that's happened is the frogs explode.<br /><br />An unfortunate accident happens one day in the lab.  A lab assistant is caught in the lab, Bruce comes in to get him free of the equipment.  For some reason the gamma emitters come on full blast, and the nanomeds get released.  Bruce ingests the nanomeds and gets a whallop of gamma radiation.<br /><br />He wakes up in the hospital seemingly okay, apparently the nanomeds saved him.<br /><br />I'll simply say he's not, and after a visit from his long lost father (Nick Nolte) discovers he does indeed have some weird genes in his dna.<br /><br />So, how exactly/why does he become the Hulk in this movie.  Here it goes.  Bruce inheritated these extra genes from his father.  By the process of them getting passed on, they are purified and integrated better into his genome than his father's.  But the genes are recessive.  They are not dominant genes.  They are sort of just hanging out in his dna, and for quite a while not doing anything.  He grows up, and gets exposed to the gamma radiation.  The gamma apparently \\"unlocks\\" these genes and allows them to become dominant, with the ability to be expressed.  Still his normal human genes are still the most prominant though.  But he now has nano machines swimming around inside of his body.  These machines respond to injury.  When Bruce gets angry, the nano machines interpret anger as \\"injury\\".  But since he has nothing physical to heal, they instead, (for an unexplained reason), restructure him based off his newly expressable artificial genes his father gave him.  I.E. he transforms into the Hulk when angered.<br /><br />Whew...that's a mouthful.  This the reason this movie is not very good.  That and the Hulk is at his biggest, yes he changes size for some reason, 30 feet tall.  Add to it the weird character of Nick Nolte and the fact he becomes the Absorbing Man and you have one big stinker.<br /><br />Are the action scenes good.  Absolutely, they are in fact the only saving grace of this movie, that and Sam Elliot.<br /><br />I could go more into the story, but there's no point.  This particular incarnation of the Hulk has been abandoned.  The Hulk from the 'Avengers' is official Hulk now, and quite cool I might add.  Marvel had the right idea by scrapping 'The Hulk' and starting over with the 'Incredible Hulk'.  It was a far better movie, and is part of the 'Iron-Man', 'Thor', 'Captain America', and 'Avengers' franchise now.<br /><br />---In Conclusion---<br /><br />This movie is a prime example of what happens when you mess with something that is not broken.  All I can say is I'm finally glad the movie studios are listening to the comic-book fanboys and delivering movies that are GOOD and stay true, mostly, to the source material.  Not only does it make for better movies, and box office success, but it keeps the comic book geeks, (like me), happy.  And they should strive to keep us happy, we can make or break a superhero movie's success...<br /><br />Is it worth buying.  Only if you can find it cheap, like 8 bucks and below.  Otherwise just wait for it to come on tv somewhere.  It's showing on the Encore channels right now.  You could just catch it there.<br /><br />Well that's my thoughts.  Hopefully the days of a film like this are over and all we will be getting from this point on is 'Avengers' quality movies.  Here's hoping, and here's hoping that the new 'Man of Steel' movie doesn't suck.  Kevin Costner as Johnathen Kent, it may just have a chance...t can repair a person once they are inside one's body.

B005MHI0QM|5.0|Engrossing. I was taken by surprise as I read Anne's diary. I was expecting to find lots of historical detail about the Holocaust. There is some of that. I was expecting to read the disjointed narrative of loose events. This diary had some of that, too. However, her narrative is a succinct and intimate portrait of two Jewish families, the Franks and the Van Daans, and an unmarried dentist. The diary does begin before her family goes into hiding, on June 12, 1942, but by July 9, Anne begins to chronicle the vicissitudes of the aforementioned families, and her personal reflections. Instead of politics and war, Anne describes quarrels between herself with her mother, Mrs. Van Daan, and Dussel (the dentist), between the Van Daans and the Franks, and between Mrs. Van Daan and Dussel. What makes these accounts astonishing is that Anne describes these quarrels with the irony and maturity of a full-fledged writer, and her tone makes any reader recall the ironies of a Jane Austen narrative (I may go as far as to compare the relationship between Anne and her mother with that of an Elizabeth Bennet with her silly mother in Pride and Prejudice). Only that this is nonfiction, and thus, her rivalry with her mother may be a situation that other teenagers may easily relate to. If Freud had this diary in his hands, he may even go as far as to point out that Anne has an Electra complex (the reverse of the Oedipus complex). Anne makes very clear that she cannot stand her mother and even claims to hate her. She may have modified this \\"hate\\" a year and a half later in the same diary, but she still accepts that she can live without her and that she cannot profess the motherly love. Again, she treads in Jane Austen territory when she claims on February 8, 1944 that her father is not in love with her mother, and that he kisses her the way she kisses them. If this had been fiction, one could find parallels with some Austen novels. Equally astonishing is the level of maturity with which she analyses her parents' matrimonial situation, even if her conclusions were wrong and she was just biased toward her father.<br /><br />In likewise manner, she describes her relationship between herself and Mrs. Van Daan, and the Van Daans. Only a few weeks after their arrival at the secret annex, on September 2, 1942, Anne describes a quarrel between the couple and calls their son lazy, and on September 21, she calls Mrs. Van Daan \\"unbearable.\\" Her antagonism toward Mrs. Van Daan will be one of her recurring topics throughout the diary. There is also plenty of conflict between her and Dussel with whom she has to share her room; and finally, when she is fourteen and a half, and in love with Peter Van Daan, she turns her adolescent rage against her own father in a letter defending her independence from parental intrusion and her right to see Peter as often as she liked. She may regret this afterwards, but this rebellion shows us an outstanding character trait of hers, an indomitable spirit, and one of the major themes in this diary: generational conflict; the world of adults against youngsters. Since the very beginning, Anne finds her privacy and free will threatened, not only by the external forces of the Nazis, but also by her mother, her sister Margot, Mrs. Van Daan, and Dussel. When on March 2, 1944 she writes, \\"We aren't allowed to have an opinion\\" teenagers all over the world will sympathize. Her musings about relationships between youngsters and adults, however, must not be confused with mere griping; her voice is carried by a balance between passion and reason.<br /><br />Along with the threat of parental intrusion upon her freedoms, she talks in depth about sexuality and the need for courage in the face of adversity; the importance of work and.having goals in life; the roots of happiness; the importance of religion (no matter which religious doctrine one follows); the unfortunate growth of anti-Semitism, and her love for Holland. Each one of her discussions are appropriate for teenagers and adults as she speaks with wisdom. In sexuality, she advocates for sexual education at a young age. She feels no shame for her periods and openly confesses on January 6, 1944 that she is \\"always looking forward to the time when I'll feel that secret inside me once again.\\" And when she is falling in love with Peter, she announces on February 12, 1944 \\"I think spring is inside me.\\" In matters of love, she does sound more radical when she claims on March 2, 1944 \\"Losing your virtue doesn't matter, as long as you know that for as long as you live you'll have someone at your side who understands you...\\" But the way she reflects on these issues throughout the diary show a desire to balance out her natural teenage impulses with the reasoning of a maturing adolescent, not a rebel without a cause.<br /><br />Anne also talks about her literary ambitions and she does show her knack for writing with skill. There is a tone of irony in an entry subtitled \\"Peeling Potatoes,\\" August 10, 1943. Once you've read this section you'll discover that it is more than about peeling potatoes. A clever story is subtitled \\"Ode to My Fountain Pen: In Memoriam\\" found on the November 11, 1943 entry. It's about the loss of her fountain pen. She even makes the most out of scary situations when she writes about an attempted break-in into the factory where they are hidden as if she were narrating a suspenseful story. In addition, on many occasions she shows us the sensibility of a poet as she connects with nature even within her confinement: \\"As long as you can look fearlessly at the sky, you'll know that you're pure within and will find happiness once more\\" she states on February 23, 1944. Later on, on March 7, 1944, she  claims her right to beauty in the face of misfortune: \\"If you just look for it, you discover more and more happiness and regain your balance. A person who's happy will make others happy; a person who has courage and faith will never die in misery.\\"<br /><br />This does not mean that Anne's diary has nothing to do with the war or with anti-Semtism. Without these two, without the Nazi menace, Anne would have discovered these things sooner in a freer environment (it took her almost two years to explore love and friendship with Peter), she would have developed her skills as a journalist, a poet, and a writer, had not the Nazis and the war existed. And yet, in spite of the overwhelming presence of the Nazis, anti-Semitism, and war, Anne's greatest triumph was being able to reveal the heart of an adolescent with frankness and honesty. Like the great writer of fiction, Jane Austen, Anne Frank found in the tidbits of her conflicts with adults, their everyday quarrels, her bodily needs and intimacy, her desire for affection and love, their disagreements over politics, the voice of all humanity. It is for these reasons, that this diary endures among classics and among must reads for our youth.<br /><br />A good companion for this book, also sold on Amazon, is the Anne Frank House Authorized Graphic Biography, written by Sid Jacobson, and illustrated by Ernie Colon, because of the historical background for the anti-Jewish laws, the rise of Hitler and Nazis in Germany and Europe, the mass migration of Jews to other parts of the world, genealogical maps of Anne's family, and a map of the secret annex. It also has a timeline of events at the end of the story. Also, some parts of the diary are narrated in graphic format. I recommend both books together.e appropriate for teenagers and adults as she speaks with wisdom. In sexuality, she advocates for sexual education at a young age. She feels no shame for her periods and openly confesses on January 6, 1944 that she is \\"always looking forward to the time when I'll feel that secret inside me once again.\\" And when she is falling in love with Peter, she announces on February 12, 1944 \\"I think spring is inside me.\\" In matters of love, she does sound more radical when she claims on March 2, 1944 \\"Losing your virtue doesn't matter, as long as you know that for as long as you live you'll have someone at your side who understands you...\\" But the way she reflects on these issues throughout the diary show a desire to balance out her natural teenage impulses with the reasoning of a maturing adolescent, not a rebel without a cause.<br /><br />Anne also talks about her literary ambitions and she does show her knack for writing with skill. There is a tone of irony in an entry subtitled \\"Peeling Potatoes,\\" August 10, 1943. Once you've read this section you'll discover that it is more than about peeling potatoes. A clever story is subtitled \\"Ode to My Fountain Pen: In Memoriam\\" found on the November 11, 1943 entry. It's about the loss of her fountain pen. She even makes the most out of scary situations when she writes about an attempted break-in into the factory where they are hidden as if she were narrating a suspenseful story. In addition, on many occasions she shows us the sensibility of a poet as she connects with nature even within her confinement: \\"As long as you can look fearlessly at the sky, you'll know that you're pure within and will find happiness once more\\" she states on February 23, 1944. Later on, on March 7, 1944, she  claims her right to beauty in the face of misfortune: \\"If you just look for it, you discover more and more happiness and regain your balance. A person who's happy will make others happy; a person who has courage and faith will never die in misery.\\"<br/><br />This does not mean that Anne's diary has nothing to do with the war or with anti-Semtism.

0380807343|5.0|The Novel Coraline is a wonderful story filled with dark fantasy and twisted imaginations. Based in England, this story tells the tale of a small girl named Coraline who doesn't quite fit in with society. She is a loner with a very active imagination. Her once normal life is turned upside down when she finds a bricked up door in the drawing room in her house. This bricked up door turns out to lead into an alternate world where everything seems to be better. When Coraline has a realization that this alternative world really isn't a good place to be, it is too late. Her \\"other mother\\" already has her claws dug into Coralines life and she doesn't plan to let go. She wants Coraline all for herself and will stop at nothing to have her. Coraline must fight against her other mother in order to keep her life, and fight she does.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game its awesome!!! Temple run is addicting.ilove it!!!! :)))) I reccomend it for everyone!!!!!! You'll love it!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I play this game my every free moment love it. +my three year old loves this game also when I'm not playing she is.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is decent. there are better, but every once in a while I like to play this kind of game.
B007SGM084|5.0|An interesting tale of love from the dark side that ultimately results in acceptance and forgiveness for two people in love from two different worlds.  Although there is quite a bit of sex in the story, after a while, I would just skim over those parts to move on with the story of redemption.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout DVD is pretty intense. Jillian Michaels is an excellent trainer--she doesn't sugar coat anything, she pushes you, and she really does have you in mind. She is different from trainers in other videos because she will assist you in technique and she will push you to the limit.<br /><br />The workout itself has three levels, each increasing in intensity and difficulty. Each level has three stages--strength, cardio, and abs and three cycles of each. Each cycle has 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio and 1 minute of abs. And you're moving through the whole thing. This workout is 20 minutes of moving and keeping your heart rate up. There is no resting and there is no break. And Jillian will tell you that many times. She'll say, \\"if you want results, you have to do the work!\\"<br /><br />In short, it is an excellent workout DVD. Of course, using this alone will not help you lose weight quickly. You need to pair it with a healthy eating plan and daily regular exercise. But, use this regularly along with a healthy routine, and you will see results. Definitely worth it!<br /><br />Also, make sure you have hand weights at home. I usually use two to three pound weights and that is good for me.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|like the games. its fun working towards being able to unlock other games and trying to improve your high score
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was engrossed in the 1st book of the Hunger Games and was interested in seeing how Katniss was going to be treated as the winner of the games once she returned home.  The books are easy reading and I enjoyed the twists and turns as we were taken on a rendevous around the districts.  Just like the first book, I was left wanting more.<br /><br />Of course, I got Book 3 too.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's finally on the kindle! Been waiting for this for a while. It works great, and I have no problems with the app.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I don't listen to rap. I don't like it musically or lyrically. I have a few Tupac songs I downloaded because my friend loves him. They're okay. I have Parents Just Don't Understand- DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. Olden days :) I bought a bunch of Eminem CDs because I'd heard a few songs on the radio that I liked okay and he seemed like a decent fellow when I've seen him on TV. Especially when he wears his glasses. I listened to all of them once, put them on my iPod then promptly forgot about all but a few catchy songs scattered on the different CDs. Except for Recovery. It was brilliant. There were a few clunky lyrics here and there about beans and such that I didn't think fit in with the rest of the song. And I skip over Seduction. But the rest of it... Recovery is one of my favorite CDs of all time. Along with MCR's Black Parade, GnR's Appetite for Destruction, Jeff Buckley's Grace, David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, NIN's Pretty Hate Machine and the Hedwig and the Angry Inch Soundtrack. So if you like those maybe you'll like this. I listened to Recovery sometimes 3 times a day for months after I got it. It made me cry. The lyrics are about Eminem's experiences with celebrity and the music industry, and his relationship with Proof mostly, but many of the lyrics I could've written myself about my relationship with my friend and it reminds me so much of him. The lyrics are strong and clever, for the most part. Anyone who can work antidisestablishmentarianism into a song and have it sound natural deserves recognition for his lyrical prowess. I'd love to see what he does with pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. The music is distinct and memorable. None of the songs sound alike. It is musical enough for non-rap fans, while still being rap. The best songs, in order of appearance: Talkin' 2 Myself, Going Through Changes, Not Afraid, No Love, Space Bound, 25 to Life, Almost Famous, Love the Way You Lie and You're Never Over with honorable mentions going to ColdWind Blows and Won't Back Down. The rest are okay, but I often skip over Cinderella Man not because I don't like it but because to me it ruins the flow between the great and sad Space Bound and 25 to Life, and I don't listen to the last untitled song. If it were somewhere else on the album I'd like it but following Love the Way You Lie and You're Never Over it breaks the mood. I hope he continues along this route, I will be looking forward to his next album.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|Great action movie. It had all the type of action I like all packed into one movie. How could you ask for anything better?! I'm glad I purchased this movie. Mark Wahlberg couldn't of been better!! I without a doubt give this movie Five Stars!!
1469984202|5.0|I don't write many book reviews on Amazon (have I written any??) but I feel moved to do so for WOOL. This is a fantastic read!<br /><br />I don't often pay full price for a book (I often buy used) but at roughly $15, this was well worth the asking price. The paper is heavy weight, the font was a good choice and overall it is a classy package.<br /><br />I am very impressed with the storyline, and there is plenty of room for this story to be continued in sequels or even prequels. The pacing was excellent throughout all 5 segments. And best of all...the CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! The characters are REALLY well developed, it almost seems like that is the focus of the book more than the story itself. It all comes together for a perfect blend of those three elements.<br /><br />Well done!! I can't wait for more.

0345803485|1.0|To respond to another review - I agree that it seems like a teenager wrote this book.  The \\"hero\\" is straight out of the movie Pretty Woman.  A rich man who acquires, sells, goes on jaunts because he can, etc.  The \\"heroine\\" (and I hesitate to call her that) is remarkable only in her insecurity.  Ana is a early 20-something virgin with some major insecurity issues.  No one loves her!  No one could possibly want her!  She whispers or mutters every word she says, as if she's ashamed of the words that come out of her own mouth.  That, or she's biting her lip all the time.  And, of course, it's so HOT!<br /><br />There is absolutely no character development in this book.  I'm confident that the only people who purchase the other books in this trilogy are just interested in the smut.  Fool me once, shame on you, E.L. James and NY Times Bestseller List!  I bought this book because I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  Question answered - it's just that today's readers don't want character development or proofread/edited writing.  Today's readers want a superficial storyline with lots of graphic sex (or vampires).<br /><br />Really, a sad commentary about the state of the world that this is a NY Times #1 bestseller.  Save your money and read Tess of the D'Urbervilles for free on your Kindle.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|My comment is the pricing not the writing.  Why is the Kindle price more than the paperback?  Why would I buy this download for more than a hard copy?
B0086700CM|5.0|Really fun! The kids are so occupied by it! It is their favourite now...Exotic, fast, adventurous. Would definitely recommend it.

0871404133|4.0|This book sets out to answer three perennial questions about man's existence: What are we? Where did we come from? And, Where are we going? In the last chapter the author answers his own questions in an uncharacteristically optimistic way, one that is very much contrary to his controversial and mostly pessimistic analysis given throughout the book. He says for instance that: \\"we came out of biology, we are the greatest of all animals and because of our heightened social skills--our special human eusociality--we are being driven to greater cooperation and together will conquer the ills of the world.\\"<br /><br />Synthesizing the latest research in anthropology, evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology, among others, Edward O. Wilson, the father of sociobiology, poses and then attempts to answer for himself, his own questions. And as usual his answers are controversial and are unlikely to go without kicking up the normal academic dust storm.<br /><br />His story, which he admits (and would have been easy to see even if he had not admitted it) has many speculative parts, is essentially this: There is only one creative story of mankind, and it is not the one told to us through religious myths, but the one science is telling us today. This new story of science that is rapidly gaining consensus among academicians, is that it is man's sociality that constitutes the critical event in his evolutionary development. It was what Wilson calls eusociality that made it possible for man to navigate the evolutionary maze and survive to become one of the two co-inheritors of the earth.<br /><br />Not coincidental to Wilson's story, Earth's other conqueror is another parallel eusocial animal, the insect. Wilson, the reader may recall spent the better part of his career studying the behavior of ants.<br /><br />More by the accident of the evolutionary draw, than anything else, and using an entirely different strategy than insects (which depended on robotic instincts rather thancooperative bonding), man, primarily through a series of what Wilson calls six pre-adaptations, has been able to survive, colonize, and now is destroying, the earth.<br /><br />Wilson's six pre-adaptations are: being able to live on the land; having a body size suitable for large-scale brain development; being able to use our hands to fashion tools; switching from plant eating to meat eating animals; controlling fire; developing agriculture; and living in groups where cooperative bonding led to a division of labor. These six pre-adaptations, coupled with the need for advanced intellect and the increased brain size (that resulted from these very same pre-adaptations), according to Wilson, is what ultimately allowed man to thread the needle to survival and eventual to co-domination, with insects, over the earth.<br /><br />However, unlike insects that have evolved slowly enough to co-evolve with their environment, man has evolved so rapidly that the possibility of co-evolution with its environment has left him with fewer limiting controls and thus often have left him at the mercy of his own worse instincts, such as his greed, which currently and inexorably, is leading him to ecological disaster.<br /><br />The centerpiece of the book seems to be Wilson's discussion about the relationship between man, the individual, and, man the group member. Here he notes that man's power to form groups was not a recent invention but is universal within the species, and thus has the clear mark of instinct. Accordingly, people must have tribes, because it gives them an identity, a purpose, and social meaning. Part and parcel to this meaning however is the law of bias governing group membership: to love those within the group and hate those outside it. In a somewhat radical departure from his previous work, the author now claims that it is \\"group selection\\" rather than \\"individual selection\\" that is responsible for man's rapid evolutionary development. However, the value of an individual to a group and vice versa must be weighed against what either could do without the other's contribution. The gap in either direction has been the source of most of human conflict.<br /><br />And while this is no small matter, it pales in comparison to the earlier mentioned unwritten law of tribalism: to hate outsiders and to love insiders. The inherent tendency for group members to blindly adhere to this law constitutes the darker side of human nature. And according to this author, has been responsible for most of the drama of man's cruelty to man. From internecine intra-family squabbles, to cross tribal vendettas, to wars, political struggles and even genocide, it is the unwritten laws of group behavior that continue to constitute the darker side of man's nature, and is responsible for so much sorrow in human existence.<br /><br />Although the author stuck closely to the canons of science in the first half of the book, during the second half, his free-lance speculation seemed to get further and further away from accepted or canonical wisdom. And since he failed to use footnotes in the book, this left the reader with nowhere to turn. Although I read quite a bit of lay materials in the fields which this substance covers, I am by no means an expert or up on the latest research in this fast-moving area. After chapter eight, the book seemed to have veered off its main themes and thus (at least for me) seems to have lost much of its sense of unity and its linear flowing logic. Despite this, there is still enough between the lines for the reader to be able to fashion for himself a reasonably logical and continuing  concluding thread.  Four Stars
B0086700CM|5.0|one of my favriote games for the kindle. fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
1442419814|1.0|I got hooked into the genre with hunger games and divergent.  After reading reviews - I thought Uglies would be a good read.  However, it was horrible.  The characters were shallow and the story line went nowhere.  I could not even finish the book (which is rare since I hate to waste money on things I don't read).  Don't waste your time!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I wish I didn't always have to buy credits to build things!! Overall the game is fun, a mini sim city 3000 in my opinion

B0000BYM3K|4.0|I picked this disc up used from an Amazon seller and gave it three spins yesterday.  It's quite good!  There is some less-than-stellar material here and some repetitive lyrics but the bright spots are worth the effort.  The opening track was especially good, reminding me of the more straight-forward songs from the first two albums with Paul DiAnno.  Overall I'm please with the album and am happy to add it to the late-model Maiden collection.  I have loved the band's music since high school so I'm obviously a bit biased, and I doubt anyone not already into Maiden would be interested in it.  Old-school, hard-core fans might prefer the classic albums (as do I) but if you're willing to give this one a chance you'll find it a worthy entry in the Maiden catalog.
B007SGM084|2.0|It really is a shame the price is ridiculous!!!!! I already went to Walmart and paid a fraction of the price!!!! Why make life complicated for the ones who will support you!!!! It's really no different than gas goudging!!! It really is a shame on you!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is fun and addictive... I cannot stop playing!  The only issue is the occasional lag which causes soul crushing death.  Without that, it'd be a five star game.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is sooo addicting like all I do is play this game! ive played it so much when I close my eyes I see the game haha!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a good game because it's so fast and you get to buy new people to run for points on the game. The game is also challenging because you have to jump over roots and slide under poles.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great bible app,it contains so many different translations,different languages,has audio bible,and alot of other good features. I would recommend it to anyone searching for a bible app
0345803493|1.0|Ok. After several months of reading the first book and trying to slog through this second one...I give up.  I hate to be mean in any reviews but this is literally the worst writing I have ever endured. I don't even CARE how this turns out in book two much less the third and hopefully final book.  Countless reviewers have already capably pointed out the shortcomings so I don't have to reiterate them.  The absolute worst for me was the repeated and ludicrous use of the word \\"smirk\\".  Honestly, who talks like that? I was looking forward to this after all the hype and purchased the books without looking at a review.  I started to think there was something wrong with me...not liking it....finding the sex boring and the romance sappy and more boring.  You can do much better than this series.
B007Z5LBE2|5.0|Another great TV program from the BBC that really need to be watched.  Acting is terrific as to be expected.<br /><br />The horrors of the battle of war were really striking.

B005LAII0I|2.0|This film has some really great moments, but they are sadly overshadowed by bad directing, bad casting, and bad writing.<br /><br />The script involves the use of many modern idioms (i.e.,\\"Let's crash the party\\").  There are also numerous tired Hollywood cliches.  The characters do the most unaccountably and uncharacteristically dumb things time after time.  It becomes difficult to suspend one's disbelief.<br /><br />Many of the characters don't even have names.  They are simply \\"The Prince,\\" or \\"The King.\\"<br /><br />Half of the characters are played by English actors, and have English accents.  The other half are played by American actors, and have American accents.  I'm not sure where this story is set, but maybe Canada?  That's halfway between the US and England, isn't it?  At least culturally?<br /><br />Julia Roberts was a particularly poor choice to play The Queen.  She does not do villainy well.<br /><br />The film also makes some rather bold political statements, considering it is a fairy tale and a family film.  There are numerous references to the poor economic state of the kingdom and to the tendency for greater taxation to deepen the recession.  One character even makes a reference to \\"tax dollars,\\" which is a term that feels completely out of place in a medieval fantasy story.  While the film makes some good points regarding politics and economics, that really isn't what I was looking for in a fairy tale.<br /><br />The film is full of beautiful costumes, sets, hair, makeup, and special effects, but they don't make up for the film's other shortcomings.  Children will probably still enjoy the film, but most adults will likely find it painful to endure.
B00003CXA6|1.0|I had a VHS copy of this movie and thought It would be nice to have a DVD.  However, when the product came, the second disc in the set was boken.  I discovered this past the possible return date so I am stuck with half of the movie.  I am not pleased with Amazon for shipping a defective product and not taking it back.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a very fun puzzle game. The puzzles can be challenging at times. It works great on my Transformer Prime.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a controversial love story, told in a very sensual way, written very well, but if you are skittish about reading erotica, don't read it, or at least, read the 2nd and 3rd books by this author.  She writes very well, very descriptive love scenes, but the basic story is that of a couple deeply, deeply in love with each other.  I was very pleased reading this trilogy, as it turns into just a simple love story of two people who wish to experience great sex!  And what's wrong with that?  At certain times, the story becomes a little \\"soap-opera-ish\\", but it turned out to be just very enjoyable reading.  If you are faint-at-heart, don't bother, but if you are an avid reader and you like exciting and romantic love stories, this is it!!!!
1469984202|5.0|I sometimes read a book and scratch my head wondering firstly how the writer came up with such a story and how they learned to write so well.<br /><br />I think I found out about these books by browsing the best seller lists on Kindle. I don't really read much fiction but read the entire Song of Ice and Fire series which of course isn't finished and won't be for a while.<br /><br />Wool is a fascinating page turner which chooses to keep the focus on two or three main characters. The depth of emotions they experience is gut wrenching and the way they deal with the challenges they face makes this series a must read.<br /><br />I polished off the complete series in about four days and will buy everything else Hugh Howey writes.<br /><br />Paul Browning
030788743X|5.0|If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced sci-fi adventure about virtual reality, you can't go wrong with Ready Player One. Some of the 80's references were a bit much in the beginning, but most of it works in the end I guess. While I'm not a huge fan of videogames (old and new) I very much liked this novel. It had likable characters (Wade's atheist rant towards the beginning cemented my love for him, and it actually made me excited to read more), a fast-paced plot with plenty of twists and turns, and an interesting world (how I wish the OASIS actually existed). If there was one complaint I'd have is that there is a lot of telling vs. showing, but the stuff that was being told was interesting so I didn't mind it that much.<br /><br />Even if you're not a huge fan of the 80's, you'll probably like this novel if you ever wished you could escape from the real world once in a while. I know this novel provided that for me. Hopefully the movie version is just as good, because while reading it I couldn't stop thinking how this novel would make a pretty awesome movie.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

B0018QOIXU|1.0|Adele's 19 and 21 are both horrendous CDs, but 19 is vomit. She's trying to be something she's not- a pop singer. SHE CANNOT SING POP. Her voice is to jazzy for that. She might be good if she sang jazz, and, if she does, I must BEG her not to write her own lyrics, and just cover some old classics, cause her lyrics are mediocre.<br />Adele has established herself as a mainstream \\"popper.\\" Okay Adele, now make 23 (?) a jazz album, and you will be one of my favourite people.<br />I must also take note of the fact that at all stores that sell CDs, Adele's 19 and 21 are still in the \\"New Releases\\" section along with artists that have actually recently released CDs, good artists, too, like Regina Spektor's What We Saw from the Cheap Seats. THAT is REAL music, go listen to the samples on here!

B0086700CM|5.0|This app is addicting!!! It works well and is fun to play. Coins are easy to get and send and I'm getting higher scores each day.

Whoever doesn't own this ap doesn't desire to have fun.

157421327X|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend and took it on vacation with me.  Just a pad of paper and a few pencils and I was set to go.  Loved sitting on a balcony with my morning coffee trying my hand at the tangles.  It didn't take long before I was hooked.  Bought a copy of the book when I got home.  My copy is now vacationing with a friend.  Even my daughter thumbed through and created a beautiful design - first try.  Instead of doodles ripped off a notepad and thrown away - I now have fun tangles.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a very great game. Each game is a new challenge and its a lot of fun and very addicting.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|While this was not great literature, it was great escapism. After the first volume, I wanted to read on but after the second, it became a bit repetitive. All in all, a fun read. While the books are touted as Mom-porn, they are actually quite a bit about family togetherness.
B0086700CM|5.0|Omg its on the kindle fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! its not only on the ipod its on the kindle fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!people who give a one star suck
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Read the whole series & waitng for the next book.<br />There is alot of sexual content. So, not for everyone. It has good story with alot of twist and turns to keep you reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|My son has this on his phone. I played a few times and enjoyed it. Now with it on my kindle I'm totally hooked!! The game appears to be easy but that is a ploy ;)  With a few swipes of your index finger you're done for.<br />I have absolutely no complaints about the game or how it works on the kindle. It works great. Kudos to it's creators.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book and can not wait to read the next book. You read this book with pleasure. My thanks to the author.
0345803485|5.0|I had not heard of this trilogy before my boyfriend introduced it to me when we were in a bookstore during a weekend getaway.  He told me that so many people were talking about how great it is and though I am not usually a fiction reader, I thought I would give it a try.  So glad I did!  It is so completely addicting!  The characters are well defined and what woman wouldn't fall in love with Christian?... I'm still not sure.  It is easy to get lost in trying to figure him out while his relationship with Anastasia evolves.  This is a great story for women who are looking to get lost in another world for several hours.  I have finished book one and can't wait for two and three to arrive!
B0086700CM|5.0|I've waited all my life for this game to come out for the kindle fire and now that I have it I'm going to play it FOREVER!!
B0086700CM|5.0|A fun and addicting game. If you've never heard of it, then play it. I highly recommend this game. It would be even better with different game modes.
B0086700CM|5.0|a long wait but its finally here, i will play this game foreva cuhh love the graphics and i have more space to do the movements
B007IXWKUK|4.0|If she said Jeez one more time or bit her lip again I would have thrown up.  The writing, except for the sex scenes is horrible. Needs a good editor.  Also, the not eating for the heroine seemed to me to be wishful thinking on the part of the author.  That said, the sex scenes are very hot and make the books worth reading. I am not a young woman and I felt more than one  twinge  while reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally .. temple run!  i have been needing this game! for ever! i luv thus game and alll i need now is sims 3 for amazon
B0086700CM|5.0|I thinks its cool how fast and long he can run the guy you starts of with has the same color
B0076D20E8|4.0|Entertaining. Set in the political snake-pit of Elizabethan England, ANONYMOUS speculates on an issue that has for centuries intrigued academics and brilliant minds... who was the author of the plays credited to William Shakespeare?
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Wonderful puzzle game. Whether you call it a \\"Japanese Crossword\\" or a \\"Nonogram\\" the interface is quite nice especially once you figure out you can pinch-zoom. :)  (Might make a good addition to the tutorial or help system, that.)
B005HSL626|5.0|this is an amazing game for people of any age. the juicy fruity game has challenges very fun to try to defeat. with many modes in this game you can experience extreme happiness. this game is genius!
0671646788|4.0|Bought this book after I heard it as one of the recommended books by Kevin Trudeau. The book is great in itself, focuses relentlessly on thinking big and the power of thought and its impact on the self-image portrayed. It has some great examples and really gets the point across. I can guarantee that you will finish this book feeling a lot more motivated with a can-do attitude. The one place where I felt this book lacks is the writing style - it's not very professional, at several places it feels like it was written by a 14-yr old. Another issue is that the author gives so many unending examples of people he personally knows, it gets to be overwhelming at times, and you really start to question how the author can possibly know so many people with such unique situations, each one being pertinent to the book. Kinda makes one question the validity of the anecdotes. Any way, that aside, the book is a a definite must-read. The other book I'm currently reading is \\"See You At The Top\\" - seems much better so far but it is targeting a slightly different audience and has its own flavor of message. Will review it once I am done with it. Grab this one for sure if you are looking to motivate yourself and shed your inhibitions about personal and professional growth.
B003UESJHO|5.0|We say this in the theatre and loved it so decided to make it a permanent part of our collection.  Now we can watch it any time we want.
B004UQ03P2|1.0|We bought these for our MBP 13 and 15 based on the glowing reviews. Sadly, the product is nowhere close in quality as made out by the reviews. The only good thing is that it is easy to install because it doesn't stick to the entire screen, just the edges. But that's about where the pluses end. The film has a severe matte look to it which makes the entire screen pixelated. It adds a matte finish to it, the screen is no longer crisp. To top it all, the  film started coming off in less than a week and now won't stick back up. If this was a $5 product, I could've understood. But at this price, it's basically overpriced crap that I would definitely NOT recommend for the MBPro.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|The hardware here seems to work just fine, but be warned that you will be VERY limited with what you can do with the photos once they're on your device. Want to delete an album? You can't. It's impossible. There is absolutely no way to do it if it wasn't sync'd through iTunes.<br /><br />So, your iPad will fill up with photos from the camera connection kit and you will have two options: reformat your iPad completely or sift through thousands upon thousands of individual photos and delete them one by one. I'm sure if Steve Jobs was still around he would have a solution for us: \\"iPad Full? Just buy a new iPad!\\"<br /><br />Getting photos onto the iPad is great. Getting them off will be your worst nightmare. I'd recommend avoiding the situation altogether and not using an iPad in any way for photo management. I'd recommend using an Android tablet for photo management or shoving red hot needles into your eyeballs both as viable options over trying to use the camera connection kit for anything useful.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that it reads the Bible on audio. For someone that's not an avid reader it really makes it much more enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Strangly, the \\"negative\\" reviews are far more entertaining than the book could ever be; I strongly assume. Let's not dwell on a story of one damaged individual damaging another, we should all take responsibility for our own actions. If we all acted out of a direct reaction to how we have been treated, why, what a mess the World would be in. An abusive relationship is not a love story.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Just as good as 50 Shades Grey and living up to all the reviews the trilogy has received. As with the first book, I found it a little too graphic at times but that was generally evened out with the storyline.
B007L24T52|4.0|The plot kept me thinking in circles and was quite well developed. An awesome list of characters, smoking guns and paper trails! Thank you Baldacci for the book and Amazon for the easy to handle Kindle format! Totally satisfied with the instant delivery!
0345803485|5.0|If it's raw, vulgarity you are desiring, do not buy this book as it is anything but that.  Anyone who thinks some women cannot achieve multiple orgasms \\"at the drop of a hat\\" has never had good sex or, as the case may be, has never given good sex.  The book is what most women need to escape the mundane, \\"wham bam thank you mam\\"  life in which they live.  Yes, the Dom is a bit over the top in wealth, looks, etc., but do you want to read about a poverty stricken, ugly man,with no sex drive?  This is erotica for goodness sakes and erotica it is.  It isn't filth!  It is well written and I have enjoyed sitting and reading with my dictionary by my side so as to define the interesting vocabulary the author uses on occasion.  I also suggest that you order the music mentioned in the book and try some of the wines!  Now, if you don't like the book for it's erotic bent, then I suggest that this book be labeled as \\"Communication 101\\" for MEN.  Men. If you take lessons and master these communication skills - the other skills aren't bad -  from this book, whether rich or poor, handsome or not so handsome, your partner will feel like a queen.  You might find that multiple orgasms are indeed a reality!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have had my eye on this book for about 6 months now.  I read the negative reviews and decided not to read the book based on the reviewers descriptions of Travis and his violence and codependency issues.  But the more and more I heard about it (even negative things - there's no such thing as bad publicity, right?), the more intrigued I was.  I finally decided to give it a try.<br /><br />At first I LOVED this book!  I even posted on my FB wall that I couldn't put it down and it was like Kindle Crack!  Travis' character was so deep and developed and the relationship that was building between him and Abby was so sexy and sweet.  Abby seemed confident without being arrogant and I liked the two of them together as friends.  But then, like many other reviewers have pointed out, things kind of went to hell.  Most people are talking about Travis and how he flies off the handle but what bothered me more than that was Abby and the things she did to him to get him to fly off the handle.  She seemed to like the drama and she would instigate these episodes and I actually felt sorry for Travis because he fell in love with her.  By the end of the book I was wishing for the best for Travis - like getting her out of his life!<br /><br />But the worst thing about Beautiful Disaster was that near the end of the book something very, very tragic happens.  I mean, very bad.  And T&A just kind of swept it under the rug and ran off to Vegas while the rest of the city and maybe even the whole world, were mourning.  Since this was the end of the book I was left with a bitterness about it.<br /><br />But it wasn't all bad.  I still liked the book overall.  The chemistry between them, the sexual tension, was great.  The friendship between Abby and America was very well done, too.  I liked it that they were genuine friends to each other instead of frenemies like most BFF relationships.  I'm definitely glad I read it and I will read more from this author and would love to see more of Travis.Maybe 10 years down the road after he's come to his senses about that rotten Abby and all of the anguish of his youth has turned him into a stunning but brooding man...Yes, please write the 10-year-Pigeonless sequel!!
B00821PEYG|1.0|This is supposed to be about an alien invasion and this whole episode is about a team of 6 survivors that stumble like a bunch of retards into an ambush and get captured by a gang, and about how they FINALLY fumble around and get out of the fix.<br /><br />Such stupid people would no way survive 24 hours in an alien invasion.<br /><br />Hope they improve on this crap.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great read, nice story line, full of action and entertaining. Gives a lot to think. Quite an interesting critic to our system.
B00821OW8K|4.0|The acting is good and the action was too. Aliens got killed which is what I watch this stuff for.<br /><br />If the writers keep it up and don't fluff it down it should be a good series.<br /><br />Hopefully they won't cancel it like they did \\"V\\".
0066620996|5.0|Let's face it, if you own, or are part of a company that has made it through this past recession, we can consider your company decent. Collins team of researches interviews both companies that have met the criterion for transitioning from a good to great company as well as companies that have had temporary greatness and companies that failed in the long term. While this book may be based off of somewhat dated information, it uncovers some of the basic necessities companies need in order to become a better functioning economic entity.<br />I will try to quickly sum up the bulk of the most important points. Collins starts off with stating that a \\"Level 5\\" leader is needed. Emphasizing that most of these leaders come from within the company, these fella's are not celebirtyesque leaders that come in and change the whole system. Rather, many of them are people who come from within the company and have a complete understanding with what the company is about and where it's headed. Then you have to get the right people on board. Simply put, many of the difficulties and problems disappear when you have the right people \\"on the bus\\". Next they confront the truth about the company's direction and what to do about follows. One of his biggest points is that once a company figures out where it needs to go, it slowly builds up momentum, and once the company follows the \\"Hedgehog Concept\\" it will eventually break into greatness.  How to react to technology changes and what not to do is also included.<br />Overall, this book will shed some light on how certain companies are able to \\"make it\\", but it does not go into detail about many of the specifics of how to do these things. While I was reading this book, I was able to relate certain bad habits to companies that keep struggling in becoming great, but mostly that's all the book will do and further researching will be needed to fix these problems. Concisely, I would recommend this book for a beginner/intermediate as it will help yourecognize problems and point you in the right direction.
B00821PGUS|5.0|Since the lows in plot and action in episode 2 and 3 the action really picks up in 4 and this one, 5. Aliens getting offed, people rescued from alien slavery . . . this is what I'm taking about.
B007MAETA8|5.0|This album is the best thing I've heard in years. Some songs I feel I'm listing to pearl jam or Pete yorn or country. I don't know how to describe it maybe mesmerizing. I love it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Honestly, I read the Parsona Rescue because the writer and I are friends from \\"way back\\". I am not much of a sci-fi person but I HAD to continue with the Molly series because his descriptions were so clear that I felt like I had been to these other worlds along with him(I know he MUST have visited these planets himself to be able to describe them so well) and  I became so invested in and connected to the characters he created.<br /><br />I waited a while but finally got the Wool Omnibus after seeing all the awesome reviews and ratings so I had to see what the fuss was about.  Now, you may think I am biased because I know the writer but it could really mean that I am more critical.  Well, I was completely blown away by Hugh's writing talent and his ability to hook me with the first few pages then to keep me reading non-stop till the end.  These books are so perfectly written! It is a sci-fi story but not so much that I had to struggle over the technical jargon that I don't understand. The story progresses at a great pace so that you get to know the characters without getting too lost in the details and, again, his ability to describe a location is so clear that I feel I have lived in that silo with them. (I would personally be in the triple digit levels.) Thank you, Hugh, for such an entertaining story and I can't wait to see the movie.
0385534639|5.0|\\"Something that is wonder and comfort and mystery all together...\\"<br /><br />There is a sub-genre within fantastic literature that has always held a strong appeal for me: the circus. Circus-themed fantasy novels include The Circus of Dr. Lao and Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes. Media versions range from movie versions of those novels to The X-Files, Carnivale, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus and even this year's short-lived series, The Cape. A circus, travelling sideshow, carnival, whatever you call it, it's a refuge for freaks, outcasts and misfits, where the ordinary rules are suspended and anything is possible. Erin Morgenstern makes it the setting for The Night Circus, which is a love story, a magic duel, a mystery. It is one of the best novels I have read in years.<br /><br />\\"It's about how we deal with the repercussions of magic when placed in a public venue, in a world that does not believe in such things.\\"<br /><br />In the nineteenth century, two magicians meet and make a bet: each will train a prot&eacute;g&eacute; in his arts, and the proxies will duel to the death. The chosen venue: a circus. But this is no ordinary circus. It is designed, from the ground up, by a cadre of visionaries, prophets and eccentric geniuses. The proxies - a magician's daughter named Celia and a young orphan who names himself Marco - grow up under the tutelage of their sponsors, learning different approaches to magic. Gradually it emerges that what's going on here is a competition between two schools of magic, a nature versus nurture argument, as it were. Young Celia is trained to use her inborn talents; Marco learns spells and incantations. Both become expert practitioners - and then fall in love. Of course they do. Their merciless sponsors, however, care nothing for their feelings and press them to an impossible conclusion. They come to realize that they cannot even opt out of this \\"game\\", as other lives than their own are at risk. Their solution to the dilemma is believable, unexpected and extraordinary.<br /><br />\\"A kaleidoscope of color, blazing with carmine and coral and canary, so much so that the entire room often appears to be on fire...\\"<br /><br />The trappings of this tale are magnificent. From the opening sentence to the last, Morgenstern shows a fine and subtle hand. Her prose is as delicate and nuanced as the delights the magicians surprise one another with. Imaginative \\"acts\\" go far beyond the dog and pony shows of Ringling Brothers; we are offered eternal flames, stories trapped in bottles, an ice garden, a bubble maze. The circus itself is shrouded in mystery and magic; it comes and goes overnight, without warning. The story winds about like the maze of the circus itself, circles within circles, where time is so fluid that readers are wise to check the date at the beginning of each chapter to locate their place in the story. This convoluted, non-standard narrative sometimes feels force and mannered, but by the time the last chapters approach, the timelines converge in a terrifying conclusion, masterfully handled.<br /><br />\\"After the circus departed, he wrote down every detail he could remember about it so it would not fade in his memory.\\"<br /><br />Morgenstern inserts a few wry bits we easily recognize. One such is the invention of fandom: patrons of the circus seek one another out, correspond with one another, form societies. They begin dressing in distinctive costumes, share backstage gossip, follow the circus itself like Deadheads following the Grateful Dead. It's fun to see this Internet phenomenon play out in 19th century fashion, in hoop skirts, scented stationery and foggy train stations. Morgenstern shows us the circus not just as a showcase for magic (real and otherwise) but as a transformative experience that changes some visitors forever. And like all persons transformed, they seek out others who have shared that experience, the only people who can truly understand. Morgenstern succeedsin drawing us all into that transformative, immersive experience, as she presents us with a taut story combining fantasy, magic, love, death and secrets.<br /><br />\\"Then the circus was gone, vanished as suddenly as it had appeared, like a fleeting dream.\\"<br /><br />The Night Circus scintillates in the mind, reflecting the author's mixed-media orientation as both artist and writer. I was deeply disappointed not to see it nominated for a Hugo award this year; I'm holding out hope for a Nebula.<br /><br />I understand that this is Ms. Morgenstern's first novel. If so, it is a breathtaking debut. May she live long, and prosper.us all into that transformative, immersive experience, as she presents us with a taut story combining fantasy, magic, love, death and secrets.<br /><br />\\"Then the circus was gone, vanished as suddenly as it had appeared, like a fleeting dream.\\"<br /><br />The Night Circus scintillates in the mind, reflecting the author's mixed-media orientation as both artist and writer.

B001O1O71C|4.0|This book, written from a child's point of view, and in his own juvenile language, would be a good story for parents to share with their teen or almost teen children. It is such a personal Holocaust story,with lessons to be learned and discussed.
B000EYK2GE|5.0|I came across some of the material on this CD a few years back somewhere online and was shocked to discover this little gem of a show.  I know some of Carl Perkins' songs, primarily through other people doing covers of his material.  This CD brings together some of the people that have covered his work and obviously the folks that he inspired and was fortunate enough to become friends with for a thoroughly pleasing performance.  I have had this CD for about five years now and I have yet to tire of it!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great and I am so glad that it came available for the Kindle Fire. It is much more fun than on the smart phone.

0345803507|5.0|This story is a sexy modern day love story. Its a page turner from the very start. The twists and turns throughout the entire trilogy are very intriguing. The love between Christian and Anastasia seemed to fly off the page and its as if you could actually feel the genuine love and attraction they have for each other. The message I took from this book was to be open to change and open to things that are beyond what is considered the norm. Christian was able to expose Anastasia to a host of non-sexual and sexual adventures that she would have never experienced had she not been open. Likewise, Anastasia was able to expose Christian to life lessons that he would have never experienced had he not been open to it. Although being open to change and new things can be hard and even a fear for some, as it was for Christian, if you can find the strength to open your heart and mind to it, the reward will exceed all your expectations. He showed her sex, adventure, love, life, and the world. She showed him the strength of a woman, happiness and unconditional love. All three books are an excellent read. Each book in the trilogy is better than the book before it. The love story between the characters was so intense, I read all three books twice within two weeks time because I wanted to feel what Christian and Anastasia were feeling. I wanted more, I didn't want their story to end. Regardless of what the critics say, this book is a love story between an innocent, intelligent, strong young woman and a rich, damaged but loving, and compassionate young man who was aching to be loved. The evolution of the two characters was evident and unexpected.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun and has a wide varity of games for you to play and uses a wide range of skill level
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have to confess, I was drawn to this trilogy after seeing an interview with the author.  The fact that she wrote about sex - a lot of sex! and that she was older intrigued me.<br /><br />Was there too much sex? No, there was too much repetition. Did I enjoy reading about the deviant sex?  I did, but the thing that kept me reading was not the sex but the characters in the book and their story.  Ms. James did a wonderful job of bringing these people to life and made me care about them, hoping the heroine would gather her courage and stand up to the man she loved,and that he would not turn out to be a heel.<br /><br />This trilogy is pretty much an updated version of the once popular paperback romance novels that always showed women baring a lot of bosom and some handsome hunk gripping her to him, but the sex is oh so different.<br /><br />I would recommend this to my friends.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it, great way to kill time! So much fun and does not appear to have any bugs like my htc ego.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Kelley (Adam Brown's wife), Larry (his father) and Janice (his mom) asked Eric Blehm  to write Adam's life story in book form.  They were looking for someone to fulfill Adam's request to share his full testimony if anything happened to him. It was his desire to help others understand what God had done for him and wants to do for them too.  So who is Adam Brown and why would you want to read a book about him?  The first part of the question is easy he was a top-notch American patriot and hero, a Navy Seal, a loving devoted husband, fantastic father, and much more.  I can't answer the second part of the question for you, but I wanted to read `Fearless' because of a short clip the publisher put out about Adam and the book.<br /><br />The book is engaging, captivating, informative, enlightening, heart-warming, and heart-wrenching.  Even the author found the final chapters hard to write and found himself hoping for a different outcome.  A sentiment I shared as a reader starting around chapter seventeen.<br /><br />Mr. Blehm gives background information on Adam's parents and grandparents and gives a fairly detailed account of Adam's life from birth to death.  It shows how he lived his life basically fearlessly with determination and will power, yet with a tender honest bold compassion for others.  It highlights those places in his life where will power and determination failed him and how his faith in and relationship with Jesus allowed him to overcome even his worst failures and become a man of God whose life led others to Jesus too.<br /><br />There was one story shared that Mr. Blehm gave more detail on than I personally wanted to know, it had to do with ants and a dare.  Other than that and some crude language peppered throughout the book, I feel this book is worth reading.<br /><br />Purposes of Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a temporary digital review copy of the book mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

0439023483|1.0|This book doesn't make sense we don't even know the game rules and characters are trouped in some arena which is a forest and they don't do anything accept eating rabbits!!! I have no idea why so many people actually likes this book!-seriously?!?!?  Absolutely hate it.
B0086700CM|5.0|have been waiting for temple run for kindle and was delighted to finally see it on the market!  Its a got to have for the kindle fire, you wont be able to put it down.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is finally the legit version of temple run, not temple rum, temple adventure, etc. This is the real deal.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|No spoilers needed for this review. I LOVED THIS BOOK!<br /><br />I must say that I guessed the punch line a few pages early in Wool 1, but that is not a bad thing. Mr. Howey does a great job of foreshadowing -- so much so that a perceptive reader can occasionally see where he is going, or think they do, though they might not always be right.  Just when you think you have figured out the plot line it twists so violently and expertly that your head is spinning faster than a worn-out part in an old turbine generator.<br /><br />I could write pages of teasing praise for this book, but you would spend your time better by reading the book instead. 5 Stars from me, for whatever that is worth. Hugh's writing skill and imagination create a simply brilliant read. Bravo and encore!
B0086700CM|5.0|I luv this game so much because its so addictive. and I love collecting coins. but my fav. part are the ressirection wings.  when u die u come back up and start again
B005LAIHSG|4.0|\\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" is visually extraordinary right from the start. Scenes featuring snow are always more memorable. Maybe its due to its lack of color or the way the snow seems to be falling so rapidly and yet so slowly at the same time, but \\"Snow White\\" plays this up on more than one occasion. Its $170 million budget is tossed around constantly with nearly every time Ravenna (Charlize Theron) is on screen or when her dark army is struck with something and shatters. The Mirror Man in Ravenna's mirror is also extremely impressive.<br /><br />The cast is extremely solid. Charlize Theron does seem to over do it at times, but is mostly just extremely passionate about her goals, quick tempered, and borderline insane. Chris Hemsworth puts on a pretty decent Scottish accent as The Hunstman isn't a completely different spin on the characters we're used to seeing Hemsworth play, but adds just enough (being a drunk and completely miserable) to make it seem slightly different. The dwarves may be what saves the entire film though. They're both technically useful and provide enough comic relief from the grim tale that's being told to make the film way better than it should be.<br /><br />The big issue though is that \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" feels like it borrows from a lot of movies you already love. The most obvious one being that the movie evolves into feeling like a junior or lite version of \\"The Hobbit\\" due later this year. The most impressive visual sequence is when the characters enter the dark forest. That entire sequence feels like it's pulled directly out of \\"Princess Mononoke.\\" While Kristen Stewart is more than likely not on everyone's list of favorite actresses, she's actually pretty okay here. It's difficult to argue with only seeing rabbit teeth whenever she's on screen though.<br /><br />The score is a lot like the movie, as well. There are moments of brilliance, but it seems to get overzealous at times and collapses on itself. What's odd is that the movie seems to cater to Bob Hoskins character of Muir. He's always got something to say about the princess and his introduction is stretched out the longest. When Snow White finally heads off to deal with Ravenna, the camera zooms in on Muir just so he can say, \\"Farewell, princess!\\" It just seemed very bizarre and out of place at times. Bob Hoskins is awesome, but taking the time to hear what Muir had to say so often didn't always fit with what was going on.<br /><br />\\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" has style dripping from every frame of celluloid and features incredible imagery. The performances are mostly very entertaining, the score is fairly satisfying, and its special effects are just extremely well done and pure bliss for your eyes. The way the movie borrows from so many beloved franchises though and its rather bittersweet ending threw a monkey wrench into the works of fully enjoying of what this could have been. Nevertheless, \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" is delightful popcorn entertainment.he movie seems to cater to Bob Hoskins character of Muir.

B0086700CM|5.0|man! This game is the total package!  I love it!  When I got it I played for 2 hours! My parents where mad at me!  Anyways: I highly recommend this awesome game.  Total fun for the whole family. My dad tryed to play and we laughed for a long time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A great app. All people should give five minutes to reading the Bible every day<br /> It makes the day go better and makes you a better person. I know from experience the truth in this. This app makes it very easy to spend time with the Bible. Try it because it is true.
B007FH9GT2|4.0|This is a great movie, but not in my humble opinion as good as the original Swedish film.  However do not rent it with a ROKU streaming device if you need subtitles (captions) as Amazon does not provide captions.  At least not on this movie.  I don't know about other movies (and won't rent any others to find out.)
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Very stunning, and the best Phantom and Christine I have ever seen or heard! I have seen this musical three times on stage, and this 25th Anniverary DVD does the Musical and Andrew Lloyd Webber every bit of justice!
B0086700CM|5.0|finally ive been waiting forever for temple run most of the apps on kindle fire are kind of boring. thank you Imangi Studios for letting us get to play Temple Run!

Very User friendly....can't go wrong with this app!!!!!

B007V5CF5K|4.0|I have to say this is one of my favorite hidden object / puzzle games, great implementation. Graphics are fine, I played a demo on my mac, glad it came out on my tablet. pretty fun.
B004LROUNG|1.0|This latest work by John Grisham is, in a word, boring.  Nothing about the story is compelling.  The characters, and all of the images painted around the characters, are tired cliches.  There are NO surprises (everything is predictable) and the only reason I could find for completing the drudgery of reading this story was my own ethic that I complete what I start. Even when it is, as here, painful. If you are looking for a story with even an iota of freshness, forego this purchase and read something (or anything) else.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game but it you know like pause for a .0001 second then I die.. on a apple iphone it goes smoothly! Please try to make it go smoother!
B0073PPKNM|1.0|WOW! WAITED FOR ALONG TIME TO HEAR AGAIN FROM MELODY, AND WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!<br />BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IS IN THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE RECORDING OR PRESSING OF THIS DISC. I PURCHASE CDS BECAUSE OF INFERIOR QUALITY OF MP3'S, BUT THIS DISC HAS ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS .....SNAPS, POPS AND GRAINY SOUNDS. WHAT'S UP WITH TRACK #11? CD STATES TRACK #11 IS 4 MINUETS AND AT ABOUT 15 MINUETS (11 MINUETS AFTER CD HAS ENDED) A BELL STARTS RINGING AND ALOT OF JUNK BEGINS, AND AGAIN WITH ALL KINDS OF ELECTRONIC SNAPS & POPS .....??????<br />I AM RETURNING THIS CD FOR A FULL REFUND!
0425241505|3.0|I broke my foot not too long ago and as a result, I have a lot more time on my hands because I can't drive anywhere. So I've been reading books like they're going out of style. This one kept popping up on my \\"recommendations\\" list and I liked the cover so I figured, what the heck. I was also impressed by the positive reviews and that it garnered a \\"top romance pick\\" for 2011 via Amazon.<br /><br />Was this book nearly as good as I'd expected? Not really. I'll likely irk many loyal Elder Race readers with this review but as much as I wanted to love this book, I only liked it...some of the time.<br /><br />Fact is, while the premise was pretty unique and the humor was crisp and laugh-out-loud funny at times, I found the plot WAAAAAAY too predictable to the point where I just kept skimming to the good parts. Aside from the cool and often unique fantasy elements, this book had all the usual tropes of an urban fantasy romance including (but not limited to): alpha male hero with a heart of gold; strong, independent, but secretly wanting to be taken care, of heroine; a BIG SECRET harbored by the heroine which makes her even more bad-ass yet rare, precious to the hero; buddy/sidekicks who at first resent the heroine for intruding on their bromance with the hero only to change their minds when she proves herself worthy of their respect with witty dialog and excellent fighting skills; brand new supernatural BFF to heroine who helps \\"normalize\\" her brave, new world; nasty bad guy who seems rather inept and clueless at times; and strong, ambiguous female sidekick to hero who remains unimpressed by heroine and may or may not harbor a secret thing for the hero and/or vulnerable and soft inner core (TBD).<br /><br />Bottom line? While this book had a lot going for it, it fell flat to me. Don't get me wrong, this wasn't a bad book...but it didn't really bring anything new to the UF romance party. I think it'd make a great beach read....but it's not one that will stick with the reader long after it gets put down.er long after it gets put down.
B005LAIGSM|3.0|THE VOW claims to be \\"inspired by true events\\" which usually means the basic premise is based on fact and the rest if all fiction. It is an interesting concept. A desperately in love couple is split apart after a tragic accident erases the past 5 years of the memory of the wife. Her husband is now a complete stranger. Her feelings are now with the ex-finance she dumped years ago. Time has stood still and everything that has happened in the past 5 years is no longer part of her memory or reality. Her family is back in her life as there is no memory of the rift that caused her to break all contact with them.<br /><br />THE VOW certainly has good intentions even though something is lost along the way. Rachel McAdams as Paige is lovely as always and Channing Tatum provides the beefcake. They both try but the chemistry between them is not so strong. It is interesting to follow Paige's journey into a life she does not remember and her looking at pictures and videos that must seem totally alien. The story could have delved deeper into this journey.<br /><br />Sam Neill and Jessica Lange are in the supporting roles of Paige's parents. It was sad to see how time has not been good to the lovely Jessica Lange who looks so much older than her \\"husband\\" Sam Neill. Paige returns to her parents' home since there is no memory of why she left and broke all contact with them and including her sister. She even broke contact with her sister apparently for no reason. When we learn the reason for the rift, it is anti-climatic. Is that all? That is the reason she left her family and broke all contact? It seems like the author could have found a more compelling reason.<br /><br />At the end there is a brief reference to the couple who inspired this story. I was hoping there would be a bonus feature in the extras to tell more about this couple.<br /><br />THE VOW is an OK movie. I was hoping for much more but it wasn't a total disappointment. A good film if you need a bit of light entertainment.ment.

B007SGM084|5.0|Oh My, this series is incredible, what else can I say. It captivated me from the first page. As the story line progressed you get immersed into it. You read because you want to know the history of what created this man. You also want to know that no matter what happens in your life that everyone is capable of loving and being loved. No one is perfect we all have flaws.
B0086700CM|5.0|get this game it is probably one of the best games on amazon. I rate this game five stars, if you had to get one game get this.
B0086700CM|3.0|works great on kindle fire.  i enjoy this game ... fun  ..good time waster.  good graphics.  plus it was free.  gotta love free.
B0086700CM|5.0|the best game ever!!! and its so addicting even better because its free.you have to get it and works great on kindle fire!
B007L96SI6|5.0|I love this CD! I pre-ordered it, so I got it the day it was released. I've been listening to it ever since. I love Haley's voice since the day I heard her on American Idol.  I think the songs are wonderful on here and I like them all (2, 3, 7, and 8 are my favorites).  I'm a little disappointed I didn't get the deluxe version, but I didn't know there was going to be one. Oh well, I'm sure I will purchase down the road when it becomes more available.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Really I can't even say enough wonderful things about these 3 books. Once I started with 50 shades of grey I didn't stop reading for a week until I had finished all of them. They are really just a beautiful, wonderfully written love story that goes above and beyond anything I have ever read before. I have recommended them to everyone I know.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is the best game ever I've been waiting for his to come out for like ever.  And its FREE!
0062082353|5.0|This is the first book I have ever read on my own from cover to cover without a break. Chris Kyle is a friggin bad ass & he had me laughing out loud a many points in the book. Easy read & he writes the way he would speak. Loved it, even bought a Craft International t-shirt from his company.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is AMAZINGLY AWESOME!!!!! SOOO addictive to play!! I love it a lot!!!!!!!! SOMETIMES you can mess up but mostly you just keep running, jumping, and ducking!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I was shocked by the graphics on the kindle they r so real. the its just awesomeeeeeeeee! I recomend u get this! !! especially for kindle fire owners
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is fantastic. Got it on the free app, and was very impressed with how rewarding it is. It can be very challenging, but never frustratingly so.
B00845PT18|1.0|This was nothing like the first movie. It is meant more as a kids movie. The dark feel the first movie had is completely gone. For some reason they decided to make the sequel \\"fun loving\\" instead of the soul killer Ghost Rider really is. Just plain out disappointing.
B005LAIIS0|1.0|I usually don't buy blu-rays without having seen the movie first but because I'm a fan of Liam Neeson's movies, I took a chance- big mistake.  If you have even the slightest knowledge about wolves or winter survival you'll be irritated by how pointlessly inaccurate this movie is.  I say pointlessly because there was room for a good movie here if they'd have used some realism.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|CrossMe is the perfect puzzle game. I love numbers and thinking games. Some are easy some are tricky but I love them all. My only suggestion is for the harder ones maybe be able to earn hints. It's only a suggestion though. Definitely wont keep me from playing.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read this book a couple of weeks ago, and I can't stop thinking about it.  Excellent story- a terrific \\"yarn.\\"  When I read the ending, I had to go back over it about three times because I just wasn't finished with it yet.  The ending was thought provoking in a way that most fiction is not.  The author provides the reader with a choice really, and that's a lot of the fun of the book.<br /><br />Much of the story is somewhat grizzly and gruesome, but it makes sense in this context.  That said, it's probably not for the squeamish.  But the imaginative story makes it all worthwhile.
030746363X|5.0|I wish I found this book earlier. I love the author's style of writing. I didn't read every chapter, but I read most of it. The book got me eating better, exercising more effectively and I feel much better. Even my knee (had surgery a while ago) feels better. I highly recommend it for everyone.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|Well, I really wanted to like this movie because of the MA star Gina Carano. She steams up the Octagon with her true fighting skills, but unfortunately MA stars have a hard time making the transition to acting. You would think that with Ewan McGregor that the movie would have some real acting to beef up the other poor acting, but, not so much. It's seemed that the bad acting bug was contagious. The method in which the story line progresses is also bad. I hope that Ms Carano a) does not come hunt me down for this review and b) get turned off with this experience (first movie). I would hope she takes some acting lessons and band together with a better director. I would say watch the movie for some eye candy but it's so bad it's just not worth it, I would say watch one of her real MA fights instead.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was addicted the minute I downloaded it!!! I challenge my friends to beat my highscore all the time. I was very impressed. no other app like it!!!
1423101472|5.0|Great read and end to the series. Got my book as soon as it was out for my daughter. The next series is pretty good ad well. Highly recommend if you want your kids away from vampire suckers or hungry kids lol

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have Evernote on everything. My entire vacation to Scotland was organized using Evernote (and what a logistical nightmare), and it is going with me on said vacation on my iphone and my Kindle Fire.  The most useful item I have ever installed on anything.  I hold receipts, articles, webpages for future use, notes to myself, drafts of writings, you name it...  This just isn't an app.  It's a necessity.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun.it is so popular.I love it.u have to get it.if u hate it then ur so stupid.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is en extremely well-written book with lots of action. It starts off with just 1 story, then introduces another at a later part in the book, and makes the 2 stories come together in a climactic action-filled explosion of awesomeness. That's the only way I can describe it. :)
0345803485|4.0|I absolutely loved reading this trilogy!  I need MORE of it!  These books have been my early morning, afternoon, evening and late night snack as I slowly read each one over the past 3 weeks...taking my time daydreaming in betwen paragraphs and dialogue about the sex scenes and Googling images of actors/actresses of my choice to play Anastasia and Christian...definitely I choose ALEXANDRA DADDARIO & HENRY CAVILL :)<br /><br />I miss it and long for more of every character.  Too, there are some parts of the books left unexplained.  Such as the incident when Ana and Elliot were in the garage in Aspen right before Kate walked in.  Did anyone else think he was hitting on her?  Then there's Ethan and Mia's relationship...??? Also, how did Linc and Jack Hyde know each other? Hmmm?....I just need MORE!!!<br /><br />That's all for now (lol)...until the next book comes along!<br /><br />Thanks E.L.J. Nice Treat!
B0086700CM|5.0|Its amazing, I have it for the kindle fire and HTC EVO. my phone usually lags on the Google play version however this is not the case with Amazons version.
B0086700CM|5.0|1 word just to describe this whole entire game and if u don't like it what kind of mental issues do u have?!?! this game is awesome and...<br /><br />BOSS
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie Underwood music never disappoints.  I love every song on the album....as I do with all her albums.  Great work.
0345803485|2.0|first i heard a radio host talk about the book; reading a few excerpts aloud.  (*interesting)<br /><br />then, a few of my eBook Reader friends downloaded it from Amazon.  they immediately downloaded the 2nd and 3rd books and finished them in a weekend.  (** intriguing)<br /><br />many friends read the book and were talking about it.  (*hmmm)<br /><br />a friend offered to give me her book as she was heading to the used book store to sell it.  (yay!  free book!)<br /><br />started reading.  how can a book so popular have such an annoying writing style?  (maybe i just need to get used to it.)  continued reading.  Christian's interest in Ana was scintillating at first, but then, moved into the snore section.  yes, i understand they are attracted to each other.  yes, they enjoy even just touching hands.  yes, they are both very attractive.  yes, they are a good sexual match.  after finishing a different book of the erotica/romance genre, i started on this one.  my previous read had me racing after my husband.  i made him nervous with my interest.  this book got me interested in chasing my husband so i could experience something more titillating than what is described by this author.<br /><br />how can a story that is essentially only about sex between a dominant and a submissive be this boring?  shouldn't it be hot?  shouldn't it be steamy?  shouldn't it make me hang on every word of the story?  i skimmed along, hoping for some good parts.  there were a few, but not enough to command such a nationwide interest.<br /><br />i hope the author finds a more skilled editor, and professionals who can help her use her story ideas in a more polished way for any future work she hopes to publish.  but as her work was so celebrated here in the u.s., the land of all things mediocre, i won't hold my breath.  (which the characters did an awful lot.)
B005P37JYM|5.0|I just recently watched PJ20, the Pearl Jam Documentary by Cameron Crowe. It got me excited about PJ again. I listened to my entire Pearl Jam collection chronologically. And it hit me, this truly is the best PJ album since Vs. For PJ fans and non-fans alike, it's just a great rock album.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love that its now on the kindle fire! I used to play it on my phone but know its on a bigger screen and it seems easier to play!
B001UV4XFG|3.0|Still not a great movie compared to the book, but at least there's finally some emotion and a little chemistry among the main characters.  Fight scenes are good, but not great.  It seems this movie followed the book more closely than Twilight and New Moon did, but that's not saying much.  Unfortunately a book like this just doesn't translate well to a 2 hour movie.  Continue to prefer the books over the movies by a wide margin.  Go read a book!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome its addicting and fun to run and jump.I play it all the time its my favorite game.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is an addicting, children friendly game!!!! I have this game on my kindle fire, phone, ipod and my ipad!!!! I love this game and I  would recomand this for you!! I hope tu love it as much I as I do!! Have fun! ! :)
B007L3BMGA|1.0|this book is a lot like the media driven popularity of tattoo girl.  poorly written.  throw in the decadence and it becomes a fav.  this new fad of writing is old for people that actually enjoy a well written story.
0316044695|5.0|Anyone who gives Marcus less then 5 stars is not a very patriotic person. This book is not about the writing but about the story of a group of SEALs that fought with all they had for our country. This is an AMAZING story of brave men who love their country!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and I have had no promblems with glitches at all. it is a great free app that you need to try. so much fun
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had not heard of this book until watching the Today Show on a day off from work.  Wow!  I'm so glad I missed work that day!  I tried a sample on my Kindle and I had to buy it!  I have never read a book that got into BDSM so I was quite intrigued as to what it was all about.  This story consumed me!  I could not put it down!  I found myself reading it every free minute I had.  The characters are so real, with Anastasia narrating it, I felt like I knew her.  Christian Grey is someone you find yourself thinking about over and over again.  This book was so addicting and so hot! Before I even finished the first book, I was purchasing the second. I have now read all three and am re-reading them, which is something I have never done!  I highly recommend this book!
B0058YPG2K|5.0|I love this show because this can happen to anyone, I have stopped watching any other ridiculously stupid TV shows because this is the best one I have ever seen.<br />Too bad I can't give it 6 starts!!!<br /><br />I highly recommended to everyone I know...
B0086700CM|5.0|this game has taken forever to get to kindle fire and its finally here! it is a very addictive game AWESOME too?
B003B02OOG|3.0|It was good...but not that good.  I found that some of the stories were not really that interesting enough to keep my interest going.
B007C94XG4|4.0|My son really enjoys Alvin and the Chipmunks.  The movie is child friendly and neat.  The other two are not available yet on Amazon which is unfortunate for now.  Great movie.
B006Z7Z3S6|1.0|By far the dumbest storyline I have ever seen. I do not care that the movie is suppose to be a different genre because the underlying theme of the movie is dumb people. More specifically,  if the characters in the movie were rational, even by horror movie standards, this movie would have lasted exactly 7 minutes. For example, if I know that a hotel is haunted and I hear a voice, I would not think it is my friend calling me, I also would not then decide to go in the basement where the ghost lives, which I also know, thinking that my friend will be there.<br />Having that said, there is literately no twists, and zero complexity to the story.<br /><br />Do not watch this movie,or if you do make sure your playing chess, or poker, or backgammon at the same time. Moreover, do not waste a great Friday night, as I just did, watching this movie.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Draw Something is a very enjoyable, fun game! I love to draw, so this game is a lot of fun for me. This game deserves 4 stars for its good quality and unique choices to draw, yet sometimes the game closes on its own, and that annoys me. Besides that,  I believe that Draw Something is an enjoyablem addicting game!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy game's like this. it can really pass the time. it has some awesome graphics. I enjoy creating my own village

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This totally delightful Woody Allen comedy concerns an American writer, Gil, visiting Paris with his insufferable fianc&eacute;e and her bourgeois parents. It's a time travel fantasy in which at midnight, while walking alone, Gil is magically transported back to his favorite historical era, the literary and artistic world of Paris in the 1920s, where he parties with F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole and Linda Porter, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, Pablo Picasso, Savador Dali, Man Ray, Josephine Baker, Djuna Barnes, T.S. Eliot, and others, including Picasso's then current mistress and model, Adriana. He finds himself falling for the beautiful Adriana. Unfortunately, she has a favorite historical era as well, one different from his own. It's the Belle Epoque. Can the couple ever find happiness if he longs to escape the 21st Century for the 1920s while she dreams of escaping the 1920s to go back to Maxim's of the 1890s? The movie is chock full of inside jokes, my favorite being Gil's suggestion to a puzzled Luis Bu&ntilde;uel that he should one day make a movie. Then Gil goes on to describe the plot of \\"The Exterminating Angel,\\" which Bu&ntilde;uel would actually make in 1962.

B0067RQYNW|4.0|I know it says that you only get a 15 day trial, but I've been able to use Microsoft Word to create and edit documents for over a month!<br /><br />I give it 4 stars because I am unsure of how to access/create PowerPoints and Excel sheets.<br /><br />But I only downloaded it for MS Word, so I'm impressed :)
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game i've been waiting for this game for a long time it is better then the iphone versoin just because its on a bigger screen now time to wait for minecraft pocket edition!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love it best free app i ever bought. Totally worth the room taken, if u dont have it buy it!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I first played this game on my friend's Ipod and I fell in love with it. Then, as soon as I could, I downloaded it on my kindle fire. This is my favorite game ever!!!! I think everyone should download it! It's way too good to pass up!!!! :D
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is an addictive game. I have been waiting forever for this game to come out on my Kindle Fire.
0307592731|5.0|This book is great!  Maybe because I am a backpacker, live in the Mojave Desert and am familiar with areas that she hiked through, I could relate to the book a bit, but the most captivating part of this book is her personal experiences that led her to the PCT and the grounding that came from the hike.  I highly recommend this book! I couldn't put it down!
B0086700CM|4.0|Perfect for a quick, one-handed game during a subway ride,  between classes, at lunch,  etc. the &quot;purchases&quot; add a Nice replay value too.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I have a tablet that runs on 4.0 ice cream sandwich and whenever I start it up it shows the loading screen for 10 seconds and then it flashes and says &quot;loading feint&quot; but instantly goes BACK to the loading screen and no matter what I do it always does it help?
B0086700CM|5.0|Yay the game is here. I was dying for this game to come out on the Kindle Fire. My big sister has this game on her ipod touch and now I don't have to ask her to play. I'm super happy now. Get this game! :)
B005MYWZIO|5.0|Wow heard the song I'm getting ready on The Spectrum on satellite radio and was blown away by this short song.Looked up the LP (yes VINYL folks) and bought it from Sound direct, and have to tell you this man has it all, I can not even place him somewhere? Percy Sledge? 50's? 60? hell who cares , It did to me what an album USED to do FEEL! Radio needs this man, great R&B the way it was intended, soulful,blues, jazz? like I said you HAVE to give it a listen, download at Amazon for 5.00 bucks, the most enjoyable u will spend on music!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very unique game. Can't stop playing it. Game play keeps changing each time you start so you can't predict what's coming next. Best of all this game is FREE!<br />Thanks! ! !
B004L35GAQ|5.0|This cd is great! AWOLnation is my new band of choice. Love these guys! Sail is my favorite track on this cd so far! Listen and love!
0451205766|5.0|The Godfather is the Grandaddy of all mafia movies that followed. It was filled with remarkable characters, rich in color, in story, and in family history. Puzo is a master story teller, weaving in and around family loyalty. violence, the entertaiment industry, and love mixed with revenge at all costs. Not enough could be said. The unbelievable movie could not have been made simply by a screenwriter starting the story from scratch!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting a long for this game forever and it is finally here!!!!!!!!!! OMG It is so fun
B000002LND|5.0|My niece had asked me to see if I could find this for her.  She couldn't believe the swiftness of delivery and clarity of the product.  She is constantly listening to it (she's in 40's) I probably will have to order again. At least I'll know where to go.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is loads of fun. It is very addicting I would recommend this app to everyone but sometimes I try to turn and it wont turn.  that is so annoying but over all it is a splendid app.
0345535421|5.0|The book is indeed about 1000 pages, and can be a little slow at times. But is an amazing read and though I say it is slow at times, this does not take away from the impressive read at all, and in fact enhances it with showing how war can indeed be slow at times. George R.R. Martin is one of my favorite authors in he can really get the realistic fantasy aspect right as their are indeed fantasy elements such as Dragons and magic, their is a certain realism to his books, the characters and the situations portrayed. With each page I find myself more engrossed in his series can't wait to read the next book.
B007N0REX6|5.0|i love this album! slash sounds amazing and so does myles kennedy. very good combination. i recommend for any slash fans and kennedy fans!
B007SGM084|5.0|FREAKING AWSOME!  Couldn't put it down. Had all three read in less than a wk.  I highly recommend this set.  For a first time author, she hits a home run!  Get it NOW!!
B0055V6EZE|4.0|The music and musicians are first-rate. I defy you NOT to tap something during Swanee River. Most of the songs and their arrangements are not conducive to singing but Laurie sings anyway. It's still a great CD.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|it gets frozen. hard to get out of and just to frustrating<br />it is to hard to end games and does not always match the right letters for the right drawings
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so excited when I saw that Temple Run was available for the Kindle Fire! I have it on my iPod and I'm super addicted!
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome.  awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome I think that's allni got to say about that game.  its awesome
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|The story regarding the snowman was well written and had many unexpected twist. Harry Hole is a good investigator and held the readers interest as he tried to determine exactly who the snowman was. Good plot development and only at the end did the story become somewhat predictable. If you are not looking for perfection in an investigator then Harry Hole is your man. I truly enjoyed the novel.
0385344228|1.0|***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />I am not sure how this book gets such good reviews.  The author William Landay writes this book in such an odd way.  First he starts out with Loguidice interviewing Andy Barber who is a witness before the grand jury and Landay gives us all the information that he is going to flashback and tell us everything once again in a different way, this just draws it out.  He also tends to go on and on and on and on and on and on and on about a whole lot of nothing just seemingly to fill his book.  So to recap he goes over the case two different ways and talks about a lot of nothing, so its obvious he only had enough for a short story but filled it to get a novel.<br /><br />He never solves anything in this book.  He has Jacob on trial which is dismissed as Patz commits suicide and leaves a note saying he did it but then goes on that it Father O'leary killed him and made him sign a note and that Bloody Billy Barber MAY have put him up to it.  He ends the book with Andy Barber on the stand once again being questioned by Loguidice whom a few chapters earlier left the DA's office and went to Boston....hmmmmm(MISTAKES LIKE THESE ALL THROUGH THE BOOK)  Anyways he is questioning him about his wife possibly murdering their son Jacob via a car accident.<br /><br />1. Did Jacob kill Ben Rifkin or Hope - Neither answered conclusively<br />2. Did Patz kill Ben Rifkin and commit Suicide or was he murdered and forced to sign a confession - None of the above are answered conclusively!!<br />3. Did Billy Barber put Father O'Leary up to watching Andy Barber and Killing Patz IF Patz was murdered - No conclusive answers<br />4. Did Laurie Barber kill Jacob via car crash or was it just a horrific accident which may have been caused by a medical condition - No Conclusive Answers<br /><br />In conclusion: This is a long unnecessarily drawn out open ended piece of garbage with no answers or conclusions to anything that happens in this terrible book.  This book does not hold your interest, took me a while to read this as it gets boring reading a bunch of filler that has nothing to do with anything and repeating himself saying the same stuff.<br /><br />Recommendation: Stay far away from this book!!!
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I would say this game is very fun to play and I enjoyed playing it but it is about kamacozes and that remindes me and remindes god of kamacoxe airplanes and it has eliens which are conditioning for the antichrist they are trying to tell us that eliens are real just youtube eliens!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire the way you like it. The ad you see as you start game is not obnoxious and it doesn't nag you mid game. The touch features work well and it has auto-complete for when it's obvious you have won.  My kids enjoy the option of choosing to be dealt a winning hand.  One of the better free apps out there.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|Dear God, this was written by a NY Times best seller???<br />Between the annoying repeats, typos, misspellings, exclamation points, TSTL characters and out of the blue plot twists (with NO conclusions)... an elementary student could have done a better job.<br /><br />This story could have been told in half the pages, if you remove the fluff and repeats. I was determined to keep reading, no matter how painful, in order to understand the rave reviews. It never happened.<br /><br />Save your money, folks. I wished that I had.
B00828JCI8|1.0|Poorly Written. Contrived. Not Funny. Excessive Laugh Track. Terrible, just terrible. An all-around awful show. Don't waste your life on this trash.
0802473156|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my cousin a couple years ago.  I since passed it on to a relative that was about to be engaged and it greatly helped her relationship.  I purchased this copy and 2 others for my sister, her husband, and my significant other.  Its just a very simple straightforward way of looking at relationships.  I have even applied these principles to my non-romantic relationships.<br /><br />Also, the book arrived quickly and in great condition.
B007ORVC36|5.0|I agree that Amazon's Instant Video picture quality is at times in this series bad, and it is very annoying having to reconnect three quarters' through each of the episodes.  I bought them all, though, because this show is so very good and I have no choice if we want to see them as soon as possible; but Amazon should charge one quarter the price or fix that.<br /><br />Stan's sailor cousin's response to Bert and Abe's war conversation at the party was one of the very best lines in the Mad Men series; his expression so poignant.  I think Episode 1 of Season 5 with the civil rights' theme; the people in the waiting room at the end, was every bit the quality we have come to expect from past seasons.<br /><br />The music is one of the most dramatic elements of Mad Men.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have to say the first chapter was hard to get my attention. I thought this was going to be just another ok read. I was wrong. I found myself not being able to focus on anything else if I put this book down wondering what was going to happen next. So I read it in a day.<br /><br />The strange events that would never happen in a normal life somehow brought the main characters Travis and Abby on a whirlwind of events which made them realize there absolute need for each other. Although I have to admit, some of the actions of both seemed a little outlandish and strange, it just gave the suspense of how these two were going to work things out. In the end, I was pleased and realize how intense this book actually was.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|family amusement that's simple to use whether you are a gadget guru or a novice- the games are simple enough to use yet more challenging as you go.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad that Temple Run finally cam out for Kindle Fire. It works really well with Kindly Fire and is the Temple Run that we all know and love.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run! It is way addicting. I play almost every free second that I have. Give it a try!!
B007MAETA8|3.0|I was hoping for more but this just OK.  Rolling Stone review and past CDs got my expectation too high.
0385339100|4.0|I thought I had read all the John Grisham books and then I found this one from 1997 on a remote book shelf. It is actually one of the best. I read it nearly without stopping due to several delayed flights.<br /><br />The story is riveting as Patrick has pulled off the big thing we all dream about. He fakes his death and disappears with all the money and the girl. During his years away in Brazil he concocts the perfect plan to get out of trouble back home and keep enough money to satisfy anyone. Then in a great second act, Grisham shows us his true skill as it turns out nobody is who we thought they were and the most trusted is the least trustworthy.<br /><br />I am not an attorney so I dont know if things could really play out this way but it is all very well told.  We see the rivalry between the various government agencies leading to Patrick's winning when it all started out so hopeless.  Patrick's body was originally thought to have been someone he murdered, then it turns out to have a reasonably happy ending based on a story of some unusual friendships.  For comic relief we have Patrick's ex-wife and her no-good long-time boyfriend. It turns out that Patrick married a materialistic and un-trustworthy woman but things even turn out okay for her, mostly due to Patrick's good heart and interest in the child. The other attorneys in Patrick's firm are off the charts crooks and criminals. Patrick's plan rolls them up nicely in a web of indictments as revenge for their cutting him out of their earlier spoils of crime.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game and it really entertains me!<br />I always like to play the winning deals!!<br />Very, very fun!!!
B001MVYUPC|5.0|This is by far the best movie I have ever seen. The history and details of it are extremely accurate except a few things that were wrong but what can you say, hollywood isn't ev.en perfect
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is super fun and addictive. I've had it a few days and played over 500 games. no problems with it yet!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|when i first saw this game i thought it look stupid but i downloaded and played it and now im addicted to it i recommend this game
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I loved this book. The Lost Daughter by Shilpi Somaya Gowda brings you into the lives of two families of diverse cultures - with love of family at the center of each.
B007SGM084|2.0|Time and time again I find myself ordering the paper books because of cost. Not only can I pass them on to others when they are done I can sell on ebay. What are they thinking. I seriously want the Kindle Fire, but hesitate for just this reaso[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]n.
0345803485|5.0|I found out about the book watching tv. So I ordered it and I am glad I did. I found it very interesting and couldn't put it down. I read it in 2 days. I love the female lead and have compassion for the hero and I do think he is a hero. And yes the sex is great and different! Wow the world of doms and subs frightening and seductive at the same time. Can't wait to read book two!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this game and it's finally hear! This game is awesome but sometimes it gets a little boring... but this game is free so it is free, so get it!
0345803493|5.0|I loved it! I found the story line very interesting between an inexperienced girl and though sexually mature emotionally inexperienced man. I like how their relationship is unfolding and of course the sex is great.
B0086700CM|5.0|this application is outstanding! I downloaded this app two days ago andnim already addicted! I would recomend this app for every one! you need to have this appbon either your phone or tablet!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Superb book! I enjoyed this from start to finish. Ms Collins has a great writing style and her way of describing the conditions of the characters, their surroundings, their feelings is exceptional. I thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy and look forward to others from this author. My only regret is that I waited so long to read them!
B0086700CM|4.0|its a awesome game but on the kindle fire the controls r a little hard but still is a great game
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoy this app.  It has vibrant colors for pleasing play and just enough automation where needed.  Good job.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|I think we all know that this DAC is amazing.<br /><br />Brilliant sound that rivals 200$+ products, proven to have distortions that are inaudible to the human ear, bass boost that doesn't muddy the sound(on 1 at least).<br /><br />Lets get to the downsides. I bought this as not only a DAC, but an amplifier for my Android phone(no LOD currently available for it) - it didn't make it much louder(only 4db according to other objective measurements). Furthermore, if you charged the E7 while using the AUX input, you get a ton of noise, especially when the source is quiet.<br /><br />EDIT: I forgot to note that while it doesn't make it louder, the detail doesn't fall off as badly at lower volumes compared to unamped.
0345803507|5.0|Recommended to many and lead to some deep questions at the end!  Made want to pick up the second book to see what more would happen.
0486266885|5.0|Although sometimes overlooked, Robert Louis Stevenson's novella of dual identity ranks with Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" and Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" as one of the great horrific works of the 19th century. I first read it as a boy and I recently returned to it for the upteenth time -- and I'm in my early 50s now. This is one of those stories to which an appreciative reader can relish, over and over again.<br /><br />That said, I must warn anyone expecting a really good fright that our modern sensibilities probably prevent this book from having that effect. And in fact, \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" was never as terrifying as \\"Frankenstein,\\" the story of a man who presumes godly powers but creates a monster, or \\"Dracula,\\" the tale of a creature who seems to have cheated death. Instead, this story of Dr. Henry Jekyll's transformation into a malformed thug is creepy, yes, but also quite sad.<br /><br />But that evocation of pathos may be the book's greatest strength. As a reader, I am repelled by Mr. Hyde but also feel a great pity for him, so twisted he is in body, mind and soul. Stevenson, able to create those conflicting emotions in his audience, stands as one of our great writers.<br /><br />I have read that some people reading this book for the first time have been disappointed by the experience, partly because of their own lofty expectations. If you're coming to the book anew, remember that it was written in a different time, long before we had become jaded by slasher films and pointless exercises in cruelty such as the \\"Saw\\" and \\"Hostel\\" series. This is a marvelous (and short!) tale of a man who lets his humanity slip away into the darkness. Highly recommended.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|We got this Lego set for my son's 10th birthday.  He has so much lego it is hard for us to justify another set, but this one looked really cool.  The box indicates 14+, but my 10 year old built it within 2 days.  The normal lego set for ages 6-12 he puts together in less than 30 minutes, so this gave a little more value for the money.  The number of pieces made it a little harder to build.  However, the biggest reason it was harder to build is that the pieces were not separated into bag 1, 2 and 3, but were all together.  The instructions are very clear and easy to follow, so inch by inch it is a cinch.  It has a lot of details within the design, and it looks very pretty.  It even is durable for playing with.  The boosters and fuel tank detach for pretend take off.  For the landing you have to put down the landing gear.  I would definitely recommend this product as a collectors item and as a toy.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing. I really like it and it makes time go by quick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAH YAH WOOHOO WOO HOO
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome the content and rewards make it possible to play with little interruption . this game is so fun and it keeps you interested
B0042RJWTC|2.0|I don't understand:  if they were going to get so far off \\"history,\\" by stressing the lurid aspects of this story, if they were going to fudge so much . . . why didn't they just bring in some fantasy writers to change the names up to be a bunch of fictional kings and battles, kind of like \\"Game of Thrones\\"?<br /><br />How much work would that have been?
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the bomb. everyone should git it its full screen and so fun. my only comlant is that it freezes up every now and then. well enjoy :)
B000FC11A6|5.0|What can I say about this book? It was very fun to read and almost impossible to put down. Equal parts WW2 action and modern day techno-corporate thriller, with a healthy dose of cryptography and treasure hunting. Read this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a great app my kids lived it!!!!! many people love  stuff like this and you should too!!!!! my family cherishes this game!!!!

0688156819|1.0|Wow.  I've never returned a book before, but I did this one.  I'm a huge Tim Burton fan, absolutely love his movies and sketches.  But the man is a terrible poet.  The subject matter is trite, the meter and rhythm would embarrass a fourth-grader, and I was left feeling perplexed and startled by the huge difference between the quality of his verse and his films.  The images were clever and creepy.  It's the words that made this such a dreadful chore to plow through.  I winced on every page.  NOT recommended, even to fans.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like and so do the kids. easy to earn points and great way to kill time. cant stop playing.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|We were very disappointed with this headset as it broke within a couple of weeks.  We have contacted the manufacturer several times with no return calls or emails.  Too much money for something that didn't last!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I borrowed this for free so i figured i could see what all the fuss was about without risking anything, and i honestly thought it would be another one of those oversold and overrated flavor of the month kind of things, nothing i would get into.<br />WRONG!! I found myself lost in a world that can only be described as blunt, hard but not begging for simpathy.The charictors are so deep and, unlike most books, i couldent even compare them to anyone im my life. it was hard to put this book down and when i did all i could think about was what would happen next, how long i would last if it was me in there. i highly recommend this, even if you dont usually agree with the trends. This book will make an impact on you.
B0086700CM|1.0|its really boring i honestly cannot figure out why everyone likes it u run forever. not challenging at all it is not worth my time . someone give me insight onto why you like it?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I will admit that the writing of the book was a little off (choice of words) but, the idea behind the book was great. Christan and Ana are just trying to see if she (Ana) can fit into Christan's idea of a relationship. Ana not having any idea of what a relationship should be like, but she knows that this is not the way. Christan not ever having anyone to question the who, what, when, wheres, and hows of the way he conducts relationships make him rethink his lifestyle and his idea of what a real relationship should be.<br /><br />I thought it was a great book, because behind the bad writing there is a wonderful story about two people falling in love and all the issues that come with that.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is the best game ever!!! you have to get it. I bet you would really like it too. the first time I tried it I really liked it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is just to fun u will get addicted to it if u want time to go by fast just play this an the will just fly right by
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|I'm surprised this movie wasn't given higher ratings across the board.  I had no idea what to expect when I watched it but am a fan of Liam Neeson and thought it had something to offer my husband (action movie lover) and my son (movie content, production critic) ... something the 3 of us could watch and enjoy.<br />Well, it was amazing!  Extremely intense and emotional. All three of us sat for seconds after the ending just staring at the credits and then jumped into animated conversation about how it affected each of us.<br />The movie wasn't about the CG wolves, it was about the men who went through the experience and how each handled the slim chance of surviving their situation.  It was CHARACTER driven and Liam Neeson is at his best.<br />I would have given 5 stars but the movie does drag a bit.  It could have been about 15 minutes shorter all told without harming it's impact.  If you are looking to \\"feel good\\" don't watch it but if you want a movie that will punch you in the stomach and trigger real emotional response....this is a winner!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I cant understand what all the fuss is with 50 Shades of Grey. The writing was terrible and quite frankly, after a while the only redeeming quality about the series, the steamy sex, became redundant and really unrealistic. I found myself skipping over it by book 2 because it was just ridiculous. I read somewhere this story was based on a fansite for twilight and it makes sense. It is the same story! Same characters! Same plot! It is so obvious! And it is just as ridiculous. Shy, self conscience girl meets dark brooding (filthy rich) stranger and they fall madly in love in a matter of weeks. The kind of ridiculous love seen only in Nicholas Sparks stories. He is insanely jealous and possesive, which borderlines on abusive and would make any sane girl run for the hills! She somehow sticks around because he has some redeeiming qualities and says or does something sweet. Then she gets in danger and he comes to the rescue and they live happily ever after getting everything they want without having to sacrafice anything or anyone or themselves. Its perfect. And unreal.<br />  No one speaks like they do. If I had to read someone begging the other never to leave them, how their world would collapse and cease to exist without the other, I might have gorged my own eyes out. It was sappy and over the top. Especially in between the rough and demeaning sex. And the sex...who really has mindblowing sex within minutes of mindblowing sex. Its all they did. And it got old. Fast. There was very little time for anything in between the fighting and the sex. But of course the danger and the rescuing and more pining for each other.<br />  I wish authors would write stories about strong female characters. Who are sure of themselves and dont need rescuing and dont spend countless hours wasting time wondering what a man would possibly see in her. I UNDERSTAND THIS IS FICTION and for entertainment, but I read this before, when I read Twilight. Sub out (no pun intended) the shiny 17 year oldvamp for the adult sadist and its the same tired story. I just dont understand what the big deal is about this series. It was a thinly veiled mystery that turned out to fizzle. It was no major twist that anyone can see coming and I probably should have save myself the time and money and stopped after the 1st one.

B004EPYZV2|3.0|Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a rollicking piece of eye candy directed with aplomb by live-action novice Brad Bird, yet it is not without its flaws. Many of the action sequences--including the amazingly inventive and enthralling centerpiece--a risky `secure the macguffin' scene in and around the world's tallest building--absolutely stun. The characters, notably the ever-cheeky Simon Pegg and relative newcomer Jeremy Renner, are highly likable (even Tom Cruise delivers an understated and magnetic performance, despite looking about half-a-year too old for the role). The film is slightly overlong and the plot paper-thin however, which shouldn't be a problem for the adolescent target audience. More or less the objective (should you choose to accept it) is to secure the case. What's in the case? Nuke codes! Why does the villain want them? World domination! Why? Who cares! Can we stop him? Well, we'll sure give it the ol' college try. Boom. Blam. Globe-trotting, fisticuffs, and dandy gadgetry-fueled action sequences ensue. The film is goofy (see the clumsily-animated CGI opening titles), charming (gotta love that theme song, even the tenth time!), and watchable, yet a little too ridiculous from time to time (why does Ethan feel the need to send that car crashing down at the end? Just for the sake of one more explosion?) and overlong by about fifteen minutes. Still, if you are looking for mindless popcorn entertainment, you could do a lot worse. Yes, Michael Bay, I'm looking at you. You could learn a lot from Mr. Bird, who, given a little less puffy of a script, could create great things. And perhaps, next year, he will.

0066620996|4.0|As a small business owner this is a great book to read. This book gave me a great insight as to what is need to become successful and also what is need in order to become an overall great company. Jim Collins goes in to a good detail description of what make a great leader. For me this gave me a good sense of what kind of a leader I need to be with the people that work for me. Even thought this book state a lot of very basic concepts they serve as a very good reminder and makes to that the read gets the point by repetition of what is need to become a great company. Overall, I would recommend it even if your not a business owner. It will open up a whole new way of thinking and will open up the curiosity to find out how to go from Good to Great.

B005EGXTHG|4.0|Catching fire is not as fresh and engagine as the first book the series \\"Hunger Games\\". It explored more of the historical background and friendship rather than focusing on the game itself. I read this book just after finishing the first one, so it provided a good background to continue on the third book. I would recommend every book lover to read this one!!!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Excellent series and story - Blu-Ray video quality is excellent get it over the DVD. Can't wait for Season two to come out on Blu-Ray.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|maybe its because im still a teenager that i felt so touched by this book. i understand hannah's need to be accepted in the book. the emotional distress she went through may not seem like a big deal for some of the people reading this book. but i believe hannah suffered from depression, which was untreated and undiagnosed. depression is very close to me so maybe thats why this book touched me so deeply. it got me through a rough time in my life this year actually, because this book helped me realize that its not worth it. and some people may not see that the main point of this book is not just a teenage girl overreacting and committing suicide. the main point of this book is watch what you do, and say, and dont be so damn judgemental because you never know what goes on behind the doors to a person's mind. you dont know people's situations, so dont assume you do, and that everything you do to people sticks, and builds up until they just cant take it anymore. Hannah's snowball got too big and it broke her. so next time you say something to somebody, think of how you say it, and what you say, and reflct on what you may have done in the past, and build back those bridges you may have broken.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|There's a Disney version, a comedy version, and then a dark version?! That's the best idea EVER! \\"Snow White & the Huntsman\\" was a fantastic hit! What's cool is that the Huntsman steals the spotlight of the Snow White legend. Now anyone under 7 will cry their trousers out for violence and frightening images... fair heads up. Anyway, on to the film: The beginning REALLY grabbed me, the middle could've improved, and the end was average. In my ending vision, Snow White could've died, the Huntsman could've done that incredible dialogue, and when she wakes up; THE END. Still, it was good. So give it a shot; you'll like it!

B004EPYZPS|5.0|It's one of the best summer film in years! It's slick, cool, and a little scary. The only backfire of \\"Super 8\\" is the language. It should've been rated R for pervasive language, but what's worse is that the KIDS say it. It's just not right; it's like playing with Playdo! Be cautious parents, but over that, Abrams and Spielberg make a great team making a film that makes everyone connected to the film.
B007C3TVNA|5.0|In an interview with Lionel Shriver' about her highly successful 2005 novel she commented on the difficulty of the project: `It was admittedly draining. And throughout, I was anxious that because I had never had a child myself, I didn't know what I was talking about and readers who were parents would catch me out.' As adapted for the screen by director Lynne Ramsay and Rory Kinnear this story becomes a terrifyingly realistic exploration of the subject of inherent evil and the manner in which we deal with it. The film is particularly timely as we read almost daily of youngsters killing classmates in schools across the country. But first the story:<br /><br />Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton) is trying to piece together her life following the \\"incident\\". Once a successful travel writer, she is forced to take whatever job comes her way, which of late is as a clerk in a travel agency. She lives a solitary life as people who know about her situation openly shun her, even to the point of violent actions toward her. She, in turn, fosters that solitary life because of the incident, the aftermath of which has turned her into a meek and scared woman. That incident involved her son Kevin Khatchadourian (Ezra Miller as a teenager and Jasper Newell as a 6 year old and Rock Duer as a toddler), who is now approaching his eighteenth birthday. Eva and Kevin have always had a troubled relationship, even when he was an infant. Whatever troubles he saw, Franklin (John C. Reilly), Eva's complacent husband, just attributed it to Kevin being a typical boy. The incident may be seen by both Kevin and Eva as his ultimate act in defiance against his mother.<br /><br />Ramsay tells her story in bits and pieces of a collage of moments from the birth of Kevin to his incarceration. For some this kind of non-linear story telling may be disconcerting, but for this viewer it seems like a close examination of the mind of a mother who simply cannot believe she has birthed and is raising a child who is the epitome of evil. The fact that we are aware of something hideous that has happened from the beginning does not get in the way of watching the slow maturation of Kevin - first as a constantly screaming infant to a maliciously bad little boy to a viciously cruel and evil teenager with whom his mother cannot connect except for one very telling instance when she reads the young Kevin `Robin Hood' and his arrows, at which point Kevin shows a degree of affection for Eva. That moment proves in retrospect to be the nidus for the horror that lies ahead. Yet to say more about the story wound diminish the impact one the viewer. Tilda Swinton is extraordinary in her role as is Ezra Miller. The film. At least, for this viewer, is a powerfully disturbing one and a very fine insight into how evil deeds can happen.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I must admit, ever since buzz about an \\"Alien prequel\\" started floating around the internet about two years ago, I've been in a state of intense anticipation. When I discovered that the project had moved in another direction and became Prometheus, I, like many other fans, began following the near endless stream of trailers, images, and viral videos that have been churned out for the film the last few months, all the while eagerly latching onto each new show of the \\"space jockey\\" or allusion to Alien.<br /><br />Then I saw the film. I must admit that my disappointment was partially my own fault for letting myself get carried away by the hype, but the studio ought to have some regret for stoking such anticipation for what they must have known is film that is little more than average. Or perhaps that's why they did it. Either way, the film gets off to a rather nice start, and the first hour is, particularly for Alien fans, quite enjoyable. Seeing the crew explore a derelict ship like the one in Alien, finding its crew of \\"space jockeys\\" and the persistent about-to-become-an-Alien-movie allusion to the original film are enough to have me, and most of the audience, on the edge of their seats. Then the film reaches the hour mark, and it's all down hill from there. The script runs out of steam, resorting to twists such as Guy Pearce's appearance on the ship and the yawn-inducing \\"twist\\" that Charlize Theron's character is his daughter. Characters such as David, that had been set up in the first half as scheming and multi-faceted, suddenly become flat, and characters seem to forget what had happened earlier in the film (where's the tension between Noomi Rapace and Theron after she kills Holloway? What about David's role in infecting him with the virus? IT'S ALL FORGOTTEN). Worse still, the trailers had literally spoiled all of the scenes we get with the various alien creatures, from the hammerpede to the tentacle monster. What we saw in the trailers is all there is, and much of the ending, with the space jockey ship being hit by the Prometheus, is also ruined in the ads. The ending, while interesting, is shameless for the extent to which is drops any attempt to answer the questions posed in the film, instead setting up for the inevitable Prometheus 2. The last shot, while interesting, is also an entirely predictable shout out to Alien fans that I, and judging from their reaction the whole audience, thought was poorly done. The movie also consistently breaks its own logic, and the constant to-and-fro from the Prometheus to the derelict feels both unnecessary and pointlessly frenetic. While the set designs and the planet Scott creates are impressive, I never felt very drawn into the film's atmosphere after the story leaves the derelict for the first time. The music is entirely bland, and I frequently didn't even notice that it was there.<br /><br />As for the characters, I was shocked by how one dimensional and static they were, especially given the all-star cast. While Fassbender is predictably good as David, the character itself is hindered by a script that forgets halfway through what makes the character interesting. While Rapace does a decent job as Shaw, some of her dialog delivery was so poor I actually cringed. Would it have killed them to do a second take on some of these scenes? The rest of the cast is entirely unmemorable, save for Idris Elba-who is himself underutilized-, particularly Logan Marshal-Green, who is killed off so early and in such an uninspiring fashion that I found myself wondering why they even bothered having the character in the first place.<br /><br />Overall, setting aside my own self-inflicted hype disappointment, Prometheus is an undeniably mediocre film that will tickle the fancy of Alien fans in some respects, but will satisfy no one's expectations. Still, I recommend the film to Alien fans for the hint of magic that the film has. I just wish they had aspired to more than the middle ground of unoffensive mediocrity.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Upon seeing the film a second time, I can honestly say that it's good. Once you have any expectations that it will be an Alien film removed by the first viewing (which I found jarring, hence my poor initial reaction) you can really enjoy it as its own film. Recommended.e mediocrity.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />Upon seeing the film a second time, I can honestly say that it's good.

B0024FAG5I|5.0|Since I've seen this movie on tv and have the regular dvd, and love it, I bought the blu ray. The sound is better, and there is more detail, especially in the dark areas than in the regular dvd. No extras, bummer. I do recommend the blu ray.<br /><br />I love this movie. I can't help but watch this homage to spaghetti westerns if it's on tv. It's simple and easy to follow, the cinematography is A+ for the genre, the acting...is probably a little cheesy, but the story calls for it.<br /><br />Even tho' in the real Wild West, duels were few and far between, this is what Joe and Joan Average think of the West. It's all gritty close-ups, villians and characters with questionable pasts, the innocent young folks, the jaded coffin maker and Doc, the evil town mayor, the barkeep, and the Hero. Who happens to be a woman, in this one. This is my favorite Sharon Stone flick, leather, squinting, guns and unkempt hair suit her. She is the female \\"Man with no Name\\", The Lady.<br /><br />If you have never seen this movie and you are a spaghetti western fan, see it. You just might love it.

English is assigned Tucker as his assistant. English doesn't appreciate him at first, but the youngster (\\"Sir, I'm not 21 until September,...\\") proves his worth. My favorite is the spoof of Lotte Lenya's character from the James Bond film. While English and Tucker are out to thwart a plot against the Chinese premier, a plucky little Chinese lady is getting in their way. She is deadly with a vacuum cleaner and an assortment of other tools as well. It's a fun flick and worth looking at.

B0081JDMUW|5.0|*** Second review 9/7/2014 ***<br /><br />Driving Towards the Daylight was the first Joe Bonamassa album that I listened to, and my original review is below.  However, in the two years since then, I have become a student of Joe Bonamassa's catalog.  With that in mind, I offer a second take in light of his complete body of work (prior to the release of Different Shades of Blue).  Prior to this album, Bonamassa's music peaked with the pair of albums Sloe Gin and The Ballad of John Henry.  While Black Rock and Dust Bowl were still very good albums, they were not of epic proportions of their predecessors.  My short take is that Driving Towards the Daylight is somewhere in between.  It doesn't belong in the same conversation with Sloe Gin and The Ballad of John Henry, but it is better overall that the experimental Black Rock and overly collaborative Dust Bowl.<br /><br />Bonamassa has three original tracks on this album (\\"Dislocated Boy\\", \\"Driving Towards The Daylight\\", and \\"Heavenly Soul\\").  Each of these is a different in the style that it emphasizes, but they are all strong.  The rocker of the bunch is \\"Dislocated Boy\\" while \\"Driving Towards The Daylight\\" and \\"Heavenly Soul\\" each have rich vocal harmonies to go along with more of a blues sound.  Both of these feature the return of Doug Henthorn (who supplied lead vocals on \\"Tea For One\\" on You and Me), but he only supplies harmony here.  In my book, this works much better than the collaborations on Dust Bowl (notably John Hiatt and Vince Gill).  The extra depth Henthorn provides makes both of these tracks standout.<br /><br />Among the cover songs, I liked \\"Who's Been Talking\\", \\"A Place In My Heart\\", and \\"New Coat Of Paint\\" the most.  The former has a clip from an interview with Howlin' Wolf as an intro while the other two are this album's offerings in the soulful ballad category.  However, these are still not quite the same style as \\"So Many Roads\\" or \\"Midnight Blues\\".  New band member Arlan Shierbaum (keys) shows that he is a great addition on \\"New Coat Of Paint\\" with his masterful organ work.  Other key musicians make their first appearances with Bonamassa in Michael Rhodes (bass) and Blondie Chapman (rhythm guitar).  All of the newcomers will play roles in future live performances.<br /><br />You may be wondering, \\"Why isn't Driving Towards the Daylight at the apex of Bonamassa's catalog along with Sloe Gin and The Ballad of John Henry?\\"  It is a strong album through the first nine tracks, but then it fizzles.  I can't put my finger on why exactly, but \\"Too Much Ain't Enough Love\\" and \\"Somewhere Trouble Don't Go\\" come up short.  On the album closer, part of it is Jimmy Barnes' vocals.  I think this would have been better if Bonamassa had handled the vocal duty.  With \\"Somewhere Trouble Don't Go\\", perhaps it is just not that good of a song.  In the end, these bring the album down a notch.  Don't get me wrong.  It is still a very good offering, and it is a must have for Bonamassa fans.<br /><br />Overall:  A-<br /><br />*** Original Review ***<br /><br />I am late to the party on Joe Bonamassa, but I decided to give his latest album a try.  I've been very pleased with Driving Towards the Daylight.  I find his style to be similar to Kenny Wayne Shepherd.  Most of the songs are rowdy blues rockers, but there are also a few ballads including the title track.  Bonamassa has a vocal delivery suited to the music he plays.  He is able to lend emotion to the ballads \\"Driving Towards The Daylight\\" and \\"A Place In My Heart\\" while having enough grit on the up-tempo songs (\\"Dislocated Boy\\", \\"New Coat Of Paint\\").  However the main reason to check out Joe Bonamassa is to hear his guitar work.  His style is for those who like the aforementioned Shepherd or Stevie Ray Vaughn.  While he demonstrates a good feel for the blues, he also shows off some good technique as he does on \\"Lonely Town Lonely Street\\" with the back and forth solo at the end where he trades off with the Hammond B3.  He alsoreminds me of Jeff Healey on \\"A Place In My Heart\\".<br /><br />Just because this is a blues album doesn't mean that it is all downers.  \\"Heavenly Soul\\" is as catchy of a song as you will find on a blues album, and \\"Who's Been Talking\\" has a spoken intro describing the Calypso rhythm employed on the song.<br /><br />Overall I am quite pleased with Driving Towards the Daylight, and I plan to check out his other work.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes blues rock.<br /><br />Download this:  Heavenly Soulust because this is a blues album doesn't mean that it is all downers.  \\"Heavenly Soul\\" is as catchy of a song as you will find on a blues album, and \\"Who's Been Talking\\" has a spoken intro describing the Calypso rhythm employed on the song.

B0026YWQ4Q|4.0|Like I said above. Want to see the rest. I think pretty much everyone has seen this movie, so instead of repeating what others have said, probably at least twice I'll just leave this as is. The main reason I even write reviews is to rate using the stars. We should have the option to rate with the stars alone, and/or write a review. I don't know many people that have the time to actually write a review for every product they own. Furthermore, I just feel as though it's helpful to see what others have rated a specific product. Perhaps saving time, money, and effort, or the reverse.
B0083VDK96|5.0|I discovered Melody Gardot on her debut CD Worrisome Heart through Amazon's recommendations, and I have all three of her major releases.  The Absence is the latest step in her musical evolution following her breakout album My One and Only Thrill.  So far she is not one to make the same album twice.<br /><br />The Absence finds her spanning the globe musically after having done so on her travels.  The result is a musical potpourri with heavy doses of island and Latin American sounds.  She also mixes in Portuguese (\\"Lisboa\\" and \\"Me Voce Se Ama\\") where she ventured into French on her previous work.  However I believe she does work in some French on \\"Impossible Love\\" here.<br /><br />The instrumentation has even more variety than the language/lyrics.  The opener \\"Mira\\" has island guitar and lilting violins that brings to mind (of all things) the Ewok celebration at the end of Return of the Jedi.  Both \\"So Long\\" and \\"So We Meet Again My Heartache\\" have the orchestral background the Gardot began using on the last album, but this time it has acoustic guitar layered on top of it.  \\"Impossible Love\\" has a Spanish feel to it with an interesting rhythm.  However Gardot reminds us that it is really her on \\"Goodbye\\" by providing a call back to \\"Your Heart Is As Black As Night\\" with its slow and smoky, speakeasy sound.  It is similar without being a trite rehash.<br /><br />In the end, though, it is Gardot's voice that anchors The Absence.  It is the one constant across all of her albums with its dusky, enchanting, melodic tones.  While she makes even less use of scat than she did on her previous album, she lets loose a few growls \\"Goodbye\\".  Melody Gardot is an amazing artist, and The Absence is the latest treat that she has given her fans.  I highly recommend it to old and new fans alike.<br /><br />Download this:  So We Meet Again My Heartache
B0083GPDBO|3.0|This movie, although interesting, was full of action, teenage hijinx and wrought with out of control teenage hormones.<br />It's bad enough that a bunch of spoiled teenagers should be finger-twiddling their I-phones, but having powers to fly and move great objects?<br />The movie ended as expected, and not as expected.  The expected part was that the teenagers ended, but the unexpected ending was that good prevailed.  I seriously doubt that any good would prevail if teenagers were given that much power.<br />The concepts behind the movie were interesting, and the special effects were good.<br />This is a good movie to sit down to, shut your brain off and stuff you face with popcorn and a flat soda to wash it down with.<br />Just hold back your urge to slap the first teenager you see after viewing.
B007BVOF8E|2.0|I watched this movie knowing that the movie was based on a book by a well known author.  I thought this should be interesting.<br />It didn't take long to realize that the movie was much like the book - dragging on and on, and on and on.  The grass grew three inches in the yard between the time I started watching and the time the credits started rolling.<br />So, after getting a good nap, I got up for some action of my own - I mowed the lawn.<br />Yawn!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved every page of it. couldnt put it down and my sister and nieghbor are now reading it. I even got my boss a copy and she is starting to read it. This summer must read!
B0073PZIBQ|4.0|I don't ever remember seeing this movie advertised, but I'm glad that I stumbled onto it while browsing Amazon's movie selections.<br />Steve Martin, Owen Wilson and Jack Black pulled this one off.<br />I came across this while browsing movies, read the description and would have probably gone right past it after reading that it's about bird watchers. Don't get me wrong - I love birds, but bird watchers?  Anyway, I noticed that it had a pretty good cast of actors that I like. So, I decided to watch the trailer - thus the hook.<br />I like comedies, and I like to watch them with my girlfriend.  I convinced her to watch the trailer. She being a big animal lover, she was easy to convince.<br />We both loved it.<br />It's about three lives, three bird watchers, and the special people in their lives. It was funny, and it was thought provoking.<br />If you got family, this is a good movie to share popcorn and laughs.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Love this game so does my 13 yo.  Darn watermelons!  Ill get you yet.  Puzzles and levels awesome.  Love the different types of games in the game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to come to the kindle fire for a long time. now that it is finally here I play it all the time. great. just plain fun.
B007ZESPME|5.0|This CD is fantastic... The Deluxe Edition, that is.  But DO NOT BUY IT HERE.  Target is selling the 18 track Deluxe Edition for HALF THE PRICE that Amazon is.  It's only $14.99, and it is EXACTLY the same disc.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a bunch of other songs from Season 1 available, but you can only download them from iTunes.  The best tracks are on this deluxe CD, and most of the iTunes exclusives are more songs from \\"Bombshell,\\" which, personally, I wasn't as interested in.  At least you can get them, though!!!
B007SGM084|3.0|I would like to buy these books, but correct me if I'm wrong...each book individually for kindle is $9.99..while the box set is $29.99 ...to purchase each book individually would cost a total of $29.97. How on earth does this pricing make sense? That its a save of three cents to buy the books separately? I've heard good reviews about the book's content, I am however not pleased with its pricing.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love this app .Its helps me with algebra .Use this app for anything.Pretty please make this app the better app.Rate it 5.

B0086700CM|5.0|OK, so I was bored one day and I remember my friend saying Temple Run was awesome so I tried it. It's super fun and I really recommend it. On the Kindle Fire, it glitches a bit but otherwise pretty fun!!!!
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This is my favorite Batman movie. I'm a casual fan who doesn't know much about the details of the background from the comics, and I have not seen some of the older ones, so take that for what it's worth. But as a great story with great characters that looks great in blu-ray, it is hard to top Batman Begins. Most people I know preferred The Dark Knight when we saw it, but I stick by Begins as better of the two. With the new movie coming out, I encourage picking this up for your own collection or to show a friend who hasn't yet seen it.
B0086700CM|5.0|enjoyable with just enough power ups to me the replay value high enough to keep you coming back for more
0670022705|4.0|You can read other reviews for details on the book. The short of it is that it's pretty fascinating.<br /><br />I just wanted to add that this is so great that my brother and I independently got it as gifts for family members. Fortunately, we thought of different family members and so it all worked out!
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|The DVD skipped in the middle of the movie and cut out.  That's bad.<br /><br />However, when I contacted the seller about the issue, they gave me a full refund and didn't even require me to return the damaged DVD.<br /><br />I'm upset that the DVD was damaged, but the great service makes me want to buy from wholesaledvdsforless again.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|The Bourne movies are one of the great trilogies brought to Blu-ray, fun movies that look great in HD. All three are fantastic movies, so if you don't own them on another format, I highly recommend this. One note, there's not really anything special about the boxed set per se. If you already own a couple of the movies, I'd suggest just buying the other movie individually. But if you don't own any of them, you can stop reading reviews. You know at some point you'll be buying this!
B007IE4DTU|5.0|Nothing beats having everything in one place-the excellent movie by Scorsese, the unrealeased music, the photos. Just great. Oh, and to be able to display it on the \\"coffee table\\" or what have you with a matted and framed photo of George is a nice touch.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a great game that has plenty power ups and upgrades to unlock. this game is hard to stop playing. its very addictive right from the start.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|I've been a fan of Mad Men since the first season, and this fifth season does not disappoint.  The writers did a good job in revisiting each main character after the one year hiatus; essentially, each main character has one episode in which they are the main focus, and the drama is built upon in subsequent episodes.  I do not watch a lot of TV, and I can definitely appreciate the complexity that was built into this season.
B00785P2QC|4.0|my son and I really enjoy playing g this game. however it ask me to have a lot of money and energy. if you want to play this game well you need to pay some money to build factories. that's why I gave just four stars for this game.
B0086700CM|5.0|I initially had my doubts to download, But the overwhelmingly high rating made me reconsider...how addictive! Now I  can't stop playing! great graphics, never gets boring.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|The game is full of intreage and excitement. Excellent story line. Lots of clues and hidden objects to be found and applied. Really keeps your mind going. one of the best mystery games.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|pretty good game, easy to learn. forces you to interact with other players before you can continue to progress, which is a drawback to me.
B000GBEWHA|4.0|When the idea for making a motion picture version of \\"Grease\\" was approved by the moguls at Paramount back in 1977 the studio gave producers Robert Stigwood and Allan Carr a budget of $6,000,000 to complete the project.  The conventional wisdom in Hollywood was that the film would generate lots of enthusiasm initially, make a neat profit and gradually fade away as the vast majority of films do.  No one could have ever predicted the magnitude of the hit they would have on their hands.  \\"Grease\\"  opened in over 800 theaters on March 27, 1978.  The critics were not that impressed but audiences loved it.  They still do. Not only would \\"Grease\\" become the top grossing motion picture of 1978 but when all was said and done \\"Grease\\" would become the highest grossing movie musical of all-time with a worldwide gross of some $387,000,000!<br /><br />I think the main reason that \\"Grease\\" has remained so popular over the decades is that it truly is a fun movie.  There are so many films out there featuring blood and guts that a film like \\"Grease\\" is a welcome oasis for many of us.  This is a film that features a fabulous musical score, innovative choreography and a remarkable chemistry among the members of a highly talented cast.  Everyone seemed to love the performances by the film's two stars John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.  Travolta loved the stage play and lobbied hard to play the part of Danny Zuko in the film.  Meanwhile, Olivia Newton-John was intrigued when offered the role of Sandy by the producers but insisted on a screen test to make sure she was right for the role.  As it turned out she was just perfect.  The chemistry between these two and their enthusiasm for this project is quite apparent from the very first scene in the film.  Meanwhile,  Jeff Conaway, who played Danny Zuko in the Broadway production of \\"Grease\\"  adds his considerable talent to the mix in the role of Danny's best buddy Kenickie.  And let us not forget the noteworthy contributions of  Stockyard Channing and Didi Conn in the roles of Rizzo and Frenchy.  Finally, the producers added to the appeal of this film by including several 1950's icons in the cast including Sid Caesar, Edd Byrnes, Eve Arden, Joan Blondell and Fannie Flagg.  It was a nice touch.<br /><br />I think most folks would agree that what makes \\"Grease\\" so doggone appealing  is the sensational  music.  The film spawned four Top Five singles in 1978 including \\"Hopelessly Devoted To You\\", \\"Summer Lovin\\" and the #1 smash \\"You're The One That I Want\\".  At the same time the soundtrack LP was a monster hit as well.  Other notable tunes from the film include Stockyard Channing's surprisingly powerful \\"There Are Worse Things I Can Do\\",  John Travolta's \\"Sandy\\" and 50's teen idol Frankie Avalon (playing a teen angel) doing\\"Beauty School Dropout\\".  The film concludes with the entire cast  cut loose at an amusement park singing \\"We Go Together\\".  I enjoy these tunes just as much today as I did  then!  Furthermore,  I would be remiss if I failed to make mention of the incredibly innovative animated open to this flick that goes a long way in getting viewers in the proper frame of mind  to enjoy what follows.<br /><br />More than 30 years after it's release \\"Grease\\" continues to delight audiences of all ages.  It possesses a universal appeal that is rare in motion pictures these days.  In addition, it is that rare movie that the whole family can enjoy together.  I recently purchased the \\"Rockin' Rydell Edition\\"  that was released by Paramount in 2006.  This disc contains tons of extra features that really will enhance your enjoyment of this film.  This is a solid four star package. Highly recommended!rd Channing and Didi Conn in the roles of Rizzo and Frenchy.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|An engaging story; I know at least one friend who might be put off with the intertwined tales in different times, places, but the same people bouncing back and forth to be kept track of.<br /><br />If I had one complaint at the end, it is the lack of resolution (at least to me) of one such story line. A young man goes off in search of love, perhaps, a kiss he will follow anywhere, and realizes he has a greater purpose... and they do not appear on the same page together again, although they seem to both be there.<br /><br />These two characters make me want to read the continuing tales of this universe, even though the story was largely finished at the end of the book. But this one loose string is going to haunt me. Because the girl's character easily became my favorite topping the so-called main characters featured throughout the tale
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a fun and stressing but that's the fun part! And it keeps you going you'll NEVER want to stop.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am  very active and work out 6-12 times a week so I thought this work out would be pretty easy for me to do.  At first I thought I was going to die, she really does kick your booty in this workout.  Of course I was able to do all the workouts in this video with no problem after about a week or so.  It's great for everyone, just don't get frustrated or give up right away if it's too hard.  Give yourself some time and start with her first workout.  Don't move up until you can do all of workout one fairly easily.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Former Presidents can be excellent resources to the ones who succeed them, especially as they are the only ones who can truly understand and appreciate what the new President is going through.  This book explores the different ways former Presidents have been used, ignored or dismissed by succeeding Presidents from President Truman through President Obama.  In many cases political party lines have been erased or at least made less significant as the few members of this club rally to help each other.  At times even intense personal dislikes have been put aside for the good of our country, even though the bad feelings were still in evidence behind the scenes.  The book gives behind-the-scenes looks at the inner workings of the White House, and is fascinating reading for everyone regardless of their political party affiliation or views.  Those who are students of history will especially enjoy this.
B0086700CM|5.0|amazing app. they finally made this game for kindle fire's.  it was supposed to come out in January!  but it came in May. this app is fun and addicting. bye have fun with it!!!!
0765367297|4.0|I expected exaggerated biomech genre stuff, sliced and served cold. A book based on a first-person shooter video game, [[ASIN:B002BSA20M Halo Reach]]..really. But, I was pleasantly surprised by the flowing narrative style of the author, Eric Nylund. The story was so well crafted. It is hard to believe he didn't start writing until 1995. I imagine being married to Sci-fi writer, Syne Mitchell didn't hurt. What Nylund is good at is creating tension in the story and building suspense. The story takes place in the year 2552. The plot centers around the Spartans - carefully selected, relentlessly trained, and chemically enhanced men and women fighting to save humanity from alien invaders called the Covenant. Eventually, as the title suggest, they are unable to save the human colony living on Reach, home of the military center of the UNSC.  All in all, \\"Halo: The Fall of Reach\\" is a powerful and interesting story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It a great, sensual romantic book. I'm so invested in complexity of the characters and the book leaves you wanting more. A must read!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoyed the different games in this app. And even my 5 and 9 year old we joyed it. It has games for all ages.
B0086700CM|5.0|My daughter and I love to play this game. It is fast paced and challenging. It allows you to enjoy the game without paying extra money to move up levels.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|A Star Map is discovered by the Professionals, and as they explore it, they determine to possibly find a peaceful alien civilization that may hold the Golden Key to understanding the genesis of mankind. \\"PROMETHEUS\\" is not only science fiction at its best, but is a Must-see for all science fiction and thriller lovers. This chilling action-adventure is Outstanding, the acting is Superb, and this film brings to light questions and answers about the universe as it illuminates philosophy with skillful casting. The Images are Impressive, ending is good, and interesting and thought-provoking findings from the star map, found among remnants of ancient human civilization. All-in-all, Phenomenal, highly entertaining and Highly Recommended!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love this game! It's very logical, and if you like sudoku puzzles, you might find you like this game even more.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is enfuriatingly addicting, so much so that I find myself up at 2 AM playing still thinking it's early. So happy it's finally available for kindle!
B005ZUR724|5.0|An MMO that feels like it should. Quests and story line are nothing special, but they pass the time and help with progression.

B007AJFSJW|5.0|Professor Krugman is telling us again and again that this nation needs to resolve the real current employment crisis right now instead of fighting the fake \\"big government\\" and \\"unbearable debt burden for our children and grand-children\\" future problems by increase in income inequality. Please read this book and also please read Professor Krugman's column and blog in the New York Times.
0439023521|3.0|Many people, when they find out what Hunger Games is all about, have trouble deciding whether it is a good book to read or not. The topic is very violent, but it also teaches us about our own world.<br />The reason I criticize this book is because it is all about violence, bloodshed, and having to kill people for others to watch and enjoy. It is just not the kind of book you want to sit down and read.<br />However, this book is written very well, and can teach us many things about the way we look at violence. We are like the capitol, watching all sorts of horror movies.<br /> If you do read it, you have to look at it the right way and realize how horrible it is that we yearn for and enjoy watching violence.
B003IY47JK|5.0|I'm not good at long drawn-out reviews like other folks nor do I have anything against long drawn-out reviews, so with that said..... If you're a fan of Symphonic Metal you should definately check-out Delain's album \\"Lucidity\\" For being their first album it's a damn good start! The album does have a good amount of guest musicians and vocalists so you'll notice where (Charlotte Wessels, Lead Singer of Delain) doen't sing in some of the songs, \\"if it were up to me, Charlotte would've done 100% of the vocals on the album!!!\\" but that's just my opinion.
B001E45XT4|4.0|Sounds great for the money! Problem is, my mic crapped out after 4 months. It can get a little hot after extended use but its actually better than some other headphones that I have used. The earpads are made of soft fabric, so it is very comfortable.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I got this book because all of the reviews raved about how great it was.  The weren't wrong at all!  I couldn't put this book down once I started.  Awesome and entertaining story of the future of Mankind.  Trapped deep down underground in a silo.  A complete culture spawned from living in tight quarters together.  Well put together.  I was worried it was going to be really dark but it wasn't.  Can't recommend it enough or wait for the next installment.
0316056863|5.0|Contrary to another review, I believe her dry, punchy sense of humor DOES work in this format.  As you read it, you can picture how she speaks, thinks, the same as she writes.  I have 2 kids under 3 and it's nice to read something that makes you laugh, is an easy read and in many ways I can relate.  I swear, she and I have the same Dad.  If you want to read something light hearted, that will make you laugh out loud and is a quick read, this is the book for you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think  that  this game is a fun and educational .I will keep playing for a long time. It is great
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|so freaking cool I love it it needs to have more to it just needs a touch or 2 and I would love it more
B0052VUNHC|5.0|From the beginning, the book completely blew my mind away. I initially thought it was going to be a silly novel but found myself completely engrossed in the plot forgetting my reality and converting myself into abby. would love if this novel could continue onto a series.
B005I0DUMC|5.0|I previously owned the [[ASIN:B0001XALT6 Cop Land (Exclusive Director's Cut) (Miramax Collector's Edition)]] on DVD, which had a decent transfer for a standard definition DVD.  You can tell by the output, that a lot of effort went into restoring this movie to bring an authentic movie experience to your HD television.  The colors are crisp and vibrant, and the sound is loud and clear.  All of the special features from the Collector's Edition DVD are on this Blu-Ray disc as well.  Upgrading to the HD version for a movie like this was well worth it, especially for the action at the end of the third act.  Anyone who is a fan of this movie that has a Blu-Ray player should definitely upgrade to this edition.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Mr Howey - congratulations. What a fantastic story - I love the way you wrote this story, like peeling back the layers of an onion, with each revelation, the mystery deepened further.  That's a true accomplishment in this day of me-too writers simply rehashing the same old plot mechanics.  Fantastic.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is a great cover for the Kindle Fire. It is well made and keeps my Kindle protected at all times.

B0086700CM|4.0|okay so like temple run is really fun and addictive but ive had it on kindle fire for 2 months before it came out from this website and it was a free downlaod. it has tons of kindle fire apps that are free when in the market they can b 20 dollars. it s a cool website. anyways, that version was so much better than this crap. the game is fun but the web download wasn't laggy or glitchy and the graphics were better. when I downloaded this I thought it'd b even better. I was wrong! these graphics are far worse and it crashed ans erased by record of like 3 million and all my money ans characters ans powerups so I basically have to earn everything all ovr again. :(
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it isn't my favorite game but it is really fun but if you rate it rate it a 3 stars

1401233791|4.0|The '90's were not kind to comic books.  Aside from a few exceptions, that decade was characterized by mediocre storytelling, sensationalized, gimicky, over-the-top plots, and flashy art.  In Batman Knightfall, you get two of the three: the writing is okay but not great, and the plot leads up to Batman getting his spine broken by a new and more vicious supervillain.  The art is more serviceable than flashy -- mostly handled by the likes of Jim Aparo, Norm Breyfogle, and Graham Nolan, and it all flows very sequentially and creates an easy-to-follow story, but none of the panels really stands out in a way that would make you want to pause and take a second glance.  The storyline also has a lot of plot holes.  To name a few:<br />[SPOILER ALERT]<br />The villain Bane has a very superficial reason for wanting to take over Gotham and hurt Batman, and once Batman's rogues gallery is released from Arkham, they all immediately assemble criminal gangs and begin committing crimes, with no other motivation given except that they're all crazy and that's just what they do.  Bane always has a henchman who just happens to know the location where the next villain will strike, so that he's able to relay info on Batman back to villain HQ, and Bane figures out Batman's secret identity just by watching Bruce Wayne from afar and recognizing that he must be Batman.<br />[END SPOILERS]<br />If there's a strength to this volume, it's in the incredible length of the storyline, which stretches over a full 24 issues (one of which is a 63-page special), and that just sets up part 2 of the story in Knightquest.  A sustained plotline that stretches that long is pretty impressive, even if the motivations of the villains are pretty poorly defined.  This is fun, fun, fun to read, and it does cover a pretty pivotal and devastating event in the life of the Dark Knight.  Also, even though the interior art is nothing to marvel at, the cover art looks fantastic, and it is all reprinted here as well.  Most of the covers are done by Kelly Jones, and they all have an eerie, spooky, stylistic look to them.  You also get 2 characteristically weird-looking covers by Sam Kieth, an alternative wraparound cover to Batman 500 by Joe Quesada, and the Mike Deodato covers to the original 2 trade paperbacks that are included in this one single volume, and they all look great.<br /><br />The 3 storylines that I have always thought best exemplified the depths to which 1990's comics sunk to, were Spider-Man's Clone Saga, the Death of Superman, and Batman Knightfall.  But now that I've actually read through it, I have to admit that Knightfall is an enjoyable read, as long as you know what to expect.  There are no clever villain schemes or key insights into Batman's character, but you do get a fast-moving and epic-length (600+ pages!) account of one of the most traumatic events in the Batman's crimefighting career.  Recommended, because even if you know where the story is going (with Batman breaking his back, renouncing the mantle of the Bat, and eventually taking it back again), the journey there is a good one.

B006UG90RM|5.0|The Sammy Hagar years were not good in the end and Van Halen III was essentially forgettable. But \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" has the spark that made Women and Children First, Fair Warning, and Diver Down such classic albums (I can't put it into the same category as I, II, or 1984, those are just untouchable).  Eddie Van Halen is inspired and on a mission to play with not only his signature style, but with rhythms that have hooks that you can't help but want to hear over and over.  Sure there are some tracks that I could do without (Tattoo and You and your blues), but Blood and Fire, Big River, She's the Woman, and As Is easily make up for any mistakes.<br />This is the comeback of the decade.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|It was Great!!!  I enjoyed watching the movie with my husband for our \\"date night\\" at the Century Theater in California and then ordered the movie online through Amazon.com.

0060987464|5.0|I have read most of the book upon first receiving the book after purchasing it. I have to say, this is a side of Manson I never knew but had my suspicions of being how he came to be. And for anyone who had made poor reviews on his Born Villain Album about \\"younger generation listeners\\" and \\"emo listeners\\" being the ones to listen to the new work, it's not true. I'm 21 and when I was 4 he had his first album \\"Portrait of an American Family\\" released that same year. That was in 1994. My point? I'm not a \\"Younger generation listener\\" or an \\"Emo listener\\" and I enjoy his newer work including \\"Born Villain\\". Granted I was terrified of him as a kid, I had no choice but to listen to his music because my two older sisters loved him and listened to his music all the time. I didn't expect or want to expect this book to be \\"entertaining\\". I expected it to be exactly what it was; a descriptive form of art telling his deepest, darkest, and most inner secrets, fears, thoughts, and otherwise hauntings of his past growing up and his journey to becoming the greatest Goth Singer imaginable.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who is curious like I was to know the Brian Warner behind the Marilyn Manson and the reason WHY he's so controversial in more ways imaginable just to get a message across to the ignorance of the American Society of Human beings and their behaviors and interpretations of everything no matter what it may be. He truly is an extremely intelligent being. I would gladly shake his hand and tell him I feel the exact same way about almost everything he's tried to convey to the world. ***** &lt;-- Five starts for sheer genius in writing.

0061726834|5.0|I'm not sure why people are comparing this book so much to Hunger Games. Yes it's a dystopian series and there is a love story, but that is pretty much where the comparisons stop.  It would be like accusing Lord of the Rings of not being Harry Potter, obviously, it's a different book.  That being said, I loved Delirium. It took the idea of a dystopian world and tweaked it. Instead of people being physically controlled, they are emotionally and mentally controlled. By convincing people that love is a deadly disease and stripping them from it when they come of age, the government all but turns the population into a band of robots. But like in all good dystopian novels, there are those that resist the majority, and in a big way. I found Delirium wonderful, loved the characters, the premise, everything.  Give it a try, just don't expect it to be a Hunger Games copycat, just a very well written dystopian novel with a unique twist.

0345803485|1.0|I finally decided to find out what all the hype was about this book, so I downloaded the Kindle version from my local library. I'm so glad I didn't waste money purchasing it. This book is poorly written, with grammar errors through out. There is no character development, and the sex scenes are far less erotic than I expected.  I've read more erotic sex scenes in main stream romance novels.  Also, I couldn't find any reason to emotionally connect to the characters, much less like them -- which is a must for me to be able to truly enjoy a book.  Let's just say I returned the book without finishing it (according to my Kindle, I had about 15% of the book left), and will not bother reading the next two.

I hope this movie one day could be catogorized with some of the all-time greatest movies of all time, such as West Side Story.  Yes, I would go that far.  It is that good.  This is a movie that never has a dull moment.  Anyone that has ever admired art will especially appreciate this one.  Those who never appreciated art before will now after watching this movie.  Hey, just do yourself a favor and experience this one for yourself and see why almost no one gives it less than 5 stars!  What are you waiting for?

B004TN7QPG|5.0|This is THE reason that my Samsung Tab 2 7\\" gets used throughout the day/night ... it turns your tab into a reader that does EVERYTHING a Kindle or Nook can do, only with more control, \\"customizability,\\" and readability.<br /><br />The challenge for users will likely be that it is SO customizable, you may find yourself a bit overwhelmed by the range of options. Don't despair, it's worth learning and mastering all of them over time because you will be able to create the kind of reading experience (visual, controls, page turning, fonts/colors, themes, bookcase and file management, etc.) that you prefer.<br /><br />Can't imagine how there could be a better reader app for Android.<br /><br />There is one VERY minor gripe ... at one point there was a \\"chapter scroll\\" bar in addition to the whole book scroll bar ... the developer removed it since not many users cared about it. It would have been better had it been left available as \\"an option\\" since I actually used it a lot. But that doesn't take away from the overall awesomeness of this app.

076790592X|5.0|Over the years, I have heard people utter the title of this book. As a light read, or for an assignment in school, I have heard many great reviews and decided to read it myself. The text is not difficult to comprehend, but the meaning and message is what makes this book a success. In short, Tuesdays with Morrie is about a young man, Mitch, and his journey of rediscovering himself and his purpose in life, with the guide of his old college professor, Morrie, who is diagnosed with a terminal illness that gradually weakens the individual; and in time, his body will no longer be able to function properly. Mitch visits Morrie every Tuesday, where they have discussions about various, insightful topics such as death, forgiveness, regrets and love. It is through these Tuesday meetings with Morrie that Mitch is able to see how far he has moved away from the person he was in college, and how he has come to chase after all the wrong things in life.<br /><br />This book was truly inspirational, and shed a new light into the teachings of Buddhist philosophy. Morrie, described as a \\"religious mutt\\", connected several Buddhist philosophies into his life and medical situation. Morrie references the Buddhist philosophy that every morning when he wakes up, he'll ask the bird on his shoulder whether or not this is the last day he will be alive. This shows his awareness and acceptance towards his weakening body. In addition, Morrie has adopted the Buddhist way of detaching oneself from the physical world, because nothing on Earth is permanent. Through his conscious approach to detachment, he embraces and experiences the painful long coughs, but feels a detachment as if there is an external self looking at the physical body experiencing such. Lastly, Morrie talks about reincarnation, and his desire to come back to the Earth as a gazelle. The choice of being reincarnated as a gazelle shows that Morrie wishes to be active and unrestricted through physical limitations once again, like whenhe was younger. Morrie believes that death is not the end, and that life and death is not linear but cyclical. Therefore, he is not burdened or entirely depressed with the realization that his illness will, in the future, overpower his physical body. Buddhist philosophy in the context of Morrie's approach to life with a terminal illness has helped me understand Buddhism more in depth, and has increased my appreciation for the philosophies that this religion teaches.<br /><br />I can relate to this story, as I have experienced a similar situation with my grandfather's terminal cancer two years ago. Watching my grandfather grow weaker and weaker every time I visited him was possibly the hardest thing I've had to go through. And though in the end my grandfather lost the battle against cancer, his legacy and death taught me more than I could have ever imagined. I would recommend every person to read this book, because whether or not you have experienced something similar, this book will surely have a deep and lasting impact to your perception of life.
030788743X|1.0|One of the worst-constructed and worst-told stories I have sat down to try and digest in a long time. We quit about a third of the way through the story. It was unbearable. My wife finished the Twilight Saga and even she couldn't finish this.<br /><br />I really had my hopes up - I am a huge fan of boundary-smashing sci-fi like Neuromancer and Snowcrash, and this really seemed like it had all the right ingredients, and the reviews are just through the roof on Amazon... unfortunately the characters were stale, cliched, and unlikable, while the plot \\"twists\\" were visible miles away, telegraphed with the clumsiness of a child thinking they're getting away with a not-so-clever lie. The \\"universe\\" where the story takes place is a thoroughly pedestrian MMO - slightly more ambitious, maybe, than Snowcrash's meta-whatever (an obvious inspiration for this book), but arriving 15 or 20 years too late. In a world with 3D TV and fully-realized massively multiplayer online games all around us, the book instills not a sense of wonder about an impossible future, but a sense of boredom over nearly-plagiarized and underinformed understandings of the future of MMOs and the minds of classic tech entrepreneurs...<br /><br />Even taken on its own terms, as a wacky/silly/superficial pop culture whatever, the book STILL disappoints with inaccurate references to videogame lore (like the amateurish phrase of \\"XPs\\" instead of the actually-used \\"XP\\") and overly obvious references that any self-respecting geek finds utterly commonplace.<br /><br />No matter how you slice it, this is an endlessly pandering fairy tale with a complete lack of imagination or generosity, an offensive waste of time for geeks and non-geeks alike. I love pop culture and pop fiction but this book is all surface matter, winks and nudges; not a bit of substance to be found.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|I stay in India , so I was fortunate that I could order this item and could get it when my daughter was visiting in USA. There are a  lot of reviews written already on amazon which are very helpful, so there is not much for me to add. I will simoly say this. FANTASTIC. I was waiting for so many days to get this. I am simply too happy.

B0086700CM|5.0|cool game that.never gets boring and I'm so happy.its on the kindle for me to play now its so afdictinh
B004ZQ74G8|4.0|I have resisted reading this book despite the reviews; quite frankly because<br />I heard it was about a little boy trapped in a room and I thought it would be disturbing.  I was ultimately lured into buying the book once Amazon offered the electronic version for around $5. Very early into the story, I realized that the boy was not distressed and went on to very much enjoy this read.  I believe the sign of a good book is when you reflect on it after you have read it.  Weeks later, I find myself still thinking about the characters and story.  I have since recommended this to my `book friends and family` and would recommend to any readers looking for a good read.
B0086700CM|5.0|so fun and addicting finally an apple game is on the kindle fire just love it everybody should have this game you will play it forever it is so awesome

B004SDEP38|4.0|When Android started, lack of PDF and Office file format compatibility was high on most early adopters' wish lists.  Now that Google Docs/Drive is a mature and ubiquitous platform for productivity and data storage, it's never a concern for me whether I can handle MS file formats on any of my devices.  Still, Datavis' dedication to Android from early 2009-on has helped prove that Android devices are as useful and capable as any other platform, not to mention more open as a platform and less divisive as an ecosystem to software and hardware producers alike.  This program is a win for the little guy!  :-)
0345803485|4.0|So I've read the reviews seen all the media surrounding this book. I was very hesitant to read this book but I decided to after much insistence from my friends. I actually liked it, the story around the sex scenes was actually pretty intense. It was a kind of like Twilight but it was it's own story. The sex scenes were pretty hot except the final spanking. That was way intense and made me really want to read books 2 and 3. I would re-read this book but no more than once or twice.

Now he is a lil wayne clone kid ink type swag rapper who isnt really that talented. Without his cousin being Trav from Gym Class Heroes, this guy wouldn't be rapping. Rack city is ok, but come on how many times can you listen to it? The entire album is just the run of the mill \\"I'm going to use trap beats and sound gangster, snap back raps,an occasional girl song, european brainwashed pop synthesized nonsense. Every song on this album is below a 4 star rating. Some are just too unbearable.
0345803485|2.0|I cannot give a one star review to any book, no matter how pointless. As a struggling writer, I admire anyone who can produce a finished book, regardless of whether I like it or not. However, I am still shaking my head over this novel and the attention and devotion it has caused. Other than the frequent and descriptive sex scenes, there is not much about this book that makes it noteworthy or compelling.<br /><br />I can't say I wasn't warned. My poor review is not based on the subject matter (BDSM) or the titillating nature of the writing. If anything, I was disappointed because the writing didn't live up to the promise of the subject matter - innocence corrupted. And I was disappointed that there was no resolution to the story arc, such as it was.<br /><br />Ana's inner dialogue was perhaps the most irritating aspect of the book. The author knew enough to design multiple, varied sex scenes, but never figured out how to use multiple, varied words and phrases to narrate her main character's thoughts. Ana is truly a broken record. Her character, a college graduate hoping to go to work in publishing, thinks in monosyllabic italics. Oh, my and Whoa seem to describe her deepest thoughts. And she interrupts the sexual action every few seconds to tell the reader what she is thinking. She is usually thinking Oh, my.<br /><br />I was told it was erotic fiction, racy, smut, trash, soft porn - call it what you will - so I was prepared for the sexual nature of the book. I don't disapprove or object on that basis.<br /><br />My problem is 95% with the abysmally poor writing. The other 5% of my disappointment is that there was no \\"payoff\\" or \\"twist\\" that made my patience worthwhile. The ending came as a blessed relief.<br /><br />Without a doubt, some of the sex scenes are memorable, but in hindsight only. Ana's inner dialogue, play-by-play narration and narrow, repetitive powers of description detracted greatly from the building action.<br /><br />I'm glad to know firsthand whatthe fuss is about, so in that sense I'm not sorry I took the time to read the book. However, I certainly won't bother with Shades 2 and 3.

0345803485|1.0|It felt like the author had a list of 200 word that she reconfigured over and over again in slightly different order.as others have mentioned, the inner goddess thing was beyond irritating.<br /><br />Reading this made me worry, a lot, for anyone between 14-24 who reads this book. Talk about unrealistic expectations - a billionaire who showers his lady with a laptop, car, etc. then layer on the abusive relationship (and it is physically and emotionally abusive), it makes it seem that being beaten and manipulated is okay, as long as he buys you stuff and you share a hot sex life.<br /><br /> I cannot believe this was written by an adult, and am embarrassed that I paid for the book.

0066620996|5.0|Collins clearly describes the six stages that companies must have if they want to go big. I believe everyone should read this book whether you own a company or just a regular employee in a company. The ideas that are given in this book will stimulate your leadership sense and perhaps it will enable you to bring your company ahead of the competitors. Collins spent nearly five years in comparing the mediocre companies with great companies. One most notable difference is on how the level 5 leader responds to each situation that the company faces. This book will help you to understand that a company become big not is not because the skilled salesperson nor huge investment in advertising, but it is simply because the great CEO that bring the company into such success. Other than the emphasized key point, the level 5 leader, the reader will get these knowledge benefits:<br />- First Who..then What.. it's the idea about getting the right people in your team before the team can move forward, and how character beats skill.<br />- Companies' culture discipline, and how the technology are insignificant factors in determining a company success.<br />- The flywheel and doomloop effect which are very crucial to be understood in order to gain momentum to get the company moving forward.<br />In short, if anyone out there really want to stand out among other peers or companies, this book will give you how to get there.

B003DT194G|5.0|Not only is this Sergio Leone's masterpiece, it forever changed the way westerns were written and filmed.  Before Leone, there were good guys and bad guys, black and white.  Leone has characters, all of whom are flawed.  You never are sure who is a good guy and who is a bad guy, and often the hero is simply the best of the bad guys.  The cinematography is very large and nothing was spared to make each scene a feast for the eyes.  The soundtrack is integral to the story as well.  There are so many little \\"mini movies\\" within the whole movie, it is often fun just to watch segments of the movie alone to study the details in each set-up.
B0063IH60K|5.0|awesome game! very fun to play on the kindle fire! love solitaire and this game makes it possible to enjoy it everywhere
B0063IH60K|4.0|it's free it has good game play it is worth a press of a skip button for another app or a quick 15 second ad to have a great time killer two thumbs up :)<br />hay for free apps
0307592731|4.0|I tend to read a lot of trave adventure stories and have reached a point in which they are all starting to sound similar. Wild provided several unexpected switchbacks along the way. Stray's casual style of writing lent to a relaxed read. The combination of diary style of reflection and humorous highlights truly created a feel of being out on the trail. It was a story filled with struggle and triumph. I love that it offered a wonderful snapshot into a woman's perspective on long distance backpacking. From realistically questioning the limits of ones physical abilities to the fanciful thinking that just the right outfit and a dab of scented essential oil is enough create a blissful world of love and romance. Wild takes you through the low valleys of loss and death to the spectacular peaks of shattering your beliefs of the impossible.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Finished Fifty shades of grey last night and it was truly awful!!!  Possibly the worst<br />book I have ever read....<br /><br />However I was wondering if perhaps I was just being prudish or picky or whatever<br />so I checked out the amazon book reviews.<br /><br />I can now say that it was worth reading if only because I am officially a member<br />of that very special amazon club, about 1/2 of all reviewers who rated it one<br />star.  Honestly if I could rate it a black hole (no word play intended here) I<br />would because it was that bad.<br /><br />However, the amazon customers who have taken the time to give this novel (I use<br />that term loosely) the critique it deserves are some of the most authentic and<br />hilarious writers I have had the pleasure of reading in a long time.<br /><br />I was forced to stop reading their comments on public transportation  because my<br />uncontrollable laughter was disturbing everyone else!<br /><br />I am well read but only for leisure and have never considered myself very<br />knowledgable about what good writing is.  That is until I read this book.  From<br />now on I will know it when I read it!  I can almost guarantee that<br />this tome will become the go to example for writing professors all over the<br />world for how not to write a novel!<br /><br />Thank you to el James for writing the worst novel of the new millennium and<br />giving all these reviewers so much material to work with.. Jeez....oh<br />crap.....gotta go!
0439023491|4.0|Collins delivers another nail-biter in Catching Fire.  I could not wait to rip open this, the second of the series, after the Hunger Games.  I was not disappointed.  We meet Katniss again, who is now slightly beaten down, but she continues to fight on for another day.<br /><br />The sickening plot twist at the beginning of the book, to put the victors back in the ring, was very clever.  You immediately starting thinking: can she do it again?  Can she find a way to survive?  But this time, there are more things for her to consider when she's fighting for life.<br /><br />I was still distracted by the writing style of the book and couldn't bring myself to give 5 stars, but I truly enjoyed it and breezed through it in less than 24 hours!
0345803485|1.0|This is nothing but unbelievable hard core porn and written very poorly at that.  I'm ashamed that we've made this a bestseller and are rewarding the author.  It doesn't say much for us readers.  When there is so much excellent reading available, why anyone would waste their time on this nonsense is beyond me. I could write pages on how poorly this is written and how unbelievable the characters are, but it isn't worth my time.
0439023521|5.0|It is not often that I don't love the main character and yet feel so attached to her.  In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is strong, intelligent individual and sometimes that is somewhat off-putting.  But in her world, there is no room for sentimental feelings.  She is a survivor for herself and for her family.<br /><br />I found the story fascinating and compelling.  I turned the page faster and faster as I read on, desperate to find out how the story would end.  The characters are believable.<br /><br />The only thing I did not enjoy was the writing style.  To me, it was choppy and difficult to read at times.  I found myself reading one sentence three times before I understood the meaning.  I would have rated the book 4.5 stars, but since I couldn't, I rounded up.  Overall, I thought it was quite brilliant!
B005DESVPO|5.0|Saw Gary Clark Jr. live and had to have this CD in my collection. Can't wait for more Gary Clark Jr.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|This album is not for everyone.  It's minimalist, smooth, and not what everyone wants to hear around the Christmas tree.  I loved it, though.  I didn't know what to expect when I bought it but I love Zooey Deschanel.  The album was exactly what I wanted.  Perfect for sitting around watching the snow fall and sipping a glass of wine.<br /><br />My favorite song was probably \\"The Christmas Waltz.\\"  Not that many people cover it but it's so very dreamy when these two come together.  You really do feel like waltzing.  My least favorite song is \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,\\" but this is probably because it is my absolute favorite Christmas song.  I have much higher standards for this song and this version was a little too dreary for me.<br /><br />Overall, I adore this album and highly recommend it if you like a velvety voice covering some Christmas classics!
B0086700CM|5.0|It was kind of hard at first but once you get the hang of it it is really easy. It is a great game for car trips and everyone has fun playing it. I love Temple Run!!!
B007URVZJ6|2.0|After following the instructions on this book, I ended up with a poorly formatted ebook with no table of contents. So I dug about online, and found a freeware EPUB WYSIWYG editor called Sygil. It forced me into some HTML/ CSS, which I am fluent in. From there, I used Amazon's \\"Kindle Previewer\\" to translate the EPUB into a MOBI file.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this is a good game for anyone.  Be sure to have some spare time.  Great for killing some time.  Hard to put down once you start.......
B0082KPF32|5.0|This is the heaviest and most beautiful album I've heard.<br />If you are a fan of heavy music you need to get this album.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't decide if I wanted to see the movie or not so bought the books instead. Once I started reading I couldn't put the books down. Usually when books go into great detail describing who what where or when, I lose interest but I found the descriptions of the districts, the pre-game preparations, the games and the players themselves to be excellent. I could almost see and feel what the author was describing. I have to admit I was a little down when I finished the trilogy; not because there wasn't another book to read but because I was wondering how far from the truth the story really was. Are we on the path to this very world? In any case, a very interesting read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really wish we wouldn't have to pay for the premium package. it would be nice to have more options but other than that its a great application. also the radar is messed up sometimes and is a bit annoying.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think Temple Run is fun because you try to outrun a group of monkeys, which are my favorite animals.

014241722X|4.0|I like the murder mystery and boy main character in Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer. I read it as it will be on a best books list for my school next year. The characters and descriptions were rich. I also liked how all the details tied up at the end and I suspect kids will too. However, the age listed on the book is 8 - 12. I don't know many 8 year olds, let alone 10 year olds that would be that interested in all the law descriptions. The action lagged in parts and it seemed the main character was more interested in the courtroom scenes than the reader. All in all, I enjoyed the book myself, but have reservations for kids. I do think it will hit the spot for some lawyer want-a-be's out there, just don't know how many readers that is.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Virtual City Playground is really fun! I love it! I think the only drawback to the game is the speed in which you get the money you need for the objectives. It can take a long time to be able to buy some of the buildings you need to buy.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This book is really awesome, but it starts out pretty slow. But that's not the reason I gave it 4 stars. On the x-ray thing, There is no Eponine, which is  a bit dissapointing for all of those 'Ponine fans out there. Just a warning. Also try reading the  book before watching the musical or movie. Foor the movie, don't watch the one starring Liam Neeson. He's really great but the plot is messed up. The musical is AWESOME .<br /><br />P.S. The  Friends of the A B C are pretty cool. Especially Ennjolras.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|This documentary is a wonderful look into the life of George Harrison, the Beatles, and many other musicians.  I recommend it to everyone.

B000AMJC2K|3.0|I purchased two of these for dual monitors. The product would probably work well for a single monitor, but it's utter hell trying to align two monitors. This is because the various freedoms the product gives you to rotate the monitors on the arms are not at right angles to each other, and so changing the angle of a monitor is a frustrating process of trial and error where each change requires swiveling two joints. Swiveling the joints also changes the height of the monitor a bit, so you need to go and adjust that as well. The height adjustment is not continuous; you hold in a button on the elbow and then can change the angle of the arm up or down to various steps. That, of course, also changes the tilt of the monitor, so now you have to swivel the aforementioned joints again, which might end up throwing off the height, and the whole process repeats. Finally, whenever you do get the monitor to the correct height, angle and tilt, you have to rotate it to restore it to a horizontal orientation. That, at least, is straightforward and won't require re-adjusting the height or angle.<br /><br />All this is to say that it is eventually possible to get a satisfactory setup, but these are not monitor arms that will allow you to reposition the monitors on a whim. Any change will require fighting with the arms (ideally from behind) for a few minutes. I haven't seen anything better for the price, but I'm really kicking myself for not shelling out for a better model.
B0086700CM|5.0|its a really good game and very addictive, the gradphics are pretty cool too. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something fun and addictive.
B004JMRDQE|5.0|I actually went to school with Pruitt. I love this movie. Quirky and kind of strange but still an awesome movie. It shows that people CAN be caring on this earth, even though these days it doesn't seem like it. I'd love to see Pruitt do more movies like this. He really is a good actor!
B000OVLINI|5.0|Beautifully written with everything you could want in a story. The beginning can be a little slow but stick with it because the second half is enthralling. I highly recommend this fantastic book!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first the library in my area had Fifty Shades, removed it from the library, but after much controversy and a petition it is back on the shelf.  I may not agree with some of the things in the book, but now I have read all three, and hated for it to end. I approached it with an open mind, and found it an interesting series of books. I gave it as a gift to a couple of friends, because several did not want to read it after listening to the gossip in our area. So glad for my Amazon Kindle , it made the reading easy, because It takes up little space and is convenient.
B000002PCS|5.0|Very beautiful and classical of all time. I really love this movie and music. A must for Somewhere in Time's fan
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is one of those games that is something you constantly play! its should be on the list of best games of all time. and another thing, ITS FREE! soo give it a try
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I remain a big fan but my loyalty and my endurance were severally tested reading books 4 & 5. Too many peripheral characters...a reader would have to keep genealogy notes to keep all of them straight in ones mind. The story simply got lost in the deluge of secondary characters & descriptions.<br /><br />George Martin brought the main characters to life in the first four books but in the last two, the main characters I have grown to appreciate became footnotes. When the main characters did appear, they were ineffectual and had very little influence in moving the story along.<br /><br />To give Martin the benefit of the doubt, I re-read books 4 & 5 (I must be a masochist...) I came away every bit as confused and disappointed as the first reading left me.<br /><br />I can only hope that the next installment of Game Of Thrones somehow ties all of these characters and sub-plots together in a way I can understand.  Reading good fiction and fantasy should not be a penance a reader must endure.
B0086700CM|5.0|i am sooo happy i was looking for this sence chritmas!!!!! i ended up down loading this app from a website but it did not work as well finally they have it for the kindle. i love this game! my kindle is now complete! i am soooo happy!!!!!! yay! this game is so fun i am soo happy! EVERYONE SHOULD GET THIS GAME! EVERYONE! :)
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Even though I had read reviews myself when ordering Cinder, I somehow missed that there were going to be more books.  I guess The Lunar Chronicles somehow didn't resonate with me... Imagine my surprise then when I got to the end, and it left me hanging!  I was so disappointed but excited too because if I like a particular character or characters, then I don't want to stop reading about them.  This is how I felt about Cinder.  Cinder, as the name implies, is a futuristic version of the classic tale Cinderella.  In this version, Cinder does still have two step-sisters and a step-mother, but Cinder herself is half human and half cyborg which I thought was a pretty interesting twist.  The story takes place in a far off future in New Bejing, 126 years after World War IV. Cinder is known around New Bejing as one of the best mechanics and instead of her animal critter friends, Cinder has Iko the android as her sidekick.  While at the market where her work booth is set up, Cinder is visited by Prince Kai who wants her to fix his android.  Cinder is curious as to why the Prince wants the android fixed instead of updating to a newer and more current model.  Prince Kai jokes about the android having information that is top secret, but Cinder guesses there is some truth in his tale.  There is a deadly plague killing off the human population at an alarming speed, and when Cinder's step-sister and closest friend, Peony, becomes sick, she will do everything she can to find a cure.  Cinder's step-mother offers up Cinder as a research subject and it is discovered that Cinder is somehow immune to the plague.  The doctor in charge of researching the plague becomes a surprising ally and convinces Cinder that they must keep her immunity a secret for the time being.  Cinder goes along with him and continues to work on a plan of escape from her wicked stepmother. The evil Queen, Levana, from Luna a moon colony whose inhabitants are known as Lunars and have special powers to make others believe and see what they want them to, wants to marry the Prince so she may become ruler of all the Earthen colonies.  The people on Earth are very distrustful and a bit scared of the Lunars because of their abilities. As the story unfolds, it isn't too difficult to clue into where it is heading and put some of the puzzle pieces together.  Even so, I found the story to be entertaining and enjoyable and it was easy to get through.  Cinder is a tough character and stands up for herself against her stepmother and doesn't generally care what others think about her although she does try to hide the fact that she is cyborg from the Prince.  Iko adds a nice mix of humor as her sidekick and has a sarcastic side which is entertaining coming from an android.  I loved the story and look forward to reading the next book.lieve and see what they want them to, wants to marry the Prince so she may become ruler of all the Earthen colonies.

B000HF0IIC|4.0|If you didn't see the movie you won't get the joke. Jim Carrey is really the only man who could play the riddler. They're both so over the top they were made for eachother. I liked this movie. I prefered the first two but they still kept up a good quality here. however, watching the deleted scenes helps piece the missing parts of the movie together and make it even better.

B000RH0C8G|4.0|Like the author who runs a world, or the collector who conjures one in a bottle, many a modern baseball fan wants to create their own team or league, and the Internet has super-enabled this rotisserie spirit. At the base is the drive to call the tune. It is the motive in the heart of Oakland Athletics' general manager Billy Beane, as depicted in Michael Lewis' Moneyball. It depicts the flowering of a statistically-centered approach to baseball player strategy that has been trending up in recent years. It is a new way of figuring out \\"what will happen.\\"<br /><br />This was a very good film with very able Brad Pitt. The film's producers and Pitt very wisely made Beane a real dramatic hero, while in the book he is more an example of way of thinking about predictability. Vis-&agrave;-vis the film, the book is less a story, more a collection of scenes, in the form of New Journalism, Lewis is embedded in the Oakland Athletics front office. In episodes he tells what he saw. He gets inside Billy Beane's mind. Well, Billy tells him stuff and then he presents it in the form \\"Beane thought...\\"<br /><br />I think in an Afterward to the paperback edition Lewis explains his objectives. 1-The book is about \\"putting together a baseball team.\\" 2- He was \\"writing a book about the collision of reason and baseball.\\" 3- It's not a biography of a man. \\"It was more like the biography of an idea.\\"<br /><br />If you like baseball, if you like thoughtful business books, you will likely like Moneyball, which is a combination of the two.<br /><br />Some notes: Beane was a talented prospect with a temperament that failed him, leaving him short of the top ranks of players. This, however, gave him a unique view on how to manage the business of player acquisition. Lewis positions the A's as the first chief MLB proponent of a type of statistical analysis that emerged in rotisserie league and Xerox zine circles of the 1970s and 1980s. As I'd suggest, this got hyperbolically extenuated by the Web. The interest here is the statistics of baseball, the game behind the game - that was initially set in motion by the mimeographed missives of one Bill James - a night watchman who's unique fixation on baseball statistics created a whole new ulterior mirror-reality version of the national pastime. [For me it is akin to the imaginary baseball league of the youthful great writer Jack Kerouac.]He fixed on which stats really mattered - at least one of these is now really a popular way to judge the game, that is: on base percentage. But the story is driven by the protagonist Beame, the phenom in middle age, a guy with a job to do, a limited budget, and a maniacal aversion to the conventional wisdom who doesnt quite grab the prize but who damn sure competes.<br /><br />Highlights:<br />Bill is ... \\"the guy who knows what's going to happen even before it does...\\" - p. 191<br />\\"If you have twelve different pitchers you have to speak twelve different languages.\\" - p.  252<br />\\"The Internet was good at gathering people together from different places with common interests.\\"  - p. 235 [As Lewis writes this is one of the Internet's fundamental elements. A point that would not interest you unless you care to re-visit first principals, which one of the topics of the book btw.]<br /><br />Page numbers refer to Norton paperback, 2004 edition?rest here is the statistics of baseball, the game behind the game - that was initially set in motion by the mimeographed missives of one Bill James - a night watchman who's unique fixation on baseball statistics created a whole new ulterior mirror-reality version of the national pastime.

B000WEMH3C|1.0|We live in Maryland and keep our grill on our deck, out of direct sunlight.  This cover split and cracked in less than two years.  The material is not made to withstand being outdoors in our relatively mild climate.  It's inexpensive because it doesn't last.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is epic although there is only one level to set a high score on.  Also the graphics are good. But they should make a scene character to choose(: I finally saved up ten thousand gold and went to buy barry bones but since i was in a car i accidentaly bought a ginger girl instead.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a game I knew that would be great when it did come out for aneroid app store. it took a while but it was worth the wait!

B004EPYZUS|5.0|This was great. The action was awesome. Some of the technology was neat too. This Mission impossible was better than the 3rd Mission Impossible. But not better than the first one or the second one. It starts off with Ethan hunt in a russian prison. the tricks used to get him out were neat too. The colapse of the Kremlin was neato to watch. The death defying climbing scene outside the skyscraper was neato to watch too. This film is filled with plenty of action for the whole family to watch. It may be too much for little children though. Like 5-10 year olds. That's to be left to your descretion. It's PG-13 but I didn't see anything that would be too much for kids. The kids will probably enjoy it more than the adults will. All in all it was a great film to watch and enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|its a game that's just really fun to kill time like in a long car ride and its NOT a battery killer. get this app
B004LWZW8I|3.0|Immortals was a good movie. Not the best though. I was entertained and enjoyed Mickey Rourke's performance. Its an action adventure. John Hurt was good too. I hardly remember much about the film as it was not memorable. I do know that I enjoyed the action. You need a certain ammount of belief in the idea of gods and goddesses. If you can get into the concept of Mythology having an effect on the human mind you might enjoy it. But it doesn't focus on the stories of the gods. It focuses on the power mad king Hyperion who wants a magical weapon to dominate the world but Theseus stops him. There were some great scenes with the magical bow that shoots arrows of pure energy.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is adicting and it is very fun and wildly crazy I love this game when iget my kindle I always play this game
0321356683|5.0|It requires serious reading, I keep going back to this title even after 3 years. Sometimes it reminds me reading the textbook in the college.
B004LROMQG|1.0|Never got past the first disc.  It would play for awhile and then go back to the disc loading process. Then you had to go thru the beginning all over again till you got to the movie and then try to find out where you were in the chapter selection feature.  Not just once, sometimes three times per episode.  Quality control is the pits on this one.  I sent mine back for a refund.  I will say Amazon is a great place to buy.  They really take care of their customers.
B0086700CM|4.0|I got this game because it was popular on the ipod but it is fun and addictive! Totally love it! Favorite game!

0307730697|5.0|I cannot remember that last book that made me literally laugh out loud then cry a few pages later. I cannot remember a book that has tested my faith quite like this one. The faith and strength of every person in this book amazes me. How God can weave the lives of the broken into a beautiful love story shouldn't surprise me but it's just wonderful. How God can take a man who hit rock bottom and make him an example of perfect love shouldn't baffle me but it's truly amazing. This is a book you don't want to miss. A story of a man who gave everything. Fearless by Eric Blehm.<br /><br />It's the legacy of one of our most elite military personnel. It's the faith his family carried through hell and back many times over. It's the peace and healing God brings in the darkest times in our lives. It's a story worth reading.<br /><br />Adam Brown had a can do attitude since he was little. He never backed down, cared deeply, defended the helpless, and loved like no other. From standing up for a boy with Downs Syndrome to providing shoes to Afghan children, Adam Brown was a hero when he was just doing what he felt in his heart was right. Fearless traces his rise to stardom in high school to his darkest days with drug addiction to redemption through his ultimate sacrifice. Adam became one of the greatest SEALs our nation has ever seen or had the honor of calling one of our own. All through this story his drive is evident. His determination to break free of his addiction. His push to enter the Navy despite his record. He blew through training to reach the top of his class. He would give up himself to protect his teammates during raids. And eventually gave his life for his friends, who he called family, during one of the most difficult and important terrorist raids. And he understood his sacrifice, his ultimate calling.Through all of this his friends and family who are telling his story define him with one word: FEARLESS.<br /><br />\\"I'm not afraid of anything that might happen to meon this earth because I know no matter what, nothing can take my spirit away from me...\\"<br /><br />Adam Brown wrote these words in a letter to his children that was to be read only if the worst happened. These are the words of faith from a truly fearless man.

0062071017|5.0|This is my first review. I attended HBS OPM course. Cynthia lead us on a deep, profound understanding of strategy in business and, for me, in life.  This book supports and challenges you in creating uniqueness in business and life like no other book I have ever read.  Go on, make a real difference - this book is your roadmap.
B0086700CM|1.0|i love this app on my ipod and i was so excited when i saw it but when i downoaded it, it will not even open! i am very upset.
0736092269|5.0|This is the best book on exercise physiology ever. Detailed drawings by a medical illustrator (who is also a bodybuilder) show HOW the muscles work during numerous exercises. The book is organized by body part, so, for example, you can turn to the section on the chest and find numerous exercises for that muscle group, and the drawings illustrate exactly which muscles are used as well as the mechanics behind the movements.  It also illustrates proper form.  If you are serious about weight training, there is no better book to be found.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had it on my ipod and loved it! I was hoping it would come on this its really nice to have it on here.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Prologue<br /><br />Albino Watchman downs a caviar/tequila slammer next to a waterfall then disintegrates into the stream. Project Mankind or a renegade's gift to the third rock?<br /><br />Project Prometheus<br /><br />Sci-fi epic, 33yrs in the making, turns out to be a two hour, 500 yard shuttle run between two spaceships.<br />The loose mythological core mirrors Prometheus (Space Jockey), his gift of fire to humans (evolution via Black DNA Caviar), and his subsequent punishment by the Gods (genetic vengeance via the Evil Caviar).<br />Hence we have a Clash of the Titans: White Super Engineers vs. Evil Black Goo, with Mankind, the accidental product, caught in the middle. I could try to explain the story to you, but here's a better idea:  You explain it to me...<br /><br />Fire (DNA Caviar)<br /><br />Location: Planet LV-226; Space Jockey stomping ground. In a cemetery of thermos flasks, in a worm infested H.R. Giger museum. This caviar is genetic plutonium, primordial evil, the evolutionary fire of the gods.<br /><br />This black temple introduces the film's heart of darkness: the consequence of playing God. Humans invent androids because they can. Engineers invent humans because they can, but the unexplained question is, why then try destroy us? Fassbender's android gifts us the closest answer: \\"To create you must first destroy\\". So is our black caviar the evolutionary equivalent of a forest fire, and its purpose the purification of the gene pool? If not purification, then perhaps weaponisation, with humans as guinea pigs? But 2,000 years seems an awfully long manufacturing period. And let's be honest, why not just build a Death Star?<br /><br />The most sensible explanation seems that, after their experiment turns on them, the Engineers realise that the black goo is inherently evil (d'uh!) and Mankind, an evolutionary vessel of said evil, becomes an experimental error they seek to rectify through genocide. But why lead us to LV-226 in order to destroy us? Similar wall paintings from civilisations centuries apart suggest repeated visits to Earth. Why not just destroy us at home? Likely the original invitation was a peaceful one, prior to the caviar uprising. Alternative explanations include a lone stranded Prometheus Engineer with a life spanning millenia (where is he now?), or, following the evolutionary weapon theory, the 2000 years delay could, in essence, be cooking time for the optimum genetic recipe, awaiting our technological advance to interstellar travel.<br /><br />Here now is a quick recap of the Xenomorph life cycle:<br />Queen - Eggs - Facehugger - Chestburster - Xeno<br /><br />Not content with the biological plausibility of this, the screenwriters of Prometheus have added the following variations:<br /><br />DNA Caviar + worm = Vagina Cobra<br />DNA Caviar + champagne + archaeologist = Zombie<br />Zombie + sexy time = Woman + baby squid<br />Little baby squid + a few hours = Giant Kraken<br />Kraken + Space Jockey = Skinny Mocha Xeno<br /><br />Prometheus<br /><br />Elephant masks? Really? Over 30 years I've developed a fondness for the Space Jockeys as herbivore stargazers. Turns out it's just a suit.<br />For a race of interstellar engineers, the elephant look seems a little dated. If they're only helmets, why are they wearing them indoors, on a spaceship, on a planet with an atmosphere breathable for them? Maybe they're for navigational purposes, but then why would the holocaust pile-up victims in the corridor be wearing them?<br />Continuity whores take note: How can the original space jockey with a fully intact mask, have a chestburster hole in his sternum? Which hole was the point of entry, if not through the mouth? Butthuggers, anybody?<br /><br />Next question: What does LV stand for? 226 is not 426 but both have (apparently multiple) crashed croissant ships carrying mutilated Engineers, indicating that the outbreak was spontaneous and galaxy wide. This in turn suggesting that the DNA Caviar was no hand-me-down recipe amongst the Engineers, and the Engineers are not nearly as clever as you think.<br /><br />Even before we reach the thermos cemetery, the questions outweigh the answers. What was chasing the Engineers? Why did their chests burst? Not even the vagina cobra causes chest-bursting, only the huggers (kracken or face) can do it. So are the huggers only ever the result of a female gestation (Noomi Rapace, the Aliens Bitch Queen or, in this case, the female Engineers?).<br /><br />Casting<br /><br />Remember the colonial marines of the starship Sulaco. Vasquez, Hudson, Drake, Frost... how could you forget, right?<br />Now Prometheus: name the captain? (clue: it's not \\"Idris Elba\\"). How about Noomi's boyfriend? The two stranded scientists or the oriental co-pilot? I'll tell you what their names are: Fodder, Filler, Token, Guy Person and Chang.<br />Ok, I made the last one up. Thanks Lindelof. Go ahead and throw in the fat guy with curly hair. You know you want to.<br /><br />For those of you riding the Fassbender bandwagon, allow me to set your canvas roof on fire. Ask yourself this: How does his android compare to Lance Henriksen or Ian Holm? It's a no brainer. Henriksen>Holm>Fassbender>Winona Ryder. Swap the first two if you will, but Fassbender beats only the elfin girl-child. As for his finale... another talking-head? Really?<br /><br />Special mention has to go to the Direction, Cinematography, Costumes, CGI and set design, which are all engineered to perfection, and completely let down by the script.<br /><br />Finally a section I like to call...<br /><br />WTFLOLMFAOMG<br /><br />1. Android attempts fluent Space Jockese, by studying ancient human texts? Did you just call his mother a slag? Don't lose your head over it.<br /><br />2. Guy Pearce acting as an old man? Why not use...AN OLD MAN!<br /><br />3. Heavy face and neck padding on Guy Pearce? Why not use...A FAT OLD MAN!<br /><br />4. David deciphers every control code at first touch. Hey Engineers, stop using \\"password\\" as your password.<br /><br />5. Engineer 1. \\"Gentlemen I'm tired of pushing buttons. Any new ideas on how activate this navigation deck?\\"<br />Engineer 2. \\"Well, I used to play the flute.\\"<br />Engineer 1. \\"Good work soldier. Now lets go eat some more of that delicious caviar.\\"<br /><br />6. Engineer 1. \\"Mmm, that caviar was tasty. Now how about we install that new holographic security system.\\"<br />Engineer 2. \\"But Sir, it only has an 8-bit graphics card, and the intruder tracking doesn't work\\"<br />Engineer 1. \\"Have you farted?\\"<br /><br />7. Oh my god, Weyland is her father!!! So maybe that means they're going to...<br />Oh wait, they're all dead. So it doesn't matter.<br /><br />8. Hey Dr. Grey, you've just discovered that the human race is threatened and you have access to an alien craft. Do you...<br />a) Use it to race back to earth, and use the alien tech to construct the human defence.<br />b) Confront the entire alien species on your own, with a severed robot head in a duffel bag<br /><br />The more I write for this review, the less I seem to care. Yet I've been up most of the night figuring this out. At the very least I hope it helps you guys from going through the same. In closing I must borrow from another review who states simply that the sheer number of questions is a testament to the failure of the scriptwriters. Or maybe just one of them.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a must have. This is the reason you bought a smart phone...to run this game. Dl this now.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. it is fun and intertaining. it keeps my kids busy while I make lunch or dinner.

0525478817|5.0|I've just finished reading The Fault in Our Stars. I've had the book since its release, but decided to wait until I had the time to give the attention it deserves. It was hard to stay away from spoilers, but I'm glad I managed to do it quite successfully.<br /><br />This is one of those books that, as soon as you start reading, you know it's a rare thing. The stars align and it all works. I'm deeply touched by the story, the characters, the discussions, and the way John presents these very complex thoughts with tender simplicity. It flows beautifully.<br /><br />I can't recommend it enough. Actually, I purchased copies of the book and gave them to some of my closest friends, so as to make sure they'll read it. It meant a great deal to me, and I'm sure it'll mean a lot to everyone who takes the time to discover it.

0345803485|1.0|Bad writing!  The only reason I read this book so quickly was because I was able to skim page after page of absolute crap.  You have to be kidding me!  Do yourself a favor.  Read the synopsis from all three books and the reviews before wasting any money unless you absolutely love porn.  The characters are unrealistic, the plot is poor, and the writer constantly repeats phrases... oh my!  But hey, it's selling millions!
0345803485|5.0|Because the initial hype sparked my curiosity, I bought the trilogy, plodded through the first hundred pages, got caught up in the play-by-play erotica, but ultimately became bored with  the repetition.  When I decided to skip over the repetition, I enjoyed  the unfolding of the predictable, happily-ever-after fairy tale.

0345803485|5.0|Fifty Shades is a fun and sexy read,  you will blush one moment and laugh the next!  I started with the first book and became obsessed until I had finished all three.  The only problem you will find is that any book you try to pick up after this trilogy is going to fall short.  I've tried some of the books recommended by those that say if you liked Fifty Shades of Grey you will like such and such book but so far nothing has even come close.  Ana is such a likable, relatable heroine,  her inner goddess was hilarious.  Christian is the handsome and very tortured hero,  he has a dominate personality but with a vulnerability that softens his character.  I loved this story!
B00571F26Y|4.0|I don't know where to begin in telling you how amazing the transformation is in my body and my health after following the advice in this book. I am a cardiac nurse with 20 years of experience, and tend to be sceptic with every new diet which comes around the bend. I am not overweight, nor have I ever been. My frame is very small and in my teens I weighed 115 to 120. Four kids and thirty years later, I have tried everything to budge the scale which has stuck solid at 135 since I was in my late twenties. I have done Atkins, Sugar Busters, exercise, Eat Right For Your Blood Type, and a few other diets which I have since forgotten. Atkins was the only one which I had success in losing the weight, however, it was a brutal, very difficult diet, and I suffered extremely from cravings and starvation feelings. I also did not like that I had to think about \\"what will I eat for my next meal?\\" constantly. AND, as soon as I let up a bit on the Atkins, the weight came back double. So when I saw the title \\"Wheat Belly\\" I was intrigued, as the little fat roll belly I have had for so many years needed a name, and I thought that might make a good name for it!<br /><br />My initial reading of the book left me feeling like I had found the truth of things as to why this very health conscious, very exercise-fanatic culture of ours was the fattest, most unhealthy civilization the US has ever seen. Another point he made was why were our mothers so trim? Fifty years ago, the moms of the day did not go to yoga class, jog through the neighborhood, and attend Zoomba. Can you see Mrs. Cleaver putting on her leotard? haha. small joke. I was also a bit startled to read that wheat acts as an exorphin by crossing the blood brain barrier and acting on the pleasure centers of our brains to set us up for feelings of pleasure followed by withdrawals and cravings. WEll duh!! That is exactly my eating pattern for YEARS! No matter how good I intended to be, I could not overcome my cravings when something yummy was an option.<br /><br />I read this book in March. At the time, I had already kicked my sugar addiction and replaced it with Lakanto (waaayy better and tastier than Truvia!!) I had eradicated High Fructose Corn Syrup from my diet as well. And I was a pescatarian. (no meat/only fish). I had not lost a single pound. I weighed 137 lbs on day one of the Wheat Belly Diet. I went cold turkey off the wheat, focusing on veggies, fish, nuts, eggs, cheese, dairy, other grains besides wheat, and small amounts of fruit, rice, corn, and potatoes. I learned to eat whole foods, and stayed away from anything in a box, can or package. And I was careful to not go crazy with portion sizes on things like starches. The first few days were difficult, as I felt I was constantly racking my brain as to what I could eat. I utilized the Lose It! app on my Android to track my meals and calories. After the first couple of days, something amazing began to happen. I BEGAN TO LOSE WEIGHT! My fat little belly roll became less and less dense. And flatter and flatter. And even more amazingly, I LOST MY CRAVINGS. This is the absolute miracle of this diet. Once you are off wheat, you do not crave the wheat. I am now down to 123 lbs, and am completely stoked and sold on this lifestyle. I never want to eat wheat again!! There are too many good foods out there and lots of options for substituting. I have had extremely tasty gluten free pizzas, and made gluten free Coconut Shrimp, and even Gluten free cakes and cookies! *I substitute the Lakanto for the sugar. I have shared this incredible find with many of my patients at the hospital. Many who are obese, have diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, etc. I feel terrific and most importantly, I do not feel deprived in any way whatsoever. I love how my clothes fit me now, and love the flat belly and no-more-muffin-top look. My husband is super-stoked, and my adult kids are impressed. (because they know how long I have tried to get this weight off!)<br/><br />So YES, I would say, GET THIS BOOK ANY WAY YOU CAN, READ IT AND FOLLOW IT!! It will change your life, and could SAVE your life! The reason I gave it only four stars is simply because I was a bit disappointed with the amount of eating ideas included in the back. Because the first thing anyone will think when they do something like the Wheat Belly Diet is \\"What Can I eat??\\" So I felt he should have included a lot more ideas, menus, and meals. Just my perspective. Get this book. Now./><br />So YES, I would say, GET THIS BOOK ANY WAY YOU CAN, READ IT AND FOLLOW IT!! It will change your life, and could SAVE your life!

This is heavy Metal at its finest. Buy them both!

0345803485|2.0|I'm not going to finish this book because half way in, I've read enough.  Perhaps I shouldn't have read that this was originally a Twilight fanfiction, but then I wouldn't have read it in the first place.  The problem I have with it, besides the clumpy dialogue, is that it's too similar to Twilight.  It's easy to see who the characters were modeled after.<br /><br />Ana is Bella.  The blank slate of a person readers are supposed to model themselves into  so they can feel all giddy in their romantic parts.  And she's an awkward character, the reasons Grey falls for her is just as weak as Twilight because they're the same reasons.<br /><br />At one point she's like, \\"What do you see in me?\\" and he's like, \\"You're interesting when you blush.\\"  Dangit, that was kind of a big plot point in Twilight.<br /><br />So for me, the problem is, is that it's unoriginal in that the characters are pretty much the same as Twilight but tossed in a new environment.  It's a common fanfiction ploy, I dunno why it made it into a published book.

B00846REIS|4.0|I'm a bit torn on this one. On the one hand, the author told a really good story. On the other hand, it was a very familiar story. People all over the net have been calling this the closest to Fifty Shades of Grey that they have found, and they are kind of right, kind of not.<br /><br />I think this book did the sex scenes better, I think this book was written better. Unfortunately, I didn't come to love the characters in this one as much. I didn't connect as well, and I didn't really buy the changes we saw supposedly occur.<br /><br />Eva is very different from what I expected. She isn't shy, she isn't demure, she knows what she wants, and she goes after it. Even sex. But in one way, she's like most heroines, she's very insecure, but she has a lot of reasons to be that way.<br /><br />Gideon is VERY alpha-male. He is twenty eight, he is a billionaire, self assured, strong, gorgeous, likes to be in control, and emotionally stunted.<br /><br />We learn all the details about what happened to Eva when she was younger, but we only learn the barest of details about Gideon's past, and a lot of questions about what happened to him were unanswered. I know it's to get us to buy the sequel, but honestly, I expected to learn more in this book, and it left me very unsatisfied.<br /><br />Now, here's some more things that just bugged me in this one. In the beginning, neither person wants a relationship. In fact, one of the first things Gideon says to Eva is basically \\"wanna screw?\\". And while Eva seems to be ok with fairly casual sex, she is NOT ok just being a toy, she needs to at least know and like the guy she sleeps with. She stuck to her guns for a while, and I respected that, but Gideon wore her down.<br /><br />And then, after one really hot encounter, suddenly they both want more, and they fall into a relationship pretty quickly, with lots of push and pull, stops and starts, misunderstandings and running away.<br /><br />Gideon's change seemed the most out of the blue. Apparently, sex with Eva was so good, it turned him instantly from a one time only, non-relationship guy crazy about Eva, and I do mean CRAZY. Calls, investigations, expensive gifts. Not stalker crazy, but close. And we never really got a reason why besides a hot encounter in the back of a limo.<br /><br />Then there is the push pull. Eva runs. A LOT. She lives by the rule that it's going to fall apart anyway, might as well not stick around for it to hurt. So Gideon chases. And Eva caves pretty much- instantly. Almost every conflict is over just minutes after Gideon finds her and opens his mouth, which makes me wonder why she runs in the first place.<br /><br />The other thing that really bothered me was best friend Cary. We didn't get a lot of background on Cary either. We know they met in group therapy, they really love each other, he's a recovering addict with a cutter past, he's bisexual and has a hard time being faithful. But he seemed to genuinely love and care about Eva, which made his abrupt attitude change near the end of the story seem REALLY out of left field, and it threw me.<br /><br />And then the story just. Ends. We get no real wrap up, it's just done. I know there's a sequel coming, and it didn't really end on a cliffhanger, but it didn't feel like anything was wrapped up, either. I clicked next on my Kindle, expecting at least an epilogue, but it was just over.<br /><br />Thinking back on this story (I read if a couple of months ago) it really did stick with me, so I think I enjoyed it more than I initially thought I did, and I am pretty anxious for the second book.pparently, sex with Eva was so good, it turned him instantly from a one time only, non-relationship guy crazy about Eva, and I do mean CRAZY.

B0086700CM|5.0|so one time my friend came over with their IPhone and I started playing Temple Run and I thought it was really fun&hellip;so then about a mounth ago I got my Kindle fire. I went on the app store and TR wasn't on it...so I waited and waited and now its here and I play all the time. :) I LOVE IT!
B006RED4GA|4.0|I gave it four stars.  This film is not unpredictable by any stretch of the imagination, but, its quirky characters are fun.  I thought the pacing was great actually.  The script wasn't real deep but it had its nuances and subtexts.  It reminded me of Steven King's style of storytelling, but frankly even as a low budget film it was far better produced than most adaptations of his short stories or books.  The actors, who are all as far as I know complete unknowns, handled their parts effectively; the cinematography was effective; the editing was effective.  If I'd liked the ending better, I would have given it five stars and a round of applause.  As it is, four stars and a tip of the hat - job well done, and better than I expected.
B00563M11M|5.0|Well thought out and enjoyable to read. It's like rediscovering Terry Pratchett for the first time and it makes a welcome addition to the Disc world family.
B000RPCK1U|5.0|Until the Blu-Ray set of all James Bonds comes out, this edition is the best. Frame by frame restoration, great sound, it looks way better than an average dvd.
B0086700CM|3.0|This used to be the best game ever. But  after about a day or two it lags and it loses sensitivity. They really need to make it were it doesnt lag!
0143119680|5.0|I enjoyed this so much. Love books that give my imagination a good twist. I kept thinking of people si know who could fit into her categories.  It was a fun read and did a good job of transporting me from my world to the one in the book. To me, that's the whole reason to pick up a book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The entire Hunger Games trilogy is definately worth the read no matter the age of the reader.  It will pull you in and hold you for the entire ride and I've found myself reading it again a second time not 2 weeks after reading it the first time.  Highly recommended!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is like possibly my favorite game ever. I love this game on my friends iphone and I have been waiting for this game to come out on the kindle fire. its even funner on the kindle fire!  a great buy.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great to pass the time and to pass and challenge your friends. my only downfall would be how much the power-ups cost but then again I'm still new at it and still dying quite early.
0439023513|3.0|I thought the book was well written. The author is a good writer, but the book had an unexpected ending. When comparing Mockingjay to The Hungergames the book is a disaster. I don't know how 40 percent of people have given it a five star rating. Don't expect much from the book, but it does have a good life lesson in the end. If you have read the first two book you should read this book.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I have only listened to the samples and for some that may not be a good base to write a review, and I usually would not write one on that little bit on information but....when I listened to some of the songs I immediately wanted to hear more, not just for the range of his vocals and the lyrics but because some of the melodies took me back to the 80's respectively. Somewhere in there I thought I caught a glimpse of Duran Duran and other Euro-pop songs of a time long ago, but still a good time.So i can say that there was maybe only one song that I did noty like that much but for all the others I can not wait to hear more. When he did \\"Mad World\\" on American Idol I thought he was very good but I did not like some of the songs that followed later on his debut album. This one makes up for all the ones I did not care for.And should he truly play Freddie Mercury, he has won me over totally. I hope he keeps continue to make music that seems to appeal to a younger and older crowd.
0375851569|5.0|For success in school, there's just nothing more important than reading to your child every day. This is just a great collection for both sharing and for the early readers.  Dr. Seuss's quirky drawings, zany characters, and magical wordplay makes daily reading fun and easy for children and adults.<br />The slip-covered, set of six hardcover books contains the books kids will want to hear and read again and again; a really a great shower, or grandparent gift for new parents.
B0086700CM|5.0|when I first got this app I didn't know if it was going to be as good as everyone says. turns out I was wrong. IT WAS WAY BETTER THAN EVERYONE SAID!!!!!!!! buy this app!!!!!!!!! any age will love it!!! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|It is a really good app that keeps you on edge because stuff is chasing you. I think that anyone who complains about this app is dumb because its free,what do people expect?
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best game ever thank God that it came out for kindle fire and its not all that laggy. awesome game
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome game except I always run out of money, which is not fair.I still love this game it is super addictive.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Basic plot; Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) a uniquely talented asynchronous investigative journalist/computer hacker aids Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) with an undercover search that will take the viewer on a very wild ride.  This plot does not pull many punches, very intense; well written and detailed; the location was awesome. There are many twists in this plot.  Hats off to Stellan Skarsgard who plays Martin Vanger, CEO of the Vanger Corporation.  I would give this movie a 9 on a 10 scale
B0086700CM|4.0|Great game, but it could run a bit smoother. Its hard to time the turns when it lags. challenging and fun, but everyone can agree that the game lags a bit.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|The movie Contraband was very good and well written; many twists in the plot.  Mark Wahlberg was excellent as usual and Kate Beckinsale is hot.  Basic plot: Chris Farraday's (Wahlberg) wife and brother-in-law are threatened by a crime organization; Farraday goes into action in a very unique way to eliminate the problem at the source. I'd give this movie an 8 on a 10 scale.
B0086700CM|5.0|such a fun game when ur bored and have nothing to do! I just love playing it!!!!!(: a.k.a. my addiction!&lt;3
B006OCM0G0|5.0|:)  I think for a free game its really fun.  you need to add lots of friends to level up quickly; but they are easy to find.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the bets game ever... so play it like a boss.&#9733; you will love it just like me&hearts;
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|I bought this card reader in order to download photos from a Canon T3i which I just purchased.  For years with my older camera I'd been using a usb cable for downloading,  and this is so much better and faster.  Pop the card out of the camera and insert into the reader,  (which I often just leave in the slot in my computer) and the photos download at lightning speed, even though they are larger files from the new camera.  It works quickly, smoothly and conveniently.  I couldn't be happier.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Well written and in depth development of the main Character, brilliantly written passages of action and more intrigue than I was expecting. A rewarding read that leaves you wanting much, much more.<br /><br />Hanging out for the next book in the series! Well done Anthony Ryan!
B005EGXTL2|4.0|In Mockingjay the third and final novel in the Hunger Games trilogy Katniss finds herself in the fabled District 13. Katniss must become the Mockingjay, a propaganda tool for the government of District 13. Her reservations at once more becoming camera fodder are soon quelled by the need to take down Snow's evil reign in the Capitol.<br /><br />A bit of an overlong novel I found. I'm beginning to suspect that Collins is more of an organic writer than a planner. As with the second novel in this trilogy it felt like it didn't quite know what to do with itself towards the end. It was at times a very dark novel and whilst that might gain it some critique I felt that it was appropriate to the setting and only too relevant. So well done Collins for not giving us kittens and rainbows.<br /><br />To concentrate on the positives Collins knows how to write a gripping narrative and there was never any question that I would finish this novel. There is no shortage of action either and it fulfils the needs of a varied range of readers. I look forward to more from Collins.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|if i could give this game 0 stars i would its soo boring! Its nothing comepared to temple run and temple run is free.<br />this game is not even worth one penny get temple run insted
B0086700CM|5.0|I really injoy this wonderful game. I would play it all day if I could. Its Avery addictive in a good way.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The keyboard doesn't seem to work from my Kindle Fire. What I type is not transmitted to the remote computer. It's unusable in this state. Q&amp;A section of their site show long list of customers with same problem and no resolution so far.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is one of the most addicting games I have ever played in my life!! Step aside Angry Birds!
1469984202|5.0|One of the best series I have read in a long, long time. I devoured the entire series. Fantastic premise, wonderfully executed. Everyone should read this book!
B00785P2QC|5.0|i love this game its very addictive it does freeze on my tablet but its great otherwise g5 keep up the good work
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I live on this app. I put all my writing on this, and I have never had a problem. Perfect for the kindle fire.
0307949508|5.0|I must admit, I was uneasy about ordering online. Amazon was secure, and easy to order from. Delivery was fast. The book was as awesome as I had heard it was. So I give it & Amazon A+++
B0086700CM|5.0|DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! it is totally addicting. my eyes haven't left the screen since I got this game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app.  The ad pop ups bothered me at first but I hardly notice them now.  Lots of fun and I don't have to shuffle.
B000IZ6URY|5.0|Much like South Park this is packed full of satire. From politics to film-making, jokes are made about everything. So as an avid South Park fan and a general fan of Parker and Stone's works, this is enjoyable. On the political side, this movie pokes fun at both sides of the aisle and can be appreciated by liberals and conservatives alike. This was created during the infancy of the \\"War on Terror\\" and pokes a lot of fun of the events happening at that time, as well as Cold War 1980's Pro-American Hollywood films, and 80's style film making in general. The soundtrack is also hilarious. Written and often sung by Parker himself, it's riddled with humor. If you are looking for something with a deep story line, or you don't understand subtle (and often not so subtle) satire, or you are easily offended by bathroom humor, keep looking. But if you are open minded and enjoy intelligent political and social humor mixed with some childish jokes check out this movie.
B002QP145C|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It portrays all the hardships of war. It also shows how men form bonds under such  difficult circumstances. One will be impressed with the fighting spirit which the Finnish soldiers display in the face of great odds.
0375842209|1.0|This was one of the worst books i've read i'm only about 40 pages in and i can't read no more but the worst thing is i have to read all of it for school.<br />This book is very boring and the writing is bad.
B0086700CM|4.0|not the most complicated game but its FREE... and just challenging enough to make me swear out loud every so often.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is awesome!!!!!! I totally recommend this app!! When I searched it, it didn't show up so now I'm so exited that its in the app store now!! YAY!!!!!!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is a book that called to me. It is written simply and I found myself caught up in the story from the very beginning.<br /><br />The story of Adam Brown is both uplifting and humbling. After twenty years in the USAF I retired. Throughout my career I never really compared my experiences to those of people like Adam. I took for granted the sacrifices of those who actively fight to preserve our nation and our way of life. I was a member of our military and I contributed to our overall military mission; however, I was never in harm's way--not even for one day; Adam and thousands of others like him did that job for me and our country. I am truly humbled. And thankful. Thank you Adam, other fighting military forces, Kelley, and all of those who live the tough lives you live so that I and others can go about our daily lives peacefully.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is extremely fun. With this game you have to let your opponet guess what your drawing is, and if they guess right you both get coins to use more colors. I love it! And the game never ends because you can play with anybody!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Like other people have said its a nice way to pass time. I hope others will enjoy also and for new users also.
B0086700CM|5.0|The reason why this game is so fun, is because you always die easily, and when you die easily it makes you want to play MORE. You start to get competitive with the game which makes it even MORE fun!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book maybe erotica for most or border \\"too kinky\\" for others. However, if you are truly able to get past that and just read the series start to finish I do believe you won't be left down but instead filled w/ a renewed sense of energy & \\"sure I think I could try that ;)\\"<br /> Go gettem gals enjoy the trilogy! Put a little spice back into your relationship behind closed doors :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I got this game for my 5 yr old cousin but it was boring for him.  I was bored, and played it one night... 4 days later, I'm addicted.  I just hope I dont get pulled into buying more acorns or coins to complete tasks!
B0057A6GA6|1.0|okay, who the heck fell asleep creating the final map?! &quot;The secret lab:time portal&quot; You gave no guns whatsoever, and very little money for weapons. I am great at TD games and this one map is stupid and cannot be beat. I challenge anyone to do it...including the developers.
0525478817|5.0|Although the book is based on the sadness of teenagers with cancer I felt the book was entertaining<br />and well written.  I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to sit back, relax and enjoy<br />a snuggle with a good book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I play this game with my kids we enjoy building the village and re-arranging the items we purchase.  My kids like playing the games with in the game.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|A fascinating series with some limited and understandable dramatic license.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a more slender and strikingly better looking person than Henry VIII's portraits suggest.  However, he portrays the part reasonably well.  I do feel the computer generated scenes are substandard looking rather contrived.<br /><br />The series is intense.  I have found viewing one episode in the evening quite enough but very enjoyable and entertaining.  I am looking forward to more evenings with Henry and the Tudors.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|i got the app....luved it..now it wont open!!!! if u getvthis app be prepared for this to happen!!!!!! good thing it was free'!!!

B0086700CM|3.0|temple run was really great at first, it worked perfectly. but after like two weeks of having the game, its very glitchy and it lags a lot.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the book and how the story focus on one character and how she is telling her life the way she see it.. and I hope she finish the books with Christian's side of the story...
B0086700CM|5.0|i have been waiting soo long for this app on the kindle fire!! it works great- only a little glitchy!
B003A03RRU|5.0|Well, I am a child and reading on this book is great. The format is okay but just a few typo problems. Overall, it's a good book.
B007GFDVEE|4.0|My 5-1/2 year old son loves the new lego super hero series.  Highly Recommend for all lego and super hero fans!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a nice app.  Easy to use, with clear images.  The main screen displays current information, such as temperature,  cloud cover, humidity and \\"real feel\\" (what the temperature actually feels like).  The information is updated regularly and seems accurate for my area.  Forecast and satellite information is easy to access via a tool bar on the bottom of the screen.  Works perfectly on my kindle.
0385534639|5.0|The Night Circus, like many very popular books, seems to divide opinion. Lots of \\"best of the year\\" lists and five-star reviews, but quiet a few 1- and 2-star reviews as well. There's a lot of magic here, both in the literal sense and metaphorically in term of atmosphere and wonder. Circus imagery abounds, which is not a surprise given the title, and the \\"black and white with a dash of red\\" color scheme of the cover seems to be the color of just about everyone and everything in the story. Descriptions are rich with detail, and it would be fair to say Erin Morgenstern devotes at least as much attention to describing the accoutrements of the circus as developing her major characters.<br /><br />Le Cirque des Rêves, a seemingly mystical traveling circus which appears without warning, vanishes just as suddenly, and is only open to patrons at night. A pair of young magicians, Celia and Marco, are brought up in lifelong magical training, each by an adoptive father figure, in preparation for between these two older men which will be played out by Celia and Marco, at some time in the future.<br /><br />If the book has one failing, it's a greater focus on the performances and mechanisms of the circus and the magical contest than on the internal workings of the characters. The story is not perfect, but the writing is so lushly descriptive and image-rich, the setting so attractive, I found myself in love with it all anyway. I believe this is one of those books prospective readers can easily judge by the cover and synopsis. If it doesn't seem like your kind of thing, it almost certainly isn't. Those readers to whom the central conceit seems interesting will likely be enchanted and forgive the book its few shortcomings. Many, like me, will adore this book and find themselves eagerly awaiting a followup from this first-time novelist.
B0086700CM|5.0|best app in history of apps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love temple run..... it is such an adicting game.....I can never stop playing
B0055SWM08|1.0|this game stinks it is boring. worst worst worst worst worst worst worst worst worst worst worst worst game evwler donot buy.

B007MNV5WU|3.0|I do not think this app is all that great. It does not have as many levels as regular Angry Birds. The levels are short and is able to be beaten in less then 30 minutes. The birds powers are different from Angry Birds; which is cool. It is not worth the money to me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great Series of books!!! I couldnt put them down! I felt the story line could have been a bit better. But overall loved it!
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I think that we as consumers are entitled to answers from the debs about y we are not able to update the game. I am tired of always being last. Can we PLEASE get the update?? I am about to get rid of my kindle because this is not the first time I have had this happen
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game more than any thing in the world except my family it is really fun and challenging to play but i love it too
0345803485|5.0|I really love this book. I loved it so much I bought Two and Three. I just couldnt put them down. I have never been that way with a book before. But, I could put my self in the book and I could see it come alive right in front of me. Now thats what kinds of books I like. I have told all my friends they need to read them. Thanks for the awesome books.:)
B0029LHX1W|5.0|This is an incredible debut novel. I really can't say enough about it. The plot is strong and fast paced. The character development is awesome and you don't have to wait long to be drawn into the book as it builds quickly. Once you are pulled in, it's hard to down, it's a page turner. I also love that it's fact based, as I find it intriguing to read about historical evens in an entertaining manner, but it also lends a sense of reality to everything. A real strength of this story is that there are multiple layers to hold your interest, each one intriguing and intense. One thread is based on the story of Russia's first serial killer and a bureaucratic system that is in denial, refusing to acknowledge or investigate, murders simply cannot exist, thus providing the perfect environment for more murders. I found myself in disbelief that this type of thinking could exist in a Nation. Woven in is also a fascinating account of what life held for the Soviet people under Stalin's regime. A life of constantly watching your back, trusting no one and living in fear, a witness to the worst humanity has to offer. To question the state was tantamount to a death sentence with a torture prelude. Trust no one, not your neighbor, your friend, your wife, your parents, no one. Again, where was the rest of the world when this was happening? In short, a great, great read with lots of twists and turns, suspense and intrigue. I did find some of the violence too graphic but don't let that stop you up from reading the book, there is not that much of it. The film rights to Child 44 have been sold to director Ridley Scott.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|really cute and added cool feature to my phone !!<br />and it was easy to get on<br />really great if you like the look of your iphone and just want something to add a cool look to it :)
0375842209|5.0|Although this book is labeled Young Reader, it is packed with enough personality and thought provoking substance to make its appeal much broader. Initially the young adult label put me off, but it was recommended with such enthusiasm I bought it anyway. I have since learned that is has been marketed as a young adult book in some countries and as an adult novel in others.It is helpful to know beforehand that the narrator is Death; otherwise you may find the start of the book a little confusing. Looking at events from Death's perspective gives the book an interesting twist and a unique perspective. You feel his compassion and confusion as he is witness to the brutalities of the human race. You sense his understanding of human weakness and frailty.The book is set in Nazi Germany providing a background for a variety of characters. You meet the hard lined obsessed Nazis and the German citizen willing to risk everything to hide the Jews from them. You quickly become emotionally involved with the title character Liesel and her best friend Rudy as you watch the war come closer and intrude more and more on their day to day lives. The story and the characters are believable. The book is intense, memorable and beautifully written in a clean style. I highly recommend it.

0061537969|5.0|I loved this feel good original book. Garth Stein not only entertained me, but gave me a new found appreciation for my dog. Non animal lovers don't be put off, it's not an animal story. It's about life, love and relationships. The central character for this story is a lovable, devoted dog named Enzo (who is also the narrator). Told from his point of view brings a very interesting perspective about human behavior to this heart felt and genuine story about life and its struggles. Rarely does a book bring me to tears or make me laugh out loud, and this book achieved both. Although I would categorize this as a light read it has a lot of substance and several messages through out which make you ponder some life questions. The characters are believable and somewhat flawed for a realistic view on life. Not only do you fall in love with Enzo but you will be rooting for his owner Denny (somewhat of an underdog,sorry couldn't resist).
B000002L42|5.0|I friend of mine bought this cd for me 15 years ago. I missed placed it and I missed it so much that I had to purchase it again. Classic cd that always delivers.
0553386794|5.0|Admittedly, I've already watched the TV show on HBO or the same name, so going into this book I was already familiar with the characters and plot line. I have to say, HBO did a pretty good job of sticking to what George R.R. Martin has written.<br /><br />I loved the book. It seemed pretty well thought out. The plot, despite its many characters, was easy to follow but still complex and unpredictable enough to keep me very engaged. The writer's style was readable without being too simplified (i.e. sentences were longer than 6 or 7 words and had words with more than two syllables).<br /><br />Each of these characters, good and evil, had something about them to which I could relate. I enjoyed all of them, even the children. And I enjoyed loathing Sansa, too. Personal taste there - those kinds of girls make me gag.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book and intend to continue with the series.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|its great and I haven't had a single problem me my family and friends all enjoy this and it works perfectly on my kindle.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun and cool concept. Nothing advanced but it is worth it. Brings out little kid in me. Spent 30 minutes on it and it felt like 5.
B000JLTRIQ|4.0|very well done.  A sensitive portrayal of a day in the life of some families immediately involved.  Sensitive, thoughtful, touching portrayal.  Portrayed realistically.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a very good game whenever you have free time u can alwaysplay it sometimes it gets fustarating when u keep dying the cool thing about it is it never ends and u can get differ people to run get this game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book and story line captures your interest and holds it for the entire book. I think it is so appealing because it is not out of the realm of possiblity that a similar situation could happen. At any rate it is a good fantasy!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think the psychological warfare was very well portrayed. This was a dark book but how does you life not become dark when everything you love is taken from you. You would also lose the fight in you if you have nothing left to fight for. I thinkthe story line was very well written
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Works great for protecting my Fire and looks very classy.  Check out the video they have out there.  I got the charcoal color.

B004TTZHBK|4.0|The videos are nice, but it could really do more as an interactive cookbook. It is very simple and easy to follow.  I was hoping for more on the video instruction. It would be nice if it was able to play youtube videos on how to make various dishes.  However, I am still looking for a cookbook app where I can enter in what I have and it gives me options of what I can make. Overall a nice app that comes in handy from time to time.
B000660UN0|5.0|Though I have the \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\" CD, I had never seen or heard about \\"Sessions\\" before. I happened to catch the last song while channel surfing -- Eric Clapton playing \\"Love In Vain Blues\\" solo on an acoustic guitar -- and was intrigued enough to buy the DVD/CD set. I was not disappointed! The musicianship and performances are excellent. Doyle Bramhall II often outshines Clapton on guitar. I have been playing the DVD and CD constantly since buying the set, and I'd bet you would do the same if you buy this.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|This is exactly the app I have been looking for. I can backup to my cloud account. I can have my accounts and passwords on accessible on multiple devices and its encrypted. You want this app, especially with all the different account names and passwords you need to remember.
0345803485|5.0|I bought this book for my wife. She read the first one in about three days. I highly recommend you buy all 3 books for your wife or girlfriend. You can thank me later. She loved all three of them by the way.
B003ELKNH2|3.0|The Redux of Apocalypse Now has added minutes to the film and in my mind they could have left them on the editing room floor. Sure extra minutes but you see why these parts have been left out of the original. All the added scenes do is make a long movie even longer. Also the sound softens and goes back to where you had it many times in the film making the words sometimes hard to understand. Again the scenes added are not worth much as they come with bad acting, silly skits and really just added crapola... It becomes a different movie with the cheesy parts added back in...
0385344228|4.0|I knew there would be a twist to the ending -but never expected how it actually would  end. A page turner (er page toucher with my Kindle --love it)  A mother knows things.....
B0086700CM|5.0|for it to come out on android and I'm super pumped that it finally is. getting addicted all over again
B0086700CM|5.0|loving this game! great way to pass some time .  plays flawlessly on my kindle fire.  :) I love it even more because its free!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|coolest game around would recommended it to everyone that likes a nice fun game needs more costumes for the character though
B002KS1IJC|2.0|I saw how many 4 and 5 star reviews this got and I decided to give it a chance. I was not impressed. It was an okay movie if you have nothing else to do and I mean literally nothing else to do. Nothing new here, in fact it really reminded me of Alien 3. I did a little research and found out that the story for this movie was written in 1992 the same year Alien 3 was released in theaters, then it all made sense to me.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|the filming was done well...but it was a total waste of time. The movie was almost as bad as castaway.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|plays like a defense tower game bug while u summon ur samurai ur also in the battle controlling ur character and fighting as well. lots to upgrade, unlock and level up. deff recommend for anyone looking to have a fun free game.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I found Fifty Shades Of Grey: Book One an enjoyable read!  Tough to put down. Hot, steamy, lust that kept me wondering what would happen next.  The characterization was interesting and kept me wanting to know more about what caused Grey to be incapable of true love.
0765316994|4.0|A meta-fiction about life aboard a starship that is really a starship on a TV show where, when the extras get killed off, people on board the starship really die. One day, they decide to do something about it. If you can get with this premise, you'll probably love this book. It's extremely well done and I'd bet the author had a ball writing it. If you're looking for another Old Man's War, tho, you won't find it here.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun I play it about everyday. the creatoir of this game is a genius! I hope he or she makes more games like this!!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I picked up Ready Player One after having someone recommend it to me. As a kid who grew up in the 80's, I immediately identified with the themes of the book and the 1980's pop culture references were like a trip back to my childhood.<br /><br />The story is about a dystopian future, thirty years from now, when the Great Recession never got any better and most people live in poverty. In 2012, an inventor named Roy Halliday created a new type of immersive MMO game called OASIS, which changed everything. People started doing everything in the game- working, living, going to school, raising their children- all done through a wraparound visor and haptic gloves. Within a few years, nearly everyone in the real world was doing most everything through OASIS, and the man who invented it all was a multi-billionaire, and one of the most powerful men on the planet.<br /><br />Fast forward thirty years and Halliday has died without any heirs. Just before he died, though, he hid an Easter Egg somewhere in the massive world and encouraged the users to find it, promising control of OASIS and all of his money to the individual who found his hidden Easter Egg. With billions on the line, nearly everyone in the world engaged in the hunt, made even more fun by the fact that Halliday was a teenager in the 80's and left references to his favorite 1980's video games (Joust, Pacman, Galaga), music (Rush, ACDC) movies (Blade Runner, Terminator, WarGames) and tv shows (Family Ties). However, the challenge proved to be too great, and five years after Halliday's death, no one has made any progress in solving his riddles. Until one day, a high school student named Wade Watts stumbles upon the first key, reigniting the fervor for the game and setting Wade in a race against everyone else in the world who wants to beat him to the final prize.<br /><br />This book was ridiculously good. I started reading it Saturday morning and could not put it down. I read late Saturday night and got up early Sunday and kept reading and finished the 400 page book Sunday afternoon. It is a relatively easy read- the storyline is not complicated and it moves along at a very quick pace. The characters are well developed and engaging and of course, there is a great villain to root against. Lots of 1980's pop culture references made me smile as I remembered my own childhood. If you are at all a nerd or enjoy dystopian science fiction, do yourself a favor and pick this book up.and kept reading and finished the 400 page book Sunday afternoon.

B0077SGMXM|5.0|Awesome game. A lot of fun. Plenty of levels, and different difficulty levels too. Can definitely spend hours playing this game. Well worth the money.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I'VE BEEN A FAN OF DAVID BALDACCI'S WORK FOR YEARS, AND THIS DOES NOT DISAPPOINT.  THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH HIS BOOKS IS HAVING NONE LEFT TO READ.  EAGERLY AWAITING HIS NEXT ONE.  5 STARS FOR THIS NOVEL!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am super happy this awesome app is in the store!<br />I check every morning to see if it is finally on and it finally is!<br />don't listen to those dumb reviews.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I was so happy when the put this out on DVD. It is a great show if you like stories of teenagers who are just regular kids dealing with issues that some teens felt in that decade and today. It is not the perfect girls and guys looking all Hollywood and talking all OMG and stuff. It is real and makes you feel hey I can relate.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love having access to the Bible anytime I need to pull it out. Wish it had a directory for finding verses for different situations.
B0086700CM|5.0|THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!! When I first got my kindle fire, I immediately went to the app store to try to find temple run. it wasn't there. I was disappointed and whenever I could, check if it was there. once I saw, I feaked out! I down loaded as soon I could.  It is a super fun game and is very addicting. I am glad I have it!
0345803507|5.0|the best book series i have read in a long time. Once yu start it you will not be able to put it down.

B0086700CM|5.0|I got a different temple run and it was a fake.Finaly they have templerun for the kindle and its free.
B00834R580|1.0|This particular episode fell far below the standard established by the previous episodes.  I don't want to give anything away, but this was EXCEPTIONALLY contrived, implausible, and disappointing.  Plus, how many times are we going to see him deduce, from fur on pants, that someone owns a dog?<br /><br />All the prior episodes were so good that I'll spring for the next one after this, but as for you, save your money.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great. it is amazing. it is so addicting and fun and one of the best games I have ever played. I would highly recommend getting this game.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I love this book! I read some of the reviews of how people didn't care for the violence and codependent relationship but people need to put it in perspective. Late teen years and early twenties everything is amplified, dramatic & chaotic, at least it was for me. Sometimes I miss those high drama years and this took me back and it was so fun with the ups and downs and the building of an amazing relationship.<br />The minute I finished it I went right back to chapter 1 and started it over again.
B002YCVX5S|2.0|The movie is a pointless, and often boring, fantasy.  Much of the the acting is sub-par, except for the guy playing the brilliant/repulsive/charming SS officer. I realize many Tarantino fans found it \\"brilliant\\",  but that assemsment escapes me.  Now I DO like Tarantino's work, but when this one was over all I could think of is \\"THAT was it?\\".<br /><br />I guess I'm too dumb to \\"get it\\". But then again, I don't feel obliged to be that smart.
0345803485|5.0|I loved these books!  I had to try to read a chapter or two a day so I wouldn't just blow thru them all in a day or two, which is what I wanted to do.  Wonderful storytelling.  Most importantly, she has understood how to write about the spark, between a man and a woman, that few before her have captured.  It's not all about the BDSM for everyone, it's about the push and pull between the characters, and she's got it down to an exact science.  I would love to see a book written in Christian's perspective of the whole thing, or a continuation, such a beautiful story, I feel like it could go on for so much longer.  I hope EL James writes more books, because, all the women in America and the UK are following her actions by now.  It's safe to say, she's changed the way we like to read our books, and what we like to read about.  Way to change it up EL James.  The publicity must be a shock, but you deserve every bit, you are talented at what you do, we are all waiting for what next you will do.<br /><br />:)
B0086700CM|4.0|its not what everyone said it would be it is very fun but frustrating IDK : D and a little addicting!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I love it!  Classic, clean look, with all the options you need and nothing you don't.  Definitely worth the $0.99 to remove the ads. I also recommend Solitaire+ and Spider Solitaire+ from Branium.
B0034G4P94|5.0|From the Director of Miracle, from every angle to every intended emotional eye tearing moment put this one of kinda (MMA Movie) on a pedestal being an embodiments of potential sport-like oscar contenders out there.  Sport movies are like comedies they aren't filmed with a WOW that comes from audiences of all delights (\\"never Grammy material\\") however, Miracle was a Walt Disney and this is still just seen as a sports movie but it is more than that.  Friday Night Lights was excellent but it wasn't an oscar like film.  The way it was directed puts everyday movie fanatics raving about the Wow reaction but not critics.  Go through and read the Professional critics movie reviews, tv stations studios and big time NY sources put this Movie aside from the Sports wow and mix it with instant Classics like Avatar, Goodfellas, and the Lord of the Rings (1,2) - big time arguable classics, all movies that got cut short of a historical big time Oscar.  Well written, realistic and real time fighting.  But thist may be it that UFC doesn't possess the well rounded aspects of live that can be captured through film.. well fine, just save this for the Fight Fans then.  Nick Nolte was great - nominated for best supporting actor (AGAIN).  Great life lessons, and a solid story line, wraps all critical pieces together at the end, keeping it realistic, makes ya wana throw a fist or two to act out cause you just cant handle sitting down watching the excitement, so you no wat man, No oscar nominations, Fine keep it for the fight fans... Me and millions alike.  This is a Must-See, the beginning of further highlighting a sport that keeps getting more and more popular in America... UFC MMA.
B006C1DH92|4.0|I bought this instead of the original Fruit Ninja because the graphics seem brighter and it comes with a cool \\"Point Blank\\" style arcade game mode. Addictive, fast-paced fun. Works great on my Kindle Fire. I love that there are no ads but I wish there weren't links to the movie site on the menu page.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Very fun game. Definitely a good game for people who like number puzzles. Would definitely recommend to others to try soon.
145210655X|5.0|I got this for my sister as a mother's day gift and she absolutely loves it!  If you know a Star Wars fan with a kid, this is the perfect father's day or mother's day item!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was blown away by this book. A friend recommended it to me and once i got my hand on the book, i could not put it down. Ive read a few romance book but it was always too slow or just too boring so i just stop<br /><br />So when i read this book not knowing alot about it besides what is written behind the book. I was quite shock and i thought to myself ohh wow this is kinda wild and i was kinda shy and embarass if anyone knew i was reading this kind of book. So i kept reading it and i see there's more to it, the love story between Christian and Anna. I fell in love with the love story! I love how much Christian loves Anna.<br /><br />Now that Ive finished all three of fifty shades i dont think i will find a book that will top this. Ive read a few books but nothing comparable to fifty. I keep going back to Christian. Christian makes my heart melt!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|great googly moogly! I absolutely love this app!!!!!!! I cant believe its free because this game is great! absolutely amazing!
B0086700CM|5.0|I think it is such a fun game and like I play it all the time and if anyone wants to tell me something put it in the description box for this app temple run tuns
B004LWZW4C|1.0|I loved this movie.  Loved, loved, loved this movie.  Saw it three times in theaters, downloaded crappy bootlegs before I could buy it, eagerly pre-ordered the Blu-Ray with Digital Copy.  When I finally received it the Blu-Ray wouldn't work in our LG Blu-Ray player.  I tried it in a nice Samsung player, again, no go.  I shipped it back to Amazon for a replacement -- at no extra cost to me, at least -- which arrived quickly.  Life happened and I didn't try the movie again until today.  Unfortunately, the new Blu-Ray also refuses to play in the Samsung, which is just great.  Of course, now I've found all the old reviews with other people whose Blu-Rays haven't worked, which is really disappointing and extraordinarily shoddy on Fox's part.  This was a movie I truly enjoyed, and it's incredibly frustrating that I can't have that same experience I so enjoyed in theaters.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I have to say that this show is so refreshing, innovative and entertaining. I have not liked a show as much as this one in years. Please do not discontinue this show like you do most others, keep it going. I will definitely buy this on DVD. If you have not started watching it, you have to give it a try.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|One of the greatest sci-fi titles of all time. An epic adventure that should have been told in much greater length.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|worst app ever 7 $ down the drain come on I wish if u delete it u get you'll get your money back full of crap
B00499K9E0|5.0|I'm not a fan of this time classic iconic detective. What I do enjoy is  being entertained. That is what great script writing coupled with great acting is all about.<br /><br />You have plenty of reviews to give you a perspective but if you just love a fast paced mystery for the 21st century then watch this show.<br /><br />Brilliant writing on the part of Mr Steven Moffat. Same guy who did Coupling. I can imagine (vaguely because I don't think I could ever be in a league with his mind), Mr Moffat waking up in the middle of the night asking himself, \\"What would Sherlock Holmes be like in this day and age?\\" That answer: the kind of Sherlock Holmes that is a pompous, quad-core thinking and highly socially inept genius that parallels perfectly with this technologically immersed culture.<br /><br />Here we have a character revamped to contain the same witty elements I'm sure my grand parents enjoyed from reading the books plus things like text message, blogging, and all the other familiar modern luxuries that are now common to us. Neither one over done.<br /><br />The technology never overshadows the vast mind of Mr Holmes. I enjoyed the ride of season one. I hope you do too. Despite how current modern technology can make special effects look cool and transport us to far away places, this show still displays the best kind of technology in the universe: the human mind.<br /><br />I love the BBC for putting out some great media without having to over gore, over dramatize like I see here in the U.S. That formula can get old and insulting to my brain cells. Something old with something way new. I'm telling all my friends to watch it.<br /><br />Grab your loved one or family member. Snuggle up with some popcorn, chips sushi, or edamame etc (because we live in a strange world now, all bets are off) and be entertained. This is some intelligent yet entertaining media.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B0081J9OWC|3.0|This one feels like it was phoned in. Save for Man On Fire, the cd lacks a catchy, melodic tune. Maybe Mr. Ebert wanted to make this more of a band experience - it does have some interesting sounds, but lacks direction.<br />His solo cd ALEXANDER is far superior. Hopefully after repeated listens it will grow on me.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Overall the book was a good read. I'm pretty picky when it comes to books, but this book kept me interested to read more. It was cool to read about the many people she met through hiking and some of their stories as to why they're doing it. It was very inspiring to read of all the challenges she faced, before and during, hiking the PCT and how she had the strength to finish what she started, on her own.
B0086700CM|4.0|It will close with out worning. but other then that its great. I was so happy when it came out for kindle fire
0307949486|5.0|I should have been writing today because I'm behind, but I'm on vacation so I'm trying to do a different kind of work -- posting reviews of books I've read this past year.<br /><br />I watched all of the Swedish movies made from Stieg Larson's Millennium books then went to the books. What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said?<br /><br />I started reading the books with the first book in the series, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Second up was The Girl Who Played With Fire, and last is The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.<br /><br />All I can say is: compelling, tragic, scary, engrossing -- and at times gross -- but these gripping, brutal mysteries are must reads!<br /><br />If you haven't read these books, get them.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|\\"Captain America\\" is about as \\"feel-good\\" of a movie about superheroes or war that I have probably ever seen. Most of this is because our protagonist is such a likable guy. Steve Rogers is such a kind and humble man, in spite of the awesome power he posseses. He also manages to make you proud to be an American, not because he goes around flaunting America's greatness, but because he just lives such an honorable and virtuous life. He experiences very real obstacles, not just Nazis (or rather Hydra), but also a buerocratic command structure, his own early physical limitations, and the loss of friends. As a character, Captain America is sympathetic and relatable, and as a period piece, his film does a wonderful job evoking the time period of WW2. Throw in some fun action some decnt humor, and you've got a film that anyone can and should enjoy.
B005D6O0IO|5.0|These are the greatest shoes ever.  Very comfy, flattering, and my only complaint is they don't come in more colors.  Perfect.
B0034G4P80|4.0|\\"Thor\\" is fairly unique amongst superhero films in that it has multiple characters that are complex in their motivations and experience signifigant character development throughout the course of the film. Most notably this applies to both the hero of the tale, Thor, and the villain, his brother Loki. Both characters start at different places than they finish, and undergo believable character arcs, and Loki's motivations are far more intricate and involved than your typical villain fare, making him far more compelling than your typical world-conquerer or power-grabber. As for the look of Asgard and its inhabitants? A regal fantasy world that remains embedded in your memories. Oh, and of course there's the action in the bits where Thor actually has his hammer (which isn't for most of the movie, surprisingly...). Still, Thor is a fun movie with characters that provide an interesting drama about familial relationships. It might be a little too bizarre for some tastes, but if you enjoy fantasy or superheroes this is one to at least give a chance.
B0086700CM|4.0|It s a good app but my problem is you play all day and it still goes on. They're should be a place to stop. I don't want to play all day but it is entertaining A-

1439170916|5.0|A great book - Mukherjee gives a compelling account of the history of cancer and cancer therapy and threads it through with stories of his patients and their struggles against cancer.  The focus of the book is on the history and biology of cancer, starting with the ancients and ending up with the targeted drugs that started appearing in the 1990s and 2000s, based on the work of biologists like Bishop and Varmus.  I'd recommend this book to anyone with an interest in medicine.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best game ever in my life I love it its my fav game ever you most have nothing to do to play this game
B0063GORYU|5.0|Really nice app for Kindle fire.  I Love the option to choose orientation.  Nice graphics and responsive.  I am hooked and play daily. Recommended!
B000SLP4SE|2.0|Unfortunately, for fans of the novel by Stephen Hunter, POINT OF IMPACT, the film casts Marky Mark in the anti-hero leading role.  Fortunately, it has a grade A director, Antoine Fuqua, director of Denzel Washington's Oscar winning turn in Training Day, and the increasingly impressive character actor Michael Peña [Battle Los Angeles, Crash, & Oliver Stone's World Trade Center].<br /><br />Still, the viewer who cares about good acting has to endure Mark Wahlberg trying to act in every scene, and that's just not worth the torture.  Read the novel instead.
B0086700CM|1.0|This is a good app!! but I don't think people review it fairly. They put 5 stars because they are happy it came out. It does have some things they need to fix like turning controls &#9733;
B0086700CM|5.0|when u start the game u will be blown away... u will have  so much fun running away from the evil monkies.
0545265355|5.0|These are some of the best books I've read in a while. You seriously cannot guess what will happen next. There are so many unexpected action packed twists that you'll be entertained the whole time. If you get into books as much as me, you'll laugh, cry, and celebrate with the characters. If you have any interest in these action packed books, then you better just go ahead and buy them! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is awesome it is so fun you just can't just stop playing it!It is so entertaining my sister and I love it
0385344228|5.0|I'm a full time MBA student and rarely allow myself the luxury of a fiction book.  This one was perfect.... it was easily read and understood, all the while layering so many of life's complexities on another.  Highly recommended.
B0015AARJI|1.0|First time I have ever written an Amazon customer review. I feel I need to. I just opened this controller's packaging and it didn't feel right in my hands. I figured that it had just been a long time since I bought a new one (though I go through them pretty fast - I only play the NHL series of games, but I must play pretty ferociously because mangle the controllers). Then certain buttons started showing problems as soon as I began playing - the directional pad doesn't work sometimes, the R1 button gets stuck, the R2 trigger is not responsive AT ALL (I guess the counterfeiters didn't figure out how to make them properly touch-sensitive).<br /><br />This is CLEARLY, a knock-off controller. Like, you have to be an absolute idiot to think that this thing is real. I'm shocked at how many 5-star reviews this thing has... I mean, you can play with it, but it is obviously, obviously fake. People are unbelievably stupid. I looked at this page and thought I was crazy seeing all the five-star reviews that appeared. Thankfully I'm not, as you can see from the fact that there are over 100 reviews noting that it is a counterfeit. You would think at least one of those would appear on the main page, no? You would think the algorithm that determines what appears would hone in on words like \\"fake\\" and \\"counterfeit,\\" no? Really disappointed in Amazon for wasting my time with this.<br /><br />EDIT: Actually, here's the problem: Amazon combines the reviews for EVERY DIFFERENT SELLER OF THESE CONTROLLERS, so the 5-star reviews are all for the real ones sold by Amazon or other legitimate sellers, which allows the counterfeiters and bootleggers to slide through the cracks mostly undetected. How can Amazon let that happen!?!?!<br /><br />And shame on Amazon for not taking greater care when selling goods. They are breaking the law by \\"fulfilling\\" these orders, since these fake controllers are using all of Sony's marks and they have a fake sticker on the back of them and everything. Also, shame on Amazon for basically hiding the fact that this was sold by whatever fake company sells these and only \\"fulfilled by Amazon\\" - if that was more apparent on the page, I NEVER would have wasted my time ordering this.<br /><br />Way to go being complicit in criminal activity, Amazon!

If you go that route (and I bought an extender for $50) why not just run a wire to the ethernet port on your receiver?  Also, your $25 basically buys you Internet radio.  If your receiver is hooked up to any kind of smart device--blu-ray player, set-top box, tv, anything--you've already got that.<br /><br />As another reviewer noted, your chances of getting the UWF-1 to connect to your network are about 50%.  (BTW, once I bought the extender, the UWF-1 reset and thereafter woudn't recognize any access points.  Fixable?  Probably, but I refuse to throw any more effort after foolishness on this thing.)  There are better and cheaper options out there.
0670023329|5.0|It's hard to call it such a great book when it was such a horrific journey that someone actually experienced. I wish everyone would read this book.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I absolutely love that I can have this workout finished in the same amount of time it would take me to get to my gym's parking lot. Stay-at-home moms and busy working moms, listen up! You can find the time to do this work out.<br /><br />I started Jillian's 30-Day Shred 4 days ago. I really felt sore half-way through the next day, mostly my thighs, but it was a nice soreness. I plan to do each routine for 10 days each.<br />I can tell that I'm adding muscle. I'm panting at the end of each exercise and just push myself to continue because we have just 20 minutes to pack it all in.<br />I love that this work out (including my getting ready) is under 30 minutes. I love that I need a shower afterwards. I love that I can have a sense of accomplishment every day for 30 days.<br /><br />Jillian's style is positive and encouraging.<br /><br />I think the reviews about knee injuries are off the mark and scape goating on Jillian and the exercises. I would have to say that if someone just began exercising after not exercising for an amount of time, they'll notice tightness in their knees and other joints. Please remember for every pound of weight you are overweight, you add an additional 7 pounds of pressure to your knee joint. Ouch. Care for your knees by doing the modified exercises until the muscles are stronger and your flexibility improves.<br /><br />I would recommend to people that they invest in very good aerobic shoes, purchased from a running store. I would also recommend that people take their time properly stretching and being kind to their muscles and joints (maybe warm baths with Epsom salt?). The exercises in the video will not cause knee injuries if done properly. Don't try to do advanced deep squats or lunges if you are not strong enough. Start out in the modified positions and add more range of motion as you become stronger.<br /><br />I want to encourage people to do this work out for 30 days. Think ahead of a time that you are open to do the workout for 20minutes (and I'd recommend having time afterwards for a shower).<br /><br />Why 4 stars? I would like to have a little more stretching at the end to ensure muscles are well-stretched. But I do them on my own (like the one in which you lie on your back, one foot on floor, knee bent, opposite foot on bent knee, and raise leg with bent knee along with opposite foot to stretch hamstrings, hips, etc.).

B004ZNANZA|2.0|---It Irritates me that Amazon does not separate the 'Wall\\" regular release reviews from the 'Experienced'  reviews.<br /><br />The Wall cd is a classic, so I'll skip the story about how wonderful the album is and get to the \\"Experienced\\"  release.<br />First off-  the sound is 'ok'  I really think they slacked on this one as opposed to 'Wish You Were here'  and \\"Dark Side\\"<br />sets.<br />Secondly- the bonus material is very mediocre.<br />Just demos/outtakes not much you'd play over and over.<br />I believe they missed the boat on this one.<br />Why, for whatever reason, can't they include the full version of 'What Shall We Do Now?\\"  the full version, as see in the movie, is essential.<br />It was originally recorded for the album-  \\"Empty Spaces\\"  leads into it, hence the included lyrics in the original album jacket.<br />It would've been nice to have a few of the movie versions of the songs, that would've been a nice extra.<br />Instead we get a disc of demos most probably won't play much.<br />Ages ago it was really cool to get demos/out takes but now I'm getting over it.<br />I'd rather have the unreleased finished songs and really, there's no reason they can't include both.<br />I didn't even bother with the 'Immersion' set on this one as that is a total bomb.<br /><br />If you have money to burn, buy this  if not - you're not missing much.
0060839872|1.0|Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is the rambling thoughts a philosopher who concludes that because he can't define quality, it can't be defined and is the center of all insight about the universe.  (Quality Control professionals would have no problem providing such a definition.)  Philosophers often come up with goofy conclusions about other people disciplines such as the nature of God or the universe and yet so often people look at these musing as profound.  This book is neither profound or entertaining.<br /><br />The author takes what might have been an interesting story about a motorcycle trip or about the importance of understanding and maintaining your own equipment, and ruins it with these musings.
B007WV05GY|4.0|I don't agree with many of the reviewers. I think the movie was filmed not as an action packed film, with Liam Neeson kicking ass left and right. I think the movie was made for the viewer to think: What would have I done in that situation? Regular men, tough men, but still regular guys that are thrown out in the elements and need to survive. Mistakes? they made plenty, but then again they are just like you and me, not like Bear Grylls.

0375842209|5.0|I sometimes read rave reviews here on Amazon and wonder if the person who read the book and wrote the review read the same book that I did.  In this case, the over 1100 people who gave THE BOOK THIEF 5 stars could not have been more correct. This is book is outstanding! It deserves every accolade that it has been given and I would like to thank the person who recommended it to me.<br /><br />The plot is well thought out and the characters touch your heart as you can feel yourself sitting in the damp basement with Liesel and Max.  You can hear Hans playing the accordian and you can taste the meger meals the family eats.  You feel thier pain. If forces you to answer the question - what would I have done?  It is a story that you will live with for many years, if not the rest of your life.<br /><br />Fortunately, I knew little of the plot going into the book. Watching the story unfold adds a great deal to the intrigue and the beauty of the tale. So I would caution prospective readers to avoid reading reviews that reveal too much of the story.<br /><br />This book would be a great parallel read for students reading THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK.  It shows a different perspective of World War II and the conditions under which many average German citizen. It is about the reality of war.<br /><br />In my book, 5 stars are not enough for this wonderful story of life, death, and survival.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|E.L. James' lack of imagination and character development is surpassed only by her painfully limited vocabulary.  To say that she is repetitive and trite is a colossal understatement.  I am convinced that the much publicized erotic passages were included to improve the sales of her lackluster little story.  The very weak ending is also an obvious attempt to sell the sequels.  Though why the reader would have any further interest in the underdeveloped characters is beyond me.  This, by far is one of the worst books I have ever read.  If 0 stars was an option that would have been my rating.

B007MJ9LA2|3.0|I have been a Santana fan for ove 40 years. HIs last few albums have been either bad or just too commercial and missing the true \\"old\\" Santana feeling. This CD I decided to pre-buy and I give it an acceptable rating. He tries to capture some of the old Santana feeling on a couple of songs, but just misses on others. The tracks have similiar riffs as some previous songs done with some changes that just make it acceptable. Not bad, but certainly not great. I am a professional guitarist and play his songs as well. Sure wish he would cut down on the bass on the guitar and get to the similiar sound he recorded with on the classic stuff we all like. OF course he used different equipment then. As a musician, I can learn some things, but simply to play and listen to- well if you are not a Super Santana fan, you will probably be disappointed. Overall, I give a couple of songs 5 stars and the rest, 3 stars. This is looking at the CD once again as a musician. As a non- musician, you will probably be saying- It is o.k. and that is all.
0553801473|1.0|Considering how much I liked the first three books, this was tremendously disappointing.  Not only did many of the ongoing story lines founder in book 5, but the new characters added nothing of interest.  It was a struggle to make it through to the end.<br /><br />I'm still baffled by the number of story lines that seem to have been left hanging in the air:  Brienne of Tarth, Asha Greyjoy, Jamie Lannister, Sansa Stark, Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Sam Tarly, on and on.  And many of the story arcs that did reach a conclusion were abrupt and pointless, as if someone had yelled 'Cut' on a bad Saturday Night Live scene.<br /><br />Awful.  So bad that I wonder how anyone could have honestly written a 5-star review here.  I wish I would have had the good sense to listen to the bad reviews before buying the book...

There are a few missteps in weaponry and equipment that didn't come from this period, but unless you're really into these things, it isn't a problem. This is a must see movie.

0345803485|1.0|*May contain spoilers.*<br /><br />I cannot begin to describe how disappointed and frustrated I am with this trilogy.<br /><br />Prior to reading this book I heard many many criticisms and bad reviews about this book but I thought 'It's been at the top of the New York Times Best Seller list for weeks now, how bad could it possibly be?'. Clearly I could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />As many others have said in their reviews, the constant repetition of words and phrases is unbelievably annoying! Inner Goddess, holy f-bomb, biting my lip and let's not go into the forceful inserts of 'fifty shades...' (I could not stop laughing either because every time she said fifty I thought of fifty cent). As a newly graduated college student myself, I am quite certain no one of my age says things like that in our inner dialogue. The sad thing is that it appears Mrs. E.L. James did have complete access to a thesaurus as we see many uncommonly used words thrown in there simply for the sake of it. Seriously, I felt like I was reading something written by a high school student for her SATs.<br /><br />The characters and just the storyline itself in these books were extremely unbelievable. The plain jane heroine who sparks the interest of a seemingly perfect gentleman because she does not succumb to his charm. Although not very original but is basically the general start of every romance novel so I won't criticize her for that. But throughout all three books there is really no character development. Christian is very confident and charming in the very beginning of the book and then becomes a jealous, controlling man child for the rest of the first book and until almost the end of the third book. Then he is suddenly enlightened and becomes a loving father. Anastasia is insecure but extremely confident when she speaks, becomes a crybaby and then suddenly in the third book is brave and no longer insecure. And then they live happily ever after. This is all within three months?<br /><br />After the first book, I skimmed through the entire other two books because the sex scenes were just annoying. Every scene is exactly the same! I think Mrs. E.L. James just copy and pasted each scene and tweaked it a little. It's as if having as many sex scenes as possible was the sole purpose of the book and the storyline itself was just there so that it could be called a novel.<br /><br />The author tends to portray the characters in a way that seems almost stereotypical. Constantly using profanity, materialistic, and showing no care for others except oneself. I can understand why for she is from the UK but could she not have done more research? As an American I think I'm a little offended.<br /><br />I do want to praise her for having the courage and spending the time to write all three books. Although not a good read, I still wanted to find out what happened and did have a good laugh at the things the characters did and said. I suppose this is the same reason reality television shows make so much money. However, for her future books, I recommend that she either finds a new editor (if she has one) or learn to proofread her own writing. It also wouldn't hurt to bounce some ideas off her colleagues.

B007O3QC8K|5.0|Something that continues to astound me is the falling off of the number of recordings that are coming out of Berlin nowadays.  Long gone are the days of Karajan who was a recording master, and even Abbado managed a respectable number of discs, including some of the best Mahler ever committed to tape.  However, it's 2012 now and we must make do with what we have, which brings us to this particular recording.<br />  Having read a biography of Simon Rattle, I'm surprised to find that he's long been a champion of Bruckner's 9th symphony - this coming from a man who has done magical things with the music of Schoenberg, Bartok, etc.  So why tackle Bruckner, a bastion of the Romantic era? (To the best of my knowledge, there are only two other recordings of Sir Simon and Bruckner - a 7th from Birmingham and a wonderful 4th from Berlin.)  Well, I'll offer up a couple of theories.  Firstly, Bruckner is a composer that Karajan long championed, and his Bruckner recordings with Berlin are astounding, especially the two recordings of the 9th he made.  They are powerful, well controlled readings.  Bruckner can't be accused of being a good structuralist, but Karajan held these baggy monsters together and made them into something really special.  I think Sir Simon wants to show that Berlin is still an excellent Bruckner orchestra.  I'm happy to report that this is very much a fact.  Secondly, Bruckner's harmonies in this symphony are more looking forwards to the Second Viennese School rather than backwards towards say, Wagner.  Who better to bring out these qualities than the conductor who has probably done more for twentieth century music in the last couple of decades than anyone else on the international circuit?  Out of the available recordings of the 9th, this one does that the most.  No fuddy-duddy old cathedral Bruckner here - this is a fresh interpretation.  Rattle has a tendency for fussiness, but I find that to be mostly absent here.  Granted it's not as sweeping as Karajan but it moves with power that is inherent in this music.  The scherzo is punchy in the loud parts, lyrical in the slow parts.  I find this to be a good way to approach Bruckner scherzos because well, that's how they are.  No one can touch Karajan in the adagio in this work, but that is a summit that no one will ever likely be able to scale.  But Rattle isn't trying to take on Karajan, and what we get fits in with the rest of his vision.  Rattle tries to show us the connections between the movements, and the result is a line that goes from the beginning of the symphony to the end, which brings me to my next point.<br />It's not easy to guess what a composer would have done, but there have been some very good attempts over the years, such as the work done with Mahler's 10th, Elgar's 3rd, and so on.  Out of all the work done with matters of this nature, this realization of the finale to Bruckner's 9th is very faithful to the composer.  We are still very much in the realm of Bruckner here.  There's no attempt to change the way in which Bruckner wrote.  All of the trademarks are here - the alternation between massive brass chorales, lyrical melodies in the strings, a powerful coda - there's no mistake that anyone other than Anton Bruckner wrote this.  It also gives Simon Rattle a chance to make a permanent stamp in the Bruckner pantheon. After all, this music hasn't been heard before.  Rattle and the orchestra play with the utmost commitment to Bruckner's fleshed out vision.  I can't find much to criticize musically with this finale.  It looks back to the first movement for some inspiration, but I won't call this a bad thing.<br />  Technically, all of the aspects one could hope for are there.  The Berliners play with their usual superhuman virtuosity.  I cannot reiterate enough how fortunate we are to have these musicians in our midst.  Sonically, this is about as good as it gets in the Philharmonie.  Not even in the heyday of Karajan were the sonics ever world class, but every section is well recorded.  The brass in particular are hefty in tone, and this is important in Bruckner.  I hope one day that EMI can get decent sonics out of this problematic hall. All in all, we should be very grateful for this recording.  One can only hope for a return to a time when recordings streamed out of Berlin with regularity.ut every section is well recorded.

B005MYEPXC|4.0|This is the first time I've watched this Woody Allen film since its theatrical release in June, 2011.  I liked it then and I like it even more now.  Owen Wilson, subbing for a role Allen would normally play years ago, is Gil a successful screenwriter for U. S. television.  He doesn't like his job much and has been working on a book, hoping it will lead to a career as a novelist.  He has travelled to Paris with his fianc&eacute;e, Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents to make wedding arrangements.<br /><br />Inez bumps into old acquaintances played by Michael Sheen and Nina Arianda.  Paul (Sheen) obviously has eyes for Inez that suggests a previous relationship.  He, Carol (Arianda) and Inez are looking to see the city and its environs but once exploring some of the sights, Paul's arrogance and smugness comes into play.  In one scene he argues with a museum guide (former first lady of France Carla Bruni) about which woman was the wife of a famous artist and which was the mistress.  Gil, who's had enough of Paul's I'm-always-right pontificating says he just finished the biography of Rodin and the guide is correct.  Of course he hadn't.<br /><br />This all leads up to Gil's solo night time strolls through the neighborhoods of Paris.  At the stroke of midnight he is magically taken back to the 1920's, an era of Hemingway, Dali, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Picasso and others.  He also meets Adriana (Marion Cotillard), one of Picasso's lovers.  They have an immediate attraction, but in this fantasy world, time is fleeting.<br /><br />When I saw this film the first time around, I spent too much time trying to figure out the time travel component of the film.  Is this a dream?  Is Gil hallucinating? Is there another world occupying the space?  Forget about it.  This time, I just considered it movie magic and enjoyed the show.  Allen's script is terrific, especially when all the famous characters get to do their thing.  Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein, Corey Stoll as Ernest Hemingway and the seemingly everywhere now, Tom Hiddleston as Scott Fitzgerald are especially noteworthy.  Allen opens the film with some 4 to 5 minutes of beautiful dusk to dawn shots of Paris.  The City of Lights is another character in this wonderful character driven film.<br /><br />The Blu ray version of this film is transferred in 1.78:1 and 1080p.  Paris looks great.  Allen focuses on a color palet of yellow, brown and gold hues.  The night time scenes sparkle with all the Parisian lights.  Like most Woody Allen films the audio soundtrack is nothing special.  Delivered in DTS-HD Master Audio 3.0, everything is up front.  It might have been nice to have the surrounds in play in that there is a good deal of club scenes in addition to the soundtrack.  Still, it's not a big deal.  The audio is clear and effective.he seemingly everywhere now, Tom Hiddleston as Scott Fitzgerald are especially noteworthy.

B0059XTUXQ|3.0|The same night I watched this movie I was channel flipping and came across \\"Out of Africa\\" from 1985.  It starred Meryl Streep and Robert Redford.  I'd seen the movie before but watched several minutes out of comparative curiosity.  Meryl plays a headstrong Danish baroness/plantation owner in colonial Kenya.  She speaks English with what appears to be a perfect Danish accent.  The woman is remarkable which is also the correct adjective for her role as British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.  If not for her performance this film can easily be overlooked and would feel right at home on basic cable.<br /><br />While Thatcher's rise to power as the first woman prime minister is quite an accomplishment, it doesn't seem to be terribly interesting.  One of the problems is that the meat of her career doesn't begin until she's in her 20's.  There isn't much about her childhood.  All of this comes as the aging, depressed woman teeters on the edge of dementia.  It is those uncomfortable moments we get too much of.  Thatcher's life story would have played better with linear story telling but then we wouldn't have seen so much of the well done make-up artistry and Streep's well played old lady.  Was that the filmmaker's goal?<br /><br />It's too bad the story, style and script don't meet the standard established by Ms. Streep and the excellent video transfer.  Projected in a wide 2.35:1 aspect ratio in 1080p the film looks great.  Likewise the DTS-HD MA 5.1 is terrific.  Clear and perfectly situated.

B007788VY0|5.0|I have heard Boulez conduct these composers before and for what it is worth, it is different from any other interpretation in my experience and seemed to be more suited to these composers.  There is no such thing as a true and correct interpretation and so one must make up one's own mind.  For me it was like my first experience of Glenn Gould playing Bach - it just seemed so right.  Certainly Boulez creates the best of a certain type of interpretation, and I don't think anyone can match the kind of balance and elegance Boulez gets from his orchestras.  For these composers.  FYI - I think his own music is terrible and an evil influence on modern music.  But I am very glad he gets to direct orchestras.  Some conductors seem to think that this impressionistic music needs a romantic interpretation.  Especially for Ravel it needs a neoclassical approach.  A romantic approach for both composers is just not right.  It feels overdone because the romance is already built in to the music.  Keep it moving forward, and Boulez does that, without needing to draw out the nuances, which, again, are already in the music.  I think that some listeners will regard these masterpieces as having a definitive interpretation in this release highly welcomed.  Don't wait.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Wow!  I bought this book pretty much to see what all the hype was about without really knowing anything about it!  I started reading it and thought it was going to be just another typical romance novel and then BAM!!!  No spoilers here, but what came next was completely unexpected.  I almost didn't keep reading thinking it would become completely distasteful, but I am glad I did because although VERY sexy, it was just shy of crossing the too kinky line!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A most wonderful app, truly! It is so convenient to have Bible on hand for those times that I am not carrying my Bible and can just whip out my phone, Kindle etc.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Have you ever noticed how Kristen Stewart is seemingly only in movies where there are 2 guys always surrounding her (The \\"Twilights,\\" \\"Adventureland,\\" \\"The Yellow Handkerchief\\")?  Here she plays the titled Ms. White, the rightful heir to her father's throne, who is now imprisoned.  Dad was murdered on his wedding night (the mother of Snow died earlier) by the beautiful Ravenna (an evil, juicy Charlize Theron).  Ravenna, it appears makes use of her great beauty by marrying and eliminated various kings.  She pulls this off for many years because of a spell she received that requires her to drain the life from the kingdom's unspoiled young women.  Snow White is too young, so in the cell she goes.<br /><br />There are several episodes of the \\"mirror mirror on the wall\\" chant but this mirror isn't just an animated glass mirror.  It is gold and becomes molten (think \\"Terminator 2\\") and forms a humanoid shape.  This version of the Grimm classic is appropriately dark and full of filmmaker wizardry, including a colorful section of mushrooms with eyes, forest creatures and a white stag.  An obvious homage to the Walt Disney original.  While the film waffles back and forth between light and dark it also has a tendency to bog down just when it starts to get good.<br /><br />The battle scenes are PG-13 cool enough and Kristen Stewart is fetching in her battle armor, but the film falls short of \\"Game of Thrones\\" (numerous unintended comparisons) in style and substance.  After about 8 years of imprisonment the now a young woman, Snow White manages to escape and enters the dark forest ultimately engaging a would-be hunter (Chris Hemsworth) and a childhood friend (Sam Claflin) as fellow combatants in an effort to dethrone the evil queen.  To the filmmaker's credit, Snow doesn't spend any time thinking of romance with either of the hunks longing for her favors.  She's obviously too busy planning the overthrow.  So who's the fairest of them all?  My vote goes to Charlize Theron.
0345803485|1.0|Had I known this was originally written as a Twilight fanfiction I never would've picked it up. Makes sense why I didn't like the characters and saw ties to the characteristics of the Twilight protagonists. Nope, not for me. I prefer real literature.<br /><br />The last few reviews I read on this page are dead on: I feel like its written by a teenager. Ana doesn't act like a normal 22 year old virgin. She's like a sixteen year old girl. Which makes sense, since this was written originally as Bella Swan of Twilight, who is equally as obsessed with Edward as Ana is with Christian. If you're a giant fan of Twilight, go ahead and read, since this not only repaves the storyline of Twilight (lion falls for the lamb, etc) but also takes the honeymoon in Breaking Dawn further, like every Twihard wanted.<br /><br />The writer -- it's hard to use the word author in this sense -- needs a dictionary. Half the words she so eloquently use don't make sense. Nor do they work with American English. Folks in America hardly say \\"I'll go fetch it\\"  \\"I've my period\\" etc. I had to pretend the setting was in England to get around all of this so my brain wouldn't explode. Then there's the repetition. It's one thing to create character development..but seriously, how many times does somebody roll their eyes? I got sick of Jose saying \\"Dios Mio\\" every time he spoke, Ana saying \\"Oh my...\\" \\"He's so freaking hot\\" and fighting with her \\"inner goddess\\" and her \\"subconscious\\" in a very angel/demon type way. That aspect of the story had actual potential, but was inconsistent in their respective desires as subconscious characters.<br /><br />And the Adonis demi-god that Christian is? Get real...He's 26, has a jet, a helicopter, plays perfect piano, is a wine enthusiast, is a billionaire, comes from a perfect family, is a philanthropist, and his *one* negative is actually a positive because it causes Ana to \\"flush\\" every other page? I'm sorry, I know books are supposed to take us away from reality, but it also has to connect with the reader in some way -- no one, fictional or not -- is that perfect. And why, exactly, does society insist that stalking is romantic? I find Christian's abilities to stalk Ana quite creepy.<br /><br />The sex is dull, albeit decent for some who haven't read true erotica before. You'd do better finding one that didn't originate as some adolescent desire for Edward Cullen to tie her down and flog her.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game got me obsessed its fun and addictive i love it and im thankful its finally on kindle and because its free GET THIS APP!!
0205632645|5.0|I discovered this book reading \\"On writing\\" by Stephen King. I'm a French published writer but, as I'm going to marry an American guy and to live in America, I decided I had to teach myself to become an American writer... \\"The elements of style\\" are a good help and I recommand this tiny but so useful book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|A little hard to follow but keeps me entertained. I would recommend to others. Thanks for the free app. Way to Go. Fun for the kids too
B0086700CM|5.0|great game and lots of fun. controls work ok but not the best. try this game and you will love it
B0086700CM|5.0|so awsome I play it all the time. turn jump or slide is the instructions so play for free. ive waited so long
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I played the free version and was hooked! I haven't seen any ads in the paid version I now have. It's not just a game, you follow this guy on a archeology quest finding pieces of artifacts. You gain the trust of the people who have said artifacts by playing and winning Mahjong. You get up to 4 awards each time play based on how well you play. You also get additional little artifacts for being really good at it. I've played Mahjong for years and this is the best version I've seen so far.
B003H9MSPG|2.0|my reloading handle broke so I half to use a screw driver to caulk it and it wont even go 10 feet I recommend the vortex versions of nerf
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you've read the first book, you've probably fallen in love with Christian. Read this second book and get hooked on him even more. This sequel is darker indeed and I congratulate the author for having told the story of an amazing character through the other person's point of view. What the author did was not easy considering the very complex character of Christian Grey. This is storytelling at its finest.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I did not hesitate when I saw that Temple Run was on the amazon app store and it was FREE
B0087DFIOU|5.0|This is another Mel Gibson action thriller with the right amount of humor, drama, and mystery tossed in. The movie opens with Mel and his accomplice dressed as clowns running away from the police. In order  to escape they jump the fence into Mexico where crooked Mexican cops imprison Gibson to keep him silent and take his money...about 2 million dollars. Why? Because killing Americans in Mexico is too hard to do. Once you get over that, Mel is sent to a Mexican prison, which is more like a Mexican village, where he survives by using his criminal street smarts.<br /><br />He befriends a street smart 10 year old boy (Kevin Hernandez) and his mother (Dolores Heredia). There are major criminal elements within the prison. The boy, who has a love for tobacco and is considered off limits to the criminals, has a secret, as does Mel. \\"There is something you're not telling us.\\"<br /><br />Plenty of bullets, killing, with some token torture tossed in. Drama and quips we have come to expect from a Gibson feature.<br /><br />F-bombs, no nudity, implied sex, near rape. 4 1/2 STARS.
0545403359|5.0|The book was in excellent condition; looked brand new.  I loved the story.  What really made me like it so much was that it was written from the perspective of the horse.  This is a very good story for young kids since is was so easy to read, but as an adult, I also enjoyed it very much.
B007P6VM04|3.0|The CD is just ok. as is the show.  Kind of sorry I purchased it. I guess I thought it would be better.  I do like Kathryn McPhee.  She is great.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a lot of fun I just wish I could do more without,  spending money. I do enjoy returning repeatedly as my character. rest.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|If you have seen the first two films you already know the plot. J and K battle special effect aliens to save the planet. Add some minor eye candy and a little cheese and we have a hit movie. In this one there is the element of time travel which excited me as much as the aliens did in Indian Jones when I found out about it. However, it works out well.<br /><br />There is no introduction of characters. The film assumes you know them and the MIB story. They pick up with the same running gags as the previous films, only now they have lost some humor. J is the only person not effected by the change in time, he is still part of MIB, and is the only person alive who remembers K who dies 40 years ago.<br /><br />Josh Brolin plays the 1969 agent K magnificently. Interesting aspect of the past life of K. I loved the NY Mets of 1969. Good climax scene for the big screen although I would wait for the DVD (you're going to add it to your collection anyway).<br /><br />No f-bombs, sex, or nudity
B004I1K2NW|5.0|I've been wanting a DVD of this film since DVD came around. The (very new) CGI concepts, the acting, the ghosts, everything just seemed to demand so much more attention than I ever gave. So when the anniversary BD was released, I finally bit the ectoplasmic bullet and grabbed it as soon as possible. The story most folk should know - psychic con man Bannister (Fox) wrangles ghosts to 'haunt' places so he can extort money for a mock exorcism. It's like the kid that cried wolf - the wolf, er... ghost, finally shows up and starts tearing everything apart.<br /><br />The digital transfer is amazing, and it is a rare case where I am more than pleased with the 5.1 DTS-HD and won't rant about my wanting 7.1 sound for films. The behind-the-scenes material is so good, it has its own behind-the-scenes. Jackson literally was a visionary and he had filmed a tonne of extras mostly because he knew film buffs would love it, even before the advent of DVDs, let alone DVD-centric content.<br /><br />This is perhaps the best performance for Michael J Fox since the first Back to the Future. And it is also a great example of how computer tech should be used to create such ghostly horrors without getting campy effects shots. Unfortunately, horror does not effectively marry with comedy as much as we might like, or as well as some might like. But at least we have this bit of golden goodness to add to our collections.<br /><br />And if you have the DVD, I've got two words for you: director commentary. The BD has Peter Jackson's first to date commentary, showing us and commenting on the deleted scenes that were added for the director's cut. So if you are a fan, updating to BD is more than worth it.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />The first season of \\"Mad Men,\\" American Movie Classics' original flagship drama, beautifully lays out the involved dramatic satire in its thirteen episodes.  Featuring one of the most versatile ensemble casts on television, the show is remarkable for providing genuine entertainment while also providing very thoughtful material for the intellect.<br /><br />Centering on the fictitious ad agency Sterling Cooper and its charmingly egotistical top creative mind Don Draper(Jon Hamm in an iconic performance), the show satirizes the image of clean early 1960's America by highlighting masculine sexual dominance in the office and strongly patriarchal gender roles in the home.  A fairly sharp postmodern repudiation of that era of American culture, the show is incisive in having little or no ties to modern America.  Instead, the actions of a character can make an in-the-moment critique of a given stuation, and it imbues the show with a sense of timelessness.<br /><br />Character development drives the show, whether in the workplace or in the Draper household.  Robert Morse is excellent as Bert Cooper, a slightly gentler counterpoint to John Slattery's loutish Roger Sterling.  Vincent Kartheiser makes an indelible impression as ruthless young business shark Peter Campbell, and Elisabeth Moss is perfect as Peggy Olson, a sharp young secretary who wants more for herself.  Also noteworthy in the cast is a pitch-perfect January Jones as Betty Draper.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray picture and sound is extremely sharp.  The package also includes informative extra featurettes on the period, and thorough commentaries by cast and crew on every Season One episode.<br /><br />The season also unfolds a compelling mystery regarding Don Draper's identity.  Episode highlights are \\"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes\\" \\"Babylon,\\" \\"Red In The Face,\\" and \\"Nixon VS. Kennedy.\\"  Season One of \\"Mad Men\\" announces itself as a rare animal, a period drama with incisively salient points to make on contemorary society.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is great! Very easy to play. I play it often. Thanks to the creators of it. Everyone should try it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great read, especially is you like a good story on rebellion and overcoming the tragic events that take place. The author just grabs you with this twisted plot and the reader is unable to set this book down. I can't wait to read the second book! BTW- Way better read then the movie!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have heard some reviews about laginig but mine doesn't really fun, addictive and best of all FREE!!!!! So,  go get it!!!
0375869026|5.0|The protagonist of Wonder, Auggie Pullman, spoke to my heart on more levels than my own experience with my child's craniofacila anomaly, and for that I was pleasantly surprised and very grateful. I was glad to read a book so well crafted not just for the middle and high school set but equally for adults as well. Wonder is full of the redeeming qualities of friendship, hope, braveness, perseverance, and kindness. This book should be read aloud in every fifth grade classroom. I am very excited to be able to read this to my own children. It is a triumph of the human spirit and a labor of love from the author. It shows. I am thankful to the little girl who inspired the book, and it goes to show how the smallest among us can have a huge impact on many lives.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this for my fire!!! I downloaded it the first day available. I just wish it wouldn't buffer so much cause it makes you die. but awesome game!!!! so addictive
160094048X|5.0|This is the 4th cookbook of Isa's that I've purchased and I'm not disappointed.  The chocolate chip cookie recipe turned out well without needing to use any ingredients that look or sound weird to non-vegans.  I love making things without eggs and seeing the surprise on people's faces when they hear that they can get the same binding effect of eggs with things they already have in their pantry.  The chocolate chip cookies were a big hit with two picky boys and an omni man.

B000002GBD|5.0|Nazareth's HAIR OF THE DOG is one of the most outstanding albums in the annals of rock/metal. It ranks up there with PARNOID, ZEPPELIN II, APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION, BALLS TO THE WALL, BACK IN BLACK, SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE, RIDE THE LIGHTNING, SYMBOLIC, ACT III, TURN LOOSE THE SWANS, THE OATH, THE MANTLE, THE GODDESS, OMEGA WAVE, NOSFERATU, and the like.<br /><br />Although Nazareth were never progressive in the typical sense, they tended to experiment a lot from album to album and therefore refused to be categorized. Were they rock, metal, pop, blues or what? On HAIR OF THE DOG they chose the metal route and this is one kick-axx metal CD. A lot of Nazareth's 70s and 80s material sounds dated to my ears (although they have a lot of worthy material), but not HAIR OF THE DOG. The album may have been released in 1975, but it's a timeless metal/rock recording, pure and simple.<br /><br />Of course everyone knows the radio staples \\"Hair of the Dog\\" and \\"Love Hurts.\\" The former is both heavy and ultra-catchy with Dan McCafferty's patented gravelly vocals. Even my mother (R.I.P.), who could never warm up to anything heavier than the Beetles, confessed to liking the song and expressed how catchy it was! \\"Love Hurts\\" was a modernization of The Everly Brothers' ballad and the band really made it their own.<br /><br />\\"Miss Misery\\" is a Sabbath-inspired doomy masterpiece as Dan laments a witchy woman he foolishly got involved with. Everything meshes together for a brilliant classic piece - the vocals, the lyrics, the guitars and drums. Although the rhythm guitar is ultra-simple, sometimes \\"simplicity is the composer's greatest tool.\\"<br /><br />\\"Please Don't Judas Me\\" is even doomier, but not in the heavy-chord sense. It's kind of gothic with a semi-chanted chorus and marching beat. The lyrics are strong as Dan beseeches the listener to not do him wrong.<br /><br />\\"Changing Times\\" is another highlight with a more driving Zeppelin-esque tempo.<br /><br />\\"Beggars Day\\" is more rock than metal, but Dan's raspy vocals break it into the realm of metal. Brian Johnson obviously took lessons from McCafferty (not to mention Accept's Udo and even Axl Rose to some degree). \\"Rose in the Heather\\" is a sweet instrumental coda, melodically `acoustic' with a lead guitar.<br /><br />\\"Whiskey Drinkin' Woman\\" is a cool Lynyrd Skynyrd-esque number.<br /><br />The mellow ballad \\"Guilty\\" was replaced by \\"Love Hurts\\" for the USA release. Needless to say, \\"Love Hurts\\" is vastly superior and it was a good decision to switch them.<br /><br />The name of the album and title song - \\"Hair of the Dog\\" - was always a mystery to me until I discovered that it was originally intended to be \\"Heir of the Dog,\\" i.e. another way of saying `son of a biyatch,' which, of course, is the phrase used in the unforgettable chorus.<br /><br />Although the band's name harkens from Nazareth, PA, of all places, it naturally evokes the home town of Jesus Christ in Israel. Interestingly, the incredible cover art is a stylized depiction of the multi-headed \\"beast\\" that comes out of the sea, as depicted in Revelation 13:1-2.<br /><br />Needless to say, HAIR OF THE DOG was Nazareth's magnum opus; everything magically came together on this outstanding, potent work. Never to be repeated; it stands alone in the Nazareth catalog. It's a must-have for any rock/metal listener.<br /><br />GRADE: A+rock than metal, but Dan's raspy vocals break it into the realm of metal.

B000KJU1MS|5.0|I am a fan from the glory days of the band. Having this collection was something I dreamed of in my teens, especially when the band began to seem to lose sight of what made them special to their fans. To see them when they were still raw and hungry to truly be \\"The Hottest Band In The World\\" is a must...not just for KISS fans, but for fans of the classic rock era. Love them or hate them, this band changed the face of music.<br /><br />The sound quality may not be the greatest at times. and the sound can be a bit iffy, but that adds to the feel. Also, the segment for Don Kirschner's Rock Concert was like stepping into the Wayback Machine.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|I have and love my Standard DVD Godfather collection but would someone please explain why reviewers here do not mention the quality of the Blu Ray transfer for both audio and video.  Why is it that so many focus on plot summary, acting good or bad, and whether their father liked the movie so they bought it for them.  All that is irrelevant.  I need to know, regardless of the which movie is being reviewed, about the transfer quality.  Why is this collection transferred as a lossy audio\\"?  Are the surrounds properly used and is the video transfer really any better on Blu Ray or is it Standard Def transcoded to Blu Ray without improving the quality?<br />Why can't Amazon separate the Blu Ray reviews from the Standard Def reviews?<br />Why are the 'most helpful' positive and negative always 8 year old reviews?  Can't they use a recent review to highlight the movie as there may have been upgrades and updates since the initial release.<br />If Amazon movie reviews are going to be helpful, lets stop the nonsense plot summaries and talk about the quality of the discs themselves.<br />  Sorry for the rant but this is how I feel.<br /><br />4/4/2013<br /><br />I realize that no one will probably now see this since it has been buried under a myriad number of streaming reviews and other people's summaries but I received the blu ray collection and have just finished watching the last film.<br />There is no question in my mind that we have a great restoration with this collection and a gorgeous restoration, especially, of the first two film.  For all 3 movies there is a warm coloration even in the very deliberately darker scenes and they successfully reached a true black 0 IRE for those whose systems can demonstrate the collection's excellence. There remains the low level film grain and soft focus that you don't see in too many modern movies.<br /><br /> In Godfather 1 the lossless True HD is clear with very perfectly set audio levels.  There is some use of the discreet channels for foley effects but not much though some panning across the front stage is present.  For the most part, your surrounds are used for ambience at low levels.<br /><br />Godfather 11's lossless audio continues in that vein with some very nice pans and speaker directionality but , again, most everything will be through your center speaker.  The soundtracks, however, have a nice even spread across the stage.<br /><br />Godfather 3 is the one most panned and yet I never found it bad at all.  Like the other 2, it retains the warm, golden coloration and film grain and the lossless audio remains in the front and, again, mostly through the center channel.<br /><br />The extras disc contains a great number of deleted scenes, some broadcast on TV but were not included in the theatrical releases, and some I do not recall seeing before.  All the commentaries and extras from the 2001 collection release are included as well as a very worthy bunch of new extras, making this collection that much more valuable. One great extra was the 'Emulsional Rescue' which discusses and demonstrates how the restoration was done.<br /><br />In my opinion, this collection is a very worthy purchase and I hope this review has been of some help.for foley effects but not much though some panning across the front stage is present.

B005IQZB14|5.0|A delightful encounter with  intelligence , courage, and suburb writing.  If you have ever pondered having to grow through a life inhibited with a feeling of meaninglessness, &/or indulging in destructive behavior this book is for you.  Or if that is not your scenario but you enjoy  artistic talent expressed in beautiful pros, about self exploration, adventure, being vernal able;  and face it all with physical and mental courage, then again this is the book for you. It is too graphic to be made up and to humbling not to  be sincere. Walden Pond was about trying to get centered in early Americana.  This is a book about trying to get centered in 21 first century America.  If you are searching, thinking, & wondering what the hell is life all about?  This book will, at the least, give you a different milieu to frame these questions in.

0439023521|2.0|I read this book because it was $5 on Kindle, and the ladies at my job wouldn't stop talking about it. I didn't care. and that is a problem. Katniss is not likable. Neither is Lisbeth Salander from Dragon Tattoo, but she made me care. There are long stretches talking about hunger and thirst, so boring.  The world the author attempted to build was thin and sparse. And I am not \\"crying racism\\", but the only \\"dark brown\\" people from the 1. same district 2. who worked in fields 3. that sang to communicate and 4.That had a moon as it's \\"symbol\\"? GTFOH. I don't understand why Katniss didn't bring the plants from the other side of the fence to her back yard. The over-all positive attitude of the people in the Capital. The Hunger Games is a punishment, stop treating it like a fun prize with fabulous food and clothes. It was all over the place. Probably like my review is. Also I didn't laugh once. Any good book, no matter the genre will make you laugh at least once. Not this one.
B005T87QCI|5.0|the best game I played on the kindle but add a few more robots like atom, Zeus, and twin cites to make it awesome
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Krugman is talking about ways to end this economic depression that have been tested throughout the history of the last century.  Everyone needs to read this book and know why they should only vote for political leaders who won't stand in the way of these time tested solutions.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Ok, not to be mean, but after reading the first couple pages I was already putting the book down, wondering why it was a bestseller.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is addicting as hell! This game is evry kids dream. running out of a temple with an idol is absolutely fun.
B0086700CM|4.0|Glad this game finally made its way to the Fire! Has an occassional lag but other than that its a great game!
B007R41E8O|4.0|...cost this game a star.  should be five stars.  alawar games randomly interrupt play to make you view an annoying splash screen.  extremely intrusive.  i expect free games to shove ads in my face but apps I paid for?  not cool.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|In the conclusion to the Hunger Games trilogy, we learn what happens when the oppressed have their Mockingjay to rally behind.  This book, like The Hunger Games and Catching Fire are definitely written more for the younger audiences, however the underlying story is well thought out and decently paced enough that even the older \\"child\\" in most adults could enjoy the story.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love it! it is so much fun. the lagging sucks. if it didn't do that it. would be five stars.
B005LAIHIQ|2.0|Love DARK SHADOWS, both series. Been a fan since I was six years old in  the 60's. Love TIM BURTON. His takes on Batman and Alice were superb and his NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS was and is a wonder to behold. Have always liked JOHNNY DEPP since his ELM STREET debut. But what a mess this was. Saw it twice in case I may have judged too harshly. Was worse the second time around. Depp's characterization is marvelous, the decor is marvelous, the prologue is marvelous, some of the in jokes about the 70's are marvelous. What's bad? The script, the rest of the characters-actors, some of the dramatic license taken with story plot lines, the music (and I love Danny Elfman), the complete absence of eerieness the series was known for, the ending which looked like it came out of a Michael Bey movie, Carolyn the Werewolf, and Eva Green, Eva Green, Eva Green as Angelique. Thankfully, the movie is not performing well enough to warrant a sequel. Unfortunately, this could mean the end of any further DS projects from anyone.
B006FE83UE|5.0|One of my all-time favorites!  Now, I have it in my personal collection.  This anniversary edition has lots of extras which the true To Kill a Mockingbird fan will enjoy.
0385344228|4.0|Is this novel a courtroom drama, a psychological study of a family, an introspective study of a man, or is it about truth and justice?  Or all of the above?  It's hard to tell in this rambling book which attempts to keep the reader in suspense and leaves much to the imagination.<br /><br />Andy Barber, the First Assistant DA in Newton, MA, is thee man who faces the questions posed by the story and really doesn't come to grips with the essential problems raised.  His 14-year-old son is accused of murdering a fellow student and goes to trial for Murder One.  Did he or didn't he?  Andy, who initially ran the original investigation, does not believe his son is capable of doing the deed.  The effect of the pressures of the trial on Andy and his wife are weakly described.  The courtroom drama is, to some extent, extremely well done, but, for the most part, drawn out to a great degree.  And the snideness of the comments about Andy's replacement when he's taken off the case and during the trial are too often petty.<br /><br />On the whole, the novel is an interesting presentation, but could have been edited severely, especially the front end which drags on slowly until the book picks up steam toward the middle.  It is no spoiler to note that there is more than one surprise waiting for the reader at the end, some attention-grabbing, others a little far-fetched.  That said, it is an off-beat novel that is recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have it on my ipod and I have been waiting foreever to get it on my kindle. I'm already half way through the objectives. Definently worth it. Its really addictive too!(:
B00457X8BC|2.0|Kurt Wallender gets caught up and lost in the gloomy world of the soviet remains of  Latvian chaos in this one and he does not do well.  My reading device says I have slogged my way through 88% this mess of a book along with him.  The snow drifts have been high,damp dark and cold, but that marker tells me we will see the light in the cabin window soon, Kurt will bid a gloomy fairwell to that dispairing widow, leave his German passport behind, and get on that big plane back to Sweden where we belong.<br />What on earth was Hennning Mankel thinking? Where were his editors and publisher that they would even consider marketing this really dreadful story. It sounds like something put together around a campfire with a group of people getting drunker while the multiple sub-plots twist, turn, run into dead ends and often emplode in emptyness , subsummed in numerous black holes.<br /><br />Like many other readers if this had been the only Wallender story I ever attempted it would certainly be the last.  It is so bad!
B007P6VM04|4.0|Love the series, love the CD!  My only disappointment was that \\"Our Day Will Come\\" was not on the CD.  But...\\"History is Made at Night\\" is!  Keep this one in your car for a quick fix!!!

0345803507|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a controversial book that many people have been talking about. Some have called it Mommy porn but thats not true, yes it has some kinky scenes in it and alot of people may consider some of them degrading to women,but under the few bondage scenes was a totally captivating story of a man who is tormented from his past and his insecurities about himself and the woman who is so atracted to him and wants to help him, love him and make him see he is not fifty shades of messed up. This is truly a love story under all that kinky stuff. If you keep on reading and you have to read all three books you will get to a totally satisfying conclusion that actually left you wanting more of Christen Grey and Anastasia Steel's love. If as some others who have read them have said some of the scenes may have spiced up their love life well then that's a bonus LOL. This 3rd book is where the best of the love story comes out but you must read all 3 in order to under stand the characters and how far they have come.

B000ZELISO|3.0|J.K. Rowling's tale is, as always, rife with fresh ideas, and her believable characters continue to endure further challenges in the process of growing-up.  Apart from the story's more fanciful elements, there are also some real-life lessons being learned here (in boy-girl relationships and academic cheating among them).<br /><br />That said, Rowling's extensive narrative doesn't fit so comfortably into a two-and-a-half hour running time.  Screenwriter Steve Kloves manages to get most of it all to work within the prescribed length (though it is hard to see the point of invented scenes like Harry's flirtation with a muggle girl in the London tube station when that screen-time could have been alloted to more of Rowling's own ideas).<br /><br />Director David Yates handles the material adroitly, but his style feels more perfunctory than the series' previous directors.  One scene in particular (which I won't spoil), is a major -- and devastating -- turning point in Rowling's tale, but it lacks any dramatic intensity and proves something of a lead balloon.  The film is technically well-photographed (by Bruno Delbonnel) but is awash in low-key, shadowy lighting, and a generally drab, washed-out colour scheme.  While effective in the spookier moments, this look doesn't suit the scenes of intimacy or humor, and tends to cast a dreary pall about the film.  Nicholas Hooper provides a serviceable score, but it too is lacklustre compared to the symphonic grandeur of John Williams' Harry Potter music.<br /><br />However the performers are (as usual) first rate. The established cast bring ever-more freshness to their parts, while newcomer Hero Fiennes-Tiffin (nephew of Ralph Fiennes) makes for an unnervingly sinister Tom Riddle, and veteran actor Jim Broadbent makes a fine Professor Slughorn.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a wonderful story which results in a very good film.  Warner Bros. Blu-ray disc boasts an excellent transfer with crisp detail.  But it does lack the epic sweep of the earlier films and doesn't deliver a satisfying emotional payoff, and so proves one of the less-enjoyable Potter adaptations.

0061692042|5.0|In between the murder mysteries, the biographies, the histories and the feel good books, I sometimes find a book that speaks to me or resonates, a book in which I can become involved.  A good book is one you dive in and live.  A great book is one you wear.  While I am reading the latter kind of book I feel that I am living the life of the characters.  The feeling even lingers after finishing the book.  Canada is just such a book, and you would never believe that this could happen with a story that begins with the narrator telling us that his parents robbed a bank.  After reading everything Ford has written, I was waiting for true excellence.  This is close but I think that there is more to come.  Unlike some contemporary writers whose great works are in the past (John Irving comes to mind), I think Ford's greatest achievements are still to come.

0385504209|3.0|In The Da Vinci Code,  Dan Brown weaves a complex tale involving the Catholic church, the French police and the supposed descendants of Jesus Christ. He claims that Jesus Christ eloped with Mary Magdalene and that their descendants and documents concerning  the church are carefully guarded by the Priory of Sion, a secret society that practices Goddess worship. His main characters, Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist reminiscent of a bookish Indiana Jones, and Sophie Nehru, a French codebreaker who struggles to break any of the code she encounters, are forced in a treasure hunt for the \\"Holy Grail\\" by the murder of her grandfather by the Catholic Church.<br /><br /> Dan Brown studied at Amherst college and Phillips Exeter Academy, where he grew fascinated with the inverse correlation between science and religion. He has written numerous books on the conflict between secret societies and the modern world.<br /><br /> The author supports his controversial thesis with historical evidence relating to the council of Nicaea and the adoption of Christianity by the Roman Emperor Constantine. He also references scholars who support his claims through Langdon's thoughts. In writing the novel, Brown claims to have extensively research the topics and even interviewed members of organizations central to his plot.<br /><br /> One slightly frustrating detail of Browns deciphering of ancient art and architecture is that he is simply not a good enough writer to describe the pieces, and he does not include images of the works his novel deals so extensively with. Although Brown claims to have researched the topics he wrote about, there are numerous historical inaccuracies that both undermine his central claim and reduce his credibility as a writer. The Priory of Sion he writes about was proved to be an elaborate hoax developed by Pierre Plantard in the 1990's. Brown also misinterprets, or simply bends Gnostic beliefs about the divinity of Jesus into the basis of a Jesus Mary love affair. Brown has responded to these claims by not responding; he has continued to state that all of the history art and architecture listed in the novel is completely true, even when faced with overwhelming evidence that it is not.<br /><br /> The books argument is not convincing, because the author uses historical inaccuracies and goes in circles too much to make a definitive case for his argument.  A quote on the Priory of Sion in the book, \\"They call themselves the Prieur&eacute; de Sion-the Priory of Sion. They're based here in France and attract powerful members from all over Europe. In fact, they are one of the oldest surviving secret societies on earth.\\"( Brown 113). At a Priory of Sion history website, \\" after asking Plantard to swear on Oath - Plantard admitted that he made everything up; whereupon Plantard was given a serious warning and advised not to \\"play games\\" with the French Judicial System.\\" ([...]). Dan Brown is contradicted by many sources and indeed the French government. This carelessness in composing a literary work casts doubt on the novel as a whole and debunks his overall claim.<br /><br /> This book different than any other historical fiction book I have read because rather than taking place in a different time period, it takes place in the modern day and references the historical past. It also deals with a very controversial topic, which is common among bestsellers as it instills curiosity in the reader.<br /><br /> This book would appeal to mystery readers or to people who love a good conspiracy theory, however I would not recommend this book to the general public because it is in general a badly written and badly referenced publicity stunt.to these claims by not responding; he has continued to state that all of the history art and architecture listed in the novel is completely true, even when faced with overwhelming evidence that it is not.

The only thing is to be cautious of the track and that is El Capitalismo Foráneo (Antipop Consortium Remix).  The rapper over that track needs to stick to his day job.
0140364536|5.0|For our family's summer reading selection, I picked the mammoth four-hundred-page Watership Down by Richard Adams. Some novels will feel like an endurance test just four pages in. Without fail, whenever I read Watership Down, those four hundred pages feel to me like a summer holiday. My husband, who groaned at the idea of reading such a long book about rabbits, instead has eagerly returned to the book whenever he has a spare minute.<br /><br />\\"The rabbits arrived at their new home - but I'm not even halfway through the book,\\" my husband observed. \\"What in the world can happen next?\\" Richard Adams never ceases to amaze me with how he handles pacing. On the surface, his rabbit tale is a fairly simple one: rabbits must escape their doomed warren and find a new home. In less capable hands, Watership Down would have been half as long and packed with chases, storms, brawls, and catastrophes. But Adams never hurries his tale. Often he stops to leisurely describe the scenery or to wax philosophical. Sometimes he even dedicates an entire chapter to a rabbit folktale. Yet these interludes rarely feel like interruptions; rather, these interesting descriptions, musings, and stories of the rabbit god Frith and the great trickster El-ahrairah increase the momentum. Adams also never resorts to implausible plot twists. Instead he is perfectly content to tell his simple tale and trust his readers to listen--and so we do.<br /><br />I am astounded at how imperfect and yet captivating are Adams' rabbits. Take Fiver, a runt who has been blessed with the gift of prophecy. Then there is Fiver's older brother, Hazel, whose greatest strength is his ability to identify and trust the strengths of others. By speaking with conviction of his trust in his brother's visions of doom, he convinces a small band of rabbits to leave the warren and seek a new home. Yet even he also makes errors in judgment. One day to prove his greatness as a leader, despite desperate warnings from Fiver, Hazel sets out to rescue pet rabbits from a nearby farm - and almost meets a violent end. Darker characters also exist. For example, let me introduce you to Strawberry who lives in a different warren. He hides a dark secret, which almost becomes the downfall of one of Hazel's companions. Despite his betrayal, he eventually joins Hazel's warren and becomes a great asset. And then there is Captain Holly. One of the powerful elite at the Sandleford warren, he attempts to arrest Hazel and his fellow rabbits to prevent them from leaving the warren. After failing to do so, he later seeks refuge at Hazel's new warren and becomes a valued contributor. These rabbits are fallible, allowing Adams to present many stirring moments of heartache and redemption.<br /><br />Adams considered the Berkshire countryside to also be a character in Watership Down. He certainly lavishes great attention to it. In a random survey which I conducted of twenty books for young people, over half of them dedicated their first paragraph to introducing character. And by character, I mean a human being or least an animal. Half of the books didn't refer to setting until the second paragraph or even the second page. And when they did, they often only dedicated one sentence to description. A particularly generous author may perhaps devote an entire early paragraph to setting. In contrast, Adams spends the first three paragraphs on the landscape. That's not to say Adams wastes time waxing poetic. In each paragraph, he details the scenery but also the place of the rabbits within it: \\"The May sunset was red in clouds and there was still half an hour to twilight. The dry slope was dotted with rabbits--some nibbling at their grass....\\" Those paragraphs might be long, but they effectively establish a tone of peace, which within a few pages is quietly interrupted. Readers are all the richer for how saturated in reality Watership Down really is.<br /><br />\\"No author today would think of writing a four-hundred-page book about rabbits,\\" my husband observed. Adams himself did not begin with such an audacious goal; Watership Down started out as story told by Adams to his daughters on car rides. As the years went on, his daughters encouraged him to share his story with the world, and finally he took the plunge and set the tale to paper. But Watership Down received so many rejections that Adams considered publishing it himself. Then a small-time publisher named Rex Collins accepted it for a two thousand copy run. Since that time it has rightfully sold millions of copies.ut rabbits,\\" my husband observed.

B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Not much dialogue, not a whole lot of action either, but that was all by design. Gosling played a man of very few words. His silent, nonchalant disposition added to the character's mystery. Albert Brooks did not go over the top to succeed as a frightening villain. His somewhat calm demeanor is what made him appear menacing. The technique of Less is More worked to perfection. A couple of the violent scenes were quite gory though, so prepare yourself for some sick special effects involving wounds and injuries. The first scene was one of the best openers to a movie I ever saw (the only dialogue came from a Laker's broadcast on the car radio.) Silence was used as an effective tool in creating suspense and tension throughout the film.

B0086700CM|4.0|This game is so much fun and addicting but it lags and is super annoying when it gets slow and the person runs into the tree and it wasn't your fault. Tried turning off wifi but no good.... frustrating. works flawlessly on my friends ipod touch... :(
B001FB5634|5.0|I saw this in the theatre, as it was a limited release nationally. Movie follows along with the book version quite well. Extremely depressing, post-apocalyptic movie with a focus on survival of father and son. This is not an action movie. This is more of an artsy movie that attempts to bond to the viewer. Cormac won a Pulitzer prize for the book.<br /><br /> Those of you dolts that are expecting something akin to the book of eli or a zombie movie, move along and go watch the jersey shore, because you obviously dont have the intellect for this or the book. You perpetuate the typical stupid fat american.
030771652X|2.0|Bee, a 26 year old career woman living in New York City, travels to London when her bohemian 21 year old sister, Tess, turns up missing. Bee's sleuthing leads to the discovery of Tess's body in a derelict toilets building in Hyde Park. Her wrist has been slit with a brand new Sabatier knife and she has died of exsanguination. The police rule it a suicide. Bee cannot accept that her sister would kill herself and begins her own investigation, giving up her job in New York and her fiance to do so. She lives in Tess's rather run down apartment and even starts waiting tables/tending bar where Tess used to work to make ends meet.<br /><br />I found this story implausible, convoluted and maudlin for the reasons listed below. It is not likely that I will read Rosamund Lupton's newest book, Afterwards, following my disappointment in her debut novel.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />We learn that Tess was pregnant, had discovered the baby had cystic fibrosis, enrolled in a gene therapy trial where the baby was cured of CF, then delivered a stillborn just days before her body was discovered. By the end of the book we are supposed to believe that this gene therapy trial using an artificial chromosome to introduce a healthy CF gene in utero had been hijacked by the gynecologist delivering the babies. Instead he was using an active virus vector for an illegal genetic enhancement trial of an IQ gene. Furthermore, the IQ gene coded for memory capacity and lung function so that the babies couldn't breathe when they were born.<br /><br />This is revealed through a series of conversations with Mr. Wright, an attorney at the Crown Prosecution Services (CPS) offices. They are discussed in letters that Bee is writing to her deceased sister. However, at the end of the book it is revealed that Mr. Wright was an imaginary person that Bee had used to assist her in writing these letters.<br /><br />Suspects include the father of the baby, Emilio Codi, a tutor at Tess's art college and a married man whose current wife is expecting, as well as one of Tess's fellow art students, Simon Greenly, who had an unrequited crush and unhealthy fixation on the beautiful Tess.<br /><br />Bee and Tess's younger brother, Leo, died of CF when he was only 8. Their father left their mother around this time and Bee was sent off to boarding school. Their relationships or lack of are covered in great detail in Bee's flashbacks and letters to Tess.married man whose current wife is expecting, as well as one of Tess's fellow art students, Simon Greenly, who had an unrequited crush and unhealthy fixation on the beautiful Tess.<br /><br />Bee and Tess's younger brother, Leo, died of CF when he was only 8.

B006PHD0RW|5.0|if it wasn't for my daddy I wouldn't have all the bags unlocked. he had to pay $3 so I could have all the bags but it was worth it. he even paid one $ for just getting the app. he is the best. unlike I said on the fake phone app this app is so for the kindle. I just don't like how they brig u to give them 5 stars and if u give them 5 stars they will be your best friend forever. well anyways this is defiantly the best app ever. if u travel a lot (like me) this app keeps u occupied. I never get bored on this app. even when I'm watching my favorite Tv show (good luck Charlie) I still pull out my kindle and at this game. there r no stuff wrong with this app. dads r the best. well at least mine is. my friends dad is in jail :(  so so so sad
B0086700CM|5.0|My co-worker got me involved in this game and I loved it from the first try. Now my whole family loves it. From my 1 yr old son (loves watching the monkeys chase the guy) and my 5 yr old daughter who is better at it than me to my 43 yr old husband. What a great fun game.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|its not worth the money. because of the levels. but the he and birds are beeeaaasssttttt. if you think its 5 staars your to eaasyy

B007KDFWRG|5.0|Update: After listening to this CD set for 2 weeks, my initial very positive reaction is confirmed and strengthened. While some may not like the extended versions of the songs on this CD (many clock in at 10 minutes plus), I think they are superior to the studio versions. They capture the energy and the high level of musicianship that I heard when I saw the TTB live. The jamming and soloing that extends these performances always has purpose and direction, skillfully providing variation on the basic melodies and song structures. (And what would be the point of a live CD that simply duplicated the studio versions anyway?) All this plus the finest female voice in blues/rock make this one of my favorite CDs.<br /><br />About 6 or 7 years ago, I saw both the Susan Tedeschi Band and the Derek Trucks Band perform separately but on the same bill at a concert in Baltimore. ST & DT each came out for a song or two with the other's band, but it was two distinct bands performing. I remember thinking at the time that combining the two into a single band would be a great move. DTB's singer, who also appears on Everybody's Talkin', is very good, but there's something about Susan's powerful, female voice-- and the contrast it provides to the heavy and well-played blues/soul/funk of DT & company-- that takes things to the next level.<br /><br />Everybody's Talkin' is a terrific concert CD. It mixes extended versions of songs from their studio album, Revelator, with covers of classics. While I tend to be wary of such efforts and the tendency of extended jams to dissolve into aimless noodling, that is generally not the case here as this band has the chops to pull it off. The result is something that is both familiar and different from what Revelator (a very good CD in its own right) has to offer. Highly recommended.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I got this game for my grand daughters. They love it, who wouldn't love feeding this little creature candy? What fun ! ! !
B0086700CM|5.0|Very fun and deceptively hard to play. The controls make it seem very easy but its certainly harder than it looks.
B0073PPKNM|2.0|I was really looking forward to this new CD but sadly I couldn't get through it. I am not sure why she chose to move in this direction. I can speculate but won't. Don't let this CD inform your decision to listen to Melody. Her previous CD's are truly originals. They showcase her talent and uniqueness as a singer and songwriter.

B001NZEHMS|5.0|This is the album that put the Beasties on the map and, along with Run DMC, revolutionized the genre.  Slinging rhymes in their unique staccato style and lyrical mastery, the Beastie Boys and [[ASIN:B0000024JN Licensed to Ill]] was Eminem for the for the 80s generation.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is great entertainment. My wife and I loved the special effects, the surprises, the humor, the action and the outright fun of it! The visuals were epic eye-candy. The casting was very well done and the story was engaging. We almost never buy movies (or go to watch them in the theaters) between our hectic lives and lack of available funds for entertainment, so when we took the chance on John Carter with a few hours and a few dollars (both precious to us) we felt like we got more than we could have hoped for. We can't wait for the DVD to get here as we are already prepping for family movie night and warning family and friends that our phones will be off the day of release!
0786956291|5.0|got this to learn the basics. i was very pleased with the quality and how everything is explained in the walk through. haven't played the adventure contained in the DM guide yet. but i am sure i will be pleased with it. also it came with a code to download a extra story the wizards website. now just have to get some friends together to play.

B00828JCI8|5.0|Great character development this season, good departure from the usual formula as this last episode was really well done.  Can't wait for Season 6!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Me encanto, la puesta es genial, los protagonistas espectaculares, fue la mejor versión del Fantasma que he visto hasta ahora! Me hubiese encantado haber podido disfrutarla en vivo!<br />Altamente recomendable!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The books are great.  Well written and a quick read.  The concept was difficult to imagine and yet looking at the world today it is entirely possible that something of this nature could occur.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I was introduced to this movie buy a communications major who had to break down the Communications Theory in this movie, I agreed to watch the movie just so we could banter back and forth later. Instead, I became a huge advocate of the movie and have introduced numerous people to it. This movie is that based in a setting that's getting more and more common of the police state. The regime in this case has locked people down to the \\"curing\\" human emotion. Very well made movie, I highly recommend it. It also has very little \\"inappropriate content\\" (note though, it IS rated \\"R\\" for violence), although the sexual content is pretty minimal and all is in good taste.<br /><br />There are a few \\"troubling\\" scenarios that will elicit some sad responses, but towards the end of the movie you find yourself cheering on the protagonist while still attempting to understand where the regime is coming from. It really has you thinking (which I'd argue is a good thing... although it does mean that potentially you would have to be \\"awake\\" to enjoy the movie) but it has great replay value. I don't even want to try to figure out how many times I've watched this movie :) Just put it in, and watch it again!<br /><br />Pros: Quality movie, good acting, great story, well-written plot, decent \\"real\\" interaction between characters<br /><br />Cons: Low-budget film, and sometimes it becomes well, pretty obvious.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this film, the low-budget issue discussed above ends up really not being important and is more of an \\"Oh! I see what you did there...\\" sort of moment. Doesn't detract from the film. Good film from a number of different aspects.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it. its a really great game. very addicting you wont get enough of it. I play it everyday. they need to incorporate more levels though then it would be even better
B0086700CM|5.0|THIS GAME IS SOO ADDICTIVE!!! I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN THE FIRST DAY AND I PLAY IT AT LEAST ONCE A DAY NOW. :) GET IT GET IT GET IT!

B0028IDXDS|5.0|Our baby loved this, and it is easy for an infant to hold and not lose.  Even after stopping all other pacifiers he loves to have this with him in the car.<br /><br />We have also bought these for two baby showers and the parents loved them.  They get more oohs and ahhs that much more expensive gifts.
B007IFZU5A|5.0|I have liked this band for some time now. This could be one of their best and yes I have everything they put out.Just a really good record you can zone out to and feel.
0517543052|5.0|There are 8 limbs or branches of yoga (Raja, Hatha, Bhakti, etc.) and Ram Das has put together a classic that explains it plainly and with humor plus insight. Starting out with his time at Harvard U and continuing through his trip to India, he explains his personal story of transformation. The last third of the book gives practical exercises in meditation and advice on life for the yogi/yogini.Your yoga library is not complete without it!
0307730697|4.0|Fearless by Eric Blehm was an amazing example of what it means to leave a LEGACY for family,friends and country. Also Adam Brown truely lived fearlessly because he knew he was safe in life and death with his Savior and Lord Jesus Christ. Adam's story is not only full of courage,sacrifice, and boldness but its an amazing tribute to all those who serve.the only minor issue i noticed was the authors story telling ability wasn't always seamless, but not a big deal. Which in itself is amazing, nonetheless the fact that Adam was an Elite solider who learned to be the best of the best twice because of a debilitating injury early in his service career. When I think of the most dangerous,thankless, and physically challenging jobs a person can have I think of being a U.S. Navy Seal and this book does not disappoint in reaffirming that fact. \\"As a rule, we don t endorse books or movies or anything regarding the command where I work - and Adam Brown worked - but as the author writes in Fearless, you have to know the rules, so you know when to bend or break them This is one of those times. Read this book. Period. It succeeds where all the others have failed.\\"<br />-Anonymous SEAL Team SIX Operator<br /><br />I recommend this book to all who even remotely are interested in military SEAL memoirs or life legacy.
B0019N95IK|5.0|If this series was on SciFi, like it should have been, it would have lasted at least seven seasons. Just imagine the interactions with the Andorians, Klingons and Romulans if they had continued this great show. Hopefully, one day we'll get a movie version.
B0086700CM|5.0|At first I wasn't sure about it. But after I played it, I was hooked! Great Fun!!  Only bad thing is there is only one level and you start at the beginning every time you die.
0312330537|5.0|Shantaram is the well-told story of an Australian prison escapee who flees to India.  There he witnesses, metes out, and is the victim of man's inhumanity to man. . .but he also experiences the redemptive power of love and service.  Shantaram provides an intimate and articulate look into the slums of Bombay, international crime, war, and prison life. From first page to last, the book was totally fascinating.  I could not put my Kindle down!
B00005N6KG|5.0|You hardly know you have them on except for the great sound.  No pressure on the ears or head, no heat build up.  Rugged as all get out.  Been bouncing around in my RV and home for years, but still deliver the sound of head phones costing a great deal more.
0061128562|5.0|There is a lot of fun stuff on the CD that goes along with this mini book. My first graders loved it!!
B007NZQU72|5.0|Very illuminating and confirming.  Since I can remember I have felt like a square peg in a round world.  This book highlighted and explained several topics that I already discerned; however, it also goes further to help a highly-sensitive person, like myself, accept one's sensitivity as valued.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|This app is now one of the largest on my phone, and the app doesn't allow you to move it to your SD card. Now I'm out of room on my phone, and I'm left with the choice of removing the app entirely or trying to find 10+ other apps to remove instead to make up this space.<br /><br />Other than this size issue, the app is great. I would probably give it 5 stars, but an app that's too big to fit is unusable.

B00637HXNG|5.0|I bought this BD for 2 reasons: to test my new 3D TV and 3D blue-ray player and because I love Scorpions.<br />After watching this disc I can say only: WOWWWWWWWW!!!!!!! x2 !!! Two times,because the 3D and because the concert.<br />This disc is the perfect showoff disc when you have 3D devices!!!! Unbelievable 3D quality,much better than most of 3D movies or animations.I couldn't move from couch for 2 hours,till the concert ended,I enjoyed every second of it and didn't get dizzy or headache from the 3D.<br />The concert,the music,the band,everything is perfect,this is a must have for any Scorpions fan!!!!! I am almost 40 now,i grove up with Scorpions,they were my favorite band when I was teenager ....now,25 years later this guys still ROCKS!!!!!!!<br />I would recommend this BD to everyone,unbelievable good concert and very good quality 3D.<br />Satisfaction guaranteed!!!
0743298039|5.0|Finished it in umder 24 hours as I could not put it down.  I was captive after the first page.  I RARELY rate a book 5 stars but this story was so fascinating and completely unpredictable.  Loved it!
B001TH16DI|4.0|The Star Trek 6 pack contains the first six movies, all with (more or less) Kirk, Spock, Scotty and Bones and the crew. The videos are in FABULOUS BluRay high definition/high density HD with Dolby TrueHD lossless 5.1 surround. My machine shows several of these movies process at 6 mb/S Dolby 7.1.<br /><br />My ONLY regret is that back in the late 70s and early 80s the only folks with big high powered subwoofers were a few thousand very wealthy people in Southern California and New York. The audio tracks, although they are pristine clean, are just a little weak, decibel wise, so you have to crank your system up even if you are running 1500 watts. Also the LFE subwoofer tracks are not full and lively like they are with most of the last ten or fifteen years' movies.<br /><br />The transfers are well done and Star Trek The Motion Picture is actually darn close to the Director's Cut, as opposed to that terrible hatchet job Robert Wise did when the studio gave him the final cut mere weeks before the premeir of the Movie in Hollywood. The Directors Cut was a fine version, plush with great scenes and panoramic perspectives that were just absent in the original release.<br /><br />Star Treks II, III and VI are outstanding in most every respect.<br />Audio, Video, effects, transfer, presentation.<br />I would give this pack 5 stars, but the shortage of perky audio forces me to give 4 stars for this excellent collection of greats. Every true Trek fan should have this in his/her collection.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I love this game. The characters and school remind me of Harry Potter and Hogwarts.  The only complaint I have is that you can't zoom in.  I am playing this game on a Kindle Fire and the smaller objects are hard to see.  Hidden object and mystery games are my favorites.
B0086700CM|4.0|Didn't think I'd like this game as much as I do but now I'm addicted!  Good way to spend extra time.
B0083GQKQG|2.0|This movie is very quirky and it has music that doesn't fit the plot. I don't like it. It was a waste of money. I don't recommend you wasting your money watching this movie.
B0083GPDBO|3.0|This film takes a while to get started and unfortunately the first 40 minutes or so are largely comprised of setting up generic high school characters and watching them behave the way that screenwriters in their 30s think high school students behave. The dialog is pretty risable and you can watch the first 30 minutes with the sound off and still know exactly what's happening.<br /><br />The three teenagers are: a misunderstood emo-type with a bad home life, a philosophical type who quotes texts, and a popular jock (also the token black guy and yes, he does get killed first). They're like, totally, you know like whoa in their dialog except for like the philosophical stuff that grates as badly as Rick Santorum at a Lady Gaga concert.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they opt for the \\"found footage\\" film model which almost never works even in the hands of people such as J J Abrams. This filming gimmick gets in the way of the story since every scene has to invent a reason why somebody is filming it. As a classic revenge-slash-superhero gone bad set-up, the use of \\"found footage\\" is Kryptonite to letting the plot and characters develop.<br /><br />On the plus side, the special effects are really excellent for a $12mm movie (filmed in South Africa, interestingly enough) - there are more visuals in the last 30 minutes than in most $200mm summer blockbusters. The best sequence is reminiscent of the Universal Orlando ride \\"The Amazing Adventures of Spiderman\\" and is really gripping to watch and easily the strongest part of the film. It's also the one area where the point-of-view shots work very well.<br /><br />Dane DeHaan is the best actor in the group as he slowly descends in craziness. Unfortunately he doesn't have much to work with since the film's dialog eventually becomes \\"I'm stronger than you!\\", \\"Don't make stop you!\\" and lines that you wouldn't see in speech bubbles in any respectable comic.<br /><br />This is a strong concept with great visuals but the generic characters and thin dialog ultimately let it down.and thin dialog ultimately let it down.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the worst book ever written. It is horribly written and not a book anyone should read. It is too erotic and it makes a person cringe. I didn't even get through the whole book because of how bad it is. This author should be ashamed to have written such a terrible novel. This book should be banned from all shelves. It is not meant for anyone's eyes, if this becomes a movie it will be rated X! There is no possible way to make it into a film. I wish I didn't purchase this book because of how bad it is. Think before you buy it because you will be sick reading this poor excuse for a trilogy...
B0086700CM|5.0|Good quality! Fast and accurate. This is a must have for a app collection...plus its free!! This is my favorite game!!
B00170MYIS|5.0|Please be warned that there are plenty of sellers selling knock-off batteries or China-sourced batteries that are often incompatible with US camera models. I made the mistake of trying to buy one of the cheaper versions of the battery and it would not work in my Sony DSC-HX9V. I would receive a \\"For use with compatible batteries only\\" message whenever I put in the camera.<br /><br />After getting my refund, I bought the more expensive version from Amazon (still much cheaper than buying directly from Sony) and it works great. The packaging was clearly for the US market and the battery is clearly genuine.<br /><br />I'd recommend you save yourself some aggravation and second-guessing and just buy from Amazon instead of one of the many resellers.
B006Q1SQCQ|4.0|Some useful strategies that will work provided that one is prepared to spend some time learning them and improving in applying them.
0553293397|5.0|Great book.  This is a murder mystery set far in the future.  A distant planet endures the first murder in its history.  On Earth, plainclothesman detective Elijah Baley is summoned to help solve the crime<br />  Once on the planet Solaria, he teams up with his partner from the prior book in the robot series, R Daneel Olivaw.  As they learn to maneuver Solaria, they uncover the alien culture and underlying social issues that drive one to murder.<br />  Although set in a very different future, Asimov again built a captivating story. More intriguing is his ability to develop these characters and make them believable.  He not only does this, but creates an entire history and culture of another world.  This world has far different social norms and laws than what we know.<br />  Asimov's ability to keep the reader's interest is excellent.  This book is a must read for both the Science Fiction reader and the reader of Murder Mysteries.  I do recommend reading the books of the Robot Series in sequence to understand the history and the characters.<br />  Enjoy!
B007EC27QM|4.0|The simplest calculator,  but does work wonderfully.  I use this application more often. The larger fonts make it accurate when using the. functions.

0345803493|4.0|I liked this book better than the first one.  I was told that there was more plot.  Which there is, but don't think there will be any less sexing it up.  It just gets more \\"involved.\\" At times, still repetitive like the first book.<br />A lot more is revealed about Christian, so we get to understand his character more.  This makes him more likeable in some ways.  We also learn the gravity of his emotional state.<br />I titled this internal conflict because we are reading it from Ana's point of view.  I actually felt conflicted about the whole relationship, which is what kept me reading.  Can he ever be \\"cured\\", does he even have a chance at having a normal relationship, could you ever trust him with a child, is he going to miss the stuff she can't handle??? We just don't know.  All Ana's insecurities are brought to life in the middle of the book.  At one point, it was so powerful I felt like I got punched in the gut.  But every good story has hope:)<br /><br />The ending of this book is great, so those who stopped reading missed out.<br /><br />If you read my other review I titled it Fifty Shades of Twilight.  This book veers from the plot of the Twilight series some, but we still see the over zealous Edward trying to get Bella to marry him, even though she knows it's too soon.  Yes everyone thinks she's pregnant too, or marrying him for money.  Then we have a psychotic Victoria charachter trying to kill her with a gun.  Christian continues to be controlling, for her \\"safety\\" and has his coven of security detail around her at all times.  Oh yes and we find his caning affliction is \\"cured\\" by her leaving him.  So, now her blood doesn't bother him anymore, after thinking she was dead for 24 hours.  Need I say more?
B0086700CM|5.0|It is addictive too though and besides the occasional lag, its super awesome and I'm glad kindles can finally get this game!!!!! I really do LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!
