B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've read and liked a couple of other books by Nicholas Sparks.  Therefore, I knew I'd like this one.  Wrong!  I LOVED it!  The suspense, romance, & finale exceeded all expectations!  I read it in 2 days which is the fastest I've ever been able to read a book!
B004SEUIWO|5.0|Great musical movie. And usually I do not like musicals. I watch it over and over again. It is one of my all time favorite.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|After a long wait for public release, I was glad to finally get it at a good price. Thank you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought this movie was soooooooooooooooo good!  Nicholas Sparks you did it again!  Also having Josh play Alex was superb(and not ad eye candy either!)  The movie has everything: laughter, tears and parts of went was suspenseful...all leading up to the EXCELLANT ending!  Need I say I want to adopt Lexi (Mimi Kennedy)
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Beautiful Darkness was a lot more fun to read, than the first one. A lot of twists and turns and surprises.  I'm really looking forward to reading the next book.  And I'm totally in love with Lucille Ball. (The cat)
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This was a very fun little story.  I have seen the movie probably a dozen times, and it was fun to see how the novel differed from the movie.<br /><br />One thing I thought was interesting is that the wicked witch is really just another adventure in a long journey.  The movie tries to make her the primary villain, but she's not that big of a deal in the book.  I can definitely see why the movie was changed to give the story arc a more clearly defined climax.  The book is more like a travelogue through a strange country, and ends somewhat abruptly.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is a fun travelogue, and I always enjoy books that show fantastic landscapes with fantastic creatures, and this book has plenty of that.  But it wasn't quite the story you would expect after watching the movie.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the rest of the series, particularly the ones that go beyond the movies I have seen.  I'm excited to see what other adventures await Dorothy.
1451627297|5.0|I have a read a few King books over the years, but absolutely none of them compare to this epic adventure.  I have re-read this book about a dozen times, and each time is just as awesome as the first.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I had mixed emotions about reading Sarah's Key because I thought it would be too sad but a friend recommended it, I thought why not!  Tatiana de Rosnay was so correct about the French aversion to Americans and their culture even if you have lived here for 30 years. It is so unspoken but it remains in the French psyche. I too am French but grew up in the States but I still am the American cousin.  The historical background was well documented and when I asked several French cousins about 'Vel d'Hiv' their response was was indifference to shame. Tatiana was correct as well about those awful days in 1942 when Jews where deported to death camps...such a sad yet unspeakable day in French history. Read the book; hopefully history does not repeat itself in this case.MNH
0226264211|5.0|Mr. Friedman writes with great knowledge on both the subjects of government types and economic systems. He lays out in great historical detail how a people wanting liberty and freedom do best politically and economically when a free market economy is the path by which most of what we need individually and as a society is met.
B003SI9WMS|5.0|One of the best Denzel Washington movies I have watched. Great plot, well acted, and seminal enough to keep me interested.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love the challenge! I sit and play games whenever I am in a waiting room and this one moves quickly so it is perfect.<br />I even have my grandkids playing this one which is great fun to watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 was very well done, even better than the 2 previous seasons! I highly recommend, but start with Seasons 1 and 2.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|What an amazing end to the greatest vampire series ever. It was a rollercoaster of emotions. Have read again and again! Wow!
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Great movie! Brought back many childhood memories! Characters from the Tintin stories came to life. this is a must watch for all Tintin fans.
B009HSUTB6|1.0|I am big Peter Gabriel fan and I was in high school when most of this was released.<br /><br />Which is why this was really a let down. The audio on this is terrible. Maybe not by 1984 standards, or by most cd standards.<br /><br />But remastered by today's digital audio standards, well it is terrible.<br /><br />Yeah, buy for Peter Gabriel and to have a complete collection of great music.<br /><br />But eventually you will wonder why? why such lousy audio.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|Awesome movie love it amazon kicked butt got it in 3 days and its got blue ray DVD and iTunes package recommend to anyone
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very entertaining. It portrayed the true conflict of the time and wasn't just a feel good happy ending.I recommend it

068484267X|5.0|I read review after review about \\"Angela's Ashes\\" saying that the book about Frank McCourt's life is not truth but mearly a well written, sad, fictional story. In fact even some people that grew up with Frank McCourt say it isn't true at all.  I did some research on Frank McCourt.  He grew up Irish and Catholic in Limerick Ireland.  I did too but not in Ireland. I grew up in Ohio.  However, I know there are things like abuse that are not talked about either in the church or in the community. I couldn't go to my priest or my teachers at school and tell them I was getting beat every other day.  Well yes, I suppose I literally could have but I doubt they would do anything back then.  Priests and nuns back in the day were really mean people. If you are not Catholic then you do not understand.  It was 35 years ago for me and perhaps now things are different.  Up until the 1990's people didn't care nor did the police or community leaders.  My step-father had the police called on him many times but either my mother would lie or most of the time the police did nothing. As far as I remember charges were never filed against him even after my brothers told the police of his abuse. Is it possible that a family can live a different life than the appearance other people see?  YES! I know. I lived it.<br /><br />The famous actor Richard Harris called Frank McCourt a liar.  They grew up in the same neighborhood. I BELIEVE FRANK. Why? My wife and I grew up in the same neighborhood, had the same friends and graduated from the same high school of 92 people.  Until we started dating 4 years ago she never knew anything that went on in my home.  It is amazing what people can hide if they want to. You see it all the time on the news. This couple has a hidden sex slave for years, or bodies buried in the back yard, or this abuse happened right under the nose of everyone else.  Is it that much of a stretch to believe Frank's story?<br /><br />In Frank's book \\"Angela's Ashes\\" he makes it a point to convey how embarrassing it was for his family to be the poorest of the poor.  Perhaps Frank did not get every fact correct and perhaps the movie did not represent the book well but let me leave you with something.  When children are ashamed of the worst most horrendous things in their life like abuse and poverty they are not going to step up on a soap box and tell you - especially if they are afraid of the consequences. I did not grow up very poor but I am catholic and Scottish/Irish and was abused and NO ONE knew except my close relatives.  There is also an argument that if you were very poor everyone else would know.  Sure today that might hold water but back then everyone had it bad.  Not even my closest friends knew how bad I had it. So, Frank, wherever you are, I believe you....RIP.

B002ZG999U|3.0|a good action movie that doesn't require a lot of thinking, if any.  i suppose having the huge cast of stars was a good thing in the end.  not too long or short.
0062238868|3.0|While this book does contain a lot of detail about Kyle's life, it is very light on details of his sniper shots.  Descriptions read similar to \\"I got a kill immediately.\\" and \\"I would get 2 or 3 or more per shift.\\" and \\"I got my 100th and 101st confirmed kills for that deployment.\\" This is almost certainly because every kill made has to be legally justified.  This is something I was unaware of.  Kyle does go into detail about how he was investigated for one of his kills as he was accused of shooting an unarmed citizen.  Kyle goes on to explain that every shot he makes may have \\"to be explained to the lawyers\\".  Further, that if he did kill the wrong person he could be charged with murder and be executed.  So I believe Kyle was intentionally light on the sniper shots because he did not want to write something that could be twisted and used against him in court.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|i really didn't know what to expect when i first saw this movie, but man did i like it.  well written, great special effects, funny.  i liked that it was supposed to be more 70's/80's era also.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Four years ago, a close friend gave me a copy of &#34;The Forgotten Garden&#34; and I loved every word. I did not however enjoy &#34;The Distant Hours&#34; or &#34;The Shifting Fog&#34; anywhere near as much. I was therefore initially hesitant to purchase a copy of  &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34; however  I am very glad that I did. I devoured it. It is right up there with &#34;The Forgotten Garden&#34;. It is clever and beautifully written. It was also nice to see the references to Mt Tamborine in this book. I grew up in Brisbane and know Mt Tamborine well. It's rainforests and rugged terrain could not be further removed from the England that Australian Kate predominantly writes of. My only criticism of her writing in general is that it is so English. Australia is a small market but we do need to see ourselves and our landscapes represented in literature.
B001H5X7JS|4.0|i thought that this movie was a little too ridiculous when i first saw it, but once i realized that it was sorta the point, i liked it.
1936608898|5.0|What I love most about this book is that it can hold it's own. It almost dares you to read it and challenge it's principals, research and refreshed paradigm. You'd be hard pressed to find anything negative about this book.  It's general feel when you read it, gives off true care and support; void of any pitches of big company ploys or hypocritical claims of which you could easily find in typical big company marketing. what Dallas and Melissa do is strip away the myths, the questions and the doubts and leave you knowing it makes sense.  A real \\"ah-ha\\" moment. This book is amazing and eye opening. All you have to do is read it to believe it. And that's the truth.
B0041KKYGU|3.0|i bought this dvd cause it was cheap and it was a funny enough movie.  diaz is always good eye candy in her movies.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's hard to put into words. These books bring a new meaning to survival. You have to do what's ever necessary. The end will surprise you.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|a great blend of comedy and action with a good cast of characters.  thought the length was just about perfect as well.
0553801473|5.0|The entire series of the Game of Thrones is great.  This book continues with the story and makes you want to read more.
B004HO6HWA|4.0|if you want pretty good action, then this movie works.  good movie overall.  jason statham is always great.  i liked the ending.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I'm am one of those people who like real animals not virtual ones but I really enjoy this games.it J's not just the normal care game it is much much more
1451613512|5.0|If you looking for the truth about todays world, must read this book. Much more complete than the showtime series. Amazing stories.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Woderful,exciting book by Niicholas<br />Sparks. Book is much better than the<br />movie,since the movie was altered.<br />Set in N.C. it is beautifully detailed.<br />A passatinate love story with an exciting extra kick. Couldn't put this book down . A Nicohlas Sparks fan.<br />Read it...you will love it....
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Read the book the day before I saw the movie. Had it finished in a few hours. Just couldn't put it down.
0553801473|5.0|I really loved the book.  I have recommended the works of Mr. Martin to all my friends..<br />I will be waiting for the next book of this series
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The movie came sooner then expected, My husband had been begging for it in 3D for the longest. I just couldn't see paying 35 dollars here at local stores for one.So for 22 buck and a short wait it was worth it. Since  my hubby is happy i happy..
1569242739|5.0|This is the best dessert cookbook you will ever buy.  It has all different kinds of cupcakes to make, you will never get bored with this book.  Personally, I make the Banana Split and Chocolate Oreo cupcakes for every party I attend.  Everyone cannot believe they are vegan and they always ask for the recipe.  There are no crazy ingredients to buy.  Every time I make cupcakes from this book they turn out perfect!  I recently made the Chocolate Oreo cupcakes into a double layer cake, that got rave reviews, the only thing I had to change was the baking time.  Seriously, this is the best dessert cookbook EVER!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Couldn't stop reading it! The author made me connect with the characters. I want to learn more about &#34;Industrial Schools&#34; now.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|The movie is great and all the technical stuff (picture quality, menus, etc.) is rock solid.  The only area where I was taken aback was with the special features - I was kinda hoping for more.  Once I was done with the featurettes my first thought was &#34;That's it?&#34;  It's not a bad thing, but if you're used to massive behind-the-scenes documentaries and interviews, etc., it's not there
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The details: Hills, turns that.. don't exactly look like turns, the mine, the dopey glidey thingies. It just amazes 'm e how you turn a fun, but kinds boring game into a fun fantastic thriller game. The running: fast and furious. LOVE THIS GAME
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Some people get way to critical about movies and give something like this way low ratings, and they're crazy.  This movie was very amusing and I was even able to get my husband to watch it.  Someone else mentioned that you'd like this movie if you like music, and I have to agree.  The movie did a good job at giving a nice mix of music from different generations.  All and all an enjoyable movie and worth watching.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game I have just started to play it and loved it so much that I had to leave feedback before I was finished
1616550414|5.0|This book is everything I ever wanted from Nintendo and Shigeru Miyamoto. The art work is amazing, the content was amazing. I just wish in the Chronologic order area that there was more information about Hyrule and its history. Always a great read about Link and Zelda.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I don't have much to say, just wanted this for my collection. It's a good movie, just the books are better.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I read many WWll books. This is one of the best.  You really get a feel of what the people lived through and what their world was like.  Never got this look at the war from such a vivid angle.  Couldn't put the book down.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I don't have much to say, just wanted this for my collection. It's a good movie, just the books are better.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Eben reveals underlying truths in the world's most revered books by presenting a responsible comparison of them as parables in which they all offer the same basic meaning. I appreciate the laborious research involved in producing this book, however in retrospect, I believe he could have told about the &#34;octaves within octaves&#34; without walking us through them and still made his point; I got bogged down in these parts of my reading. I read this on my Kindle and then ordered the book to have as reference.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|This is probably one of the best shows I've ever seen!! I started watching and could not stop!! cant wait to see the next 2 seasons!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book drew me in from the very beginning!  A great story about sexual abuse and the affects it can have on everyone involved.  A story with a great web!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. In the middle it tends to get a bit repetitive and slightly dragged out. Fear not, the story recovers itself and has an exciting and surprising twist.
B007THA4FI|4.0|slow getting started,but a good story of how one persons life can impact a whole town, both positive and negative.  Very interesting, and written in the English tongue and some english slang.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is so good I play it all the time on the kindle fire is  on the iPad brilliant game love it
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Another one of Mitch Albom's great reads!  This book really makes you think about life, death and the everafter.  An interesting ending!!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Yep, it's gory, but you will be totally sucked in. Excellent group of writers. An equally fantastic cast, although some don't have the opportunity to stay on as long as I may have liked them to. No job security for actors on this show.<br />It's the best ever but be prepared to have some nasty dreams.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another Nicholas Sparks winner!  A great love story with a lot of suspense and action.  Can't wait to see how the movie compares to the book!
140053271X|3.0|I have ordered my Nook from Amazon. First problem was the charging. Manuals told me to charge it for three and a half hours maximum. I could not use it for more then two days while it was charging continuously(!) from my computer.<br />It was annoying.<br />In the first two weeks I could not read anything, because of the lack of the wifi access.<br />It is funny in case of an ebook reader.<br />Then I had to add my email address and a valid bank account and other identifications. They needed too many personal data, before using the tool.<br />It is also funny in case of an ebook reader.<br />The PDF files that I copied to Nook  were not readable. I could recognise the titles only.<br />That was the third funny experiance.<br />Then after two weeks, while I left the Nook alone, I noticed that I have a new ebook and I could open the files, that I could not before.<br />Next funny thing. After using it normally for a few weeks, once tapping did not work. I charged it and it worked again. I thought that tapping does not work well, when the battery is flat.<br />Funny, but acceptable.<br />It used it for a few hours, and had the same problem at tapping. I even could not reach my files, because tapping needs for 'opening' the tools. No other way. If tapping does not work, you can not reach your ebooks, however there are some phisical buttom on the tool, also.<br />Funny and annoying.<br />Now the situation is : sometimes it does sense the tapping, sometimes doesn't.<br />Final annoying concern: spam mail per almost every day, about how to spend your money on ebooks and related things.<br /><br />Favourites beyond all negatives:<br />Nice , Light, Quick, Handle all kind of characters and signs (not just letters, but mathematical formulas also, and not just English letters, but other ones, also), Size of the letters can adjustable. Tapping - when works - can take paging very very easy.
B007PS0X0W|5.0|I loved this movie.  Kate Beckinsale is awesome!  They definitely picked the right person to play her character.  I love the action and special effects.
B00005CDUE|4.0|Bryan Ferry is best when he evolves, Some older tracks from Roxy are good, but by the time you reach Avalon in my opinion, you reach perfection.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Never would have guessed how much I would love this series! Sweeps you right along, from Scotland to Georgia, a truly delightful adventure.
B000KJTCOG|4.0|some tracks don't fit here, some are spot on, for the most part this is a steal of a deal, pick it up for the price.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I absolutely have had a blast playing this game.  Good stress relief when the alligators are biting.  Well worth the price.

B005NFW0U0|5.0|The Vampire Diaries is the best show on tv. I cant wait each week to watch it. This season was amazing.. cant wait to see what comes next.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|It saw Josh's usual level of quality! I think I have all of his albums and it was nice to have a new one to listen to.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show keeps getting better and better, although they have killed a lot of good characters I hope the ones that have made it this far stay alive! Season 3 is unpredictable and you do meet some new characters. I love it!
B008B0QH5S|3.0|I've been a Pet Shop Boys fan for many years and didn't feel that this lived up to their usual level of quality. It was more mellow than I prefer.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Always good acting and film with Denzel.<br />The airplane scene was insanely intense and enjoyed the film.  His addiction was quite depressing.
B001F4UHEE|5.0|Kevin and Annette slam it out of the park on this film.  A must see for anyone who is a Spacey fan!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is a great past time, absolutely brilliant game play and choice of class. Every level challenges both you and your character alike. I would highly recommend this game, with the choice of solo and multiplayer it attracts all types of gamers.
B00AJMQSP0|5.0|I purchased the single \\"Nabatea\\" from iTunes (after hearing it on Youtube) and then purchased the rest of the album based off this one single.  I do not regret it.  If you love power metal, if you love hard, melodic rock on a grand scale buy this album.
B005I6EU48|3.0|Name: Verso Prologue Case<br />Case Type: Sleeve / Book Cover style<br />How is the Kindle held in?: Elastic bands, four corners<br />Padding: Minmial - hard cardboard surrounded by very thin felt<br /><br />Notes: The Verso Prologue Case initially wins out because of the look. The leather-esque cover is very nicely embossed and looks very stylish. Unfortunately that's about all the good I can say about the cover. First off, your Kindle will be held in place by four very thin rubber bands (think hairband elastic - in fact, I think I own these hairbands...) in each corner - and it's not really a snug fit either. I was very weary of using this case without a tight grip on the whole thing. It really felt like the Kindle could just \\"wobble\\" out. Which runs into problem #2 - the inside of the case is covered by a very light felt/velvet type material. However there is almost zero padding behind the material, so it's like a fuzzy cardboard. So, take a Kindle that's shifting around as you carry it, plus a bare bones felt lining. I believe the Fire HD's use Gorilla Glass, but even so, I'd be worried about eventual scratches. The inner pocket is a nice touch, but it has zero give - so really the only thing that would fit inside would be very flat objects (business cards, notes, etc). I would suggest the Artist series for folks who put the Kindle into another bag of some sort. I wouldn't trust it as a \\"carry case\\" since it does not close by itself or have a security strap (another review mentioned magnets - mine has no magnets). It does look nice, however.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Enjoyed the character development, the plot, the premise.  A very enjoyable science fiction book.  Would recommend for all ages!!  A classic
B00138F080|3.0|Basically, all the tunes I had heard on XM or local radio, I absolutely loved, and is why I purchased.  I was hoping that after hearing the whole thing, there might be some additional gems.  While the whole album is decent, I cannot say that I have found any hidden gems.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I just couldn't get it to work after installing it from the CD. I have Windows 7 64 bit, so you can never tell what will work. The drivers installed quickly but I found that GPSinfo program would not work from the disk installation, so I went on line to GlobalSat and downloaded GPSinfo from the site and it worked like a charm.<br /><br />Tried it in 2003 Microsoft Streets and Trips and it worked flawlessly. Locked on to satellites from inside my home by a window very quickly. It is important to adjust the settings in two places, the Device Driver menu on the computer and on the map software or it will not work.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you can get past the installation.Street Atlas USA 2011 Plus
B00BESLT6G|3.0|This movie fell in the &#34;meh&#34; category due to the repeat nature of the events in the movie.  It looked like a Twilight version of the original.  I really liked the original.  The tone of that movie was set well with the way the mains isolation was setup, music and the creep factor.  This one had neither.  This had a feel like the father said &#34;hey, your mother did it so you have to do it too&#34;.
B007URVZJ6|1.0|Whole instruction is a total waste of time for someone who is familiar with computer languages.<br />One sentence instruction is sufficient: &#34;The Kindle format is restricted &#34;html - like&#34; format and text/headers need to be html compatible&#34;.<br /><br />If your book needs footnotes, or specific pagination, too bad, Kindle can't do it.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Excellence depiction of human weaknesses and how alcohol and drugs can ravish a person's personal and professional life. As always, Denzel gives an amazingly believable performance! A must see, but be prepared for a dose of realism.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book was a very pleasent story about a very nice man who lead a very lonely life.  I like how the story progress and like the ending.  Never read Christina McKenna before but I will look for her books.  Just a real pleasent read.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Gripping, exciting and smart - loved it! This was my first Harry Bosch novel and I will be reading them all.

B0044C3RB4|5.0|I didnt watch this show when this aired live but I've gotten into it because of the re-airing on Discovery Science channel. It's extremely good and easy to get sucked into!
B00865P3AS|5.0|This is the music I was waiting for all my life. The &#34;2 Cellos&#34; bring the music to the highest possible levels of pleasure. Their interpretations are original and fresh. I couldn't believe the beauty of the Police piece.<br />Highly recommended for every age group.
0345803485|1.0|Like many others I got the book because of the rave reviews by women who seemed to be like minded..maybe I just don't get it?!?? Ana the main character is redicilous and represented the type of person I want to slap. Christian Grey needs some serious counseling. I promised myself I would finish the first book, I've decided to call it a wash and donate it. Terrible terrible book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The story line was fast paced,suspenseful and well written. The ending was , while somewhat anticipated, was very skillfully written. I am  big Grisham fan; I was not disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love it. As I get into upper levels, makes me use my brain. :) I am glad that I found it on my kindle. I had seen a lady on an airplane playing it awhile ago.
B009IQG5LK|4.0|I saw Dick Tracy when first released on Video and now again on Blu Ray with a clearer picture and sound starring Warren Beatty as Dick Tracy a square jawed police detective wearing a yellow coat & hat armed with a talking wrist watch and tries to clean up the city streets of a crime wave headed by Alphonse \\"Big Boy Caprice ( Al Pacino ) and his gang of goons in the 1930's , Tracy also tries to live a normal life with girlfriend Tess Trueheart ( Gleann Headly ) and kid ( Charlie Korsmo ) an orphan boy Tracy saves from the streets who's always eating and things get worse when Big Boy decides to expand his operation with other villains and Tracy becomes tempted by lounge singer Breathless Mahoney ( Madonna ) and than things take a turn for the worse when Tracy is framed for a crime by a faceless figure and thrown in to jail .<br /><br />Cast : Many Patikin (88 Keys) - Dustin Hoffman ( Mumbless ) - William Forsythe ( Flattop ) - R.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was a very good story. It kept me wanting to go on at the end of each chapter so that I read it almost all in one sitting! The ending was surprising, the characters were very likeable, and the story was well told.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love playing this game and cant seem to put it down. totally addictive. I hope they keep tweaking and updating dragon story (:
B0026BD2GK|5.0|.....of the greatest moments on stage for this band.  This brought them into the &#34;limelight&#34; and the RnR Hall Of Fame.  This is a must!!!!!!!

B005VPRETE|5.0|Can't wait for our grand-daughters birthday so we can play with these.  She has out grown her larger blocks so it is time to move up to these. It is so fun to have &#34;girl&#34; specific legos, I am sure I will have the entire set!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was a great story that kept your attention from start to finish.  The subject matter is pretty deep, but it is very well written.  I finished the book in 2 days because I just couldn't put it down!
0786886811|5.0|I love Nigella Lawson's approach to baking. As someone who doesn't cook regularly, but has discovered a fondness for baking, I love this book! It's my go-to book for finding wonderfully tasty and easy to make recipes. For the most part, the recipes are simple and don't require unheard or rare items to make. Everything I have made from the book has gotten rave reviews! Thanks Nigella!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|After reading &#34;A Higher Call&#34;,  I found that old enemies are not only to become the best of friends, but are a part of something much more meaningful, a band of brothers.  War is the most trying of all human experiences, and it is good to find a book where you can go through the life stories of two guys who do their duty for their countries, and yet can become brothers in the end.  It gives one hope that our human existence is meaningful and worthwhile.<br /><br />Having a father who was a WWII decorated US Army veteran as well as a father-in-law from Spain who was a WWII decorated Wehrmach/German army veteran (Spanish Blue Division, Russian front), hearing them recall their stories together reminded me of the book.  Two different experiences woven into one bigger picture.<br /><br />The book is a journey not worth missing!!  Enjoy!!

B005OGYH90|1.0|Not the entire show! So disappointed. Only realized that when it arrived! Slash is really great, but I bought it because of the video!
B0000000LI|5.0|Bought one over 10 years ago and bought it one more time. Yanni's music is really amazing, espeically in this album The Rain Must Fall, and Within Attraction. Recording was professional and you can almost feel the live atmosphere.
0307476464|4.0|Take a trip back to 1984 Tokyo and you follow a young woman Aomame who is trying to make it only to discover a parallel existence call 1Q84, where the Q stands for question mark. You follow her narrative as equally Tengo an aspiring writer who is focus on his own life.<br />Aomame is constantly seeking adventure and sexual conquest as the lures men in her seducer style to love and conquer.<br />Even though this book close to 1000 pages, the narrative moves quickly and you can be engrossed in the crazy antics of the mid-1980s.<br />Crisp and detailed writing Murakami book is one heck of a wild ride.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Its interesting to see &#34;Richard Castle&#34;, as the firefly captain and looking much younger, but just as likeable as he is in the current series Castellated. This series was recommended by a friend and after viewing, i wish Firefly were more than 1season long.<br /><br />This very colorful outlaw crew travels thru the outer galaxy in a firefly cargo ship getting itself into many troublesome situations. What's nice is that all those colorful crew members are nice, ethical, and honorable people - except for one member and even he isn't a bad person, just not as honorable as the rest.<br /><br />Just as lot of good clean fun for sci if fans.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I love the idea. It's some sort of algorithm that presents your interests in a magazine form. However, I can't get Facebook to load into it and the tweets are not complete so you have to make a transition to Twitter to read the ones you are interested so it is a middleman app that doesn't complete the job. Fix these issues and you'll have a cool app
B006P96PAO|5.0|I like this movie and enjoy it. . .. . . . . . . . . . . .
B0052RDHTM|5.0|If you like historical novels, this book is phenominal. Additionally, if you want to know what citizens of other countries were thinking at the start of WW1 that made the conflict almost inevitble, this is the book for you. Ken Follett intertwines characters from all over the European and America into a riveting novel. I had trouble putting it down and immediately bought the second book in the series.
B00005N6KG|5.0|This is my second pair.  Love them the other pair lasted close to 10 years.  Stay on my head and in my ears even when running.
B0076HN3T0|5.0|Great video; mini doc. Grohl is the man, talented, witty, and can play the camera, a contemporary expressionist. No matter how you take it, he is the Boss of the new milllenium - tough on his band, works people to max their own talents. The heart strings are pulled as we journey thru Nirvana and some of the line up changes and ups and downs of the Foos. I really enjoyed learning more about Pat Smear as well. The music is incredible ~ only wish there were more music videos at the end of the video. A little surprise visitor near the end of the video as well, put a little tear in my eye. I didn't realize he was in it. Sweet.
B0053O89WY|5.0|How can it not be amazing! I own all 5 seasons now and watch them any time I need a good laugh.
B009LDXQGW|4.0|I was following this artist long before his single got popular.  I knew this album was going to be good.  Finally, R&B has some new talent.  Let's keep it real, the game has been GAWRRBAGE for a little bit after that wack album Soulchild put out and B. Jon flippin to doing upbeat, club type music.  That ain't R&B.  If these artists would bring it back to the realness, they would get four or five stars too.  Nevertheless, Trilogy is a very nice pickup for R&B listeners.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book so much I bought all 3 and have read them over and over wow I have no words it just that awesome
B004QX07G4|5.0|Just a great feel good read. It'll have you laugh out loud several times. Very funny and Ellen just has a way of making you like her.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great TV series! I had a marathon and couldn't stop until I watched it all. Would highly recommend for anyone
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I thought the cast did a phenomenal job, especially for singing while shooting the film, however, this album is lacking a few crucial pieces for it to be a true \\"highlight.\\"  \\"Do You Heart the People Sing?\\" is the most noticeable.
B0063GORYU|5.0|it is almost as good as playing the Pc version.  excellent game for aneroid and other tablets like kindle fire
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Be prepared to cry. And some uncomfortable first hand accounts of witnessing two teenagers losing their v cards. But beautiful
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Another great work by Nicolas Sparks that you somwhat know how it will turn out but as usual had some unexpected turns and hard to put down. An easy read and a great way to relax on vacation!
1423140605|5.0|I purchased this book for my 9 year old grand son and he read it in two days!  He said the writer is good and he enjoys the mythological aspect of it.  Sounds like a great book for young readers.
0345803493|5.0|The book was hot. I read the trilogy.  I didn't want an ending. I would read them again....very exciting. Did I say hot?
B00BESLHEA|2.0|It was an okay movie if you like action with no real depth of a story line. It could have done without some of the cheesy attempts at humor.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|All the songs are great, they have a good beat that keeps you wanting to listen. Thrift shop is the most popular and by far the best of the album
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Fresh new content every day. Great job Flipboard.<br />I am a photographer and check out the photography site every day. Also enjoy the news, technology and others as well.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|Some of the songs are outstanding, all are bluesy, and overall its a great album when you get it for less than $6.
B0035WTE2U|5.0|The product arrived quickly, which is rare for an overseas shipment, was the correct product, and has worked as advertised.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This is a terrific movie. I bought this a few years back and have watched it on a number of occasions, when I've gone through difficult times myself.  It is a wonderful reminder of just how lucky many of us are.  I have never suffered nor had to struggle in nearly the same capacity as Will Smith's character in this movie. Will Smith gives an outstanding performance in the true story of Chris Gardner, a bone density scanner salesman who struggles to make ends meet and is homeless, whilst trying to provide for his son, all whilst working hard (unpaid and with no promise of a job) in the hopes of one day becoming a stock broker. The story of how he gets into that is mind boggling enough. Life is a struggle at times for all of us. This is a must-have movie to have in everybody's collection, to cheer you, encourage you, to keep trying and most of all to have hope.
B000256TD0|5.0|Purchased as a gift which the recipient enjoys.  He has informed me that he has zero complaints and plans on buying the other models
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have the original Temple Run, and I had a blast with it. Then I downloaded the uber silly 'Brave'. But this one, with the new graphics and characters is even more fun. And the mine cars, when you can find them, adds a whole new 'element' to the game. Congratulations Imangi. Great job.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After all the hoopla over this series, I was majorly disappointed in this book. Yes, the sexual encounters were imaginative and titillating, but that was the only thing interesting in the book.  The characters were boring and stunted, and very, very predictable.<br />At the end of this book, I neither cared about these people, or even wondered where they would go next. I am not interested in reading any more of this series.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book for mature readers, maybe for younger women who do not know what real love is.
B001L63JC8|1.0|It starts with fly on a windshield. Half way through the song it stops and the next song starts. 5 songs not complete. Hopefully the whole songs are still in the cloud and i just had a bad signal while downloading to my phone. Ill give it a 5star as soon as i figure this out
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This movie has everything for the family plus some for the video game nostalgic adults. Completely worth it for the whole family!
0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a very well written and engaging tale of teenage survival that skillfully combines the Man vs. Society, Man vs. Man, Man vs. Nature and Boy meets Girl archetypes, but with a teenage girl protagonist. Set in a dystopian future where the population is kept in check through limited food supply, teenagers systematically are pit against each other in an outdoor arena where they must not only fight each other, but also hunt, gather and otherwise scavenge for food. Though I, and many others, were put off by the hype surrounding this book, I must admit that after having listened to it, I was well impressed. It is an excellent, if somewhat grim story that combines both social commentary and solid story telling elements into an engaging narrative that I would recommend for any age group old enough to cope with kids killing each other in gladiatorial combat.    For a full review, go to [...] or short link straight to the article at: [...]
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey's first season began things but the second season really improved on something that was great.  Looking forward to seeing the third season.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. It is a great app. I love pinning funny pica and some of the beauty and fashion links are really helpful. It would be better if you could filter some of the content ( like on the humor boards) but great app. fun and free.
B0063GORYU|5.0|After reading other reviews I was nervous about the ads, but I assume they stopped doing that.  Just one non-video ad pops up per game, but you can easily skip it.  Well worth it for a great free game.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I hope there's more to come :) the book was great! But I still have so many questions I want answered!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Well written book-I like the style of the author.  Unlike other serial writers, he does seem to enjoy what he is writing.  His books do not get old or stale.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|Melodrama that feels natural.  The characters and my interest in them only deepened, and the historical detail woven in makes it particularly interesting.
B002RMVAZ8|3.0|Second time is not a charm for this modern remaking of Shakespeare's longest extant play.  More cinematography, less integrity does not a perfected film make. What is lost in this interminable remaking is the sense of the Jacobean world in which is was created. The temporal shift does not improve our understanding of the topical nature of the events presented in this well coded theatre.  Branagh is well prepared, but at least 10 years too old for the role.  Ophelia is delightfully insane, but plays against a dumb wall of morbid incompetence in the other actors.  The Bard would puke.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|It's a fun family film with a simple story line. Entertaining for everyone. I will be watching again. Thank you.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is an awesome book has more motion than the other hunger games books it is awesome yeah incredible book THE Hunger Games
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I've always been a fan of ABBA's music.  I've seen the movie a number of times as well a two different live productions.  I prefer the movie version.  Although Pierce Brosnen can't sing, I truly enjoyed his performance as well as the other actors/actresses in the film - enough to buy the soundtrack.  Any fan of ABBA should be pleased.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It is an awesome book. I can't wait to read the last book of the hunger games it is awesome
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Watching this group of bad boys and girls is addictive. It is a Greek tragedy combined with comedy. Not for the faint of heart.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's fun for parents and its a nice mind game.and how fast your mind and brain works you can play with it on the road and at home. It's really addicting
1416972242|3.0|My Rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />An Overview of the Novel: Clary was determined not to get involved with the Shadowhunters, but that plan doesn't really plan out. When people discover Jace is Valentine's son, they stop approving of him and declare him a traitor.<br /><br />It's up to Clary to make sure Jace doesn't do anything rash. But that proves to be a little more than difficult. After all Jace is her brother, she can't love him. And yet she can't not love him.<br /><br />Clary is determined to help her mother too. Her mother is still in a coma and shows no sign of waking up. Plus, Valentine is out there wrecking havoc. But where do Jace's loyalties really lie? To the Shadowhunters or to their father?<br /><br />My Overall Thoughts/Impressions: I kept hearing that I needed to read this series from so many people that I finally decided to read the series. I read the first one in the series awhile ago and just barely got to this one.<br /><br />I will admit to being pleasantly surprised. I actually really enjoyed this one. It did feel like a little bit of a bridge novel; however, it successfully avoided the sophomore slump.<br /><br />I still really like Jace, but the idea of Clary and him still liking each other kind of creeped me out. That's partly why I didn't read this book, but I decided to read it anyway.<br /><br />I'm glad I did. I really enjoyed the novel and am pleasantly surprised by the Jace and Clary angle.<br /><br />I liked Simon a lot, but I just don't see him with Clary. I hope he does get a girl though.<br /><br />Basically, I did enjoy this one and am curious to read the next in the series. I have all sorts of guesses as to what happens next.<br /><br />So why 3.5 out of 5 stars? It was enjoyable, but it just lacked that extra something to really stand out in my mind. I did like it, however, and am excited to read the next one.<br /><br />In Summary: An original, compelling tale that has me intrigued to find out what will happen next. Definitely recommend to fans of paranormal fantasy (but then again, you have probably all already read this).<br /><br />The Wrap-up: Like I said, I can't wait to read the next one. I'm curious to see where this series goes. I really hope my suspicions are right and that I don't end up hating the series. :)<br /><br />Love,<br /><br />Danica Pageefinitely recommend to fans of paranormal fantasy (but then again, you have probably all already read this).<br /><br />The Wrap-up: Like I said, I can't wait to read the next one.

B00AAX68HG|4.0|Fun game. It's funny yet challenging. A lot of levels. And don't have to pay for anything you can just play. So if you like a free challenge then this will be a fun game for you.
B0015O1BT4|5.0|All the pages were there and it was in amazing condition when I got it.<br />I though it was going to all used and broken up. But it was a great buy.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesomely romantic book! I love how much they are both into each other. Very much looking forward to reading Fifty Shades Fried.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is a modern version of the Illyad by homer. its fun and exsiting how the story was updated now.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|I love Cubistry so I thought I'd try Cubimania. Big mistake. Where the user experience in Cubistry is superb, Cubistry's is awful. There are areas of the board you simply can't reach and the flow is very blocky and uneven. I played twice and deleted.
B0058YPILY|5.0|He and my daughter love the series.  I don't watch it. They have really enjoyed each season of it and look forward to the coming seasons.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Terrific story from start to finish. Loved the way the plot developed. Very surprising ending totally unexpected which made it even more wonderful.
B007JNR4WI|5.0|Great cast ; Travolta, Duvall, Whitaker, Sedgewick share a story about an unexpected gift which affects everyone involved.  It is uplifting, funny, clever and sad (without being depressing).  A movie which a family or just a couple can enjoy watching.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Finally, all the original Beatles releases are remastered and in one box set! The sound is incredible. The best listening experience I've had with my favorite band of all time. I have heard sounds that I've not heard before and with the digital remastering, it makes me appreciate all the more just how great these tracks were produced and recorded by George Martin and his two engineers Norman Smith and Geoff Emerick. The LP formats are the British releases and with the box set, you get videos on each LP on the CD's and an extra DVD disc has all the documentaries on one DVD to play in your DVD player. Well worth the admission price.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The game is fun but there are several issues I have with it--one has been mentioned here, which is it does crash if you play more than a couple of levels at a time (I have a Kindle Fire). I've been taking that as my cue that it's time to stop but as I like to play while watching TV it can be annoying. On a couple of the higher levels where the tiles were so small it just wasn't fun at all. I just didn't bother and moved on--if all the high levels are like this (I haven't finished all the games yet so not sure) that definitely cuts down on the levels I'll play but since it was free I can't complain too much about that. I do find it extremely annoying that the flowers and other vegetation images seem to match randomly rather than correctly like the other tiles--I seem to waste a lot of time trying to match those.<br />Since I'm being picky here I'll say I find the shuffle feature really slow and I've had issues with the 'hint' button, where it didn't give me a hint but when I pressed it again it counted the second (and once even third) try towards my 3 hints even though it had only given me one hint. As I said though the game is fun so I'll probably play until I've done all the levels I can see without straining my eyes!<br />NOTE: I have added a 4th star as I have tried several other Mahjong games since I wrote my review and, other than the freezing up, I liked this one the best. The other games did not have a shuffle feature and I much prefer to shuffle periodically than to have to restart the same level each time because I'm out of moves. (In fact, I sometimes use the shuffle even when there are moves left in order to keep more open tiles.)
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|Awesome r g . H y f r st t gift.  F. T.  G. G.  Th.  T.  Gift.  Uh huh.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I never played this game--as soon as I installed it I saw all the requirements it had to my data and immediately deleted it. What are they doing with all that info you give them while you're playing--creepy.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|This is a good book of the genre.  It seems to be closely related, in terms of plot devices, to the Harry Potter series, but it's far better written than the former.  Perhaps the writing is not as gripping in places, but it flows, and sometimes reaches heights that could be described as poetic.  In short, less original than HP but more gratifying to read.  It's possible that the 2nd book deviates from the HP story arc in significant ways.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I don't think there are a lot of great college movies out there (at least not lately), but if you enjoy musical performance you will like Pitch Perfect. It surpassed my expectations by a lot.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Lightweight, device snaps in place. Flexible cover holds in place with elastic either to cover screen or hold comfortably in the hand. Easy to use while charging, and cutouts at the speakers don't distort sound. And pink is pretty. :-)
B009RI4FRU|4.0|This film will live up to your expectations. It's a pre-teen love story but has all the usual quirks associated with his films.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This concludes Nolan's version of the legend beautifully. Story is consistent and comes full circle.<br /><br />Price was right (9.99) and shipping was timely. Thank you amazon!
B000SGSU58|5.0|As a former head of a criminal investigative division I absolutely love his character and can totally relate to him
B009CPES4I|5.0|It's just a nice movie, both funny and thought provoking. But then again, we're old folks here.  We'll watch it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so much fun! It plays smoothly and without glitches ever! I think that it is much better than temple run and temple run 2!  Definetely get this app!!!!!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|It is a great film. Denzel did an amazing job portraying a very sick alcoholic/addict who in the end found redemtion.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. You have to have a good strategy in order to be good at this game. I recommend this to anyone between 4-and older. This is a good game to play when your waiting for someone/something to happen.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|VERY INSPIRING AND THOUGHT PROVOKING.SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD READ TO SOMEONE WHO IS IN HOSPICE CARE.<br />SORRY THATS ALL I HAVE
B004FEL6GO|5.0|Great toy!  My son plays ruff with his stuff and after almost 4 months this toy is still holding up, and he's still playing with it daily!  Wish I would of bought him more of this set!  Great job Hasbro!
B008RYN44U|5.0|The first listen through wasn't what I expected, its a little more poppy than their older stuff, but the songs are now thoroughly stuck in my head! There's a good mix of slower, more intimate songs like &#34;easy&#34; and faster, rockier songs. Its great to dance to and a great album to pick you up. A brilliant album and return for No Doubt!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and does not require you to spend money on it to progress and have fun.  Plus the game has great graphics. For a free game you can't ask for much more....except more worlds and arenas to play. Hopefully they come out with another.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|It was ok to me ,i think it could of been better in my honest opinion...  im kinda glade i didn't go see it in the theater.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|I did not think this movie was &#34;thrilling&#34;.  The movie is basically about an alcholic and drug abuser and it is rather depressing.
B004G6009U|5.0|This movie is totally work buying and watching many times, especially if you have children. My husband adores this movie so its also great for adults too.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Ahhh finally something to explain why I feel the way I do.  And something that almost makes me proud to be that way.  I always knew I was an introvert but always thought that to be a personality undeveloped.  This book helps me understand myself, my kids, and now my grandchildren a lot better.  Wish I had read it when I was young.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love this book! As an adult young adult fiction is great and fast and exciting to read! love this series SO MUCH!

B0091REZMW|5.0|This game seems to be pretty interesting. I have played other games where things were much harder to find things. This games gives you a chance to move around the manor easier than having to remember which area to go to.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|This is one of the most gripping series I have enjoyed. Damian Lewis is wonderful in the role of the Army Sgt.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|very interesting story with an unusual plot. Her mind is in the abyss. I read the first book in 4 days,{ was hard to put it down} Reading only in the AM for 1 to 2 hours. Her second was also uplifting, I'm now on the third. Can't wait to read it to find out the answers I have to all the questions it brings out.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|People are just saying that Pitch Perfect is just Glee in college, this however is not true.<br />-Of course we see the similarities in this film. We see the gay couple, the girl with problems who wants the guy but doesn't want to admit it, and the fat and funny one. There are also some similarities in the competition such as the Warblers to the Treblemakers; both all-male groups. What Glee fails to cover, but Pitch Perfect demonstrates so very well, is the awkwardness of it all. We can all agree that Glee is pretty awkward but Glee isn't nearly as awkward as taking a shower and being told you can sing by a naked girl and her boyfriend.<br />-Another thing that differentiates Pitch Perfect from Glee is the reality and realness of it compared to Glee. Glee often shows members of the cast singing and walking through the halls with no one noticing whereas there isn't a moment of singing in Pitch Perfect that goes unnoticed. As you can see Pitch Perfect is no Glee.

1577314808|5.0|My wife and I had read this several times as a guide to personal growth.  We have been so pleased that we gave it to our son and would recommend it to anyone anyone looking for personal growth.  Allow time to become accustomed to the terminology.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|The movie is on the theatres from last week in Korea. I saw it and enjoyed very much and going more and more popular. It's not just simple romance movie. There's a stunning epiphany of life at the most crazy moment in the crazy world. I want to be the first to have blu-ray. So I pre-ordered. Wow.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|Need more colors...but a great case!! Protects my Kindle Fire. from damage. The elastic band  also holds my stylus so it always convenient for usage.
B000YDG6CY|4.0|These boots are already my fav shoe upon opening them! Really like the feel of the shoe. Extremely comfortable and gives a different feel than your standard boot. I get a lot of compliments for its look and believe me they feel as good as they appear.<br /><br />It is a bit larger in size than i expected so i ordered a size smaller just to make sure I wasn't swimming in my Tim's. I got that tip from reviewing other reviews so please take not.<br /><br />Pro<br />Price<br />Feel, quality<br /><br />Con<br />Nothing yet<br /><br />Definitely a must buy. Good shoe to wear at a dressy yet casual affair
B008CRC506|5.0|great show, loved the deleted scenes, highly recommend adding this to anyones dvd collection.  great entertainment and the musicality is just beyond words.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a fun easy read for anyone of any age.  It would make a great series for nightly reading as a family....turn off the tv and turn on your imaginations.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Awesome. Lots of action. Tom Cruise was excellent. The video didn't stop or skip and the audio synced up nicely.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|For all searches I start with Google, so this was an easy product to add. It is nice to have this available and not buried within sub menus on the Kindle. I probably didn't need to add this, I think I can change the default search to it.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I just loved this book from start to finish and l could not put it down for even a second
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is great for kids.If your child really wants a horse;they can have one but it will just be on a tablet.this app is free;even better!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Best book I have read in 2012 by far and have not read anything this exciting and involved since. Very , very good.
B0085W09ME|5.0|The app is easy to use and makes for a quick reference tool when searching for airfares.  It's quick and responsive.  I would recommend it for any traveler (leisure or business).
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the first book and the second one was just as good. I didn't expect it to go the way it did. I k n we katniss was \\"pregnant\\" but I thought she was for real pregnant. It had an wonderful twist at the end. I can't wait to read \\" Mockingjay\\"!!!!
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|I was instantly disappointed to see the image was flipped with this app. When going into the video function the app notifies me the camera has stopped.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Entertaining and engaging. Concentration and focus a necessity. Quite relaxing to play. One of the games I play on a daily basis.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a good story that was an easy, quick read with believable characters.  Problem with it was it had a weak ending which is not typical for Nicholas Sparks.
0425263908|4.0|Learned some new uses for the human body!  Not sure I'd want to try them though. However, am looking forward to the sequel(s).
030758836X|5.0|This one will keep you guessing until the very end. It's nothing short of brilliant the way the author pulls it all together in the end. A masterpiece.
0440245206|5.0|Loved this as I do most of Danielle Steel. Her stories are true to life and no foul or offensive language.
0525478817|4.0|Although the main characters are young adults who are facing cancer, John Green manages to give the reader an abundance of laughs. Very well-developed characters who deal with their illnesses through humor and by relying on each other.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|I've seen the series multiple times and its always good. I'm glad it's now on prime so I can watch episodes for free.
0385535147|4.0|Why should we be surprised that John Grisham has turned out another bestseller?  It is, after all, his trademark.  Gripping (but far-fetched) tale of patience, plotting, rewards and revenge.
B007885IJU|4.0|I already owned this on mp3 before buying this vinyl. Same great songs and the good vinyl sound. Only complaint is that the vinyl is a little thin.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I simply love this app. One of my favs. I a Realtor and I have to pdf many of my docs, so I am really happy with it
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I've seen the series multiple times and its always good. I'm glad it's now on prime so I can watch episodes for free.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I choose this movie because I like Richard Gere! The dog played an excellent role, he was great.<br />Family movie!!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love the whole three seasons, and can not wait until the fourth and fifth come out.  Waiting a whole year is awful.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Twist and turns, exciting, clever.  Big surprise near the end.  I loved it. Look forward to reading more of Gillian Flynn.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Hoping creator is looking...I had to change devices.  I'm now on kindle fire. Thought if I used same storm 8 I D I'd be able to access game in process.  Not so much!  Now I'm unable to uninstall, reinstall, and start over.  Gives me same game in process.  Now when friends gift gold or maps it goes to the old device.  I either want to start over on this device or have everything redirected to this one.  I tried selling everything on old device and then did uninstall.  Can you help?  GrammaDragon1
B009GEEMLY|5.0|What can I say, Im a geek! I loved this movie! its a must see. Way better than I even thought it would be!
B000063DHL|5.0|Seriously what can I say, Iron Maiden are simply one of my favorite metal bands ever. I've even had the pleasure of seeing them live down in Cadott at Rock Fest on their Maiden England North American Tour in July of last year, and they were just flat out amazing live, I felt my breath was literally taken away. These guys have always brought so much to their table other than just catchy, killer rock/metal anthems, they've brought sheer epicness, brilliantly complexed musicianship, and masterful songwriting and lyrics dealing with History, Literature, Mythology, War, Space, and Fantasy, and &#34;Somewhere in Time&#34; proves all of that. This album is truly one of Iron Maiden's best releases, it is simply a true juggernaut of a classic album in all seriousness. &#34;Somewhere in Time&#34; also introduces the use of guitar synthesizers as well, giving the album a strong progressive feel and atmosphere especially in the opening title track and &#34;Heaven Can Wait&#34;, and among other tracks on here. Everything that all fans of Maiden cherish and love is definitely all on here. Bruce Dickinson's vocals as always soar so high and mighty, and dueling guitarists Adrian Smith and Dave Murray both dazzle and delight with their incredible riffs and solos. Bassist Steve Harris as usual shines throughout with his incredible bass lines that are almost strong enough to crush your ribcage, and drummer Nicko McBrain shows his awesome talents behind the kit as always. Every song on here is a masterpiece, so there's really no skipping required here.<br /><br />The opening track &#34;Caught Somewhere in Time&#34; is an excellent fast 7 minute piece of pure Maiden Madness. The intro is just infectious and pure bliss. The second track &#34;Wasted Years&#34; is another one of Maiden's best known songs. This song is filled with more great riffs throughout including a killer opening riff, and the chorus is also very memorable, plus the solo section is just pure bliss as well. Track three &#34;Sea of Madness&#34; is no doubt the heaviest song on the album which is highlighted by dominating guitars, hard pounding drums and bass lines, and soaring vocals from Bruce especially in the chorus, while &#34;Heaven Can Wait&#34; is an excellent, catchy sing along number with a great bass intro, along with more amazing vocals and guitar work, and of course a catchy middle choral section that you just can't resist singing along to. Next, we have &#34;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&#34; which is another awesome fast galloper featuring fast hammering drum beats from Nicko. &#34;Stranger in a Strange Land&#34; is probably the album's best song in my opinion. The guitar solo always sends chills down my spine every time I hear it, just listen to it for yourself. &#34;Deja Vu&#34; is a great melodic, yet fast paced number, and of course &#34;Alexander the Great&#34; is an amazingly masterful 8 minute epic closer that will take your breath away. As I mentioned earlier, each song on here is a masterpiece, there is not one single bad song on here whatsoever.<br /><br />Overall, &#34;Somewhere in Time&#34; is another classic juggernaut of pure Maiden Madness from beginning to end. If you're already a fan of Iron Maiden, then by all means this masterpiece is definitely for you...<br /><br />UP THE IRONS!!!of Madness&#34; is no doubt the heaviest song on the album which is highlighted by dominating guitars, hard pounding drums and bass lines, and soaring vocals from Bruce especially in the chorus, while &#34;Heaven Can Wait&#34; is an excellent, catchy sing along number with a great bass intro, along with more amazing vocals and guitar work, and of course a catchy middle choral section that you just can't resist singing along to.

B004GXHOGK|5.0|I used this as part of a birthday cake decoration and my grandchildren loved it. The request was for a &#34;woodland scene&#34;.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Continuing the story was the main goal.  This is another quick read because you need to find out what happens next.
B000H6FE1M|5.0|Totally realistic-  my grandchildren loved the way these animals looked.  I used themj as part of a birthday cake decoration
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was thinking that this story would go a different direction.  But it was cleverly planned and again could not put it down.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I downloaded this to my kindle fire. I love that you can change card backs!! Don't like the ads that take so long to download and then close. I understand the need for ads but wish they were smaller.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put this book down. It was easy to read & kept you wanting to find out more about the characters.
0061733199|5.0|great book its a standard size easy to read font alot of great information. its a great book for a weekend camping trip or even if a natural disaster happens
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|I was amazed athow good this movie is. The graphics were great as well as the story line. Looking forward to the next movie.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|This was a great movie. Not sure if it was a true story or not but could easily be.  There was lots of adult content but otherwise a great watch.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This is simply the best photography book ever.<br /><br />Bryan is one of my favorites photographers, this book will tell you many tips and the photos of it are outstanding.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book so much and I can't wait to read the next book in this series. Peeta Lover!
B0083Z614S|5.0|This a story for children and adults.  There are so many lessons here. Hope, faith, friendship, loyalty, the ability to change for the better, all of it wrapped in a beautiful English garden.  The characters could not be more real.  I feel as though I would know them on site.  I would love to visit them and experience their healing happiness.  Will read this to my grandchildren.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun and affecting i play it all the time and I've fallen in love with this game
1401922732|5.0|I was excited to see the Archangel Michael oracle deck by Doreen Virtue. This deck is phenomenal and insightful 5 stars all around. The delivery was fast and in time, and I was thrilled to receive up to date tracking information.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|This is the season that first got me hooked on STTNG. Even years later having watched just about every episode ten times, I still enjoy the storytelling and great interaction between the actors.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Chose this for my bookclub to read. We all finished in a short amount of time. Will review next week with them, but I'm sure there will be all positives.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Richard Gere has never been one of my top choices but he is perfect for this role. His character's arrogance is perfectly setup for the big fall. One of my favorites.
0425252868|5.0|\\"A Higher Call\\" by Adam Makos is a fascinating story of two men who's lives become incredibly intertwinned in the skies over Europe during WWII. One doesn't have to be a WWII history buff or a history buff at all to be completely captivated and enthralled with this book from page one. By the end of the book, the reader feels a deep emotional connection to the two main characters. I would strongly recommend this book. JPettit
B00271B752|3.0|Hadn't watched this one in probably 15 years. Movie was a little slow but Pacino is amazing in this role. The technicolor process really gave this movie a realistic mood. It will probably be another length of time before i watch again.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|At 59 I've gone through a few input devices however this seems to be my best all-around mouse so far. While not a gamer primarily I find the Anker Laser Gaming Mouse to be extremely responsive, nicely programmable, but most importantly well balanced and comfortable (all weights installed) easily recognized by Alienware m18x r2 Win7 64bit.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Went off on a few tangents that were not necessary, but liked the character and it kept me glued to my seat.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I really like the Lee Child's Jack Reacher books, but this was the least likable of the many that I read.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Excellent read that I couldn't put down! This first time writer knows how to end a chapter so you must read the next one immediately! What terrible and difficult times in our American heritage!
B009738XXM|4.0|The beat is nice to dance with and listen. That is mainly what I can think off explaining the song.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This book puts everything you need to know in an easy understanding format! The insight that it has given on top of the marketing knowledge is priceless
0896898288|5.0|This is a quilting book my mother in law had not seen before.  It was a Christmas gift.  She liked it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can't believe a simple book consisting of 320pages could have me balling my eyes out clutching my duvet instead of packing for what should be the most life changing weekend but couldn't help it. I had to read more. I finally finished. I'm sad I finished actually. I wish it was more of an ending that left you knowing what happens to everyone. This must have been the feeling they always felt about the book they finally finished. It seems ironic that John green would put a writer in the story that did precisely what he did and leave us wondering why and yet I'm not mad or sad, I'm longing to know and I guess that's the great thing about this book, you will forever remember it as the book that made an impact. And yes while John green made a scar it is a scar that I many won't forget but I must say, I don't regret it at all
B00A4TKDKY|2.0|Oh, yes, he is fantastic guitar player, one of the most influential axe masters of his time, acclaimed and praised. No doubt, he is.<br /><br />On the other hand, notwithstanding oddity of the following words, obvious is Buddy Guy's gradual move off from the Blues quite craftily demonstrated throughout this album. Let's go song by song: spoken introduction is followed by Buddy's \\"Best Damn Fool\\", song with a great guitar solo but leaving listener with a feeling of imperfection. Something more is necessary both in terms of duration and emotion delivery. Next song, great Muddy Waters' \\"Mannish Boy\\", sounds less vigorous and ambitious than it should be; this song should be sung like an anthem `cause it is an anthem of Chicago Blues. Anyway, it goes as it goes followed by medley of \\"I Just Want To Make Love To You / Chicken Heads\\" which is turn to pure rock which, of course, is not prohibited but to some extent. Melody song \\"Skin Deep\\" is chased again by Buddy's own \\"Damn Right I Got The Blues\\", which we remember as great song and yet it is, considering brilliant guitar solo it includes. Then comes medley of John Lee Hooker's \\"Boom Boom\\" and Cream's \\"Strange Brew\\". I should take a breath. May I say that performance of a Blues classic, one of the most frequently recorded compositions in the history of Blues for just about half a minute, quietly, in a low tone, is a humiliation of the song? Yes, I can. Same superficial attitude is demonstrated towards next medley consisting of \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return) / Sunshine Of Your Love / Keep On Trickin'\\".<br /><br />Here set of Buddy Guy's live recordings finishes and starts three unreleased recordings from Living Proof: \\"Polka Dot Love\\", \\"Coming For You\\", and \\"Country Boy\\" which more or less create Blues ambient giving ground to optimistic critics say Buddy Guy is still in a Chicago mood.<br /><br />Not the best work of a master, not completely live. Not as enthusiastic as it could be. Not as Blues as it Should be. Perhaps that's the cost of prosperity and popularity. `Less Blues, more accolades,' might be a winning formula. Shame if this is correct. In general, the frightening trend is that some different music is called the Blues and new generations of music fans think Blues is what is sold as a Blues. Just look at Billboard Blues charts.<br /><br />I would extend the title of this album to include \\"Beyond The Blues\\".<br /><br />pastblues.comat's the cost of prosperity and popularity. `Less Blues, more accolades,' might be a winning formula.

B0058VW36U|4.0|Fun & easy for all ages.....Simple premise, easy goals to understand.  Cute cartoon character. Pleasing colors. Keeps you young at heart.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I like the story but this felt rushed and didn't seem to flow as well. Again the Kindle edition has a lot of missing spaces between words. Very annoying.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|This book successfully makes the case that we are all in sales. It's an easy read with lots of research to support his points. Importantly, it doesn't read like a research piece. Experienced sales people and those who think they don't sell will find this helpful.
B009P5K4HK|4.0|good en secured, i would have liked the one with the dictionairy. I like it anyway and listen to it with pleasure
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I won't comment on the quality of the book or even the translation, since I'm not qualified. The kindle version is free, the font is legible, and the story makes perfect sense. Enjoy it!
B0050SYS5A|5.0|i don't know about the other reviews,but with our experience,its totally awesome!!!just make sure you set it up right and its ideal for all spaces not just for small spaces..thanks again guys,love love luv it!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a fun game with excellent graphics. Great for any aged horse lover. Takes a little while to get more energy, but it's still great.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Definitely worth watching, once, however I wouldn't buy or rent it for a second viewing. Language was a little raw.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I would definitely recommend Bad Piggies!  My grandkids say it is a very &#34;fun&#34; game and I would definitely would recommend.
B004UPANGM|5.0|LOVE this movie...Bruce Campbell is awesome.  Sam Rami is a genius.  Elizabeth Leschender loves ham sandwiches though.  It's pretty scary.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I haven't played Angry Birds Star Wars but my grandkids have and they love it.  I would definitely recommend this one!
B003B02O3C|3.0|Not a great one from John. Many times the interesting court brawl is between judge and great benefit lawyer, not between Rudy and great benefit... A judge wy too much inclined towards plaintiff makes the whole story a bit dull...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It alright because i dont likenthe guy alway telling you what to do it fun training and competing but the guy say you have to feed it can he wait after the compete stuff
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Kindle Fire: I've tried a few general note-taking apps but haven't been able to find one that really suits me. This is by far the best one I've seen. You can keep several notebooks separately and each page within can be given its own title. It also has a lot of personal customization options as well. It is because of this app that I've begun using my kindle to take notes.
B000002H33|5.0|I think the development of a focused extreme metal scene (which would not exist without Metallica) has exposed some of this as less threatening as it might has seemed at the time of it's release (The Thing that Should Not Be - really?) and I skip \\"Orion\\" every time, instrumentals are boring.  But the musical onslaught is still impressive, and the 1-2 punch of \\"Battery\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\" has yet to be equaled.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful book! I was never bored! I will read it again after I read all his books! The movie was great too!!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Great product at a great price. Ir's free. It's easy to use and if you don't have protection for your phone, then try this for free. you will be happy you did.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was another one of several books by John Gresham that I have read that takes my breath away. The book had a good plot and details.  It was both funny at times and serious. The ending could have been more exciting however it was still good.
034580404X|4.0|I had heard a lot about 'Fifty Shades' so I was intrigued! I am happy to say that I wasn't let down. :) All the books kept my attention from beginning to end and u recommend them to everyone! So if you're thinking about buying these books, go ahead! You won't be disappointed!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I couldn't find season 3 on any other account. I looked on Netflix, Hulu, vudoo, and more and I found it here for an actually reasonable price!
0811875555|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! So many before and after concept art scenes, absolutely stunning fully colored pages, and process behind creations were shown in the book. Very well organized. The book arrived on time, and we loved it!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Another great Nicki Heat mystery. I couldn't put it down. lots of suspense, twists and turns. It keeps you wondering &#34;who dun it.&#34;
B003WJQ74E|4.0|Still an amazing read after all these years.  This is the book that &#34;Charley&#34; was based on.  As usual, the book is very good in comparison to the movie.<br /><br />It is a roller-coaster ride of emotion, as a mentally incapacitated man soars from an IQ around 50 to being an unmeasurable genius - and then back again.  Written in first-person in journal style, the work is moving, intense and thought provoking.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|game is a lot of fun. cant wait for some new ones to come out. this game is very chalenging.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|\\"Wool\\" by Hugh Howey is science fiction for easy consumption. That is not to say it isn't a riveting tome. Howey manages to construct one of the more compelling dystopian worlds of recent times with characters you come to care for. The omnibus is perhaps let down by the final act which appears to be rushed and somewhat inconsistent with the overall tone of the series. Still, an absorbing read from start to finish.
B0086213XW|4.0|It was a good movie, but ending could have been a little different.  I love Michelle Williams though in any movie.  It was a good story....feelings that happen to so many of us even in the BEST of marriages!!!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I choose this book because my mom reccamended it to me<br />I gave it 5 stars because it was very interesting<br />I would reccamend it to people who are interested in mysterious and kind of like fairytale books

B004NBY242|1.0|ive seen this movie on Netflix and really wanted a hard copy of it. however, the copy I received is from the UK, and I tried playing it on 3 different dvd players with no luck getting it to play. wrong region message appeared all three dvd players
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I misplaced the one that came with my Kindle, so really needed it. Thanks much for sending it so promptly!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Story starts out with a bang and then becomes very formulaic - plus there is no resolution at the end!  Left me feeling very unsatisfied.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|In all my 6 and 8 year old enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />They laughed at all the typical comedy puns.<br /><br />My wife and I thought it was okay.<br /><br />Sometimes I got the feel that Tim Burton tried too hard to deliver the obvious message about indifference and ignorance.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|I don't know what to say it was really good and I will survive the zombie apocalypse. The author is either crazy or a genius, most likely a healthy mix of both.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm not really sure why the world loves Downton Abbey but I do know that the cut PBS version is not as great as the real thing!
B005LAIHQS|3.0|If you're a MIB fan then you will, likely, enjoy watching this movie. However, I think the producers jumped the shark on this one. It DOES have several entertaining moments but it seemed to me that there was no real reason to make this film.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book has such promise, such suspense. You won't be able to put down the first 2/3's of it. Then the author seems to have lost her way, as if unable to figure out how to resolve the mysteries and conflicts she's set up. She throws in a new crazy person to imprison our villain in a glamorous McMansion, and I won't tell you how terribly she disappoints readers' expectations in her conclusion. I wish Ms. Flynn would give this book a second try, rewriting the final third.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is a top notch production all the way around. Everything is well done, and the Blu-ray andDVD look great! Seeing is believing.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm a big fan of Nicholas Sparks and I loved this book, that's why I felt it deserved five stars.  I considered this book a &#34;couldn't put down&#34; read and one of Mr. Sparks' best.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|One of the best records I've ever listened to and sounds amazing on vinyl. I have a cheap record player and it doesn't even matter. Justin Vernon has an amazing voice and a unique style, second to none
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book is very well written and has a surprise ending which I liked.  I would definitely recommend this read to my friends.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Just starting, want to get thru the hard part and into the better part.  I read it a long time ago and want to do it again. It came up on a kindle daily deal so reading it now a bit at a time, skimming/remembering the first part.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a very good book and reaffirms my belief in heaven.  Very easy read and believable.  I heartily recommend it to anyone who may have doubts about the afterlife.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|A wonderful psychological thriller that brings up the question of what was the cause for Kevin being a sociopath, his mother's apathy as a parent, or genetics? The movie will make you question what was the primary source of Kevin's emotional issues, as well as follows the unhealthy relationship of him and his mother. The movie is based off of a book which goes into detail on how Kevin's mother, while pregnant with him, was completely apathetic to the idea of being a parent, something that may or may not have affected how Kevin turned out. This movie is great, with acting from the talented Ezra Miller, and has a twisted ending.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|why this show got canned is a travesty. Anyone who loves science fiction would love this show and should watch it.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|I have been a die hard Mariah fan since Vision of Love came out in mid 1990. Since then I have followed her musical journey through ups and downs. I'm glad that Mariah has gotten back to her musical roots with \\"Almost Home\\". After last years tragic release \\"Triumphant (Get 'Em), I was a bit frightened that MC had lost her spark. But, within minutes of the first listen of \\"Almost Home\\" I got goose-bumps. Her vocals are as strong as ever, the lyrics are beautiful and very inspiring, and the slight electronic edge that the music has is a breath of fresh air for long term Mariah fans like myself. It is not an over sung song, just very melodic and straight to the point. The climax of the song is perfect, as it's something we've all come to love and respect from Mariah. So all the haters out there who say \\"Mariah can't sing anymore\\", take one listen to this and then promptly eat your words. Let's get on board LAMBS and make this her 19th #1 hit!
B001RXB4FY|5.0|I like every single song on this CD. I can hardly wait for the new one to come out! And I understand that they are recording at this time!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Very well written! Ron Perlman and the rest of the cast do an excellent job. It draws you into the world of the outlaw biker, and leads you to sympathize with characters that you would not think that you would. This is entertainment that puts you in the picture! I really enjoyed it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is just what I wanted and it is the only thing I play it is perfect I love it.
B000S88JTS|5.0|this film had a lot to do with me geting into moto cross great film i loved it just as much second time round
B007REV4YI|5.0|We Loved this movie.  It is a long and exciting movie.  Highly recommend it.  As usual, met our expectations.  Thank you.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|thoroughly enjoyed the book. provided great deal of information on WWII German airforce and their pilots that i did not know prior to reading book.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|We recommend this movie to EVERYONE in the family.  It is a great space age movie that is well done.  Loved everything about this movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The title of this book does not provide a spoiler.  Anyone deciding to read a book about kids and cancer should expect it to be sad.  But in addition to being sad, it is a great romance and a beautifully told story that will make you laugh and cry.<br /><br />The book is listed as a \\"teen book\\" which left me hesitant to purchase at first, but I decided to give it a try after reading the positive reviews.  Let me assure you it is not just for teens. The main characters are teens but it definitely holds interest for all ages.  As a parent, I related to Hazel and Augustus's parents.<br /><br />The book received some negativve reviews stating that characters were not realistic and depicted as being too mature for teenagers.  I disagree.  They are depicted as childrent forced to grow up quicly in the face of tragedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  I won't go in to depth with a description as that is the publisher's job.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS A FEEL GOOD MOVIE FOR EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY.  I had to shout it because I could not stop cheering for Wall-E through the whole movie.  If you want a family fun movie, Check out WALL-E.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a great book that you won't be able to put down! Highly recommended! This is the best Nicholas sparks book yet!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|We chose this movie because we wanted to finish the Batman collection.  It was OK, but a bit dark for my taste, but I do recommend this movie for the action.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a great book in the series!!! I can not wait for the next one. I love the books.
B000EMSU6A|5.0|Had this on vinyl when it was first released. Hearing it again after so many years is just wonderful. This is a rarely seen/heard (in my opinion) gentle, quasi-folky side of Pete Townshend, (and Ronnie Laine), with some very touching songs.<br />In particular, &#34;Nowhere to Run,&#34;, and &#34;Annie,&#34; both sung by Laine are true gems.
B00AJLHUA8|1.0|I love horror movies, but this has to be one of the worst films I've seen in ages.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that the producer, director and actors must all be writing their opinions of this movie on the sly to give it such high ratings on Amazon and other sites. The premise for the story was a good one, if someone had written a better script- unfortunately,they didn't.  Many scenes were obviously copied/stolen from other more successful movies in this genre. I feel this film had some of the worst acting, directing, editing, makeup and special effects I've ever seen.  The first half was so boring it almost put me to sleep, except for the fact that it was interspersed with frequent scenes of senseless, redundant and bloody family massacres all done in Super-8. It was sad and disgusting, but scary-no.  You know its a bad movie when you start rooting for villain, like I did, verbally encouraging him to kill off the protagonist and his family \\"particularly his whiny English wife\\" to get even with them for luring me into paying my hard earned money to rent such a crappy movie.
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|Streetwalkers deserve their very own Cinderella story. Julia Roberts is wonderful in this early role. You'll feel dorky watching it but enjoy every minute, and there's a valuable lesson about making your life count.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|It is light, witty, entertaining, romantic and funny. A light novel with character, and enjoyable characters. Plus the description of the island of Guernesey and its history is interesting.
B005CWRB44|5.0|Can't say enough about Fenix, or this little light. Not much bigger than the cr123 battery that feeds it, this little guy is a beauty. I'm getting another one. The quality of the manufacturing in this little gem is amazing. Took me a couple of minutes to figure out how to change the light settings, and it was simple as can be. Thank you Fenix.
B0027MJU00|1.0|Loved Gone Girl, but this was too dark and disturbing with characters that were hard to connect to at all. I ended up skipping to the last third of the book to just get it over with.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is the best book, but I haven't yet read the third book yet and I can't wait to read it.

B004CURZFC|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about this movie, but it turned out to be great! I loved it so much I've seen it twice! The graphics are top notch, and the story is engaging, even for an adult. I highly recommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box is another reason why I never miss a Michael Connelly book--especially if it includes the incomparable Harry Bosch.
B005MLP71Y|4.0|It was a good movie. An interesting movie. But I've seen better. The acting was fine, the animation, cute. It is worth seeing if you are a young audience, but definitely nothing to write home about. It wasn't boring.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another great King sci-fi classic. Time tunnels and what-if stories are a dime a dozen, but King weaves a thrilling tale based upon an alternate universe where the Kennedy assination has a different outcome.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|This movie will appease your appetite until Iron man 3 comes out. It was well done and if your a fan you will enjoy it. I didnt find it as entertaining as the Iron man movies however.
B009LRE040|5.0|Good story line. Christian Bale is a great actor. Hope that this movie continues on with it's story line. Bane was also scary! Tom Hardy rocks!
B00AY0A71I|5.0|Classic movie featuring Jamie lee Curtis, John Cleese and Kevin Kline in thier prime. This is one of the best classic 80's comedy that relies heavily on the 80's style british humour that was popular at the time. Normally not a fan of that style of humour, this is one of the best and more entertaining. I will watch it again.
B001G50SLE|5.0|Have watched every show, and will continue to do so. A great bunch of story lines here, that have us checking books, going on our fact finding missions, and investigating a tremendous amount of knowledge given in most all episodes. I really enjoy watching this show.
B003TGMFG4|4.0|Having read and very much enjoyed Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer, I was looking forward to reading Into the Wild, both of which I feel Krakauer was imminently qualified to write considering his extensive experience in the wilds and his notable skill as a author. Both stories left me with a heavy sense of sadness and more questions about the events than the books were able to provide. (I have not seen the movie Into The Wild) I don't feel this is due to any deficit on the author's part, but due more to the nature of both tragedies. Nothing is written in stone, everything is up to interpretation and in the case of Into the Wild, there are as many people that feel that what Chris McCandless did was reckless and foolhardy as there are people who believe he was a brave seeker of the truth, willing to die in his quest rather than live what he considered a half life.<br /><br />Most people reading reviews on this book are aware that it is written about a young man who disillusioned with his life, decides to shuck is all, leave his family and the comforts of the life he has known, to set out on a quest to live life to its fullest, in his own way and on his own terms. He hitchhikes across the country, hops trains, lives among hobos and vagrants, and embarks on dangerous and physically challenging adventures where he pits himself against everything nature can throw at him.  Along the way he stops long enough to earn his keep, make a few friends and then sets off on the next part of his journey. He's never sure exactly where he's going, he just knows he needs to get there. Sadly, the grand adventure for Christopher McCandless ends in an agonizing death, alone in an abandoned bus in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness. (I did not feel the need to indicate a spoiler alert here since the most widely known and compelling part of this story is the fact that he died such a horrific death) He was a paradox of actions and feeling.  How could such an intellectually gifted person make such stupid mistakes? How can a man who felt guilty for days for killing a moose in the wild, show little to no concern for the suffering he caused his family by breaking off all contact with them for two years, knowing how much they must be suffering, desperate for word of him?<br /><br />Into the Wild is an interesting, thought provoking and well written account of one young man's extraordinary journey of body, mind and soul.  Was he a fool to attempt it? Maybe. Was he naive to venture into such a harsh, unrelenting environment so ill prepared? Probably. Was his quest to find what he was seeking worth giving his life for? Those of us who read his story are left to ponder these questions and more with just one certainty... only Chris McCandless knows the answers.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Right off the bat, I miss Bobby! But the story lines are still as good as ever, and Jared and Jensen can't be topped for their true to life performances. Can't believe how close to this day and age this story line rides, which makes it all the more entertaining. The writters always come through on the story lines, it's clean enough for all ages and there isn't anything out there like it. Really like the moments of comedy too.<br /><br />Who would have thought of modern day heroes given everything else there is, I'm really glad someone did. And this is my favorite show.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Excellent story and well written. Gave me a new perspective and hard to put down. This author should keep on telling us stories.

B009FZFONO|5.0|Incredible moments packed with good acting that carry you through the emotional roller coaster rides. It's all about how the characters conduct themselves going through hardships and experiences that truely test our abilities and decisions for life. This show doesn't pull any punches, it's up and serious with it's story lines and adventure. If you don't find yourself in your seat thinking &#34;I would do this, or do that&#34; then you couldn't be paying close attention to the writters who are tempting us.  :)

0307950654|4.0|P.D James has done something different from her usual fare:<br />a mystery of sorts situated at Pemberley six years after the<br />wedding of Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennett.  Although some reviews have<br />been negative, I enjoyed the book, and think that a few lapses of<br />a nonagenarian author can be forgiven.  It begins with a slightly<br />revisionist synopsis of *Pride and Prejudice*, which hints that<br />Elizabeth may have been more calculating, and even predatory, than<br />usually imagined.<br /><br />  Throughout the book are embedded sly and unobtrusive<br />comments on P&P.  For example, early in the book:<br /><br />  \\"And she [Elizabeth] knew, too, that it was the birth of the<br />  two fine and healthy boys upstairs in the nursery --<br />  Fitzwilliam, who was nearly five, and Charles, who was just<br />  two -- which had been her final triumph, as assurance that<br />  the family and its heritage would endure to provide work for<br />  them and for their children and grandchildren and that there<br />  would continue to be Darcys at Pemberley.\\"<br /><br />This pinpoints what I consider a weakness of the P&P ending, which<br />describes the state of affairs some time (presumably at least<br />several years) after the wedding.  Austen makes no mention of<br />children -- either because their presence could be taken for<br />granted, or because there weren't any.  But if there weren't any,<br />the marriage would have been far from successful.  I think Austen<br />should have indicated, in a sentence or two, that Elizabeth had<br />had children, who converted Lady Catherine into a doting aunt.<br />Simple.  Neat.  Happy.<br /><br />  At one point a handsome young lawyer, a suitor for Darcy's<br />sister Georgiana, makes a feminist speech:<br /><br />  \\"Forgive me, sir, but I feel I must speak.  You discuss what<br />  Miss Darcy should do as if she were a child.  We have<br />  entered the nineteenth century; we do not need to be a<br />  disciple of Mrs. Wollstonecraft to feel that women should<br />  not be denied a voice in matters that concern them.  It is<br />  some centuries since we accepted that a woman has a soul.<br />  Is it not time that we accepted that she also has a mind?\\"<br /><br />I like it.  But would the first Mrs. Godwin have been called<br />*Mrs.* Wollstonecraft?<br /><br />  On the whole, I have not been an admirer of the P.D. James<br />mysteries, considering them too long, overly detailed, and too<br />much concerned with the psychological problems of the detective --<br />and also, I resented some mean remarks she had made about Agatha<br />Christie and Miss Marple.  But the present book, even if it could<br />have been pruned down, is a congenial read and a passably good<br />story.<br /><br />  What might Dame Agatha have produced for a P&P sequel?  She<br />might have added an extra murder or so and introduced some red<br />herrings.  There would have been sharp dialogue and real<br />detection, which is missing from James's novel.  I imagine that<br />Christie would have created a situation of total confusion, where<br />the characters had made a real mess and were running around in<br />circles.  Then Lady Catherine would arrive, begin interrogating<br />people, and get to the bottom of things.  With everybody<br />assembled, she would deliver a formidable exposure/denunciation<br />speech.  Justice would be served, and everything would end<br />happily, with at least one marriage.  But I digress.<br /><br />  Like all Knopf books, this one is handsomely produced.  The<br />editorial department deserves less credit, as there are outright<br />typos, as well as sentences that don't make sense -- and a firm<br />editorial hand could have improved the writing.  But I did enjoy<br />the book.  Go ahead, read it!
B003NFM3JK|5.0|And my neices about fell out of their chair at one point. Jim Carrey amazes us yet again, and I don't think they could have picked a better actor for this plot. Good movie for the holidays.
1452101248|5.0|If you're not put off by a recipe that calls for no less than three different kinds of soy sauce, and have a market nearby (or your own herb garden) where you can score obscure things like lovage, then buy this cookbook right away.<br /><br />These are not fast recipes, or easy recipes, or simply recipes, but they are amazingly delicious recipes. And yes, in many cases you can fake it if you have to. For example, the stellar Black Pepper Tofu still tastes amazing if you just you regular soy sauce instead of tracking down the three kinds the recipe calls for.<br /><br />We have yet to be underwhelmed by anything we've tried from this book.<br /><br />NOTE: In at least two recipes, this cookbook calls for puff pastry to be rolled out more than an inch thick. For example, in the Puy Lentil Galettes, one is advised to roll the pastry out to 1 1/4 inches. That's ridiculous. In both cases, it appears to be some sort of typo. Thus, if you haven't enough experience with puff pastry to know that they surely mean 1/4\\", not 1 1/4\\", be wary of such recipes in this book.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Very surprising how the story turned out in this movie. I would really like it if the story could have moved on to spend a little more time on some of the other characters in the movie. Wish there had been more time for that... But still all in all another good addition.
B00B2166BS|5.0|works great. Received it quickly.  Noticed that charging requires far less time.  Easy to connect with magnets and no complaints.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|As this series moves on it's even more exciting and loaded with adventures and mysteries that pull you into the brothers journey. I am a real fan of this series and look forward to even more. Great job!
B006TVQU6C|1.0|I got this one to replace my old computer case but it is a disaster.  When I received the box, I was happy with small size and light wight.  Once I opened it, the nightmare began:<br /><br />1. The case came with light weight because it made by some cheap metal, the real cheap one.  I would be so glad if it was made by aluminum; however, it wasn't.<br /><br />2. If you were the beginner to build your own computer, you should forget this one.  The whole case was built without proper measurement and design.  It required tons of DIY when you tried to put your stuffs in.<br /><br />3. The price looked tempting but you got what you paid for.  It only came with 2 120mm fans(1 on top and 1 at back).  You would need to spend at least $10+ more for aonther 120mm fan at front for smooth air flow.  Once you added couple cooling system in, the price was no longer good.<br /><br />I bought another case(cooler master CM 690 II advanced) for my new computer.  Comparing with this one, my cooler master case is supreme.  If you just wanted something cheap, tried something else cheaper.  If you really wanted something to build a high performance station, just left this one alone.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Great plot, good acting and loaded with surprises as the show moves on. I'm a serious John Carter fan, but this movie was definately getting up  there. My neices really liked it and still enjoy watching this movie since the first time.
B00499K9E0|5.0|I am a big Sherlock Holmes fan. I was a little wary going into the show, putting Sherlock Holmes and Watson into current-day situations, but I was instantly hooked. I forget the number of times that I have watched it. I recommend it to everyone I talk to. The writing was fantastic, Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss are geniuses. The acting was even more amazing. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are my perfect Holmes and Watson. I couldn't asked for anything better.
B00005JO20|2.0|Why did we get this? Okay, the giant-pet idea was kinda cute, but - the dinosaur waterfall? Really? REALLY? Oig.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love The Piano Guys. Just listening to their music makes me really happy. They take songs you already know and love and make them even more amazing. I like some of their arrangements better than the original song. You know these guys are pros because they make playing these instruments look so easy. There isn't one song on this CD I don't like.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is amazing it is a lot like temple run. it is a great game for every one grime kids to adults.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|For many years I've had trouble staying asleep at night.  I find some of the background noises on &#34;White Noise&#34; such as the &#34;Amazon Rain Forest&#34; more effective than medication in helping me to maintain a good night's sleep.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Love Pac-Man....hated this app.  Maybe if I could have played a little more I would have gotten the hang of it and liked enough to purchase the full version but the world will never know.  If you want to convince people to buy....let them play just a little longer.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I heard so many bad things I waited till I was done to review game. works great on my Fire. No problems through the whole game. looking forward to #3
B005LLSNNE|5.0|It is possible that I am obsessed with the Sons of Anarchy.  I never watched the show on television because I thought it a bit &#34;rough&#34; looking but happened to catch an episode one night and was intrigued.  It just so happened that I had passed over the free streaming of SOA on my Kindle through Prime so I decided to give it a try.  Hey, it was free! What did I have to lose? Started at Season 1, was immediately hooked and am now halfway through season 5 which I purchased because I couldn't help myself! My husband I watch almost every night and love, love, love the show.  It's not just an adrenaline rush, there are human and very emotional elements as well. The lives (and deaths) of the characters and how they evolve keep me interested.  It is easy to become involved in the lives of these fictional characters.  There are the ones I love and those I hate.  I laugh because the dark humor is subtle but superb.  I cry because I can't help it.  Yes, it is possible that I am obsessed....just ask my husband! Can't wait for Season 6...this time I'll be watching!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This conclusion could not have been better in my opinion. I was riveted the entire time and the ending was fitting though I did not see it coming. That's part of how I know a book has captured me intensely because I am so into it that I'm reading as fast as I can, giving no thought, no speculation as to what lies ahead. I just run at break-neck speed to get there.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|Ordered two for some friends. The badges look great, perfectly as described, and I LOVE the little boxes they came in. Very happy with this purchase :]
B009DH379C|5.0|More than i expected, it´s really a must for a Queen fan. Image and sound are really good and the bonus let you see Freddie from another point of view.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Knowing nothing about these horrible things going on inside of north Korea,I feel responsible for being ignorant of these atrocities. They were going on right above the country I was born in. I hope this book will move more people to take action and help those people find freedom. It sure changed the way I look at north Korea.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|Never Let Me Go calls into question everything from where we get our food, from animals to the migrant workers who pick our vegetables, to the people who cook and clean for us, all those unseen people who make our life convenient. This film just ups the ante by introducing the concept of organ donors and elects to focus on them to the exclusion of the other 'real world'. This is very important to understand. One of the constant, and rather mindless, criticisms of this film was the 'ol why don't they just run away' routine. Simply put, if this society is technologically advanced enough to have this donor program it would stand to reason they would be adept at using microchip or DNA tracking ability. At various times we see the donors check in with their bracelets, we can assume they have an ability to easily track the whereabouts of these valuable donors. In addition, we have fairly recent history to show us the answer to this silly critique. No rational, intelligent people apply this 'run away' trope to European Jews ethnically cleansed in the Holocaust. Nor Bosnia, the Killing Fields of Cambodia, Indonesia, the Kulaks in the Soviet Union and ad infinitum. Just read a few history books and one will discover all the sociological, historical, and behavioral reasons these things happen that I don't have time to elucidate here.<br /><br />As to why exactly this film didn't find the audience it so richly deserved, it's very difficult to say. There are precedents though. The film that most quickly comes to mind is Hitchcock's masterpiece Vertigo. It landed with a resounding thud when it came out, but in decades since has inched itself into the number one greatest film ever made just nudging out Citizen Kane in the most recent comprehensive critics poll. What probably plagued Vertigo is probably at work here as well. Compared to his prior thrillers like: Rear Window, Dial M for Murder, The Trouble with Harry, and The Man Who Knew too Much, Vertigo wasn't the same kind of plot driven thriller. It plays more like a slow burn psychological study dissecting the male psyche a la Bergman's Hour of the Wolf or Bresson's Diary of A Country Priest hidden in the guise of a Hitchcock thriller. After all, two thirds into the film is the 'reveal', Vertigo is much more than that however. It just took that long for audiences to catch up with the subtly and brilliance of the film. A similar dynamic is at work with Never Let Me Go, people seem to be concerned with petty plot points that really aren't at all pertinent to what this film is all about.<br /><br />One need look no further than Mark Romanek's first film, One Hour Photo, to conclude he's a Kubrick fan. Many of the slow zoom shots on Robin Williams reminiscent of Barry Lyndon and especially The Shining. While I thought the film was very well done, nothing in it indicated the utter brilliant, mastery of the medium Romanek puts on display here. Obviously, coming from the world of commercials and music videos, one would expect a well shot, well edited and designed, technically proficient film. However, this is the work of a fully mature artist. The sensibility, sensitivity, and aesthetic choices here are perfect across the board. Clearly, the subject matter would indicate a technically advanced, futuristic society, but rather than fall into the usual sci-fi visual cues Romanek opts for a radically different approach. This is an alternate reality, focus on reality. If it were set in the typical dystopian future, the viewer could just easily dismiss it as, &#34;oh well, that's way in the future.&#34; Instead, this is here and now. This looks like a reality we know and understand, a world WE live in. This makes it all the more unsettling. As mentioned, every aspect of the film contains impeccable craftsman ship: script, performances, cinematography, production design, editing, and maybe most importantly the score. Rachel Portman's music maybe be the best film composition since Bernard Herrman's score for Vertigo. I'm usually resistant to a score that tyrannizes the narrative, guiding us through what to feel and think. Simply, most film scores of the last few decades. For instance, in a film like Michael Mann's The Insider, much of the score is overbearing, hampering the power of what's on screen. In another Mann masterpiece, Manhunter, some of the Shreikback songs impossibly date the film to the Eighties. Never Let Me Go is a completely different animal. It does what all great film scores do, it compliments the visual experience, enhances it, imbues itself in the film's DNA so you can't possibly imagine the film without it. And, that's exactly what we have here.<br /><br />I do believe we are looking at future Vertigo in Never Let Me Go. In my mind, it's easily one of the best films I've seen in the last few decades. It is my sincerest hope that those serious about Cinema will give this film a second look. Just a ripple out in the vast ocean, but sometimes that's how the most powerful movements begin: from the heart! It's a film that's challenging, difficult, emotionally resonant. It makes us ask questions about our very existence, our very humanity. Isn't that what great art is all about?
B00992CF6W|5.0|The way the pocket edition works is fantastic highly recomened that you get it. It is close to the xbox.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Many \\"management\\" books come and go but this one is different. Written as a \\"novel\\" instead of a \\"guide\\" this is a genuinely interesting story of a fictional company and their path from typical IT madness to success. Along the way you learn about having IT Security (my particular field) become part of the SOLUTION instead of part of the perceived problem.<br /><br />I've read (or been forced to read) many a \\"flavor of the month\\" management guides, both IT specific and general business oriented, but this one hit home. If you don't see you own situations in at least one, if not several of the sub-plots in this book, you haven't been in the business long enough. The fantastic thing is their business model for selling this book is to release the entire first half as a free PDF. Within 30 minutes of starting it I was off to Amazon to purchase and load up the E-Book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I already saw the movie! although I knew it was not going to be the same, it made me read the book all over again.  Tension, anger and romance all in one but the ending...that's the best past.  I highly recommend it because it has a little bit of what life is all about a&#34;rollercoaster&#34; of fear,romance, love and relationships, the good and the bad..........
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I don't want to say this this is for all files and considering how cheep this is it would be at least a safe bet.  however i do have to say that the cord and the mic themselves were very choppy and they had shorts all through them when i removed them from the package.<br /><br />Also the clip wouldn't even fit mic correctly.  i tried to slide it and snap it into all the best places i could and it didn't seem to fit.  when i looked for a picture to see where it went, i tried to put it on that way and the plastic snapped!!!<br /><br />i would rate it a one for cheap product with not much reliability at all, however given its price you could have some luck -shrug-
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|This is a great book, sad in a way but it shows that life can take different paths and that one wrong decision can change your story.  He thought he was making her a favor, however happiness was not what they attained by it, especially him.  I recommend it highly although it is not a &#34;happily ever after&#34;
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This is the 2nd book by Sparks that has left me a bit bored and I cannot understand the over developed characters that should be placed on main character development. Not only does this leave me little care or concern for them, all that wasted space could perhaps develop a real storyline. Perhaps it's the male perspective that throws me off since I know women, if truly honest, would be offended or at least very hurt by some of the dialogue both verbal and non interaction. So very bored. No more of his books for me.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I absolutely love this game! The graphics are awesome, the fighting moves are amazing, it's got a better gameplay than most games and I love how they show the days Bruce was underground in cartoon
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Another Masterpiece from Rush.Still lean more toward the Concept Lp 2112 for me,but it grows on you with repeat listening.
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|Ok, lot's of gore, but most people who watch these types of 'chainsaw' movies are immune to it.  Film does a great job mocking this genre, along with the 'crazy mountain people' and the 'naive and spoiled college kids'.  You do come to expect one laugh out loud scene after the next, and the film doesn't disappoint in this regard.

B0060MYM7O|1.0|There's a lot of people out there having issues with these Bluray sets. A lot of people have missing discs, others (like myself) have all the discs, but the Blurays won't play. In my set it's disc 3 that won't play. Excellent show, but this is a place to rate these specific sets and my opinion is if you're thinking of buying them, wait... there's too many problems with them now. EDIT: It seems my disc 5 won't play either. Discs 1 ,2 and 4 play fine, discs 3 and 5 don't play at all. New Sony Bluray playerwith the latest firmware updates and still won;t play those specific discs.
B009FZZK8I|4.0|What a great look into the craft of film special effects. Just watch this and appreciate the hell out of this show!
074322454X|5.0|Ashamed to admit that I came to this book backwards.  I rented one of the DVD discs of the HBO Miniseries BAND OF BROTHERS, and was hooked.  I bought the Miniseries on DVD.  I wanted more.  I bought the book it was based on.<br /><br />I have no clue how Stephen does the extensive research and gets insiders to open up and spill all the tiny secrets that makes a book like BAND OF BROTHERS shine and thrill me.  This non-fiction book reads better than most fiction books I’ve read; Ambrose not only digs to find the facts, he makes them sing; and then dance; and then slide up to me and whisper into my ear…<br /><br />Yes, I am something of a WWII buff.  Now, I have Churchill’s six books on The Second World War, and I’ve slogged through parts of those books; although the “winner” is framing the tale here, I trust Winston when I want to hunt down a particular fact or get his take on some incident.  (I actually prefer the fictionalized Minority Report of WWII presented by German General Armin von Roon in Herman Wouk’s WINDS OF WAR and WAR AND REMEMBRANCE; added bonus: the presentation of the Battle of Midway in REMEMBRANCE, which is the clearest explanation of that naval battle I’ve read, and sometimes brings tears to my eyes.)<br /><br />If suddenly my kindle will only download Stephen E. Ambrose books, I can probably live with that for a long while, because looking at the list of the other books he has written I can see more than ten books that interest me just by their title and the fact that Ambrose wrote them.<br /><br />BAND OF BROTHERS is about a Company of “Airborne” soldiers, starting in basic training until beyond VE Day.  Is the HBO thing better, or is the book better?  Don’t know.  I’ve read the book 3+ times, watched the DVDs 7+ times.  They are both great; but without the Stephen E. Ambrose book, the HBO thingie would not exist.  @hg47

This book brought a kind comfort in the thought that she might be able to see me as I grew up and see my children and my children`s children. this is a moving, thought provoking piece of fiction.

1400069289|4.0|I read it about a chapter a week. The stories were memorable and well told. The last chapter is a little dark, but sheds light on current issues. I think I'd need to reread it in order to learn more from it.  It doesn't lead the way into self exploration. If that was the intent, I needed it to connect the dots for me.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I -rarely- take the time to write reviews. However, I felt compelled to do so, in this case. This album is such a breath of fresh air. There is not a single sub-par track on it. Furthermore, every track seems to grow on you with each playthrough of the album. The band's sound and style are unique and defy being pigeon-holed. They most certainly don't \\"taste like chicken.\\" Brittany's voice will make you smile and tap your toe on one track and simply tear at your soul in the next. My own personal collection includes everything from Schubert & Vivaldi to Megadeth & The Ramones. Somehow, this album fits \\"perfectly\\" into that. Click and enjoy. You will thank yourself later.
1451695195|3.0|It is an Okey Book to read but shows uncertainty of the author as of existence of Heaven and don't seem real because the way it is written.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Enjoy it and sing along.  Other than their big hits Flapper Girl will stay with you.  the Big Parade reminds of the word phases of early Dylan.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|I'm a history buff, so I thought it was fascinating. I could see how it might be too boring for people who are not particularly interested in history.
B007REV4YI|5.0|There's a reason why this franchise ran for 50 years, and there's a reason why it'll probably run a good deal longer yet.  Since Daniel Craig took the role, and since Cubby Broccoli (sp) left us, the emphasis on stupid gadgets, invisible cars and demonic villains with bases inside hollowed out volcanoes has gone.  What we're going back to is closer, much closer, to Ian Fleming's original version of Bond - an only child, orphaned, misogynistic, hemmed in psychopath.<br />There's a few surprises in store for you if you didn't see this at the movies, but the plot probably is the final &#34;transitional&#34; film from the old Bond back towards the original.  Highly recommended.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I have seen this play at least 7 times in the city I live in. Seeing it reproduced after being in production for 25 years, gives me goosebumps every time! I cry every time I watch it!

0811870413|5.0|I've been making the &#34;Country Bread&#34; from this book every week for months now. It is amazing. It took quite a few tries to get comfortable with dough this wet, but it was totally worth it. It also took some experimenting to get the timing to work with my schedule. I've settled on making the working culture in the morning before work, making the dough and shaping it into loaves in the evening, letting the loaves rise overnight in a cool place and then waking up early and baking before work. I've bought a second combo cooker so I can bake two loaves at once and that helps quite a bit. The basic country bread from which all other recipes in the book are based is so good I've hardly made any of the other breads. I still think this book is worth buying even if you only ever read the first recipe, which is 70 pages long, and perfect making that bread. It is so tasty that I've spoiled myself and my fiancé for other breads.
B0052FDL6I|5.0|It's a superb album, and would deserve 5 stars. However, the digital download of \\"Suicide Machine\\" has a mixing error in it 2x (listen to the voice). That's a real shame.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|This book was great. I devoured it over a week long vacation and loved every minute of it. The future the book is set in is incredibly bleak and very interesting at the same time. This book really got me thinking about what life would be like if civilization as we know it collapsed and we were left living in the ruins. This book had me interested all the way through and the ending was both surprising and satisfying. I had already read and enjoyed Pump Six, so I went from The Windup Girl directly to Ship Breaker and enjoyed that book quite a bit as well.
B000063UR1|5.0|I  watched this movie over 30 years ago and had  forgotten its  title.  I  never  saw  it  again but always  had  to think of  3  pictures:  the  scene  at the beginning when Bruce Dern  eats  his  muesli and his  fellows laugh  about him,  the  scene when he  instructs  the robots  to take care  of the plants  and  the last  picture  which shows  a  little  lightspot somewhere in the  darkness of  space  with the robot  watering the plants.<br /><br />Finally  I  was able  to  find the  title by  going  through  lists  of  science fiction movies on the internet.  I will order the DVD and  I am quite excited to see it  again  after such a long time.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Funny read. Felt like she was right there telling you these stories instead of reading them. I just love her POSITIVE attitude and her attitude to &#34;be kind to others&#34;. I highly recommend this lighthearted read to lift your mood!

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a well written story about a man who suffered pain and sorrow, and finally love and acceptance. The characters were vividly described so well, that they seemed to step right off the page. Well done, Ms McKenna.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved it. Can't wait till the third book. June is too long to wait. I thought I loved 50 Shades. This is actually more realistic. Both characters are messed up in the head because of there past. Which leads to the characters both doing desperate acts and fighting through the whole book. Also like they have different nationalities its more realistic.
0061733199|5.0|Upon first review I am very impressed by this book. The detail and amount of information it contains seems to be more than any normal individual would require, which is great!!!

B001UTW7QU|5.0|Each episode addresses a new technological possibility with subtle allusions to an underlying mystery concerning one of the major characters possible historical involvement in the current events.  Thus, it will keep you thinking.  There are a few notable events which fly in the face of current medical facts, etc. but not so much that it keeps the story from being a good one.  This is one of my most favorite shows since I finished the much more light-hearted Eureka series.

B008CJ0KBU|5.0|I recieved this product in swift action. Lost girl is a great tv show i just love it. I will be ordering the rest of them soon.
1558908382|5.0|everything should see this.  wonderfully diverse soundtrack, always in play in on form or another in my home....ok yes buy
B004EK91LQ|4.0|Loved this one as much as the first two. Great dancing and good plot. Hope they make more and keep the story going
B007C3TVNA|3.0|The movie was OK. I find the disjointed flashback-present-flashback format confusing.<br /><br />The most unrealistic thing is the way the townspeople treated the mother with such venomous hatred. There have been plenty of mass school killings here in the U.S., and I never heard or read of parents being persecuted.<br /><br />After every movie, I ask myself, \\"what are the redeeming points of this movie?\\". The only one I could think of was, when Kevin was talking to his mother (in jail) about \\"that people wouldn't be watching him (on TV) if he got a straight A grade in geometry\\". In other words, media and public consciousness fixates on violence with a voyeuristic quality. That was an important point
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Not what I expected and was leary to rent, but got a big surprise with the outcome. It is a must see if you like vampire movies
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I'll admit up front that I am a throwback to the 60's and 70's and that Kenny Loggins has always been one of my favorite artists.  This CD is so refreshing.  There is a true, heartfelt experience behind each of these songs.  How refreshing to have something that isn't full of crude language, talk about killing cops, etc.  I had the pleasure of hearing them live just after the CD was released and they sound just as good live as they do on the CD.  You can tell that a lot of work went into the final product.  I have been waiting patiently for someone to release some music that is as good as the &#34;good old days&#34; when music was real, and my wait is over.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Not what I expected. Thsi is not just another singing movie. This one has class and will surpise you with the ending.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This product is exactly as described.  Each disk has the Original Theatrical edition and the Special edition on it.  This is a great buy for the Aliens lover!
B0098VXE50|5.0|Not a great movie for Kristen. She will always be Bella and this is no different. Good plot and the characters are great, but Bella is Bella
B009FZFONO|4.0|When you stop to think about it for too long, you realize the premise is pretty cheesy, but it's a fun watch...so don't stop to think too long -- just enjoy.
098555780X|4.0|It has some good information and different items to make, I like the instruction pictures. Good for a beginner and more.
0441020712|2.0|This is basically a very long short story based a single uninteresting and overworked idea about man's initial steps towards interstellar travel.  The characters are not compelling, there is a complete lack of dramatic tension and the resolution is like air deflating from a balloon thats been left out too long.  Im a big fan of his other books and so slogged through this one but it really read like a short story he had written in college that he stretched out to fill a novel length after gaining some fame.  Hopefully this is just a single side step and he will get back to the imaginative and capitaving writing of Revelation Space.  Would be sad if this is the first in a GRR Martinesque slide into irrelevance.
B005LAII62|5.0|I dont see why people dont like this movie, it was well done, acting was good, plot development was good, the stop motion was amazing, still trying to figure out why people keep saying this is pushing the gay agenda, there was a 5 second mention of Mitch's sexuality, and i guess some people think Normans gay too but what ever, its a good movie, yes there is some language but nothing more than you would hear from kids if you were at a school. So for anyone who wants to see a good movie check out Paranoman, I actually bought the book after seeing the movie, just as good if not better.
B005HEDI3K|4.0|Great product and free with Amazon Prime.  Sometimes it does seem like the stream interrupts because of busy-ness at Amazon'ser server...
B0058VW36U|5.0|this game is great because it makes you think throughout each level and season and I just love it so much.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My children wanted to download this and I am glad they did.  It is a lot of fun for all ages.  Even my 12 & 11-year-old sons have fun making silly hairdos and faces.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Nice app it does help me to sleep and easy to work with. Recomend to anyone to has problems sleeping.
B001N4RORE|5.0|this movie just puts me in a happy place.i laughed,cried,laughed again.this will be one i watch over and over.i rented it so many times from our local movie rental,figured i might as well just buy it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I had been using my cell phone as my alarm clock forever.  However as soon as I got my kindle I wanted to have one put on there.  It works brilliantly.  And I can almost use it as a desktop clock because of the case I have for it.  The clock face is displayed while you are in the application so I can now just look over and see what time it is.  It also tells you what the weather is.  Nice feature because I generally have my blinds pulled and unless it is super sunny I don't know what kind of weather I will see until I finally get out of bed.  It also allows you to play music on a timer.  This is nice because I may just want to drift off with music but don't want it to play all night long as it may disrupt when my boyfriend comes to bed.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|my kids and i were having a looking back moment and watched this movie.this was one of many favorite movies in our home.it was a great memory.thank you for making it available,now it will be my grandkids turn to watch.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Could not put it down, fantastic read if you enjoyed \\"The Dome\\" you will enjoy this ... Jake is back
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end. Those traits make it worth five stars to me.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|So this is a good read about teenage angst. The ending is sad but over all I like that it closed the book.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It gave me a lot to think about life and how little things just don't matter. Enjoy every minute you have.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome Trilogy....Couldn't put it down. I loved the Authors writing technique. She is one talented person. Still reading for the Millionth time.....
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Continues on with the first season excellent storyline and acting. It drew me in all over again, got my wife hooked on it as well!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I played it on my friend  phone the like 6 months later I finally found it now I can't stop playing it. This is like temple run except you don't tilt it you only swipe. AWESOME GAME EVER!!
B001GXTXTO|4.0|This was recorded in a basement, and has the feel of music right from the soul. The songs will stick in your head!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Having the Bible close at hand gives more opportunity to read the &#34;good news&#34; at any time! Additional program plans to encourage daily reading helps keep my faith on track in this life filled with deception.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|No fillers, some great blues rock. Lyrics leave alot to be desired, usually just a couple phrases repeated over and over in a snarl that's hard to understand. But hey, it's blues...lol
B0063IH60K|4.0|Program brings back memories of early days of playing solitaire to learn mouse functions. Now it is a tap of the finger to play this classic game. It is addicting!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This was such a great and entertaining movie with a message for older folks to keep on going no matter what.  All of the characters faced adversity and most overcame them and found new lives they had never dreamed of.  I had seen it in the theater and just had to have my own copy which I will look at every now and then.  Nice to see movies made for older adults and not just kid stuff and blood and guts shoot um ups.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I purchased this book because it has been on the best seller list week after week.  I find it very entertaining but not a spellbinder.
B00AA7V2Z0|4.0|I'm not a fan of horror movies but this is a great show.  You really need to pay attention but after the first 3-4 episodes its much easier to understand whats going on.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Watched this Oscar-nominated doc the other night.  It was fantastic - a great story and beautifully shot.  Would recommend it to anyone.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I had been looking for a program like this for a long time. Sometimes you want to take videos with you.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|It just was not as good as the first two.  The middle was a drag to me. Plain and simple.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I love the blu ray version of the nightmare before Christmas, it was an amazing movie from the beginning to the end. And it's come with two DVDs one blu-ray and the other one regular.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is for all the classic disney fairy tale lovers... with an allowance that they will twist the stories just a bit! After the first season I was hooked and it is a great series to get into since it just keeps getting better!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Although the concept is very simple - the game becomes quite challenging as the levels increase.  Highly recommended for those who like puzzles.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I realize that this is a classic and that so many people just love it.  I find myself wanting to smack some sense into the main female character.  It is dark and depressing with an ending that is a slight preservation of justice.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|With the update to version 4 - this has become my favorite virtual keyboard . . . much better than the stock one that comes with android.  It has built-in predictive text that learns based on your typing, and they offer really good support.
B004UID2LC|4.0|It works well with our Kindles.  My kids love it, they drive me nuts with their downloads in the car when we do not have Wi-Fi, but it definitely works as billed!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Started a little slow but the development of the Kevin character started to spice things up.  A combination of romance, psychiatry, social problems, suspense, drama and finally spirituality.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love the wide variety of White Noise sounds.  My husband even likes it so much he took my Kindle, because it didn't seem to work well on his Blackberry.  The wave sounds and fire sounds are among my favorites.
B0030B621W|5.0|How is it that I didn't see this moving until just a couple of weeks ago?? Absolutely beautifully done. At first you think you know where this is going, the typical sci-fi one man in space against machine and then there's this amazing twist that really brings this film to the next level. I laughed, I cried, it was way better than Cats. ; ) Seriously, well worth the watch.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is my go to application for reading and downloading on line documents.  It works very well on my Kindle Fire.
B0095P29EG|2.0|Poor story, good special effects. I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone. No wonder it;s free. Hopefully your free stuff is better quality
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|As usual my kids love Angry Bird apps.  This app is all about building contraptions to conquer a set course.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Love it. His skills as a guitarist are awesome especially blues riffs. I would buy all his stuff. Would like to see him live
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My kids like Angry Birds.  This is like the original Angry Birds with neat backgrounds and new levels.  Fun for everyone who likes Angry Birds.
B00684J49U|5.0|brand new jsut like it said it would be, came in great condintion and has held up its part of the the deal.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This works very well, with plenty of annoying sounds to wake you up.  Our personal favorite is the Rooster...it sounds like a rooster on meth.
B004RE29PO|5.0|Weaver is the bomb and the cast is incredible in this one especially Bill Paxton.  The best of the three and way ahead of its time again.  Many great one liners and tons of action throughout.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My kids adore this app like all of the other angry bird apps.  This one deals more with gravitational pull within the orbits of larger bodies rather than standard gravity.  Enjoy!
1400049628|3.0|Good book but not as good as WWZ.  If you are a zombie fan you will be entertained.  The bits about different zombie timeline encounters was fun but almost too redundant in some cases.  Great precursor to WWZ though and you will like it if you are a zombie fan.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My kids love Angry Birds.  It is a fairly simple game and enjoyed by many. It is free, it works well on my Kindle, I have no complaints at all.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I so related to Cheryl's adventure! I would love to hike the Pacific Crest Trail! Love it!  She is a very gifted writer!  Don't miss it!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is possibly the best Bible application ever.  It allows me to make notes, highlight, switch between versions effortlessly and it will even read the passages aloud to me!  Excellent work whoever created this!
0738727326|5.0|Card booklet isnt like most Ive seen. No reversals noted, which I like- any negative end to a card is built into the imagery, and I find I dont use the booklet at all as I either found the written meanings useless, or the meanings were already obvious in the card-art. While this all sounds negative, these are things that I actually like about this deck. I prefer to read off only the card itself, and this deck seems perfectly suited to just that. A greater challenge than just reading out of a little book. Love this deck, some of the images are truly breathtaking- such as the nine of swords. Just wow.<br />Imagery is very, very detailed, so if youre into simpler imagery, I cant recommend this deck. But, I love these cards.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game ever!I have built a huge maze in the sky you can do so much especially if you have the more minecraftstyle house idea book!
B007SGM084|4.0|I thought the first two books were amazing. I thought book three was long and could have had a way better ending. It was crazy jumping all around, then ending like that. It made me really dislike the third book. But I would definitely read another book by this author.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I can continue to play this game and it remains fun and challenging.  I recommend it for anyone who likes to fill in some spare time but not too much
B009IQG5LK|5.0|Loved this movie back in it's release day. Couldn't be happier to finally own this on bluray. A great addition to my collection.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|It does give a perspective of a small irish town and their inhabitants - which can be a bit depressing but I found it to be well-written
B001EN71HC|5.0|Love the Austin Powers movies. This is a great collection to own. Great to have on bluray. Hopefully the make more cause you can never get enough of Austin Danger Powers.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Genius of George R.R. Martin.  Bet he was a bit of a pain when putting written word to a screenplay.  Follows the book closely.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|great movie! nuff said. I was really really bored and wanted something to do so this looked like a good option. glad i watched it, should have bought it tho,... the part where the plane was crashing was scary to me, made me feel like i was about to crash and die with them lol.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Grandbaby loved it.  Grandma loved it also.  Will Ferrell is great as the &#34;evil&#34; Megamind.  Tina Fey, great.  A lot of adult references to keep me awake.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I didnt think It was the best bond movie, but it was well done. It had lots of action and it was entertaining.
B004G600A4|5.0|Once again alot of adult references to keep the Grandma awake.  Story easy for 3 year old to follow.  Recommend for any little girl.
B009C7JS14|4.0|very cool. my kids love to open and look at all the different stuff. it keeps them occupied and they learn about humidity and stuff affects the daily weather. I like that it shows me everything on one page!
059306688X|5.0|Hugh Dan Brown fan.  Ironically, lost my copy and found another at Amazon.<br />Used copies a miracle for the organizationally challenged.
1439102813|5.0|From this book I learned compassion for those suffering from memory disorders from both the caregivers perspective and the patient's perspective.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book, it was thought provoking and philosophical.  It made me feel for to the main character and his struggles he was going through.  Interesting read.
0425252868|5.0|One of the best books I have read in years.  Even though it is based on biographical events, it flows like fiction.  A true lesson in history about WWII air warfare.  I won't be surprised if this becomes a movie in the near future.
1401324649|5.0|I totally loved this book! I laughed out loud repeatedly while reading it. It is just fantastic. Allan is the Forrest Gump of Europe. He participated in many major political events and met Presidents Truman, and Nixon, Stalin, Churchill, Mao, Franco, and de Gaulle among others. The book tells the story of his escape from a nursing home at age 100 and the adventures he has which include millions of dollars of stolen money in a suitcase, a hot dog seller, several professional thieves, being chased by the police and the bad guys, and an unfortunate incident of one of the bad guys undergoing death by elephant. The story is interspersed with Allan's memories of his hundred years of living and his stints in prison, expertise in explosives, dinners with prominent politicians and of course, his love for vodka. Totally one of my favorite books!
0812979656|5.0|I don't know what else to say.  I've read many novels and many were stellar.  This might really be the best I've ever encountered.  Perfectly realized, start-to-finish.
B0025VLEM0|5.0|Love this movie, glad I finally bought it on Blu-Ray. Watched it a ton since I've gotten it, 'twas a great purchase.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I play this on my Kindle Fire with my daughter.  We've had a lot of fun with it.  Can't go wrong for free.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Cruel and Viscious Murders are committed in small town locations.  Detective Larkin is known for his experience, but when informed he has a new female partner Jesse he has doubts with her abilities.  The killer puts a price tag on his victims because they have wasted time in society.  At first he hides his identity and is in control of his psychopathic ways.  Chemistry and trust begin to build between the two detectives.  Time Killer has several characters you begin to feel their horrific deaths.  Author Todd M Thiede keeps you turning the pages.  If you enjoy well written murder mysteries take the time to read this one.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|More than I expected. Any Wagner lover would enjoy this music and especially Jonas voice. One of the greatest Wagner's interpreter today, without any doubt. Everyone should be able to listen to this voice.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Cant live without it!<br />Its my daily bread! The truth! The greatest book I ever read.and my kids love it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|it was a very fast and enjoyable read.  I couldn't put the book down.  Can't wait to see the movie.  very enjoyable.
0425252868|5.0|Fantastic story and very well written!  It was hard to put the book down!  My only question is: When are they going to make this into a movie!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like that you can change horses.  I like giving my horse treats.  I enjoy training and caring for him.  I am six years old and I am glad my mom let me get this app!
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Comes awfully close to uncontrolled self-adulation for a singular accomplishment (265 confirmed kills, or so) that is, to me, less than a full-throated virtue.
B000EQHHJW|5.0|With the best voices available and the historic Italian settings, this film truly does justice to Verdi's magnificent work. Even our new-to-opera friends loved it!
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|There is a simpleness to this album that feels raw and real -- like the very bluesy opening track, Don't Look Twice, and I Ride At Dawn -- but some tracks have a more driving beat, Blues with a heavy dose of Rock -- like the tracks I Don't Believe A Word You Say and Blood Side Out. A fantastic mix -- a fantastic album!
B006R1T40I|4.0|How can you go wrong with another Bonnie Raitt CD? I don't like it as well as some of her others but I'm glad I bought it.
B003UESJHO|5.0|Love the story of Mickey and Dickey! and Christian and Mark put it beautifully! Such a great cast! Fight scenes are intense.. but Mark Wahlberg shirtless and sweaty the majority of the movie is enough for me! :)
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is a wonderful concert and it arrived in excellent condition for a great price. I recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it.
B003PGNBNY|5.0|Ever since I saw the first one, I have always wished that Camp Rock was real so that I could go! Love this movie! A must have for any JoBro and/or Demi fan!
B002SRQ214|5.0|This briefly went down to 85 dollars and I couldn't pass it up. I swapped out my old 545 dual core chip with this one and it added .8 to my Windows performance score. Simple to overclock. I have a Corsair H100 cooling unit, so all I did was adjust the CPU multiplier to 19 instead of 17 and voila, 3.8 GHz with no other changes. The default voltage is 1.45V which is kind of high compared to the 1090T chip (which I also have), but that's what allowed me to get to 3.8 GHz without any other changes. I plan to push it to 4.0GHz which will most likely require additional voltage, but should be attainable. Paired with my GTX 480 video card, I am able to run all my games at the highest settings.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00004ZELJ|5.0|I have this on VHS and I was so excited when I finally got it on DVD! So when i watched it for the first time in years I felt like I was 13 again!! I think i got the same reaction i did back then! AJ's solo is a must see.. for ANYBODY!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought that temple run was great and now the 2nd is even better!!!!  With great graphics that can be adjusted and characters and power ups definitely get this game!
078322933X|5.0|Must have for all Mark Wahlberg fans.. his creepiness is pretty sexy! One of my favorite movies!! The part with the dog made me super sad but I still loved the movie!! Must have!!
B000067FP8|5.0|I laughed my butt off!. It was stupid but vey funny! Bought it for my little girl and she loved it!
B00AE2J5HI|1.0|I would not recommend this movie.  We were told by a friend that it was a good movie.  Too much violence and no point to it.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I try and live by this book because I truly believe that it works I read a little bit everyday to remind myself to stay positive!
B005LAIISU|4.0|Great movie, and fun for the whole family.  This cast has always been great from the first Ice Age, and they haven't lost any steam in this one either.
B003BM374K|3.0|This was kind of weird. I didn't hate it, I just...didn't get it? The story was odd and unbelievable, the character motivations were strange and also unbelievable, and the overall finish didn't feel very triumphant or super satisfying, it felt rushed.<br /><br />I am an adult, though, and this does seem to be more of a kid movie, so do keep that in mind.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Watching this movie, you will be happy to know that Christopher Nolan saved the best for last.  Christian Bale is solid again as Batman, but Anne Hathaway steals the show followed by closely by Tom Hardy.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|This is a fun and enjoyable presentation of a Jane Austen classic. I'm a British movie addict, and an Austen addict too, so I guess I was destined to love this, but it's good.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Peter Weller was the perfect choice for a grizzled old Bruce Wayne / Batman.  The build up to the drama is a touch slow, but well worth it when it gets going.  Loved the comics when they came out, and love this film too.  Can't wait for part 2!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|dude this game is a total destroyer! it just needs a little more time and it needs to have it where you can tame the animals
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|To provide some insight, I was a teenager when Frank Millers Dark Knight Returns hit the comic stands - and I can't tell you how exciting it was to see those images just jump right into the screen.  I was a little disappointed at how subdued Jokers voice acting felt, but it just adds to his creepiness in the end.
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|I only got this app because it was the free app of the day and I wanted to try it out. I played five levels and then deleted it. I do not recommend this app to anyone.
B008L1F91A|5.0|The attention to detail, the craftsmanship, and the material used make this for a great purchase for any Superman collector.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Wow... that's all I can say.  I love this book so much.  I love how it's written, I love the story, I love the characters, I love everything about it.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I love the animation in the film, but Amazon Prime stops frequently requiring me to restart the app. and resume play.  Frustrating.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is very adicting no matter your age.I just seem to not be able to put it down. LOL.I feel like a kid again. IIt is a game of concentration. Love challenges.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Very good heart felt book! I would highly recommend this book. Wonderfully written and set in Ireland. Kudos to the author!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Second time arounds are hard. This one is fun and informative but I enjoyed the first part of the trilogy better. But I would not hesitate to recommend this as a good read. Follett is a reliable author who knows how to combine fiction with history.
0307477479|5.0|Jennifer Egan is a gifted wordsmith and possesses a profound understanding of human nature.  This book is clever, engaging, creative, exciting and just plain good!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I love Kathy Reich's Temperance Brennan. The books always are full of interesting details, well plotted and lots of fun.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have never read a Michael Connelly that I didn't like. Harry Bosch is a great character with scruples and morals.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I love Joe Walsh and think this is his best album to date.  In this album he has a few songs that express how lucky and grateful he is about his life - the words are very soulful.
0060537639|5.0|This book is well researched and documented.  I'm amazed and astounded by the information.  The author has made very technical information very understandable for the reader.  If you love history, you'll love this book.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Saw them on SNL and immediately fell in love with their music.  Great sound - different - don't know what genre it would be considered but my husband and I just loved their sound and bought the cd.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I drive almost 400 miles every weekend and this album is the perfect companion. These are fun and easy to learn songs.
B000I9W08I|5.0|A very enjoyable movie. Great music.Have watched this movie several times and have always enjoyed it.Highly recommended a genuine classic.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I'm sure there are already 40 million recaps for this book already, so this will be short and sweet. I understand that Mr Collins had to paint Katniss in a corner, but half of the book is pretty much just the main character putting everybody else before herself. She only has the desire to live so that she can save Peeta. She is capable of so much more - she's intelligent, analytical almost to a fault, and she has the ability to comprehend everything yet almost always remains clueless. With this ending, though, Me. Collins has guaranteed herself at least one more sale for Mockingjay. I HAVE to know what happens!
B005DOL0R0|2.0|Should we not have been advised that this particular product would not fit our kindle fire before we purchased?<br /><br />Please advise
076781214X|4.0|peggy sue is a great movie it came right away and was brand new just like it said I didn't pay that much for it either which it the great thing about it
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Interesting story - it caught my eye because my daughter was an aid to a girl with Cerebral Palsy and they also developed a very special relationship.  I enjoyed Moyes style of writing - pretty straightforward, everyday language, though very descriptive - holds your interest - you can't wait to see what happens in the end!
B00AYQNOU8|3.0|Visually stunning. I am more of a fan for a movies with a plot, but the photography, people, culture, and vistas are spectacular.

1596432594|4.0|FEYNMAN is a biography on the life of oddball but brilliant physicist Richard Feynman, presented in a graphic novel format.  This is the second time I've tried this book, because the cover looks so interesting, and I recently read about Feynman's role in the race to create a nuclear bomb and his contributions to ideas on nanotechnology.  For graphic presentation, I give this book 5 out of 5.  However, as a person looking for the reading experience of a biography, I give it a 3.  I didn't feel that I learned much about Feynman, other than that he was odd and brilliant. The physics (and I really tried to comprehend it) was waaaaay over my head, which was disappointing to me.  This may have been my mistaken impression, but I thought the book was about making some of Feynman's theories more accessible to \\"the masses \\" (like me!).<br /><br />Bottom line:  Beautiful  artwork. Interesting and comprehensible story line 3/5 of the time. A book I will suggest to artistic and math-minded high school students who will be satisfied with a \\"reading\\" experience that is mostly looking at pictures and getting an overview of Feynman's life, theories and contributions to scientific thought.<br /><br />About me: I'm a middle school/high school librarian<br />How I got this book: purchased for the library
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's better than the best magazine - every catagory has something wonderful and leaves you inspired to take on projects that were before thought to be improbable to do!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I can't wait for the next story. Totally wrapped myself up in this story. I was pulling for them the whole time. Everyone has screwed up relationships.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Excellent story line!  I thought it was well written and easy to follow.  I can't wait to more of the camel club series.  I am familiar with the DC area, so it was like I could put myself in the story and knew exactly where the story was taken place.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Great movie but may not be appropiate for all ages.  Our Middle Schooler loved it but the younder one's were a little scared!
B004GHBQPG|5.0|Let me say first off I love all of the johnny cash American Recordings albums. My favorite one is the 4th When the man comes around. I didn't think any of them could hold a candle to that one until I heard this! This cd blew me away. Im sure it'll amaze you too :) you will be singing along to it for sure. It'll make you smile, it will make you cry, it'll change your life. Each song is so greatly done. The emotion and heart that this guy puts Into a simple song is downright amazing. I've been around for 20 years and I never heard anyone else do what he did. The best Songs are Help Me, Gods Gonna Cut You Down, Midnight Train, I Came To Believe, In My Time, and Rose Of My Heart. Many Songs you can tell are dedicated to his late wife. If you like great music, Buy this! Don't care how old you are, or what genres you prefer. This will blow you away :) I could go on and tell you all how amazing this record is but youll have to buy it and find out for yourself. God bless johnny cash may he rest in peace with his wife. All hail the man in black. You are my idol.
6305428042|5.0|A great Halloween movie for all ages!  I love this classic Halloween, family friendly movie and so do the kids!
B001H5X7KC|5.0|Best commentary ever. Robert Downey Jr. is in character the whole time. It is funnier than the movie itself.  RDJ is awesome.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Working in a movie theater myself, I have seen this movie 7 times in its entirety and i am prod to say this movie is worth a full purchase, not just a rental. Now i'm not a fan of the genre of this movie which is more love than comedy yet i guess you could state it as a love comedy. Infact i did not enjoy it until my third time watching it, then i continually enjoyed it the next four times. I have seen plenty of people watch this movie and come back days later with all their friends, male or female its a great movie mostly due to Bradly Cooper's and Jennifer Lawrence's skill as actors respectively.<br /><br />I wont get into the plot as i'm sure other reviews have already, but now that i think of it I must add that this movie shows that a basic plot can become a classic with the correct execution. Football and love are the two biggest themes in the story, a smart move to connect with men and women alike. Add the complex Pat and Tiffany's characters past, mental issues, and family to get believable characters that you honestly care about. Not to mention supporting characters role's such as Pat's father played by Robert De Nero. I cant tress enough that the actors are what brings this movie to life. Even with the characters past's and relationships to one another its the actors that bring it to life.<br /><br />Now all movies have a downside, but the good news is this movie has little other than opinions. Such has heavily language and some unnecessary background story, i found that Tiffany getting fired for having sex with all her coworkers is a little far fetched (that's not a spoiler, so it wont mess up much of the story if you did not get the chance to see it in theater). Other than that its basic plot is kinda disappointing to me, but i'm the guy who requires incredible plots like Les Miserable, another great movie if you get the chance to see. Other than that i cant critique it.<br /><br />This really is a great movie that will appeal to adults of both sex, but not a very good movie for kids they will learn a few new words from it far better than public school could. Great acting and complex characters save this movie from any kind of complaints you could think of. I will be happy to go back to work and see it for an eight time. Again this is great movie and defiantly worth $20. Anything over that i would not pay, blu ray would be nice, but the movie already has great sound and picture quality. My apologies for not mentioning that earlier. This movie defiantly has a chance of becoming a classic 100 or more years later after we are all gone. On on final note the directing was fa nominal. Overall a great movie and one that should not be missed. 4 stars.
B009VL299E|5.0|Great show, great footage. Lacking on any special features, but it is just a concert film. This was a great tour with some really cool lasers and lighting. Metallica are still the best.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|quick fun games to play.  some are easy to advance, but some are more difficult  very  diverse game choices. i would recommend this app to anyone looking for a variety of quick games to play.
B009JBZH54|2.0|Packaging is weak. Not great special features. Not the blue ray collection that Gothan deserves, not the blu ray collection gotham needs.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book grabs you from page one and forces you to keep reading!  I was hooked the entire time and really cared about the characters.  I had to find out what happened!

0765325950|5.0|Started reading this way back when ... was hoping for a conclusion.<br /><br />A great job of writing by Brandon and editing to produce a sensational finish.  Did it end up the way I was hoping for ... pretty much!
B0091REZMW|4.0|so far this an interesting hidden object game so I would suggest. this game.  you have. different rooms and options that you can do
B003JTHXOK|5.0|LOVE Nicholas Sparks and I was not disappointed with Safe Haven.  I cannot wait to see the movie to compare the book to the film, but I don't believe there's been a movie of his yet that I haven't loved!  Definite read!  Enjoy :)
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I have been using this on my Samsung GS3 for about a year and now have it on my Kindle Fire HD. It could still use a bit of polish so I gave it 4 stars. Also, the interface is kind of touchy on the Kindle. When attempting to flip pages sometimes an article opens instead.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed the story and at first I had a difficult time with the type of writing, but really ending up enjoying this book.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Loved this book...a different take on the whole &#34;royalty&#34; thing!  Philippa Gregory writes with alot of knowledge and that makes her works believable!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a beautifully written book!  I started this as a kindle sample and from the start was hesitant about the subject matter (who wants to focus on depressing situations?).  You can't help but be pulled in by the main character's voice.  Wise beyond her years (because she has to be), Hazel makes you want to follow her story, even though you have a feeling you know where it's leading.  When Augustus enters the picture, you'll be hard-pressed to put the book down.  I read some great books in 2012, but The Fault in Our Stars will go down as my favorite.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed this book of Gillian Flynn's I had to go back and read her 2 other works!  This, by far, was her best!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this version is so much more complex than the original that it is much more fun to play and for longer too.
B008K6DU4Y|5.0|It was good for me when I play my movies on my tablet  thank you so much for it thanks .
1933952806|5.0|Very well written book for using the Nikon D7000. Does not gloss over the important details and provides great examples and explanations. Thanks to the other reviews recommending it over the other D7000 guides.
B00AFOS6P2|4.0|Australian alternative musician Nick Cave (Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds) release 2013's Push The Sky Away independently via Bad Seeds Ltd. Mysterious, eccentric, and brilliant are all appropriate adjectives for the alt-rock/alt-singer/songwriter affair. Different from anything else released in 2013, the nine-track Push The Sky Away shines brightly, benefiting from its individualism.<br /><br />Opener &#34;We No Who U R&#34; sets the tone, exhibiting a soulful undertone, derived from its groove and the arrangement of strings, horns, and warm backing vocals.  &#34;We No Who U R&#34; also showcases the first instances of minimalism, something that is used throughout the effort.  For all its superb idiosyncrasies and eccentricities, the opener brings it all together on the memorable refrain: &#34;And we breathe it in / there is no need to forgive...&#34; &#34;Wide Lovely Eyes&#34; keeps things interesting, governed by a driving groove led by guitar as opposed to drums. Like the opener, Nick Cave's lead vocals possess a nice presence about them. On the chorus section, background vocals provide more body to the overall sound.<br /><br />On standout &#34;Water's Edge&#34;, Cave quasi-sings/quasi-speaks, truly delivering a 'narrative'.  The tale he conveys is one about young love that is quite descriptive and somewhat risqu&eacute;; he doesn't goes 'too far', but definitely grabs one's attention and raises an eyebrow (or two). The chorus appears at the end, featuring three iterations: “It’s the will of  love / It’s the thrill of love / Ah, but the chill of love is coming on”. &#34;Jubilee Street&#34; follows sensationally, bearing a sound pop-rock/soul percussive groove, intact with hi-hat and tambourine. The highlight comes toward the end, where intensity grows marked by instrumental crescendo.<br /><br />&#34;Mermaids&#34; continues on a suggestive lyrical path, much like the previous &#34;Water's Edge&#34;.  Cave asserts memorably that &#34;I believe in God / I believe in mermaids too...&#34; on the second verse.  On another highlight, &#34;We Real Cool&#34;, lyrics are definitely a strong suit.  On the chorus, Cave sings &#34;Who was it, yeah you know we real cool / on the far side of the morning, who was it.... and I hope you're listening too.&#34;  More clever, however, is his pop cultural reference to Wikipedia: &#34;Sirius is 8.6 light years away / Arcturas is 37 / the past is the past and it's here to stay / Wikipedia's heaven...&#34; &#34;We Real Cool&#34; is a cut laden with tension that leaves you on the edge of your seat just waiting to see what direction it will go in next.<br /><br />&#34;Finishing Jubilee Street&#34; follows up the earlier cut, distinguished by a groove with hip-hop sensibility about it. Cave even goes as far to say &#34;I'd just finished writing 'Jubilee Street'&#34;, returning musical sensibilities back to the heyday of singer/songwriting (60's and 70's).  Repetition remains Cave's best friend, particularly on the chorus: “See that girl / comin’ on down/ comin’ on down / comin’ on down”.  &#34;Higgs Boson Blues&#34; delivers an epic eight minute cut, continuing to share clever lyricism and great diction and annunciations vocally from Cave.  The title track, &#34;Push The Sky Away&#34; ends the album strongly, making good use of pacing, space, and minimalism.<br /><br />Overall, Push The Sky Away is one of the year's more memorable releases.  It keeps the singer/songwriter style alive and well. There are no misses amongst the nine cuts; each possesses something noteworthy and special.  Highly recommended by all means.mermaids too...&#34; on the second verse.  On another highlight, &#34;We Real Cool&#34;, lyrics are definitely a strong suit.

B0034DGPEU|4.0|A similar theme to the Help.  Enjoyed it.  Interesting to read and learn how other people live and deal with life.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Good classic early king writing.always able to make you feel like you are there. Always waiting for his next endeavor.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this novel.  I thought it was going to be more of a spy novel than a personal story of failed relationships.
B009JCL58G|5.0|Several things went through my mind during Cloud Atlas. One of them was &#34;I MUST obtain the score for this film&#34;. The best piece, in my opinion, is easily the Cloud Atlas Sextet. However, the entire score is fantastically written to accompany the movie. Beautiful swells and valleys in the music complement plot events and happenings on screen. A must have. If you like classical music, simply purchase or download the 'Sextet' on its own.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book does a good job of explaining the raid to get Bin laden without glorifying the SEALs like so many other books do.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Relieves stress on my USB port. Still need a USB OTG cable, but that's irrelevant to this review.<br /><br />It attaches quickly and easily, with a 'thumbprint' to help you keep the right side up. It does indeed charge faster (but does not solve Samsung's silly decision to include a 3 amp charger... But that's not related to this review, either) than the USB cable. And it detaches with a neat little snap as I pick the tablet up. USB cable is short, but I don't use the tab plugged in anyway. Worth the $20.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Had to order this after watching the second dvd in the series.  Good dvd, good delivery, movie was not as good as sequel!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I ordered Minecraft for my grandson (age 11) as a reward for all the chores he does for me. He was thrilled!! He told me it was his favorite game of all times. He told me it was great because he  can build and be creative; at night the game becomes sort of scary which is always fun; and the ending is always a surprise (whatever that means).<br />I recommend this game to anyone who has a child that likes to build, be creative, likes to be scared sometimes, and likes surprises.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I read this book before going to the movie to see it. I don't know why I go to the movies, the book is ten times better!<br />I love the connection between the characters in the book, and the twist at the end is awesome.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I saw it as a play and I loved it, so I decided to rent the movie and I loved it as well. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes 1980's music. I am considering buying the movie.
B00000J227|5.0|Very good.  Always liked Rod Stewart.  He never disappoints. A comment is just that and it isn't fair to ask us to include more words.
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|So I have not played this one a little when I did it kept me interesting enough for.its ok. I need to play more to see for sure. I think its somewhat boring b/c its taken too long to Pick it back up again
1451695195|3.0|Am somewhat disappointed that he doesn't talk about many  Jesus, Mary.  Maybe his religion was too much a factor in this.  And this makes me wonder if he really went to Heaven.
B0063IH60K|4.0|My husband and I love to play solitaire, it is a fun game to play to see if we can win!!
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Great movie~ old but still funny. I didn't notice much difference in HD but I streamed the movies to my smart tv and all was great!
B007IK44CK|2.0|Not a fan of the Mission Impossible movies past the first, and yet I still watched this movie.  It was a fun action flick, but there are a lot of better movies out there in this genre.
B002UJIY7A|5.0|I absolutely love Timothy's character in A Perfect Getaway. This movie pushes you right to the edge then pulls you back again. Steve Zahn is wonderful as always.
B008K9UZY4|3.0|This game was a bit hard to play. It got easier as we learned the tricks.  My son loves to play this game.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|My 6YO son received this for Christmas and his eyes got huge when he tore off the wrapping paper.  I love that this set combines both the super hero and the villian.  It makes for very interesting play as I've noticed eavesdropping on my son :)  Lots of tiny pieces & patience needed to put this set together but if you know anything about legos....it goes with the territory!
B007REV4YI|5.0|After all the hype about Skyfall I was disappointed in the movie. It is an average James Bond movie, with all the constituent pieces, chase scene(s), women, at least one archaic gadget (in Skyfall's case), and of course a super villain. But Skyfall was sorely lacking - I have seen better everything, over the years from this franchise, starting with my visit to the local movie theatre in 1965, at the ripe age of 15 to watch Goldfinger. I have long been a fan of the series and have no serious argument with the Bonds' chosen over the years. Some, I thought more suitable than others, but all around, they all worked just fine.<br /><br />The problem with Skyfall is that the promotion of the movie worked out better than the movie itself, including dollars moving from my coffers to theirs. The promoters (critical and actual) get a 5 and the movie gets a 3. The downside is that many critics, who are supposed to be fair (as they are not the real promotors) stated in various tongue, that this is  t h e  must see James Bond. These nere-do-watch critics have forever lost credibility in my eyes.<br /><br />Roger Ebert who I generally include among the several movie critics I read before making an investment, probably because he's been around as long as I have, and, has been correct more than once, until now, gave SkyFall a 4 out of 4 - on a 2.5, absolute tops, movie! Possibly the medication.<br /><br />As always, caveat emptor, rent before you buy (or better, borrow a duped friend's:) and beware of movie critics bearing gifts.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|the movie was good it was just a little freaky to see the yolung actor made to look like Bruce Willis.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok I love it! but I had it on Pc before I found out they had this on pe.honestly I like it on Pc better because ive been playing it for 4 years and I am not used too these controls. but I really like it and it is fun!!!!!!!!!

B00BESLHEA|3.0|This movie remands me of Kill Bill which I also thought was just ok. If guts, flying body parts and lots of blood, then this is the movie for you. Love a lot of the actors in this movie but just wasnt for me.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Good if you already understand chess.  I like the levels of difficulty and the &#34;undo&#34; button is great for any catastrophic bad moves against the computer.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I usually dont care for musical movies, or college based movies but this movie was great. I just love Rebel she is so hilarious and never lets me down. Good chick flick.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is fun I cant stop playing. You will not regret downloading this game plus its free. You will love it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Enjoyable but I found The Casual Vacancy to be dry at times. Very interesting character dynamics though. Not what was expected but it provides a good story none the less.
B0000057C5|5.0|Great CD, I have been a fan for a long time, even though I am not to fluent in German, the beats and lyrics are great.
B00005A3KS|5.0|One of the BEST movies Patric was ever in.  Not to mention it was filmed where I live and work, and a friend of mine was an extra at the end of the movie, he walked right in front of Keanu at the end on Indian Beach!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was very good.  The details in the story was unexpected but it did highlight the sexual abuse of children in the past and the present.
6300263673|5.0|A heart stopper, the best movie next to Pretty Woman!  I can't watch it enough!  Miss you Patric! Rest in Peace!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|The perplexus epic is just great!  I decided to order one after having a couple of days to play with the original version.  It is a mentally stimulating way to pass the time and I would recommend it to anyone.
6300214370|5.0|I love this movie!  It's got a great story and great actors that have gone on to make more great movies!
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|This is where Steely Dan should have gone, pure rhythmic funk music<br />Great to relax to but also great to drive to, made me realize how much I missed groove music
B003YFIUW8|4.0|The author's choice to tell the story of &#34;Room&#34; from 5 year old Jack's point of view is what makes this book spectacular. The themes in this book are dark and overwhelming, and at times even disturbing. But through the eyes of Jack, we see things from a different perspective. Donaghue manages to tell this horrific story without overstepping into sensationalism. Perhaps it is the overwhelming love between a mother and son emphasized in the story that keeps the readers from getting lost in the abyss of the Room. Regardless, Donaghue's approach to this story makes it a uniquely excellent read!
B0058A119G|5.0|Great CD!!!!!!!! Received it promptly and the CD was in great condition.<br />This is a 2 CD unit with all the songs you have heard and some you have not heard.

B003CR9BYE|5.0|Of all the music that Sinatra has recorded, this is the best and most imaginative. How can you go wrong when singing the music of Jobim? They are a great combination.
B00158G2KS|4.0|Very enjoyable read with good tips. Some of it I just can't use but I was surprised how helpful it was

B007REV4YI|5.0|Another classic movie about the Great Man that is James Bond.  I have seen every one, and only one did I not like, sorry Laszeby
B004132HZS|5.0|This show is  awesome and Fantastic! One of the Best shows ever if you ask me. Glad I was able to watch it.
B001LMAK88|5.0|THis movie should have made the return of classic westerns to the bigh screen, I wish it had and made a sequal.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Wonderful music! Piano and cello are great together.  The energy evident in the music is like no other.  I would definitely recommend this music to those that appreciate the genius behind playing an instrument this well.

B0010SKSTO|5.0|This book has opened my eyes and mind into being able to see signs in people allowing me to make any adjustments required for there to be proper communication.  It has also helped me pay more attention to my teenagers body language, to the point that they tell their friends, \\" I can't lie to my mom and get away with it\\".  I read this book twice just to make sure I got all the information right.  You must read to understand.
B004H83IM8|3.0|Picture quality is very good, but the case was broken when the item came to me.other than everything is good
B00ANAC32U|4.0|Its definitely worth it for $20, but not for $60 (got mine from google play).<br />So head to google play and buy it there, if it is still there.

B002G1YPH0|3.0|Used earlier version of this product with a Intel Core 2 Duo two years ago and was delighted with the results.  I Needed to build a new upgraded system and decided to use a AMD FX-8350 CPU.  The Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus looked fine from the ratings and the documentation said it supported AMD AM3 socket.  However the Hyper 212 Plus needs to support both Intel, and AMD CPU's  The issue is that the AMD CPU chip is about 80% larger than the Intel CPU chip.  The cooler interface plate is fine for good contact with a Intel CPU, but will only make contact with about 55-60% on a AMD CPU.  That is not a good concept from a heat transfer standpoint.  The result will be the center of the CPU will have good heat transfer, but the outside of the CPU will have reduced heat transfer.  The end result is that I used the cooler that came with the CPU.  If CPU temperature becomes an issue I will look for a after market CPU cooler that is designed for an AMD chip.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Having the full collection of view options is key. I can bring this to friends/family/parties and it can be played. Plus, for my friends, this is reliving childhood. You can't put a price on that (although this price is spectacular)

1250027624|5.0|The Chronicles of Downton Abbey is a must for devoted fans of the series.  It is rich in details, photographs,insights into the development of characterizations, and background information.  I have especially enjoyed reading about how the actors interpret their roles and bring their own thoughts and understanding to bear in portraying their character.  I consider the series an interesting view of the late Edwardian era and into the roaring 20's with all its &#34;shocking&#34; abandon of previously accepted social norms--in short a social history of the England of those days.  I am pleased to own this book as well as the video series up to now, and recommend The Chronicles of Downton Abbey without reservation.
0307719774|5.0|This is a super easy and fun book to work on. How it works is there are 365 questions total, and you fill out the applicable answer for the current year. The point is to see how your answers vary for the same questions over the course of 5 years. It is great to see where you were in life at the time and how much you have grown. It is a little small, the only thing I would fix it just to make it bigger a little bit.
0736092269|5.0|Very good!!! I had learned alot!!! Highly recommend it!!! It is worth the time and energy!!! You will also Learn and Love it!!!
B00BGD07KS|5.0|I am glad to hear this song at this tough time of mine. This is going to be another classical spiritual song of Mariah Carey's.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|A bit juvenile and raunchy but that is what I expected from the Seth (Ted). Middle of the road on this one.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I will continue to get this series as I can afford them. They seem to get better and hit the marks on current topics to talk about.
B007MJSYF0|5.0|Only saw it once but I know it's a great movie.  It's basically about a group of Japanese students who get thrown into a hunger games type of situation and have to battle it out for survival. ( though this came before hunger games)- There's no way you cannot stop watching it. The plot is good, the acting is good and it keeps you interested until the end. Very unique, different and executed in a way that is near flawless. I only had some minor problems with the end. The whole movie is interesting, compelling and one a kind. I don't care what came after it or what came before it all I know is this is one good movie and is probably unique in itself. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good action/ survival movie or cutting edge film. It's one of those movies that even though it's foreign you're completely into it, transcends race/language, time, etc... Definitely worth buying/ having in your collection.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Great film. Must see it. Great vendor. Good service and communication. Arrived on time. I will buy in the future from this vendor again.
1451695195|5.0|Just when you think all is lost, a simply marvelous depiction of what is yet to come from an unassuming and calm person. Believable beyond the norm was this writer.  Makes so much sense and simplicity out of what is yet to come.  So VERY glad that Eben Alexander came back to impart this wisdom to all of us.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|Brandon Lee definitely gave his greatest performance in this movie.  It's truly a shame that he died, because he definitely had a bright future ahead of him. I also read the book this was based on and I am probably one of the few to say this about any book-turned-film but I love them both.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|I have enjoyed other books by this author.  I cannot stand this book.  I cannot stand the main character. I can't stand any of the other characters.  I'm glad I checked it out from the library so I won't feel guilty returning it halfway through and  deleting it from my sight.
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie had parts that made me laugh so hard I fell outta my seat.  Some parts you can tell were jokes from Family Guy or American Dad that they never got around to using, but I honestly don't mind it at all. It wasn't quite as funny as I expected it but then again I had my hopes up a little to high. I still highly recommend it
B00868AF9O|5.0|This was recommended to me by the nurse in the dentist's office and I love it.  I think I already know the way the book will end but the journey is wonderful.  It's an easy read and quite enjoyable.
B009YQJ322|5.0|This movie has a really simple story line, but it's highly effective and delivered absolutely perfectly! To anyone who hasn't even read a Judge Dredd comic or saw the original Judge Dredd movie with Sylvester Stallone, I can guarantee you'll still love this movie
B000PAAJYW|4.0|Magnolia is one of those films that we're told is 'important,' so you see it. By extension you're supposed to like it. I found it a bit silly and perhaps a tad pretentious. However, it is a fun film. Fun in the sense that I enjoyed bouncing from one interesting character to the next, wondering when I'd get to go back to another character and see where they are in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />The performances are very good, with a lot of Anderson's regulars here. Each character is well developed and enjoyable. The film is a bit long but nevertheless enjoyable.<br /><br />By David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]
B002LANLDK|4.0|I liked the first Fast and Furious. This movie ties the first one and the last one (Fast Five together). I like Vin Diesel and follow his work.
B004EPYZQC|1.0|At least the other movies were plausible. This one was absolutely ridiculous. I cannot believe that anyone likes it. They just pretend to because the critics were paid off to like this junk. I almost walked out in the last hour of the movie, it was that ridiculous. I don't believe all the good reviews on here, I really don't.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is like, the most awesome book ever! I love reading about Greek gods and goddesses. I love it!!! :)
B000FBFN1U|5.0|After finishing A Clash of Kings, I had very high expectations for this book.  I had heard that it is regarded almost universally as the best entry in A Song of Ice and Fire...AND IT IS!  In fact, it is the best novel I have ever read!  I waited two months after completing it before I wrote this, and my opinion has not changed.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Read it with my 8th grade reading class, neither myself or the students could get enough. I read the book in one day!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|A book club selection. Not something I would probably read on my own...but really enjoyed it after I got into it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|WHAT A GREAT BOOK!!!Now I just finished but it is a great book and I'm glad it took me a month to read, cause I understand all the hardships and bad stuff that happened. Bye now. Great book. Bu bye now
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book!  The character was so lovable.  You really wanted him to get better.  The movie was great, but the book was so much better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is AWESOME!!!!! Every day I always play it the only thing I had trouble with is that I accidentally deleted it!!! But other than that it is AWESOME!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't stop reading about these twisted people! What an insane book. I loved how it was told through diary entries.
B005NACYQU|4.0|Again, Neil has made the seemingly normal world turn on its' head, with undertones of the Supernatural TV series bristling through.<br />An excellent, fast paced read!!!
B00870Z05U|5.0|This is an amazing musical and a wonderful return to the music of the night.  I am a purist about the original phantom of the opera so I was worried this might not live up to the original.  It's certainly different, but it doesn't try to be the original.  It does a good job of standing on its own while still teasing in some music from the original phantom of the opera.  The music is breathtaking and the story offers some long awaited redemption.  Well worth watching.
B007V65R54|5.0|I have read quite a few books on statistics, and this one has been the most understandable.  Bayes' theorem gave me fits in Stat 101, but now it makes sense.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|We just finished season one and loved it. It's a new twist for an action adventure show and it's done very well, can't wait for season two.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would like to say I enjoyed this book, but the subject matter makes &#34;enjoy&#34; a difficult word to use.  I was incredibly moved by it an cried at deaths of children, while rooting for the heroine and her partner.  I am glad there are more books in this series, as there are so many questions left unanswered, and winning is not necessarily the be-all and end-all.  In fact, I was left with a question as to whether or not they really won.  I do look forward to reading the next books.
B0019IMVDG|5.0|This movie makes you want to work in a Casino.  Wonderful movie and very interesting.  I would recommend this movie.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Stylish and atmospheric, but without great storyline of Batman Begins. Also, overly long and dragged at times. Overall, entertaining film.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|Great insight into disabilities and the effects on people who love them.  Opens your heart and then it  breaks it.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|If you have seen an episode of &#34;Firefly&#34; and are not a raving fan, you have no ear for dialogue and you'll need to look back to see when your heart turned to stone. Joss Whedon's spaghetti western space opera did not find its audience fast enough to avoid Fox axing it in its maiden season, but the series found its fan base and rose from the grave as the feature film &#34;Serenity&#34;. Unheard of. The fans are passionate and vocal in their love for these characters, these stories, and the 'verse they inhabit. 10 years in the fan base continues to grow. These actors have never had a better ensemble or spoken better words. The crew of Serenity earns your support and love with every challenge they face, every moral decision they make, every job they take. One season of pure delight. A masterwork!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i never wanted to put the book down even though i had already seen the movie<br />this was a really good book
B000001GQQ|4.0|Youthful and bright eyed were Argerich and Abbado when they collaborated on this classic Prokofiev 3rd. Decades have past and yet this performance has not been surpassed. The Ravel Concerto has had equals no doubt, especially Michelangeli from years before. The Gaspard de la Nuit, another masterful performance has been eclipsed only by the eccentric Pogorelich.<br /><br />Argerich has always been a marvel, a fire-breather at the keyboard. The surprise is Abbado. Those listeners used to his safe, boring conducting from the 80s and 90s have to take a look back and see the phenomenal promise he held in the late 60s and throughout the 70s.<br /><br />I keep a half star away because DG's sound is not ideal. It's a bit hard for analogue, lacking warmth. This adds to the thrills of the Prokofiev but takes away some of the atmosphere from the slow movement of the Ravel Concerto. I'm just being prickly and difficult to please, I know. These are stunning performances that have stood the test of time and should be in the collection of any piano enthusiast.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|I got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it. I loved the price it was exactly what i ordered and came in the mail pretty fast.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|As always Denzel Washington's performance is top notch! The movie keeps you glued to the screen all the time. I'll watch it again.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|I loved the thesis of the book a lot but have grown weary of the style and clunky flow of writing over the years and don't like the abrupt, clean endings that aren't believable in modern, messy warfare. His endings are almost too predictable these days, hence the downgraded rating.<br /><br />Great topic but three stars overall.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After finishing this book, I was lured back to rereading the entire series.  It's better than it was the first time!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A  fun game that gives u many choices to use i recremend this if u like games like temple run.<br />Its pretty cool because they change location of the subway
B000SEI230|5.0|Loved it! Would recommend it to everyone! Love Nicholas Sparks, he is an amazing writer and I enjoy reading all his books. I would also recommend the movie, even though they are very different they are both still amazing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! So much fun!!!! It is way better than any other games have played electronically in such a long time! I luv this game!!! Ahhh
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This story is fantastic!  Every detail has its place in the story and when you get closer to the end of the story you realize how all the details are important!  I loved this book, it kept me so engaged the entire time it was hard to put the book down.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Good movie,i watched it with my 8 year old daughter and she loved it.<br />though for some reason when i watch a movie on amazon it works on HD for a bit then it doesn't and that only happens on amazon :/
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 7 year old boys love this game! They can spend hours playing in just create mode. I like that it's fun without being a shoot 'em up game.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|An accounting from the victim on what she went through during her abduction and subsequent incarceration.  The author/victim was able to relay her very intimate feelings, from a young 11 year girl to becoming a very young mother.  Very innocently written not a professional writer which actually makes this book the more endearing.
B0011Z78R6|5.0|See review for &#34;THE LONG RUN&#34; . Do not want to just paste and copy because I want you to know that I am saying that it will be the same.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I laughed, I cried and I cursed.<br /><br />To some the format of the book may be a turn off, it is more of a personal diary. There is not a lot of dialog between characters. (But, really, the poor man is stranded on Mars.) I know nothing of the science behind half of what is described, but Mr. Weir either did his homework or is completly blowing realistic smoke up my skirt.<br /><br />All that being said, I couldn't put the book down.  I had to keep reading to see how the main character overcame the next obstacle that was put in front of him by Mother Nature, NASA or himself.<br /><br />I look forward to my next Andy Weir book purchase.
B005SV9X22|5.0|We love Lady Gaga--she is so unique, and I don't think she can have a &#34;bad&#34; album or DVD.  Again, great costumes, choreography, and danceable tunes.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Because of his education and experience as a surgeon and former non-believer in these matters, I believe he has great credibility and the keen intellect to write this book.
B002H3T3TM|5.0|Another great talent and this DVD provides wonderful dinner music when we entertain.  Some of our guests enjoy dancing to this<br />DVD, also.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I don`t remember when I first played solitare, but it was a long time ago. My grandmother actually had a deck worn round from playing. She would have loved this!
B0068VZNGG|5.0|I bought this as a gift. It's hard to find in my area, so I was very pleased to see that it was available. The recipient loved it.
B002QBS9KE|3.0|It's not that there's anything wrong per se. But, I ordered the earpiece and it came with these so it was kind of a waste of money. I assume it's nice to have extras, but it's not really needed.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I can't recommend this book enough. Really engrossing tale you won't be able to put down! I finished it in less than 2 days.
B00B10ENBA|5.0|Great acting, story, and directing. This is the type of movie that you wish lasted another 2.5 hours!  I love movies that are based on real life events that also have a great book behind them.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Lovers of Star Trek are called Trekkies  - IWhat do you think the followers of Fringe are called??? GREAT isn't a good enough word to describe this Fantastic show. I'm a Trekkie and also a computer systems engineer so I may be a little biased ha ha but I Really Enjoy Fringe. The Best part about this show is that the Sci Fi writers got with scientists and based the stories on True Scientific Possibility!! All of the shows are in the true realm of scientific possibility. As freaky and strange as it all may seem they are all things that really Can Happen!!
0345531965|5.0|Nice religious tie in without being too overt. I would love to read more books like this. I'll keep trying John Grisham.
B003L20IJM|5.0|good quality. i ordered number two just because the first one was so good. I recommend this for the whole family
B009EEFTMC|3.0|This game is neat to play but wish it had more game options other than the two that are given.
B007V2UGPE|2.0|Its a fun game don't get me wrong, until you play more than 15 minutes, cause after that it lags and if you persist to play it crashes and forces you to reinstall it which take 10 minutes to download (longest 10 minutes of my life) so I can only rate 2 stars until glue fixes this.
B0086700CM|3.0|I downloaded this for my grandson & he thinks its great but for me I think its a waste of time.
0439023513|4.0|After reading the first 2 books of this series I had to read this one.  It was good but seemed to drag at times.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great story line here - there's more to this story than just an amazing physical attraction.  Definitely worth reading for those looking for more than steamy sex scenes.
0439023491|5.0|I had already read The Hunger Games and was looking forward to this book.  I was not disappointed at all!!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised that JK Rowling could appeal to my grown up taste. I read every Harry Potter book she wrote and was never dissapointed. This novel was just as well written.
B0090EKRKU|3.0|Your standard Dr. Seuss film.  A subtle adult humor and some good environmental pointers.  The whole cutting down all of the trees and living in a polluted city.
1455869910|5.0|After hearing quite a bit about John Green on tumblr, I decided to pick up one of his books at a local book store. I am very picky when it comes to reading, and when I find a book I like, you cannot pull me away from it until I completely finish it. By the first page I was hooked and ended up reading the whole of it in a day. Warning, if you are as empathetic, as I am, you will cry. And when I say cry, I mean huge racking sobs. I ended up breaking out the tissues, which does not happen often. What I love most about this book is that it felt real. The author has an amazing way of bringing the characters to life, something not many have now days. This will now be the book I recommend when someone asks what to read next.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I adore it! it is a cute movie for children and the family. It was a croud pleasure for my daughters preschool class.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|reminded me my younger age reading all Tintin books ( in french ) very good vocabulary , information from the world etc. loved the movie also.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Mr Weir, most excellent job. thanks for the book! I highly recommend for those who like a space fiction book..
B005IQZB14|5.0|I think &#34;wild&#34; is well written, and a very honest story of her struggles and triumphs. She has not sugar-coated any thing
B004UHL9EK|4.0|The application functions well as promised. My only suggestion would be to add the ability to start timers from the timer list screen and the ability to edited with one touch without the submenu.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I like to watch British films and I was drawn to this because it takes place in small towns. I enjoyed and plan to watch more episodes.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|And I can say so with such certainty because a book that causes an emotional, spiritual (among many other adjectives) EXPERIENCE, must be the brilliant work of a brilliant author.<br /><br />The five (or so) days I spent on this journey, were filled with an array of emotions. Though at times (not many, then it some) the reading became tedious, I never felt like giving up. I had already experienced some of the payoffs in reading such riveting and beautiful parts.<br /><br />I can say, without a doubt, I have never experienced any reading like this. I'd been on a mission to find literature so beautiful an escape and I knew I'd succeeded about 1/10 of the way in. While the first 15-20 pages were...difficult, the rest was magic. How cheesy and cliche I sound, I know.<br /><br />I recommend this to readers of all types. The multi-genre aspect will appeal to many and prevent it from ever becoming stale or monotonous. I also recommend reading the book before seeing the movie as I've only heard positive reviews of the film from those who've previously read the book. I haven't seen it yet but I do hear one common theme among viewers who hadn't read the book before watching and that is that it's too complex to understand.<br /><br />The final thing I'll say about this reading is in regard to many of the hundred or so reviews I read about the book (which nearly deterred me, but thankfully didn't, from purchasing/reading this work.) Many reviewers claim that Mitchell didn't do a great job of connecting each of the six stories together. That while each story is easily good enough to stand alone, they couldn't find a linear connection between them all. First of all, I think Mitchell did so in a perfectly subtle and understated way, but I also think that their connections are, in a lot of ways, left to the interpretation of the reader. This is not an easy task, by any means, but in my opinion, it worked. Finally, does every book we read need to have some clever, profound message? Reading, to me, is about enjoying the journey, savoring each moment as they come. That's not to say I didn't find profound messages, but that's not what it's all about. Take this book for what it's worth; it is a journey, an experience to be savored and used as a beautiful escape, a way to stay in and enjoy the moment. Have zero expectations; simply, enjoy.Reading, to me, is about enjoying the journey, savoring each moment as they come.

B0080M3OGW|4.0|I chose this because I like to see everything that Meryl Streep does. She's is a favorite actress. I also like De Niro.<br />I do like a good old love story and I enjoyed this but it wasn't 5 star.so I gave it 4 because the acting.<br />It was predictable as are most love stories.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Stunning...when you wipe away the dust and mud. Memorable new charachters and some returning favorites gracefully deliver Abercrombie's biting, sardonic, and witty prose. His best work since Blade Itself. Bravo.
B0073QYC2G|4.0|This figure is great and I will keep it but the only thing that I would change about it is that it is a bit glossy. I suppose some might prefer it that way but I think animal figures look more realistic when the colours are matte. It is a good size and very detailed and I am overall pleased with it though!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|not so big than i expected, but everything fit, a lot of spaces and pockets, well made, well package, i
B0073QNIH6|5.0|I love it! I collect dinosaur figures and this one is great quality. I like that it's not glossy like some other figures. I had purchased 2 figures, one for me and one for my palaeontologist mother who had recently helped acquire some Allosaurus fossils for our local museum. A sensitive lady, she almost cried when I gave her the figure! She was so impressed with the detailing. It stands steady on it's feet and I'm very happy with this product!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|First movie in a while to push the boundaries but not be ridiculous and completely over the top.  Love this movie, even during the sappy times!
B008X5CMCS|4.0|i watched this years ago and for a old film it still is a good one would recommend this film for anybody that like this type of movie
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Let me get this out of the way first thing -- I have not seen the Broadway musical \\"Wicked,\\" nor did I make it past the first few chapters of the Gregory Maguire book it is based on.  (I have read the original \\"Wizard of Oz\\" by L. Frank Baum and watched the classic movie, so I'm not totally ignorant of the story...)  So this review will be based on the music CD and the music CD only, though I've been able to guess enough of the story from both the song lyrics and Internet rumors that I feel I can make some comments on the story of the play.<br /><br />That said, this album, a gift from a friend, has blown me away.  I'm a sucker for musicals and their accompanying songs, but this one has earned a special place in my heart.<br /><br />The story of Elphaba, the gifted young woman who would eventually become one of cinema and literature's most infamous villains as the Wicked Witch of the West, comes vividly to life through this album.  The music soars -- there's no other word for it.  Idina Menzel brings Elphaba wonderfully to life, showing her transition from idealistic student to champion of Oz's downtrodden to eventual tragic villain via her superb vocals.  Kristin Chenoweth, too, protrays Elphaba's best-friend-turned-rival Glinda with a wickedly funny twist -- she's a Vally-Girl-esque blonde, obsessed with fashion and, in the end, ambitious enough to leave her best friend behind.  Other characters are mostly incidental in the songs, though doubtless they play larger roles in the musical itself, but the legendary Wizard of Oz bears mention -- in the two songs he features in, his role as a charlatan (which even the original book and movie portrayed him as) is emphasized, portraying him as a sort of \\"scoundrel that means well\\" but whose bumbling ways manage to only make matters worse for everyone involved.<br /><br />The music itself is wonderful, soaring and thrilling one minute, energetic and lively the next, and quiet and thoughtful the next.  It knows when it needs to be majestic and larger than life, and when it needs to rein it in.  I found the songs did a great deal to effectively tell the story, convey the emotions of the characters, and transport the audience to this familiar yet new version of Oz.<br /><br />Favorite tracks from this CD would have to be \\"What Is This Feeling?\\" and \\"Popular\\" (both delightfully funny and showing the beginnings and growth of Glinda and Elphaba's relationship), \\"I'm Not That Girl\\" and \\"As Long As Your Mine\\" (both softer and slower songs, the first melancholy as Elphaba compares herself unfavorably to other girls and the second a sweet love song), \\"Defying Gravity\\" (triumphant as Elphaba decides to seize the day and control her own destiny, but also bittersweet as it marks the breaking apart of her friendship with Glinda), \\"No Good Deed\\" (Elphaba's breakdown song and the start of her descent into darkness), and \\"For Good\\" (one of the most heart-stirring songs I've heard in a long time).  Yes, I have a lot of favorites in this musical...<br /><br />A few of these songs seem to make more sense in the context of the musical, and while enjoyable I don't listen to them repeatedly (\\"March of the Witch Hunters,\\" \\"Dancing Through Life,\\" and \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\" especially).<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful addition to my music collection, with phenomenal singers and quite an emotional punch in places.  Now to see the musical for myself the next time it swings through the Boise area...to be majestic and larger than life, and when it needs to rein it in.

B0015AARJI|5.0|It's hard to rate something you purchased as a gift.  My son says it is fine and he likes it fine.  :)
B001TAJGO6|5.0|I had to watch this a few times to soak in the scope of the greatness this movie had to offer. Definitely one of my favorites.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I encouraged my friends and family to read it.  It made you laugh and cry.Some of it reminded me of the Magdalena Sisters.
0062215507|5.0|My eight-year-old daughter loves this book, particularly the extras like the invitation, etc.  Very cool and full of details.  It wasn't worth what a major bookstore was charging for it, but the Amazon price we got it for was right.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The most exciting 15 minutes of the movie is the plane crash.  The rest of the movie is watching a man disentegrate.  It was hard watching Denzel in this role.  I didn't like the movie at all.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|If you like disaster movies mixed with romance this is the movie to see. Also has spots of sarcasm and a little bit of comedy. Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt make a believable couple in the face of danger and accomplishment of their goal.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Firstly I must say I have just finished this amazing book and I am balling like a little girl! But the good kind of tears, the tears where you know you have just finished something to be remembered. I'm in love with this story, it's everything I expect with so much more. If your on the fence about shelling out money to buy it DON'T be. it's worth your time I swear. Hell, it's 3am and I have to wake in 3 hours but I just couldn't put it down.
0783225547|5.0|Love Pierce Brosnan movies! Lots of action and budding romance going on. Exploding volcano is awesome and camera shots are great.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I had been jokingly referring to this movie with my wife as \\"House of Pies\\" every time she mentioned wanting to go see it.  I'm now so glad we did. Life of Pi was spectacular film-making.  It's one of those movies that seem more than a movie.  It's quite the transformative experience.  Ang Lee's work is genius.  The performances are perfectly pitched without a false note.  We saw it in 2D. Better than a three ring circus in heaven.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Just a horrible book! Hated it soooooooo much!! Will not read the others! Got to page 223, with struggle, and closed it for good!!!! Bye bye Mr Grey and Miss Steele! You suck E L James!!
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I love this app almost all the time. I have the Win7 version on my desktop/home media server and stream to my home/phone/tablets etc... It works perfect streaming to plex apps on android, ios, and myplex via the browser. Love that.<br />XBox is where we have issues. I have several xbox consoles at home. My son has one, my daughter has one, there is one in the family room.  None will stream mkvs. I've tried different settings, read through forums and I can get them to stream the mkv for a while then they throw an 'unreadable format' error and quit. No prob on anything else. Kinda irritating but no show stopper. Plex is still a superior app and I love the MyPlex app interface and the android app interface.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|just try it, you wont put it down, except to rest,lol It gets very descriptive and has mad me feel kind of part of the story
B00002SSKI|5.0|I am so glad I was able to get this movie. My sister and I have seen the movie a million times. We had it on VHS and literally killed it. I love this movie.
B0065CCM76|5.0|I didn't purchase this album looking for the &#34;best.&#34;  I wanted to hear &#34;classic&#34; Seger.  I've listened to his &#34;live&#34; album and wanted to hear the studio cuts again.  On my bike ... in the wind ... Seger in my ears ... in doesn't get much better.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is a hilarious show. One of my very favorites. This is a great season. We watch it over and over.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I am totally addicted to this show. They can't make them fast enough lol. Supposed to be ten seasons total and I can't wait.
B006P0FD4W|5.0|THis is a great scary movie. It scared the crap out of me but that is the fun. I can't wait to see the 4th movie.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  I like that there is a story line.  I would recommend this game to a friend if I had one.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|My boyfriend loved this movie. He says it is one of his favorites. I am not an alien type of girl, LOL, so not my fav.
B000005H40|3.0|O CD veio bem arranhado, a capa aceitável. Mas pelo preço de $ 0;01 valeu a aquisição. Pensei que iria vim em melhor estado.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was a great episode. The video has good quality and it played well. It is a great addition to our collection.
B000005H55|4.0|O CD já chegou e está em bom estado. O acrílico estava bem usado mais já troquei por um novo e o CD ficou bonitão. Obrigado!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Two people go to Vegas.  One to get over a failed relationship, one to deal with an utterly craptastic wedding.  Both want kids without the emotional commitment that comes with a relationship.  They get drunk.  They get married.<br /><br />OH MY GOD I LOVE THAT PREMISE.<br /><br />Look at all those bad reasons to get married.  Or even better, those stellar reasons NOT to get married.  IT WAS GLORIOUS!<br /><br />Alright, seriously though, on to the review.  After the ill planned wedding, and Connor’s announcement that they should remain married, and going to the afore mentioned wedding from hell, they move in together.  Megan’s still not convinced this whole “beget children without emotions” is a good idea, but she’s willing to give it a shot.<br /><br />So  of course she falls in love with him.  And he freaks out, as expected.  What wasn’t expected was his reaction when the strife hits.  Well okay, it was expected, but the way he handles it?  Superb.  I have read a lot of contemporary romances, and this has to be one of my favorite freak outs by a long shot.<br /><br />3.5 stars.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I have Men in Black 1 & 2 just had to have 3.  I like that they when back into the past.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great enjoyable read, very deep and demanding of concentration to keep characters and countries straight, but historical times very entertaining.  Looking forward to the last of the trilogy
B005LAJ16I|5.0|enjoyed watching the first season of Homeland.  would recommend it.<br />I can't wait to watch season 2 of Homeland.<br />A must see
0061733199|5.0|The SAS Survival Handbook is well written, easy to read, and covers many different areas of survival in wilderness to urban conditions. I enjoy reading the authors ideas for how to make shelters, find water, get food, and just get by on your own means.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I came across this game while browsing on the PS network. I tried the demo and instantly wanted to purchase the game. My boyfriend purchased this Collectors Edition for me ( I really only wanted Journey) and am so thankful he did! I normally play some violent games, Killzone, Tekken, Skyrim, etc but this game is totally different. Its so soothing and I dont know how TGC did it, but they managed to somehow connect your emotions with the gameplay. This edition also gives you the soundtrack to all three games and I have to say the soundtrack is phenomenal! I work for a laid back company that allows you to listen to music while you work and I listen to the three soundtracks while I am working on my computer. I recommend this to anyone who wants to try a game that's not your conventional one. I would say this game is a treat for your mind and your heart :)
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Such a great book.  I have never owned an Apple product, but my fascination to read the book came from the introduction.  It brought me in and I had a hard time ever putting it down once a bought it.  Fascinating man.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love this series. And although the sexual tension is now different between the Bones and Booth, it's still a great season.
0446547646|1.0|As a fan of his other works, I was eager to read The Best of Me and Safe Haven. Both were HUGE disappointments, clearly written for Hollywood. Amanda in The Best of Me is a carbon copy of Allie from The Notebook. The plot has everything but the kitchen sink: first love, child abuse, alcoholism, class differences, backwoods goons with guns, car accidents, an oil rig explosion, ghosts, and transplant surgery - seriously??? It was almost like a bunch of elements edited out of previous novels were thrown together to meet a deadline.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Okay, so when I read the review,some of them complained about the way to book was written. I understand that now. She could have used some new words. It repeated lots of the same actions. A little repetitive. The story had its odd parts. A 21 year old collage kid without a laptop...I think not. But for the sack of the story I will go with it. I feel with everything they needed to work thru..she could have added a few more chapters.<br />  I really did enjoy the love making parts,hot !<br />I do think this book lives up to all its reviews of being a erotic,fun novel!
B000NMW6M0|1.0|Not really that good.  \\"Brad Pitt's best film performance?\\"  He must be a bad actor then.  The whole film went She's shot she's shot oh no she's shot, Every character has a short temper and ... Life goes on.  I'm glad the character playing me never meets any of these characters in my life.<br /><br />If you want to see Brad Pitt being anxious and desperate go ahead and watch it.  Otherwise, SKIP IT.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|One of the great classics by RLS.  Thoroughly enjoyed reading it again on Kindle.  Was a good one to get familiar with my new Kindle Fire.
B009AMANBA|1.0|Against my better judgement, saw this in the theater and it was all I could do to keep from screaming.  As a founding member of the National Civil War Center at LSU, I studied Lincoln quite a bit years ago.  I have no idea who this guy wearing the black suit is in this movie, but it most certainly isn't Abraham Lincoln.  This is what Hollywood and the modern political left would like to THINK Abraham Lincoln was like, but this IS NOT Lincoln.  It is a well-made movie, dull at times, but since so many people will take this as historically accurate, it bothers me when they make movies like this.  Decent movie, but it's a complete work of fiction and doesn't portray Lincoln, in his actions or his personal convictions, with any accuracy whatsoever.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like checking the weather just before we go on vacation..Hope it stays nice this time..Can check for the week-end up north too.<br />Now I know what to pack. Very nice app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best series available...if Julian (writer) would just let us keep some of the characters a little longer before killing them off!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|got this for my son which got my grand-daughter hooked on it. Both have a blast playing it. Good app for being free.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book is entertaining for a while but gets a little too much with the sex scenes, blushing, biting her lips, him running has hands through his hair, etc. It's every women's dream to have a boyfriend that's rich & good looking & having him give her his full attention all of the time. But come on, this author based her story on another popular book series but the writing is the most repetetive, umimaginative, book ever.  But I do have to give one credit to the author, she knows how to make the reader want to read the next book.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A real page turner.  I finished it in less than a week, which is pretty fast for me.  The humor is ridiculous but in a good way.  I'm only 27 so i was a bit skeptical when reading a book having to do with a 100-year-old man, but after the first couple chapters I was sold.  Overall I reccomend it.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|I love Kimbra. My favorite thing about Gotye's Somebody that I Used to Know is that it led me to Kimbra's album. She's got an amazing voice! I've been trying to get everyone I know to listen to her for months now!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What a great cast better and better each yr.I HOPE we have more to come about the family go Maggie Smith
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is the perfect distraction it is fast paced challenging and fun it's great to see how far they've come with the graphics and game mechanics
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|the collection arrived closed, in perfect conditions. it was the perfect gift to buy. Excellent collection, its a big box but worth it!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This type of music has never been my thing but when i stumbled on to it i was hooked instantly, and so has evry one who i have passed it on to. I hate to say it but i have always been into the heavy loud slightly more metalic style to water down the truth, now i am just confused. I think if there is real tallent what you are into isnt important, you can't but admire that tallent.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I would recommend for anyone who has ever played, coached or enjoyed watching baseball at any level. As good as the Natural
B00APUQH0W|1.0|The movie FROZE in the first few moments of the play and we could not get it to un freeze<br />This was the second attempt to purchace the Amazon movie porduct and for the second time we are<br />not satisfied
B00003CXB4|3.0|When I was a kid, I watched this movie everyday several times a day. I had all the songs and lines memorized and played out my favorite scenes and songs. When I watched the platinum edition, they had put in extra songs and some of the original songs changed a bit (as advertised). I thought the special edition was going to make this movie even more amazing and that I'd be reduced to tears of gratefulness for having been granted this glorious gift of extras. Instead, it made one of my favorite disney movies seem strange and unfamiliar! Now normally I can really get into extras and deleted scenes being put into a special edition, hence the reason I bought this dvd. But I guess I am too attached to the original version.
0743270754|5.0|First I must give my congratulations to the author Doris Kearns Goodwin, this book is the product of a monumental research job about Abraham Lincoln.  I know there are many historians who have devoted their lives to studying the life of Lincoln, but this work is much more than that, it includes in-depth research about all the members of his cabinet, their spouses, children, and other relatives.  I don't believe anybody else has come close to doing the amount of research done by Doris Kearns Goodwin.  This biography is so comprehensive and detailed that I feel I almost had spent hours living with Lincoln and understanding his world.  Previously I had accepted the consensus that Lincoln was one of our greatest Presidents, but this book helped me to understand how intelligently he managed the Civil War and the politics of these events.  After reading it I can now understand that he really did save the unity of the United States.  It is also unfortunate that he lost his life just when he could have had an even greater impact on history during the period of reconstruction.  Because he died, reconstruction became a disaster for our history just as a century later when the Kennedy assassination threw us deeper into the divisive Vietnam War.<br /><br />In my mind this book is very similar to the novel by Leo Tolstoy, \\"War and Peace\\".  Both books have a similarity in their scope, detail, and story except the American story is true while the Russian story was fiction.  I think Doris Kearns Goodwin comes out the winner in having written the better story.  Thank you Ms. Goodwin for helping us understand the true greatness of Abraham Lincoln.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book has you drawn from just the first few pages.  Putting it down is impossible.  It goes everywhere I go.  His firsthand accounts often make u feel u are in the hide with him, scanning the area for the next dirtbag attemptong harm to our boys.  He also explains a lol of why they do what they to, keeping you informed.  A MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!
B00633W614|5.0|Archer tells a great story.  He is definitely on my list of favorites.  I have read most of what he has written and never been disappointed.  Waiting for the third book to be released.
B00AJLHTT0|5.0|For me, this is THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR!<br />Nick Cave is Rock's Brooding Author with compelling vocals!<br />I love this album!<br />Nick Cave and Warren Ellis = Genius<br />The sound is Heavy.
1616550414|5.0|a Wonderful Book with amazing details, and good printing this is a must have for all Legend of Zelda Fans.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I'VE WORN OUT AT LEAST 4 CD OF RAINSTORMS, (THAT HELP ME REST) HAVING THIS ON MY KINDLE IS A GREAT HELP, THE ONLY CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT IT'S NOT LOUD ENOUGH, I HAD TO ATTACH OTHER SPEAKERS.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This clock is easy to use and very helpful. I believe it will be a great asset to my day.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was an all nighter. I couldn't put it down and I ordered book 3 within minutes of finishing it. Definitely as must read trilogy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great tool with large buttons for quick typing. I really like having this handy tool. Yay math!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Without giving up to much of the story, Wool is a distopia,  a pessimistic view of the future when the last remaining human beings are trapped in a underground silo, but have no knowledge of how or why they got there.<br /><br />The tale is believable and well thought out and the struggles that the main character go through  make this book very hard to put down.<br /><br />There is still so much potential for this story to continue that I really hope that the author continues the series and expand on the world he created. This 5 book series feels like just the start of something that can be truly great and really become a Sci-Fi classic. It is actually on par with books that have won the Nebula and Hugo awards.<br /><br />This omnibus version with all the 5 books is the best way to read it because once you start you must read all the volumes.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|I love Resident Evil.  I love all of them.  They seem to have a nack for keeping your interest. Plus....Milla Jovovich!!!!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is one of the best adaptations of a Jane Austen novel. What's left out of the movie is not missed from the book. Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are marvelous as the romantic pair, but the whole cast is terrific. The movie perfectly captures the depth of emotion found in the book. It has a grittier and more realistic feel than some Austen movie adaptations. If you are an Austen fan, or a lover of true romance, I highly recommend this.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|Its a very good series so far. Although it's not my favorite, hence the four stars. It does have a great story and great plot development. I'll be sure to get the next one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This application is fantastic!  You have multiple reading plans at your fingertips!  It is convenient and portable...ready at your fingertips!
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|It seems that not even Oliver Stone cares about Oliver Stone movies anymore, as he has done his best to make a Guy Ritchie film, here set in SoCal instead of Soho.  But other than that, it all feels very familiar.  Stories like this have been done before and done better.  The film making isn't bad and there are memorable scenes, but everything about \\"Savages\\" is sort of \\"eh,\\" at times compelling (usually the violence) but often laughably dumb.  And the attempt at a Postmodern ending is just lame.
B0095P2TBE|3.0|I guess my title sums up my feeling towards the whole line-up...they're good but not great horror movies. The movies did not keep my full attention for 1.5 hours, which is an indication of a weaker story line because I do love a great horror flick (and realize that we are not dealing with Oscar award winning scripts, which typically put me to sleep)...
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Very good show. I really enjoyed it. Great sci fi, with good acting and pretty cool effects. I would recommend seeing
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I play it all the time on someone eleses ipod m m m m m m m m m m m m m
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|bought it because i love the series and had not seen it.  but rather buy it then rent it especially since it was cheap
B007PTJOV0|3.0|I think it is a good game but the game was lifeless it needs a spark lick a better story line
B0001UL7RY|5.0|kids love it.  and so does my wife.  bought it to replace the old one we had that got ruined
0988936402|5.0|Great job Roy! Looking forward to your continued success and the next installment of Emerville. Please keep me posted on your progress.

B000OCXF0Q|5.0|kids love it.  and so does my wife.  bought it to replace the old one we had that got ruined
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Thank you for a wonderful game with a strong story line. I felt the hint system and game dynamics were much improved from earlier games from this group. I was impressed by the video cut scenes and transitions.
B007V4QMFK|5.0|kids love it.  and so does my wife.  bought it to replace the old one we had that got ruined
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app! it crashes every so often but if you press wait it fixes itself immidietly and is super fun! I love it especily when you get a super mystery box!!! It has high quality and is not very violent. I also love that its free.
B005VPRET4|5.0|My daughter love this product,<br />the price was great on this item<br />I have ordered other Lego friends as a collection and I plan on ordering many others
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have read all their books including many of the individually authored ones. These guys are my favorite in this genre because they cover many subjects from various science topics, history, etc.  Pertaining to history I was a bit emotionally intrigued to hear that the character Constance was a \\"gutter snipe\\" on Baxter Street, NYC.  I had recently re-examined my family tree and found that my grandfather was a little Italian boy growing up on Baxter Street around 1900.  I tried to find the address but it may no longer be there.  Anyhow, there work is much more than the common polce detective potboiler, Michael Connelly, etc.<br />This one doesnt disappoint.  And for those who seem to be let down from this last one who are supposed devotees, maybe you are just bored with the series or bored with life...
0446554995|5.0|My favorite series of books are these written by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child starring the genius, but eccentric character Agent Aloysius Pendergast of the FBI. There are more than 15 books in the series, but they are written in sets of 3 in case you don't want to start all the way at the beginning. This is the 3rd book in this set-and it is fantastic, tying up a lot of the loose ends in the previous books. They are well written, involved, and never fail to keep the reader interested. The characters are well developed, and I am always happy to go back and read a set of 3 over again when nothing else out there appeals. Settling down with a Preston/Child book is like meeting with a cherished old friend who travels the world having intriguing adventures. I just convinced myself to start at the beginning and read the entire series again!
B001FVV2X2|4.0|Science fiction blurs with Science fact.<br /><br />Mulder is now Scully.<br />Scully is now Mulder.<br />Oh, and there is a nutso Dad thrown into the mix.<br /><br />Nice one Fox. Still, an X-Files inspired show.  Difference:  people believe the protagonists.  Everything is much more exposed.  Still, the story drives forward, with the viewer lapping it all up in anticipation of what comes next and why.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The writer kept the characters flawed and yet endearing throughout the book. although sad or depressing in parts I<br /> recommend this book for sure.
B0011Z7JRU|5.0|This album showcases what Led Zeppelin did best, all throughout a double album. Ripping rock songs, acoustic, ballads, gut bucket blues, masterful playing, recording, and production. I could go on about the tracks but everything is captured well in one: \\"Ten Years Gone\\" which is a great ballad about one's first love, but that shows Jimmy Page's dynamic shadows and light playing and writing, when he plays those pensive and spacious Telecaster chords for the verses, kicks in the drive for the choruses, throws in a tightly wound, emotive not-quite-country solo, an aggressive bridge, a harmonized almost prog rock second guitar break and an emotional outro. The sheer amount of musical space left in this material is just jaw dropping. Both Bonham and Jones are solid throughout the whole album, as you would expect. Plant is at the top of his game. If you have to own just one album by Zep, this is it, but it deserves its status as one of the best albums of that time period, and unlike some of the other material of that time, it's aged well. Page did a great job remastering everything after the crummy early CD releases.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|While it's pretty spare in the features area, it is a quick and easy way to access my music collection in the Amazon cloud. I can easily download the content to my player (a Samsung Galaxy S phone that has been re-purposed into a media server) or stream it without difficulty. I would especially like more sorting and indexing options (it's very literal on the artist name - I would like to be able to do wildcard searches).
0345522478|2.0|I really really wanted to like this book. it looked like a lot of witty fun in the reviews. I made it 5 chapters in and am bored to death. I can't find anything interesting in the characters that makes me want to keep reading. The plot has promise but it's not enough to compel me to find out what happens next.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|This Bond film is different from all previous ones. Dark, slow, not as much high tech crazy stuff. Not quit as &#34;light hearted&#34; as most others. It was OK. Glad I didn't pay full boat in comercial movie house.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I like the ability to listen to music immediately after purchasing a CD from the Amazon store . nice new feature that has me using this app !
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I am a great fan of Denzil Washington, but this movie was very diasapointing. I almost cut it off and stop watching it. The movie could have done without the F--- word  15,000 times. Also it could have done without the MF word and the GD word there was no reason to have this words in this movie at all. Not  Washingtons greatest moment at all. A long ways from The Pelicans Briefs.<br /><br />Howard Batton
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great fiction. Would have liked a final follow up on the last guy in jail but otherwise happy reading! Liked the authors note too.
030758836X|1.0|I did not find anything to like about this book.  I do not know why this book received raves in reviews.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this CD.  I almost didn't buy it because my favorite song (Kiss by Jonathan Jackson) isn't on it.  The others are all great, though.  Best CD purchase in years.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Not ususally a romance novel fan, I read Safe Haven on the recommendation of a friend and have to say I loved it.  Read it in about a day and a half and couldn't wait until the movie came out!  Great characters and storyline.
B002RMVAZ8|2.0|Odd selections of supporting and cameo-type rolls (Jack Lemmon as a palace guard???).  Glaring sets. Stilted portrayal of Hamlet.  Just not what I had come to expect of Branagh.  I'd choose Mel Gibson any day over this.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Always on the lookout for a new Agent P book, I enjoyed his latest sojourn.  It was fast paced and entertaining!
B000EZ7ZXQ|5.0|Love this movie so much we upgraded to Blu-Ray.  The scenery is awesome and Adam & Drew have great chemistry together.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Spot on with timing!  This is my favorite genre and I so look forward to Tom Clancy's new releases.  Love all the characters and the storyline makes you shudder it is so close to real life.  Wish President Ryan was a little more involved in the story.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I found it gripping except the ending. Yes, it's probably how that character would handle that life situation, but I read fiction for the surprises and non-mundane endings.
1419705849|4.0|Funny book. It kept my child's reading on focus. He can not wait for the next book to come out.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|It was perfect!  Fantastic price and brand new!  This is my favorite movie of all time!!!  Thank u very much!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The storyline always has me hooked. Week in. Week out. Never an episode that I find boring. An amazing team of writers, producers, actors and actresses. The only thing I wish they would do is show a bit more scenes in actual court rooms. I mean, these guys are supposed to be lawyers yet we hardly see them in courts doing what they're supposed to do. Other than that, GREAT SHOW!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|A long drawn out mystery that got interesting if you held out for the first 100 pages. Quite good after the initial chapters
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just started watching this series. It is amazing and season 3 is super intense and continues to draw me in! love it!
B007U1FEQW|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this &#34;reuinion&#34;, but when I heard the vinyl LP I thought this is the best Beach Boys album since &#34;Sunflower&#34;.  As Brian Wilson has been an inspiration in my life since 1963 when I heard &#34;Surfin' USA' on the radio, I speak with some confidence that even in Brian's weakest periods, he's always had a certain magic quality. Sometimes I've had to cringe a little, but I have always loved him.<br /><br />I thought this was just a cash-in plot by Mike Love to prove to himself that he WAS the Beach oys and have the last word, but it turns out, in my opinion, this is completely a Brian Wilson album, with great support from the surviving members, including Mike, and Brian's usual support team.  There isn't a cringe on this LP, however; just beautiful Brian-type music and sound.<br /><br />If this is indeed the final Beach Boys LP, then they have achieved a full circle unparalleled in music history.  It eradicates the rather pathetic &#34;last&#34; BB's Lp, Terry Melcher's &#34;Summer In Paradise&#34;.  I loved Terry, too, but without Brian, that album hardly qualifies as a last testiment.  &#34;That's Why God Made the Radio&#34; does acheive this, and sweetly. Thank God for Brian Wilson!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a totally addicting show.  The acting is wonderful and the relationships between the upstairs and downstairs people is fascinating.
B004TP6O8O|5.0|I was surprised at the number of &#34;hits&#34; on this album including No Sleep, When I'm Gone, Black & Yellow and Roll Up. This album is some of the best of Wiz and is definitely worth the price.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|A deep dive into the obscure sport of ultra running that leaves you wanting to feel the same natural connection to our world and start running more.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I found this book to be redundant and predictable. Pathetically written and droll. Christian really didn't convince me that he was worth the trouble.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Love this game. It's addicting and you'll find yourself cracking up while trying to figure out other's drawings. But the best laughs are trying to draw your own pics! Highly recommend!
B005I64U5C|5.0|Love this movie! Wish the 3d came out more as my new smart 3d TV is capable of doing, but still love the comic relief through out the movie! fully enjoyed!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game, challenging puzzles. Story was good and it kept my interest for hours. Try to get through it without using hints, the answers are always there!
B00540G3G6|5.0|Best animated movie ever made in my opinion and in 3D, watching was totally amazing! A must for all smart 3d TV owners!
B002G1K82Q|5.0|A great tribute to the artists and times of a very interesting period in America.  Well acted, sung and the choreography is very creatively done.  Merits watching several times.
B00447G29S|5.0|Was totally shocked and amazed at the quality of the movie in 3D. One of the best animated movies ever and in 3D, fantastic!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Used to be the best free game on the market but its been beaten by its follow up: Temple Run 2.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. It contains trains barriers moving trains and three lanes. Swipe and surf your way through this fun packed game. Get it today!
B0098XZHSU|5.0|Found every radio station that I knew and wanted to listen to and a lot more!<br />Top free App, definitely worth it!
B003Z6WFWC|5.0|Heart wrenching, suspenseful and motivating!! Denzel Washington puts on another phenomenal performance. What a wonderfully moving story indeed! WATCH IT!
1400064287|5.0|This book has exactly what you need in order to create a good and sticky story/presentation. I wish everybody who has ever presented anything to me would have read this!
B000TERDNO|5.0|I remember when he first showed up on the scene. I didn't care for his music or his persona. It's funny how my thinking has changed over the years. I now really like these songs and I'm glad I bought this album. I still don't care much for his persona and what it ushered in. The weird and bizarre performers like Lady Gaga and the like.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Got this App cause it was free and I like it. If you enjoy playing Mahjong just go ahead and get it. :)
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is app is a necessity due to adobe discontinuing their service for mobile devices.  I have this app both on my kindle and my mobile phone.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Theres not much to say to this game. I grew up playing it and it will always be a part of my life.<br />- 1 star due to fluency.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I am a Testament fan for about 20 years.  This is a great sounding crunchy thrash album.  It's positively bombastic thrash metal.  The riffs chug hard.  If you like the style of this band on past efforts, I can't see why you wouldn't like this album also.  Well produced.  For what this album is, I'd give it more than 5 stars.  It makes me want to throw my acoustic out the window and join a thrash band.  That San Fran thrash style reminds me of the other big 5, especially Slayer and Metallica, but there's nothings sissified or sold out sounding about this album.  I know the lineup is not the same but Eric Peterson is the style and sound.  He's heard loud and clear.  I like the Powerslave cover, but I'd rather hear this man pump out originals.  Still, kids who hear this version of Powerslave before the original are going to love it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Yes, this is the bible. No its not an old book full of boring stories that does not apply to our daily life. Yes, you want to experience it for yourself.<br />Definitely my favorite Bible App, giving you the opportunity to download every possible translation you'd want, bookmarking important passages and providing reading plans.<br />You don't want to miss out on this free App!
B000001FSU|5.0|This album is great music and nostalgia for me.  It was a classic album that defines this band.  I actually prefer their most recent release even more.  You can certainly hear the band's character State of Euphoria.  I have always had a bit of an issue with the tone of the album because it is pretty weak.  Nonetheless, I don't know if that was fixed at all with a reissue, but I've always thought it doesn't sound very punchy.  If one wanted to get into Anthrax, I would suggest this album is a great starter.  Persistence of Time is excellent.  I never was into the band after the singer Joey Belladonna left, except the new album with him is absolutely amazing.  This album is worth collecting if you dig other Anthrax stuff with Joey piping the tunes.
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|It looks like a lot of people dislike this CD but I'd say if you like her style you'd like this one too. And for $5 definitely affordable...
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, I mainly read it so I could watch the movie which stars one of my favorite actors Emma Watson. While reading the book I thought maybe Charlie had some sort of autism being so honest and socially awkward but it never says but I do get it with what happened between him and his aunt. This book would be a great read for teenagers that are going through the same thing or for just understanding of what others might be going through. I also recently watched the movie and though I thought it left out a bunch of details that tie everything together, I enjoyed the mother better then the book. It gave Charlie a lot more emotion that the book did and made him not so much of a spaz.
B009PAETCG|5.0|Out of the freekick games i've tried so far this is definitely in my top 5! Even comes with good graphics considering its a free game. Don't get fooled by the &#34;bad&#34; looks in the menu, once you click play you don't want to stop.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I chose this rating because the book was extremely good and really well written. I recommend this book to partially young adults and mostly adults.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was already in love with Temple Run but I played it so much that it got old after a couple months.<br />Temple Run 2 made me go back to the exact same spot where I was when I started playing Temple Run. Awesome game that you would not want to miss out on! Can't believe its still free...
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Great twist and spinoff of the real story of  Captain Sullivan &#34;Sully&#34; landing a distressed aircraft in the Hudson river.  As usual Denzel does an amazing job. Just discouraging to see him as a druggie/alcholic. Abit drawn out, but entertaining nevertheless.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Bought this before I even saw the movie cause it was on sale for $5 and heard people saying that its good. Can't stop listening to it since I saw the movie, its that great! :)
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Enjoyed this book. Have read some of the Jack reacher books but it was good to read the first one.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like the game and the concept of it but it is getting boring pretty fast. Would not pay for it but can't go wrong with the free version...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was such a captivating story.  It sucks you in immediately and never let's you go. One of the best books I've ever read. Read it... You'll thank yourself later!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app is simple and beautiful. Easy yet challenging, and gives loads of satisfaction! :-) I like it better then angry birds. I'm glad I got it while it was free app of the day, but it's definitely worth 99 cents. I also got quell reflect when it was the free app of the day! :-D
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|I found it to be a cute movie that kids would enjoy if they don't get creeped out by the characters.
B00BESM14U|3.0|It's an okay movie. Read the book years ago... and I feel like the movie did an adequate job of representing the characters as I remember them. It's definitely a teeny-bopper movie though.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|After reading other reviews of this concert, held the night after the Live At Leeds concert, I knew I had to get it.<br />Back in the day of early rock recording, the engineers had no idea how to mic instruments for maximum sound reproduction. Thus, as a fan of Keith Moon, I could sometimes in The Who's recordings, barely make out the drums and what Keith was doing.<br />This concert recording puts the drums right up front. I've listened to this double cd set and am very impressed with what I hear. I think it's great. I'm sorry it had to take so long to be released, but I believe the technology we have these days was what was needed to process this recording and get the best out of it.<br />There's not as much in line of song introductions and crowd noise, but the music comes across just fine.<br /> If you're a Who fan and don't have this cd set yet, whatcha waitin' on?
B00AHSLU2C|5.0|The movie was simply amazing. My granddaughter loves it she can seat and watch over and over again. They should of made a part two. I would like to know what became of the other fish that escaped the dentist office.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|From the new giant monkey to the various new ways for the Raider to die, this version is an excellent &#34;Phase 2&#34; of the original ga,e.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I love this series and I have no problems with what I bought, if you haven't  seen the series yet you need to, I am telling the truth!!!!!!
B005HSL626|3.0|It keeps me entertained. I wish the instructional material on how to get more &#34;stuff&#34; was clearer, though. I'll be back!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is a page turner that follows a family thru a desperate downward spiral.  Hard to put it down...easy to imagine yourself in the story.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds Rio is terrifically fun! The levels and setups are well-thought out and entertaining. I wish there was a help feature, though, as I am stuck on a couple of levels and can't advance at all.
1455883115|5.0|This book radically shifted my perspectives. I think this is one of the most important books ever written. I simply can't recommend it highly enough. I won't waste time going into details - any summary of the book's subject is pretty clear - I just want to stress the profoundly positive impact this book had on me. If you only read one book this year, read this one. Pinker has outdone himself again.
B0063M22QO|5.0|another great game to help the eyesight and brain be coordinated as one.  plus i enjoy the game.  love this game.
B005LAII8K|2.0|Decent, if you're easily convinced of absurdities, as long as it's told to you via semi-intellectual-dribble, which you think makes sense. _ LOL, and you'll likely think this is the best sci-fi film in years (as many have openly stated in their reviews, laughingly enough).<br /><br />For the rest of us, 2 stars is being generous; and it's only due to great acting by all involved... something that's rare these days.  It's refreshing to see films that are cast based on talent, not just name-recognition (see movies with J.Lopez &/or \\"The Rock\\" D.Johnson, for 2 great examples).<br /><br />But I digress.<br />Despite the great acting, I struggled on the rating because the ending is *awful*... in every possible way... which nearly earned it a 1.<br /><br />If you're someone who actually pays attention to the films they watch; and need for them to make (at least, some) sense, in order to enjoy them... By all means, RENT this first.<br />If you're someone who thinks the most important things in a film is how much action there is, how fast the editing & pacing is, &/or how 'amazing' the special/visual effects are, etc., etc... By all means, go ahead and buy it.<br /><br />PS: B.Willis sure has been in a whole lot of crap lately!  What's up man... has your alimony increased or something?  I know Demi hasn't had work in a while (thank God); but there's got to be a better way for you to get some extra cash, while still maintaining some career-dignity!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My grandchildren love this game.  It keeps them occupied when they are in the car or with me during some of my boring meetings.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This fits very well into the Twilight saga and I love every moment of the movie. I can't wait to watch it again.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Just good reading - good story!  Sometimes it's nice to sit down and just read about other places, other people, other times.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It's okay you benefit more from the game if you have a facebook account. I don't have one. It keeps you busy though.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|All I have to say is WOW, this book was simply amazing!  I could not put this down and by the end you are so amazed by what happens.  I am in love with this book and have refered all my friends to read this.
0345803485|3.0|I'm only on book one it's a good book but it's not how everyone put it out to be maybe I just need to read them all first
B00992CF6W|5.0|it's like lego on the kindle!  The boys think this is the best game we own ... and have many.  I love how it's open-ended and thus you can't &#34;beat&#34; the game.  Very cool and creative!
B002BI6SMI|4.0|The acting was very good. Very suspenseful and action packed.  Very good plot. I loved the scenery and character actors.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|My 21 month old son watches this movie over and over again. He wakes in the morning while I am dressing and will ask to watch Cars.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This film is absolutely flawless.  Kudos to Ben Affleck for directing a thriller without a single missed beat.  What a triumph. I haven't enjoyed a big-budget movie this much in decades.<br /><br />I've now viewed this movie 3 times and it still has the same powerful affect.  The pacing is perfect, the mood of menace in revolutionary Iran is chilling and even though I know how it's going to turn out, it still has me on the edge of my seat.
B004IOVGW0|5.0|This to me is one of the best American love stories and dramas I know. It truly touching and opens the heart. Just beautiful !
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of my all time favorite authors and he didn't disappoint in Safe Haven. A wonderful read!
B00846REIS|5.0|Was a page turner, and get lost in the story book...If you like 50 Shades, you will love this. Its a bit more sexually graphic but not uncalled for.......................
B004NELBPC|5.0|With so much of biased, one sided reporting on cable news shows, if this refreshing to read some real reporting.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Very fun game to lay to pass the time in doctor's office etc. or share with others waiting in line.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the book, easy read and very exciting story line.  I recommend this page turner to all. It's a hard to put down book
B005OCFHHK|5.0|great
B009IEXKXI|3.0|I wondered how is it possible someone gets stranded on Mars?  How is it possible to survive once stranded on Mars?  This book covered all of that.<br />Didn't like:  too much technical detail, protagonist was just unbelievable in his good humor and it became tedious.  But his journal entries were entertaining if silly.
B00B6DTWM2|1.0|Wow ! I really wanted to see this movie when it came into theaters but just did not get the chance. I was so excited to see it for rental. Major let down. The filming was horrible. The characters were unlikable, I was looking forward to them getting killed. No one knew how to turn on a light in the whole damn movie. I kept yelling at the TV (turn a freakin light on already). This was not worth the time or the money.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I like dystopian stories and this was a good one.  It kept me guessing and reading.  I think it could be a good mini series on television.
1936608898|4.0|If you're already familiar with Paleo diets this book might not be for you.  If you're not its a great starting point.  The approach is more about looking at what you eat, the effect it has on your body and ultimately eliminating processed food along with some others from your diet for 30 days as a way to slowly reset your body. It's not about weight loss but health.<br /><br />There is a bit of science worked in, some theory, and strong encouragement to use organic when you can.  One of the strongest points the book makes is its up to the individual to follow the plan and adapt it in a way that works for you.  If you want a blue print of eat this now and that then its not the right book or eating plan for you.  If you want to think about what you're eating, how it helps your body, and are willing to pay attention to the details its fantastic (but not easy).
B000SEIK2S|3.0|This was fun and almost suitable for my teen sons to read....almost.<br />The protagonist was just too perfect and unbelievable.  The concept was fun and I would be willing to read more by this author.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|I love it because it has the cutest thing ever :) !!!!!! Egnor the bad reviews; their all party poopers!!!!!
B007VUCAVO|4.0|It is nice to know which apps use the amount that they do. And how knowing how long you have left for different activities is a excellent thing to know. It is also very interesting.
B009NX409M|4.0|Great interaction between Streep and DeNiro.  Storyline acceptable. Photography is good. The magic is between the characters-they make you want the best for them.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I would love to play this game but I can't get it downloaded to my tablet. I get an error. I know it would be fun if I could get it to download because my grand kids havi it on thier ipods and it is fun. I am hoping I can get it downloaded soon.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Exciting action & adventure flick.  I like the plot minus the 2 guys 1 girl scenario.  That is my only knock on the flick.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I bought this has a gift and she loves all the special features that came with one of her favorite alltime movies.
B0090EJR1K|1.0|A waste of my time.  Not his best movie.  Sacha needs to find a way to evolve & bring more to his films.
B008Y73940|4.0|We enjoyed watching this movie.  The movie shows it's age, but the story is an interesting one and worth a watch.  With the garbage that is out there now, it did what a movie is suppose to do - be entertaining!  I also thought it kept you guessing while the story unfolded.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Decent for a 007 movie.  Average plot, action, & sub-plot.  Below average beautiful women.  Knock.  I wasn't impressed or astounded.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Fast delivery!  My FAVORITE Christmas movie!  So funny!  (Does someone need a hug?)  lol  Plus, if you buy this edition, you get to choose inside between the wide screen and full screen discs, which is nice.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Great drama & very intriguing plot as I have been in an airplane crash myself.  Denzel had a great performance & I was glad to see the flick!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good game. I got it for my 4yo but it is too difficult for her, but I love it. Fun stuff.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this show. And I love that Amazon has the option to buy the episodes before it comes out on DVD.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great story, great characters, excellent acting (especially Mandy Patinkin, Claire Danes, and Damian ? (&#34;Brody&#34;).  Just a terrific show.  Can't wait for Season 2 to hit Instant Video
B008XG1X18|5.0|THE BEST site for EVERYTHING !!!  I'm one of those people who is NOT creative or crafty in any aspect of life.  Changing up meals, entertaining (grownups & kids), decorating, or just stuff for 'fun' is beyond my abilities - sad, I know. Then I found Pinterest. I'm forever changed and oh so much more happier. From the bottom of my heart to the very top \\"thank you\\" to the sites creators,  and to every single person who contributes. You all make my life better, EVERY DAY.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|They don't make them like this anymore. Great movie by today's standards.  Denzel was phenomenal and the movie always kept me on the edge of my seat.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app Is worth it and I think it's awesome so you should get you can use it on everything so get it to see if you like it
B002N44XSG|4.0|It was a good little hour killer. The last short story was my favourite. I just wish the forth book for the heroes of Olympus would come out
B005CRQ4OW|1.0|Have you even seen the movie?!? This has slight resemblance to the movie, but not enough brought call this a book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005SAJJHM|5.0|We love watching this show.  There's always wonderful laughs and they've done the nerd genre to perfection.  This gives me hope that all those nerds out there living in Mom's basement gaming might actually make something of themselves.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great game all except that all of the blocks get all weird some times I don't get it.  But still great game
B0058BI896|5.0|The introduction of Raj's sister was interesting.  She's not a completely likeable character but oh well.  Amy on the other hand is getting really interesting.  I liked this season.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is better than  better,it's great,subway surfers comes second in my book sometimes first but it will never beat temple run 2
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Only fair.  It's an okay movie and slightly entertaining but it drags quite a bit and is very much not true to the original story.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Who could not love James Taylor and Carole King.  An outstanding purchase and the quality of the DVD is truly wonderful.  It is nice to see them perform together.  A purchase that is worth the price for anyone who loves these two.  Quality of DVD and CD is perfect
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book has a lot of insight into the life, training, and preparation that lies behind the heroics you have heard about on TV. Only a very few can attest to the book's accuracy, but I am going to give it the benefit of any doubt.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This second book in the Millennium Trilogy, The Girl Who Played With Fire,  was as brilliantly written as the first; The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  On now to the last adventure; The Girl Who Kicked Over the Hornet's Nest.  This last book, I'm about a third through it, is proving just as mesmerizing as the first two.  If there were  more than five stars in the rating system Stieg Larsson would certainly have earned them.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Simply beautiful, in the typical<br />british style.  All the actors seemed made for their roles. The story winds between humor and pathos.
B004YOEFG8|4.0|I liked what the had on the Solar system, I wish they had put more video of outer space.It is so awesome to see the un limited creation of GOD.
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|Being a film major in college Citizen Kane was a model platform to study and conquer as one of the best films ever make.It was a must have for me and my family to study and enjoy.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I have read better, I have certainly read worse. It is a good story, captivating, but the ending was very disappointing. At times, it was dull, but overall, it was a decent story. It's not one of those books that you would read a second time 'because it was so good you couldn't put it down,' but it was a story that really dug deep and made you think about things. I would recommend to others.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|TripAdvisor is the one thing I definitely consult when planning a trip or travelling somewhere new.  After going to Rome and believing the hotel's website, I quickly learned what looks good on a professional site might not be so great in reality.  I trust reviews by real travellers, and most of my decisions about what to see and where to stay are based on TripAdvisor.  The mobile app makes it even easier, especially with the city guides.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My kids saw another kid playing this game and wanted it too.  They've had a lot of fun with it.  It's a nice, kid-friendly game.  However, it's also fairly easy to &#34;accidentally&#34; purchase game coins if you're not careful (or not keeping a close eye on your kid), so make sure you don't have one-click shopping enabled!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved the account of the taking down of OBL.  The insight in to the life of a Navy Seal was incredible.
B009OYSFDM|2.0|The actors are attractive and wooden. Good series for adolescents who are more into clothes, cars, gadgets, and romance, with a now-and-then bloody fight to break the monotony. As to &#34;Arrow&#34; himself: I am reminded of a review of Talullah Bankhead in Cleopatra: &#34;She displayed the gamut of emotion from A to B.&#34;
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Suddenly the non-tablet version incompatible with Nexus 7 and won't upgrade (or reinstall), yet new version of Swiftkey is compatible with Nexus 7 in Google Play. Only here on Amazon is it the case where the \\"regular\\" version is incompatible with any tablets while the tablet version is compatible with everything.<br /><br />On top of that, the tablet version will not allow you to add arrow keys to the keyboard if running on a tablet but it will if you are running it on a phone. If you run the phone version on a tablet, you can get arrow keys.
1449410243|3.0|I gave this as a gift....another cat lover.  I took a quick look first, but I wasn't very impressed.  Cats are little more entertaining than this suggests.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I was hesitant to watch this movie because, to be honest, it seemed kiddish and I thought it might lack depth. Fortunately, I was wrong in my assumption and I enjoyed watching it. For the current rental price of $.99, I would recommend giving it a watch. If you like movies like Juno and other indie-type of films you should love this one as well. Enjoy!
1452110581|5.0|Except mine do use the litter box only. But you have captured not only the distinct personality that each cat brings to the (ahem) table, but also the interactions each employs, depending on, first, the person with whom it (they are all neutered/spayed) is interacting, and, second, the value placed on either that person or the object.  Free verse is SO appropriate for a cat.  If there were such a thing as gaining insight into a cat's thought process, then this little book is IT.
030758836X|4.0|A fairly long book but a very fast read. Once you get into the characters the reading just flies by and you are tempted to skip ahead to find out what is happening.<br /><br />I enjoyed the unusual style of having two first person points of views. I also have to admit that I didn't spot the clues provided.<br /><br />One character was such a vile human that I just loved to hate them- well done for the author to provoke such animosity in a fictional (hopefully) character.<br /><br />Its worth the read but the ending may have you reeling.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game provides hours of enjoyment. Different levels provide continuing challenges. Some of the puzzles really gave my brain a workout! Easy to learn, and good for all ages.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Could not put it down. Another good story of Jack Ryan Jr. Wish I had read this one first before Locked On.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was a game I uploaded for my young, horse loving, niece.  When I showed it to adult friends, they were as amazed as I was at the realistic graphics. It takes a little work to figure out the different game actions. The sound of clopping, instead of thudding hooves, when the horse was in a pasture were a little disconcerting.<br /><br />Overall and excellent game for all ages!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|What a great story! Engaging, and interesting, it brings you through so many stories to drop you off on the doorstep of wanting to begin running marathons.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|Western, Coming of age (for the Scoffield Kid), buddy flick (with &#34;Ned&#34;), revenge, romance (with dead wife and the &#34;cut up whore&#34;), new man -v- old habits (primal nature), fight against injustice (with little Bill).  What's not to like? I am using my spouse's account, so please don't give her grief about my review.  At a more superficial level, one can see it as a glorification of guns and alcohol, but it is so much more. A man flick worth checking out that tells many softer tales about &#34;manhood&#34; with the re-watching. Great job Mr(s), Eastwood etal.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I love having this instead of the usb charger. It charges more rapidly and is much easier for others to use. I feel much safer knowing that my 2 year old can now pull the cable off without breaking the usb port or usb cable. The only improvement that I could see would be allowing it to plug in both ways. Due to the shape of the Nexus 10 you can only plug it in one direction -- I feel they could have molded it work both directions, but then again I'm a software guy, not a hardware guy. It can come unplugged easily if you're working on the Nexus at the same time as having it plugged in, but it's not that big of an issue since the battery usually lasts all day anyway.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is amazing so many different variiety of games and everything. all around its amazing. I loves it a lot
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Very very good and really addicting. But there is just one flaw I wish it could be a bit different because it is practically the same thing over and over again. But apart from that brilliant!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I hope they go on for 10 more seasons. I also watch reruns on USA. I love it, I love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Having read Slammed for my book club, which then lead all of us read Point Of Retreat.. I couldn't wait for the next Colleen Hoover book to make its appearance.  And boy did she not disappoint!! I would like to say I read this in one sitting, but having started it at 7PM, by 3AM.. I needed sleep, which by 6AM..I was back with my nose in my Kindle, not wanting to put it down until I had finished every word of her amazing novel.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|This book is not for everybody.  You must have a lot of imagination, hope and strength to read these books.  I read all of them because I read the first one (Hunger Games) and I was anxious to see what happened. They descripe a future fantasy world where nopody is free to do whatever he likes. I hope we do not have to deal with such circumstances in the future.
B00722ZHG6|5.0|I had listened to a few of her songs and decided to buy the album.  I can't stop listening to it now.  I love her unique sound and marvel at her talent, especially at that age.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I bought for my boss for his birthday and he said it was really good!He has the 1st season too.
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|I actually had no interest in watching this movie, but I decided to watch it anyway because I was bored.  It turned out to be one of the best movies I have seen.  It's probably in my top ten now.  I watched it on my blu-ray through Amazon Prime, and there were some spots where it paused for a while, but it was so good I didn't really mind.  I'm thinking about buying this movie to add it to my collection.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! Such a clever way to store ideas. Thanks to the awesome sites Pinterest has brought to me, I have learned how to make so many new recipes, I made homemade gifts for the holidays and I have used so many ideas for my home. I use pinterest more than any other app!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I pre-ordered this DVD to make sure I got it as soon as it came out. When it was released the price dropped $5 and Amazon credited that back to me. Making sure I got the best price possible. This is an amazing series and I recommend it highly. My husband is even hooked!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Nelson DeMille is one of my favorite authors. I have read all of his books, and this  is one of his better ones. Only downside is that the plot takes a little too long to unwind.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I have read many of Connelly's books and this was good, but a struggle to get through the middle of the story; however the conclusion was well written and gripping.
1905236042|5.0|I use almost every class these cards, and i dont know why but my students love them, highly recommended. :)
0345803507|5.0|This was an interesting read.  Had a good plot.  Sexual content would make it inappropriate for some readers.  I enjoyed reading the books.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Best book ever<br />You have to read it I loved it and I think you will also if you have read the lightning thief series
0345803485|5.0|I read all three and enjoyed them all.  It had sexual content that might be inappropriate  for some readers.  It was a good read.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A sImple outline to this story but the author knows heaps of scientific stuff that makes this modern-day Robinson Crusoe story very believable. I am far from being nerdish when it comes down to nuts & bolts stuff, but Weir writes with lots of humor mixed in with his obviously well researched facts & figures so its all easily assimilated by the reader. I highly recommend this book - it's fun, well thought out, exciting & quite believable.
B00B5A9FLY|3.0|For casual fans of \\"Merlin\\", the fifth and final season may feel like a rousing send-off, with fine performances from its four leads, a host of returning characters, and a \\"full circle\\" quality to its finale that certainly doesn't pull any punches. For long-time fans that have gotten invested in the characters and storylines, it's an immensely frustrating experience, simply because said characters and storylines have been sacrificed for a tired old formula. With only two exceptions (Mordred and Queen Guinevere) there is nothing in this season - NOTHING - that the audience has not seen a million times before.<br /><br />\\"Merlin\\" began as a prequel, intending to explore the lives of Arthur, Merlin, Morgana and Guinevere before they became their famous legendary selves. Essentially, it was to Arthurian legend what [[ASIN:B003L77GG0 Smallville]] was to the Superman mythos. Yet by this point, the show is not a prequel anymore, but a retelling: Arthur is king, Guinevere is queen, Morgana is their enemy and the Knights of the Round Table have been established. The prequel aspect of the show is over, yet despite all this, nothing has changed for our main character.<br /><br />The unique idea that these particular writers brought to the Arthurian source material is that Merlin has to keep his powers a secret due to a law banning magic throughout the kingdom, resulting in him protecting Arthur whilst pretending to be a lowly manservant. It worked well enough for the first two or so seasons, but by this point, it's been TEN in-show years since Merlin first came to Camelot, and Merlin is still not any closer to revealing his secret than he was at the very start of the show. The writers/producers' point-blank refusal to go ahead with this revelation and capitalize on all the character development and exciting new storylines that could have emerged from it is enough to make you tear your hair out in frustration.<br /><br />As it is, every single episode has only three variations. 1. A good character is kidnapped or injured, requiring Arthur, Merlin and the knights to ride out and rescue them. 2. An assassin infiltrates Camelot and tries to kill Arthur. 3. Morgana comes up with an evil plan (invariably based on either #1 or #2) only to be thwarted by Merlin's magic. I defy anyone to name me an episode this season that does not fall under one of these three categories. The plots are all EXACTLY THE SAME, and the only thing that changes are which parts the characters play (for instance, this season the role of the \\"traitor in our midst\\" goes to a brainwashed Guinevere - the year before it was Agravaine, and before that, Morgana).<br /><br />As well as being repetitive, the stagnant plots completely decimate any intelligence or momentum that these characters ever had. It's hard to see how somehow as foolish and oblivious as Arthur could ever be considered the greatest king of all time (especially since the show has spent the last five years demonstrating that it was Merlin - not Arthur - who was the real power behind the throne) or why we should consider Morgana any sort of dangerous adversary when her plans are so ridiculously convoluted and her motivation so obscure. Equally confusing is how Merlin is renowned as a great wizard. He spends a lot of his time saving Arthur's life and waiting on him hand-and-foot, but he does very little (virtually nothing in fact) to guide Arthur toward being a wise, just, tolerant king. In fact...<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />...he ends up completely failing in what he initially set out to do. From the very start of this show it was stated repeatedly that several things were destined to happen: that Arthur would lift the ban on magic, that he would unite the kingdoms of Albion, and that he would rule over the Golden Age of Camelot with Merlin by his side as his wizardly advisor. Well...none of that ever happens. I repeat: IT NEVER HAPPENS. Arthur is killed by Mordred at the tender age of twenty-nine after reigning as king for only five short years, and without doing anything in that time that justifies his status as the Once and Future King. By the finale, all the prophecies, visions, symbols, and Arthurian references that promised Arthur and Merlin would build a better world together were summarily destroyed.<br /><br />Frankly, it's bizarre. How could the writers actually forget about their own central premise? What exactly has Merlin been striving for all these years? What was the point of any of it? It's hard not to end this show thinking that Merlin didn't just waste ten years of his life doing menial labour for a man who never treated him with much respect for the sake of a destiny that never actually happened. Perhaps Merlin should have been focusing on Guinevere all this time, for if anyone is going to legalize magic, unite the realm and reign over a peaceful kingdom, it's her. (And as an added bonus, she doesn't throw heavy objects at the back of his head while calling him a worthless idiot).<br /><br />As it is, Arthur *does* eventually find out that Merlin has magic - but by the time the confession is made, it's too late to do anything about it.<br /><br />END SPOILERS<br /><br />It's not all bad, I suppose. Even though the actors are clearly ready to move on to greener pastures, they're still charismatic and likable enough to make you care about their characters. The casting agent knows what he/she is doing, as the addition of Alexander Vhalos to the ensemble was a master-stroke, taking over from Asa Butterfield as a now-teenaged Mordred. An ambiguous figure who sends Merlin into a paranoid frenzy over his supposed destiny to kill Arthur, this blue-eyed youth keeps the audience wondering as to his true loyalties and what - if anything - could induce him to kill a king he is seemingly in awe of.<br /><br />Several popular guest-stars return (Annis, Mithian, Balinor, Alator, Uther) for memorable reappearances, and though the other three leads (plus a now utterly superfluous Gaius) are caught in a state of never-ending inertia, Guinevere manages to step up in order to demonstrate how effective she is as Camelot's reigning Queen. The visual and technical aspects of the show (costuming, locations, set-design, special effects) are always beautifully rendered, and there are several highly emotional scenes, especially as the show begins to head toward its grand finale.<br /><br />Still, it's difficult not to get depressed by the possibilities that were squandered. Just imagine if Arthur had discovered Merlin's powers back in season three. There could have been a period of disbelief and recrimination, perhaps even exile. They could have reconciled in a time of trouble, and finally worked openly together as king and wizard. Merlin could have taken his well-earned place at the Round Table. The difficult task of reintegrating magic into the kingdom could have begun, with Morgana attempting to sabotage their efforts by aligning herself with those either skeptical of Arthur's intentions or unwilling to submit to his rule. There could have been a better exploration of Morgana's reasons for turning on Camelot (for some inexplicable reason, her abrupt switch from a compassionate young woman to a one-dimensional evil witch happens entirely off-screen) and more of Guinevere displaying her common sense and political savviness in uniting the kingdoms. The backgrounds of the knights could have been explored (I'm still astonished that they never capitalized on the story of [[ASIN:0744507804 Gwaine and the Loathly Lady]]), Arthur could have discovered the truth about his mother's death, and there could have been a complex and sophisticated conflict between sympathetic villains and morally ambiguous heroes, each portrayed in varying degrees of grey.<br /><br />Perhaps it still could have ended with tragedy - but at least we would have felt that Arthur and Merlin actually achieved something in their lifetimes instead of just treading water forten years.ly superfluous Gaius) are caught in a state of never-ending inertia, Guinevere manages to step up in order to demonstrate how effective she is as Camelot's reigning Queen.

B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors and he did not disapoint in this movie but, from the trailers and all the hype I was expecting a bit move of an action film.  Great human interest story and, I hope, not a story that depicts a typical pilot in the airline industry.
