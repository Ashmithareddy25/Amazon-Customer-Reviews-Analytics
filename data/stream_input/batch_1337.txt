0425166805|4.0|I read this book because I watched the show Ancient Aliens. I found the idea interesting but in the show I did not like it too much because the basis of all theories is that, \\"I don't know, therefore aliens.\\" I gave it a benefit of doubt though because the show is short and they cover a very wide range of history and never really focus in on the core of their beliefs.  So in came this book, Chariots of the Gods. There's no real reason why I selected this book other than the fact that the name of it sounds interesting and it also got a lot of reviews. Since I don't know the subject too well, I figured I'd get some sort of starting point.  After reading the book I can't say I'm all too convinced about aliens visiting us in the ancient times. In the show Ancient Aliens, the conclusion was, \\"I don't know, therefore aliens.\\" In the book, the base of the theories are, \\"If it's possible, then it must be true.\\"  At the start of this book, I felt Erich presented a good hypothesis. Could it be possible that in ancient culture they have seen aliens and describe them as gods since they could not interpret the technology? The answer is yes, of course, it's all possible.  However I felt where the book failed is how he intends to \\"prove\\" his theories.  I felt there are many holes in Erich's logic:  1) He compares his radical idea to that of other thinkers in the likes of Newton, Darwin, Einstein, and many other who made some radical claims that somehow came out to be true. What Eric failed to realize is that these \\"thinkers\\" backed their ideas up with proof and very sound logic. Newton gave his theories based on math and logic. Einstein used math to prove many of his theories. All the radical thinkers used very convincing proof for their ideas that's hard to deny. They didn't say, \\"Well other people made radical ideas that turned out to be true, so this must be true as well because it's just as radical.\\" Eric didn't really do a good job of sounding convincing to me.  2) He says scientists are \\"wrong\\" because they have a failed system of thinking. I think Erich made a fatal mistake here. Science is about being able to reproduce some series of thoughts over and over again. Erich is saying that people in the past were visited by aliens and that humans are too dumb to have evolved to what we see today. He makes claims as wild as that humans are hybrid of \\"gods\\" where they reproduced with us, all the way to being genetically altered to be smarter. If these things were true, then wouldn't it make sense that we'd find some \\"oddity\\" in our dna? Or that we discover that somehow humans of the early period somehow appeared differently than normal? He gives no sound proof other than wild claims and then never backing it up with anything that sounds logical or provable.  Erich also claims that scientists HAVE to unprove aliens. Last time I checked, \\"radical\\" thinkers proved their claims themselves.  3) Many times he claim that certain ancient buildings or land are airstrips of some sort. This is a very famous theory that Erich visits frequently in his book. He shows some photos of areas and say, \\"It looks like an airstrip.\\" I think Erich is somewhat delusional in this regard because it sounds like (in the time the book was written) probably got bored one Sunday afternoon, pull out an encyclopedia and went, \\"Oh my, it's an ancient alien airstrip!\\" I highly doubt that he actually visited any of these so-called \\"ancient airstrips.\\"  I would expect someone who made a radical claim would actually go to these strips and perhaps get samples of soil and other elements. I would expect that if it was a landing strip things like a fuel or energy source, parts of the aircraft, and various other things that would run a major intergalactic air vehicle. However, Erich provides none, and like my claim in #2 point, Erich instead says that it's scientists duty to check this since the theory is possible, it must be fully investigated until proven wrong.  4) He claims thatvarious artworks, religion, ideas, and culture are shared across the globe which asserts his claim that aliens must have visited. The first problem I notice is that many of Erich's religious examples only extend to about the first few chapters of any religious text. It seems like after he looked up the encyclopedia on afternoon, he decided to read the first two chapters of the bible and other religious text and go, \\"Yep, aliens, everyone of em.\\"  Erich's claim is that many of the religious monuments are shared across the world. The pyramids were build in South America as well as Egypt nearly the identical latitude in this world. Erich's claim is that it's too much of a coincident for everyone to share the same ideas. Erich claim is that religion is actually the misinterpretation of ancient astronauts due largely because the ancient people would be unable to determine what they're seeing and only describe what they see in ways that are best understood.  I think Erich has a good claim here but I think where it fails is that fact that he only read what it appeared to me the first few chapters of all the religion texts. I think he missed out on a very large bulk of many religion and was very quick to say that human imagination differs from region to region and that the same ideas cannot be shared among two people at any point.  5) He's very quick to jump to conclusions about monuments being \\"impossible\\" to create and that it's equally impossible that someone would just wake up one day and decide, \\"Hey let's build a pyramid for the next three lifetimes.\\" The main argument is somewhat valid in my opinion in that many of the records were lost about our ancient structure. Erich himself gave an example that if 1,000 years from now someone dug up the statue of liberty they'd probably think we're some sort of religiously crazy country honoring some woman holding a torch. But Erich doesn't state this theory in this fashion with the statue of liberty. What he actually states isthat in the future, people will be too primitive to understand what they are seeing and draw incorrect religious conclusions about the statue of liberty. This implies that in today's world looking back at ancient pyramids, we're too \\"dumb\\" to figure out that it was some sort of alien relic.  I think Erich discredits too greatly about humans. The main fact is that a lot of information is lost about ancient days and similarly our time in the future will probably be greatly misunderstood. It's hard to take a collective thought of millions of people who lived in this world and summarize it in one or two paragraphs. Just as much, information about the past that are missing doesn't necessarily mean that some great ancient alien came down and filled in the gap. It's sort of like saying that if a court case involves someone walking down the street and some timeframe was unaccounted for then it means they must have done the crime. That's basically what Erich is saying here that since the time cannot be accounted for and that things just \\"appeared\\" without a back story that it must means aliens were involved in some fashion. That logic to me is irresponsible and highly speculative.  He also states that ancient Egyptians were smart enough to know that reviving dead tissue was possible and were given some sort of formula by aliens to mummify their bodies so that in the future they can return. This is so silly that I don't even know where to begin. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out you're going to die someday and throughout our times, many men and women tried to reverse this process. Ancient Egyptians were no exception and they had their own ideas about living forever just as much as in our modern times we have the desire to find everlasting life.  6) Erich claims that humans are too dumb to figure out stuff and require a kick start. To begin, it doesn't take a human a very long time to figure out that good things reach for the sky and bad things go into the ground. When you plant a tree it reaches for the skies, not go into the ground. Man looks upwards into the sky knowing that in that lies a great mystery. Throughout time man knew flight was possible because birds flew and things go up in the air for a little while. Man also knew, just as the most primitive animal, is that light is better than darkness. The sun is the source of life for all and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this out.  With that said, Erich claims that man's observation of the sky, flight, and so fort are impossible to imagine. That man cannot dream or use his imagination about the stars. What is known is that since the dawn of time man has looked up to sky and taken great records of the stars. If ancient aliens came down to earth, why then would man suddenly make observations about the stars? If we were too \\"dumb\\" to have known about it, then why build all these monuments and help the \\"aliens\\" go back to the stars? It makes no sense and Erich didn't give enough of a proof to really make a conclusive statement favoring it.  7) Erich claims that aliens came to earth. This is probably the most fundamental of the questions but his claim is that aliens visited earth a long time ago and need fuel source to return home. Basically Erich claims that most of the ancients \\"air strips\\" were created so that the vehicles used by the aliens could be harvested for fuel. The question comes to why is it a world wide effort if the aliens just needed to go back home? Then comes the question why did they need the help of the primitives to build something only they can understand? Wouldn't it take longer to teach the people than it would to just having it done yourself? Erich claim that aliens somehow jump start our world and civilization and that aliens did a lot of great stuff. Yet, he found no proof of anything that the aliens left in terms of advancement. I would imagine that a lot of people got injured or sick building these monuments and wouldn't it make sense that the aliens would teach advance medical science to the primitives so that they're better suited? And also wouldn't it make sense that the aliens would leave behind advanced techniques in clothes, ropes, weapons, etc? Wouldn't they have to guard their ancient airstrips from looters of the time? Or what about the equipments? If massive tonnage of rocks and earth had to be moved, wouldn't there be records of things like bulldozers, advanced cranes, etc? Nothing of the sort can be given by Erich and he only tells us that aliens came here for no apparent reasons and did all these indirect things to us without any sort of direct method. This would equate to us going to another planet, finding the native life there, requesting them to do something, not give them any sort of tools or method, and expect results. It just doesn't make sense and no fossil records or tools, or anything can be found that Erich can give.  The simple question comes to why? Which is unanswered and I think the biggest problem with Erich's idea.  Overall I am pleased with the book. It presented some wild ideas but I think Erich made impressive claims but was unable to prove any of them reasonably or at least give a sound logic. Erich sounds like he just read the first few chapters of religion, looked at a few pictures, then made this book. Overall it's fun, but now I'm more convinced that this \\"ancient aliens\\" idea is just a silly thing. Not necessarily lying but most certainly not thought out very well. You can't prove what happened 100 years ago much less 100,000 years ago and you can go only on what is left. Many things will be missing over time and get lost. I think Erich needs better proof than, \\"Hey look it's possible therefore I have to be right because other people's radical ideas were later proven to be true as well.\\"

B001IMFHVG|3.0|I had the privilege of seeing Artur Rubinstien play Chopin at Fairfield Halls in Croydon, England, at about the time of the Moscow concert - an experience I shall never forget.  As you can imagine, I was looking forward to seeing and hearing the Moscow concert.  Visually, it was difficult to fault, given the level of technology at the time and the actual recital looked as good, if not better than I had hoped, although the encore section of the DVD was not as good.  The audio was, unfortunately, variable and overall not very good and only gave glimpses of the superb variations in tone and mood that Rubinstein was capable of.  Again, the actual recital was much better than the encore section.  Overall, I was delighted to be reminded in such a vivid way of the superb virtuosity of Artur Rubinstein and I am very glad to have bought the DVD.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|I bought this iPad camera connection kit for my original iPad and was pleaed with how easy it was to upload pictures.  I just plugged the camera connector into my iPad, put in my SD card from my camera and uploaded the pictures to then post on a blog.  I like that the iPad asks if you want to upload all, including duplicates, or just the new pictures.  I then upgraded to the iPad 2 for a trip to Italy and again, the camera connector worked easily.  It was one of the most important things I brought with me on my trip.  I wrote a daily blog and quickly added my pictures.  As an aside, I found that I had to use BlogPress instead of Blogspot with my iPad because that was the only way I could add pictures to my blog.<br /><br />I have had no problems connecting and using it with the latest operating system.  I have only used SD connector but I can see where both would be useful when I venture out to trying cooler things with my iPad 2.

I got to the point of skipping entire pages because it was just empty internal monologue.  Awful.

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey introduces us to Christian, a messed up young man with a tumultuous past, looking for something permanent in his life - although he doesn't realize it at the time. His life takes a 90 degree turn when Anastasia literally falls into his office. The two of them have met their match in each other and we follow along as they struggle to build a relationship.<br /><br /> Fifty Shades Darker picks up with more secrets from Christian's torrid past being revealed that threaten to destroy their love. Christian and Anastasia work at picking up the pieces of their lives and attain a deeper understanding of each other; Christian, working at overcoming his past and taming his inner dominant, while awakening Ana's inner sexual goddess.<br /><br /> The books build on one another as Ana works to bring Christian out of his shell. In the third and final book of the trilogy, Fifty Shades Freed, Ana's love helps Christian overcome his self-imposed exile from love and life, allowing him to become the person she always knew he could be. Through the ups and downs of life and tragedy, a kidnapping, and childbirth, Ana and Christian find love, acceptance, and family.<br /><br /> This trilogy tells a beautiful love story. It has love and romance, sex and intrigue, and not for the faint of heart. E.L. James hits the mark with this one.
1933865407|5.0|These days I prefer most things in digital form, but the art book is one area where the physical form has significant advantages.  This paperback version is THICK and relatively large, but the real kicker is the print quality which is superb. You can really study the pencils/inks/colors of Mr Timm's work in great detail.  I will be revisiting this book many times in the near future. If you're on the fence about this purchase, I would recommend picking this up before it goes out of print. The initial run was sold out and prices rocketed to close to triple the cover price. As of this writing, Amazon has it back in stock for twenty dollars less than the cover price (fifty). This price won't last long. This looks like an expensive book to print so there is no chance they are overprinting this sucker.  That said, this book is actually well worth triple figures. I'm such a fan that I'm going to try to track down the hardcover edition which is even more expensive. An impressively gorgeous collection of work.

She didn't need the money and she probably doesn't relish the exposure of her personal life. But she wrote it anyway, because she had a few things to say and realized that her stage time is limited. And the things she has to say about the craft of comedy, working in a man's world, and being a working mom, are delivered with insight and uncommon wit (I even had a couple of \\"milk-out-your-nose\\" moments). Thanks, Tina, for paying your dues then sharing what you learned with the rest of us.

I, however, chose the budget DAW \\"Mixcraft 5\\", for ease of use and low cost. This means that this keyboard will play notes on my VSTi's, but that's about it.  Good construction - and it needs no external power supply, since it is USB powered - I had no idea how convenient that was going to be.  Purchased it on Amazon, and the shipping was FAST!

B0002Y69NG|5.0|Belief-Knowledge-Choice-Understanding and Destiny, so goes the very typically  stylistic Anime cryptic presentation of the thematics driving through the Matrix trilogy.  My summary of plot: Humankind is enslaved to an artificial reality after being conquered by it's own created A.I. In the process of creating this artificial reality in order to harness the conquered humankind's body systems into a powergrid for the machines, they have had to work with mankind's unconscious. This is the realm of timelessness, avatars incarnating into the reality and the nature of soul purpose. These three different facets change the nature of the machine's program concept of reality, thus creating the possibility of peace to be created with free man and machine as a new destiny starts to be set into motion...  Movies: the first Matrix film is very stylistic & compact (via anime, kung-fu, techno music & groundbreaking anime live action special effects) and filled with tension via immaculate pacing as the Hero, a misfit computer hacker Mr Anderson (perfectly suited to Keanu Reeves,) finds his true calling in life and discovers his supernormal gifts in joining with a bunch of wanted terrorists as he finds his old reality not what he though.  Matrix Reloaded: The stylistic canvas broadens in this movie, retaining the same elements but adding others via the introduction of a wider plot, bigger range of characters, new environments with different tone imperatives, greater thematic consequences to different story elements, widespread carnage/destruction and crazy combat scenes. Of particular fun is seeing just what a menace Morpheus is with side kick Trinity, as they launch into full flight of fearless unstopable rampaging within the Matrix in their believe in the prophecy about Neo. While not as cool/slick as the first Matrix or as smooth, this film is absolutely packed with style and a sense of exploration to plot - making it perhaps the best film in terms of scope/depth.  Matrix Revolutions: This is a great conclusion, but doesn't have the beat of the first film, nor the range of the second, but is the best film in terms of being less intense story wise and more laidback as a spectacle in watching.  Animatrix: This is a great disc with superb animes and docs, although the last two animes, Detective Story and Matriculated, don't quite have the Matrix narratives that the first excellent seven stories do- The Second Renaissances I & II being particularly great in a great set.  The Box Set: Superb packing with cool art, and heaps of worthwhile things to watch of many different angles about this immense film work.

B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I would say that this is my very.. very.. best 3D movie \\"EVER\\".  Now we are finally in the new generation of \\"3D\\" TV.  This movie is what the REAL 3D picture is suppose to look like (pure, clear and crisp).  You couldn't ask for better.  Picture quality was 10 stars and 3D images were \\"genious\\".  Lots of \\"pop outs\\" which is hard to find in most 3D movies that are out now (so you'll appreciate this one!).  Keep in mind, this movie is for family viewing and very adventurous.  In my opinion, 3D movies are at it's best in adventurous.  I can't see a love or drama movie being made in 3D (LOL..).  However, I hope they keep it coming with more adventurous movies like this.  You should own it, you will NOT be disappointed.  One of the best 3D movies so far in 2012.  Whoo.. hoo...

He's down on himself so much that he won't even tolerate hearing accolades of his past triumphs.

B005P3NPXG|3.0|A so so effort from a gifted singer. His previous effort in revisiting soul classics was a better effort than this one. I'd rate that about a 3.5 stars.  Soul2 is a technically sound album that does nothing newer than the original classics. It is a bit puzzling as I would have liked Seal (whose talent is unquestioned) to really tweak the songs chosen so they can really come off with a new twist. \\"Lean on me\\" easily the best song on the album was not enough to save it from being a 3 star effort. For someone of his caliber, I expect more than what I got.  Five bucks would be a fair price to pay for the whole album as I cannot fault the production effort in anyway.
0307396789|4.0|In a story that seemingly opens upon an ordinary, yet hot summer day in the year 1935, we meet several characters in a family, from the youngest daughter Briony to her older sister Cecilia.  Their \\"cousins from the North\\" are arriving, and Briony, who fancies herself to be a talented writer, has created a play.  One that will really impress her older brother Leon.<br /><br />At thirteen, Briony is at that age when she thinks she knows more than she does, and, in fact, she must drive that point home in every situation.  Unfortunately, this trait will change her life and the lives of everyone around her by the day's end.<br /><br />A young man named Robbie Turner, the housekeeper's son, will make several appearances throughout the day, and in one such encounter, Briony sees Cecilia and him at the fountain, interacting in a way that confuses and astounds her.  Later, a series of events involving a letter, another encounter, and in the evening, something that seems like a sexual attack will set in motion life-changing moments that will unwind and unfold irrevocably, casting Robbie as a violent predator and severing the ties of a family.<br /><br />Throughout the pages of [[ASIN:B0031TZAI4 Atonement]], we follow Robbie in his war struggles and are privy to his thoughts about Cecilia, with whom he corresponds; he seems to be hanging on to the thread of an idea that something might change, that Briony has recanted.<br /><br />Then we jump to Briony, who has turned to the back breaking and difficult challenge of nursing, turning away from her dream of writing.  Is she trying to make amends in some way?<br /><br />Throughout her life, she regrets what happened, and even writes various \\"fictional\\" accounts of that day.  But will she be able to atone for what she did?  Does she now understand the irreversible damage?<br /><br />The final portion of the book shows Briony as a woman of seventy-seven, celebrated at a birthday party.  In the moments leading up to her party and afterwards, she seems contemplative, reflective, and possibly sorry.<br /><br />Let me say that the story was absolutely chilling in portraying the long term effects of mistaken allegations.  Perhaps in some ways, we see Briony \\"pay\\" with the losses, but in the end, she has people around her.  What of Cecilia and Robbie?  I do not believe that Briony \\"innocently\\" made her charges out of misunderstanding.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I was a little Worried about buying this case. Didn't think it would be as good as the iSkin Claro Case but I think its Way better. I love the fact that the front part of the case goes over and on top of your screen protector and not along side of it (which makes the case kinda peal off the protector from past Case Experiences). It feels like it has added protection with that beveled front still carrying a sleek and slim profile. Case is perfect for my LED lighted Rear Apple logo that people can now see and me not loose protection by leaving the phone without a case. The only thing I dislike about the case would have to be the thickness of the bumper makes you have to give a little more effort to press the buttons on top and side of the phone. Its nothing that bothers me to much to hate the case and is something I have gotten use to already with a day of use. So its not a Bad thing just something I would change in the future. All in all I do recommend this case just for the simple fact of its Cost and Look. The iSkin Claro is about three times the cost and doesn't look as cool as this case. Plus its from Amazon and Amazon wouldn't put their name on Crap.

B004HD61KE|4.0|I started reading James Rollins by chance.  Picked a usedcopy up at a yard sale and have been hooked ever since...  Or was it a CVS? Doesnt matter!. Most of his books would get an &#34;A&#34; or &#34;A+&#34; ...this book gets a &#34;B-&#34;.  That being said this authors just okay book surpasses most authors best works.  His books are That good!  This book just moved a little slow....I put it down numerous times for a few days,the second half picked up speed and my interest perked up as well.  The plot was interesting, but not as well thought out as previous books. i thought the villian reminded me of another villian in a previous book and also the female villian seemed a redo of another character from a previous book.  My only other critisism is while I enjoyed seeing Grey's parents and seeing Monk struggle with whether he wants to stay home with his expanding family...new readers dont know the backstory and probably want to skip past those pages.  All in all a good book.  Beats most authors hands down.  it is just in my opinion his worst Sigma Force novel to date.  If you read it and dont love it read another one...I bet you change your mind.<br /><br />Edit: I  just reread book and liked it much better!!!  Still not my favorite Rollins book, it isn't bad either!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I was looking for a small, inexpensive, in-line amp to help me listen with headphones to streaming video from my computer. With streaming video from Netflix and other services, different programs come across with very different volumes. Some are plenty loud but others can barely be heard. The FiiO brand is the only one I found that offered a small, inexpensive amp perfect for my needs. It appears to be working great. It amplifies the softer programs plently so now they can be heard clearly. There are other, more sophisticated adjustments on the E6 that I will probably never use. So far, this is exactly what I was looking for and it appears to be working very well.

B004EJUMT2|5.0|I used to not enjoy this album so much, party because i had only heard it once and mainly went to \\"Ritual\\" whenever i wanted to listen to ghost. Well today i was doing my homework and accidentally listened to the whole album because i had no time to stop doing a proof, and let me say that that was one of the best mistakes i had ever made. Ghost has created such a fine balance of sometimes completely dark and droning songs, to classic metal headbangers, and all the way to some really great modern pieces like their closer \\"Genesis\\". This truly is a wonderful album that I beg you to give it a chance. I cant wait to see them, opeth and mastodon in march! and I am mainly excited to see ghost.

B006O5XYWG|5.0|I'd seen the original movies.  I'd seen the remake with Marky Mark.  I wasn't going to watch this.<br />But then a bunch of different people in my life kept saying that it was really good and they liked it.  We're talking people I know who don't know each other and each of them are very different from each other.  Does that make sense?  No?  OK Well pushing on:  I really liked this movie!  It was highly entertaining and just a lot of fun!  The CGI-apes are very well done and you easily lose yourself in the story.  I also liked the little things they threw in the film as a sort of reminder of the other films (I'll let you discover them for yourself!).  Anyway, if you're on the fence about watching this, like I was, I can easily recommend it to you.  It's a lot of fun and looks great!!!

030788743X|5.0|I truly believe that you will know if this book is for you within the first five pages or so. I pretty much knew it immediately.<br /><br />This book spoke to me on so many levels that it was almost jarring. I was born in 1974, maybe two years or so after author Ernest Cline and it became immediately apparent to me that I knew the guy who wrote this book, even though I had never met him or even spoken to him. I am very familiar with the stretch of history that Cline has written about with genuine passion in \\"Ready Player One\\", that weird and wonderful passage of time between the late 70's and the very early 90's where everything just seemed that much more special. The amount of pop culture references are enough to make any 80's enthusiast grin in appreciation and brighten up a path for those too young to have experienced this time period to follow. In fact, I'd go so far as to make this required reading for my kids when they get old enough, simply because there's so many references to the movies, music and books that I loved growing up packed in here that I would like for them to experience as well that the book has practically done half the work for me already just by naming them.<br /><br />If you've ever visited an arcade, let alone played a video game, you should read this book. If you've ever played Dungeons and Dragons or ever held a twenty-sided die, you should read this book. If you've ever felt the elation at toppling an almost unobtainable high score in a video game, you should read this book. If you've ever known what it is to fall in love and have your heart broken, you should read this book. If you know who John Hughes is, you should read this book. If you're a geek and you've embraced the fact, you should read this book.<br /><br />In fact, you should simply read this book. It's one of the best entries in the genre I can recommend and Cline's love for the world he has created and its inspirations is so palpable that you can't help but get swept up in it. If I had any complaints, it would be that the book could have been longer. Near the end, things happen a little too conveniently and quickly but those are minor quibbles. Cline has truly delivered a pop culture tour-de-force and when the inevitable movie adaptation gets released, I just hope it's done right as it has the potential to be a cultural milestone the way that most of the movies, TV shows and songs mentioned in the book have long since become.<br /><br />I've purposely left details of the story out of this review because I think a huge part of the enjoyment I got going into this was that I went in cold. It's an inventive story with characters you will grow to love and villains you will love to hate, just like any good story. Try to go in cold as well, you'll thank yourselves afterward.<br /><br />Bring on \\"Ready Player Two\\", Ernie. I've got my quarter up already. And remember, a little Level 42 goes a long way.would be that the book could have been longer. Near the end, things happen a little too conveniently and quickly but those are minor quibbles.

0307949486|1.0|Stieg Larsson's posthumous rise to commercial fame via 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' has been met with, typically, approval or consternation; some view protagonist Lisbeth Salander as a feminist avenging angel and others...well...not so much. Personally, I think there is enough evidence to plead either case, but I fall into the latter camp. After reading TGWTDT it seems that Salander is a victim of both the men who cross her path and her creator's deep-seated sexism.<br /><br />The author identifies as feminist and, as such, the POV of the male characters (ranging from Salander's legal guardian to the entire Vanger clan) openly loathe and exploit women at every opportunity. Many are making the case that the male protagonist, Mikael Blonkvist, appreciates women, but I have yet to see/read an opinion that adequately proves this is the case. Blomkvist is clearly a womanizer and often conveniently finds himself in amorous positions, usually on the job, and sometimes with multiple partners. Did I mention that no one, including significant others', have any objections? Right. Apparently, if you are the lone man in a vast sea of 'men who hate women' (original Swedish title), that refrains from beating, raping, or coercing women, then your character is off the hook. I beg to differ. Case in point, all of the characters, including Salander, are breast obsessed. Too often there is gratuitous mention of characters' breasts to the point where it becomes a personality indicator. The characters with large breasts (and there are many) are often portrayed as affable, whereas small breasted women (Lisbeth Salander is alone here) are portrayed as bitter, resentful, cold, and, ironically, sexist. I can understand, and even dismiss, the despicable abusive male characters shallow beliefs, but to extend the misogynous societal expectations of women to look and behave a certain way to the protagonists POV is troublesome. The extreme eroticized violence trope doesn't help either; suffice it to say, the fact that sex and violence (often combined into violent, humiliating sex that ends with the death of a female character) sells books, movie tickets, and even boosts television ratings, says much more about how popular culture views women than Stieg Larsson ever could.<br /><br />Mixed messages aside, TGWTDT is in desperate need of an editor. It's fortunate that bogging down the plot with extraneous information inadvertently makes for a great film adaptation because there is so much material worthy of being cut. It's tough to call your book a mystery/thriller when the action crawls along at a snail's pace; TGWTDT could have easily been two hundred pages shorter. The political machinations of a fledgeling magazine publisher are not half as interesting as the author insists. A dragging plot, coupled with a convoluted storyline, makes it impossible for the subplots to go anywhere at all let alone somewhere interesting. As a result, the characterization also suffers; instead of proving these characters have the means to defy convention, thereby becoming three dimensional, Larsson spends six hundred pages treating the audience to banal minutiae peppered with a god-fearing wild goose chase. Including every detail, from the time Larsson's protagonists go to bed to what they ate for lunch and everything in between, is just plain unnecessary. On the other hand, this meticulous writing style might reflect Blomkvist's job as a journalist turned private detective, but, in this case, that's giving the author way too much credit.<br /><br />Overall, TGWTDT suffers from bad writing and an ill conceived premise supposedly touting feminism. How is this book feminist, exactly? All of the female characters are tools; props used and abused by the domineering men in Larsson's guilt-fueled* dystopian reality. TGWTDT lacks any redeeming qualities making this first effort impossible to recommend. I look forward to seeing the movie, but will be taking a pass on the next twonovels.<br /><br />*An allusion to Stieg Larsson's admission that he witnessed a gang rape and did nothing. Supposedly this is the reason he wrote the books, but witnessing rape is not enough to lead to an understanding of feminism.g Larsson's admission that he witnessed a gang rape and did nothing. Supposedly this is the reason he wrote the books, but witnessing rape is not enough to lead to an understanding of feminism.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Loved the first two... wish I'd stopped there. So depressing. I read to escape; if I wanted this kind of story, I just have to turn on the news. The author turned beloved characters into depressed, suicidal, weak, losers. And the killings! She made us love these characters and then killed them off, with nothing to show for it. I kept turning the pages...expecting the story to turn around...and nothing. To top it all off, there's no real climax. It's just FLAT, all the way through. And where's the love story? Katniss would never have left Peeta to be tortured for so long. She would have saved him with her life. And the ending...really? Boring. I'm so disappointed. I would never recommend this book. If they make a third movie, I hope they make it completely different.
0385535139|4.0|Great bood, great author, the next in the line of product by one of the biggest authors of the day.  Well worth the hard cover for the price.  Enjoy!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Warning: SPOILERS  I want to like this book more than I did.  It does a lot of things right, most of the characters are as interesting as ever (some more than before - Theon Greyjoy, I'm looking at you - and I remember your name), and you can tell it's building up to something big.  But...  very few noteworthy things actually happen in this book.  Yeah, we have Dany flying Drogon, a rebellion at the wall (it would appear), and the deaths of several important characters (granted, I'll be surprised if Jon doesn't return - either barely surviving the betrayal or being brought back by Melisandre the same way Beric Dondarrion kept being brought back to life)...  but for the most part, it's slow journeys across the land, a lot of talk, and very little action.  Had there been more scenes of the same nature as Ser Barristan dueling the arena fighter instead, I might have gone with a 4, but there was too much walking (what is this, Lord of the Rings?), too much talking, and too much stalling.

B005Y423ZC|2.0|Every now and then, an artist will burst out of nowhere and become an overnight sensation celebrated by critics and audiences alike. The album will top charts and sweep awards. Following this, total obscurity. It'll be interesting to see if Adele can sustain her audience.  I did a double take when Adele appeared. It was hard to believe that this matronly figure is in her early twenties. Adele resembled a frumpy forty something.  Don't get me wrong, there are some decent songs. But on the whole this concert reminds me of those singers who talk a lot to fill up a show. My eyes wandered from the TV screen during her nasal banter. Her inane cackle was absolutely grating and at one point I wished she would just shut up and do her songs.  The audio disk was a lot better as it cuts out 30 minutes of sometimes littered with obscenities irritating chatter, thus allowing you to focus on and appreciate her music.  This DVD was heavily advertised on TV and aggressively pushed by the shops. One chain overstocked and slashed prices, so curiosity prompted me to get a copy.  Adele Live At The Royal Albert Hall was just passable for me. I won't pick adjectives like brilliant or fantastic. This one is strictly for hardcore fans. Casual listeners can give this a miss. I foresee this item going to the used DVD store soon.

I Totally love S&M, (sticks and stones may break my bones but chains and whips excite me!) The lyrics aren't exactly original. It was on a key chain my friend carried in the 80s. What's My Name and Only Girl (In The World) are unapologetic ear candy. Fading seems to contain an Enya sample while power ballads like California King Bed and Love The Way You Lie (Part 2) proves Rihanna is not just a dance pony.<br /><br />The cover is as arresting as the music. If you lift up the CD, there is an erotic depiction of the female anatomy by means of a rose and some fur.<br /><br />Loud is Rihanna's best work to date. Next in line would be A Girl Like Me. Rated R and Good Girl Gone Bad were kind of uneven.<br /><br />This CD is best played LOUD!<br /><br />Enjoy!

043902353X|5.0|Okay, I'm hooked, just like so many others. I'm happy to be in the middle of the wave of excited readers caught up in this intriguing Big Brother type series.<br /><br />If you haven't read The Hunger Games you really should before picking this up. This is not really a stand alone book and should be read in the series.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to feel a smooth continuation of storyline from The Hunger Games. There was nothing that didn't make sense or follow the character or feel of the first book so it was very familiar territory.<br /><br />The progression of the story is great and leaves you hanging on wanting to read what will happen next. Which is why Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3) is waiting on my Kindle for me to begin.<br /><br />Although The Hunger Games takes us to a place that we can never imagine (which is what I think makes it so terrific) Catching Fire places us back in a now familiar place but still takes you on twists and turns you couldn't imagine.<br /><br />A great sequel and a worthwhile read.

B002SQFZ68|4.0|Was looking forward to receiving this Bluray in the mail. However, while I enjoyed the concert immensely, I was disappointed that the mix in dolby digital mode sounded somewhat un-concert like. Ambient sound was way too loud and vocals were constantly drowned out by the electric guitar and the drums, and like what other reviewers have said, this really pales in comparison to some of the other bluray concerts I have, such as Adele's recent bluray. Switch to Dolby PL2 mode however, and the sound is decent. Loved the concert, if only the mix was better.

Yes he gets a little obsessive, but who hasn't felt that way before when their scared to loose something they love.  He wears his heart on his sleeve when it comes to Abby.<br />Abby Is cool, she could be cooler, but she fits with Travis so well.  She has no clue why the One night stand man of the school has taken a liking to her, but their journey is a FUN one, while it has it's ups and downs, it keeps you wanting more and more.<br />LOVE Love LOVE it:)<br /><br />Update: I'd like to say, that after reading some of the negative reviews about the book on here, it ticks me off how people can say this book is disterbing.  Life is not always perfect and easy, MOST relationships have their ups and their downs.  Travis never hurts Abby, or Cusses at her or abuses her.  He swears a lot and I think some people find it offensive, but that's life.  As far as his Obsession, it's love, it's extreme love.  She's the only person he's ever felt that way about and it's new to him, he doesn't want to lose her, so he acts frantically sometimes, but never in an attempt to hurt her.  This book isn't disturbing, it's amazing.  I love it, and so do a lot of other people.r, so he acts frantically sometimes, but never in an attempt to hurt her.

1594203059|4.0|This is a wonderful, thought-provoking, but sadly undisciplined book.  It's wonderful because Ferguson takes us on a erudite romp through history, ranging from Zhong He's 15th century African voyages to the siege of Vienna in 1680  to the foibles of the French in 19th century Africa to 21st century Christianity in China.  Thought-provoking because it ask the right questions:  Why has the West been more successful than other cultures, and what is needed to maintain the benefits that Western civilization has brought, not just in the West but throughout the world. (In another time and place, these questions might be less thought provoking, but in the current intellectual climate -- when one can be charged with racism merely for suggesting that not all cultures are equally conducive to human flourishing -- his ideas plow intellectual ground that for too many will be new terrain.)  Undisciplined because in his exuberant exposition of all he touches on, Ferguson ultimately fails to prove his thesis.  A lot is thrown up on the wall, a lot of it sticks, but in the end, its not clear that what remains paints the picture he wants it to.  More on that below, but first a summary of the main points of the book.  Ferguson maintains that the West surpassed \\"The Rest\\" of the world because of six defining characteristics that come together in the 16th century.  (In a sop to the iGeneration, he annoyingly calls these characteristics \\"apps\\", a mistake that will date the book in a few years.)  These six are competition, property rights, science, medicine, consumerism, and work.  Each of the six main chapters of the book are devoted to one of these characteristics:  * Competition:  This refers not so much to the free market as to the fact that European powers were small and fragmented.  Their drive to dominate each other drove them to innovate and to search for riches in the New World.  This contrasts with China, where the monolithic state had no rival and was ruled by a complacent elite fully convinced of the superiority of all things Chinese.  Thus, no drive to explore or change.  * Science:  The West developed the scientific method and exploited its technical applications.  Despite the early appearance of certain technical advances and inventions in China, these were never developed systematically in the Middle Kingdom, and the underlying scientific method was never formulated.  * Property rights:  To some degree, this is misnamed, because his point is more about the rule of law in general.  In the West, even ordinary people could expect a certain degree of legal protection of their rights, most significantly that of property, which enabled the rational deployment of capital and labor to commercial ends.  * Medicine:  Obviously, the ability to eliminate disease and heal injury vastly improves the quality of our lives.  The West figured this out first.  * Consumerism: We have learned to want more, which is an impetus for business to produce more, and more cheaply.  * Work:  Echoing Max Weber, Ferguson notes the Protestant roots of the West's work ethic.  More importantly for Ferguson, the literacy that Protestants fostered (in order for people to be able to read the Bible) brought with it a whole host of benefits in increased intellectual freedom and economic creativity.  Ferguson concludes his book by wondering if the West is losing these six virtues, and whether the rest of the world, China in particular, is picking them up.  To add a little frisson, he discusses theories about the decline and fall of civilization and leans towards those that favor a sudden, \\"tipping point\\" collapse. It is not clear whether he feels the West must maintain a relative superiority over the Rest, or whether he is just arguing the West ought not to neglect what makes it great.  The conjunction of these six characteristics no doubt go a long way to explaining the West's success.  Yet I said above the book is undisciplined because in his discussion of these characteristics, much ink is spilled on topics that are essentially irrelevant to his topic.  If you are going to put forth a list of factors that made the West great and are needed to keep it that way, you have to answer two questions:  First, why those factors made it great, and, second, why those factors arose in the West and not elsewhere.  Most of the discussion does neither of these things.  The chapter on competition draws the obvious distinction between Europe and China.  But the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas were also fragmented, and that didn't spur them on.  And if Europe had still been united as in the days of Charlemagne, would that really have prevented the West's rise?  It is not clear at all.  The chapter on science is devoted mainly to a very interesting comparison of the declining Ottoman Empire with rising Europe, noting particularly weaponry, but without any real discussion of why science developed in the West and not in Turkey.  The chapter on property is a bit more to the point, showing how the much wider distribution of property to North American settlers as compared to South American led to greater prosperity North of the border.  But the second half of the chapter is a long discussion of the differences between North and South American slavery in which the property principle also plays:  North American slaves were more fully property than their South American counterparts.  But Ferguson is quick to deny that the application of property rights in this case had anything to do with North America's prosperity --- so why bring it up?  The chapter on medicine is mainly about the nature of French imperialism in Africa.  Very interesting, but not really to point.  Besides, isn't the development of medicine just an application of science, i.e. shouldn't it have been subsumed into that chapter?  The chapter on work is the best, but Ferguson seems to imply that China's economic rise is due to the spread of Christianity.  It could certainly be argued that China's work ethic is more naturally attributable to the Confucian stress on education and the next generation (delayed gratification).  This possibility is not considered, and that is a general problem with this book. Alternative hypotheses are not robustly engaged.  Despite having just said Ferguson overreaches in attributing China's work ethic to Protestantism, my biggest critique of the book is that in its wide-ranging discussion, if fails to see that in 15th and 16th century Europe, Protestantism was a driving factor not only behind the work ethic and literacy, but also behind the other factors as well. Protestant Christianity placed a high worth on the individual and the individual's right of conscience. This was by far the most important change in the 15th century.  Property rights (rule of law), medicine, and consumerism can all be seen as manifestations of a high regard for individual well-being.  Respect for the individual also places a high value on freedom, which views competition - an inevitable outcome of the interaction of free individuals -- as a good thing. Science, too, despite the popular perception to the contrary, has its roots in Christian thinking.  All of the great scientists of the 16th century were Christians who were confident of the possibility of scientific discovery precisely because of their belief that the natural world would operate according to divine laws that are comprehensible by reason.  They viewed the \\"book of nature\\", together with Scripture, as part of God's revelation to us, and their job was to open that book up.  It was only later that science and religion were viewed as conflicting.  But despite failing to tie things together the way I like, this is a great book, well worth your time.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I bought Born to Die solely on the strength of Video Games, which to me is one of the most startling, poetic and current songs in recent memory ('current' because it reflects, with aching poignancy, the state of contemporary life). Few artists have successfully tread the line between self-aware vamp/vixen/starlet and serious artist (with a genuine point of view on life as we live it today), but Del Rey really manages the impossible and makes it compelling, smart and intoxicating. The lyrics in Video Games have been slammed for triteness, but that's a fatal misreading: she uses words sparingly (as Leonard Cohen might), but the lyrics convey subtle depth and complex emotions with amazing assurance and economy. Few artists can be this cinematic with lyrics that, on first blush, might appear pedestrian -- it's quite the feat. The quasi-rap/trip-hop rhythms and rhyming choices are also highly musical and accomplished, wrapped in lush orchestrations and subtle electronic flourishes that add dimension and nuance. And her voice is actually quite effective, sliding from coquettish girlishness one second to knowing sultriness the next.  And that's only Video Games! While the entire album might not match that peak (how could it?), Del Rey can't be faulted for it -- it's a very solid album with a lot I still have to discover in depth and through closer listens. While she recycles a few images here and there (the red dress, taking that body downtown, etc.), those are pretty minor flaws. I just love the way she flouts convention and feminist expectations, too: she's having none of that. She can be hopelessly in thrall to the gaming-obsessed  man-boys who try to define her, but she is fully aware of her complicity in her own heartbreak and loneliness. Her music reflects a very personal view of the world and how she defines her experiences within it -- in the age of the Kardashians and the complete vapidity of her peers, that's incredibly refreshing. She's also playing with roles and expectations, as well as authenticity and performance, in a way that no other contemporary female artist is, that's for sure. She's daring us to judge her based on the artificial 'look' she's perfecting, all the while demanding we take another look at the real merit underneath. It's genius.  All tolled: brilliant, haunting and impressive debut. Don't shortchange this girl by writing her off as some millionaire's fembot creation with fake lips and no talent. Nothing could be further from the truth.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|I like to download the old movies on Youtube to my Tablet and then I can share them with my wifes droid device (using an SDHC chip). We love the old movies found on Youtube as that is what we grew up with. I have also burned them onto a DVD (many of them in MP4 format) and then played them on my Apple micro and my desktop computer. I have friends that come over and we all love the older westerns especially. Pop in the DVD in my sony HD player (also a droid device) and play movies all night long and eat tons of popcorn. This little piece of software makes it all possible. I love it as I am sure you will - get it today! for sure
B000T05R8Q|5.0|This is a very good 3cd set, with stereo, mono and early singles. The mono has a diffrent sound to it, that makes it sound so diffrent than the stereo. The singles cd is a nice treat also. It comes in a nice book with pictures and lyrics. Not sure if they will come with new remaster for 2012 or not, but the sound is quite good on it. It might be hard to find this item as time goes on.

B002LVUG3C|5.0|This 40th Anniversary Edition of David Bowie's second album sounds and looks great, definitely worth the effort of buying again. It comes with thick, informative booklet full of insights on the times around the recording process and a worthy second disc of outtakes, b-sides, alternate mixes and the like.  But, of course, it's the absolute brilliance of the original album that truly shines here. Recorded in 1969 around the time of the Woodstock Festival, \\"David Bowie\\" sounds amazing on this reissue - something which only enhances the power of classic songs such as \\"Space Oddity\\", \\"Cygnet Commitee\\", \\"Wild-Eyed Boy From Freecloud\\" and \\"Memory Of A Free Festival\\". It also marks the lift off of a very fruitful association with legendary producer Tony Visconti who, oddily enough, only declined production help for \\"Space Oddity\\", a song which he could not stand apparently. Gus Dudgeon then took care of that one. All in all, this album is very unique, as it flows like nothing else in David's released output. A very inspired and free effort - Bowie had found his way.  I wish all remasters sounded and were released like this: a combination of sound quality and thoughtful presentation. Easily a five star release.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I had always wanted to read this, and while getting in touch with my inner geek, I decided to plunge into it. All I can say is \\"Wow!\\" It was a gripping story from start to finish.  When I saw that it was written in 1977, I was worried that the technologies described would seem dated, and this was certainly not the case.
0201433079|5.0|This is a solid UNIX reference book. You won't be disappointed. Yes, it does require you to use it's library of functions, but that makes it easier to focus on the important concepts.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Written from a dog's perspective, Garth Stein's \\"The Art of Raving in the Rain\\" offers a refreshing respite from the standard mainstream best-sellers. Although the reader knows from the get-go that Enzo has reached the end of his life, his brutal honesty and quippy narration keeps a reader hooked from page one.  Take the ride with Mr. Enzo; it's well worth it.

Well worth the money. the only problem was when I gave it to her it's in my name and we can  not change that. She receives all my emails and everything she buys goes on my computer and credit card, other than that it proves you can teach old dogs new tricks, we are near our seventies. Danny
B0068TL23G|5.0|This is so much fun! It works really well on my Kindle Fire. It starts off easy then slowly game after game it gets harder and harder. It is a game that makes you think and figure things out. I have really enjoyed playing this. Keeps you sharp!

B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I have seen pretty much every Jane Eyre movie that has been made. I would definitely say that this one is my favorite. I did feel though that they could have put in more scenes from the book to get a fuller feel of the relationship, and that the ending was too abrupt. I do love who they chose to play the characters in this one, too. I will definitely be recommending this one to all of my classic loving friends.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Honestly I became interested in this book due to the publicity from the movie and read it free as it is part of the Kindle Lending Library.  I was hesitant because it was so specific to the Oakland A's - a team I know little about.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised!  First -- Billy Beane is a big front office name in baseball.  I was very surprised to learn about his early years as a player.  I had no idea he actually played the game and was the frontline prospect he was.  It was very interesting to me as a fan of the TB Rays to see how the A's worked through the process of placing a value on some of the less thought of offensive statistics.  The TB Rays have done something similar by placing a value on certain defensive statistics.  Reading about some specific players and how they fell into the A's organization at the end of their careers was interesting to me as a baseball fan in general.  I do believe this is a great read for any fan of baseball in general.  The statistics the A's revolutionized back in the day are now everyday stats.  This was a fast read, held my attention (which is difficult at times - LOL) and was informative as well. Nicely done!  Would I recommend this to a friend:  Absolutely!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I'm really enjoying this app. it makes you think but not too much. great way to pass some time without becoming frustrated.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Very informative showing how the \\"other half\\" lived, I hope this has changed for the better.  Well acted and an enjoyable time spent viewing.
1401216676|5.0|Nice twist to the story and changes your perspective (a little) on Batman and Joker's relationship. Great book to have in your collection and good conversational piece for those of you who like the dynamics of these two iconic anti hero, anti villain.
B005K17RU0|3.0|causes kindle fire to freeze up on occasion, slow to update and constantly running in background . Hopefully the next update will remedy this
0061205699|5.0|I lost her book that she's had since she was in eighth grade and felt really bad so I purchased this edition and she appreciated it very much.  I don't know if she's opened it but hopefully it'll make up for the lose.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|Great watch. Simple and keeps good time. I changed the watch band to a softer model as the PVC band supplied was a bit hard. Just personal preference. Delivery was prompt and price was lowest I found on the net. Very happy !!
B006OT03BM|4.0|Everthing was in working order. Except the DOTM disc started to skip in the middle of the movie. Kinda strange. Called amazon and the service was absolutely exceptional. Right away they put the order in the replacement. Same shipping and everything. Just be you check the disc before you play it. Movie sounds completely amazing in 7.1 surrounding sound.
B004FJOEFY|5.0|I never really knew much about this band. Read the book for a book club. Wow - what a read! It's amazing these guys are still alive! Although there was a lot about partying and being careless, there were some deep moments. I couldn't put the book down. Very entertaining and page turning!
B005K0HDGE|1.0|As soon as the Janitor character appears with his cliche language and mannerisms, along with the 'WTF?' corniness of the narrator (what planet does this take place on?) I knew I was in trouble, but when I realised that this was my fav author King doing 1st person for the entire novel, I knew enough from past experiance of reading his 1st person narrators that this would be next to unreadable. Add to it that its a Romance to boot, which was also the subject of Kings single worst book ever (forgot the name but it was one of the Dark Tower books) and this dear reader knows there are other more satisfying ways to spend a cold dark night. Hence, in my wisdom I bagged it after less than 7 pages as this aint my first rodeo, pard!  However, I have to say this: Kings last collection of shorts, Full dark No Stars, is an A++ excersise in incredible storytelling. Compelling, scary, just the real meal deal. Life long King fan-just keepin it real.
B006C1DH92|3.0|lags on droid razr maxx. processor is plenty good enough and should not lag. fix and four or five star. thx
B005LAIGFU|4.0|Lionel Shriver, the authoress of the book on which this movie is based has expressed her total satisfaction with this movie adaptaton. I was glad to have first read the book since imho it encompassed more comprehensively the mental anguish of the mother in conflict with her maternal instincts, or lack of them and the understanding and horror that her son had a twisted side, seemingly only apparent to herself.  Irrespective the movie can stand on its own merits since Tilda Swinton is indeed brilliant in the role of the disturbed, indeed devastated, mother trying to come to terms with her first born's hideous deed. Ezra Miller does well in the role of the psycopathic teenager : nice looking (but so was Ted Bundy) silent, menacing, up-yours attitude. We all hope for the children that we can be proud of but the reality is in birthing them we throw one of life's greatest dices.
B00631VJIC|4.0|bought this album because i thought it would be a great piece for collection of m/c paraphernalia. proved to be an eye opener as it brought to light the singing talent of 'gemma'. who would have known that she is such a musical talent with such a great voice? fun piece to have, glad i grabbed one up...
0439023521|4.0|I'll summarize quickly since there's plenty of reviews. The writing is very, very basic. This is not a book you'll have to analyze, or look for symbols, or anything like that. The book spells out everything you need to know, you don't need to close read at all. The pace is very fast, yet it's enjoyable. I'm a reader who prefers deeper novels (Crime and Punishment is my favorite) but I still enjoyed it. Worth it for the price 100%!
B004EPZ070|1.0|While the book was amazing, this movie was dull, boring, lackluster...  It veered far from the book and missed some incredible parts of the story. Skip the movie and read the book.
1451627289|5.0|I'd give it 6 stars if I could. He's getting better, and this was perhaps his best. The ending? I actually did sort of guess it, but still a great story and reflection on history and time travel.
0316098329|5.0|This is the first book that I have read by Donaghue and let me tell you that it was amazing!  I love it when an author can take a character and a situation and bring it to life to me on the page.  This is exactly what happened to me with young Jack.<br /><br />Jack is the little boy that was born in Room and has never had any exposure to the outside world.  He doesn't know what he is missing outside, because he has never experienced it.  All he knows is the house that his Ma made for him in the small room that contains all of the necessities for someone to stay alive in solitude.<br /><br />Jack's Ma remembers her life in the outside world before she  was abducted and locked away from society.  She loves her son Jack, but she also longs to have her old life back.  Although she appreciates the companionship with her son, she also desires relationships with other adults, and often when she can't handle life in Room any longer she will mentally retreat to a place that will not allow her to return until she is ready.<br /><br />I am not going to give any more of this story away as I don't want to ruin it for anyone that hasn't read it yet.  This is a story that could very possibly be pulled right of current headlines and even when people are rescued from these conditions, their lives are never the same.  They must find a way to learn the rules of our society once again and even harder still, is being able to offer trust to any individual who comes in their lives.<br /><br />This was an amazing story with themes of love, comfort, safety, abduction, and perseverance.  I think this book would make an excellent book club selection, but it also is great for leisure reading on your own.  I highly recommend this novel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is so awesome that my family enjoys it also that ... it's awesome it's fly the maker's don't know why.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I liked this alot but I'm not sure if was worth the price. I swear the PC version seemed longer and had more \\"mini-game\\" type stuff. It's pretty much all there and if you've never played a Plants vs. Zombies game it's a must have. It loads slow but once it is loaded it runs fine. I would say having a newish phone/tablet would be recommended.

I luv SFM pc as size minor and performance maxium.
098478280X|4.0|I agree with the all the other reviewers that this is a must read book for any job interview.  Especially for the people who are out of touch with the job market, the interview process or  trying to get into the Tech companies.  My only problem with this book is that at the first glance, I could find only one chapter allocated  to C++ questions.  Also I found the algorithms and Data structures mentioned in this book to be very helpful.  But, again almost all the solutions are written in JAVA.  For C++ developers need to look up on the web for the solutions and that is what I had to do.  I bought this book so that I don't have to spend my time searching for solutions.  It would have been nice if the C++ solutions were also included.
B006YXTRHY|2.0|If you gave this movie five stars then I can't imagine you read the book. The books are always a million times better than the movies. I think it would be worth it to have five parts to this movie just so it could be more accurate to the book. Of course some hate he books but I really enjoyed reading them. If you hate the books then you are just a Twilight hater so this review does apply to you at all. If you really enjoyed the movie then I beg you to read the book because you are really missing out. I loved the series of books much more than the movies.

B0067DBHBU|5.0|Since I bought this on cd at a record store I fell head over heals in love with it. I'm a heavy metal type guy but this album was jamming on the speakers of the shop and I asked the clerk what it was...to my surprise it was DAUGHTRY and i said eff-it I'll just take a chance. Turned out to be the best album of the year for me aside from TIMES OF GRACE's premium premier album. It's emotional, it's filled with soul.It's go its hard rock elements and Daughtry sure can write music, plus his voice is beautiful. Buy it and set yourself free. It's definitely an album you can make memories with. My advice listen to it over and over and over. I use it as my work out album now. It works for me!

B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book brought me to tears multiple times while reading it. The way Lisa Genova writes is amazing. I felt every emotion coming from each character through this entire book- and loved being with them every step of the way. Before reading this book, I have to admit I did not have a clue of what Alzheimer's was like on a person, a family.. but this book has opened my eyes, and I now have such a compassion for the daily struggles of what it feels like to go through this confusing time for people with this disease.<br />What a compelling book. I recommend it!
B005MYEQ4U|1.0|I almost fell asleep twice, but pushed on, hopefully. Plot virtually non-existent. Writing (sleepingzzzzz).. Directing phoned in. Casting phoned in ('Send me five famous-artist-wannabes, three achingly hackneyed 'Ugly American family type cast-ettes', no experience especially necessary, etc., etc.)  The question torturously remains: WHO voted for this movie for best picture?  I've heard that sometimes Academy members toss their ballots to their grandchildren to fill out. Could it be 'they'?! I refrained from criticizing Owen Wilson at first due to his rumored suicide attempt; but, could it be that that is why some people actually voted for him? Seriously, (because it was not his acting that dragged this movie down Wilson actually showed some elan and was the only memorable character (but, to what end?) -- it was all of the above).  The Ugly American Family's daughter, Wilson's character's fiancee, went on so long in her one-note blandness and flat, insensitive awfulness that we wanted to shoot her -- again, director/writer's fault).  .  Th e magical '20s artists were so hackneyed and boring that only the very unread young could be interested in each one as he/she appeared. Sophomoric all around, characters as written, and audience members who voted for them.  Typically high cinematographic values.  I threw the disc away in disgust at more money/time wasted.
0439023521|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, I was unsure about reading it since I'm almost 30 YRS OLD and I heard this was a Young Adult Book! However, I found it intriguing, gut wrenching, and couldn't WAIT to get the next two books!! Loved it!
B003Y5HWJU|1.0|I thought this concept was a pot into which so many many movies were chucked, stirred around, and the putrid, repeated bits which floated to the top ladled out to make Boardwalk...  One-note killer/greedy sociopath, meaningless killings, woman in background. Sociopaths are boring, and this one is so hackneyed I fell asleep several times throughout wondering what the fuss was. There seems to be virtually no redeeming human values. (No, giving the money to Kelly MacDonald's character is not out of pity or remorse, but because he sees an opening -- somebody to use, who, being needy, could need him.)  Is this society so without humanity that so many people tout this one-sided junk? I liked The Sopranos, 6 Feet Under.  If you want to watch a fresh, original story, with all great actors, plenty of killings,   see Justified 1 and 2. It's resl, and I didn't turn away for a second. Each series is one tight story (not one predictable droning on, like Boardwalk), each series with a satisfying ending -- no maddening hooks as in so many tv series. Recommend!

0312370849|5.0|Enjoyed this book with all the historical events.  Lots of information that I did not know.  Parts of it were very depressing.  Very in depth and explicit on the Holocaust events in France.
B005N0PJJO|4.0|The story picks up exactly where the first book in the series ended, with Anastasia trying to live with her decision to leave Christian. She's inconsolable, even though she was the one who walked away and she can't eat or sleep well. It isn't long before Christian re-enters her life and they decide to resume their relationship, with Anastasia asserting herself more and Christian trying to come to terms with being in a different kind of relationship for the first time in his life.<br /><br />The email communications between these two are some of the high points of this story. Their banter and cleverness provide humor as well as forming the strength of their communication with each other. Ana feels more empowered to express herself with Christian in these exchanges and he shows another, less controlling side of himself. People from Christian's past provide some tense moments for the two of them and threaten their reunion. Also, Ana's new boss, James, proves to be another challenge. As they explore each other in trying to maintain their fragile relationship, they are also having their own self discoveries.<br /><br />I continue to be mesmerized by this couple. This is more than an erotic tale, even though there's plenty of that and I've gotten an education! There's something raw and honest about the two of them, an innocence that they shouldn't have but do. The writing is so well done, even if there's some unnecessary repetition undoubtly because of the use of a first-person narrative. It's not enough, though, to detract from the story or diminish my attention or interest.<br /><br />The third and final book in this series is beckoning and I cannot resist. This is a most interesting story and I'm reluctant to see it end.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|A fun, simple logic game, a bit like Quell, in that it's challenging, yet not frustratingly so. Love the 'undo' feature that allows you to change a move.  Works great on all my devices (Optimus V, Polaroid PTAB, Acer A500); if you have a budget tablet, try this game.  It's well worth a dollar. :-)
B006ZBRMOU|4.0|The final installment in this trilogy did not disappoint, even if it tended to meander at times.  Ana and Christian continue to work their way through his damaged past to create a healthy relationship for the two of them, despite threats to their safety and relationship.  Christian is still haunted by aspects of his past and Ana is having to mature quickly to help him and herself through her own discoveries.<br /><br />I continued to be amazed at Ana's self awareness and her ability to rise above her own insecurities to explore Christian's truths and demons.  She's an enigma that sometimes gets overwhelmed by the force that is Christian but Ana holds her own and is the key to his freedom from his past.  We are also treated to more of their email interactions, which is a brilliant device in this story to help us understand the dynamics of their relationship as they use them to really communicate their feelings.  Even when there is silence on one end, that in itself communicates loudly.  The writing is also sophisticated, with some phrasings that tell you the author is British, but that just made it more interesting.<br /><br />I worried about whether I would become bored or tire of this couple and that didn't happen.  Ana and Christian continue to evolve in unpredictable ways, even in the midst of heartbreak and tragedy in this story.  Another reviewer characterized the end of this trilogy as bittersweet and I think that's an apt description of my feelings.  I'm reluctant to let these two go as I became invested in their outcome. While there is sort of a bow tied to the end of their journey, it's a messy one, which is so befitting to them.  I'm glad I read this series and am satisfied with the final story.
B005KP7EK4|4.0|For years, the infamous `what if?' scenario has played into the themes central to hundreds if not thousands of films, books, and television programs.  Indeed, what would ABC TV's program \\"Lost\\" been without more than its fair share of `what ifs'?  It's become a bit of a gimmick for motion pictures in the last decade or so, perhaps a bit overused, but BLACKTHORN takes a swing at it and gives it another play for its worth: what if Butch Cassidy never died at the end of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and, instead, lived out the remainder of his days in quiet solitude?  While that may not seem the most glamorous spin at speculative fiction - nor a foundation for the most daring Western adventure ever - BLACKTHORN ends up being a bit greater than the sum of its small parts, and that's no doubt due in large part to the inclusion of Sam Shepard in the titular role as the aging bank robber hoping for one, great legitimate score to give him enough money to return back home before he withers away.<br /><br />It seems the Kid and Sundance didn't die when the Mexican `federales' came for them; curiously, they were able to sneak out the back, but not without the Kid suffering a fatal gunshot wound.  Once he puts his friend in the ground, Cassidy changes his name to James Blackthorn, and he takes up residence raising prize horses in Bolivia.  As luck would have it, Blackthorn learns that his and the Kid's flame from their lawless days - Etta Place - gave birth to a young man that could've been a son or a nephew, for all he knows, and the retired train robber keeps up his correspondence with the boy.  Eventually, Blackthorn wants to see his home again before he dies, so he sells off a last round of horses to a big haul of money ... only to lose it all after the fleeing accountant-turned-thief, Eduardo Apodaca (played by Eduardo Noriega), unsuccessfully tries to rob him of his horse.  In exchange for helping Apodaca avoid capture from the posse of vigilantes fast on his trail, Blackthorn will receive half of the man's haul ... if they both can survive long enough to claim it.<br /><br />Therein lies the `what if' and the cruel irony at the heart of BLACKTHORN's story: the man must embrace the kind of life he long ago left behind in order to make that last big score.  Certainly, the irony doesn't stop there, as the vigilantes not only close the distance separating them but also their identities turn out to be something that not even Blackthorn could've ever suspected.  It's a startling revelation for the man who's lived a life of hard truths, and it runs parallel to the premise as laid out by the aging robber's narration: \\"There are only two significant events in a man's life: when you leave home and when you go back. Everything else is just the middle.\\"  It seems that Butch Cassidy can never quite escape `the middle' as he so desperately wishes to do, even when that means running up against an aging Pinkerton agent (a wonderful little cameo-style role, played by Stephen Rea).  The two men are long past their prime, and, if they're not careful, Apodaca will be the death of them both.<br /><br />Frankly, it's the kind of role an actor has to wait a lifetime to play, and Shepard fills the cowboy boots to great effect.  He entirely looks the part - a tremendous asset as opposed to aging a much younger actor under layers of make-up - of Butch Cassidy with his leathered creases and wise eyes.  There's still a spark of wit in Cassidy as he trades verbal barbs with the noticeably younger Noriega, taunting and teasing the man whose life he's saved in exchange for half of the man's stash.<br /><br />As westerns go, BLACKTHORN is very solid.  It's filmed in striking locations, edited smartly, and put together in a first rate production.  All of the players - including Dominique McElligott in the all-too-briefly-seen Etta Place (she can be seen recently in AMC TV's equally entertaining oater, \\"Hell on Wheels\\") - hit their marks.  The writing is sharp, if not a bit too predictable toward the climax, which ties up a bit too neatly for my tastes.  Still, it's a winner that deserves to be seen by a wider audience, and no doubt western enthusiasts like myself will find plenty to celebrate here.<br /><br />Highly recommended.e climax, which ties up a bit too neatly for my tastes.

B0052U59F4|4.0|Anastasia Steele substitutes for her ailing friend Kate and conducts an interview with wealthy businessman Christian Grey. He's taken with her and soon insinuates himself in her life and convinces her that they belong together. Christian's definition of what that means is the crux of this story since he's idemanding that she become his submissive to his dominant.<br /><br />Initially, I struggled with this story as Christian demanded Anastasia's compliance with the dom/sub role beyond a sexual relationship. He was controlling in a most unattractive way, suffocating the young Anastasia, who has a pretty good head on her shoulders for her age. However, as this story progressed, it became abundantly clear how complex this relationship was and there was so much more to both characters than appeared on the surface and even a couple of layers down. I became enthralled by them both and even more impressed with Anastasia's maturity in spite of her inexperience. We experience events through her eyes and voice, asking the same questions that crop up in my own mind. Some of the most funny and interesting moments are the emails between these two, which I think represents the most clever dialogue I've read in quite some time.<br /><br />The book ends in a way that immediately pushes you to the next story of the trilogy. I don't mind as I am hooked by these characters. This isn't your typical BDSM story and that's a really good thing.

I wanted to write a review specificlly to those who may haven ventured here due to the hype that the upcoming major motion picture has been getting.  Even if you're not big into reading, I'm pretty confident that you'll have NO PROBLEM blazing through this book, and then Catching Fire, and then Mockingjay.  Try out this trilogy tour-de-force, you won't regret it!

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I just read this book for the second time! This is an amazingly well written book that transports you to all the remarkable locations within the story. Most authors can describe a location and setting, but Deborah Harkness has a talent for giving the reader the feel of what it would be like to be there. She also takes a topic that is written about a lot these days (witches and vampires), and gives it an original spin.  When Diana's parents are murdered while she is a young child, she swears off using her magic. Even though she comes from a powerful line of witches, she suppresses her abilities into adulthood. Diana is a gifted historian, and has worked hard to become as respected in the academic community without the use of magic. Her studious career has her currently researching at the Bodleian library at Oxford. There, during her research, she finds an enchanted manuscript thought lost to the magical world. Without realizing its full magical meaning, Diana sends the manuscript back to the stacks to be lost again.  Matthew Clairmont, an extremely old and handsome vampire, has been searching for this very manuscript the better part of the last century and a half.  He is not the only one, other witches and the eclectic daemons are also searching for this manuscript. With it being no small secret that Diana has turned her back on magic, it becomes a mystery to all how she called the manuscript in the first place. The question on everyone's mind is... can she do it again?  A Discovery of Witches would appeal to more than just supernatural fans. While all the main characters are of super natural origins, the story deals with so much more than that. A strong undercurrent is something that a lot of people ask themselves everyday...why are we here? The book also deals with Matthew's scientific study of trying to find out why the creatures are becoming endangered as humans out number them significantly. Amongst all the danger and unanswered questions, a most unlikely love blossoms. The core of this story is a thriller and the book does an exceptional job in that department too!!  To conclude, this is a wonderful story and I highly recommend it to anyone. It was spectacular enough for me to read a second time just a short year after the first reading. I have already pre-ordered the follow up and I am impatiently waiting its release!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the graphics and the amount of choices. I do wish the game would tell you when you are out of moves though.
B0038W0OIK|4.0|Overall construction and build: 10/10  Very well constructed with nicely braided wires.  It comes with extension cords to reach behind the computer, so that is a bonus.  The microphone retracts out of sight very nicely.  Sound quality: 8.5/10  The quality is very good, but not quite as good as my Sennheiser PC350s that this replaces.  I'm still trying to tweak the settings, but all in all the quality is superb.  The USB soundcard is not very good at all, my motherboard built in X-FI2 is far more superior.  I probably should have bought a regular 7H with no USB, but I wan't to give the soundcard a try.  Microphone quality: 9/10  Sounds good on Teamspeak. It's as good as my Sennheiser.  I asked other people on how I sound, and they said no different.  I do have the highest codecs enabled, so I am aware of any settings that could have been higher.  Fit and feel: 9.5/10  The cans fit very snugly on my ears. They are much smaller than my previous headset, but they do fit very well.  They also came with open air pads that can replace the leatherette ones if you need to hear your surroundings.  Overall: 9.5/10  I am very impressed with this headset, and I definitely recommend it if you can find it on sale below $90.

B0042AJ5D2|4.0|Big fan of this movie -- and guess what? -- my Italian is also awesome.<br /><br />Hence I have long wanted to own a copy of this in its original language. How's that for a purist?<br /><br />To this end I ordered the original, \\"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo\\" from Amazon's Italian site and had it imported to the U.S.  (This step proved unnecessary, as I wasn't aware that the Italian version is also being sold on Amazon's American site:  to wit, the page you're on.  The one I got from Italy is exactly the same as the one you're seeing on this page, although mine didn't come with a book.)<br /><br />Anyhow.  Here's why I'm confused.  Although these were filmed in Spain, the cast, crew, and -- excepting the principals -- most of the actors were Italian.  Weren't they speaking Italian?  I had long assumed so.<br /><br />Unfortunately, on even the best versions of this you can get in the U.S. (\\"Collectors' Edition, and so forth\\") you've still got that horrible dub, and no option to view the film in its original language, which I had long assumed was Italian.<br /><br />Well -- I hope you're sitting down for this -- the version you get from Italy, this one, has been dubbed into Italian -- even though it's in Italian!  What the heck is going on?<br /><br />And the dubbing is obvious.  The words you're hearing don't synch up with what the actors' lips are doing.<br /><br />But several questions remain:  what happened to the original audio?  What language was it shot in?  I'm mystified!<br /><br />My best guess at this point is that the crew, on the set, recorded crud audio knowing that absolutely everything would be dubbed and remixed later.  Hence the original audio for this was probably tossed.<br /><br />I wish somebody could clarify.<br /><br />By the way, although this Italian version doesn't have English subtitles or audio, one nice thing I can say is that if you turn on the Italian subtitles, they exactly, exactly match the words you're hearing.  That's nice.  I hate when you're reading something that is a slightly reworded version of what you're hearing.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|This is my first Garmin purchase, and although there were mixed reviews regarding it's features, it is serving its purpose for me while I am training for my first half marathon. I was inclined to go for a more expensive Garmin, but didn't see the need to invest $400+ in something at this stage of the game. Maybe once I become more of an experienced runner I will splurge a little on the tech stuff.<br /><br />I'm still getting used to the many features of the watch, but so far I have not had any issues with satellite connection (I live in a pretty open area) or the bezel as much as some have complained about. We'll see how things go in time and whether my review warrants an update.<br /><br />I am glad that it did come with two additional straps. I have really small wrists and have switched to the small Velcro strap for comfort and to keep the face on top of my wrist and not facing down like I had to do initially.

0439023513|4.0|After reading this book, I had a flashback to a conversation I once had with an old German woman at a bus stop. We were both tourists in Sweden and after some small talk she mentioned that she had been living in Dresden during the firebombing of WWII. I tried to press her for details, but it was clear that the mere mention of that event was opening up horrible memories for her and she couldn't bear to talk about it anymore. This was in 1995 -- 50 years after the event.<br /><br />Mockingjay is a remarkable novel, because it brings the reader deep inside the psyche of a person like that woman on the bench. Through Katniss, we are able to see a person transform from a little girl learning about the forest from her father into a woman whose nightmares are almost unbearable, and which will never go away. Most admirable is that this important lesson about the long term cost of warfare, is being directed at a Young Adult readership.<br /><br />The transformation of Katniss felt real, and it felt natural, and it felt like something that was in the plans from the very first pages of this book. I remember that when I first met Haymitch, I found his negative attitude irritating.  By the end of this book, I was left feeling like I could totally understand where he was coming from. In fact, by understanding Katniss, I even found myself finally having a better understanding of what might have driven Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain to suicide in 1994.<br /><br />I am very grateful to Suzanne Collins that she did not make this a story of a little girl transforming into a superhero. War heros are real, but even in the most justified war situation, war heroes leave the battlefield scarred for life. Collins knew this, because her own father was a Vietnam vet who had a lifetime of nightmares to contend with. The best way of honoring these people, like her father, is to depict this depressing reality of the unavoidable cost of war.<br /><br />Reading Katniss's story was so compelling that I found myself able to overlook many of the unsatisfying aspects of this book. My chief problem with these books is that as Katniss ventured further and further from her beautifully depicted home in District 12, the environment she found herself in felt less and less fully realized and more and more contrived. These gripes began in earnest with the second book, and contined with this third book. The biggest offender here is The Capitol, which is described in much more detail than before. I am sure the author has good reasons for why the city planners of The Capitol needed to fill it with booby traps. For me, the place just felt like a silly videogame, which detracted a bit from the very serious drama taking place on the streets of that city. Still, these are minor issues that I found myself able to overlook. It is only because the psychological storylines are so strong that I wish this book's description of environment was as detailed and satisfying as it was in Tolkein's Lord of the Rings, but I realize that this is an unrealistic expectation.<br /><br />I am surprised by the many negative reviews written about this book. So many detractors of this book seem to be let down by the negative tone of this book. It is interesting how these negative reviews contrast so sharply with the near universal praise the book has received from adult book critics. I do think that older readers probably have more personal life experiences to help them appreciate the negative tone of this book. Us older people understand that there are some sad memories that never go away, and that life can be worth living anyways. So, to those young readers depressed by this book, I only implore you not to despair over the fact that Katniss's life didn't turn out as nice as you hoped, but instead take heart in the fact that so many adults have embraced these books. I would venture to say that almost all of us adults who are parents have some dark corners buried in our psyche that can keep us awakeat night, but like Katniss we have all found our own ways to cope with the inevitable disappointments that life has thrown us, and for the most part we all eventually find a way to enjoy life despite all the lousy stuff that we have to step through along the way.wn ways to cope with the inevitable disappointments that life has thrown us, and for the most part we all eventually find a way to enjoy life despite all the lousy stuff that we have to step through along the way.

B005974CNA|5.0|Now that I've hooked you with the title, let me sound reasonable again.<br /><br />Granted Portnoy's a Monster Musician, but this album shows that whatever was going on with Mike Portnoy and his OCD and drinking, etc. even after the recovery from it, he needed to be gone from this band. Sometimes it's just time. I've suspected this needed to happen for a while, as I've read comments by other bands on the interwebz and I think Portnoy dominated the other personalities in this band a bit. He also built it with the force of his personality, so it's a trade-off, without a doubt.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm glad FOR Mike Portnoy as well as for the remaining members of the band. I don't know any of them personally, but if you look again at these things as something less of a fanboy and more like a human being, I think you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />If Mike needed space, I think it was wise for him to do so and I applaud him for it. Who knows what passed between them to break the relationship a bit, but sometimes you just need room in your life, and to remove certain people from it. On the other hand, sometimes you can feel that you are holding people back and as a friend, he is again, wise- if this was the case.<br /><br />Enough of that.<br /><br />This is my favorite DT album so far. It's still fundamental DT prog metal through and through, but everything has a lot more space to my ears and watching the selection process of the new drummer shows what amazingly NICE people they all are. I'm quite reassured by this fact, and makes me feel better about purchasing their music over the years. I have long had a doubt in my mind if DT were the right banner-holders for prog metal, and with this album, I will say that I've turned a corner and they've matured into that role with this album. I've always preferred the sensibility of Marcel Coenen's bands or Vanden Plas prior to this album, and while Vanden Plas has remained the same band, putting out the same music- SURPRISE!- Dream Theater really hits their stride. This is the band at the height of their powers and maturity.<br /><br />All the places where there were awkward bits in the other albums seem gone in this one. Some of their slower songs always sounded forced to my ears, but no longer. Labrie's vocals are better than ever, and the songwriting of Petrucci/Rudess can take it's rightfully predominant place in the sound. Their arrangements have also matured and gelled between all the members in a way that's subtle and appreciated by this reviewer.<br /><br />What can you say about Mike Mangini, but that you don't notice Mike Portnoy's absence. Nuff said. Watching some live videos on Youtube makes it clear the man belongs. You feel the passion in the man's playing, and I think that has created a looser feel to the band, and it shows. It's more soulful and earnest. I heard a few riffs identical to Portnoy in there (very end of Outcry), so it's clear Mangini was paying tribute also. I look forward to him as a fully contributing member of the band.<br /><br />This album sounds more hopeful and more like the personalities of the band members present than did, for example, The Dark Eternal Night. That never sounded like proper DT to me from a lyrical standpoint.<br /><br />\\"Dark\\" doesn't seem to be a place where these guys live in their mental daily lives. Happy and nice they are and it should show in their music. The Dark Eternal Night didn't do that, and I could feel the discord with that approach in the music. I loved the fact of Buddhist-style chanting in the one song, and this seems to me to be more like them.<br /><br />For me, I prefer an amazing technical musical sense in an artist who is also intelligent, hopeful, nice, polite and earnest (my key word).

0345528581|5.0|I've been on Timothy Ferriss' Slow-Carb Diet for two weeks now ([[ASIN:030746363X The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman]]). I noticed I was losing muscle along with fat, and decided to check this book out. I feel like it is very synergistic with 4HB. It goes into more of the science behind nutrition, health and body composition.  While the first part of the book (before the exercises) was the part that got me hooked on this program, its the actual workouts that are going to change my body composition. I downloaded the You Are Your Own Gym Ipod Touch / Iphone app and love it so far. It gives all of the timings and descriptions of each exercise. The perfect combination with the book. It even lets you choose your 10 week program, customize it, and track your results. I've only done two 36-minute routines so far. Both kicked my butt. I can tell that this 10 week program is going to get me in the best shape of my life.
B005COO1X6|4.0|This was a very good quick read.  Just when I thought I couldn't be surprised this book took care of that.  Maybe because I like to do road trips and will now imagine the incident in this book taking place somewhere along my travels, I might not pull over at a rest stop for awhile.  That's what Stephen King seems to do to us and I'm sure he enjoys that fact a little too much.  For the money and if you can really go out there in the belief scale, you'll enjoy this.  It made me think of a Steven Spielberg movie from the 80's but only if he took a hit of acid while writing the screenplay.
B004JY0KP8|5.0|nice-looking one and accurate. if the designer paint the hour and minute hands' edge with some colors like blue, may be much easier to read.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've been reading Stephen King since the early 80's and have read pretty much all his books and have all of the ones from the Stephen King Library.  Nobody can paint a picture of the 50's and 60's like Stephen King does with his love of the cars and music from that era.  He also shows how far we have come since then with the ignorance and prejudice of the time, although we still have a long way to go.  I was sucked in from the first few pages and enjoyed not just the idea of the time travel but what was also a true love story that I didn't know Stephen King had in him.  I won't provide anything that will be called a spoiler but will say if you enjoy the classics like The Shining, Salem's Lot, Christine, The Dead Zone, and The Stand....I put this up there with those titles.  It was probably the best money I have spent on a book in years.
B004I8WD6E|2.0|The case fits perfectly but it absorbs oil and dirt from hand and changes into a dull, translucent color. It will still serve the purpose, but if you are using the white iphone 4s, the dull color will mar the elegance of white. The screen protector is also very ordinary, nothing special.
055358202X|3.0|First of all, as a book in the series, A Feast for Crows is a mere filler.  Having grown use to Arya, Jon, Bran, Tyrion, and Dany as our primary protagonists, I was not happy that these characters combined got only 3 chapters (and those 3 were all Arya).  I could have really done without Cersei as a point-of-view character, but I guess this was the only way to know what was going on in Kings Landing.  By the end of the book, I had grown to appreciate the story-lines of Jaime, Brienne, and the various characters surrounding Doran Martell.  I was bored out of my mind by the chapters about the Greyjoys.  I really struggled through the first 120 pages or so, but after that it read more like the first 3 in the series.  Not really a bad book overall, but it just seemed a bit aimless in relation to the bigger picture.  But let me make this point.  I didn't start reading a Song of Ice and Fire until last year, and by the time I got to Crows, A Dance wtih Dragons was out.  When I finished Crows, I immediately started reading the next book (which is much more like the first 3).  Had I waited 4 years for Crows to come out, read it, and then waited another 5 years for Dance with Dragons, I would have probably lost interest and patience in the series.  If you plan on reading the entire series, A Feast for Crows is mandatory.  But if you're not sure you want to wait another 5 years for book 6, I would recommend stopping after book 3 as the 700 pages of Crows is a serious time investment that is not necessarily justly rewarded.
B004LWZWC4|4.0|So, let's look at what we have... three HUGE celebrities appearing in a title that most of us didn't even know existed! Here's the deal; if you are looking for a zany Jack Black, slapstick Steve Martin, comically smug Owen Wilson type all rolled up into a big ball of gut-busting, knee slapping laughs then this movie is not for you.  Truth is, this movie is a great film, so long as you know what to expect (a task that the film's marketing team obviously dropped the ball on; dropped it and then stabbed it repeatedly with a sharp object until it's deflated rubbery carcass lay abandoned in the tall uncut grass). The Big Year is a charming story of three men determined to win a competition that consists of spotting as many rare birds in North America within a year. Owne Wilson plays the record-holding champion hell-bent on protecting his title from two newcomers played by Martin and Black. In all honesty, the movie will make you chuckle and... get ready for this; smile. It will literally make you smile as you are drawn into the lives of these characters with a refreshing sense of realism. And another bonus; the makes a great family night movie simply because it is not your typical profanity-laced, awkward situation movie that we have come to expect from Hollywood. Outside of, maybe 2 or 3, curse words that can normally be heard on network television, you can watch this with the kiddies. If you would like a feel-good story that will even make you reflect on aspects of your own life, then you won't be disappointed with The Big Year. After all, finding a movie that feels as real as this one, well... it's like spotting something rare.

B003O86FMW|1.0|Overall I did not like this second book in the series mostly because nothing happened in the first two thirds of the book. Nothing happens. It's mostly about Katniss being torn over her love between Peeta and Gale. The plot is dull and obvious. The action in the last third of the book is great, but not good enough. I do not recommend this book at all.

B005D0RDKW|5.0|I saw some mixed reviews on this blu-ray. I have to say this concert was AWESOME to see this in Blu-Ray. I have been a RUSH fan for 30+ years and I have enjoyed all there live concert DVD's. The concerts are even better when you see them in Blu-Ray. A suggestion, when watching the Rush Time Machine Blu-Ray, have your home theater system set-up for true surround sound. don't use any theater enhancement setting like Music Video, Concert Hall, etc. It takes away the sound quality of the Blu-Ray. In true Dolby Digital Surround Sound the concert sounds great!
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|I'm not really good at writing long and complicated analytical reviews so here's the quick breakdown. It's basically the original without the suspense and otherwise awesome cinematography. Several of the scenes seem to mimic the original movie. The guy getting burned while seated against the wall, testing to see who's infected while everybody in the room eye's everybody else suspiciously, etc. Sadly the original special effects are even better. You can't mess with John Carpenter. Still made my wife jump a few times though.

0007248016|5.0|I listened to this book on CD while at work on my cubicle.  I can't imagine reading his words now after hearding them spoken by Gordon himself.  I own 4 books on CD by 3 different authors, each read by the author, Anthony Bourdain, Danny Meyer, and now Gordon Ramsay.  \\"Humble Pie\\" is by far my favorite, and most entertaining one of the bunch.  The audiobook is abridged, and only takes about 3 1/2 hours to finish.  Do it.  Do it now.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Even though her music has been floating around the net for a year and most of that ended up here - I actually like \\"Born to Die\\" more than I thought I would. It's all artifice - the music is a lush laconic illusion. But I like the retro film noir feel - it's something nobody else is doing right now.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the song \\"Kinda Outta Luck\\" didn't make the album. It's one of my favorites of hers and shows a nice sense of humor that is appreciated.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game.  Relax and enjoy.  A game that is soothing.  Music is peaceful too.  I can see why people love it.
B003VBVQKS|4.0|I read somewhere that Glenn Hughes feels the Kevin Shirley remixes give the true artist's vision of the songs. I really love Glenn but I find the remixes are subpar in every way to Disk 1/Original versions of the songs.  Disk 1 is the CTTB release and its great. On both records, the extra songs are great too and nicely compliment Days May Come and other such releases. I personally love CTTB. It's a great record, period. Deep Purple or otherwise.
1594744769|4.0|What sets Ransom Riggs' debut novel apart from other young adult fantasies is not the text but the illustrations. The bulk of them are, as an afterword notes, \\"authentic, vintage found photographs,\\" from Riggs' collection and those of other vernacular photography enthusiasts. In fact, the novel began with the pictures, which Riggs used to guide the construction of the narrative. This unconventional source of ideas lends the invented milieu a strange, slightly disjointed quality that works for the book rather than against it, creating an appropriately quirky feel that separates the book from the bulk of \\"teenager discovers magical secret\\" titles. Factor in the creation of a fairly realistic teen protagonist, and you have a title engaging enough to recommend to YA genre readers of all ages.<br /><br />Jacob Portman thought he was an ordinary boy destined to lead an ordinary life, but given the type of novel he's in that's obviously not going to last. The stories his grandfather told about a children's home in World War II era Wales and its residents with bizarre talents used to fascinate him, but now he thinks they're just a metaphor for a life lived in the shadow of the Nazi holocaust. That belief isn't destined to last either. When his grandfather dies in a horrifying way that makes Jacob wonder if it was all true, there seems to be no solution but a trip to Wales. What he finds there is even weirder than he imagined, and even more dangerous. The hidden world his grandfather alluded to is very real, and in great danger, and whether he wants to or not, Jacob has a role to play in its fate.<br /><br />All of which may sound, to those widely-read in the genre, like standard fare. What elevates it is that the fantastic elements, and the way they fit together, are less traditional. Since the novel takes its time in revealing them, a reviewer shouldn't give anything away, but they blend fantasy, science fiction, and horror in a way that doesn't feel restrained or defined by the conventions of any of those genres. It helps that even the non-supernatural elements, from Jacob's unconventional best friend to the way of life of the remote Welsh island where he makes his discoveries, are equally striking, offbeat and amusing but not clumsily or cheesily so. And the wild invention is balanced by the realistic characterization of Jacob, whose relationship with his parents is edged with authentic personality flaws and failures of communication. The first-person narration is only partly successful-- at times Jacob sounds like an ordinary teenager, at others like a writer trying to achieve atmospheric effect-- but it hits often enough to work, and witty asides (\\"my mother was loath to pass up even the flimsiest excuse for a celebration-- she once invited friends over for our cockatiel's birthday\\") help keep the prose involving and the pace lively.<br /><br />Another part of what makes the setting feel rich is that much of it remains unexplored. Only some of the peculiar children of the title have had their powers and personalities revealed, and there's a wider community of unusual types to be discovered. The ending is more of a new beginning that promises further adventures, so it's no surprise to learn that Riggs is currently gathering photos on which to base a sequel. If it puts the same distinctive spin on teen fantasy as its predecessor, it'll be a book to watch out for.f any of those genres.

1400032717|5.0|Telling this story from the point of view of a boy with autism/aspergers made it more immediate but his keen sense of observation also made the pathos of his parents situation seem somehow more tragic.<br /><br />Humor is often found in seeing something suprising and while our protagonist claimed that he could tell no jokes, he had me laughing out loud at several spots.<br /><br />I particularly liked how this ended. The other books that I've read that touch on this subject have all ended more bleakly. This one has some hopeful aspects.<br /><br />This is a great read on so many levels, I'm glad that it's gotten the attention that it has.

0307279189|5.0|I do not get excited about many books, but I really liked this one.  I was expecting a book about running but this book delivered so much more.  This book opened my eyes up to a whole new world of possibilities and did it wrapped around some very interesting stories.<br /><br />I love to run, but running does not love me.  I cannot run on roads without getting horrible shin splints, knee pain, and heel pain.  I assumed it was due to my size, 6' 1\\" and 225 pounds.  I assumed I was too big to run, most runners weigh about 150.  I was packing about 75 pounds too much muscle to run.  I would run 2-3 miles on the road and suffer, but then I noticed if I went off-road and ran on dirt trails I could log 5, 6, 7 miles without pain and feel great!  I assumed it was due to the softer surface of the dirt trails.  But then again there are many rocks on the trails and after tripping once or twice I realized they might be harder than the paved road surface.  So I figured it was all the side to side movement for foot placement that was making my runs more pain free and enjoyable.  Then I read this book and realized I run so much better on the trails because I am constantly scanning for foot placement, normally using a shorter stride, landing on my toes way more than my heels, focusing on the scenery, and just having fun and not worrying about times or distance. Were all my running injuries a direct result of my heel-striking running style?<br /><br />There are hundreds of great reviews for this book, so there is probably not much that I can add.  If you are not a runner, you may want to be after reading this book.  You will enjoy the story, which is loosely based on running, but offers a great lesson in history and evolution of modern man.  If you are a runner you will really enjoy this book.  If you are a runner plagued by injuries, you will love this book even more.<br /><br />ps:If you buy this book you will most likely end up buying new running shoes.  Not your average running shoes, but minimalist running shoes.  I picked up a pair of [[ASIN:B0052IXN0Y Merrell Sonic Glove]] and really like the way they feel.  I have run in them a number of times, and while it does take a little getting used to, the running style is much nicer.shoes, but minimalist running shoes.

1593553307|5.0|Nothing is better than the combination of a great story that is well read. The narrator of this audio-novel could not have been a more perfect fit for one of Koontz's best tales.  If you enjoy audio-novels, and especially if you don't, this is one to try.  I bought this for myself several years back, and repurchased it for a gift.  It's worth owning because you will want to experience it over again from time to time.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|To start, I thought the story was so different from anything else out there, it peaked my interest. When I went to see it at the theatre, I was blown away!! Jon Favreau did a fantastic job, cast was great, the whole thing was extremely entertaining. I go to movies to escape for a little while and this one really fit the bill.  The BluRay, DVD, Digital Copy was perfect. Universal got it right as far as the Digital Copy. A CHOICE!!! Instead of forcing Ultraviolet down our throats, a choice between Ultraviolet and a regular iTunes digital copy!!!
032180354X|4.0|A few years ago, I became very interested in Strobist techniques, primarily the use of off camera flash, the importance of lighting and learning on various positioning, the equipment used by other photographers and trying to learn as much as I can from them.<br /><br />There is no denying that among the best resources out there for those wanting to learn Strobist techniques is through David Hobby's strobist.com website and also the Strobist community forum on Flickr.<br /><br />But where a lot of people are hardcore and invested in expensive Canon and Nikon cameras, people who spent hundreds on a single flash and other equipment, I knew that for myself... I'm not quite at that level where I am confident of spending as much as these individuals have. As much as I would love to have had the top-of-the line lens, the best off camera flash and strobes, my mindset was not there yet.<br /><br />Yes, I know that may put me in the side of being a budget-conscious, fiscally conservative photographer who tends to buy speedlights from Asia for under a $100 and is always searching for the best deals on Craigslist for lenses but for now, it works for me and the more I become more confident with my photography and using off camera flash, eventually I will spend the money for a better flash.<br /><br />So, I have spent months looking at Strobist website and Strobist techniques from photographers with similar equipment on Flickr and just trying to soak everything in.<br /><br />But while perusing Flickr and looking at the work of the Strobist community, there was one person who's work caught my attention. A guy named Dustin Diaz who worked in social media as his main job but when he had the free time, each day as part of his \\"Project 365\\" on Flickr, he would go out with his camera, his Nikon flash, portable stand(s), umbrella and puts them all on his backpack and take these pretty awesome photos and post one for the day.<br /><br />And gradually overtime, seeing how his technique would improve while taking these pictures.<br /><br />Bare in mind, this guy doesn't toot his own horn that he's a great photographer, nor does even come off as one. He's just a regular guy with a busy job, married but also is passionate about photography and like hundreds of people, he took part in a Project 365 on Flickr. The goal is pretty much take a photo each day and upload one everyday for 365 days straight. But also for one to challenge themselves by trying to come up with something creative with each photo.<br /><br />And sure enough, Dustin Diaz' Project 365 inspired me. And looking at the comments from everyone, I know I wasn't the only one.<br /><br />Each day, Dustin would post a photo but would also post a second photo (and sometimes video) of how he took the shot. And I was pretty excited that he would take his time to show people how he accomplished these shots.<br /><br />Granted, Dustin had provided Strobist info. for several shots, not all and like myself and many others, we would ask him \\"how do you do that? Where did you position your flash? How this? How that? You get the picture.<br /><br />There are some photographers who are comfortable by answering people's questions, some that are just too busy to reply or just don't want to. Dustin's approach was to do more of the Strobist info. for his \\"Project 365\\" and let people how he accomplished certain photos. No egos, no promotion of he's this awesome photographer... he was just a normal guy, who experimented and got the results, good and bad. But each description was witty, fun and definitely not coming off as academic or egoist.<br /><br />And sure enough, so many people followed his work and he eventually won \\"Best Flickr Photographer of the Year\\" by Mashable Web Awards. A few of his photos would also be recommended by Flickr.<br /><br />The more he got popular, more and more people would write \\"how did you that?\\", \\"why did you do that?\\", \\"you left your flash on the streets of San Francisco by itself, are you nuts?\\".<br /><br />But after his Project 365 was completed, just to see the gradual improvement by a man using off camera flash and just taking these creative photos was inspirational. And sure, there are other professional photographers who are just as inspirational, but for me, Dustin Diaz was someone I can relate to because he was a normal guy trying to learn for himself and improve.<br /><br />And when he announced that he was coming out with a book titled \\"This is Strobist Info\\", I was excited by the news. Previously, I would have to take my iPad to areas with Wi Fi and look at his photos and his Strobist info. but now, here's a printed book that I can use as a resource.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"This is Strobist Info: Your Setup Guide to Flash Photography\\" is literally an extension of his Strobist info. that Dustin had on his Project 365 on Flickr, not the same photos but with the printed format, you would get the actual photo on the left and on the right page, the setup shot.<br /><br />The setup shot would often show his flash stand with an umbrella, the flash used and at one brightness and zoom and whether or not he used a CTO Gel to add color. He would also include the ISO, aperture, the shutter speed and the lens he used and pretty much some of the pertinent settings one would find in the exif data of a photo.<br /><br />For those familiar with Dustin's Project 365 and are familiar with his witty and comical descriptions, you can expect the same type of humor in this book. Dustin also goes into information about using speedlights, radio triggers, light stands, umbrella adapters, light modifiers, etc. Also, a few technical pages on light and inverse square.<br /><br />There are about a hundred shots with Strobist info. and once again, an extension of what he had done on Flickr.<br /><br />\\"This is Strobist Info: Your Setup Guide to Flash Photography\\" is a book that I have waited with high anticipation and for less than $15, I can easily say that it was worth every penny. Being familiar with his work on his Flickr page, it was great to have that extension of his work and seeing the Strobist info. featured in printed format.<br /><br />And I'm glad he kept things separate with newer photos for the book and past photos of his learning experience from the Project 365 on Flickr.<br /><br />But with that being said, for those not familiar with his Flickr work or have read the descriptions and is looking for a \\"Strobist\\" book may be slightly disappointed in the fact that this is not an academic book (there are many books out there by career photography professionals), it is fairly quick to go through with 100 photos featured and last, I know that it's going to satisfy everyone.<br /><br />By no means is this book meant to be the end all to Strobist info. For one, if you want the most detailed information, David Hobby's website is perfectly excellent for that and also the Strobist community site on Flickr.<br /><br />But who this book is for, is those who want to know how he accomplishes his photos? Where he positions his light stands, how many Flash units, at what zoom and what setting. Learning on what lens did he use. Learning what shutter speed and aperture was used.<br /><br />This is not a book that goes into detail of why he chose that shot and to explain why he took that shot. This is not that kind of book.<br /><br />This book is pretty much a Strobist resource for those who are wondering how Dustin Diaz accomplishes the photos he took and not asking why. Nor is he the kind of guy (like many others from the Strobist community) to answer why he took the photo in such a manner. It's his creative shot done his way and I have no care of wondering about the decisions of why he took the shot that way. There are career professionals who have books out there, who have websites and blogs that go into full detail of their photography.<br /><br />So, if you are expecting that information, \\"This is Strobist Info: Your Setup Guide to Flash Photography\\" is not that kind of book. For those wanting a more professionally written, academic style photography book, this is not that kind of book.<br /><br />But for those who peruse Flickr, typing \\"Strobist setup\\" and seeing the experiments that people have done, the tools they use to take that shot, especially for those who have been to Dustin's Flickr site, then this book is for you. It's an extensions of Dustin's Project 365 project and for his first Strobist book, I enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />And yes, I wish there were more photos featured in the book, but considering it was only $15, I would have gladly paid more if there were 200 or more shots with Strobist info.<br /><br />What would I have liked to see in the book? Possibly comments from Dustin about the photo. For example, one of the biggest questions that occur often on his comments section on Flickr are people wondering about the safety of the shot. On Project 365, for one photo, he talked about losing a clamp and a flash because it was stolen. But people wonder, are there people watching his equipment when he takes his photo in the streets somewhere in the Bay Area? If anything, perhaps a bit more discussion on the challenges of certain shots would have been nice to see.<br /><br />Granted, I know that the goal was to show a full page of the original shot and the Strobist setup shot, but perhaps having the full shot and a shot of the setup maybe smaller or cropped but with a paragraph of comments would have been nice.<br /><br />So, If anything, the \\"Setup info.\\" was great to see, but it would be nice to have those comments that we are used to reading from his Project 365 included with each (or some) of the photos. Just learning about the difficulties, the challenges and even mistakes learned, were among my favorites to read on Dustin's Project 365.<br /><br />That's part of what I was drawn to Dustin's photography and his Project 365 on Flickr. He has a laid-back, cool perspective that doesn't come off sounding too pretentious, doesn't come off as egotistical, academic or erudite on photography. Dustin is just a normal guy who is still learning, but yet sharing what he learned from his own personal experience and sharing it with the world and inspiring thousands of people.<br /><br />The guy has style, wit (which may not be for everyone) but heck, it's what makes this book so fresh because it's not banal or traditional. And this may rub some people off the wrong way. For me, I'm open to his style of wit, no matter how funny or not so funny it is.<br /><br />Overall, Dustin Diaz' first book on \\"This is Strobist Info: Your Setup Guide to Flash Photography\\" was what I wanted and got.  Setup strobist info. nothing more and nothing less. And as mentioned, it is worth the money! And for a sales price at under $15, that's darn cheap for a new photography book!<br /><br />Is it meant to be the end all of \\"Strobist\\" books? Of course not. Will it help the noob? My answer is that if you are new and use the information featured on the Strobist website, learn from the Strobist community and then apply the Strobist setup techniques as seen in this book and apply it to your setup, then yes.<br /><br />Do you have to do everything as exactly what is featured in the book? Of course not. That's part of the excitement of learning Strobist techniques, applying it to your work, your environment and trying to live within your financial means with the equipment that you have.<br /><br />As mentioned, I'm not at that point where I'm confident on spending hundreds on a several Nikon or Canon flashes (I'm still trying to get used to saving money for better glass), so these Yonguo flashes are quite fine for me right now. Do you need a top of the line camera? If you can afford it, but I'm fine with my Canon T3i. And do you have to buy Manfrotto light stands? As excellent as they are...I'm quite fine with my much cheaper Ravelli's. But what worksfor Dustin and other professionals out there is great, but definitely learn to use equipment that suits you and that is within your budget and to apply the techniques you see in Dustin's book (and other sources) to your Strobist experiments and photo shoots. If anything, learn from that experience.<br /><br />With the Strobist website, the Strobist community forum on Flickr and other books from professionals out there are fantastic sources for information! But if you are looking for a book with setup shots such as what was featured on Dustin Diaz' Project 365 on Flickr, then you will enjoy \\"This is Strobist Info: Your Setup Guide\\".<br /><br />I spent a lot of time perusing photos with a Strobist setup and information with the finalized shot and Dustin Diaz has inspired a lot of us through his learning experience and sharing that Strobist experience with those who follow his work.

B000JQU1VS|5.0|Not much to say about this book,except it's deserving of the label of \\"classic\\".I remember reading this when I was a boy,and being fascinated with Holmes and Watson's exploits,and the methods of the quirky resident of 221-B Baker Street....another must read...when I saw it was available as an E-Book,I snapped it up...

076790382X|5.0|What type of writer is Bill Bryson?  Is he a historian, a travel writer, a humorist, a linguist or something else?  Actually, he's all of these things, and more importantly, he's good at what he does, as demonstrated yet again in I'm a Stranger Here Myself.  Bryson grew up in the United States in the middle America state of Iowa (much of which is detailed in his very funny The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid.  Upon reaching adulthood, he moved to England and a score of years later, he returned to his home country, taking up residence in a small New Hampshire town.  (I believe since then, he's gone back to the U.K.)  This book is a collection of columns that Bryson wrote for a British periodical which focused on the culture shock of returning home after a long period of time.  Each of the 70 essays within averages four pages and covers a lot of different topics.  Among them:  complicated tax forms, renting cars, buying coffee and flying on airplanes.  Much of the material you may have seen jokes about before, but not with Bryson's adept writing.  On the most basic and essential level, this book succeeds.  It made me laugh out loud, not for the first time with a Bryson book.  While some of his books are informative, teaching us of the quirks of the English language or the life of Shakespeare, this one is pure humor.  You won't learn much, but you'll laugh, and that, in itself, is a nice thing.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|A great toy that is always fun to pick up. When people come over and see it, it makes for a great conversation piece because they always want to know what it is. Because it's challenging, you'll get your money's worth in how long you'll use it!

B004EBZX6W|4.0|I have mostly good things to say about this app...very detailed information on wi-fi connections,signal strength meter is pretty cool...only thing I wish..is that it was more of a wi-fi detector,not just an analyzer..I got this hoping that it would be  able to help me find available networks to connect to...but it only works if you are already connected..the only reason I give it 4 stars,instead of 5...if you are looking for a tool to help you find better coverage,of an existing wireless network,this may be just what you need...but it's isn't a wi-fi detector...sorry...I should have read the description more closely..but I still like it...

0307593312|5.0|One of the single greatest books I have ever read. I highly recommend it, even if it is a long read.
0385344228|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. The premise just seemed so good: long time prosecutor in a small upper middle class suburban town finds himself in a position of having to defend his own teenage son against a murder charge. Seriously, does it get any better than this?  I wish it did. The story is told through a series of court transcripts (can we say D R Y???) and narrative, and the major problem comes down to foreshadowing. I understand this is a tool some authors use, and I also understand it can be used very effectively. However, Mr. Landay does not use it effectively here. Rather, he uses it in ways that reveals where the story is going and \\"who dun it.\\" At the same time, Mr. Landay is attempting to bring in a defense of a supposed \\"murder gene,\\" where if some one's ancestor's have murdered, then that individual is more likely to murder. By the time the trial starts (almost halfway through the book) if a reader is in anyway good at solving mysteries, they will know who did as the author will have given it away. Dull, dull, dull!!  Oh, but the author does leave a \\"twist\\" at the end for readers who think the only exciting thing about this book is solving the murder. The problem is, the twist is, well, anti-climatic and not very effective, in my opinion.  I really did not like the characters in this book, and that also added to my dislike. Andy Barber, the main protagonist, is supposed to be a crack prosecutor. However, when it comes to his own son being accused of murder, he suddenly buries his head in the sand as if none of the screaming red flags make any sense. One wonders exactly why this guy ended up the #1 ADA for this county, when he seems to act so out of character. Jacob Barber, Andy's son who has been accused of murder, seems to be such a reclusive nerd with such an attitude problem, it's difficult to see how neither parent could have seen this before the incident, yet could afterwards.  And the biggest thing that was never made clear to me in this book? Jacob Barber is 14 years old, in Middle School. He is brought up on murder charges, and is sitting in a regular courtroom, in front of a jury. (Juvenile offenders never have juries) Huh?!?! 14 years old and being tried as an adult for capital murder, when he had no previous record of anything? Really?? I could see if he was 16 or 17, but 14? That was really just too much for me.  I know this is a work of fiction, and I can appreciate that. However, I feel as the author could have spent more effort in making this story seem real, and I don't think it would have taken all that much. I was expecting a really good story. I experienced a let down.
0307949486|1.0|I started reading this book with high-expectations given the hype surrounding it. I guess I'll never learn my lesson - don't fall for the hype. How refreshing it was to see I'm in good company with many Amazon reviewers who rightly gave this 1 star.<br /><br />The title would lead you to believe the book was centered around this mysterious character with the tattoos, and at first it seems this will be the case. It's not. Salandar (The Girl With...)is very intriguing at first, but than it all falls apart as Mr. Larsson focuses on Blomkvist - a stereotypical character who is totally unbelievable as he jumps in bed with all types of girls. He is sleeping with his co-worker, co-founder (Berger) of their magazine, Millenium, who is also happily married and splits her time between Blomkvist and her hubby. And all three in the love triangle are ok with this. Give me a break! Later in the book Berger finds him in bed with another women and is not the least bit bothered by it. Are you kidding me? No man or women wouldn't be totally jealous. It just didn't ring true for me.<br /><br />The book jumps from place to place to try and build suspense, but there is way too much of that in my opinion, and it becomes frustrating to follow.<br /><br />The characters are thinly developed and often times say and act out of that character.<br /><br />This book quickly threw weird sex into the fold and that's when I began to lose interest. It was just so blatant and unbelievable and just not good.<br /><br />There are flashes of brilliance in this book, but perhaps something was lost in translation.<br /><br />Again. It was very disappointing. I feel ripped off by the misleading title. Thanks for nothing, editors.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is very much the same game that millions of people been wasting countless hours on, ever since the dawn of the digital age. There are a few key features, such as being able to pick a winning deck, make this a perfect time waster. Thus, the esteemed tradition of skilled laziness continues!
B002K0WBYG|1.0|BUYER BEWARE!  I purchased this Blu-Ray because I thought it came with a digital copy of the movie so I could watch it on my iPad.  What Amazon's description of what you are getting fails to mention is that the digital copy code included with the DVD has expired and the company behind those codes will not issue a new code, I've tried.  I am now working on getting a refund.  Please note that my review does not reflect the movie itself but the contents the movie claims to come with.  I loved the movie.
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|Must have for Floyd fans. This is another one in a series of brilliant Floyd albums. I was mildly disappointed that the CD was not shipped in a jewel case (cardboard) but that was OK. The music was worth every penny of the price.
0439023521|5.0|I grabbed this from the library on a day I happened to be sick in bed, and wound up reading the whole thing in one day. Its a very compelling, page turning read. Thoroughly enjoyable for me as an adult, though I can also see why a YA audience would enjoy it. Yes, there's a lot of violence, and a dystopia feel ( though theres never really anything resembling a utopia to begin with), but the main character goes through an amazing range of experiences, in the process perhaps remembering how to actually feel (even if that means grappling with complex and confusing emotions, something any teen can relate to).
B005HSL626|5.0|this app is awesome! I can't get enough! I'm working on getting all the backgrounds and blades! go fruit ninjas!
B004SBBDB2|1.0|This product is very vague about what it actually works with.  I tried using it with my iPhone 4S running 5.0.1 and nothing seems to work.  The TV seems to freeze like it's going to switch over from the input screen but doesn't.  The screensaver saying 'Device Not Connected' actually freezes on my Samsung TV.  Youtube, Safari, Music and even Video do not work.  I did occasionally get a still image from Netflix but the controls lock up on the iPhone so you can't actually do anything.  Tried dropping back to the app screen then restarting the app...  clicking Settings then going back...  even tried restarting the iPhone a couple time.  No go.  click widescreen on and off...  sometimes video and youtube works.  sometimes doesn't...  I think swearing at it does help though.  It did seem to work with my old 2G Touch.  Although it only worked with Video and Youtube.  I bought it for use with the 4S though.  I did try the USB and the TV recognized the device but showed all of the folders empty.  When using the Touch, it worked a little better and displayed the pictures that were stored on the device.  It says it's supposed to work with the iPhone but with all of the OS updates and phone generations, it may have worked with the older phones at one time.  I don't know what to say about it other then I'm returning mine.
1416955070|1.0|This book is just terrible. Hard to believe, hard to feel for the characters, unoriginal, and overall childish. Maybe teenager might love this and therefore the good reviews and the sales but if you are over 30 and you are thinking that this might be like the Twilight Saga or The Wheel of Time or Ice & Fire, think twice.
B0014NDXGA|1.0|When my Bushnell Tour V2 was working properly it was just great. Then suddenly, the readings are about 10% low.  My friend has one and his readings remain accurate.  So I go on the Bushnell web site. No help in solving the problem - very little tech support info.  So I called them.  Well, that didn't work either. They are closed for a two hour company meeting. Seriously?  I hope that meeting wasn't about improving the customer experience.

0955153077|5.0|This is the most comprehensive guide to painting in photoshop that I have read thus far. From setting up your workspace, to learning the fundaments of design, to developing your own style; this book has it all. It even has a section for techniques for painting common things such as clouds, fire, grass, and metal. For the price it is the only photoshop painters guide. Highly recomended.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|Last night my wife and I watched the prequel to John Carpernter's The Thing and really enjoyed it. We originally saw it in the theaters and then bought it last night on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />There's been a lot of talk about Carpenter's film not being \\"the original.\\" We are all aware of the 1951 film. However, the 1951 version has almost nothing to do with the novel with which it is supposedly based on (Who Goes There?)whereas the '82 version stays overall faithful to the book.<br /><br />So, in the context of this film being a prequel to Carpenter's film and NOT the '51 film, it does indeed make Carpenter's \\"the original.\\"<br /><br />When Kurt Russell discovers the base in the '82 version, it is in shambles and deformed, burnt bodies are found. (As well as one human body) The creator's job of the new film is to paint the picture of what actally happened at that base before Kurt arrived.<br /><br />One can see that they took extreme care to try and recreate the scene to be as close as it could be to the '82 version. From the room \\"The Thing\\" was stored in to the axe in the door to the obvious ending, everything was explained at least to my satisfaction.<br /><br />Was it perfect? No. A little too much CGI? Maybe. Did they do a great job? Yes. Any normal fan of the '82 version should enjoy this as well.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I ordered this thinking I would get the cover in white, however it came in black, which is not my favorite color.  But too expensive to send back for just that reason.  I watched the video when I ordered and followed it when I put the Kindle Fire in, very easy to use, seems to be well made and feels okay, at least it will not slip out of my fingers. It is very lightweight and does not add additional weight to the Kindle, which is important if you are playing a game or reading.  Since I just received it and have not used it, I will not be able to say how it will function or if it will last.  I will update this review once I have used and abused it for awhile.

0553801473|1.0|I love the first four books: very entertaining fantasy novels, showing ambition, intrigue, ruthlessness and cruelty in a medieval society and adding suspense by creating a mysterious threat in the North. Especially the relations between the Lannisters, the Starks and the Tyrells and the machinations of Littlefinger, Varys and Renly were highly entertaining. Sure, Daenery's travels were a little bit pointless but I was ready to be surprised how she will be converged into the Westeros plot in the end (and was hoping for her destiny to be similar to Mary's, Queen of Scots).<br /><br />And now look a this mess called a Dance with Dragons. Obviously the author wanted to show us that<br /><br />1. Little Miss Dragon is a teenager with the typical confused state of mind (and hormonal balance) of a very young woman,<br />2. Jon Snow is a confused \\"reformer\\", his ideas are unconventional and therefore not very popular,<br />3. Tyrion is confused both in his relations to women and his family.<br /><br />All this psychologial confusion could work out fine if Mr. Martin were as good a writer as Thomas Hardy or Fjodor Dostojewski. He is not, of course. What worked with Jaime's character in FFC reasonably well, could not be repeated in ADWD. Whenever one of the main characters in ADWD starts \\"thinking\\" or \\"feeling\\" in an everlasting repetitive course, the reader is bored and emotionally detached.<br /><br />At some point Mr. Martin must have realized his failure because he added several new or resurrected dead characters just to create some action and story development. Unfortunately, these characters are one-dimensional and/or their actions are implausible (e.g. the ridiculous Sand Snakes, both princes). However, the other characters who are not given the explicit pseudo psychological treatment think and act in incomprehensible ways:<br /><br />For example, it would have been interesting to read some thoughts from ANY point of view on how Miss Dragon will be accepted in the Westeros society - just imagine the most developed society in the world being invaded by a bunch of strange creatures from the back of beyond, lead by a teenage girl with a perception of entitlement and dragons which lay waste to large parts of the country? Cersei who is so paraonoid regarding her son's position, does not even think about all the rumors from Essos? Cersei, whose late husband was intent to kill Miss Dragon because in his opinion she was a major threat? The oh-so-sensible Ser Barristan does not think once an invasion could be a bad idea for his homeland?<br /><br />Is Mr. Martin sure he writes fiction for adults or is this just true for the scenes involving sex and violence which unfortunately reach a disgusting level in ADWD, obviously written for cheap thrills?<br /><br />So, the really interesting conflicts are not solved and hardly or never mentioned (Littlefinger's revelations to Sansa regarding the murder of Jon Arryn, Brienne's, Jaime's and Sandor Clegane's destiny, what about the Tyrells' intentions and actions). Instead, another character has to die, and another, and another has to be resurrected - obviously to make room for a completely new story because Mr. Martin is not able to create a smooth braid from all these loose threads dangling around.<br /><br />Do not read this book if you liked the previous four. Do not read this book if you are emotionally attached to any of the main characters from books 1-4, their development is either not mentioned or boring.<br /><br />I will stop reading this series because there will be no satisfactory ending (there cannot be because too many interesting characters like Tywin L. are killed off already or were maneuvered into a dead end like Cersei L. or Loras T.). And to reach the end, at least three more books will be necessary. I am really sorry I wasted my money on the hardcover edition of this book.<br /><br />I just hope HBO will take major liberties with the book and make a decent story with an end after 4 seasons.

B005HSL626|3.0|I love this game. my dad originally got it for app of the day on android. I played it and loved it, so I got it for my Kindle Fire. I didn't want to pay, so I got the free version. I don't like the adds, but that aside its a great game. I reccomend.
031219126X|5.0|This book is a classic in literature and this publication offers great additional material. I used this text for a college course and found it extremely helpful. If you are like me and struggle with some styles of writing, try listening to the audio book while reading the text. I've done that for this book and some of Jane Austen's novels and it has helped me get into the story more and has allowed me to get more out of reading the book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's so handy to have books with you at all times. The phone is easier to take with you than either the Kindle or Ipad, I wasn't sure I would like reading on such a small screen but it hasn't seemed to bother me at all, now if the airplanes wouldn't make us shut off the phone for take off and landing it would be even better.
1439102732|1.0|I have read other jp books and was very much looking forward to reading this one. sadly,  the writing was poor, immature seeming, the characters totally unrealistic and story line was contrived.  it was like the author thought of 3 personal/political points she wanted to make and wrote an uninspired, unrealistic, sophmoric story in order to make her three points.  The main political rant was gay rights/marriage which i am --FOR-- already.  but the Christian demonizing and conservative bashing throughout the book was beyond offensive.  If it hadnt been so thrown together and (again) contrived, i could have viewed it as a story instead of a personal/political rant that it is. Furthermore, the book jacket doesnt even hint at what the poor, unfortunate reader will be subjected to!  i just wanted to be entertained, to relax and enjoy the precious little time i have available to read for pleasure.  instead, i didnt finish it and returned it for a refund.  i didnt even know you could return a book! this will be the last book i purchase or read of hers.
B0053O89WY|5.0|i love this show it funny gr8, the chacacters r brilliant they all different yet all come together so well keep this show going. my children also enjoy the show and cannot wait 4 season 5 here in oz
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|It is great and comes with a mini-poster! I totally recommend this for you. The shipping is pretty good. Arrived in two days. If you are a BTR fan this is awesome.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|There are not enough good things that I can say about this trilogy..I completely devoured all 3 book in 5 days... I could not get enough of Fifty..I was even dreaming about him!! I loved the story from the beginning, I really like a book with a more realistic feeling and not all super cute and rainbows. I cried, I laughed and thouroughly enjoyed the characters and their story from the beginning. I will definitely be re-reading these!
B003UMW68Y|5.0|The Nightmare Before Christmas is exquisite on Blu-ray.  It looks so much better than a regular dvd, my daughter loves watching this movie.
B0064NTZJO|2.0|I bought the Blu-Ray at Target today based on several Best of 2011 lists.  I watch mainly old films, but from the reviews I read this seemed interesting.  The film started well, the chase after the pawn shop robbery was very well done, and Ryan Gosling was good in the role.  I have several problems with the movie though..............  The film is too long..................this is an 85 minute story told in 100 minutes.  The violence is cartoonish..............too bad Peckinpah is not around to helm films like this.  I cannot see Albert Brooks as a gangster lol............does not work for me.  Who picked those songs.......just terrible!  LOL  A Bernard Hermann score is what this film needed.  Too bad he ain't around.  I hate films that pretend to be art films when they are actually genre films...............great genre films are great art...see Hawks, Wilder, and Ford.  I hate opaque endings to a basic crime film!!  Dead or Alive??  Please.  Not Recommended.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|There are MORE than enough reviews to give you an idea of what the book ( [[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]] ) is about. MY review is for you macho guys sneeking a peek to see what real men think of it.<br /><br />It's really good. The writing kept me reading and even wanting to turn the pages. As for any girly-romance crap, it's minimal or non-existant and all but made fun of by a tough little gal (protaganist/hero) forced to fend for herself and family in the wilds and then in the games.<br /><br />The book should appeal to any of you guys who may like to escape in mild Sci-Fi, Hunting, Survival, War Stories, Post-Apocalyptic and even Fantasy fare, without all the pat cliches and tag lines that are copied by so many authors now.<br /><br />The narrative is VERY well done, has enough little twists and bends to keep you from second-guessing the action or plot line and the author created a page turner. Gets you into the head of the kid so you can understand her even when she's obviously clue-less about the relationships around her.<br /><br />My wife got me the Kindle Touch after New Years (2012) to be able to read while traveling around on my motorcycle. This was the first book I downloaded because it had hundreds of reviews and was \\"free\\" via the trial Prime that came with the E-book.<br /><br />For me (especially for free) it was WELL worth the price and time I spent to read it.
0439023521|5.0|This book was fantastic! I am a slow reader because I have to deliberate over every word and punctuation mark, but I read the whole trilogy in three days! Order right now! This is a MUST read!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Like acquiring a taste for old blues, Lana Del Rey's vocal style is one that grows on you. She has an understated tone and conveys a sense of longing and alienation.  Her lyrics are arguably more original than those found in most pop songs. They have the feel of a journal entry, which generally works for her, although at times better than others. Also, they seem generally less offensive than most pop lyrics, although the F-bombs in \\"Radio\\" would be one exception.  As for her look (as a fan of Lauren Bacall's 1940s look) I like Lana Del Rey's retro look on the album cover and inside jacket. For a change, it's nice to see a female artist with a feminine look - no weird hair, leather, or visible tattoos.  So if you are like me and find yourself mostly bored with classic rock or oldies radio, try this album. It has a unique charm.
0062082353|5.0|What's up with all the single star ratings for this book? This book is awesome! It reads quickly and provides a first person account of the war. Chris is humble, tells it how he remembers it and never claims to be the biggest badass in history. He is just explaining what he did and he explains it in a very humble manner as far as my opinion goes. He dips, trains hard, loves, kills and is passionate about everything he does. This is one of those books that sucks you in to reading one more chapter everytime you pick it up. If you are an over the top anti-war activist or a my-way-or-the-highway peace activist you probably wont like the book but I am sure the author's feelings would be mutual.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|How on earth is Drive not at least nominated for best picture? Wasn`t the whole reason of having ten nominations to include the best of the movies the mainstream public actually saw. It is not just my opinion that this film is amazing; both Ebert and Travelers gave it three and a half out of four. Also, Gosling gives a jaw dropping performance as the unnamed protagonist whose calm, collected demeanor turns violent when his neighbor and her son are threatened by organized crime. To make things worse, the academy is screwing over Gosling again by not giving Ides of March a nomination. Seriously, what does this guy have to do to get some attention? GREAT CAMERA SHOTS,JUST AMAZING MIND BLOWING MOVIE!<br />I Bought this Masterpiece on BLU-RAY, This is a movie wanna watch again & to keep  in ur collection A
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I've yet to find an Eric Church song that I dislike. His songs are diverse enough that I never get sick of them, and I've been listening for four months. I also love how he nicely inserts aspects of Christianity into his lyrics. The three albums that I purchased here are the second set. I love his music that much. Mr. Church, I applaud you and your talent. May God continute to bless you, sir!
B0055Q5F36|4.0|The \\"Otterbox Commuter Series Case\\" for my Samsung Galaxy S II is working out fantastically.  Pros:    - It only adds a few millimeters in thickness and width to the phone so it still slips in and out of my pocket with ease. Since i don't use a holster, this was a key element for me in buying this case.    - The combination of the hard/soft sections of the case are a great feature. Having the soft rubber on the corners, I've noticed, holds it steady on a surface if it's just sitting by me. This is a plus for me as it means my phone won't go sliding off a table if the table gets bumped, or what have you. It also works to cushion falls, as long as the phone doesn't fall flat on it's face or back.    - The screen protector has a good feel to it and can be lifted and repositioned a few times as needed to get it in the correct alignment with the phone's dimensions, but....  Cons:    - Unfortunately, I couldn't successfully get the screen protector on the phone without collecting dust and air pockets under it. If you're in a very clean, dust free environment, it should be fine. As a result, I decided to just scrap the screen protector, and that's actually worked out ok.    - The rubber gel part of the case tends to collect lint from my pocket, especially from jeans. This means I'm constantly trying to rub the lint off my phone's case. Not an issue with the case per se, just something to think about.  Overall:    Great case, it's done its job in protecting my phone on several instances already where I have dropped it. Took off a star because I can't accurately judge the screen protector, and it is a part of the product. I would recommend this case, though, to any one looking for a nice, slim, protective case for a Samsung Galaxy S II.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|i am a die hard fan of rick riordan and thoroughly enjoy his kid books. this book is worth reading if your a fan too. it contains the usual humor and diverse good and bad characters. however the plot was soso and didnt seem quite as exciting as percy jackson. still...there contained plenty of creativity and history which made it interesting. this book is good. but it wasnt one that i was dying to continue reading. im hoping that the next one in this trilogy well be better.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Awesome game I love it best game I have on my kindle at first I was like $1.99 for a game but after I played it its totally worth $1.99.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|Great movie for the whole family, grandparents included.<br />Has a plot, a moral and great dialog, even though it is an annimation, it is a good movie for all to see.
B00005JKNF|3.0|I suppose this is a wonderful movie but I'm not sure because I CAN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD THE ACTORS ARE SAYING.  The voices are quite muffled (I'm 40, so don't think I use a hearing aid or an ear horn).  I can't even understand what Stephen Fry or Helen Mirren are saying, and I'm big fans of theirs.  Disappointing.  I feel like I'm not in on the big joke.
B004ZJZQJC|5.0|I watched this movie a few years on cable and then saw it available, well I had to have it and the blu-ray makes it all the worthwhile........It is a great watch, a great movie and I recommend everybody who loves a fantasy to purchase this..............you won't be disappointed.......

B002YIGI52|5.0|I have always felt that Sade was its own genre, and \\"Soldier of Love\\" continues this form. The woman is in a mature mode here, telling tales in which her older fans are sure to find resonance. The title track's drum beats are unique in their \\"start/stop\\" time signature with Ms. Adu's seasoned, sumptuous alto voice answering in the simple, elegant phrasing which is her style. Most of the songs are more laid back, but go down like butter and stand up to repeated plays. There is a bittersweet mystery behind \\"Morning Bird\\", as she compares a loss to \\"The harvest of my dreams...The ghost of my joy.\\" Haunting strings and piano usher in this stark, beautiful ballad. A joyful pulse full of the promise of new life propels \\"Babyfather\\", a slow-dance ode to what a good father's love can mean. \\"Long Hard Road\\" is another string-filled entry in her hard times songbook, appropriate for the times. She reminds us to listen to the voice inside that says \\"It's gonna be alright.\\" \\"Be That Easy\\" has an almost country ballad feel, a gently swaying cuddle of a song where she recalls the easiness of a new love in light of changes. \\"Bring Me Home\\" picks up the pace with an even starker picture of a world-weary soldier of life. \\"In Another Time\\" finds an older woman consoling a young, heart-borken girl in a soulful ballad with the line: \\"They don't know what to do with something so good.\\" A sweet, high violin and sax kiss away the tears. \\"Skin\\" is more like the steamy,erotic torchiness of Sade's earlier work, even though she's saying goodbye, washing off a love that doesn't feel right. The bass and kick drum are sure to rattle a few sub-woofers. More acoustic guitar begins \\"The Safest Place\\" as it does with several of the tracks, yet another soft ballad with a beautiful string section. Our heroine has, at last, found a safe refuge from love's battlefield in the pastoral promise of her own heart.<br />In a lesser artists hands, these songs would feel contrived and phony. But the honesty of Sade's lyrics and delivery assure more than just another R&B fantasy. She has LIVED these songs, and the band lives with her as one.s lyrics and delivery assure more than just another R&B fantasy. She has LIVED these songs, and the band lives with her as one.
6304806418|1.0|This review says it must be 20 words longs...

Outside of Banderas singing \\"what A Circus\\"<br /><br />Madonna as usual is a star without any talent, both physical and vocally and yet she was reached the pincale of success.<br /><br />My copy of this film goes directly to the garbage, it's not worth the space on my shelf.
0439023491|5.0|This book was amazing. Collins has matched the first book in the serries with this sequel. Through the twists and turns that make this book so good you can't put it down, you will fall in love with the characters, and fall in hate with the bad guys. With the backlash action from the hunger games, Katniss tries to survive as a vitor. And it seems that even though she has returned to the 12th district, home will never be the same as it was before the day she volunteered to save her sisters life. A truly captivating read, that i highly recomend to anyone in need of a book.

074325144X|5.0|I've been an off-again on-again runner for years, years! I'm 46 years old, and have never been what one could call an athlete... until this book! Using the principles found in Chi Running, I have discovered how to make running work for me. I'm still a mom-of-many, middle-aged, and busy with a crazy career, but I can also add RUNNER to the list.  What I like about this book is that it shows you through language and picture how to hold your body so that you don't injure yourself while running. Before reading this book, I would get shin splints, a sore back, and tight hamstrings. I was a mess! Now I run with ease, and though I'm slow, I am healthy and strong.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I love this thing, it works like a champion. Small, compact perfect for sharpening knives or axes in the field. Worth every penny. I've owned this for about a year and used it in the field many many times. Don't hesitate to buy this product. It is very small, so you need to be careful sharpening large knives or tools, and get the hang of it. I've sharpened fishing knives and a couple of machetes to razorblade sharpness with this thing.

B005ZUR724|5.0|So I read the bad reviews, a lot of them have to do with some update or patch breaking the game. I haven't had any problems with the game, in fact it works great! Its a lot of fun, picking up quests and getting awesome gear, all while sitting on the couch.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|This is one of the most unrealistic books if read in a long time not to mention a terrible influence on young readers. Do people have to be smoking, fighting, drinking, cursing every second of the day? These characters are so one demential and trashy. I kept reading in hope of some small improvement but got none the plot in fact became more and more demented an unrealistic. ill save you the money and tell you all you need to know in  a few sentences. trashy girl goes to college meets trashy guy they smoke, have sex and drink  then real shocker they get married and all this in just a few months.

B001EN71CW|4.0|Firefly on Blu-Ray is a good upgrade over the DVD counterparts.  The packaging is thin, light, and holds 3 discs with no inserts or episode guides.  The picture quality is good, not perfect, but very good, and the sound is superb and is a very good improvement over the DVD.  The show is excellent and is well written and should have never been canceled.  If you have never seen this and are a sci-fi fan then this is a must buy just don't forget to get the Blu-Ray of Serenity also.

B0025KVLUG|4.0|I suspect that people that don't care for this particular album have never seen The Yellow Submarine movie.

B005C9YZIW|5.0|Planet Earth on Blu-Ray is simply amazing.  It is a perfect nature documentary and is best when viewing the original with narration by David Attenborough.

This is a great buy and a stunning addition to any Blu-Ray collection.
0300176147|5.0|I originally got this book for my young niece, but once I started reading, it was hard to tear myself away.  In contrast to a typical \\"dry\\" history book with facts and dates, this book's style was extremely engaging. Gombrich did not shy away from using the first person and second person, and that made the style feel very interactive. For example, the section on Alexander the Great included, \\"His commands could now be said to reach all the way from the Nile to Samarkand. This would probably have been enough for you or me, but Alexander was far from satisfied.\\" More importantly, Gombrich liberally inserts his own unique interpretations of the key takeaways, which add to the charm and coherence of the book. I loved that the book interprets rather than just relates. For example, he concluded his Bronze Age section with, \\"They were people just like us. Often unkind to one another. Often cruel and deceitful. Sadly, so are we. But even then a mother might sacrifice her life for her child and friends might die for each other. No more and no less than often than people do today.\\" This also illustrates the author's ability to relate ancient events and people to modern people and current practices.  In fact, what amazed me about the style is that it managed to be conversational and dynamic but the author was still able to seamlessly integrate profound observations and sweeping statements. One of my favorite sentences was the description of the Spartans and the Athenians: \\"Knowing how to die like that isn't easy. But knowing how to live is, perhaps, even harder.\\" Nonetheless, the grand generalizations were balanced by carefully selected details which made the history come to life. Also, even though a lot necessarily had to be left out for this to be a \\"little\\" history, the details that were put in seemed just right. Although there are many examples of these, I particularly liked the story included in the Alexander section which related how Alexander went to see the philosopherDiogenes and was so impressed that he said \\" ` If I weren't Alexander I should like to be Diogenes. ` \\" In addition, the writing had a subtle sense of humor that made me smile as I read certain parts.  Another great thing about the book is the organization. It is split up into forty relatively short chapters, and even the chapter titles seem well thought out and incorporate a touch of poetry. Each chapter starts with some creative introduction to get the reader interested in the topic, but seems to come full circle at the end. The chapters seamlessly build on top of one another and the book felt very well integrated. I was also impressed by the way Gombrich would smoothly shift into the point of view of whatever people he was discussing while not hesitating to criticize them where needed. It felt like he really made a lot of effort to consider different perspectives and show multiple sides to each story.  Finally, it would be impossible to complete a review of the book without noting the attractiveness of the book itself. The relatively \\"squarish\\" shape of the pages, the interesting effect of the half-cover in the front, the glossy paper, the fonts, and the frequent illustrations gave the book a very luxurious feel and amplified the pleasure of reading. I also greatly enjoyed the illustrative maps.  While I suppose it could be said that the book was not entirely objective, may contain a few factual inaccuracies, leaves a lot out, and gives a disproportionate amount of attention to European history, I feel that none of these are really relevant criticisms of this particular book. The lack of complete objectivity added to the charm of the book. I'm sure the engaging style of the book more than outweighs any mistakes in detail or omissions as it makes the topic so interesting that it really encourages readers to research the topics in more depth. And while I believe the argument that a balanced view of history beyond European history is important for people to have, this particular book was clearly told from Gombrich's perspective and he did a great job covering the areas he did focus on.

When my monitor went out recently I used this app in combination with my kindle fire and my Pc keyboard and mouse to surf the web with no problems. I highly reccomend it!<br />I just came back to subtract a couple of stars.  When travelling I can never get connect to my pc with it.  It works great around the house but that's it.  I'm amending my previous review which you'll see above on 6-23-13 because I could never access this app on my kindle fire away from home.  It worked great around the house, but it kind of defeats the whole purpose of taking your pc with you if you have to stick around the house to use it.<br />I have since discovered another app called jump desktop which works securely and safely anywhere you go.  As long as there is wifi to hook into I'm good.  Now with the newer kindles you don't even need wifi, but I still have the original kindle fire which serves me fine.  I'm including the link to jump desktop which unfortunately is $9.99 but I lucked out and picked it up when it was the free app of the day, and I'm glad I did![[ASIN:B0070DOHQS Jump Desktop (RDP & VNC)]]

B000BJ7BCK|4.0|So I love this movie and I never thought I would admit that. My wife and I try to watch it whenever its on. So after she got me a Kindle Fire for Christmas I smacked myself and said duh - I've been looking everywhere for this movie and I never thought to check Amazon. So low and behold there it is. So I order it and it came in a few days, problem was that the packaging was damaged as was the case. Thankfully the DVD was intact and works great! Thanks!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie will change many lives as it tells a story of men and women who are strong in their Christian lives and faith.

B005RYF5JA|2.0|Like most of the reviewers here, I caught this one on PBS and recorded it on my DVR.  Watched it with my parents of course, but unfortuantely, I just couldn't quite connect on the song choice as with the others.  I mean, it was ok even though I don't have this particular DVD to go along with the other ones I already got, but the songs themselves just didn't have the spark like before.  Overall, I just wasn't really happy with this one, and decided not to buy it.  Ah well, better luck next year.

B006OFN0SE|3.0|\\"J. Edgar\\" is a biographical drama film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Hoover.  There is no doubt that there are aspects of Hoover's life and career that are highly concerning and controversial. However, this film focuses too heavily on the negative facets, and the lack of balance in this movie damages its credibility.  I don't dispute that Hoover was at times unethical and egotistical but who really knew him? His mother, Clyde Tolson, and Helen Gandy were the qualified experts of Hoover, yet it doesn't appear that their superior knowledge of his demeanour, idiosyncrasies, life and career philosophy have been captured sufficiently for the purpose of accurately representing Hoover. All of these people are now deceased and without their input any interpretation of Hoover can only be considered as partially complete.  Hoover does deserve some credit for the centralisation of laws and regulations by pushing for them to be federally binding, and it certainly makes sense for example that the deaths of federal officials fall within the FBI's jurisdiction, which was one of Hoover's later contributions. In the film Hoover was given some credit for the Federal Kidnapping Act following the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh Jr. He is also given credit for embracing enhanced methodologies for crime scene investigation.  The quality of acting is highly commendable and does to some extent offset what is an underrepresented narrative.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

1401922732|5.0|Love the Archangel Michael Oracle cards. The artwork is beautiful, I love how there is a prayer at the bottom of these cards. I also love that there is a guide book to help get the full meaning of the cards. I'm a beginner and I did a reading for myself asked a question and it was on point. Beautiful deck!! Blessing to whom reads this review:)
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I watched this movie in theaters and it was like pulling teeth to sit through the entire thing.  The director likes to do this thing where an actor will say a line and then wait far too long before the other actor responds.  That is if they respond at all.  There is one scene in a car that has only one sentence!  It's hard to relate this in a written review.  Some might call this technique \\"art\\" which would be fine if it wasn't the entire movie.  I have read other reviews on here and some people really like this movie a lot.  I suggest if you have your heart set on checking this movie out then just rent it first.
1455510319|5.0|Fifth Witness is the second book I've read in the Haller series and, while Bosch remains my favorite character, I am coming to like Mickey Haller very much. But in addition to creating a strong character in Haller, author Michael Connelly also gives readers several other good ones. Most notably in this novel is the woman accused of murder, Lisa Trammel, who is oddly unlikable while at the same time being admirable.<br /><br />Although Lisa is extremely self-centered and opportunistic, her fighting spirit and willfulness more or less forces the reader to give her a degree of admiration, albeit grudgingly. And Connelly has given her a caginess that, while apparent, nevertheless keeps readers guessing about her motives.<br /><br />Then there are Haller's former wives, one of whom is now his office manager and the other who is an assistant district attorney. It is this latter woman, Margaret McPherson, who is the more interesting, and whom Haller has nicknamed Maggie McFierce. Her colleague, Andrea Freeman, ends up prosecuting Trammel and going up against Haller in court. Freeman is another well drawn character, competent and smart, and relentless.<br /><br />Connelly is one of the few male authors who is generally good at developing female characters. His women usually have depth and are not merely placeholders inserted as foils for the male hero. And characters like Lisa are unpredictable, which translates to more realistic.<br /><br />But the bottom line for me on any detective novel or thriller is the plot. Connelly seldom disappoints on this criterion and The Fifth Witness holds its own with his best books. The ending, while not a shocker, has a surprise that I did not see coming and also opens up some new horizons for Haller, which left me with the feeling that I should make it a point to read the next installment in this series.
B0068TL23G|2.0|The UI is pretty clumsy and too difficult to use, even for an adult much less a child, which is too bad because my kids want to play it but struggle too much navigating the UI.  The app is poorly behaved. The background music continues to play after I push home to navigate away from the app.  And when I try to navigate back to the app, 5 out of 10 times the app locks up upon re-launch and is stuck with a black screen with the teeny tiny UI icons in the bottom corners that are unresponsive. The only fix is to force close the app using the app manager to start it fresh.  Avoid thus app unless you get it for free.  Device is Nexus S running Android 4.0.3.
B005ILWOZA|4.0|James Morrison is a breath of fresh air from the stink that dominates the radio nowadays. I have all his albums, and they all hold a special place in my music library. He has quickly become among my top ten favorite artists since found out about his music. With that said, I don't think he has yet released a truly great album. All his songs are good, and some are great, but at the end of the day he has hasn't released a collection of songs that truly showcase the power of his voice. I love his music though, and until he releases that masterpiece I'll be here waiting In My Dreams.

1856697525|5.0|Find the common element among these things: _Psycho_; United Airlines; Quaker Oats; Dixie Cups; _Goodfellas_; the Girls Scouts of America.  I picked a grab bag, and I could have included a lot more, to show how diverse the work of Saul Bass was; he did graphics, and more, for all of them.  There is no bigger name in graphic design than Saul Bass, and now there is a gorgeous book, huge and colorful as befits his career, _Saul Bass: A Life in Film and Design_ (Lawrence King Publishing) by his daughter Jennifer Bass, herself a graphic designer, and Pat Kirkham, who teaches decorative arts and design history.  Flip through the 400 big pages here, and you are bound to find logos, posters, and movie title sequences you have seen many times; Bass's range and influence were astonishing.  There is a bit of biography here, along with a relatively chronological summary of his work from his poster for his high school's open house through the poster for _Schindler's List_.  The text is worth reading, and the authors have quoted generously from Bass's own thoughts on his life, work, methods, and output.  As befits Bass's legacy, however, this is a picture book, and it is a treat for the eyes.<br /><br />Bass grew tired of following formulas and \\"cramming as much illustration, type and hype as you possibly could into ads\\" in the early days, and eventually specified that he would not work on movie ads.  In 1946, however, he realized he had to get out to Hollywood.  Title sequences of the movies were conventional letters over conventional backgrounds, and sometimes theaters ran the initial credits over the curtain as it went up.  Bass thought a film began at the first frame and deserved a mood-setting overture.  His title sequences are famous for setting the tone of the film, and are among the best ever made, from the swirling Lissajous patterns of _Vertigo_ to the funny cartoons preceding _It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World_.  Bass (and his wife Elaine, who gets much credit in this book for their joint efforts) had a \\"fade out\\" from making movie titles.  He had a lot of corporate work to do, and was making his own documentaries and film essays (he also directed one feature film, _Phase IV_).  He also found that directors were newly interested in using the title sequence themselves creatively, and perhaps this was a response to his own work.  Nonetheless, he came back in the 1990s, working for among others Martin Scorsese (who writes the book's forward), for whom he did the admirable credits for _Goodfellas_, _Cape Fear_, _The Age of Innocence_, and _Casino_.  Among the most interesting pages here are the reproductions of preparatory sketches leading to a final product.  Bass would do perhaps 300 sketches for a single simple logo.  Some of the pictures here show Bass getting ready to make a presentation of his logo work to a particular corporation - there are hundreds of alternative designs on the walls.  Bass was a master of the presentation of the final design to corporate clients; he liked being \\"on stage,\\" had excellent comedic timing and wit, and connected with each client individually.  The presentation was the culmination of intensive work, starting with an analysis of what the company had done, its competitors, and its communication materials, and even enlisting market research.  It is significant that Bass thought that one of the most interesting parts of his work was the interviews with one executive at a time.  \\"I get to ask powerful and often interesting people about their work and their lives.  It is in their heads that the real blueprint for the future exists or is being formed.\\"<br /><br />Bass was devoted to progressive causes, and did plenty of pro bono work; there are designs here for the ACLU, the Special Olympics, Boys Clubs, YWCA, and more.  Bass had a devoted family, and people who worked for his firm remembered a dynamic, funny, intense man who loved his job.  When they split off to make their own firms, he gave them his blessing - it was part of the creative process, and he had done the same thing himself.  To see the many designs in this book is to appreciate that while his work was too diverse to have any one unifying esthetic, it was characterized by simplicity, distillation, and minimalism, and was always forceful because it was so concentrated.  Revealingly, he was anxious with every new assignment; he told young designers that \\"the only difference experience made, he believed, was the knowledge that since one had managed to come up with good ideas in the past, there was good reason to believe it would happen again.\\"  He also said that considering present work is humbling \\"because no matter how much experience you have, the blank page is still terrifying.\\"  Maybe so, but he conquered any such fears countless times, with successes reproduced here on page after page of memorable, effective images.of the creative process, and he had done the same thing himself.

B001UV4XFG|4.0|This was purchased as a gift for someone at Christmas.  They were very happy with the item and there were no problems.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This gadget just made me so happy that I wish I could put +5 stars. Soundfly seriously went above and beyond with this fmtm.<br /><br />I've owned them all pretty much, and just returned the iTrip Universal that I bought because of the abysmal audio quality. I hate static and just couldn't enjoy my songs with Griffin's piece of junk (shame, because the old model was ok). Anyway, Soundfly's fmtm gives me no static on blank channels, but if they're hard to find (I'm in NY where blank channels are rare) the mostly blank channels only give me static at extremely loud volumes. It also has more than enough presets for favorite blank stations.<br /><br />As for features, this is by far the most feature-filled fmtm I've ever seen. Lots of fmtm's have usb for charging, but how many have usb for playback?? Let alone SD memory slot, aux in AND out, and a remote?!? So nice. The fmtm has an equalizer and volume control built in so you can fine-tune how you like to hear your stuff. I found my \\"sweet spot\\" setting using a custom treble and bass level, volume halfway on the fmtm and on my phone, and ALL THE WAY up on my car stereo. Sounds unlike any other fmtm I've ever heard.<br /><br />So if you're an audiophile on a tight budget, you can enjoy your music again with this, and therefore enjoy your car ride. Or if you want the most feature-filled accessory you'll ever buy, grab this. I don't regret driving anywhere anymore.<br /><br />If I had to list a complaint, it would be the weird noise I get (sometimes) my phone is connected via aux AND usb charging through the unit while I use my phone; I think it's my phone's fault though, not the gadget's. Hope this helps!

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I watched the First Season on TV and was mesmerized. I don't have words to describe the impression I received. Acting is superb, cinematography and sets give you a perfect glimpse of the country and society portrayed. The tasteful nudity in some scenes only adds substance to the court settings and general trends of that particular society. Well done!  Right away I bought the four novels and am equally impressed by George R.R. Martin, author of the saga. He truly is a great writer. Let's hope that HBO goes forward with the series through many seasons.

B0051OJG4Q|4.0|I was concerned by other reviews of this set who complained about the 'scratches and pop' from the original records ruining these discs, but I took a chance and don't regret it. I'm very critical of sound quality and I found only one of the 8 albums in this set to have any problem -- the second half of the first disc (the songs that made up the original album called 'Lonely Girl'). Yeah, the recording on those 13 songs is a little rough, but it's not all that bad and if it really bothers you then you can just not play the last half of the first disc. The recording and digitizing on the rest of the set is fine. When you consider that the set contains a total of 99 songs and that all of these original albums are out of print and hard to find, scoring all this great early Julie London music for this low price is an incredible deal.<br /><br />Just for the record(s) -- the 8 albums compiled in this boxed set are as follows.

B006T5FDLG|5.0|Death Magnetic was insane. Front to back, left to right, up and down. These 4 tracks really do a great job in closing out the Death Magnetic studio sessions. Each track has it's own feel and easily could have fit on the Death Magnetic album. I'm glad Metallica decided to release them to the fans, as we've been asking for a while about them! This is a must own for any Metallica fan... they're instant classics! Now, I want a deluxe album containing these 4 tracks AND the 10 from Death Magnetic.
B005ARYEY6|5.0|Not much to add to earlier reviews. Simply superlative music by a great group that had the benefit of performing together for so long. What an opportunity though to hear this music of 45 yrs ago and appreciate that this could have come out this yr (well, in a sense it did) and still been considered cutting-edge. You can especially appreciate where Shorter left off before going commercial, then returning with his outstanding creative output the past few yrs. Perhaps monotonous to some but for me especially enlightening was to hear supposedly same titles played at different concerts but sounding distictly different each night. And to top things off to have such a clear and revealing DVD!! The music on the DVD is of course noteworthy, but what was subtlely revealing to me (and it took me a while to realize this) was the impeccable dress of all the musicians, reflecting a clear appreciation of what they were doing and of the audience. You dont see that in many performers these days. This is simply must-have material for any serious jazz enthusiast.

I would definitely recommend this.
B000A3EJB8|5.0|For anyone who has a DVD player that can play Region 2 imports it is worth the price of buying the Region 2 version of this film, to see it with the original formating. If for no other reason than to have seen this film in its intended format I'm glad I did buy the all region player. This is truly a wonderful film, which I hope someday someone may think to issue as a Blu-Ray, and not in a non-USA format. If you've never seen this film please do yourself a favor. Even in the 1.33-1 format it's wonderful.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|Nicolas Winding Refn's \\"Drive\\" is a minimalist love letter to films like Michael Mann's \\"Thief\\" and William Friedkin's \\"To Live and Die in L.A.\\" from the use of pulsating sythesizer music to score the film to riveting action sequences alternating with long, drawn out scenes of the Driver (Ryan Gosling) doing exactly what he's best at--driving getaway cars, Hollywood stunt vehicles. Keep in mind that \\"Drive\\" although it echoes things like the titles from a film like \\"Thief\\", \\"To Live and Die in L.A.\\" (a William Friedkin film) and \\"Manhunter\\" in terms of its soundtrack, titles, asthetics, etc., is an indie film with a distinctive European art house flavor.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br />The Driver has a specific code for right and wrong that he lives by. Moving out of his isolated world the Driver falls for Irene (Carey Mulligan)a married woman who's ex-con husband Standard (Oscar Issac)ends up spelling trouble when the Driver in an attempt to help Irene acts as a driver for one last job to liberate Irene and her family.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS<br /><br />\\"Drive\\" is minimalist in every sense of the word from the sparse dialog to the straight forward emotional connection that the Driver develops with those around him from Irene to his employer and friend Shannon (Bryan Cranston). Featuring a terrific supporting cast (Albert Brooks in an unexpected turn as a bad guy, Ron Perlman, Christina Hendricks in what amounts to a cameo), \\"Drive\\" won't be for everyone but those who like the unusual mixture of genre action films mixed with art films that Mann helped pioneer back in the 1980's will enjoy this retro thriller.<br /><br />The DVD looks positively stunning with a nice, sharp transfer. Colors vary a bit from the cool surfaces of the night photography to the warmer skin tones during the day sequences of the film.

However when I needed to fix a relative's computer in a different state I thought I would try it and their desktop version.  Since my relative was very computer shy, having him use his email address that he knew was very helpful and soon I was able to remove spyware, install updates, and customize his computer for him even though he was running Vista and I was on Android and Windows 7. Now I can access my home desktop computing power for use on big tasks and save my tablet and netbook for smaller tasks. AWESOME.
B0067QPVD2|4.0|Taking the James Cameron approach to a sequel (in Cameron's case, it was \\"Aliens\\" to Ridley Scott's \\"Alien\\")to \\"The Thing\\" prequel, director Director Matthijs van Heijningen's prequel to Carpenter's classic film redesigns the lead in the film for a Ripley type heroine and plays with our expectations based on the first film. Interestingly, the 2011 version of \\"The Thing\\" seems like more of a remake of Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby's \\"The Thing from Another World\\" (adapted from the same novella as Carpenter's film).<br /><br />What's forgotten is that the 2011 \\"The Thing\\" was a box office and critical flop when it first appeared in 1982 for a variety of reasons (chief among them is that it pushed the edge when it came to on screen gore and creepy looking creatures). The reputation of \\"The Thing\\" came about due to multiple showings on cable TV and home video so it seemed like an unlikely candidate for a prequel. Many fans suspected that the 2011 film was nothing more than an excuse to remake the 1982 classic.<br /><br />Director Matthijs van Heijningen and writer Eric Heisserer make every effort to avoid repeating scenes from the first film but, instead, plays a clever variation on the scenes we KNOW from the first film. That works to the advantage of the film as the plot unfolds in a very different fashion from Carpenter's film.<br /><br />The 2011 prequel is a well made film and has a number of very suspenseful moments but it also has its flaws; if you have seen Carpenter's film you know what to expect it's a matter of WHEN to expect it. Luckily the writer and director do a good job of bypassing this issue most of the time by creating scenes that compliment Carpenter's film rather than duplicate them. For example the writer and director create a Thing that is much less subtle and sneaky clearly suggesting that the creature learned from the encounter here but it also allows the creature to behave slightly differently than Carpenter's version keeping this film interesting.<br /><br />Also the CGI although serviceable doesn't look quite as convincing as the physical effects from the original movie (the director originally shot the film using physical effects BUT was forced to replace them with the CGI in the film).<br /><br />Casting Mary Elizabeth Winstead in the role of what amounts to Mac's role (played brilliantly by Kurt Russell in the 1982 film)turns the film on its head; the members of the Norweign team aren't accustomed to taking orders from a woman much less an American who isn't even a member of their team. She's an outsider although the writer and director miss the opportunity to milk this tension filled relationship, they do get good milage out of it by putting her into direct conflict with Dr. Halvorson.<br /><br />The Blu-ray for \\"The Thing\\" good but keep in mind this is as dark and grainy as the 1982 film that Carpenter made. Detail is pretty solid throughout. Colors are muted although skin tones look quite nice but are a bit on the cool side (which isn't a surprise). The color scheme is (not surprisingly)very much like Carpenter's film.<br /><br />Audio is robust and powerful with a beautiful sounding 5.1 lossless presentation. When havoc breaks out the audio does a nice job of supporting the film making sure we are dropped right in the middle of the action.<br /><br />The special features are quite good including \\"The Thing Evolves\\" a solid featurette on the production of the movie and \\"Fire and Ice\\".<br /><br />We also get a commentary track from the director and producer Eric Newman. The BD is also D-Box Motion enabled.<br /><br />We also get deleted/extended scenes which hint at the different film that the director might have had in mind. It's clear that there was some post-production studio interference in the structure of the film. We also get a DVD copy of the film as well as the dreaded Ultraviolet copy as well as \\"Pocket Blu Applications\\" and BD Live (although I didn't access this)capability.<br /><br />Although it isn't quite up to the level of Carpenter's classic film, the 2011 version of \\"The Thing\\" is still pretty scary and entertaining.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS: (SPOILERS)Dr. Kate Lloyd (mary Elizabeth Winstead) flies out to the remote Anarctic Norweign station by Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) to do an analysis of the remains of a creature pulled from the ice. Recommended by Halvorson's assistant Adam (Eric Christian Olsen), Kate finds out that the Norweign team has discovered an alien spacecraft and its former occupant. While taking tissue samples for typing Halvorson awakens the creature from its cold slumber and the group quickly discover that the Thing is unlike anything else they've ever encountered; it can \\"become\\" any member of the team. It's clear that the creature wants to escape so it's up to Kate and Sam (Joel Edgerton)an American pilot to protect the team and destroy the creature.<br /><br />Recommended.Although it isn't quite up to the level of Carpenter's classic film, the 2011 version of \\"The Thing\\" is still pretty scary and entertaining.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS: (SPOILERS)Dr. Kate Lloyd (mary Elizabeth Winstead) flies out to the remote Anarctic Norweign station by Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) to do an analysis of the remains of a creature pulled from the ice.

0385344228|3.0|First District Attorney, Andy Barber's, fourteen-year-old son, Jacob is accused of murdering a classmate. Whether he's guilty or not, the arrest throws a once happy family into chaos. The big question for the parents is: Did he do it? Andy is convinced, almost unbelievably at times, that his son is innocent. Laurie, the mother, isn't so sure. She remembers problems from Jacob's early childhood that Andy refuses to believe signify anything. When Andy is finally forced to confess that his father, Bloody Billy, is in prison for murder, Laurie's world collapses.<br /><br />The opening of this book was completely enthralling. We are in Andy's head and against all logic he simply won't confront the idea that Jacob could be guilty. However, the book is very long and after awhile this complete lack of questioning begins to wear. It feels unreal.<br /><br />The legal background is interesting and generally well done. However, I found the transcript portions of the grand jury testimony unrealistic. Andy, the witness, seems to be playing the role of the judge when he calls the Assistant District Attorney by his first name and asks him to restate questions. I found it hard to believe that the judge in a real grand jury investigation would have allowed the obvious animosity to go on.<br /><br />I liked the book and enjoyed reading it. The opening portray of Andy draws you in. However, as the book drags on the author seems to have trouble sustaining the head in the sand portrayal of Andy. I think perhaps because the book is so long, the twist at the end didn't feel real. It seemed like a literary artifice. However, the book is well worth reading if you like unusual character portrayals and court room drama.

B004O3YGMC|2.0|Thought this was the coolest idea when I stumbled upon it, but it stopped working a week after download?! Couldn't get it back up so I had to uninstall. When it was working I found it was difficult to scroll up or down on an open window. Disappointing for a paid app, disappointing because its such a cool idea. Came on to write a review &amp; started to read other reviews, found out there were tons of other desktop remote apps &amp; free too! Downloaded teamviewer free app &amp; have been able to enjoy this type of app with no problems! Thank goodness for the other reviewers, thanks for the info!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Fun, challenging gameplay with attractive graphics.  Over far too soon, but well worth the price.  Bring on the sequel soon!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|thought it was pretty good but it takes a while to unlock new games I would however rocomend it to a couple friends.
0812992792|5.0|Makes \\"1984\\" read like a bedtime story. Beautifully written, the first half presents the readers with seemingly unrelated threads of plot that, in the end, get pulled together like a bird snare.
1400052181|4.0|The writing style made this book a relatively easy read. Content-wise, it was very interesting; I was amazed to learn how one woman's cells changed the face of medicine and research. While I appreciate it was necessary to feature the rest of Ms Lacks' family, I found that sometimes there was a little too much about them. For me, Deborah was a very special character and so was Bobette but unfortunately I cannot say the same about her siblings and other relatives. I finished the book with a feeling I had learnt a lot about a subject I had known nothing about until then.
B003L77G06|5.0|I love this show! I bought the first and second season and I love watching the episodes again. They are well written and never fail to make me burst out laughing. Every time I re-watch an episode, I find something else to laugh at. And every actor in the ensemble is incredible - their comic timing is impeccable and the story-lines are top-notch. This is hands-down, the best show on tv right now. I hope it's around for a long time.
B006ZS81GG|5.0|I am simply addicted to this Album! Her songs are so CATCHY! Who cares that she gave a bad performance on SNL? Everyone has their up's and down's. I LOVE this album an d i recommend it to EVERYONE! Her songs are moving and easy listening! And let's not forget that she has a beautiful voice! Way to go Lana!
0439023521|5.0|What's not to love?  There's a spunky heroine adept with the bow and arrow, and who's got heart; a love triangle, choices humans are given and how they decide to live their life.  Excited about the movie coming out, I have to reread it by then.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|surprisingly easy to pass time. great to have for long trips. most games are mindless, but there are a few who are frustrating.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I found that while my Grado SR-80i headphones sound great when plugged into an amp at home, there was a lack of clarity on the go.  Even with the EQ options on the android app I use, my cell phone simply could not deliver the kind of signal to really drive these headphones, leaving some songs sounding muffled.  In comes the Fiio E6, and this tiny wonder restored punchy and responsive bass to my tunes.  It no longer feels like my headphones are being starved!  As for battery life, I have no idea because I just got the E6, but the improvement in sound is quite noticeable when using headphones that require some extra power.<br /><br />One downside is that the pre-programmed EQs in the E6 cannot compare to a proper, multi-frequency, equalizer... If you're picky about your levels, do not expect much in that respect.  I wish it were possible to program the E6's EQ settings via a usb connection to my computer.  With the stock settings, you're much better off seeking a software solution on your portable music player instead.  If you're using an android device, I highly recommend PowerAMP which features a full-range graphic equalizer that beats every other music app out there.<br /><br />[EDIT] 2 months later: The battery life is reliable.  I've let it run nonstop with volume on full blast, and a full charge will last for over 24 hours.  Listening a few hours a day, I charge it maybe once every 5 days. Changed from 4 to 5, even if the EQ presets are lame.
B005V20JKI|3.0|I like the gameplay but it skips alot and doesn't register my movements most of the time. my droidx has a very hard time running it. unplayable. uninstalling. but it looks fun
B001LOU6ZS|5.0|This is a really great rock album.  One of my favs from back in the early 80's.  It really deserves 4.5 stars.  Great melodies and harmonies, great Mogg singing, great lyrics, great Andy Parker drumming and great Chapman hooks.  What more could you ask for?  This is really a hidden-gem of an album.  I like this better than a couple of the UFO offerings that have Michael Schenker.  I say this being one of the most die-hard UFO fans out there who has played the entire UFO catalog (up through The Visitor) so many times it would make your head spin.
B004I744AS|5.0|...fun, informative, useful, user friendly...vry enjoyable...helpful, well organized, nice set up, excellent resource...all the right elements in one place, on one app., nice!
B005F9TQ9C|5.0|a dylan fan for over 40 years, i have never heard this album until today, 2-1-2012, and i have to wonder what i was waiting for...  it is great, if you're a fan of Bob, you'll love this album. It's an album of covers, but they sound great and they are obviously songs Bob enjoyed singing...  there are some real gems awaiting your discovery, like \\"Days of '49\\", a classic that Bob could have written himself...  he's in good voice and the individual cuts come from studio sessions where he's just warming up with the band, not that Band, there are lots of different players, but there are still some cuts with The Band...  very enjoyable...  don't know why it aint' remastered...
B000ATQYT2|5.0|It was a great purchase for someone who is a Muppet's fan and can't find a copy of this DVD in stores anymore.  I will look buy from this seller again.
B005AUWY90|4.0|Without a doubt, this is not for little kids. They simply will not understand much of the material that is showed in the beginning, but for Bond, James Bond fans, this show excels The Incredibles, which had a very Bond-ish feel to it (music, creeping around, etc.). This film was blatant Bond in classic form, complete with a shallow reason for hating the world and a hidden villain that is revealed only at the last moment by . . . of all cars, Mater!  The is one moment that had my wife and in stitches (and the player in pause) but for the most part, the humor is not over the top. Sure, the show is fun, but unless you're really alert, you can easily become lost through the first half of the show. And that's too bad, considering the amount of work that must have gone into making this incredible film.  So what didn't I like enough to give this five stars? The somewhat confusing plotline for one thing. That and this certainly was not geared for young children, which is where most of the Pixar films shine (with a couple of exceptions -- Up being one of them).
B005HSG3VK|5.0|product was just as pictured.  works great would recommend this item to others. the only thing the pen  that came with it, the soft tip fell out wasn't secure.

030788743X|5.0|I'm a child of the 80's (born in 1980, in fact).  I grew up with games always around me.  From the pre-NES days, to the current systems.  I've always had a soft spot for gaming even now.  After seeing a few positive reviews from fellow tech heads, and a newly revived itch to read constantly, I picked this book up.  I won't bore you with the same \\"X character, X story, my favorite X moment\\" review.  I'm sure you've read those.  The synopsis, and other reviews you've no doubt glanced at have given you the core.  I just want to say a few things.  The story does an excellent job of connecting with the reader.  From the constant 80's references, the way it describes the virtual world most is set in, etc.  It all is done in a way that will click with almost any tech/gamer/geek/etc.  You won't find any problem turning the pages, reading into the night to find out how it all ends.  In fact, by the time this book ended not only was I very happy with the nature of things (hooray for an ending that actually gives some closure!), but it actually created a new want for me to explore the sort of techy/cyberpunk genre further.  Just finished SNOW CRASH, recommended in the author interview you no doubt read above the reviews, because I loved this book so much.  The quick and dirty of it:  You want to read this book.  If you're a gamer, a tech head, a geek/nerd, a child of the 80's or you just like a good read no matter the genre... you will love it.  If you're a child of the 80's (or late 70's) you'll love the references.  I kept remembering little glimpses to my childhood with music, games, etc, being referenced.  So why are you still reading this?  Click BUY NOW.  Download it to your iPad, Android device or Kindle and read away!  You can thank me later.
B005QJZ5FA|3.0|Lana Del Ray (not her real name, BTW) certainly has listened to her share of Hooverphonic, Morcheeba and all the other artists from the early 2000s wave of Portishead influenced trip hop groups, complete with the lush ballads and eerily beautiful nuances. Not bad, just not overtly original.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|This app is a lot of fun and gives you the right amount of challenges. It helps pass the time away too! You will really enjoy this game once you get the hang of it and tweak the options that suits you.
1451627289|4.0|Take a deep breath and leap down the 'Rabbit Hole' into the Past!  Thrilling and convincing! Although I didn't exist during that era, my mind's eye realized many of the staples of mid-century America as they came to life once more. The tinny, lilting pop music of the AM radios! The bright red Vendo machines chilling glass Co'Cola bottles! The ridiculously bulky and aerodynamically-challenged autos!  My palate yearned for that rich and frothy rootbeer that Jake-George Amberson-Epping had the fortune of dumping down his yap! Seriously though, I was quite surprised when, after delving into this novel because of the JFK content, I became even more engrossed in the lives of the rest of the characters! This book transports the reader and evokes some intense emotions along the way. The factual elements relating to the Assassination are accurate enough to ensure epic status IMO! AND YES, OSWALD DID IT ALONE!! Poo-Poo on the conspiracy-theorists!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is perfect for those who want access to the Bible at the tip of their fingers. I especially like the reading plan feature that allows you to get started &amp; stayed committeed to your goal. This app is a must-have.

630179513X|2.0|While Back to the Future 1 & 2 & the followup interactive movie (game) by Telltale were all wonderful, Back to the Future III falls short. Even though the trilogy is really just one long movie broken into 3 parts, III takes itself far less seriously than the first two parts & has more suspension of disbelief problems, the worst of them being the unbelievably contrived Disney romance between Emmett Brown (whom is 70 or 80 years old) & the utterly useless token love interest Clara Brown (30 or 40 years old).  Seriously, unless you're a big fan of Back to the Future: The Animated Series, Clara is a completely useless piece of filler. No wonder Clara was reduced to a mentionable in the Telltale game; Brown's alternate timeline love interest Edna Strictland at least had a personality, background story, & served an actual purpose. Realistically, when two best friends both get married, they dedicate themselves to their families & drift apart, so I couldn't really take it as a happy ending either.
0385535139|5.0|This is a very good book - read it on a recent trip between the East cost and West cost. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Grisham's dry sense of humor.

0525478817|5.0|This book quickly shot into my top 3 favorite books of all time...and I *devour* books.<br /><br />This book literally (and I, too, have a huge pet peeve for the misuse of the word literally) made me laugh out loud and cry.  Sure, some books can get you in the gut, some get that lump in your throat, some even get your eyes watery.  But this book made me cry.  The only other book that got that much emotion out of me was \\"Marley and Me\\" (gaahhhh!!! Why, God, why!!?).  The Fault In Our Stars was mostly funny, witty, adorable, charming and just...lovely? Lovingly? Love.<br /><br />I cannot stop telling people about this book.  I want everyone who has more than 5 minutes at the end of the day to give it to this book.  It's pretty short and a therefore a quick, easy read.  Of course, the first question out of everyone's mouth is, \\"What's it about?\\" and at first I would say, \\"It's about teenagers with cancer.\\" Oh. fun. Let me just end my day with that lump of fun in my tea. Thanks Dena. I would immediately add something like, \\"It's funny though, and so sweet and endearing.  It's seriously one of the sweetest books I've ever read.\\"  So now, when people ask me what it's about I tell them, \\"It's a love story but it's different...you just have to read it.\\"  I wish I had copies and I could go around and just give it to people.  lol<br /><br />When I put the book down I shut the light off to go to sleep and I just thought about what I personally have taken away from the book.  A character in the book talks about wanting to be remembered in this world, about making a difference.  Not just living and then dying a \\"nobody\\". If you affect one person in this world.  One person's heart.  If you have lived and they have loved you, you have made an impact on the world.  You have made a difference.  Love is the most powerful thing in this universe.  You are capable of giving it to others as well as creating it in others towards you.  When someone loves you, it makes a huge difference in their life. Otherwise there wouldn't be that huge, gaping, gut-wrenching hole where most of their insides are supposed to be after you are gone.uldn't be that huge, gaping, gut-wrenching hole where most of their insides are supposed to be after you are gone.
B00028HBKM|5.0|this is the original version i was looking for! i been hearing that the new cut version is not as good as this one! i mean why try to deny something that happen in the past? and that was actually the way that it did happen! i can understand the other people who try to hide violence to their kids! but the way i think is if you are going to talk to your kids about our father then you might as well tell them the real truth how he suffered for us and this is how he gave his life for us!

B0059XTUB8|4.0|This was a surprisingly good adaptation of a questionable romance between Marilyn and Colin Clark (while on her honeymoon with Arthur Miller!) Kenneth Branagh and Dame Judi Dench are fantastic as Olivier and Dame Sybil Thorndike as well as Julia Ormand as Vivien Leigh. The costumes,  Make-up and set detail make it fun for MM fans to see what it was like to be on the infamous set of The Sleeping Prince.<br /><br />The movie does show how screwed up Marilyn was emotionally as well as addicted to drugs and alcohol. Michelle Williams blew me away! She managed to capture the Marilyn Mystique through her voice and manerisms. Considering she really doesnt look like Monroe it is amazing. I think this is an extremely realistic look at the real Marilyn Monroe.<br /><br />An Excellent movie and throughly entertaining from beginning to end.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Rebecca Hamilton does an excellent job of creating a new way to see classic ideas. Her prose is smooth and her description so vivid you can picture each scene clearly, but she still leaves enough to the imagination that it is not leading a reader by the elbow. I enjoyed the pacing and the plot, and was truly moved by some of the lesser characters' struggles in their own lives.
0440180295|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five is now one of my favorite books upon finishing it. The book's narrative is very unique as it frequently jumps from one event to another as it chronicles the events of Billy Pilgrim's life before and after his experience in Dresden in WW2. The book is very entertaining and funny yet also sad and thought provoking all at the same time.  Some readers may get confused with the non-linear storytelling but the book isn't very long and the events are very detailed and unforgettable.  I also admire how Vonnegut described wartime conditions, soldiers did not always have adequate equipment and weapons and being a prisoner of war and forced into labor for you're enemies is not fun and serves as a good anti-war story.  i recommend this to anyone especially now when America is at war in the middle east and some people may change their minds about the perceptions of war as it changed mine.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|I dont normally read non-fiction but I put this book on my wish list and a friend got it for me.  I enjoyed the authors personal account and his use of historical data and stories.  I still have the 15 random words locked into my memory palace weeks after I finished the book.

0553106635|5.0|This is a great series.  The author understands how to tell a story, and that the story is more important that any one character.  It can be a rollercoaster of emotion, but it is a great story.  Not appropriate for kids though.  Or any adult that is sensitive to adult types of content.

0525423656|5.0|SUMMARY -<br />Cassia has been sent to work camps so she can learn submission to the Society after her love for Ky was discovered.  But she is really here to find Ky, who was sorted and taken away.  And she was the one who sorted him.  Now it's up to her to find him; if she could only get into the Outer Provinces...  She has the Compass from Ky and the blue tablets from Xander, and she will use both of them to find her way.  Two boys, two worlds, and one journey that will break hearts, heal hearts, and change them.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS -<br />I am a very expressive reader.  Meaning, I jump, scream, squeal, blush, giggle, laugh, groan, and more - very openly.  My poor family...  ;)  In any case, as far as the louder, more intense expressions of emotion go - I save those for the best of the best.  So know I'm telling you the truth when I say that Crossed is one of the best of the best.  I screamed at least seven times, blushed, giggled, jumped, and groaned - all in this book.  And the screaming - it was loud.  Just sayin'.<br /><br />Even more shocking and amazing is that my sister, who is not one to show such strong emotions while reading, not only did the same as I did, but also screamed/giggled with me when I read it!<br /><br />Not only did it excite me (and my sister) to extremes, but it also made me want to sit still (I know, ironic, huh?) and contemplate the beautiful, poetry-like prose, the deeper meanings, the lyrical tones.<br /><br />While reading I came across the sentences -<br /><br />So many beginnings.  I tell myself that in a way it's good that I haven't found Ky yet, because I still don't know what to whisper to him when I see him, which words would be the very best ones to give.  (Page 111)<br /><br />These words are beautiful, and they portray something deeper than just Cassia thinking of what she'll say to Ky. It's about how precious speech is, how important it is to her that Ky taught her to write, to speak and give life to words.  It's about not taking your words for granted.  They are important, down to the very smallest word.  Cassia has grown up in a world where words - your own words, spoken or written - are like diamonds.<br /><br />This careful choice of words is not only portrayed in the characters, but also in Ally Condie's writing itself.  Her word choices are so precise, carefully portraying the scenes and the deep emotions carried throughout.  It's like poetry, but not.  I don't even know how to describe the full beauty of it.<br /><br />CHARACTER NOTES -<br />Here is how well I know these characters, how distinctly they are portrayed:<br />When the book arrived in the mail two months ago, before I knew really anything about it, I picked it up and started reading.  My thoughts were, \\"This is great, but it doesn't feel like...Cassia.  It doesn't sound like her voice at all.  I like it, but I'm confused...\\"  I put it on my shelf to read soon.  My sister got to it first, and came to me, saying excitedly, \\"It's from Cassia AND Ky's perspectives!\\"<br /><br />After a bit of sleuth-work, I discovered that the chapter I read was about Ky, from his perspective - and suddenly, it all fell together.  When I was actually reading the book, I never had an issue, determining which voice was which.  I mean, the chapters are labeled one or the other, but I didn't need that.  They both had a voice distinct form the other.  That amazed me, especially when both are written in first person, present tense.<br /><br />Vick, Indie, Eli, Hunter, and Xander were all really well-developed side characters, and I appreciate that.  I didn't love some of the characters themselves, but loved who they were for the story.<br /><br />And... I love Ky.  Oh, how I love Ky.<br /><br />Cassia really grew in this book.  She matured and did selfless things that made her radiant.  Her love for Ky makes her strong, glowing.  Makes her want to live to the fullest.  She loves deeply, cares so much, and wants to do the right thing.  She doesn't always, but that's how we learn sometimes.  Cassia is just like you and me, and that's the beauty of it.<br /><br />STORY NOTES -<br />Everything about this book had me grasping for more.  It's so refreshing to read this story and get lost in it.  I loved the journeys the characters had to face, together and apart.  There were scenes that made me scream and squeal with joy, and others that had my heart aching with sadness.  The emotions were so real and big and alive.<br /><br />I love Cassia and Ky's love story.  I love the reality of it, how heartfelt it is.  I feel like a lot of young adult love stories are full of couples whose only issue is that they're unable to be together, and other dramatic situations of the same kind.  Other than that, the relationships have virtually no issues, or very small ones.  I have nothing against that - a few of my forever favorites are that kind of love story.  But Ky and Cassia are different.  Out in the wild, they are allowed to be together - but they struggle because they have disagreements.  Because they have to ask, how much will I do for you?  How much do I really love you?  That is one of the many things I respect about their relationship.  It's perfect, with every argument, every kiss.<br /><br />Everyone has to sacrifice in this story, and that builds and strengthens the story/characters in a huge way.<br /><br />SUMMING IT UP -<br />Indescribably beautiful.  It's like, I can't even express my love.  Please, read Matched and Crossed.  Please.<br />Please.<br /><br />For the Parents -<br />Nondescript kissing.  Recommended 13+ng about this book had me grasping for more.  It's so refreshing to read this story and get lost in it.  I loved the journeys the characters had to face, together and apart.  There were scenes that made me scream and squeal with joy, and others that had my heart aching with sadness.  The emotions were so real and big and alive.  I love Cassia and Ky's love story.  I love the reality of it, how heartfelt it is.  I feel like a lot of young adult love stories are full of couples whose only issue is that they're unable to be together, and other dramatic situations of the same kind.  Other than that, the relationships have virtually no issues, or very small ones.  I have nothing against that - a few of my forever favorites are that kind of love story.  But Ky and Cassia are different.  Out in the wild, they are allowed to be together - but they struggle because they have disagreements.  Because they have to ask, how much will I do for you?  How much do I really love you?  That is one of the many things I respect about their relationship.  It's perfect, with every argument, every kiss.  Everyone has to sacrifice in this story, and that builds and strengthens the story/characters in a huge way.  SUMMING IT UP -  Indescribably beautiful.  It's like, I can't even express my love.  Please, read Matched and Crossed.  Please.  Please.  For the Parents -  Nondescript kissing.  Recommended 13+

B0034G4P4O|4.0|\\"Tintin\\" is in many ways a very good movie.  The animation is breathtakingly beautiful, and just stunning to watch.  The plot and the characters are a major improvement from the original Herge version.  But I just wonder if Tintin is really a good big screen concept.  Don't get me wrong.  I loved the comic series, and thought even the television cartoons quite good.  But there was always a careless innocence to Tintin, and Hollywood isn't really good with things with careless innocence.  This is standard Spielberg entertainment.  You go, you watch it, and you find it entertaining -- but it's certainly not a movie you'll get excited over, and recommend to your friends.
B002BWP49M|2.0|First off I saw this and had low expectations.  I felt the book was too long with little happening, so deciding to split it into two movies seemed like a bad idea.  That aside, the movie was better then I was expecting (as the star count show I was not expecting much.)  The movie is a really well done representation of the first half of the book; which unfortunately just drug on and on.  Die-hard-fans well be pleased with it and happy to see it cut into two.  The rest of the world would no doubt prefer a cut down to one movie, as four hours is way to much screen time for the little of interest that happens.  So to the movie itself, with little spoilers:  Visuals:  Filming was good and clean, nothing amazing, but good quality and bright colors.  I immediately notice the change in filming locations.  I'm not sure what brought on the choice to move from the NW (Oregon, Washington, and Canada) to Louisiana, but it was obvious.  The wear-wolves are still sub-par graphics.  The CG is alright, but stands out as computer work and throws you from the immersion of the film.  The few quick shots of Renesmee when she was older were very well done.  They did a great job of making it look like the exact same person years apart, it will be interesting to see her in part 2.  Audio:  The surround sound was weakly used, which in pathetically unacceptable these days.  It was not much better then stereo. The general audio was clear and clean, but it seemed poorly mixed.  The music was good, but not as good as Shore's score from the last one.  Getting tired of every movie having a different composer and thus feeling different.  The wear-wolf telepathic conversations sounded horribly corny.  That whole scene was laughable.  Overall:  They continue the tradition of destroying characters that you liked in the first book/movie.  New Moon and Eclipse brought you to the point of hating Edward, Bella, and Jake, Breaking Dawn starts attacking lesser characters such as Alice.  Jasper also lost his Southern accent he picked up for the second half of Eclipse.  The wedding was over done and the birth scene was underdone.  The climax scene was much better in the book.  Unless you are a Twilight Fanatic I advise renting it at the most, but most people could miss seeing this movie and not care.  If you insist on buying it, wait for the price to drop, and who knows they may package both halves together at some point.
B005WFWVL4|1.0|You see Paltrow, Law, Damon, Soderburgh, and u think, \\"Should be OK.\\" You soon wonder why Paltrow's character gets (SPOILER ALERT) taken out so quickly. I thought to myself: \\"Gwennyth read the script to the end, and said 'get me out of here!'<br />After the cure is found, this dull, plodding, confused-and-searching-for-meaning movie refuses to die, and continues useless scene after USELESS scene, as one imagines Soderburg and the screenwriter sitting around saying, \\"what should we add now?\\"<br />With MILLIONS dead, there's some confusing issue about states that are about to refuse to let people in or out (regardless of where they are living?)- so Lawrence Fishburne (who mails it in, never changing his expression the entire movie) 'breaks the rules' - and tells his fiancee to leave Chicago before this starts. This ridiculous bit of Jaywalking-as-crime is put up as some kind of 'terrible thing.' Were the writers drugged?<br /><br />What was seriously overlooked (or worse: tolerated) was the anti-semitism involved with this arab financing (Production financing money from Abu Dhabi): While Abu Dhabbi and Cairo are mentioned (laughably) for their 'scientific input,' the entire country of Israel is not shown on any maps, nor is it mentioned. What's up with that, Mr. Soderburgh? Did ya get a push for that Jew-hatred from your friends in the White House?<br /><br />Another piece of ignorance was a brief scene where a janitor asks Fishburne about treatment for Attention Deficit Disorder for his son. Instead of actually USING HIS POSITION as filmaker to raise public awareness about the DANGERS of Big Pharma pushing these dangerous drugs, this is given a pass by these cowardly stooges for the worst in our culture.<br /><br />An interesting plot turn that could have actually brought some drama to the movie was Paltrow's adultery - which is so ignored u wonder why it was brought up in the first place, and the kidnapped doctor who runs back to the village after finding out about the 'medicine'. Instead, there are scenes created to carry the picture forward - especially after the cure; and you wonder - towards what end???  It's as if the director was saying, now, if u want to add soapy - I'm-so-good-I-cant-bear-to-get-my-meds-out-of-turn' characters, and make a more sophomoric, 2-dimensional  movie by tossing cliche after cliche into an insipid mix of characters so lacking in interest that one simply cannot care who lives or dies... just, when is this thing over?,<br /><br />Please tell me this is not the same director that did Solaris and Traffic.

B0067QPVJ6|3.0|They had to make a prequel to one of the greatest movies : The thing with Kurt Russell... It had to be good to go against such a movie.<br />So without telling too much here is my review.<br />Monster effects: love the CGI...what you wanted more in the original, this movie<br />  will give you a lot of good effects.<br />Music: When they start playing that earie Bass line, you are brought back to the<br />  first movie, where the music took hold off you and finally spat you out<br />  by the movie 's end.<br />  But the problem, the bass line is at the beginning and at the end, so for<br />  most of the film, the music they use is ok...but nothing to grab you like<br />  the original...  The music score could have been even better here.<br />Acting: Bunch of guys  and 2 females.. the Original was all guys...and everyone<br />  was quite good and had character...In this movie, there is not enough time<br />  to know all of them like the first movie..could have been more scenes to<br />  see what these guys are all about without slowing down the movie..<br />  By having a female lead instead of Kurt Russell, everytime you have her<br />  in a scene, all cameras are on her,,and less on the others. ..So she has<br />  to kinda carry the whole movie...in which it does'nt work as good as when<br />  Kurt Russell did it.<br />Scenes:  Great Antartica scene will blow you away...really feel wintery and cold.<br /><br />end Note:  Like i said..its not a bad movie...could have been better in some areas<br />  and longer...they had the site, the people...but not the script..<br /><br />March 2012 update:  Tried to view it again... and eventually shut the movie<br />  off and i went for the original.<br />  The original is a classic...good every time you watch it...<br />  Cant say the same for this one...it just does'nt have<br />  qualities to make you want to watch it again and again.!!!

044022425X|5.0|This is the fourth installment in the Outlander series and once again, I felt like I was transported to a wonderful time with such a rich wealth of depth to her characters and plots.<br /><br />In this one, we have the two separate timelines again except one is Jamie and Claire and the other is their daughter, Brianna, and Roger her love interest and a man with close connections to Jamie through his lineage.  Soon all of them are in the past, but the lines are still not converged as Jamie and Claire, Bree, and Roger all have their separate storylines.  When they do converge, we are left breathless with the plot twists that do not make that the point of a satisfying ending.  There is so much going on and your heart is just wrenched so many times even as it beats hard in the dramatic moments. I do not wish to give any details about the plot because I do not like to give spoilers plus there is already a synopsis provided.<br /><br />I have been so completely engaged in this series, but there was something about this part of the story that just took it to a whole new level.  I laughed and cried, but all the way through I was rapt to discover what was in the next sentence and on the next page.  I am so glad that I had the next installment ready to go.<br /><br />Great read!
B006OT03BM|4.0|A nice set and all but a little over the top, came in like three boxes and was kind of fun to open. The bonus features on the disks, are all commentaries. I have no problem with em but it's sad that in three movies each about 2hrs in length, there were not more deleted scenes. Overall it's a very nice set, very big as well. I am not a big fan of the movies but I do find em enjoyable when I turn off my brain and put my dude bro glasses on XD, as I didn't own the first two and I would rather have em on blueray, I say this set is awesome to get. However, if you own them there is nothing really important on as far as bonus content goes unless your want to hear how the film was made and how Bay loves his mega phones. . . ALOT.
B000002J0N|5.0|To me, CSN is a milestone in music. This album comes out trumps in every department. The trio blends in together beautifully and yet each musician retains his indivdual stamp. What an achievement, what production values! Check the opening \\"Shadow Captain\\", that beautifully paces itself as sailing out in the open seas, with some lovely piano and drums; \\"See the changes\\", Stills writing of his own marital adjustment and problems, and some lovely, lovely acoustic guitars and harmonies; \\"Carried away\\", an absolute Nash beauty, some haunting piano and harmonica, a humdinger of a tune, the absolute hushful addition of the drums, and again some beautiful lyrics (lovve the harmonies for the \\"Trying to bring a balance to me and the man\\" line; \\"Fair Game\\" (the guitar is enough to hook you), some superb singing and writing by Stills; \\"Anything at all\\" (Crosby's superbly funny writing about a self-opinionated man and his imminent decline - love the haunting harmonies at \\"Ah, ah, oh, oh\\"); Cathedral (Nash's spooky drug-induced equivalent, to my mind, of \\"Hotel California\\"); oh, and I could go on about the other songs - Dark Star, again Still's marital piece set to a superb Latin rhythm; Nash's ode to goodbyes in the lovely, haunting \\"Just a song before I go\\"; Stills, gruff and manly confessing in \\"Run from tears\\"; Nash spinning the unforgettable, haunting \\"Cold rain\\", that's sure make to you feel lonely on a rainy afternoon; Crosby's masterful \\"In my dreams\\" (masterpiece of acoustic guitaring, love this song and the way the tune's divided beautifully in three segments - from the opening until \\"Turning, Turning, To see your face alone, I'm hoping there's someone home\\", then the dreamy, haunting \\"Dream, do you dream\\" and then the final \\"In my dreams  I can see, I can, I can see a love, That could be..\\"; and the final \\"I give you give blind\\" that's superb, but somehow to me, feels a wee bit out of sync with the rest of the album.  To sum up, this is a masterpiece. Go and buy it!!

0525478817|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this author, and this isn't the sort of book I would usually choose to read for myself. I just kind of stumbled across it browsing for something to read. I will say I am really glad I read this book.  It falls into the category of \\"books I must finish in one sitting.\\" When you read this book, you will understand why.  I literally \\"laughed out loud\\" while reading parts of this book. I also cried.  Having read this book, I feel like I'm going to LIVE life a little bit differently now, and I can say that not many books have had such an impact on me.  Thank you, John Green. Really.  Read this book. You will not be disappointed.

B000KITQK2|5.0|Got one of each of these preamps a few years ago- for electric guitar, bass and acoustic. I ended up putting the bass preamp in a sock drawer, it sounded good, but this little wonder sounded better.  The secret is the mid control- turn the mid level all the way up, and use the mid frequency knob to accent the range you want for more grind/definition/cutting power, then back the mid level off to where it blends well. adjust treble to taste then add the bass control for fullness. Unlike most bass controls this one actually works on a 5 string. my low B never sounded so good!  Tip: Keep crud out of the controls I thought my peadal was dead after a couple years of regular use, since no signal would pass through it. I thought \\"Darn cheap Behringer gear\\" and set it aside. a year later, I had a can of contact cleaner in my hand, saw this pedal and figued \\"What the heck, it couldn't hurt!\\" took the circuit board out and gave the pots and switches a good cleaning. Long story sort, it was good as new for another year, until a young bass player borrowed it and hooked in a 24 volt AC adapter - fried it...  I will certainly get this again!

0061733199|4.0|The general chapters on water, food and shelter are great. I doubt everyone needs to know how to survive an arctic adventure and which tropical fish will poison you, but those chapters are fun to read. If you plan on using any of the skills written about or pictured, they won't do you any good unless you try or practice some first. Ever try to start a fire by rubbing sticks? It takes a lot of effort and time to get it right. In a survival situation if you haven't practiced at least once, then you are behind the eight ball. Take some of these skills and practice with the kids, challenge your friends at a BBQ, do something fun with them. Knowledge may be power, but skills put food on the table and heat on your feet.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|I have to admit that I didn't come into this book with high hopes of it being the type of book that would captivate me and keep me up to all hours of the night.  For the most part I was spot on, however with that being said I would have to say that it wasn't a horrible read either. For the most part it was intriguing enough to keep my interest. I mean a world without love??  One of my biggest pet peeves of this book... the quotes from the books at the beginning of the chapters. I found it annoying.  The book is beautifully written, Lauren does an amazing job with convincing you that Love really is the reasoning behind everything horrible that has happened in the past. I found myself actually thinking and going yeah I can totally see how Love would make this situation worse.  I have to say that the main character Lena was quite annoying at first. I found myself yelling at her going \\"Get with the program already\\". Her constant over analyzing would drive me nuts. It wasn't until she actually started interacting with Alex that she became likeable to me.  From there the relationship between the two of them blossomed and had me swooning. It seems so pure and believeable. When it came down to the society putting a kabosh with their relationship I had myself saying \\"damn the man\\" and routing for them to be happy. I wasn't entirely happy with the way it ended, but I am very interested in continuing with the story to see how Lena fairs out.
030726999X|5.0|I love, love, love this book and this author!  I thoroughly enjoyed this series and was bummed to find out that the author had passed and there would be no more.  The books arrived ahead of schedule and I quickly plowed through them.  Thank goodness I have now found Jo Nesbo!
B000001ELP|5.0|Over the years I have been Saddened by \\"so-called-reviewers\\" attitudes to this Album. The ELDER is My Favorite Studio-Album by KISS..(the Other being Creatures of the Night) & I think it's their Most Musically-Mature. Don't forget they Made it when they were the BIGGEST Band on the Plannet, so they wanted to do something self indulgent & prove to Everyone that their Brilliant Musicianship could have Wonderful DYNAMICS of Light & Shade & could Write songs DEEPER than the \\"Yeah-Baby-in the back of my Cadilac\\" type lyric! I Challenge Any TRUE KISS-Fan to Dim the lights, sit back & BLAST \\"Odyssey\\" and Dare to Say that They were NOT taken away to Another Realm, while shedding a tear!

0439023521|5.0|I have to admit that when I first heard about the Hunger Games I was confused as to what the fuss was all about. I mean seriously what's so big about kids being forced into a game to the death?? So when I finally got around to buying a Kindle, the Hunger Games, was the first book I sat down to read. Three little letters says it all....OMG!!  Wow I totally ate all the words I said previously about the book. The brief synopsis I read about it did not do it justice at all.  I was immediately intrigued with the main character Katniss, and her relationship with everyone around her. Suzanne does a great job of introducing each and every character and how they relate to her. The descriptions of everything from the way they were dressed, to the description of the food was amazing. I could visualize everything while I was reading it.  The interaction between the characters and the humor was great, I caught myself laughing out loud at parts and crying during others. Yes there is violence, I mean it is a fight to the death, but it's not over done at all that younger teens couldn't read it. There is some romance but it's nicely written and it gives you just enough to imagine how young love starts and feels.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This wonderful journey towards love and happiness has so much passion, drama, playful bantering, friendships, ups and downs, heartbreak, devotion, and a totally dysfunctional and perplexing relationship that will tear at your heart. There are so many horrifically emotional feelings emitted from reading this unfathomable relationship of passion and love...utterly brilliant storytelling! The sensations throughout this story illustrates how two young adults can love one another with their whole being, which will totally take over their lives from every breath they take to simply trying to exist. Breathtaking!<br /><br />Abby and Travis are college students who literally battle their overwhelming potent and maddening affections for one another time and time again throughout the story. It is an intoxicating relationship that dangerously borders on destruction of themselves as their explosive passion and love grows breathtakingly out of control. Try breathing without air, that's how intense Abby and Travis are when they are in each other's bodies, minds and souls. Their love is truly an addiction that will tear at their hearts, divide and conquer them, dominate their total being, and unite them as one with their existence.<br /><br />This is one the of most remarkable, well-written stories I've read this year. Couple that with the most delightful characters and you have one amazing read! This is one story that cannot be ignored. Highly recommend to all young adult, romance enthusiasts...intoxicating read!
B003O86FMW|5.0|After finishing the first book in the series The Hunger Games, I couldn't wait to read the second Catching fire. I was just lucky enough to have started to read the books after all 3 of them were out so I could start right away.<br /><br />Catching Fire started off right were Hunger Games left, only a few months later down the road. We got to see how the lives of Katniss, Peeta, and their families have changed since they returned home the victors of the games. Since we got to know who Katniss was and who Peeta was, it was nice to see how they had grown and changed from the first book. How their relationship had changed, and even how Katniss's relationship had changed with her friends and family. To me she seemed more confident and self sure of herself.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, pretty much the book is about the unrest that results in the defiance Katniss did during the Hunger Games. She is forced to prove her love between Peeta and herself is real and when she fails, trouble erupts. Her and other random victors are selected to be put back into the arena to compete again. However this time Katniss vows to have Peeta survive at all costs. Bonds are made with the other victors and when they are thrown into the arena finally, alliances are built. Katniss and Peeta's relationship blossoms however it's harder to distiguish if it's still all an act or true this time. Then right at the end a play to escape the arena shows and some victors are rescued while others are not.<br /><br />Absolutely a page turner once again. I found myself yelling at my book, and having to put it down because I was laughing so hard because I could not believe that she actually went there. The ending kept me on the edge and dying to know the outcome of what had just happened.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|would be a great addictive app but it takes to long to earn money to purchase more mini games. that is unless you actually want to pay for them.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was super eager to begin this book because of the cliff hanger that was left at the end of Catching Fire.  However I have to honestly say that I was kind of disappointed with how it started.  Like in Catching Fire, we start Mockingjay a few months down the road from where the previous book left off. We learn that Katniss has been taken to District 13 along with a couple other tributes, while Peeta was captured by the Capitol. The war between the rebels and the Capitol is at an all time high and fighting is breaking out everywhere.  My overall first impression of District 13 was what a drag.. I mean the rules were way more stricter than they were when she was in District 12, and the leader just rubbed me the wrong way. Everything that I had initially thought about Katniss about being a confident, strong survior, went out the window and she seemed to turn into a beaten child that was on the verge of a mental breakdown.  The story was horrible slow and it every ounce of my body to keep reading to get threw them. I mean there was only so much I read about Gale and I go hunting, Gale and I view the weapons...etc. And really what happened to the strong confident Finnick??? He suddenly turned into this cowarding little boy, with no explanations???  However not everything was a downfall... we learn soooo much about how the Capitol controlled each victor even after they had won. You learn more about why Haymitch is the way that he is. When the remaining victors were rescued the descriptions of what they went threw made me want to cry. And Peeta... oh lord that was the worst of it all. I couldn't believe what I was reading and how after everything that we went through and that everything was built between Katniss and him, could be destroyed like that. But I LOVED how it played out in the end.  I personally thought that there was more violence in this book, especially towards the end of the book. But overall, I was happy with the way it ended. There was no happily ever after... instead we see how they overcome the loss they have suffered and how they move on from there.
0525478817|4.0|I had a really hard time trying to figure out what to say about this book, and how to rate it. First, I'd like to start with the fact that I did like this book, but that I was also a bit disappointed by it, especially after all the hype it received.<br /><br />I liked this book for a few reasons. The characters were wonderful and so lifelike (I absolutely loved Augustus; he is now one of my favorite male characters) that I felt like they were real people, though definitely a bit different than most of your \\"normal\\" teens -- the author explored the idea that they were different in a unique way, and I think he managed to capture that part in all of us that feels strange and unworthy when compared to others, and that hates that difference. The characters grew throughout the novel, and their romance was sweet and slow and thoughtful. I also liked how the characters were honest with one another and their peers/parents, and how the emotions were raw and realistic for the situation.<br /><br />I liked how the book was about a girl with an illness, but how it was also about so much more. It started off focusing on her cancer, and as time went on, it didn't shy away from it, but more aspects of her life -- and what would happen after she eventually died -- came to life as the story went on. It was a very honest approach that was really nice to read, though it was also heartbreaking at times.<br /><br />There were a few things that I didn't like about this book. One was the writing style. The characters were intelligent, but half of the time, they didn't speak like it. They would transition from talking like a well-educated adult to talking like an average teen, and though it kept the story honest, because the characters are teenagers, it also threw my reading off, because it didn't seem to fit with the rest of what they were saying.<br /><br />Another con was the way that the book was presented in some circumstances. This is definitely a book that will make you think, but half of the time I didn't feel like it showed you the whole picture -- or what the whole picture could be -- and quite a few of the reflections were a bit morbid.<br /><br />My last con was the ending. It was very abrupt, and for me, it didn't seem like the book had really ended. I'm not sure if the author did this on purpose (SPOILER: in the book, the main character's favorite-ish author ended his book, her favorite, abruptly to prove a point), but I felt like the real ending was missing, and was a bit disappointed that the book didn't go on a little bit further.<br />All in all, this was an enjoyable book, though it was definitely a sad one. It made me think, and I really liked the characters, but I wouldn't recommend it for those who like lighter, happier (or even uplifting) stories.

It was very abrupt, and for me, it didn't seem like the book had really ended. I'm not sure if the author did this on purpose (SPOILER: in the book, the main character's favorite-ish author ended his book, her favorite, abruptly to prove a point), but I felt like the real ending was missing, and was a bit disappointed that the book didn't go on a little bit further.<br />All in all, this was an enjoyable book, though it was definitely a sad one.

B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I have to start of saying that I really was nervous about reading this book, because I wasn't completely satisfied with the first book Matched. However since I had already invested a week into reading Matched, I wasn't going to give up the chance to have it redeem itself in Crossed. And boy am I glad that I did.  Crossed is a much stronger book in my opinion. I absolutely LOVED the alternate point of view narration. It threw me off at first, but I have now realized that I actual like this type of narration in books like these because it gives sooo much more depth to the characters I'm investing my time in.  In Crossed we learn more about who Ky is and where he came from and a lot of the mysteries are solved regarding him. Cassia becomes a much stronger character with her determination to find Ky and to be with him. What she overcomes from the beginning of the book thru it to the end make me relate to her far much more then in Matched.  When the book ended I was satisfied and highly anticipating the rest of the story..
B0064NTZQ2|3.0|Some really excellent driving, and sudden, loud, powerful violence. Perfect for those of us who like torque and recoil, but marred by a stupid and senseless ending. There was also the problem of the driver ramming a couple of cars - sending one flying through the air - without making his radiator leak, or even breaking a headlight. Watch it for the action, it does not have to make sense.

1439192812|5.0|This book is a real 'page turner' for readers of all ages.  Each of the 12 chapters of this roughly 250-page book (large print with many illustrations) covers an aspect of the real world. The chapters begin with the folklore or religious explanations, and then presents the reality of the situation, as uncovered by the cumulative application of the scientific method.  The 'magic' as Richard Dawkins puts it, is the fascinating reality that underlies the phenomena discussed. Professor Dawkins is a master teacher!  Would that every curious person read this book; they would be well rewarded.

Also Booth has been through child birth before.  His over protection is very irritating to me. Temperance is a strong woman who can take care of herself. (this fact has always bothered me from the start) And being a college educated Booth cannot possibly be as ignorant as the writers have portrayed him.  His grammar is awful.  For example \\"This here\\" is my partner\\". I think David should pay more attention to how they are portraying Booth.  I really like the show but is this continues \\"not so much\\"

B00004RF9B|4.0|\\"Forbidden Planet\\", created at MGM in 1956, was a high-budget high-concept science fiction film among the many low-budget sci-fi flicks made for drive-in theaters in that decade. It doesn't possess the intellectualism of \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\", nor does it hold up as well, but the two films have common themes. Cdr. John Adams (Leslie Nielsen) leads a mission to the planet Altair-4, where an expedition landed 20 years before and has not been heard from since. His ship is warned away by Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), a survivor of the earlier mission. Morbius explains the violent fate met by his colleagues and urges the visitors to leave. Only Morbius and his comely daughter Altaira (Ann Francis) have survived and thrived. Now aware of the disaster, Adams must await instructions from Earth. But some invisible threat still lurks on the planet.<br /><br />It was probably the film's brightly colored Cinemscope, friendly robot Robby, and neat-o special effects that most impressed audiences when it was released, but I was struck by \\"Forbidden Planet\\"s obvious influence on subsequent science fiction films and television. The impact on Gene Roddenberry's \\"Star Trek\\" was substantial, right down to the costumes, the communicators, and, of course, the allegory -though Roddenberry was decidedly more optimistic. \\"Forbidden Planet\\" posits that technology and knowledge do not fundamentally change people. A species cannot grow out of its violent primitivism. A gloomy message for a big, colorful, sci-fi adventure. I don't know what to make of the acting style, which I found peculiarly wooden. But this is a must-see for science fiction fans, if only because it is so recognizable in retrospect.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner 2000): This disc is two-sided, with full screen on one side and widescreen on the other. The print is perfectly watchable but not clean. There are white specks. A theatrical trailer (4 min) is included.

1849514003|4.0|Cocos2d for iPhone is a typical cookbook. That means you will find here lots of recipes useful during iPhone development. Book is well structured. Each chapter is devoted to different aspect of development. There are topics covering basic topics like simple graphics manipulation but also cover physics related ones. One remark here. Not all topics are strictly related to Cocos2d. It can be slightly misleading by tittle that implies Cocos2d library will be discussed in the book. For example JSON, XML and PLIST are covered by TouchJSON, GDataXML and Cocoa libraries respectively. The same refers to SQLite related topics. You could argue whether this kind of topics should be put into book devoted to Cocos2d - no matter what, tittle suggests it is strictly graphics related. On the other hand, maybe it can be useful as sooner or later you will face these issues during game development.<br /><br />What I liked about the book? The structure of the recipes. They are nearly identical and you always know what to expect. At first, you get the description of the problem, how to prepare the environment, and eventually how to code the solution. There is also an explanation of how and why everything works. From time to time you will also find \\"there is more\\" section that points to valuable resources.<br /><br />What I didn't like? I think there are too much source code in the book. I know it is easier to read when you have the code in front of you, but I am pretty sure that most of the people will use the book together with their laptops and XCode running aside. So, in my opinion, basing on example source codes would be just fine. And the book would occupy less place on the book shelf.<br /><br />Anyway, I think it is worth considering to by this book (at least e-book format) just to have some nice recipes by you hand. Not all of them are applicable in each case, but still, they cover quite a loot of topics.

B004J4WKTW|3.0|I don't normally read fantasy, but this would be the type of fantasy book I would read. Similar to Harry Potter in that there is magic and some of the book is very made up, but it takes place in a real setting.  I only gave this book three stars. While I was intrigued with the whole idea, the book just didn't grab me and keep hold of me through to the end.  I liked the characters the author developed. My favorite were the Murray twins and their interaction with Bailey. They were a lot of fun and the descriptions of them, their antics and the journeys did keep me entertained. I was shocked with Bailey and the ending of the story. I liked the game that was to be had, but it was a little confusing. I guess it was also confusing to the participants.  I guess what I didn't like was all the detail of the meetings. It did seem like those just carried on and didn't serve a great purpose to the story. I didn't hate the book, just wasn't as entertained.  Verdict: Give it a try. I know I will later try it in audio format. The book is read by Jim Dale (known from Harry Potter readings) and I hope this may give the book the flair I am looking for. I would give the cover 5 stars. This did help me to visualize the circus. Awesome cover.

0142428256|3.0|Don't get confused. This story is told from Adam's point of view and also begins three years after the accident. I expected it to begin where the prior book left off. So beginning the story, I was confused and did not like the book. I kept persevering, because where are you going to go listening to this in the car, and was glad I did.  As the ideas began to come together in my head and I got to the point in the story where it all started making sense, I enjoyed the book. I liked the relationships and feelings that were explored after the accident. Between Adam and his \\"girlfriend\\", how Adam felt when he saw Mia for the first time, the things Mia said to Adam after meeting since the accident. These ideas made me think about all sides and all persons touched by accidents.  The last paragraph makes the book sound heavy, but it is not. It's a short and enjoyable read.  I did like the narrator. He did not do extreme voice changes for characters and so sometimes that was a little confusing when you thought it was still Adam talking. He did have inflection and was enjoyable to listen to. Trying to do more audio books to get used to listening and this was a good pick.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|I've played games like Myst and Riven on my PC, although I had to refer to walkthroughs for many of the puzzles. \\"The Lost City\\" is the first graphical adventure game that I've played on my Kindle Fire, and I'm impressed. I'm working my way through the game now. Although I've used a couple of hints, the puzzles and problems are challenging but are manageable. The graphics are attractive enough to make me look forward to moving on through the colorful landscape, collecting objects and figuring where and how to use them.<br /><br />My only negative comment is that a help screen or brief tutorial would have been welcomed. Initially, it took me a half-hour or so to figure out how to navigate and move around from screen to screen.<br /><br />Overall, The Lost City looks like a challenging and fun game that should please even the most demanding fans of video adventure games.
0307949435|5.0|Gary Taubes is the knight in shining armour who finally comes to the aid of distressed dieters who are told \\"eat less and exercise more\\" and despised for having weak self control by the medical fraternity and left to get fatter and fatter until they are obese and face diabetes, heart problems, cancer and a host of other diseases which he coins \\"Western diseases\\".  The reader finally finds an ally that he is not alone in thinking he is out of control with his eating and why.  Mr Taubes turns all the known and established paradigms about weight gain like \\"calories in, calories out\\" on its head and proposes very sound arguements on how and why we have this epidemic.  It is a deep and thoughtful book which has taken him many years to research and write and is guaranteed along with his previous book \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\" to take the reader on a journey of discovery and intrigue which hopefully as in my case will culminate with a greater knowledge of how we can maintain a healthy weight.

B005WMQ5R8|5.0|If Amazon would let me just put a one word review, I'd leave this as \\"Perfect\\".<br /><br />Every few years there is a critical point at which an Anime is released that just blows your mind or serves as the gateway drug for a whole new generation of Anime fans. Red Line is that movie now.<br /><br />I cannot find a single flaw with this film. Everything from the first scene all the way to the dang credits is Epic. I read that it took 7 years to make this film and it shows... in the good way. It's as if the creators looked at every minute detail and finely honed them to perfection. The animation is gorgeous, fresh, and unique. The English voice acting is dead on and engrossing. The sound track and effects are mind blowing. The characters are deep and interesting. You get the point... it's that kind of movie that you never want to end and all the way to that end you're left with that last bit of suspense and excitement that drives you nuts... again, in the good way.<br /><br />If you like Anime at all, or think in the slightest bit that you could like Anime, or even if you are just a Sci-Fi or Action fan: Then there is nothing more to say. Buy this movie NOW and watch it.
0143119419|5.0|I really liked this book because it did such a nice job of telling the history of hedge funds in story form (it reminded me of Lewis, The Big Short, Liars Poker, etc). The author did *extensive* research and many interviews with the players, so the book has the ring of truth, for sure. I had to (and wanted to) read it through twice because there was so much good material.  I particularly liked the attention the author paid to the reasons why hedge funds blew up, or were hurt badly -- typically, they got hurt bad when their trades were big, when they were leveraged too much, and when they couldn't get out of crowded trades when liquidity dried up and others started trading against the dying fund.  It was also very interesting to read the author's take on whether it makes sense to regulate hedge funds more. If anything, I went into the book thinking like most laymen, that hedge funds were somewhat destabilizing and unsavory players in the market, but I came out of the book with more understanding of why hedge funds can play a positive role in the market, and why it doesn't make much sense to attempt to regulate them even more.  An excellent, educational, and thought-provoking book, IMHO.
B000003TB6|3.0|I don't know if it's just me, but I think that The Roots started to step their game up with the follow up \\"Illadelph Halflife\\". Their sound as a group was still too experimental in \\"Do YOu Want More?\\" and all over the place, \\"Illadelph Halflife\\" sounds sooo much more sophisticated! As a sophmore release \\"Do You Want More?\\" isn't bad, actually fairly good with 2-3 classic songs (Proceed, Distortion Of Static), but it's not a complete work of art, such as the majority of The Roots' later albums.  If you are new to The Roots (if that's even possible) get \\"Illadelph Halflife\\" first, then move on with \\"Things Fall Apart\\", \\"Game Theory\\" and \\"How I Got Over\\" to follow and appreciate the Roots' musical growth to perfection. If you want to complete you Roots discography you also need to get \\"Phrenology\\", \\"The Tipping Point\\"  and \\"Undun\\", one of the best Rap releases in 2011.

0307949508|2.0|Historic moments in fiction: Blomqvist refuses coffee! Fact! It happens on Page 349 of my paperback Vintage Crime edition. All kidding aside, I'm actually not bothered by all the coffee drinking in the Millennium saga; it often makes me wish I had a fresh brewed cup in my own hand.  But I do have plenty of problems with this book as a whole.<br /><br />Mild spoilers below.<br /><br />I had hopes for this installment, having been told the series gets better as it goes on. At first it seemed so. At least it didn't start with 100 pages on Swedish financial journalism. Lisbeth's new life was mildly intriguing. Back in Sweden, an actual mystery plot was introduced with the investigations into human trafficking and the double murder. And then it all got bogged down. Too many people doing the same investigation with very little to show for it. Endless repetition of facts. Pointless feuding among the police team. Or, to quote the book, \\"The three parallel investigations churned on.\\" At least twice, two people or groups arrived at the same conclusion at about the same time. Then there are innumerable characters with similar names speaking elliptically about current and past plots and events. It got so complicated that I gave up even trying to follow logically. Sometimes I wondered if the author did the same. It takes some doing to write about so many kidnappings, brutal beatings, torture, murders, hacking people with chain saws, and have it be a slow read. But so it is. Elements that should be shocking lose their impact under the sheer weight of extraneous material. I think Larsson could have dispensed with Milton Security and put the police investigation in the background, then highlighted Blomqvist and Salander separately homing in on the bad guys. The ultimate resolution of the plot is no great shakes, but could have been much more suspenseful if stripped down to essentials - and to characters we know.<br /><br />As many have commented, the characterization of Lisbeth is disappointing. In the first book, she was interesting, with special abilities but flawed and human. Here she is a cartoon superhero (though hero is perhaps the wrong word for someone so violently aggressive). She can do literally anything, boxing, breaking into any building, higher mathematics, you name it. A major error in my opinion was the way the relationship between Lisbeth and Blomqvist - one of the positives of Dragon Tattoo - was pushed to the background. Between the reimagining of Salander as a vigilante Mary Sue, and some wildly implausible plot twists, sometimes this reads like a bad fan-fic of the first book.<br /><br />I have to wonder at the publishing house that produced these books without much stricter editing. In my opinion, they did the author no favors.ok, she was interesting, with special abilities but flawed and human.

0385344228|5.0|William Landay knocked my socks off with this thriller that grabbed me from the first page and didn't let go until the last sentence.  The book shows how the judgment of the most professional people can be skewed when they get emotionally involved in their work with a relative.  Andrew Barber is an Assistant District Attorney called upon to open an investigation into the murder of a teen.  Andrew decides to take it on himself and doesn't get swayed by the fact that the victim was a student in the same school as Andrew's teen son.  When some troubling things seem to give clues pointing to his son (Jacob), Andrew brushes them away.  Even when his son becomes the prime suspect, Andrew chooses to look towards another suspect.  Andrew's actions will later come into question and he will have to defend what he did to the man who was eager to take his job.  Andrew must also confront his \\"hidden\\" past and the author brings into play the theory of a \\"murder gene\\" where the tendency to be violent is passed down from father to son through the genes.  A pure \\"tour de force.\\"  Should not be missed!

B0064NTZJO|5.0|**Update Feb 13 2012**  So I bought Drive to watch it again and felt that maybe I needed to add more to my review to make it helpful for those on the fence but I just now decided that Drive doesn't need anybody to defend it.  Either you're going to watch it or you're not.  Don't watch the trailer and don't listen to any of the reviews.  Just watch it, by yourself if you can, without distraction and don't try to analyze the movie as you watch it because you'll get lost.  Not because you're stupid or \\"don't get it\\" but because that's how it's supposed to be.  You are only a passenger on a journey with an unknown driver, so enjoy the ride for what it is.  **Old review**  I'd like to start by saying that I'm an avid movie goer and I enjoy all kinds of movies.  I usually check out the new releases the day of or the day after their release.  However, I overlooked Drive because I was under the impression it was like the Transporter.  That's right, the reason I initially passed on this movie is the same reason it has so many average or one star reviews.  Don't get me wrong the Transporter was a good movie but I wasn't interested in seeing another movie like the Transporter.  The one star reviewers had a false perception of what Drive was going to be like and once they noticed Drive ISN'T linear and one dimensional they decided to right it off as a bad movie.  I'm glad I gave Drive a chance and now it's one of my all time favorites.  If you have an open mind you'll probably enjoy this movie and if you don't enjoy this movie it's probably because you're scared of anything that's different.  Drive will be a cult classic. Oh, and the soundtrack is pretty good too.

B002ZG997C|5.0|just...man that was spectacular! do yourself a favor and pick up this movie! $7.99 is a steal!<br /><br />alright so nitty gritty, the fighting is beautiful, the choreography is perfect with every movement a seamless connection to the next. who ever was behind it was truly a pro.<br /><br />the art style is perfect, sometimes an almost black and white while other times incredibility vivid.<br /><br />the characters are great, denzel washington is both badass and hilarious at just the right times. the villain is perfect, it's the kind of guy you'd expect to take over in that kind of situation.<br /><br />the ending...is brilliant, so much foreshadowing to different parts that all amount to a twist that doesn't feel forced or out of place but exactly as it should be. (early on in the film there was a moment where I thought \\"why would he do that?\\" and soon after forgot about it only for it to become strikingly clear why he did it once the film is concluded.)<br /><br />I know I'm gushing a lot but I watched this movie over twelve hours ago and I'm still like this, it's a movie that after it ends leaves you happy to find that there's an animated comic book video on the DVD as a bonus feature.<br /><br />overall if you want to watch a good movie you will not be disappointed.

B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I love the movie-after watching it for the 100th time recently i wondered \\"Does it have a sound track to it\\" because the music is a big part of the movie and i'm happy to say the soundtrack is as good as the movie-maybe even better!!!!!

B005QI4TP8|4.0|There are a handful of artists whose albums/new sonic journeys i wait for, I've added F + M to that list now, And even increasingly fewer modern artists put out an album that deserves listening to in its entirety. F+M are on that one too.   I think this music is someone everyone can find a connection with , the composition repertoire is so vast and F+M have only made two albums.wow. each song, even if you don't like it in your first go,  just keep listening till its over, the arrangements here are bound to creep into you and F+M have this uncanny ability to etch themselves into your head. Lungs was the greatest debut album since Jeff Buckley , this one goes into different territory but its beautiful still the same. And Oh God that voice and what she can do with it. Florence totally uses it not to sing her lyrics but as an instrument on its own.  I only give 4 stars because the way this band is going, a 5 star is down the line...they haven't hit their peak yet...but 4 for a second album is like a diamond on its own.  =
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I couldn't stop reading this, once I started.  I can't believe that this young woman is as well-adjusted as she is after such an atrocity was put upon her at such a tender age.  She made the best of what she had, and made a home of what she had to work with. Hopefully, her daughters won't have a terrible legacy from this in what remains of their formative years.  She had instincts of a person much older, and a maternal instinct to nurture her children, while trying to make the best of what she thought she'd have to live with forever.  I'm so glad that she and her children survived under the \\"care\\" of this disgusting man and his enabling (equally as guilty) wife.
B003L77GHE|5.0|I have just recently watched both seasons of Vampire Diaries, and have to say it was worth the price! I couldn't stop watching it!! 5 Star rating on my end. You get your fiction of Vampires, wolfs, and witches, you get romance and action fighting too! I love it!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What a great life!!  I gained much more understanding of what the lives of these hero's are like. These men are great, and Chris Kyle is an excellent example of what a true warrior is.
0375507256|5.0|The Cloud Atlas is one of those highly recommended novels, where ever you turn someone else is raving about it and recommending it. The more a book is recommended the more worried I get that it will disappoint. David Mitchell was even at the Auckland Readers & Writers Festival last year, I know because my copy of the book was signed, however I canft remember if I heard him talk.  All I knew was the book was about six lives that spanned a time frame from 1850s to a post-apocalyptic future. I was not convinced so it languished on my to read pile for almost a year.<br /><br />Over the summer I finished my Christmas reading and decided it was time to check The Cloud Atlas off my to read list.<br /><br />I was so surprised this book is very delightfully unusual and fresh. I felt like I was being drawn along on this gossamer thread, being lured into the story. I blindly followed the thread and as each step revealed another question, another mystery, another desire that I read on if only to discover more. Each characters life was a delightful taste, just enough to intrigue and capture the reader. I could tell you more but the shape of the story was a delightful revelation and I would hate to spoil any of the magic. Just know that as I finally closed the last pages I was satisfied and content.<br /><br />This is an unusual book that if you let yourself be drawn in (the first chapter is the hardest, it gets fun after that)  I guarantee you will be enraptured.
B003YBUSMW|1.0|I am returning this Steering Wheel for a full refund. It is unusable for any racing game and I have the latest version of Forza (among quite a few others).  The problem is that this Mad Catz Steering Wheel has a large deadband before the XBOX360 responds to the steering wheel. That means that you have to turn the wheel almost 1/4 turn in either direction before the car (in the game) will respond. That makes it completely useless for any racing game. I compared it to the Microsoft wireless controller and the Microsoft does not have the problem (with the joystick).  I wrote a service ticket at Mad Catz. A week later I still had no response at all. I contacted Mad Catz and they didn't seem to care. I described the problem and their answer was that I should send it back at my expense. Then they will determine if there is a problem and if not then it will cost me to get it shipped back. I think that whomever I talked to wasn't even sure what I was talking about. I'm not paying to ship a defective product back. At least Amazon will let me ship a defective product back and pay for the shipping. And since I am not willing to risk getting another one with same problem, I'm going for the full refund.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|[[ASIN:B005HSG3TC Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware, Graphite]  i couldn't be happier with my kindle fire microshell folio cover by marware.  it does a great job of protecting my kindle.  it has a very low profile and adds almost nothing to the size and weight.  it's very easy to use.  the cover folds back very well when the kindle is in use, and stays in place.  i love the fact that it can also create a stand for the kindle and holds it upright.  i've used the feature to watch videos and play games.  i would definitely recommend this cover to anyone looking for a cover for their kindle.  i now feel as if i can take my kindle fire anywhere, without worrying about damage or scratches. it was well worth the price.
0375851569|5.0|When we had our first baby we received several newly-published children's books as gifts.  We read them to our son but neither we nor he seemed to like them very much.  I ordered these and started reading them to him, and immediately noticed a huge difference.  We and our son love the rhyming language and crazy illustrations.  The Seuss books are about twice as long as today's children's books.  Our son, who is 21 months old, loses interest about 2/3 of the way through.  However I expect his attention span will grow, and these books will reward that extra attention.  Furthermore, I think he can continue enjoying these books for a few years, including after he learns to read them himself.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|This movie was shockingly good all my female friends liked it just cause of hugh jackman. The story plot is above average and this was a good future plot with out to much futureness in it. Love that it started in texas. So a man scared of father hood and having a son then a robot and then heart felt warm stuff happens and then the ending of this movie is amazing. I tried to leave out the spoilers sorry if the review don't make that much sense but best thing WATCH THE MOVIE its worth the two hours involved just to see it develp and the end of the movie. Its like a robot rocky movie kind of even if that gives away the ending sorry.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Quite simply a masterpiece by the master. His voice is still as deep and soulful as it has ever been. The songwriting and arrangements are superb.  This along with Live in London is the best music Leonard Cohen has made in years.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|I recently purchased this watch from Amazon.com when they were having a watch sale. During that period and even now I notice that the price on this product does fluctuate now and then if a supplier changes or really whenever. I saw this between $55 and $85.<br /><br />The packaging was typical Amazon packaging. The watch comes in a temporary sleeve. The blue box was in good shape with a UPC label on the front.<br /><br />Inside the box the watch 'sits on a pillow'. The watch was already running on arrival. Inside the box there was NO warranty card that should already be filled out by Amazon before they ship it (just keep proof of purchase). The only thing in the box was this two-fold generic instruction manual. I personally would also liked to have known the manufacture date.<br /><br />The watch itself is the right size for any 'normal' wrist size. For people with a wrist leaning to the larger size this watch could be smaller than desired. The day date feature works fine. I still have to get used to of the 5 10 20 clock face. Setting the time can be tricky at first but it is easy to adapt to. The watch does stay luminescent for some time but arguably not long enough or distinguishable enough for any real use. The strap and buckle seem loose but alright. The end is starting to fray with one loose strand (t<1mo). I personally enjoy the glass case from time to time being able to see the mechanics. The movement is from Malaysia (7S26C) not Japan but nevertheless it seems to keep time well enough, for now. The manual wind is by shaking the watch and the crown is at 20, which is nice. The reserve is near 36 hours as listed and I suggest shaking the watch on each weekend morning if you won't wear it. Some people said the watch makes some noise and I guess but who notices that.<br /><br />The look of the watch overall is minimalist, in my opinion and I like it this way. Its an everyday watch that I feel can be worn anywhere.<br /><br />The watch itself ran 10 seconds slowafter the first 24 hours out of the box. On average the watch loses 5 to 6 seconds per day so far. It seems I could open the watch casing and adjust the beats to get better accuracy but I am not inclined to do that. I don't have any comments on consistency.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Good look<br />-Not too big<br />-No battery<br />-Price was alright. Under $60!<br />-Amazon.com as seller<br /><br />CONS<br />-NOT Japanese movement<br />-OK quality<br />-Labels 10 20 50 55<br /><br />Personally, the watch was not right for me so I returned it as I was not ready to adjust the watch myself. I would still recommend this.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Totally worth the dollar!! If you dont have it already....GET IT NOW!!! You wont be disappointed! Cant wait to tell my friends:-)
B006OT03BM|5.0|This Limited Collector's Edition is the must have for the Transformers Fanboy or a fan of the movie trilogy. This set is awesome and comes with all three movies on blu-ray (which looks amazing by the way) and Dark of the Moon on 3D blu-ray. It also comes with a movie plaque that contains 4 movie film cells from the movies. The plaque is also HAND SIGNED by director Michael Bay which is an added bonus to the set. The case looks awesome as well. Other than not having any of the DVDs or digital copies of all three movies, I completely love this trilogy set as I am a huge movie buff. Also they only made 5000 of these things so I'm glad I got one. I highly recommend this blu-ray set for any movie buff or Transformer fan.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The complete Harry Potter collection of DVDs is a phenomenal addition to my DVD collection. Loved that they came in a singular case and that each was available as part of the set.
B005NF2UE6|3.0|This album is a good listen but if you were looking for something different from the last two albums you won't find it.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|The best Bible app around. Better than a lot of the paid apps with plenty of resources and reading plans.
B006ZDS7CE|1.0|While her voice has some interesting characteristics, she simply isn't the artist Lana Del Rey.  Nepotism rules our world and thanks to her rich daddy we get Ms. Grant's  alter-ego singing of a life that was never hers.  For this reasons she absolutely never connects with her songs and it's a total miss.  I love indie and alternative, but not when it's disingenuous and fake.<br /><br />If there has ever been a fake hipster album - this is it.
0439023491|5.0|I ordered this book as soon as I finished the first one on my Kindle Fire. I read the first one and this one within a week. It is a little slower to get into than the first one. However some events I did not see coming. I hope they make a movie out of this one. You really get to see more into the characters and what they are like. I caught myself wishing things would happen between some of the characters.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Drive is an amazing example that film isn't quite dead in Hollywood. Original, understated, shocking, and beautiful describe this modern masterpiece.  Ryan Gosling plays a stunt driver by day and a wheel man for hire at night. He gets caught up with the mob and eventually has to go on a violent spree to protect his neighbor (Carey Mulligan), who he cares about. The cast is great. Fine performances by Albert Brooks and Bryan Cranston highlight their talent well. The score/soundtrack fits perfectly with Drive's film noir style. What makes this film so great is its Zen like simplicity. A straight story line, minimal dialogue, and great use of camera shots make Drive seem somewhat like a surreal experience, using LA as a backdrop. Too many films are guilty of non-stop fake action, a bazillion screen shots, and retarded one-liners. Fast and Furious or Transformers anyone? Finally a film that seeps slowly and lets the scenes take a more natural shape, like real life does. The violence in drive is of the hyper variety, but real in every sense. It comes out of nowhere and is shocking to the mind and eyes. Not sensationalized like Tarantino, but like a blunt object that is indifferent to its viewers. This film is not for everyone to enjoy. Many reviewers will complain about its slower pacing, minimal dialogue, and lack of action sequences. I thought it was a breath of fresh air compared to the pure crap hollywood has conditioned us to. This was a unique film that will, over time, be in the hidden gem class of films like Gattaca, Point Blank (lee Marvin), and Le Man.
0439023521|5.0|This was the first book I got on my new Kindle Fire and it was amazing! I never thought I would like it because it is set far in the future even after my sister in law told me about it. I saw the commerical for the movie coming out in March and decided to read it. WOW was I wrong! I couldn't put it down. Great read for all ages. I suggest this book to anyone, it keeps you one you toes wanting to stop after the next chapter every time!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this. game well it st least gives me a willing ti keep playing it constantly so I would like t
B000002QWD|5.0|The wife and I both love the movie and it was great to have the music. I have to admit that it didn't make it to the stocking. I knew that she  would love to listen to it so it got opened a little early but it was perfect timing.
0525478817|5.0|On the cover a guy says that its a staccato of humor and tragedy. I truly cannot find a better way of putting it. In one chapter I went from crying from laughter to holding a lump in my throat to try not to cry to then finally letting go. I am certainly going to reread it to make notes on sections I want to tell others about or quotes I like. If your thinking about this book just get it...right now.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these games are really awesome. though the controls are very clunky... otherwises its a good app l.   mostly worth the price though FREE
B0053YGYO4|4.0|The cd came in the right time. We like it a lot the only thing is that there was a little piece of the case that was broken but the cd was perfect.
B00656C6KK|5.0|I bought this CD of Doris Day for my Sister-in-law and she loves it.  She has played the CD continuous since it arrived.  Doris Day is a wonderful entertainer and a great animal lover.  I recommend it.
B001PJRAUS|3.0|If you like light, fun romantic comedies, and you don't take yourself seriously, then you'll really like this. They put into film what many of us have wondered: what would it be like to be a character from your favorite book (or movie)?  I won't go into the details as many other review have plot summaries, but I will comment on something that really bugged me about the dvd release. I have no idea why they did it, but they cut out some scenes from the original tv release. I can't recall all the scenes cut, but the one that bugged me the most was the scene where Amanda sings for Darcy et all at Netherfield Park. It went straight from dinner to them clapping for her. It was a great scene and shouldn't have been cut! If it was due to space limits, I'd rather they cut some of the behind the scenes or here's an idea, add a second disc.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|must have app for smartphones and tablets. easy to create and browse my notes. great for event schedules, shopping list, things to do list, meeting notes, etc. and you can also look it up on your internet browser.

B006BDHAX0|3.0|No shut down issues for me, but this game is a huge space user, and therefore a wifi only download. Hey apple, thanks for screwing that one up for us. I have 4G LTE for a reason...it makes faster downloads. Sheesh. Fun puzzles, but the small size of tiles gets a but draining on the eyes, and they are a little repetitive.
B004EPZ02A|5.0|With all the negative fluff floating around about this movie I think people do not appreciate that this third movie in the series is far better than the previous two. More suspense and plot is driven out and fills in the gaps with eerie moments. Don't listen to the naysayers! Give this movie a shot!
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spiderman is one of our favorites.  Not a huge fan of 2 but one and three are the best!  DVD I got was in great used condition!

B005SV9X22|5.0|I LOVE this DVD. After having gone to the Monster Ball twice, this DVD really captures the essence of Lady Gaga's live show. Her raw talent and eccentricities are two things you certainly don't wanna miss... and this DVD certainly displays both of those! Whether you're a person just discovering Gaga's music, or a hardcore Little Monster -- you should DEFINITELY consider adding this DVD to your collection. PAWS UP!

1612130283|3.0|By now most of you have heard about the hoopla surrounding the very popular Fifty Shades trilogy by E.L. James. Fifty Shades of Grey has an astounding 4,300 reviews on Goodreads and all three books are currently the top three best selling digital books on Amazon for erotica. There's also quite some controversy surrounding E.L., this series and how it was published. From what I understand, Fifty Shades of Grey was originally titled, Master of the Universe and was Twilight fan fiction. The Twilight fan fic readers became obsessed with this book (and what's now the second and third book, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed) that E.L. decided to publish it, or Writer's House Coffee Shop Publishing approached E.L. to publish it with them. Fifty Shades of Grey has sold more than 30,000 copies sold since May 2011 (at $10 a pop for an ebook, this confounds me).<br /><br />The phenomenon surrounding this trilogy is both incredible and scary. I can promise you because of the popularity of the Fifty Shades trilogy, you'll see more of these stories blatantly based on fan fiction being published in the coming years that will most likely sell well. Writers publishing fan fiction as original fiction isn't something new. Take a look at all the sequels and sometimes annoying retelling's of Pride and Prejudice as an example. But that's allowed because Pride and Prejudice is a free domain book. Writing and selling fan fiction based on Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series isn't free domain and it gets sketchy because of the issue of copyright. But I have to hand it to E.L. Because of the obsessive nature of Twilight fans, she took her story to a platform, knowing if she invoked Meyer's characters and inserted them in her own story (even if she used the names like Edward, Jacob, Bella and so forth) regardless if her own characters were no where near Meyer's characters in terms of personality or character traits, she'd have a hit on her hand.<br /><br />It's been awhile since a series made me roll my eyes and felt such raging annoyance over the actions of two characters. The last time I felt this way was while I read Karen Marie Moning's Fever series and the character of Jericho \\"Le Douche\\" Barrons. James's Christian Grey isn't a Barrons (thank God), and very early on I couldn't help but compare Christian to Roarke from JD Robb's In Death series. But the only comparison between Christian and Roarke is that these two men are incredibly handsome and rich. Christian is a disturbed megalomaniac, while Roarke doesn't need any form of therapy and  is everything a hero and man should be that women should proudly admit they're attracted to.<br /><br />Since Fifty Shades of Grey is based on Twilight, I really thought it would be exactly like Twilight, sans the paranormal element. Other than Ana accepting Christian and all his faults, much like Bella does with Edward, and the Pacific Northeast setting, I can't see any other comparisons between Fifty and Twilight. Fifty Shades of Grey is a Harlequin Presents on over the top crack that combines the characters and plot of the 1986's cult classic soft porn- 9 ½ Weeks. (I would be very surprised if E.L. said she never saw 9 ½ Weeks because the comparisons are so glaring) The way Christian Grey is portrayed reminded me of Mickey Rourke's John who seduces and almost destroys Kim Basinger's Elizabeth with his unhealthy sexual kinks.<br /><br />Christian Grey is one unhealthy minded individual all because of his past. His mother was a crack whore and Christian was a victim of her pimp who abused him physically and possibly sexually. Christian is saved and adopted by a married couple who gives him a nurturing and loving home where he can overcome his abuse. At fifteen, Christian ends up having a pedophilic, S&M relationship with one of his mother's friends. From that five year sexual relationship, Christian becomes even more unstable with his sexual desires. The only way he can find sexual gratification is through BDSM or types of kinkery f'ery as he calls it. Christian fully admits he's fifty shades of f'ed up. But even though Christian is emotionally and mentally unstable (he doesn't like to be touched) he goes on to do great things. By the age of twenty-seven he's extremely rich, powerful and runs his own company. Women fall at his feet, but because he's never had a long term relationship with a woman, his family, who loves and adores him (his parents and a younger brother and sister) assumes he's gay.<br /><br />When Fifty Shades of Grey begins we meet Anastasia Steele, a soon to be college graduate who hopes to get a job in publishing. Her roommate Kate was scheduled to interview Christian Grey, the CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc, but since Kate is sick, Ana will do it in her stead. And from Ana's meeting with Christian, her life will become a wacked out smutty version of Alice down the rabbit hole. The moment Christian meets Ana, he decides there's something special about her and wants her for his own. Ana's a virgin who doesn't realize how beautiful she is. Every man she comes in contact with lusts after her. Christian lusts after Ana also, but his lusting is more of the obsessive kind. Christian wants Ana to be his latest conquest and become his sexual submissive. Ana at first is wary of Christian because he's too overpowering, seductive and dares to woe her with his fortune and amazing knowledge of wine and force feeding her because she doesn't eat and Christian hates that (his crack ho mommy starved him as a kid and his charitable self longs to make hungry people around the world have enough nourishment). But when a richer than Midas, hot as sin, brooding male wants to give you the world and allow you to walk on the wild side with him as a f'ed up form of therapy, what's a woman like Ana to do?<br /><br />Ana accepts Christian but with some reservations. Ana is new territory for Christian and even though he wants to eat her up and spit her out, he tries his best to treat her with care. The first time they make love is near perfect.This love scene zings with smoldering emotion and hotness. But then Christian tells Ana he can't stick with the vanilla and in order for them to be together she has to be open to his dark BDSM side where he wants to hurt her in order to find satisfaction. He lays it all out on the line and through emails and a not so legal binding contract, it's up to Ana to accept the terms and let Christian have complete ownership of her body, heart and soul.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey deals with Ana accepting Christian and allowing Christian to own her. Fifty Shades of Grey is pure crack reading. I couldn't get enough of it even with the massive length and lack of editing that's desperately needed. Christian does walk that fine line and we get a small taste of how unsettling he is. But when Ana allows Christian to unleash his disturbing kinkery on her, it's all vanilla, the one thing Christian is against. The build up and final outcome is weak. The most BDSM Ana experiences by Christian's hands is bondage and a belt he uses to smack her ass that leads to her walking out on him. This is all after a much heated discussion about Christian using a cane on Ana. I was expecting something right out of movie, Pulp Fiction and the scene where they bring out the leather covered, gagged-ball gimp. (If you seen Pulp Fiction, then you know exactly what I mean).<br /><br />Katiebabscalls it. Christian fully admits he's fifty shades of f'ed up. But even though Christian is emotionally and mentally unstable (he doesn't like to be touched) he goes on to do great things. By the age of twenty-seven he's extremely rich, powerful and runs his own company. Women fall at his feet, but because he's never had a long term relationship with a woman, his family, who loves and adores him (his parents and a younger brother and sister) assumes he's gay.  When Fifty Shades of Grey begins we meet Anastasia Steele, a soon to be college graduate who hopes to get a job in publishing. Her roommate Kate was scheduled to interview Christian Grey, the CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings, Inc, but since Kate is sick, Ana will do it in her stead. And from Ana's meeting with Christian, her life will become a wacked out smutty version of Alice down the rabbit hole. The moment Christian meets Ana, he decides there's something special about her and wants her for his own. Ana's a virgin who doesn't realize how beautiful she is. Every man she comes in contact with lusts after her. Christian lusts after Ana also, but his lusting is more of the obsessive kind. Christian wants Ana to be his latest conquest and become his sexual submissive. Ana at first is wary of Christian because he's too overpowering, seductive and dares to woe her with his fortune and amazing knowledge of wine and force feeding her because she doesn't eat and Christian hates that (his crack ho mommy starved him as a kid and his charitable self longs to make hungry people around the world have enough nourishment). But when a richer than Midas, hot as sin, brooding male wants to give you the world and allow you to walk on the wild side with him as a f'ed up form of therapy, what's a woman like Ana to do?  Ana accepts Christian but with some reservations. Ana is new territory for Christian and even though he wants to eat her up and spit her out, he tries his best to treat her with care. The first time they make loveis near perfect.This love scene zings with smoldering emotion and hotness. But then Christian tells Ana he can't stick with the vanilla and in order for them to be together she has to be open to his dark BDSM side where he wants to hurt her in order to find satisfaction. He lays it all out on the line and through emails and a not so legal binding contract, it's up to Ana to accept the terms and let Christian have complete ownership of her body, heart and soul.  Fifty Shades of Grey deals with Ana accepting Christian and allowing Christian to own her. Fifty Shades of Grey is pure crack reading. I couldn't get enough of it even with the massive length and lack of editing that's desperately needed. Christian does walk that fine line and we get a small taste of how unsettling he is. But when Ana allows Christian to unleash his disturbing kinkery on her, it's all vanilla, the one thing Christian is against. The build up and final outcome is weak. The most BDSM Ana experiences by Christian's hands is bondage and a belt he uses to smack her ass that leads to her walking out on him. This is all after a much heated discussion about Christian using a cane on Ana. I was expecting something right out of movie, Pulp Fiction and the scene where they bring out the leather covered, gagged-ball gimp. (If you seen Pulp Fiction, then you know exactly what I mean).

B006ZBRMOU|1.0|By the time I started reading Freed, I was pretty much bored with Christian and Ana's emo issues. Ana thinks Christian is scary because of the way he reacts to her, especially when she doesn't behave. Christian threatens to beat the sh_t out of Ana when she dares to have more than one drink with Kate at some club while he's away for a night and can't keep watch over her. Christian uses verbal threats to the point of overkill. He's all bluster and talk and never does more than that. Christian comes across more as a spoiled rich boy who has tantrums when he doesn't get his way. Why Ana is so attractive to him stupefies me. So what if he's rich and handsome? What else does he have to recommend for himself? He uses threats as scare tactics that never go anywhere and his issues and depravity we're told about never come to completion.<br /><br />When all is said and done, the reader has been taken on a snooze worthy ride that doesn't deliver. This trilogy is more like riding in a bumper car at an amusement park.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Freed is the perfect example of every stereotypical semi-erotic romance. The amount of times Ana breaks down in tears because Christian is so mean and the mentions of channeling her inner goddess when she has sex with him made me want to strangle her. Everything here is like an ice cream sundae with gummy bears on top because it's sickly sweet.<br /><br />And don't get me started on the lameness of the ending and the care bear epilogue.<br /><br />I really can't understand why this trilogy has the massive fan base. Everything introduced from the characteristics of Christian and Ana to the lacking suspense and action is nothing new. The reading community at large has been conned and doesn't seem to care.<br /><br />The HEA here isn't believable and the romance a poor substitute of what a real romance novel should be. To me, a romance is all about empowerment and strengthening the main couple. If the hero or heroine walks out on the relationship, the author hopefully has done a good enough job where you believe both main characters will carry on with their lives and be a better person for knowing one another. E.L. James has failed miserably with this trilogy. While I believe Ana would be able to survive without Christian, I can't say the same with him. Christian would end up making Ana's life miserable and becoming a true, psychotic stalker in every sense of the word where their ending would be a murder suicide that brings to mind another movie from the 80's- Star 80.<br /><br />Katiebabsob where you believe both main characters will carry on with their lives and be a better person for knowing one another.

B004LWZWBU|1.0|You'd think a comedy starring Steve Martin, Owen Wilson, and Jack Black would be pretty funny, if not uproariously hilarious, especially when the film is centered around competitive bird watching. Based on the book by Mark Obmascik, The Big Year actually hopes to accomplish a bit more depth, but it largely falls flat. At various crossroads in their lives, Stu, Brad, and Kenny embark on a cross-country trip in hopes of spotting the most bird species in North America; along the way, they each discover enough about themselves to move on. Directed by David Frankel, The Big Year certainly cares about its characters, but I felt the film had little forward motion, and its surprising lack of humor made it feel all the more stagnant. If you're into self discovery movies, you might enjoy this; just don't expect to laugh much.
1612130585|1.0|By now most of you have heard about the hoopla surrounding the very popular Fifty Shades trilogy by E.L. James. Fifty Shades of Grey has an astounding 4,300 reviews on Goodreads and all three books are currently the top three best selling digital books on Amazon for erotica. There's also quite some controversy surrounding E.L., this series and how it was published. From what I understand, Fifty Shades of Grey was originally titled, Master of the Universe and was Twilight fan fiction. The Twilight fan fic readers became obsessed with this book (and what's now the second and third book, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed) that E.L. decided to publish it, or Writer's House Coffee Shop Publishing approached E.L. to publish it with them. Fifty Shades of Grey has sold more than 30,000 copies sold since May 2011 (at $10 a pop for an ebook, this confounds me).<br /><br />The phenomenon surrounding this trilogy is both incredible and scary. I can promise you because of the popularity of the Fifty Shades trilogy, you'll see more of these stories blatantly based on fan fiction being published in the coming years that will most likely sell well. Writers publishing fan fiction as original fiction isn't something new. Take a look at all the sequels and sometimes annoying retelling's of Pride and Prejudice as an example. But that's allowed because Pride and Prejudice is a free domain book. Writing and selling fan fiction based on Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series isn't free domain and it gets sketchy because of the issue of copyright. But I have to hand it to E.L. Because of the obsessive nature of Twilight fans, she took her story to a platform, knowing if she invoked Meyer's characters and inserted them in her own story (even if she used the names like Edward, Jacob, Bella and so forth) regardless if her own characters were no where near Meyer's characters in terms of personality or character traits, she'd have a hit on her hand.<br /><br />The second book, Fifty Shades Darker is pretty much a rehash of the first book. Only after three days from when Ana has left Christian, they're back together. Again Ana must decide if she'll be the willing victim to Christian's sexual depravity while Christian courts her with outlandish gifts and using manipulation to get what he wants. But now Ana is dealing with a sexual predator of a boss who wants to destroy Christian. The reason for this is revealed in the third book, Fifty Shades Freed where Christian and Ana are now married and Ana's ex-boss is out to for revenge against them both.<br /><br />Darker loses some major momentum and doesn't have the addicting crack factor like the first book had.<br /><br />Katiebabsh a rehash of the first book.

B0062P3392|1.0|Jason Statham quickly went from witty Guy Ritchie discovery to fully fledged action star, so much so that he even earned a spot in the distinguished, testosterone-fueled lineup of Sylvester Stallone's Expendables franchise. Unfortunately, I have only liked a few of Statham's starring vehicles. Enter Killer Elite, which teamed Statham with the legendary Robert De Niro and \\"why isn't he a bigger star\\" Clive Owen. That should help, right? Apparently, no, not really. I found Killer Elite, which had a De Niro-mentored Statham, a special ops vet, squaring off against Owen's militant crime leader, to be utterly by-the-books and disposable. Expendable, even. While tI admit that I had a reasonably good time, I mostly felt the proceedings were all too familiar. If you don't mind a bit of \\"been there, done that\\" in your shoot-em-ups, feel free to give this one a spin.
1451627289|5.0|Rather than babble on about what the book is about, or give a history of Stephen King (really?), I would like to just thank the author for the gift that is a great book. Anyone who is an avid reader understands what I mean when I say that the sadder you are when you finish a book (because it's over), the better the experience was. And I was pretty sad when I shut this one. So it will go in the special glass case (alongside The Stand....the original printing, not the obese edition), reserved for the special ones....and I will say thank you Uncle Steve. I'm very glad that the particular string that has been my life has had your work in it.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Drive was one of the most polarizing mainstream films of 2011, and it's not hard to see why: advertised as a slam-bang action flick a la Fast Five, this moody, tense thriller combined the existential angst of 1970s road pictures with the sleek veneer of a movie from the 1980s. Ryan Gosling stars as a stuntman who moonlights as a criminal getaway driver. He develops a tentative relationship with a down-on-her-luck single mother, but in the process of protecting her from underworld forces, he too is caught in the crossfire. The result wowed me, I found it to be a genre movie of surprising depth and visual inventiveness; if you missed it in theaters, you should give the new Blu-ray/DVD/Ultraviolet set a chance, which comes with a bunch of making-of featurettes and an interview with director Nicolas Winding Refn.

B0067QPVJ6|1.0|They say 2011's The Thing was intended to be a prequel to the John Carpenter classic of the same name, but whether you call it a reboot, a remake, a retread, or a prequel, most agree on one thing: it was unnecessary. Rule of thumb: if you're going to invoke the name of a beloved classic and slap it on your film, it better be a damn good film, because comparisons to the original are inevitable. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the ostensible lead here, as a paleontologist who is brought to an Antarctic research station where a spacecraft has been discovered beneath the ice, complete with an extraterrestrial survivor. When the alien promptly escapes its icy prison and begins taking the form of the various researchers, jump scares and gore ensue. I found The Thing far inferior to the original, meeting only the bare minimum for a horror movie; you might could check it out if you're curious, but you're probably better off going with the original.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|The packaging was professional and sealed.  Unfortunately, the USB cord to power the transmitter is not correct.  One end is the normal USB that connects to the Xbox, but the other is a mini USB that would be for a cell phone or Blackberry.  The other end should be a round 5v plug to fit into the transmitter.  I paid for one day shipping only to receive a non-functional product.  Not impressed and will not order from seller again.
B005X7HA6C|4.0|Japanese auteur Takeshi Kitano made a name for himself with idiosyncratic crime dramas about the Yakuza, characterized by long static shots, creative editing, bursts of graphic violence, and deadpan humor. Though Kitano has since expanded his oeuvre to include comedies and art films, his latest export, Outrage, finds him returning to his roots, chronicling a Yakuza power struggle during a time of societal transition. After a handful of creative departures over the past decade, Kitano stated that he intended Outrage purely to be entertaining, and he succeeded. Screened in competition for the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2010, and it's already got a sequel slated for this year. If you're a fan of Kitano's work, particularly his mob films like Fireworks or Sonatine, chances are you'll probably enjoy this film.

B0068RHSCW|1.0|SPOILER ALERT  DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS  Jim Sheridan's made some great movies, and he's made a couple of stinkers. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of an all-star cast that includes Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and Naomi Watts, Dream House falls pretty squarely in the latter category. Craig stars as Peter Ward, a recently released mental patient and survivor of a brutal attack that left his wife and two daughters dead. Unfortunately, Peter is not altogether well, and he moves back into his decrepit home, believing in his mind that it is still the lovely home he left, and that his family is still alive and well... but with different names. As Peter's past and his fabricated fantasy come to a head, the truth is slowly revealed. Unfortunately, I saw the twists and turns coming a mile away, and in light of that, the film simply moved along at a snail's pace, too stuffy to be gripping, and too obvious to be scary. As it stands, it's the worst film I've seeb for Sheridan, Weisz, and Watts, and the second lowest for Craig.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is spectacular.  Its much cheaper than some (if not all) of the other desktop streamer apps available, and the customer service is so much better than I could have ever hoped for. This gets my seal of approval and the stars to match!
B006P0FD4W|2.0|The insanely successful horror series that is the Paranormal Activity franchise saw its third installment in as many years hit theaters last October, and after a dip in quality with the second film, Paranormal Activity 3 turned out to be a bit of an improvement. This time around, viewers are taken back to the beginning of the haunting central to the series, specifically the late '80s childhood experiences of sisters Katie and Kristi. Around the same time young Kristi begins having regular conversations with an \\"imaginary friend\\" named Toby, her mother Julie and Julie's boyrfriend Dennis begin experiencing unexplained phenomena in their house. As things steadily grow out of control, dark family secrets are revealed until, finally, all hell breaks loose. I found PA3 to be a modest improvement over its predecessor; though it's tough for any horror sequel not to run out of steam with each new installment, this one still manages to provide some suitably chilling moments. It's nothing you haven't seen before, but if you enjoyed the first two, you'll likely have a good time with this one, too.

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|A baseball movie that mostly eschews game sequences for scenes of guys sitting around and talking about obscure statistics -- sounds like a winner, right? Well, yes, in the case of Moneyball. Brad Pitt stars as Billy Beane, the general manager of the small market Oakland Athletics; his mission is to find a way to field a winning team with a fraction of the money that the Yankees and Red Sox have to snag big time players. With the help of stat geek Peter Brand, Beane acquires a ragtag group of castoffs and old timers who share a common trait: they have abilities that the entrenched scouting establishment has ignored. Based upon Michael Lewis' bestseller, Moneyball is an amazing film, and while baseball obsessives will find a couple things to quibble about -- the movie barely mentions the contributions of stars like Miguel Tejada, Tim Hudson, Barry Zito, or Eric Chavez -- this is an intelligent, witty piece of moviemaking. A new Blu-ray/DVD/UltraViolet combo pack comes with several making-of featurettes and bloopers.
0739385852|3.0|I would first like to say that I loved the prose. It reminded me very much of one of my favorite authors, Kate DiCamillo. I was drawn into the story and cared about the characters. The dialogue was well written and the story flowed. I thought about the book even when I wasn't reading it, which is always a good sign.  And then....the author began speaking through his characters about evolution. Maybe I'm too conservative and this just wasn't my cup of tea, but I heard the author more than the characters and felt like he was telling me what to think. The Skellig character was mysterious, I didn't need the characters telling me he was mysterious. And then Skellig told me he was mysterious and didn't know what he was. If you're going to leave it vague, just leave it vague. Don't tell the reader so blatantly. Alas, this ruined the story for me. I finished it because I was invested in the children characters and the prose was good. But I wish a good editor would have asked better questions somewhere along the way. Readers don't like to be spoon fed.  Still, I will try this author again. It is the rare work that is perfect.
B006DHAT5K|1.0|There was a moment -- albeit a very brief moment -- when it seemed like Anna Faris might have had the potential to join the elite ranks of successful comediennes in Hollywood. Unfortunately things haven't quite yet panned out for the bubbly Scary Movie alum, who's lately spent most of her time in bad films, including her latest, What's Your Number?. Here, Faris plays Ally Darling, a recently unemployed woman who comes to the realization she's slept with a lot more men than other women have. Hoping to put a cap on that number, Ally revisits her old boyfriends to see if any of them have grown into permanent relationship material. Co-starring Chris Evans, Joel McHale, Andy Samberg, and Zachary Quinto, What's Your Number? could have possibly been better with a stronger script and a better director; as it stands, while I found Faris sharp as ever, the film around her just is not that good.

B0062NAX1U|1.0|Independent Christian dramas have been the subject of some ridicule, primarily because they're often low budget affairs that wear their messages on their sleeves and feature sometimes questionable acting. Courageous manages at least to exhibit competent filmmaking, even if, as with previous films of its kind, it caters a little too heavily to a very specific demographic to be openly enjoyable for all. Set against the backdrop of the drug trade in Georgia, Courageous follows four deputies -- all fathers -- who are urged by their sheriff to spend more time with their families. When tragedy befalls one of the deputies, all four of them make a formal pact to change their lives and honor God in all that they do. My primary complaint had nothing to do with the message of the film itself; rather, I found Courageous to be a bit melodramatic and heavy-handed, choosing to gloss over complex issues with broad platitudes. If you're a believer, you may find yourself nodding in approval at the film, but don't expect Courageous to do much more than spoonfeed you what you already know it's going to say.
0312641893|4.0|A rather simplistic book, good for a younger reader.  I had some problems with some of the details, but then I grew up reading Asimov and Heinlein, so science details are important to me.  These would probably not bother a teenager.  I have donated it to our High School.
B004LWZW7E|1.0|Justin Timberlake has done a great job marketing himself as more than just a musical talent, and despite some of her recent film choices, it's almost impossible to dislike the typically charming Amanda Seyfried. However, the likability of In Time's two leads just wasn't enough to overcome the film's other problems. The story takes place in the distant future when adults stop aging at 25 but instead accrue time as currency. When factory worker Will Salas ends up with 116 years of time belonging to a dead man, he's accused of murder, and with a businessman's daughter in tow, he sets out to confront the system. Despite an intriguing premise and capable people both in front of and behind the camera, In Time suffers from all too blunt and heavy-handed storytelling. You'd probably be better off with director Andrew Niccol's similarly themed previous film, Gattaca.

B0069UP2PI|4.0|Steven Soderbergh is one busy man -- he's directed at least one film a year since 1995, with the exception of 2003 -- and he's also one of those directors who has successfully navigated both independent and mainstream waters with finesse. Last year, we got his latest ensemble hit, Contagion, an apocalyptic thriller about a deadly epidemic starring some of Hollywood's biggest stars, and while we've seen outbreak movies before, I found Contagion worthy of 4 stars. The story follows multiple threads as a lethal airborne virus rapidly goes worldwide, charting the paths of those tasked with mitigating the global impact of the disaster and those simply trying to cope with its deadly effects. Bolstered by an all-star cast that includes Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Laurence Fishburne, and Marion Cotillard, just to name a few, Contagion is a tense, tightly plotted, and exceptionally smart disaster movie that simply adds another notch to Steven Soderbergh's already stellar career.

B004A8ZWW4|3.0|The film that many dubbed Rock'em Sock'em Robots: The Movie initially surprised quite a few folks by being much better than a movie with that premise had any right to be. Set in 2020, when giant robots have overtaken the boxing circuit, Real Steel stars Hugh Jackman as Charlien Kenton, a former boxer-turned-robot trainer who is saddled with caring for his estranged young son Max when Max's mother dies. When the pair discover an obsolete sparring bot called Atom in a junkyard, they decide to rebuild him together, and an unlikely bond develops. I concede that the premise is silly, the dialogue a little cheesy, the plot -- like its mechanical protagonist -- a bit recycled, but if you're looking for a relatively straightforward underdog story with a smattering of father-son bonding, you could certainly do worse.

1451627289|5.0|\\"The past does not want to be changed\\"........This is the premise that drives 11-22-63, although this story is as much about nostalgia and the human experience as it is a very fresh and enjoyable take on time travel.<br /><br />Jake Epping a divorced 35 year old English teacher from 2011 is living a rather lonely life, as his ex wife has recently left him for someone she met in an AA meeting. Jake has few friends but he has befriended Al, the owner of a local diner who is able to sell his \\"real beef\\" burgers at suspiciously rock bottom prices. One day Al calls Jake to come over to the diner after hours to \\"show him something\\". Jake comes over only to find that Al who was healthy the day before, is in the last few days of terminal lung cancer and seems to have aged overnight. With little explanation as to his current state of health, Al decides showing Jake his secret is easier than telling him, and so Jake steps into the pantry of the diner, and into 1958....<br />I will not go into any more plot details than this, because \\"living\\" them along with Jake is what makes this a great read. King explores the terrible and sometimes catastrophic repercussions of trying to change the future by altering the past, and in this novelization you experience right along with our protagonist Jake that trying to alter seemingly unalterable events, (that changed lives and shaped history) is like wading though jello pudding, and is resistant to change. We also observe the horrors and ripple effects that these alterations bring about, the past, shall we say, will have it's day. At the end this novel asks the question; Was the past better left untouched? Even if you can prevent horrific events, was the world still a better place than the skewed reality created by changing them?<br /><br />Jake himself grows as a character, and in his five year journey he finds inner strengths that were deeply buried in the meek English teacher from 2011, and he even dares to love again. 11-22-63 also explores great questions of morality; selfish desires versus noble intentions, and whether the life of a friend or loved one is a sacrifice worth making for the life of a world leader.<br /><br />For me this was truly a page turner, and although a lot of parts of the book were a bit of a meander through the past, I never felt that it dragged because I experienced  life during 1958-1963 as if I had lived back then myself, so clear is the complete immersive experience that King gives us, the visuals... the smells...the sounds.... I also appreciated that King pulled no punches; as much as a beautiful sense of nostalgia that this novel gives you, you also experience the mindset of the day; A different restroom for those of another color, fear of communism, women truly being the lesser sex in society... I came away with a greater appreciation of both the past and the present. Of course like any King novel there is a little touch of the other-worldly going on here that we discover at the very end ;)<br /><br />Like any good book I was on a race to the finish, hoping I would never find it.morality; selfish desires versus noble intentions, and whether the life of a friend or loved one is a sacrifice worth making for the life of a world leader.

0763650420|5.0|Owl Babies absolutely has to be AppleBlossom's current favorite book. We actually got our hands on it a while ago and have loved it since day one and some how I skipped over giving it a review, but I really shouldn't have because it is a great story. Right now at two and a half years old she is mimicking the story and will \\"read it\\" herself. Bill is her favorite, and she is always telling me, \\"It's okay, Mama will come back.\\" Our children are so precious and learning everyday and having another book to provide reassurance that No Matter What, it will be okay and you'll never Guess How Much I Love You and Bunny My Honey, I love you. These are necessary. It is a wonderful message that needs to be told.<br /><br />Then to add on to this great story, with neat illustrations an animated storybook DVD. Sometimes mama wants a break from telling the story, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be told... Yesterday, AppleBlossom watched it 12 times in succession and wanted to go again! We are definitely a book first family, and TV later if at all, but this is a DVD I definitely do not mind popping in.<br /><br />I really enjoyed being able to watch the segment on Master Storyteller Martin Waddell and finding out when and where he got the idea to write the story. It is one of those things where you can really hear the voices of Sarah, Percy and Bill come off the pages (even before the animation!). The only thing, is that I definitely cannot leave the DVD in the book cover and it will have to find a new home (or case) to stay in, but I find that is true about lots of books that come with CDs or accompanying DVDs and thus doesn't bother me much.<br /><br />Also, my edition is paperback and has already gotten almost too much love. I think it would definitely be wise for us to invest into a hardcover or even the board book. It will be read! I've seen there are even gift sets that include stuffed animals! How cute! We love our book, DVD and stickers and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this for gifts for that special toddler or young child in your life.cial toddler or young child in your life.

0064430227|5.0|My adult son had been talking about his memories of this book during the year. We gave it to him as part of his Christmas gift and he lit up. He planned to read it to his wife so they could both enjoy the story again.
1451627289|3.0|I will admit up front that I'm not a fan of Stephen King.  It's not really him, it's the genre.  But the plot of this book fascinated me.  Being from that generation I thought the book would propose some closure to the Kennedy assasination.  I enjoyed the travels of the main character and all the characters in the book were well developed and interesting.  My problem is with the ending.  I agree with some other reviewers that we spent some 500 pages building up to the climax.  And then........well, not much.  Also the apocalyptic result didn't fit.  Possibly a different take on current culture would have been better.  It made me think King was setting this book up for a screenplay.  Certainly lots of special effects with the ending.  It was disappointing.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I am a teacher in the infant room at a child development center. I play this during nap time and both the infants and the adults in the room relax.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|iloveeitt.noquestionneeddedd.&lt;333download.itt this game totally rocks...definitely download It or you will be sorry.. hope you will take my.opinion and use it...thanks...well gotta goo...
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Once I get to a certain point in the game, it shuts down. I've tried rebooting my phone; still the same. Super frustrating. Needs an update
B004SBQGHS|1.0|do not get this game cause the free version is the exact same thing! trust me! I learner that the hard way!
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Pretty awesome blade.  Like most of the other reviews, this knife is hardy and will do most jobs.  It comes with a plastic sheath. The blade is real thick, durability isn't the issue here.  I say match this with a more finer blade knife, and you'll be set. Oh, and don't forget a blade sharpener too.
B002RV01QI|5.0|This is my \\"Get away from the World\\" CD and it works very well. I also play on my way to work to get relaxed.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Awesome and addictive. Play is good, the bar at the bottom is a bit touchy and gets in the way sometimes. But overall great.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|This movie is heartwarming, witty, and has great depth to the characters (something often missing in modern movies). The nature scenes and the shots of birds are really quite impressive. My family is full of birders, and I never really quite understood the \\"madness\\" that consumes them, but now I \\"get it.\\" This movie is wonderful for the birder AND the non-birder, and it will lift your spirits. I recommend that you not only buy it, but buy a few copies for friends. I would love to see more good movies like this one succeed.
B003UERZ88|2.0|I am going to be quick on these review, 11 bad to average songs, 3 good songs ( mower, hell razor and speed of sound) thats it¡
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Ordered this flash near the last minute, before Christmas. Got fast, free shipping. I didn't have any time to learn about the flash though. Put the flash on my D3100. Saw the little lever to lock the flash to the camera. Saw how to tilt the flash. Turned the flash and camera on, and began taking much improved photos. Love the bounce flash, so nice. There's a rule of thumb I believe in. The more power your flash has the better your your photos will be. Next step up in a Nikon speed flash, is the SB-900 or 910. But, they're bigger, heaver, and cost much more. Maybe my second flash will a SB-910 or maybe another SB-700. I really enjoy using this flash. It's very powerfull, will be ready for a second flash in a blink of an eye and can do the thinking for you while you learn. And it's a Nikon! What else would you want? I'm very pleased with my SB-700.
B000001EYW|5.0|I enjoyed this CD very much. The condition of the CD was excellent and the music is top notch. Every song from \\"Alone\\" to the cover song \\"Still Waters\\" is classic Bee Gees. Beautiful three part harmonies. My favorite song from this CD is \\"I Could Not Love You More\\". Great CD!
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Great movie and collector's edition is the must have to any fan of this movie. The collector's edition pack is also very beautifully crafted and it really feels as a collector's edition.
B004G600A4|5.0|I bought this for a friends daughter, and she along with her sister absolutely love the movie. Every time I'm over there they are watching it. Highly recommend for anyone with girls!
B003TXKSWK|4.0|...and it keeps getting better!  I was a little late to the party on this one. A friend of mine had it on recently and I was surprised its' release in 2010 escaped my notice. The first track I heard was the magnificent cover of Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes' \\"Wake Up, Everybody\\" and it struck me immediately. One interesting quip that other reviewers  have here is the song selection. I actually think this is where John and The Roots absolutely struck gold. Sure, they could have gone the more familiar route with \\"Mercy, Mercy Me\\", \\"What's Going On\\" and \\"Ball Of Confusion\\". Their masterstroke was going the other way with less recognizable selections in my opinion.  You can tell these guys love and respect this music. Some of the arrangements stick pretty close to the originals (\\"I Can't Write Left Handed\\", \\"Humanity\\") and some are rearranged (\\"Compared To What\\"). It's all done with taste though and this is a joy to listen to start to finish.  Highly Recommended!
B00632HWOG|2.0|I was disappointed in this app on several levels. Firsthand it is not Kindle Fire friendly and tends to freeze up a lot.  Secondly to not be able to easily force logon  from the installed device, I am not a big fan of open access to anyone that grabs a device.  The ten emails on a page and difficult navigation is another minus.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I don't like to get into great detail on reviews unless absolutely necessary. In this case it isn't necessary. This is easily the best thing he has done since New Skin for the Old Ceremony. Except for the great difference in his voice compared to then, many of these songs could be right at home on that album. Several traps will just grab you and haunt you just like many of his best.
B004GYY714|5.0|okay so I read all the reviews before I got this app and I told myself it would be ok but it turns out I LOVE IT! I listen to country music all the time and whenever I don't like 1 song I can just change the station its so cool!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I purchased this on my Kindle(first book!) and could not stop reading.  It is a very candid and personal look at the life of Steve Jobs.  It definitely changed my opinion on him, and Steve Wozniak.  Anyone who is a fan, and even those who are not, should read this.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is ok for passing the time but some games are difficult and I can't figure out where the instructions are.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|It's made well, I received it promptly and I really like it as it holds the Fire very securely. Classy!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I am so pleased with this product. It feels and looks so expensive and is so impressive. I have been told how great it looks. My Kindle fire fits perfect inside the holder. It folds so I can stand it up for easy reading.
0812992792|5.0|This novel's masterful craftsmanship and subject matter bring to mind a comparison with [[ASIN:0451228146 One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]. In Solzhenitsyn's much briefer novel, the point is that a single day in the Gulag is representative of Soviet life under Stalin. Examine a tree and you've seen the forest. In North Korea under Kim Jung Il (at least as Adam Johnson tells it here), the same is not true. It takes the story of a full lifetime to really see these characters in relation to their nation-state. You must survey the forest to understand the trees. (The specter and reality of labor camps also loom large in this novel.)<br /><br />Early in the novel, Pak Jun Do trains for zero-light hand-to-hand combat, which the government deems necessary for preparing to resist underground attacks from South Korea. Regarding how he adjusted to the complete lack of light in the tunnels, he reflects, \\"The darkness inside your head is something your imagination fills with stories that have nothing to do with the real darkness around you.\\" So it is with the North Korea of this novel--citizens here are kept in perpetual darkness, and unlikely stories become plausible and accepted. This book is a testament to the human spirit, in that it is the story of how a man trains himself to keep such stories out of his head, understand the darkness for what it is, and learn to fight for dignity within that darkness.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|Unbelievable quality in this movie!! This is one of my favorite all time movies and I played a starring role in the musical \\"Grease\\" when I was in high school. \\"Grease\\" on Blu-ray is worth EVERY PENNY. There is so much that cannot be seen on the DVD. Also, the extras from the \\"Grease\\" reunion party is amazing! I would recommend this to any \\"Grease\\" fan!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Really beautiful, really fun. Love the challenge! This game is a must and for .99 you can't beat it! Both of my kids enjoy this game too.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover is wonderful. It is lightweight so doesn't add unnecessary bulk to the Kindle itself.  The feature to prop up the Kindle at various levels is also handy.  The elastic strap is easy and secure still not getting in the way.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Happy with this product, slim, light, and does the job of protecting my Kindle.  Only thing negative is there is a thin matt finish that is wearing off the corners and leaving a shiney finish. Not too noticible.  I purchased it in white.. sharp looking cover.
B003Y5HWK4|3.0|The Blu-Ray versions of this set are defective (as verified by numerous reports from others here).  Freezing on some discs (beginning of Disc 2 on my set). Some discs don't even have menus from which to select episodes! (Disc 3 on mine. And I haven't even tried Disc 4 to see what problems may lie there.)  Those who have been sent replacements report the same problems.  It would seem that the entire run of the BD editions are affected.  This set needs to be recalled and re-issued with the problems rectified.
B006GH6IWU|3.0|I bought this hoping for some of the vintage concert footage. Unfortunately, the clips from the 70's are only a few seconds at a time. Though an interesting documentary, there are no full length live songs played on this video,  just very short clips. I want Queen to release the entire concert (or however much is recorded) of some of the great 3 second clips that are on this video such as the '77 concert at Madison Sq Garden. Brain...i  would pay a lot of $ for them:)
B005IEGUDY|5.0|I do not rate many books a five, but I could not find fault with this amazing book.  The historical content is unsurpassed.  The fiction is a condiment to the nonfiction in a way that brings England to life and keeps it living and breathing with excitement.  Very highly recommended for readers of real historical fiction.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|hard to stop playing! some of the games in particular are hard to beat which is frustrating but also fun and addicting at the same time. the rewards for participating and beating games are great motivators too!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's good to have various translations. The reading plan is also a great feature. I like the fact that I can use it on my Kindle Fire.
B0009HAHD4|5.0|It's officially made for the D50/70, but I would highly suggest this if you have a Nikon D40 or any other body with the same viewfinder type / bracket.  Unlike the little rubber piece that easily falls off that comes with the D40, this eyepiece actually attaches securely to the camera and does not have a risk of disappearing on you in the middle of a vacation :)  Happy shooting~
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Today's upgrade has appeared to correct the annoying crash prob which plagued this game. After I played several games on the Kindle Fire, no crash prob is apparent! Let's hope this keeps up! As long as this crash prob is resolved, this is one of the best Mahjong apps available- great graphics, enjoyable background music, nice sound effects! Awesome game--now!
0316069884|4.0|The impetus for Jonathan Safran Foer's Eating Animals, a monograph that details his reasoning for not eating animals, was the birth of his first child.  Foer wanted to be very sure that meat eating was as wrong as he thought it was, before he raised his son as vegetarian.  Eventually, Foer had amassed so much information on the topic, that he felt compelled to share it with others in the form of a book.  Foer's central thesis is that the divide between animals we eat, and animals that we do not eat, is arbitrary; meat-eating leads to extreme environmental degradation; and, most importantly, causes extreme suffering of almost every animal raised for food.   Prior to discussing the findings of his research, Foer briefly discusses the arbitrary divide between animals we eat, and animals that we do not.  For instance, Foer argues that there is no material reason why eating pigs, is any more justified than eating dogs.  In terms of intelligence and temperament, dogs differ very little from pigs and many others animals that American society deems appropriate for human consumption.  The reason, according to Foer, is that dogs have become companions, while other animals, such as pigs, cows, and chickens have not.  Foer puts it this way, \\"We care most about what's close to us, and have a remarkably easy time forgetting everything else.\\"  This arbitrary divide is found across cultures and there little uniformity to the animals that are considered friends or food.  Some cultures that eat dogs do not eat chickens, and some cultures that eat chickens do not eat dogs.   At this point in the text, Foer begins examining the devastating environmental effects of the twentieth-century innovation, known as factory farming.  Essentially, this method of farming is intended to maximize profits and meat production, while seriously decreasing overhead.  This accomplished by genetic manipulation, restricting mobility, and dramatic overcrowding of animals in indoor facilities.  While there issome variation in factory farming depending on the animal concerned, these facilities wreak unmitigated havoc on the environment.  The United Nation has even found that \\"farmed animals contribute more to climate change than transport.\\"  So, to put this in perspective, farmed animals contribute more to global warming than all of the cars, ships, trucks, airplanes, motorcycles, and tractors in the entire world.  Unfortunatley, the ozone is not the only thing polluted by factory farms.  For instance, the excrement produced by factory farms in the United States, which is estimated to be 130 times more than the human population produces, is dumped directly into open pits.  Over time, this waste leaks into nearby rivers, lakes, and oceans, and has been linked to numerous health problems in humans, including asthma, \\"persistent nosebleeds, earaches, chronic diarrhea, and burning lungs.\\"  Most surprisingly, considering that many so-called vegetarians eat fish, commercial fishing might even be more environmentally unfriendly.  Foer writes, for every pound of shrimp \\"26 pounds of other sea animals [are] killed and tossed back into the ocean.\\"   Most importantly, the animals that are used for food in the United States, whether they be pigs, cows, sheep, or fish, suffer horribly.  In one extreme case, investigators recorded slaughterhouse employees \\"administering daily beatings, bludgeoning pregnant sows with a wrench, and ramming an iron pole a foot deep into a mother pigs' rectums and vaginas.\\"  While this might be an extreme case, the regularly accepted treatment of food animals is not much better.  Chickens used for meat, known as \\"broilers,\\" are kept in \\"battery cages,\\" which wire cages \\"stacked between three and nine tiers high,\\" where each individual animals gets less than a square foot of space to move.  Chickens used for laying eggs, known as \\"layer chickens,\\" do not fair much better.  In fact, since male do not lay eggs they are destroyed by \\"being sucked through a series of pipes onto an electrified plate,\\" \\"tossed into large plastic containers\\" to starve or be suffocated, or \\"sent fully conscious through macerators,\\" which Foer likens to wood chippers.  Factory farmed cows, sheep, and fish suffer similarly.   Throughout this text, Foer persuasively supports his central thesis.  After even a quick review of the facts, the line between animals that we eat and do not eat, seems entirely arbitrary.  Even worse, due to the advent of factory farming, the environment is rapidly being destroyed and the suffering of animals is increasing to unparalleled levels.  What is yet to be seen, is how humans will deal with this dilemma during the twenty-first century.  Hopefully, works like Eating Animals will convince humankind that detriments of eating meat, far outweigh the benefits.  Bibliography  Foer, Jonathan Safran. Eating Animals. New York: Little, Brown and Co, 2009.
B003O86FMW|4.0|As indicated at the end of the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta may have survived, but the Capital is not pleased with the public rebellion of the berry stunt.  They may be publically hailed as heroes, but they have ignited a spark dissent among the districts.  As a result, they are now in even more danger and so is everyone that they know and love.<br /><br />Catching Fire is even darker than the Hunger Games.  Dark is good.  I like dark.  Yet, I am torn on how I feel about this book.  On one hand, it was a great, consuming read.  I could not put it down.  However, it felt a bit like the ending was rushed to get to a stopping point, where the story would pick up again in the next book.  I feel cheated.<br /><br />I am going to continue on to the next book, since there are just three in series.  (Oh please let there be just three.)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its not a bad game. I just wish that the games were longer and that we didn't need points to unlock new games. overall though,  its not that bad!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have purchased other bible apps before, and they are pretty basic. I was honestly surprised how AWESOME this was. I very easily selected my reading plan, get daily reminders to read, and I enjoy the audio option when needed. The earning badges is cool too. I love that there are so many different plans to choose from depending on what you are looking to learn. I am currently doing the 90 days, but am looking forward to doing many other plans. Thanks for this app!!!
B006WQLH7G|1.0|all it does is scan then says there are problems then just scans again and shuts offal it is a rip off
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I consider myself a Jane Austen purist, but was completely taken by this adaption of \\"Persuasion\\". Although I acknowledge the deviations from the book, I think there is something more important here...it gets to the heart of what Anne was feeling. The 1995 version may have been more accurate scene by scene, but I didn't feel a connection to the actors the way I do here. The feeling I get is the same I get reading the book...deep sympathy for the pain and regret Anne is experiencing, and a desire to see her get the happy ending she deserves. You can feel the tension is every scene that Anne & Wentworth are in together...that estrangement seems real and heart wrenching. Definitely one you'll want to keep the tissues handy for!
B000AXSN5G|5.0|This is some of Neil Young's finest work.  It is truly an inspired offering.  I have found it to be outstanding from the first to the last and I rarely listen to it in any fashion other than in its entirety.  This has gradually grown to become one of my favorite albums of the last 10 years.  Whenever I put it down I find myself coming back to it and always thinking that it is better than I remember it.  The album has a remarkable continuity or \\"album arc\\" that weaves its way through each track.  These songs are good individually, but outstanding as a package deal.  There are many common themes expressed in many different ways.  You get a glimpse into Neil's mind during a tough period for him (and the associated ups and downs that go with it).  These emotions and memories are extremely relateable and the way they are expressed feels immediately familiar.  Thanks Neil!  I'll keep enjoying this album for decades to come.
030788743X|5.0|I don't have anything to add that hasn't been said in the other reviews, so I'll just say yes, yes and double yes to all the good reviews. TONS of fun!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Mr. King is back in top form. I've been reading his work since the 70s and his writing seemed to undergo a dramatic decline in past years. However, I really enjoyed 11/22/63. I was afraid he would pull out a talisman at the last minute to fix everything but he seems to be over that.<br /><br />I hope this is only the start of a new phase in his writing career.
B001E45XT4|1.0|I purchased these for use in our office with skype calls. I thought that because they were gaming headsets that the mic quality would be excellent. It's not. You sound as if you are far away, in a large room. Other sounds in the room are picked up equally, without any depth of distance, so that, to the person on the other end, it is difficult to distinguish the voice speaking into the mic from any background noise.  To add insult to injury, on one headset the audio in one ear is completely broken, and on another headset, the mic chord literally just fell out. Both headsets are completely useless now! I could be more disappointed with my purchase.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|For a free games app, its not bad.  some games are kinda lame but others are entertaining. the adds are a pain for sure.
B006ZDS7CE|2.0|I gave this a try, wanting to give her the benefit of the doubt after SNL, but I find the kindest thing I can say is she's a more melodious Ke$sha. Just too soon for her to go for the gusto and she needs to quit singing in an affected way, just stay to pure vocals such as on Video Games, at least most of the song. She also needs some help lyrically for they are sadly shallow and inane...I see you on your Harley, looking pretty gnarly, riding through the stop sign, honey, go play your video game...I say dat you da bestest, lean in for a big kiss, put his favorite perfume on, go play your video game. One of those lines is a real lyric and one isn't.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love the fact that it has the Bible in different languages and versions and also it has amazing devotionals!
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Oh, this is the best.  Love the dark lyrics and the dark voice.  I did't discover Leonard Cohen until I was well into my 60's but have been madly in love ever since ... and this is just so Leolard, so soulful.
0525478817|5.0|This is a well written story about young smart witty people struggling with life's biggest adversary. I thought the author wrote the characters precisely as they would likely be if alive and in the cancer situation. He delved into emotions that see on target for grief, suffering, hopelessness and hope and love. He writes young people so well and with such intelligence and humor, that I wish I was more like his young characters when I was their age. Ultimately this story is about love and courage, and the hand life may deal you. I thought it was well portrayed and loved reading this book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this because it has so many games, but the unlocking system is strenuous... I do recommend this game, it's fairly brilliant.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this app has many reading plan options and helps spur you on.  a great encouragement to stay on course.  many different versions to choose from.  read offline too.
0307593312|4.0|Osh, this is a good book.  [[ASIN:0307593312 1Q84]]  So even though, it's not too lengthy that you cannot put it down the first few runs.  It is easy with bite-sized chapters that make you want to keep following the plot.  Easy, and with much gusto!
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|\\"Drive\\" is a movie that mixes classic film noir with modern-day action and drama movies. The main character is known only as the Driver, and Ryan Gosling gives a great performance as the man who falls in love with Carey Mulligan's character, and tries to help her better her life. The soundtrack complements the action on screen. The best part of the film is Albert Brooks, who was robbed of an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a brutal Mob boss who crosses with the Driver. Brooks gives the performance of his life and it's a shame that he wasn't given more honors for this film.  \\"Drive\\" starts out as drama, and finishes as a bloody, stylish action film. It's definitely worth watching if you like action movies, or good acting on screen.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|After reading so many complaints and negative reviews about this Apple Camera Kit I was real hesitant about ordering it. I am glad I did cause it works perfectly with my new iPad 2. Only thing negative I see so far with the kit is after you down load your pictures onto the iPad there is no way to edit them or name/rename the photo album that they're in. Hopefully Apple will fix that on a future update, but I'm not holding my breath.  If a person just wants their new pictures on their iPad to randomly look at, this appears to do that. Otherwise you'll have to transfer your edited photo albums via Apple iTunes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My Bible is always handy. I love the reading plans. My goal is to read the ENTIRE Bible this year.
0375851569|5.0|A classic book set at a great price.I was happy with the Product,the delivery & the Price.For those who want quality & quantity,this set is a great choice.
0307719774|4.0|I bought this book for my fiance as a birthday present last year -- and it has been a great conversation starter.  The great thing is that you do not have to use it every day...though that is the purpose.  Instead, you can write ideas for various days as your schedule allows.  Now we have purchased it for his sister who really loves remembering details of specific days, where she was, etc.  This book is a great way to log/track how you were thinking or what was important to you over the years.  We would recommend it for anyone who isn't into journals, but likes to track personal thoughts and ideas.
0385344228|4.0|IMHO the real evil person in this book is, undoubtly, Andy. In fact his ambivalence to everything, even after what happens in the end, makes the reader to want to cheer for Lougidice, the antagonist.  Andy is trying to defend Laurie in the end. To what reason? Why? Even the grand jury, who usually don't like to convict women from a certain background, is completely convinced of her guilt.  It seems Andy's sin is greater than those of his family members combined, by always try to do the wrong thing for 'the sake of family'.  The time is set 4 years ago, probably because it is not the trial of the person named in the book.
B003CN4R74|4.0|I love Amy Lee! Her voice has always given me a little jolt when I needed it. However I'm not going to say that this is her worst work in the world, but the way her songs sound now a days just aren't the same that they used to be. And just to clearify why, the whole band broke up and the drummer, the guitarist, and the rest of them went on to be with a new lead singer, they are now calling themselves, \\"We Are the Fallen.\\" Amy Lee went on to be in another band. I forgot what their names were. But now they're calling themselves Evanescence.<br /><br />  So if you're not into the whole hard rock thing, I wouldn't suggest buying it. Their not extremely hard core but, their style has certainly changed. But she still has a beautiful voice. However the music overpowers her voice in this CD. But I've been listening to it every night for the past... well since the week before christmas. It's been a long time since I've heard new music that actually sounds good. But most of their CD's are truely works of art. And, well, let's just put it this way; if you like bands like Lacuna Coil, or Plum, you'll definately like this CD. Not to say their a christian band like Plum, but their music style is still the same and they don't curse... well, at least not in this CD.<br /><br />  All in all, they are a wonderful band and this is a good CD, but the sort of vocally detatched sound makes Amy Lee seem overpowered within the song.
015206057X|5.0|Lovely book for my grandchildren and me to enjoy together. They love it and I love it! Arrived on time in new condition.
B006OT03BM|5.0|Amazing purchase, truly a collectors item and definitely worth it. The price will definitely shoot up so, if you want one, get it now before you regret it ! Also, bare in mind, that all 3 movies would cost you more or about the same if bought separately, so, happy shopping !
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app loaded correctly and was easily configured for my location. AccuWeather for Aneroid provides more information than the Weather Channel app. Nice radar too.

0062082353|4.0|On the surface, some may see Kyle's book as a great war story--it is that. But a deeper read of the book shows this to be a highly personalized account of the evolution of a man over the back-drop of war.  Overlayed onto the story of Mr. Kyle's war time experiences is the story of Chris's evolution as a man, as a soldier, but most of all as a father and husband. Woven in throughout the book is story of his courtship and marriage to Taya, and to their starting a family. The book shows the not so pleasant realities of the difficulty imposed on our military families by fathers and husbands answering the call of duty. I admire Kyle's candor about his putting country (and the SEALs) ahead of his family. Some authors would not be so willing to display their personal pocks like this.  I was afraid the story of his marital relationship and its difficulties would take away from the narrative, but far from doing so it enriched it especially with the commentary written by his wife which added dimension to the personal drama of Kyle's 4 deployments. One has to appreciate a man whose patriotism and sense of duty called him away from home and family so many times. Some might condemn his priorities. But without such men, who would fight our battles?  As mentioned, the book shows Mr. Kyle's evolution away from a priority list of God, country and family and turning it into the more correct sequence of God, family country. At the end of 4 long, eventful deployments, Mr. Kyle clearly came to realize what's most important in life and that a man should only be asked to sacrifice so much for his nation--and that his family needed him more than the war did. You have to give Chris credit for this awakening. Not that what he did in taking 4 deployments was wrong--far from it--I believe he was doing what God intended for his life. But he did the right thing leaving the military when he did. Clearly it was time.  The events he was involved in during the Iraq War are of course the main focus of the book and for me the most engrossing. Chris is a great story teller and the battles he fought are well drawn and really pull you in. The Fallujah chapters were particularly interesting. I felt like I was there in the thick of the battle with Chris and his team. The story of the 2400 yard kill he made near the end of his final deployment was truly amazing. Mr. Kyle's wicked sense of humor also shines through the narrative as well. This is anything but a dry read.  Not as big a page turner as his buddy Marcus Lutrell's book \\"Lone Survivor,\\" \\"American Sniper\\" nonetheless deserves its own honored place in the realms of recent war literature. While \\"Lone Survivor's\\" chapters on Seal training I felt were stronger, Kyle's book nonethless does a nice job describing this grueling process. This book is certainly more personal than Lutrell's book, and I think I came away with a better sense of who Chris Kyle is than I did from Lutrell and his book.  My only quibbles with the book are I wish he had used less profanity. I know that's how soldiers talk and I don't want to rob the book of Chris's personality (which comes out abundantly in the volume). I just thought it was a bit excessive.  I would have been interested too in having more dates to the events described to give us a better idea of the time line of Chris's tale. I think the book could have used a little more disciplined editing too, eliminating some of the one and two sentence paragraphs and the sections describing the guns Chris used which didn't really interest me not being much of a gun guy. But I'm sure this will be of great interest to gun enthusiasts. I just thought that aspect could have been blended into the war stories. Despite that, the book is well-paced and never bogs down at any point other than perhaps the gun section, but even then just barely. But these are minor critiques.  To the left wing scolds reviewing the book on here who want to dismiss Chris as a \\"warmonger,\\" stop playing so predictably to type with your tiresome self-righteousness. I have my doubts you even read the book. Chris isn't some blood thirsty fiend. He was a man who had a job to do and did it well and took justifiable pride in it--even if you don't understand that or agree with the Iraq War. He truly felt what he was doing made the world a better, safer place. Instead of simpering over people who'd gladly kill you and your family merely for being an American try thinking of the lives he saved, both American and Iraqi, by taking out the terrorist beasts who wanted to use Iraq to impose their nihilistic, oppressive and monsterous perversion of Islam on Iraq and the region. Who are those of you who never served and were never in Iraq to question Chris's motives?  Overall a book that will draw you in and hold you. Well told, unafraid, candid, honest, unvarnished. Admirable traits for a war biography in such PC times as ours that discourage the idea of there being any glory to be had in war. Mr. Kyle does a competent job putting the lid on that sentiment. Thank you Mr. Kyle for all you did for me and for all you did for all of us.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|The LDR persona on this album is a woman trapped in her own femininity. She is in love with a guy who is, at best, indifferent to her.  In the single \\"Video Games\\", she does whatever she can to get his attention, but he just wants to play games.  When she sings \\"the road is long ... try to have fun in the meantime\\" on \\"Born to Die\\" she sounds so emotionally dead that the listener knows right away that no fun will be had. When she sings \\"It's all gonna happen\\" on \\"This is What It Makes Us Girls\\" we know that NOTHING is going to happen.  The closest comparison I can think of to the protagonist of this disc is Betty Draper in \\"Mad Men\\"--someone who has everything yet has nothing.  Yes, the album is slickly produced and it's not perfect, and I would even say it's more in \\"pop\\" territory than \\"alternative\\" but there's something just off-kilter and scary enough about LDR to make this an intriguing debut and leave me wanting more.

B005DKLPQ0|5.0|Perfect remastering and artwork reproduction. Everything you could possibly want is here (except, sadly, \\"Jeanne\\" for some reason).  The Smiths were one of my favorite bands of the 80's and listening to them today I see that most of the music has held up. Also, Morrissey showed much more humor here than in his solo work.

B004EPYZT4|3.0|Born on the battlefield to his dying mother, the young Conan (Leo Howard) is a fierce warrior even as a boy. Yet, his father Corin (Ron Perlman) believes his son is too violent and not prepared to wield a proper sword. When their village is attacked by the evil Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang), Conan is left as the only survivor. Zym is intent on using the mystical Mask of Acheron to resurrect his dead wife and rule all of Hyborea as a demi-god. Years later, the adult Conan (Jason Momoa) has traveled around the world and had many adventures, yet he still hasn't found the men responsible for his father's death and the destruction of his village. A chance encounter with a master thief called Ela-Shan (Said Taghmaoui) leads Conan to a trail that will bring him face to face with those responsible for his father's death. Along the way he meets a female monk named Tamara (Rachel Nicholas) and rescues her from Zym's invading army. She falls in love with Conan and Conan, well, he's just too much of a man for one woman. Zym needs Tamara's blood because she's the last of a line of pureblood's responsible for the original destruction of the Mask of Acheron. It's a game of cat and mouse with the possible fate of all of Hyborea on the line.<br /><br />I had been looking forward to watching CONAN THE BARBARIAN. It has been years since I saw the 1982 version with Arnold Schwarzenegger, so when I saw the previews for this version, I thought it would be a decent reboot. The movie has some great visual effects and set designs and the cinematography isn't bad. You really get the sense that this is the world of Hyborea that Robert E. Howard wrote about and not just some desert. The visuals are the best thing about the movie.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is flat. There's just no life to the characters. Jason Momoa tries, but he's really not given much terms of dialogue. Schwarzenegger didn't have a ton to say in the 1982 movie, but I think he had better dialogue than Momoa's Conan does. Not only that, but Arnold's Conan had a ton more personality than Momoa's version. Stephen Lang has the best role as the villain Zym. In fact, he's about the only character in the whole movie that has any life to him whatsoever. There's lots of blood and some nudity, but it doesn't mean anything because the story is so lackluster and the characters are so lifeless.<br /><br />The movie isn't a complete waste, but it could have been so much more. In short, if you are a fan of Howard's novels or the character of Conan, you will probably want to watch the movie. Action fans will probably be split on whether they like it or not. Though I didn't think it was terrible, I actually prefer the 1982 version.Not only that, but Arnold's Conan had a ton more personality than Momoa's version.

B0054JZC6E|2.0|It is fun to unlock games, but it requires too many points and the games are kind of lame.  I have not found a game that I really enjoy.  I would not suggest this game to anyone unless they have a lot of time to kill.
B000FVNX2Q|2.0|For the CFA exam, this is kind of a joke since it will return incorrect results for some of the basic calcs that involve fractional periods. You end up getting the TI BA anyway, so you might as well buy that now for $20 less. Also, there is no support for parentheses, so chained calcs are annoying to do.
B001JNNE64|2.0|This is one of the best movies ever made, full stop. I really wouldn't know where to begin in praising it. The terrible shame is that it is only available in Blu Ray in a director's cut. Many years ago I happened to find the theatrical release in DVD in the US (I live in Oz) and happily turfed out the director's cut. I would never buy the director's cut again no matter how magnificant the Blu Ray quality. The reason is because just about every inserted scene is vile. It changes the whole tone of the movie. When you watch the director's cut you come to appreciate how essential editing can be. The best example is in the greatest scene in any movie to depict genius. It is the moment when Madame Mozart comes up to Salieri without her husband's permission and with his original manuscripts, to apply for a teaching position. Salieri looks at the manuscripts and sees they are completely perfect - not the slightest correction in evidence. They are the first and only draft. It is as if Mozart received dictation from heaven. In marvel Salieri looks at them one after the other as we hear snatches of the brilliant music, and then he drops them through his fingers; he tramps on them as he turns away and says he can't help. The scene is completely convincing. This marvelous moment somehow is chopped into several bits in the director's cut and a whole day of activity is inserted; not only that, but the day involves him forcing his way onto Mme Mozart. The dramatic impact and focus on Mozart's extraordinary brilliance is completely lost. It's disgusting and unnecessary. Just about every aspect added into the director's cut is puerile in this way.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Liked the lost father story line, semi-futuristic setting, the Rocky-esque underdog, and even the love story that thankfully wasn't a large part of the movie.  Oh yea, and robots!  What's not to like.  A feel-good fun ride, that had me cheering and hollering.  Very enjoyable!
B000V5ZIBU|5.0|Star Trek was and has always been a utopic vision of the future. Humanity has stopped warring with each other and has created a Federation in the skies where they war with other humanoid lifeforms before ultimately converting them to the ways of peace and prosperity. Nothing wrong with a good utopia, but humanity has never been good at creating or maintaining them - thus the need for fighting with other humanoids.<br /><br />Deep Space Nine specifically addresses this conundrum. When Captain Sisko arrives at the edge of civilized space to take command of the space station Deep Space Nine he discovers chaos. The station itself is a mess and barely operating. Sisko is still grieving for his wife, killed when Captain Picard became a Borg, and Sisko's teenage son, Jake, is resentful that he has been brought to a place that doesn't even have a bed for him. The Beljoran people who are co-managers of Deep Space Nine are recovering from decades of occupation by the Cardassians and have an unstable provisional government, represented by a thorny second in command, major Kira. This isn't the bright colors and peaceful planets of the original Star Trek or TNG and because of that is much more compelling.<br /><br />In wonderful metatextual asides the flaws of the original series and its utopian vision are specifically addressed by the characters themselves. Humanity has a history of barbarity and greed, even though as the Federation they now tell other peoples how to live. Conflict is inevitable. First seasons of long-running shows are generally the weakest of the lot, but even though Season One has to do all of the plot and character development that a first season does, it is never boring and holds up well, even though the show is almost twenty years old. All of the characters are intriguing and well fleshed and even the villains have redeeming moments and characteristics. I personally enjoyed seeing a different side of Picard and a different vision of Picard's time as a Borg and how all might not be as easily forgiven as it was from the point of view of Picard. Picard killed Sisko's wife and the hatred and shame between the two men is gristly and stunning to watch.<br /><br />I will be watching all seven seasons of DS9 and expect to enjoy them all, which was a pleasant surprise. Top flight television science fiction and recommended to fans of Babylon 5 and science fiction generally, NOT just fans of Star Trek. A much richer stew than the Star Trek franchise usually provides.ot be as easily forgiven as it was from the point of view of Picard.

B006SV2LWA|5.0|It's a quiet but intense movie showing the spread of a killer virus with what seems like realism. The infection spreads at a believable rate with consequences that are predictable but understated. The science aspect was fascinating as well as the bureaucratic maneuvering you'd expect in government agencies dealing with an epidemic. Mostly it is a study of how various people respond to the spread of the disease. Not the action/science fiction you might expect from the title, more of a science/drama taking place on the set of a PBS documentary. Great performances, amazing direction. And it was fun to see Demitri Martin in a serious role.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|Awesome... Why do I need to write a book report on this? I just want to rate it with starts! Anyway, good movie.
0920668372|5.0|I was truly taken by this wonderful story; similar to the \\"compulsive\\" nature of the characters in the story I cried relentlessly for weeks - at home, at a bris, in the grocery store, temple, work, family barbecues, etc. I guess I am a bit obsessive.    What touched me deeply was the mother's compulsive love for her child/man-child even rocking him at 150 lbs. As the story takes its course the son realizes his mother's love for him, and, as she becomes too feeble to care for him he reverses roles and cares for her.    With much sarcasm aside one of our one star readers called this book creepy. I guess when you think of it, it is a bit odd, however my mother and father needed my care and unconditional love in their declining years and what I gathered most from this book was the important message of true love- love forever.
B002VWNICW|4.0|I received the Blu-Ray version today and was totally unprepared for the audio track. The musical sound is exceptionable. The transfer is top notch. Clear and bright. I have owned other releases of this and this is by far the best one. All the actors are invested in their role. I especially like Kiera Knightly's efforts. Brenda Blethyn as nearly insufferable Mama. Donald Sutherland as long suffering Papa. Jena Malone's turn as the silly fifteen year old sister. When Elizabeth escapes to the, what should I call it, shelter near a lake during a rainstorm and Mr. Darcy follows her and they argue was a great scene. Judi Dench and Kiera's rapid fire repart&eacute;es are beautiful to behold. At the end when the view of Mr. Darcy's home across the lake was shown, there were swans swimming about. Was this a reference to Swan Lake? A suggestion that Elizabeth was a \\"swan\\" who needed love to become human? Well, who doesn't need that?  I doubt that I can improve on other's reviews so I won't try.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is actually better than I thought it would be. having to unlock the majority of the games keeps it challenging and fun.

B005AUWY90|3.0|Pixar changed the face of animation back in 1995 with \\"Toy Story\\" and the studio continues to do terrific films.  This isn't one of them.  Pixar's stock in trade has been to not only produce the best visual animation, but to have heartfelt storylines and enough inside humor to keep the adults interested.  In this sequel to the significantly better original, they get the visuals right.  In fact, I don't know if I've ever had a better picture on my plasma.  And the DTS-HD sound is perfect as well.  From a technical aspect this is reference quality stuff.<br /><br />Lightning (Owen Wilson) gets invited to a World Grand Prix which will take place in Japan, England and France.  It is sponsored by a company that has developed a new fuel that is expected to replace oil based gasoline.  Lightning reluctantly invites his best friend Mater the tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy) along.  A spy plot surfaces as nefarious losers cars (Pacers, Gremlins, Yugos) are bent on destroying the race cars with some type of laser beam.  They don't want fossil fuel to be supplanted.  British master counter spy Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and his cohort Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) mistake Mater as an American contact.<br /><br />Larry the Cable Guy has the most to do in this adventure and frankly a little goes a long way.  After a while, I could certainly understand Lightning's reluctance to bring him along.  Still as his best friend, Lightning shouldn't be upset when Mater screws up and embarrasses everyone.  In the end of course Mater saves the day.  Unlike most of the other Pixar films, I had no tears welling up in my eyes and don't remember laughing or snickering much either.  I saw this in 2-D and I suspect the 3-D is spectacular if unnecessary.  Most kids and some parents will likely have fun with the movie.
0446573019|2.0|First Baldacci book I have been disappointed in and that is no doubt due to my familiarity with what CID really is and what CID agents really are.  In 35 years as an agent I never saw or met or heard about anyone even remotely similar to Puller.  Where do I begin?  The story if replete with factual inaccuracies about CID and CID agents.  Accurate was location of the 701st, where the schools and lab are located and that is about it. Puller would never have been doing any investigation as a WO1 without a senior agent partner.  Agents do carry the M-11 but don't carry two.  No MP5 in the trunk, folks, sorry. We don't conduct investigations in uniform except in a combat theatre.  Generals don't get interviewed by WO1 agents and they don't talk to CID agents as portrayed in the story.<br />If Puller had the investigative track record touted by the 701st and a reliable reputation as an investigator he would not still be<br />a WO1.  The superhuman guy I read about would surely have been a CW3.  His combat record as an enlisted man does not translate to<br />skill as an agent.<br /><br />Generally speaking I found the dialogue grossly caricaturized and unrealistic. When I think of the quality of Wish You Well I keep thinking someone else wrote this for Mr. B.  And I can't believe he liked it!<br /><br />You cannot determine a .338 Lapua fired the .338 bullet from retrieving the bullet only, particularly one that travelled through two sides of a motorcycle helmet and a human skull.  You would need the spent case to do that unless you were clairvoyant... what about all the other .338 caliber cartridges?  A sight that clips on the M11?  I don't think so...<br /><br />I just hope Mr. Baldacci did not get this information from someone at CID Command because if so, someone played a terrible joke on him.<br />So many great sources for accurate (and interesting) information on this little known LE agency, I hope Mr. B accesses some if he does the screenplay or a sequel. There are retired agents (at least one) at Smith Mt Lake........

1933865415|5.0|I ordered the signed and numbered hardcover directly from the publisher and I was very pleased with the book.  It's an oversized hardcover with a slipcase (similar to DC's \\"Absolute\\" volumes).  The book is mostly nudes in Timm's signature style, but there is a good amount of variety.  DC girls Batgirl, Catwoman, Harley Quinn, Batwoman, Supergirl and Poison Ivy make sexy but PG-rated appearances.  There are also a few illustrations of the vampire women and monsters of Hammer films.  This is a thick tome with one piece to a page, so you'll definitely get your fill of Timm \\"good girl\\" art. Highly recommended!

0143117009|3.0|Not being a lawyer, but associated with Federal Law enforcement for 29 years, I have the following comments based on a professional experience with the subject, at least tangentially, and perhaps more importantly, with the reptition and irrelevant material which would have been tossed in a court of law. Repitition and irrelevance may  have their place in fiction, but do not add anything more to the subject than weight-not intellectual, but weight of the paper pulp used to print the book.  WDC may be able to pass all the laws the enviornmentalists want. I would not disagree with a subject that I do not have a professional or moral right. However, I do have a professional opinion worthy of respect, that NO law is worth a pot of .... is it can not be enforced.  Or if the law is so  poorly written, it can not possibly be enforced. Or usuing Prohibition as an example, a law with a dubious good intention that had horrible consquences.  Lastly, I would note that gathering evidence is not just the tool of the scientist, but also the tool of the investigator.  The \\"peer\\" review by members of the same class, do not compete with the combat in the courtroom. No opinions are allowed. No anedoctal evidence is given any weight. The world of academia does have its competitive adversarial battles, but before those battles for grants, recognition and economic rewards begin, they must first pass a gate established by academia itself. Not many BA candidates get very far if they do not toe the \\"correct\\" parameters to pass, get into prestigious schools, and have the correct connections to publish.  I would note that the authors lengthy book basically ignores the problem of law enforcement primarily by blaming past problems of previous owners no longer being legally repsonsible for their toxic wastes. As someone who actually lives in an agricultural area, and  has to deal with current attempts to clean the Chesapeake Bay runoff area, I have come into contact with a number of incompetent Federal and state employees.  Although I have do not have any degree in any enviornmental courses, I do have studied logic, and from my law enforcement experience, I can recognize a problem when alledged experts have conflicting views. When one governement department is satisfied, should anyone be surprised when some more violatle persons start bringing weapons into public hearings.  That's not good. As someone who has had to stand between two angry groups, some of whom were armed, I yearned for \\"common sense\\" I believe our ancestors must have had. We could atnot have become the great nation we are today, and the lack of that common sense seems to be leading us into the same illogical illusion created by those years of prohibition.

0452287022|5.0|This book had it all.  Mystery, description, characterization.  I loved it and was riveted.  Sense of place is very important to me and this book had beautiful descriptions of France.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Get your affairs settled, pets walked, food made, fave shows set up on DVR, because once you begin reading you will NOT want to stop, for anything.<br />I have heard mixed things about John's other books (Looking for Alaska & Paper Towns) so when presented with the opportunity to read this I have to admit I was NOT expecting such a phenomenal novel.<br />As with all new books I get, I skimmed a few pages, unlike the OTHER books I did NOT stop \\"skimming\\" until it was 430am!<br /><br />I wish I could emotionally detach & look at this book & review it constructively. This story will do everything to your emotions, BUT make them detached.<br /><br />Hazel & Augustus are teenagers, obviously destined to be lovers & best friends, and meant to die long before they normally should.<br />A cruel twist of fate drags them together. The Cancer Kids Support Group.<br /><br />Before you think this will be a dreary & sad book bout cancer & kids that die from it, please think again. While cancer is in their lives it has not taken them over. We are not bored to tears with medical lingo & incessant chatter of chemo & it's side effects.<br />A few medical conversations take place, but they add to the story not control it.<br /><br />As we live through their eyes & become immersed in their story we cheer for them. We know there will be no unrealistic \\"OMG THEY FOUND A CURE FOR THIS RARE CANCER\\" moments & I respect the author for not insulting our intelligence by even leading us to think it is possible.<br /><br />We want Hazel & Augustus & their friend Isaac to live the best life they can, while their health allows it.<br />We want to support them & be there for them. That's all we can realistically do.<br /><br />Isaac is a mutual friend, also from Cancer Kids Support Group. His story line adds depth to the overall story. He shows us how these kids act when a \\"cure\\" for cancer doesn't always mean a stereotypical happy ending & how sometimes sacrifices must be made to save a life.<br /><br />It's easy to see how friendships forged under these circumstances are so strong & true, as fleeting as they may be. They truly learn to take it one day at a time & to appreciate ALL life has to offer. From a sunrise to petting a kitten to playing a video game with your best friends.<br /><br />Hazel is taken on a vacation with Augustus that changes her life in so many ways it makes you dizzy with emotion.<br /><br />I was introduced to what seemed to be a strong supporting character & his role was chopped to hell. Peter Van Houten, the alcoholic author they went to Amsterdam to visit. His role confused me a bit. I understood where John Green went, at the end of the story, but Peter Van Houten could of been a stronger, stable, side character. He was such an integral part of the story & was kinda wishy washy when it came down to it.<br /><br />The other small gripe I had was that these young kids had \\"Dawson's Creek\\" syndrome. Sometimes they spoke a bit too mature for even bright 16 & 17 year old kids.<br /><br />Despite a few small \\"fly in the ointment\\" type annoyances this novel had me engrossed from beginning to end.<br /><br />Hazel & Augustus (Isaac's too) parents were simply awesome. They were what you would imagine a family in their position to be like. Staying strong together in front of their child & crying like helpless babies together behind closed doors, waking up & doing it all again. I liked that, I liked seeing they were human & felt the stress & helplessness & unfairness of it all. It was real. Too real.<br /><br />This novel will definitely invoke strong emotions in us all. We will rage at the cruelty of cancer yet be glad for every single moment of happiness Hazel, Gus, & Isaac have. Together & apart. Isaac was a supporting character but he really struck a chord with me. I keep mentioning him because IMHO he WAS the strongest of them all.<br />We think we know where each character will end up, but we don't. John Green has truly crafted a storythat will play itself out in your memory long after you close the book.<br />\\"The Fault in Our Stars starts with cancer & ends with life\\"

B0019N8P2W|5.0|There is no doubt that Daria was a series originally aimed at the young female teen market, so the near univeral praise and adoration that was heaped upon this show probably came as a bit of a surprise to the creators. A spin off of the Beavis and Butthead series it takes the butt of much of their distain and turns her into an amazingly deep character that embodies the epitome of American youthful ambivalence. The supporting cast of characters is richly developed, and unusually for a series like this, the adults get equal time in the stories. Another wonderful feature of this series is the fact that it actually has an end to it that is both heartwarming and thoughtful. In the end, this is not a series just for teen age girls. It is a universal form of entertainment with enough verite and humor to be appreciated by all sexes and all ages. Ahh, the kids in America.

B00729GQ0A|4.0|I've been waiting for awhile to read this book, having read an excerpt, and I wasn't disappointed. I was enchanted, seeing this new world through Sophia's eyes, and even though the book has vampires and I'm not much of vampire novel fan, the author integrates them so seamlessly into this world that it didn't feel like a typical vampire novel at all. It was fascinating to read about the elementals, what Sophia's curse had to do with this new world, and I like how pretty much everything interconnected. The relationship between Sophia and Charles was also very well done-- you could definitely feel the romance building between them, slow and sweet.  *** MILD SPOILER ALERT***  I'll admit that there were times when I was not fully able to understand why Charles and Sophia behaved in certain ways at certain times-- or rather that I was skeptical of their behavior. It was a bit aggravating for him to be so back and forth in the beginning regarding their relationship-- his desire to not get into a relationship directly in contrast with him climbing into her window at night, amongst other things. Sophia was obviously just as frustrated, so I suppose that was the point. But for a man who was supposedly centuries old, he seemed to act exactly the age that he looked. And when Sophia finds out about Ivory, I found myself skeptical that she didn't at least try to talk to her before she went straight into that ritual. They'd been friends for a very long time, and even though Ivory clearly has been holding back major secrets and Sophia was feeling betrayed, if it had been me I would have wanted to ask why before I went through with what Sophia did.  *** END SPOILER***  Overall, though, the book was great. The characters were fleshed out, and each scene and setting vividly brought to life. This author knows and understands the value of description, and is not afraid to use it-- yet she doesn't bog down the narrative with lengthy descriptions of people or places. It all flows very naturally. The pace is a tad slow, but the mystery of what exactly is going on definitely keeps you going. Nothing is what it seems in the beginning, I can definitely tell you that much!  If your cursor is hovering over the 'buy' button, I suggest you click it now! You won't regret buying this book. I didn't, and am eagerly awaiting the next book!

0307888681|4.0|So I pretty much didn't know anything about this going in, except that it was about Zombies and that there is a movie forthcoming. Oh, and apparently most of my Goodreads friends who have read it like it, but I didn't see that until after the fact, because I literally did not even look at the Goodreads page.  It seems most of the people who didn't like this book are hardcore Zombie fans, and this one is pretty low on the Braiinnsss count. Which, I for one, am very grateful. Because this is my second Zombie book, and if there were actual large amounts of zombies, I would have probably disliked it. And of course, being my second zombie book, I must immediately compare it to the only other Zombie Book I have read (unless I have read others that I am now forgetting, but this unlikely...), Feed. Superficially, both are very similar-- they are very media heavy, happen after the bulk of the Zombie Apocalypse, and sure a lot of people died, but we still have Technology! World War Z is far, far more successful at rising above (har har) its B Move Plot. Sure, Feed is fun and all, but its a B Movie at heart. World War Z is like its simmer, darker, more literary cousin.  That isn't to say I loved it, though. In fact, the amount of time that was devoted to War and Zombies was kind of too much. I liked the asides into the more normal experiences, and that the super gross, momentary lapses where civilization is loss is kind of on the side of things-- we still have our Joint Strike Fighters after all. My inner Marxist Historian is not dead either, and it liked parts of this book a lot too.  Minor complaint: Maybe I have just been reading too much large typed YA, but I read it in one sitting and my eyes are not pleased. The type seemed small. I just opened Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, and it is not that small. Like they figured their target audience wouldn't buy it if it was over 350 pages and made it small? All I know is I am going to have to watch Once Upon a Time before Iget back to my books. Not that I'm complaining.
B005Y423ZC|4.0|The singing and performance were outstanding as expected by the artist Adele. However, what was so disappointing was her \\"potty\\" mouth. I just don't think it is appropriate to drop the f%^# bombs. It is totally unnecessary and absolutely unlady like. Whatever happened to be being a lady?
0312641893|3.0|I waffled on reading this one for a bit, but I ended up really enjoying it. At first I was still concerned with the fact I learned more about Chinese culture from one quarter of Chinese than the author seemed to have encountered in her research, though I am willing to ignore that to an extent because of the whole \\"Earth goes Kaboom, here's the aftermath\\" side of things. Still would have liked proof she had actually Done the Research, but hey, its YA, can you even ask for that anymore?  Cinder strays far enough from its premise as a retelling to be engaging, but yet again, a YA novel hinges on the relationship between the protagonist and the male love interest. The world building had far more cohesion and stuff going on that in most pseudo science fictional YA settings, which again, was somewhat interesting.  I was also slightly disappointed with the fact that it is the first installment in a series, but again, its YA, what am I expecting? Overall, a quick, rather engaging read, even though my first reaction on finishing it was to pick up \\"The Diamond Age,\\" because I was curious what effect nearly 15 years would have on the kind of technology portrayed in a superficially similar world would be.  The answer? Not that much-- though Diamond Age actually bothers hypothesizing how such tech would work--radio antennas having to be a certain size! How quaint! But yes, Cinder is very clearly a lay person writing science fiction novel, which isn't necessarily a bad thing....except when you can directly compare it to one that, well, isn't. Still a fun read, but lacking

0812992792|5.0|This isn't a story, a narrative, a movie concept. It is a novel in the truest sense -- an examination of the human condition through what to most readers, including myself, is a bizarre but ultimately utterly believable mileu -- the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the near past, under Kim Jong Il.  I believe this should become a classic novel, a hope made possible by the timely demise of the real-life Kim Jong Il. had he lived to be overthrown by a military coup, or had gone through some kind of transformation like Qaddafi with his weapons programs, the \\"Kim Jong Il\\" of this story would be exposed as unreal. As it is, we'll never know, so this novel can live forever.  I do not know to what degree the author's depiction of the DPRK is accurate -- I certainly pray that it is an extraordinary exaggeration. But the author's skill is such that you can believe in it, exaggerated or not.  Imagine \\"1984\\", but not as mere speculation, but rather as current description -- made all the more believable through the portrayal of the clear ineptitude of the regime in so many respects other than in keeping its iron grip on power and on its people.  Read it. It will remain with you.

0307957934|4.0|First, DO NOT be put off by the fact that this chillingly plausible (despite what the NY Times says) novel takes place in the world of hedge funds and the financial market. Harris makes everything you need to know about these realms crystal clear in a simple and entertaining way.  Concentrate instead on the dazzling variations Harris works on \\"Frankenstein\\" and, for example, \\"The Forbin Project\\" (Yes, I know they're the same thing) in a breakneck thrill ride that will leave you exhausted by the end, and absolutely delighted that you took the journey.  Harris, who writes speculative fiction thrillers that make Michael Crichton look like Danielle Steele, outdoes even marvelous fun of \\"Fatherland\\" in what I consider his best, and certainly most immediate, novel.  Get it now, because, if it is at all prescient, this could be your last chance.

B004NSULHM|5.0|I'm going to preface this with saying that an opinion is an opinion, different for everyone, especially when it comes to music/art. Also this review may be bias because i am an avid Radiohead listener.  This album is very deep, with tons of layers, best listened to on vinyl to appreciate the dynamics. Yes, it may be a bit mellow and anti climatic, but i think that's what this album was intended for doing. Very ambient, and lets your mind wander... overall id put this near the top of my favorite Radiohead albums. Even though they all are epic... (...Pablo Honey... mehh)  throw on the turntable, sit back, and pump this through your AKG's...
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I bought this app on sale for 99 cents. After enduring a couple of years of middle-of-the-night insomnia, I was willing to try anything. I downloaded a few different sounds, then settled on \\"Distant Thunder 1\\" as my favorite. Sure enough, it's been working for me all week! I set the timer to 30 minutes, just to be sure that I'm sound asleep by the time it shuts off, and I don't wake up again until my alarm goes off. I really thought I'd have to get some prescription sleep aid from my doctor, but this app did the trick for me. Highly recommend!

B0064NTZJO|5.0|A ton of love and hate for this film, but I went in undeterred to see if Ryan Gosling could finally be in a worthy Blu Ray - and I discovered he found his way onto a great product preservation here.<br /><br />The story follows the \\"driver with a code\\" formula who falls in love with a lady and does things to mess with the code (actually that summary is virtually taken from the producers of the film, they themselves admitting there was nothing different about this film - except for how it was filmed). The Blu quality is amazing, and depending on the scene it will be testing your blacks and dark motion sensitivity to the extreme. There are two LA skyline night shots that are worthy of pausing and looking for detail clarity. Several other shots with different cameras are almost Michael Mann-ish in their grain and coloring, but so is a lot of this film. The sound is a mixed bag - beautiful yet possibly dangerous depending how high you might be cranking it up to hear the center channel subtleties laced for 15 minutes - followed unexpectedly with a flood of high pitches/decibel increase (follow the hints with the music - when it starts to fade or the lights are coming back to brightness after fading - quick turn it back down before your center gets blown). The DTS is great in the two main chase sequences and the motors were overamped just right.<br /><br />The special features are definitely a mixed bag:<br /><br />* Cut to the Chase, 4:35 minutes. Listed it first because this was the one I had the most interest in...specifically how they pulled off that reverse 270 with the actress in the shot. Unfortunately this was way too short and only glossed over what should have been a 30 minute piece on the stunts...worthy enough though to discover that sequence was not CGI.<br />* Driver & Irene, 6:14 minutes. This and the next two are so clip-heavy they provide so little substance - all forgettable. This one follows the love story angle with talking heads and clips.<br />* Under the Hood, 11:50 minutes. Not what I had hoped as I was looking for car and motor info. Instead it is an extremely clip-heavy talking head piece about the actors and their takes on characters.<br />* I Drive, 5:26 minutes. A confused quip that looks like it was cut from the the prior segment about actors working with the director.<br />* Drive without the Driver, 25:41 minutes. Wow, I cannot think of a more boring way to get all of the information that leads up to the film being made, how it was cast, and so forth. The director (who I respect from his prior work - he assuredly has an eye for filming) sits on a hood of a car and rambles for 25 minutes about the process, essentially a commentary - but as an interview. If you are fans of commentaries (which I am) then you will dig this segment - otherwise a skipper.<br /><br />Overall a fascinating look at a performance film preserved on a solid Blu that has a great picture quality and test-worthy sound, the supplements ding this from being a five but there are no half-stars here...4 for the film and BD specs, .5 star for the supplements.had hoped as I was looking for car and motor info.

B005BUZJ6O|5.0|I saw a magazine with them on the cover once, but haven't thought about them since then.  When i saw the Amazon Daily Deal, I just thought, \\"Where have i seen that picture before\\". So, I listened to the 30 second previews and thought the initial \\"that's cool, i guess\\", but on 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', my heart absolutely leapt out of my chest and wept in wide-eyed amazement at the talent. I recomend this album with the upmost passion and gladly paid for it. As I write this comment, I am listening to it for the nineth time and I am simply dumbfounded. So glad I checked Amazon's Daily Deal today!

B003L1ZXCU|5.0|Deamon is an outstanding book of what the future may hold for us all. In short, it's about a video game designer who creates a virus shortly before his death that is hell bent on taking over the world. This virus, the Deamon, responds to events in the news and on the internet, recruiting humans to aid in its battle with corporations, spammers, and law enforcement. This book presents ground-breaking technology of today in a way that glimpses the future. From heads-up-display glasses to darknets, automated vehicles, and bringing cyber warefare to reality. After reading this book I decided my career, oddly enough working for the government, was outdated. So I gave up a career and went back to school to study engineering. Deamon may seem far fetched, but as you read ask yourself this: What would I do if this came true? Would you know the technology and have the capabilities to survive in this near-future environment? That's what scared me enough to return to school. An amazing book.

068484267X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it showed a lot about the poor of Ireland and the Irish men who all had one weakness the drink.  It shows a lot about the catholic church and it also make me understand why my relatives were thought of so badly when they came to America.  The Irish in the book were poor and relied on the government and the men leave their children and the mothers don't know what to do.  I saw my own family in this story, especially my Grandfather.  I saw the real Ireland not the land that is told about in fairy tales.  Ireland has come a long way and is so much better for it.  This is not putting down the Irish this is showing how the survived.  I am amazed that the Mc Court family did survive but I am so glad they did we had a wonderful story teller in Frank Mc Court.

I came away with a really satisfied feeling.  The end is not expected and with all the horror the end leaves you with a smile.  What an amazing author and what talent.  Don't miss this book if you want to be entertained and enlightened about Russia and the KGB.
0439023513|1.0|This my first ever review for a book although I read a lot. But I felt compelled to do a review because this book was a huge disappointment to me. The only reason I started reading the series was because I saw that they will be making it into a movie and the only reason they would do that is because it's a good series.  Like everyone else I LOVED The Hunger Games and Catching Fire was really good. But this book was bad from the beginning till the end and I don't know why I kept reading it, probably just to find out how bad it could get.  It dragged and dragged and I started skimming pages. All the Characters that I loved from The Hunger Games, Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch, changed completely and you can hardly relate to them or recognize them.  Peeta was so damaged and changed, and Haymitch, I feel so sad for this character. One of the most important and you can barely feel his dry humor or presence in this book.  And Prim, poor Prim, the whole story started with her and I guess the writer though she wants to end it with her, but it was such a bad ending. I didn't feel anything for her death which means it was pointless and bad.  What's really disappointing was that by the end of the book, I really hated Katniss and I wanted her to die. I thought that would be a great ending to our misery and her and Peeta's misery. I can't believe that she voted for the repeat of the Hunger Games for the Capital children. That's so against everything that Katniss presents. What a bad move from the writer.  I just hope what ever damage was done with this book could be hidden in the movie and we can get some kind of closure instead of this dissatisfaction.
B000HL093A|5.0|I should warn the reader that I am a grad student in philosophy so my review drifts off into fairly lengthy discussions of some of the philosophical issues raised by this film. If that kind of thing does not interest you I would suggest skipping my review.<br /><br />This is, apparently, one of the most controversial movies ever made. That, on its own, does not necessarily make it a good movie but the movie does possess one quality that I think all genuinely good movies should possess, and that is memorability. I do not actually watch very many movies but sometimes even I have trouble remembering what happened in movies I know I have seen. Hollywood churns out so many movies and so many of them are just not memorable at all. Whether you love it or hate it there is no doubt that Natural Born Killers is memorable.<br /><br />I just re-watched Natural Born Killers, it had been years since I had last seen it, but there were scenes that I still remembered and that were still very vivid in my mind even years later. The scene where Mallory's incestuous and abusive family life is portrayed as a sitcom, with a laugh track that is activated after her father's incestuous comments, is one of the most memorable scenes in all of cinema (interestingly Quentin Tarantino, who wrote the original script for Natural Born Killers which was then heavily re-written apparently, really detested that scene and walked out of the theater. I would be very curious to know what he detested so much about that scene since, to me, it is one of the most interesting scenes in the movie).<br /><br />Despite being over the top in many ways the movie still succeeds in presenting real characters with true emotions. The characters are full blooded and well drawn. Mickey and Mallory are mass murderers and the movie does not shy away from that. But despite being a killer Mickey is still sentimental and romantic and Mallory is still insecure and jealous. People are fascinated by evil so a lot of times in movies like this they purposely make the characters as inhuman and evil as possible. This movie chose to present mass murderers as full blooded, and believable, human beings and I suspect that is partly what led to some of the controversy surrounding the film.<br /><br />The movie also avoids what I think is the biggest problem I have with almost everything put out by Hollywood: false emotion. Almost everything Hollywood puts out is so full of sentimentality and false emotion. In most movies and television shows there will be a moment of \\"emotional truth\\" where the character finally comes to some self-realization but when they attempt to express their insight it always feels to me like they are reading right out of a psychology textbook. Everyone feels the way they think they are supposed to feel rather than how they actually do feel. I think there are probably people who live their life that way but it seems very difficult for movies to reach any kind of emotional truth. They almost always blow it, in my opinion, either by simply quoting the textbook or by attempting to over dramatize it. This movie avoids all of that. There are realizations in the movie but they ring true rather than false (like when Mickey and Mallory are with the Native American in his hut and Mickey says, \\"You feel the demons in here Mallory\\" and she says, \\"I think we're the demons\\").<br /><br />The movie is also cinematically brilliant. It is shot in a very unique way cutting between black and white and color, real life and cartoons, with strange projections often playing in the background. That is part of what makes the film memorable and it can be disconcerting at first. The first time I saw the movie I really did not know what to make of it but the second time I watched it I felt like it all made sense and worked really well. The cuts often allow us to see the \\"outer\\" event and the \\"inner\\" event. The best example being from the opening scene in the diner where the waitress says something, it cuts to black and white and she says it again but in a way where it becomes clear she is flirting with Mickey, the inner meaning of the event is portrayed, which then explains Mallory's rudeness to her (and the fact that she cheats in her einee-meanie minie-moe game).<br /><br />The movie also deals with a number of interesting themes. Of course in interviews Oliver Stone always highlights the theme of the media and the way in which the media portrays violence. While this is certainly a theme of the movie I do not think it is the most interesting theme and, like T.S. Eliot, I do not think that artists are always the best interpreters of their own work. Oliver Stone may have meant the movie to be an indictment of the media but I think the movie is more than that, and much more interesting.<br /><br />Art, in my opinion, is about much more than aesthetics, or, what is sensorially appealing. Art should aim (like almost all human endeavors) at self-knowledge. One could blame the media for the sensationalism of violence but I do not think that the media is really capable of force feeding us something that we do not already have an appetite for. The really interesting question is a question that few people want to ask: what is it about human beings that makes us crave violence? Why do we like watching television shows about mass murderers and serial killers? Why do we like watching natural disasters on television?<br /><br />Some reviewers criticized Stone for pointing his finger at the media while being unable or unwilling to point it at himself. That may or may not be true of Stone (I do not know the man) but it does not seem to me to be true about the movie. Anyone who watches this movie, enjoys it, and then criticizes the media without asking themselves why they like watching a movie about mass murderers turned into celebrities is lacking in self-reflection. That is the truly interesting question. But it is not a question that we like to ask.<br /><br />One of the defining moments in the movie for me is when they are interviewing the teenagers who are fans of Mickey and Mallory and one of them says, \\"Of course we do not condone murder\\" but you can see the light in his eyes as he says it and the fascination, and even admiration, he feels for Mickey and Mallory. He is not lying. He really does believe murder is wrong. After thousands of years of moral education we are all ready with the judgment \\"murder is wrong\\". And that is a good thing. But there is still that strange fascination with violence. It is like an ancient and unused altar of human sacrifice standing in the square of a modern, civilized city. We are civilized human beings now but there is still this relic of something ancient within us. It is an artifact that we cannot quite explain. It is, I think, similar to what Edgar Allen Poe called \\"the imp of the perverse\\".<br /><br />I recognize it in various forms. For example, I was watching a show recently on super volcanoes. There is apparently a super volcano underneath Yellowstone National Park which, if it were to erupt, could be catastrophic for life on earth, and as I was watching I noticed a strange phenomenon. On the one hand, I wanted the scientists to say something reassuring like, \\"it is not expected to erupt for millions of years\\", or \\"of course, even if it does erupt we will have some warning and it will not destroy all life as we know it\\". But there was also a part of me that wanted the opposite, and that wanted them to say, \\"we have no idea when it might erupt\\", and, \\"if it does erupt it will wipe out life as we know it\\". This, to me, is part of the same strange phenomenon that this movie is addressing. We hate and fear violence and we find it morally repulsive, and yet, we are fascinated by it.<br /><br />Natural Born Killers is a violent movie but I think the controversy has more to do with the fact that it holds up a mirror to ourselves. We want to identify with our moral self and banish that strange relic from ancient times, or project it onto others, but, as Mickey says during his interview, you cannot run from your own shadow. There are plenty of movies that are more violent than Natural Born Killers but I think part of what makes Natural Born Killers so shocking, and why it raised so much controversy, is because it implicates us in that violence.<br /><br />We love violence but we also like to keep a safe moral distance from that violence. That is partly why we are so fascinated with the holocaust. We can indulge our fascination with violence, we can peer into the heart of evil, and exercise our moral judgment at the same time. We do not want to admit our fascination with violence so we turn it into a moral lesson. What is shocking about Natural Born Killers is the way in which it forces us to look at the violence within ourselves. We do not get to project our own violence onto the Nazis or anyone else. We see our own fascination with violence and I think people find that disconcerting. I know I do. Like everyone else I like to identify with my better nature, the angel on my shoulder rather than the demon.<br /><br />But I also believe that it is necessary for us to see clearly the violence within ourselves if we are to overcome it. Otherwise we act it out unconsciously. We identify with our moral selves and project our shadows onto the Nazis or the serial killer on television while exercising subtle forms of cruelty within our own daily lives. The one character in the movie that recognizes the demons within Mickey and Mallory on first sight is the Native American character but he is also the only character who does not engage in hypocritical forms of moral judgment. The cop and the warden both consider themselves morally superior to Mickey and Mallory, the warden scoffs when Mickey says that all God's creatures commit murder, and yet they are both just as violent as Mickey and Mallory in their own ways. The Native American character, however, knows and recognizes the demon, i.e. he is conscious. And he is the only character that has any kind of positive effect on Mickey and Mallory and who is not simply a part of the chain of perpetuating violence.<br /><br />Ultimately I think this movie deserves the highest praise for raising all of these issues and dealing with them in a fairly profound and also entertaining way. I read that this movie was originally based on a story by Quentin Tarantino but that Oliver Stone and company made some major changes to the script. Quentin Tarantino was apparently not very happy about their changes. On the one hand, I can understand where Quentin Tarantino is coming from. I would not like it if someone totally rewrote something I had written either. On the other hand, I am glad that it wound up being an Oliver Stone movie rather than a Quentin Tarantino movie. I have a feeling that I would not have liked the Quentin Tarantino version nearly as much. I do not have anything against Quentin Tarantino, I do like some of his films, but I have never liked a Quentin Tarantino movie as much as I liked this film, and no Quentin Tarantino movie has ever inspired the kind of philosophical thoughts in me that this movie has inspired. While I can understand Tarantino's frustration, from the standpoint of art I think things worked out for the best...f Mickey and Mallory and one of them says, \\"Of course we do not condone murder\\" but you can see the light in his eyes as he says it and the fascination, and even admiration, he feels for Mickey and Mallory. He is not lying. He really does believe murder is wrong. After thousands of years of moral education we are all ready with the judgment \\"murder is wrong\\". And that is a good thing. But there is still that strange fascination with violence. It is like an ancient and unused altar of human sacrifice standing in the square of a modern, civilized city. We are civilized human beings now but there is still this relic of something ancient within us. It is an artifact that we cannot quite explain.

B005G0ETV0|5.0|28 January 2012 marks 125 years since Rubinstein was born. A great time to consider his legacy in this marvellous set.  The title words to this review are those Harvey Sachs uses in the liner notes to the original Rubinstein Collection to describe how those of us who were lucky enough to hear Rubinstein play live felt after one of his performances. As Sachs says, those words also describe how one feels after hearing Rubinstein's recording of Chopin's B Minor Sonata.  This set is full of such wonderful performances. The recording of the Busoni arrangement of Bach's Chaconne is titanic and must rank among the greatest piano recordings. It exemplifies what Eunice Podis (quoted by Sachs in his excellent biography of Rubinstein) says of Rubinstein's ability to shape very long legato lines, especially in Chopin. Barenboim, also quoted by Sachs refers to something unerring about Rubinstein's healthy musical intellect and Jeremy Siepmann in sleeve notes to the BBC Legends series speaks of his powerful, all embracing sense of rythm, stating that his playing was straightforward, natural simple and healthy. Siepmann also refers to Rubinstein's ability to hear and balance voices in single chords.  Then there is Rubinstein's natural and delicate use of rubato and his gloriously beautiful tone. I would add to the learned opinions above that Rubinstein's sheer love of the music he plays shines through time after time.  You will hear and be touched by these qualities countless times throughout this set. Listen to the delicate weaving of Chopin's Nocturnes, especially Op. 55, no.2 in the 1967 recording and the powerful sense of structure in his Ballades and Scherzos. The recording of the F minor Ballade is another towering performance.  The 1932 recording of Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto under Barbirolli is out of this world and the Andantino unbearably beautiful. This recording also demonstrates the amazing clarity of even the earliest recordings in this set thanks to the legendary Fred Gaisberg who produced the original recordings and to the painstaking transfers by Ward Marston.  Going to the very end of the set, despite some imperfections, Rubinstein's Decca recording of the Brahms D Minor Concerto with the Israel Philharmonic under Mehta is of such intensity and so full of love for the music that for me it is an essential reading of this great work. Rubinstein was 89 with only one more recording session to go and weeks away from his final ever recital at London's Wigmore Hall on  31 May 1976.  Unusually for such a prominent musician, Rubinstein recorded a lot a chamber music and there are many beautiful chamber recordings here. No less of an opposite in many ways to Rubinstein than Glenn Gould was quoted in Look magazine in 1971 as saying in an interview with Rubinstein that the Rubinstein/Guarneri Quartet recording of the Brahms Quintet was the greatest chamber music performance with piano he had heard in his life and that the recording had changed his view of what Brahms represented.  One of the pleasures of the set is a wonderful photograph of Rubinstein and Gould in the beatifully illustrated and well set out book which accompanies the set.  In addition there are lovely reproductions of the original LP sleeves and the CD's (with the original LP length programmes) are illustrated with the original labels and made to look like mini records. The earliest recordings are in covers cleverly representing 78's in plain sleeves showing only the record label. It is all a pleasure to look at and I find the original LP sleeve notes legible despite their reduced size.  I am still discovering new beauties in the original Rubinstein Collection after ten years and have returned to favourite recordings dozens of times.  Buy this incredible bargain set: 142 CD's (the equivalent of 95 full length CD's) and 2 DVD's for the price of about 20 CD's. It will reward you with a lifetime of pleasure.

B0073PZIYI|4.0|Saw trailer for this in movie theater before it played in theaters and did look interesting but never got to big screen to see it. And, \\"interesting\\" it was. Premise is interesting and well thought out as it pertains to movie, characters and action. Not sure what to call main character. Hero? Robin Hood? Partly my problem on how to describe main male character is that the \\"villians\\" are not very strong characters. I dislike them for different reasons but I do not hate them and thus importance of main character is diminished. Perhaps Robbin Hood character is best description. Heroine??  Wishes she had been more attractive. Terrible thing to say, but in that middle ground between \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and Charlize Theron. She not either of these and detracted for me. So, in the end, a decent action film and recommended as that, action. Premise is interesting but not all that much to ponder or debate like some SYFY does, or can do.

B005UKJX4E|1.0|Ok, to start: (1) knew nothing about this film when I rented it other than it nominated as best picture of 2011 and (2) did not and could not make it all the way through this film. With that said, no idea why anyone would think this film is anything other than a total waste of time. \\"Artsy\\" comes to mind. Over-reaching, comes to mind. I do appreciate when one tries to encapsulate some aspect of living such that it is conveyed to others, actually conveyed, much as real art tries to do, but this picture is a total failure. I can not believe that the first 35-45 minutes was this terrible mismash of special effects about our planet forming and early life. Duh, been done so many times and ever so much better than this movie tries to do. Enough. Not recommended at all.

B005QJZ5FA|4.0|On the internet, it's impossible to navigate through the waters of indie pop without encountering the firestorm over Lana Del Rey.  A surprising amount of consternation, anger, and love has been expressed by the masses over this fresh face in indie (and one of the biggest arguments is that she is NOT indie whatsoever).  Some also say that she's a terrible musician; everyone saw the disappointing SNL performance, so I won't even bother going into details about that.  The biggest argument out there is that she's \\"fake.\\"  Her lips, her name, her whole persona... it's all an invention.  Well, without buying into the hype, or anti-hype, rather, I prefer to judge music for the... well, music; not the blog-B.S. That surrounds it.  If it sounds good, it has my attention and I will listen to it.  It's as simple as that.<br /><br />The following is a song-by-song review of the album.  Some people appreciate this type of review and others do not.  If you fall into the latter camp, scroll to the bottom for my closing thoughts.<br /><br />Born to Die - The album opens with a breathy Lana, crooning over a Twin Peaks-esque guitar line tucked carefully behind layers of programmed strings.  A fitting introduction to the new world of Lana Del Rey (10/10)<br /><br />Off to the Races - This song is interesting because it introduces elements of hip-hop into Del Rey's sound.  When she raps and her vocals are doubled, it's reminiscent of the band Why?.  So far, so good!  (10/10)<br /><br />Blue Jeans - It becomes apparent at this point that we're probably going to hear that screamy, awkward loop throughout the album (some guy screaming \\"Lana?\\") and it gets a bit irritating.  Aside from that, the atmospheric strings and guitar help move things along.  (7/10)<br /><br />Video Games - This is the song that put Lana on the map, and it's easily the best on the album in every way: lyrically, melodically, production-wise, etc.  If you're new to the LDR hype, listen to this one first.  It's a good litmus test.  (10/10)<br /><br />Diet Mountain Dew - This song could easily transition to the radio with its chorus-centric formula.  It's also interesting that this song marks the third Mountain Dew inspired indie song (behind those penned by Daniel Johnston and Beck).  (7/10)<br /><br />National Anthem - We have reached the point in the album where things get a little shaky.  The lyrics are pretty bad here, guys.  Normally, LDR's lazier lyrics don't bother me but here they're practically thrown in your face.  \\"Money is the reason we exist, everybody knows it, it's a fact, kiss kiss.\\"  (4/10)<br /><br />Dark Paradise - That screaming guy buried in the mix makes his grand return (why was this thrown in there so often?) but the song itself is a decent ballad that gets a little danceable at certain points.  (6/10)<br /><br />Radio - Another album standout, Radio is instantly catchy.  The vocal melody is among the best of her repertoire.  Easy one of LDR's best.  (10/10)<br /><br />Carmen - Was this song written for the next James Bond film?  It definitely drives her style home, with its film noir vibes and smoky bar crooning.  It's called Carmen for god's sake.  What else do you need to know?  (6/10)<br /><br />Million Dollar Man - This song strikes me as an attempt to reproduce \\"Video Games.\\"  It's strikingly similar.  It's not bad, but it's not terribly original either.  (7/10)<br /><br />Summertime Sadness - The dramatic strings and bells at the beginning seem to suggest that this song takes place in early 1900's Mexico, moments before a duel.  Lyrically, we have another clunker.  The music is decent enough to keep your attention though, even though the chorus is similar to that of \\"National Anthem.\\"  (5/10)<br /><br />This Is What Makes Us Girls - A fitting closer, This Is What Makes Us Girls sums up the character of Lana Del Rey: it has the programmed strings, the screamy-guy loop (such a bad decision), the somewhat grating lyrics \\"Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice\\" (were her producers attempting to establish hipster credit with that line?), and the uniquely excellent voice.  Take it or leave it.  (9/10)<br /><br />Overall, LDR's debut is a bit uneven and somewhat repetitive but overall, quite catchy.  I would recommend that everyone set aside their preconceived notions of Lana as a blog entity and give this album a shot.  Thanks for reading.re her producers attempting to establish hipster credit with that line?), and the uniquely excellent voice.  Take it or leave it.

B005I6EVUG|3.0|This cover, no doubt is beautiful. what I didn't think about when I purchased this cover is how much it will protect my fire (which I love to death!) Honestly it does offer some protection, but because there isn't an external strap that comes across the cover to make it stay, it doesn't stay closed.  For example:  When I hold my kindle, I fold the front flap over behind it so the kindle is easier to read, but in doing this, I stretch the front flap so now it wont lay flat like its supposed to.  And because there isn't an external strap to go across, the cover has an opening that leaves the kindle unprotected.  Now this would not be that big of a deal, if I just carried the kindle in my hands; But it is in my purse, along with my keys, pens, and other sharp or metal objects.  I would definitely recommend this kindle but only to people who are looking for something pretty to put on their kindle, not protection.

B005VPRFSY|5.0|This is Lego's second set featuring the escape pod from Star Wars IV, the first being #7106 from 2001. Introduced in January of 2012, set #9490 is certainly an improved design, the escape pod featuring a conical shape (rather than cylindrical as in the earlier set) along with nice thruster detailing at both ends of the pod. The shell of the pod lifts off to reveal seating areas for the droids and a control panel. Stickers decorate the side of the pod. There is also a little speeder bike included in the set, though a dewback would have been nice.<br /><br />The main reason to purchase the set is for the mini-figures; it includes four: R2-D2, C-3PO, and two Sandtroopers. C-3PO sports a new torso that allows one to see his mechanical/electrical innards at the abdominal opening; he also has printed eyes on his head. The Troopers have sand marks on them, giving them a nice weathered look, and they also have printing on their legs. Dressed in different colored pauldrons, I think these troopers are some of the best Lego has made.<br /><br />In terms of playability, this is a good set. Escape pods are single-use vehicles and are not given to dogfights or flitting about the galaxy. So the limited plot-line of the movie means kids have to be extra inventive. But the set makes up for this in plenty of mini-figures and just a nifty pod design. Given the assortment of fairly useful parts (curves and conical sections), this is a good value set. And since Lego only seems to offer an escape pod once every decade, well, here's your chance to get away with one.

0439023513|5.0|Although it is much darker than the previous novels of the trilogy, Mockingjay ends the story of Katniss Everdeen in a way readers will not forget. This final novel pulled away from the story of a love triangle, and brought readers into the realities and effects of war. Although the ending was not what I initially hoped for, I can truly appreciate it's effectiveness. A traditional happy ending to this trilogy would have resulted in another 'great read' that is easily forgotten. The realistic portrayal of a girl emotionally damaged by war haunts the reader well after the novel is finished. Mockingjay adds a complexity to the story that bring the trilogy to a much greater level of depth and insight.

B005H5H3LW|4.0|This review is for the Thin Case DVD version of the Space Battleship Yamato movie (Purchased from Amazon/Far East).  The case is thin and comes in a cardboard sleeve.  The DVD sits very tight, more than I'm comfortable with, inside the case holder.  The art on the cardboard cover is much richer in color than the art on the case.  I'm not sure if this is a defect in the DVD or is a result of a flaw in the movie itself, but there was 1 scene where color was off/separated, as though the DVD might be faulty in this section.  I have only bought this one, and have not seen duplicate complaints about the color issue in one scene so I suspect the DVD may have been damaged or some other physical problem with the product.  It could also have been my player, but it did not happen with other movies and would occur every time in this one scene in the movie.  Miscellaneous notes not related to the Star rating:  I'm new to this anime series. Having just watched the original I was excited to see there was a live action version and that it was getting decent reviews. I found the movie followed the original story closely enough for what is possible to accomplish within the confines of a live action movie.  Some parts are extremely rushed, but it was still quite enjoyable.  This should be a part of anyone's collection that is interested in the genre.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the first book I purchased specifically for a Kindle, and not a Kindle for PC. I was so excited to read it on my new device, and it was the first book I read start to finish on my device. I couldn't put it down.<br />From the start when Katniss volunteered herself to save her sister all the way until the end when she has to make difficult decisions for herself, and her new friend, Peeta, I was with her the entire time. Every decision that the Capitol made to make the Games harder, every time Katniss had to watch someone die for no reason, I was right there with her, feeling exactly the way she was. I was so engrossed in this novel that I bought the second one the moment I finished this one. I can't wait to finish Catching Fire!
B002A97IJ0|4.0|If you are the type of person that likes to take something out of the box and install it right away, then these fans will not live up to your expectations of quietness. Running on the 12V molex connector they are quite audible, even in a modestly loud environment. For a recording studio or HTPC set-up these will definitely not be the right fans! That said, if you are like me and you don't mind a little DIY'ing, then with a little bit of solder and a couple of resistors, you can drop these babies down to about 60% power, keeping their efficient cooling properties while minimizing noise. Zalman actually makes a pre-made cable with a resistor, it's worth a google.<br /><br />Anyway, I dropped the power down, installed these into my Lian-Li PC-V353A case that had no room for the usual 25mm width and am now enjoying cool ambient temperatures!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Thin!<br />- Relatively quiet for a slim fan like this<br />- Cheap<br />- Scythe has excellent customer support<br /><br />CONS<br />- Louder than regular-width fans (this is basics physics and almost unavoidable)<br /><br />OVERALL<br />If you're looking for a quiet, efficient fan out of the box, this isn't for you.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|Update: I've decided to pull my original review because it's long and unwieldy. The important part is this:<br />I've had this knife for several months now and put a lot of work into it. I absolutely love it and it remains the best knife I have yet used. I'm able to baton through wood wider than the length of the blade with ease(almost exclusively elm, and a quick search can tell you why elm is a pain to split). I've been able to chop 6-8 inch branches off trees in three hits a number of times, five being an average.<br /><br />However, time and time again it's not the amount of work I do with the blade that dulls it, it's how many times I slide it in and out of the sheath. By now I've got a routine of sharpening the edge (done extremely quickly with the excellent 1095 steel) after a long day's work and it's somewhat meditative. Throwing in a light coat of oil extends the meditation and is necessary care for the blade regardless.<br />I'm not sure if it was the manufacturer's intention to force you to sit down and care for your knife after a hard day's use but if you don't mind that then this one is worth a try.
B001O54NKS|4.0|While Don Dokken's voice leaves a lot to be desired, you can't help but dig George Lynch's blistering solos that are littered throughout this release.  They alone are worth picking up this or any Dokken record that he was a part of.  I recommend this record because it is a good, not great, record that is enjoyable with a lot of tracks that will have you singing right along with them after maybe three spins of this CD.  If you like melodic 80's cheez metal, this is a good pick for your money.

After reading and watching videos on how this product kind of works and doesn't, I was really surprised it worked, and worked pretty well.<br /><br />This is what I did.<br />Put on the Zoom and made sure the lenses clicked into place.<br />The product kind of worked with the Kinect, however everything was a bit wobbly, so I needed to do the calibration (with the card).<br />After I did some sensor testing and we are off.<br /><br />Note:<br />- You need to make sure the area you are playing is brightly lit.<br />- You will need to play around 3 feet away from the sensor and the kinect will not need to be mounted on the TV.<br />- The sensor is more sensitive too, so instead of wide movements you will need to do a little less that before.<br /><br />If you live in a small apartment try it out, it worked for me.<br /><br />Update:<br />This works pretty good for single player. When you have 2 people, this become difficult. I tried Dance Central 2 with 2 players, and about 30% of the time the moves did not register properly. Also when you're playing towards the side of the kinect, you get a fish-eye effect (arms appear curved when your arms are straight). It was pretty frustrating to navigate in Dance Central when there are 2 people, that I needed to use the controller.<br /><br />Also if you stand around 6 feet from the kinect, it will not register you since the zoom makes everything a tad darker.<br /><br />Update 2:<br />I found that the Zoom takes away the accuracy of the Kinect around 30%. I used this on Dance Central 2 again, and found it difficult on single player. I was getting around 2 stars on difficult songs, however after removing the Zoom, I was received 4 stars without an effort.<br /><br />If you wear black / dark clothes it's really hard for it to register you, also you need a really well lit area as well.
B001EN71HC|5.0|The movies were already so good to begin with. Having them on blu-ray is even better. Plenty of extras. Great quality.
B006W0QOF2|2.0|Gosling plays a protagonist with few words and fewer action scenes. They spend more time shooting his morbid facial expressions than they do on the action scenes. The movie dragged on with a few hightlighted scenes. The best was probably the hotel scene and the car chase where he kills Ron Perlman's character. I was hoping for more car stunts or chases, but it didn't happen. There was no explanation why Gosling was so withdrawn. The plot was interesting but between the lack of dialog and the wierd music, the movie seemed out of place. It was a yarn for me, but If you're bored and it's raining outside, I guess it will do.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is so much fun. I like how I have to earn the different games, however some of the &quot;prices&quot; are VERY HIGH! Mini games range from simple to quite difficult, which is good, both my son (4 yrs) and I can play.
1592537251|5.0|A wonderful book that takes you all over the world one drawing at the time. Fantastic concept. So much talent FANTASTIC!
B0034G4P9E|5.0|First off I have to say that I was not a fan of MMA before seeing this film. What drew me to it was the belief that it was more than just a sports film, that at the heart of the film was the relationship between the two brothers Tommy(Tom Hardy) and Brendan(Joel Edgerton). That belief was completely correct, this film manages to tell a wonderfully sad and ultimately redemptive story while at the same time being very respectful to the sport of MMA fighting.  The story of course centers around the two brothers, who are very much estranged from each other and their father, Paddy(Nick Nolte).  All three characters have issues but the most damaged is war vet, Tommy, who is played beautifully by Tom Hardy. Nick Nolte is also amazing in this as a former alcoholic who is now several years sober and trying to repair his relationship with his two sons. Although I gave lots of praise to Hardy and Nolte, I in no way mean to leave out Edgerton's performance, as I had really little interest in his character, a former UFC fighter turned high school Physics teacher trying and failing to make ends meet for his family, to begin with but I thoroughly enjoyed watching his part of the story unfold as well. I wont go in depth into the story but the basic plot is that both brothers make their way into SPARTA, an MMA fighting event put on to pit the best MMA fighters against each other until only one is left standing to claim the 5 million dollar prize, with the first part of the film focusing on setting up their personal lives and relationships with each other and their training for the SPARTA competition. The second part of the film features the brothers fights with other competitors, which are very cool btw, and leads into the conclusion of the film which I won't give away.  In all honesty I was expecting this film to be good but it completely blew me away with how great it turned out to be. It has incredible heart and lots of action and fighting, so for me it was the total package. Itis about family first and fighting second but the fighting is handled extremely well and is essential to the story and plot. If you like bonus features as I do this blu ray has a lot of extras to offer including a deleted scene, gag reel, and a couple different short documentary's on the research  that director Gavin O' Connor and the rest of the crew put into the film in order to make the fighting realistic and credible.  So, in short the story was great, the characters are complex and easy to connect with, and the fighting is exciting and realistic. I loved this movie and I can't recommend it enough to people, even people like myself who are not into \\"sports\\" movies,and by sports movies I mean a film that focuses mostly on the sport and the game being played not so much the character development or a bigger, overall plot. And there is nothing wrong with those films, what I am saying is that I believe this can be enjoyed by an even bigger audience. The MMA element while essential to the film should not scare anyone away from watching this great film. This gets a very well deserved 5 stars from me because it was awesome and I can't wait to watch this film over and over again. It's simply that great.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This is the best rendition of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice I have seen. I have two other copies - one is part of a BBC Jane Austen series and the other stars Kiera Knightly. Although the Kiera Knightly production is good and certainly entertaining I find this production the best as Colin Firth does an outstanding job in the role of Mr. Darcy. Highy recommend to any serious Jane Austin fan.
B0070Z4M4I|5.0|For any fans of the 1982 version of The Thing, you will not be disappointed. I don't understand the people that hate the CGI, they did a good job portraying the creatures that could not be done with the animatronics.  No Kurt Russel but still great!

B00425S1H8|3.0|I purchased a Plugable USB to RS232 converter to communicate with my Anthem MRX 300 A/V receiver. Though the software installation for the converter went without a hitch, I could not establish communication with the receiver. I tried another manufacturer's converter (also had a Prolific PL2303 chipset) and it didn't work either. The converter that reportedly worked with the Anthem receiver was the Tripp lite Keyspan USA-19HS. I purchased one, connected it to my laptop (Windows 7 64-bit) and let Windows install it. I had successful communication with the receiver on my very first attempt.
B000EQHHJW|3.0|I don't know.  I like it, but I don't.  I'm an avid believer that if you have a nice home theater setup with a large screen, then you should expect sharp visuals and clean audio.  Being an old opera production, the video shows its age.<br /><br />The audio and vocal performances are quite good, and will come across nicely with your home theater.  I would enjoy this much better if produced in HD but keeping the elegant staging.<br /><br />Now, for those that do not care if they see \\"film\\" marks, or the 3:4 aspect ration, this is a 5 star production.

B000E5KOJS|4.0|There are not many productions of this opera on DVD.  This particular production was produced with an impressive, proper for the time, staging.  I am not a big fan of this opera, but this production hit the sweet spot for me.  I was able to watch it throughout and enjoy it.  I don't think there is a better one.  I own another one, which I like the vocalists a bit more, but the modern staging and poor orchestration ruins it.  This is your best bet for a Cosi Fan Tutte.  It is quite enjoyable and the philosopher is played properly!  I only rate the item 4 stars because I'm not a huge fan of this Opera.  Otherwise it probably is closer to 5.

B003VANOFY|5.0|The configuration is easy, not really complicated, once you plug in the USB adapter your comp switches from speakers to the headset.  The battery lasts over 10 hours I use it daily for at least 4 hours, have to charge it every 4 days, your computer doesnt need to be on to charge.

B005LY4B0A|4.0|Love the strategic aspect of this game but it has several problems.  The display does not fit the Galaxy Tab screen so it's impossible to read everything.  Major loss when it comes to the tips.  When I bought the app the hints disappeared. They were available only on the free app, apparently.  After exiting and re-entering the game, it does not take you back to where you left off.  It also seems to have a problem with score retention.  These things are quite frustrating but I'm hopeful that these bugs will be fixed soon.  The game is challenging and fun.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I'm not sure how I feel about The Hunger Games. At the end of the day, isn't it about whether or not you liked it and would recommend it to someone else? Yes? Then, okay, consider me as giving it a thumbs up. The book is entertaining--you want to know what kind of curveballs Katniss and Peeta are thrown next during the actual Games.  On the other hand, as I think about the story as a whole (or perhaps as a \\"hole\\")...it's shallow.  Let's start with the love story. I could see all along and was expecting Peeta's feelings for Katniss to spark some sort of emotional turmoil within the heroine...she started to love him only because it meant survival. I have no issues with that. My biggest problem with the love story was this hint of a love triangle developing with Gale. Gale was present for all of one or two chapters. I don't think his character was developed well enough to make Katniss' conflicting emotions at the book's end believable. Someone in her shoes would have either been in love with Peeta or not in love (or not think that they might be in love) with anyone else. At the beginning, we're not given any reason to believe that Katniss might have feelings for Gale, and the fact that she starts considering that possibility two-thirds of the way through the book, with Peeta (who she thinks is generous and handsome) obviously falling hard for her, feels unnatural. In the end, the way the love story was left as a sort of cliffhanger was expected but it still felt shallow beyond that.  Secondly, I'm not sure I'd classify this book as young adult...and the fact that they say 13 year olds can read it is laughable. I'm an adult male with fairly moderate views, especially when it comes to violence and sex...but when I think of how this book will be played out as a movie, I feel that there's no way it couldn't be rated R, if the movie stays true to the book. Children are impaled by arrows and spears, creatures bite off huge chunks of other kids' legs, and Katniss is completely naked (in front of an adult man) on more than one occasion. I know she's not in the buff in any sexual situations but it still seems off to me. I don't know.  That said, as a communication professor, I enjoyed the book's study of reality television and look forward to seeing the movie. Going forward, however, the issues present in this first book, mostly as it relates to Katniss' character and her underdeveloped internal conflict, makes me question whether or not I want to read \\"Catching Fire.\\" That is my current internal conflict.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|Not bad at all.<br /><br />Have to admit at having deep reservations regarding Timberlake. His previous films were middling to barrel bottom. Few performers can transition readily between completely different mediums. Rarely will you see a writer make a great painter; a wrestler make a great singer. And based on what I heard from other scifi film fans when this first went into production, and my own experience, misgivings were not completely unfounded.<br /><br />So I admit at being happily surprised. He wasn't bad. In fact, I'd rate the film pretty good and his execution solid. Not that he's going to be queuing up to the award shows, but decent enough where I didn't cringe.<br /><br />It's a solid blend of several well-worn themes, drawing most notably from '[[ASIN:B0010YVCI4 Bonnie and Clyde]]'. But that's not a knock. Nothing wrong with a reboot, if it's done well - improving and not just rehashing.<br /><br />And it's clever enough to cover the thin spots, smart enough to push back heavy examination, and primarily - set on a solid action oriented pace so that you don't focus too hard on the loose underpinnings of the plot.<br /><br />My only serious critique, and I don't mean to take anything away from a very decent performance by the young songster, but I couldn't help but think how much better this could've been with Matt Bomer in the lead role; he played the disillusioned Greenwich swell.<br /><br />Just saying.<br /><br />Overall, a very entertaining and interesting film premise. Completely worth the funds and time spent.<br /><br />Movie Note: This wasn't the first 'Time Equals Life' concept to be produced. For those interested in film history, check out 1987's \\"The Price Of Life\\", which aired as part of a Showtime scifi anthology series.
0399226907|4.0|I bought my daughter this book at 1 year old and she wasn't too interested in it. Now that she's 18 months she loves to imitate the catepillar biting through the different fruits and foods. Beautiful illustrations. Another great work by Carle but not as great as Brown Bear or Polar Bear books.

0312641893|5.0|This book is absolutely phenomenal.  I never in a million years would have guessed that Ms. Meyer is a debut author.  Her storytelling capability is superb as is her writing.  The world and characters she has created will jump off the page and straight into your imagination. Honestly, with Cinder as my first complete read of 2012, the rest of the books I read this year have a LOT to live up to, whether they come from debut or seasoned authors.  Cinder isn't you usual heroine.  She's a tough chick who works as a mechanic for a living and what's more--she's not ENTIRELY human anymore, not since a surgery when she was young reengineered her as a cyborg.  Despite her make-up being 36.28% machine, Cinder has all the real emotions and feelings of a normal teenage girls...she just also happens to be able to disconnect her foot.  Without giving too much away, there's a lot of surprises in store for Cinder along the way.  What I REALLY loved about this story is that it is a wholly unique and beautifully done retelling of the much loved Cinderella fairy tale.  When I read a retelling of such a well-known and well-loved story, I hope that the author can find a way to make it completely new without butchering the story I already love--and Ms. Meyer has accomplished just that. I loved the futuristic world with its science fiction technology yet the somewhat classic feel/moments that relate the story back to it's East Asian roots.  I don't think that I can recommend this book highly enough.  I flew through the pages and I am sure that you will too! The characters are relateable even though they're so different from you and me and Ms. Meyer really makes the world come alive.  You'll seriously feel like you are walking through the streets of New Beijing with Cinder and standing on the landing pad with Prince Kai when the Lunar queen arrives.  The ending will leave you breathlessly waiting for the next chapter of the Lunar chronicles, which we will sadly have to wait until 2013 to read!
B0062P332Y|4.0|As with most action movies, some of the lines and delivery were trite.  But for the most part, the plot and acting was great.  With Statham, DeNiro, and Owen...how can you go wrong!
B0059XTUXQ|1.0|Yes. We get it. Meryl Streep is fantastic, and everyone knows that, and we could go on for ages about it and present her with yet another oscar nomination, predictably, but you know what? As Madam Thatcher says in a pivotal scene in this movie, one's life must matter! So I will give it to you straight. Meryl could also be starring in a lifetime movie of the week and it would have equal artistic merit as this mess.  As we all know, hollywood likes to consider themselves quite self congratulatory. They awarded an oscar to charlize theron because she went from so chic and lovely to well...we all know!  They awarded milk and crash because golly gee, social causes are important! This time around, the oscar reasoning behind support for the iron lady will be how hollywood thinks its actually cutting edge/hip to show conservatives as people with feelings.  We see Thatcher in her old age, going mad in her well lit apartment. Why not make it tragic? Instead of even a polanski-lite director at the helm, we have a unambitious style that fails to ever catch fire and instill passion the viewer, and a style that stifles even meryls performance.  Yes, she was the first woman prime minister but the movie of course fails to address her battles with sexism in a remotely compelling way. We are shown that her rise to power was due not to her intellect, but due to her audacity. Unlike say Milk or Bullworth, we see no hints of the wheeling and dealing apparent in any politicians ascent to power.  And it is beaten over our head in this movie that, despite her war mongering, union-busting ways, she was good intentioned toward the everyman! After all, she was a mother! I don't buy it.  But the true reason this movie will fade will be not due to the fact that it thinks its breaking new ground for pulling an ayn rand and showing conservative principles as daring and courageous, no. It will be due to the fact that it has no ambition for itself, which is ironic considering the subject matter. Itis literally about nothing. Whatever you say about this woman it's clear that she was quite a lady and she deserves an honest account of her life, at the very least. This is just bland whitewash.
B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|This is a fictional account based on factual components. The movie is the story of a group of Israeli agents who infiltrate East Berlin to capture a Nazi war criminal known as the Surgeon of Birkenau.  This character is based on the Dr. Joseph Mengele, the doctor at Auschwitz who conducted medical experiments on Jewish prisoners at the death camp.  He was also known as The Angel of Death.  The three spies, two men and one women, capture but fail to extract their prey from East Berlin.  The remainder of the movie is about the ensuing events and how the trio dealt with their failure, pragmatically, morally and emotionally.  I do not want to say too much to give away more than necessary.  The drama is gripping a times although there are events and attitudes that are at times not believable - for example the female's impulsive romantic involvement with one of her colleagues.  Also, the actor chosen to play the elder version of one of the two males was at times weak, and this weakness was exacerbated by the fact that he bore little to no resemblance to his younger self; in contrast, the older actor for the other male and the woman were plausible versions of their younger counterparts.  The movie does provide strong drama throughout and raises important questions about the value of life and the difficult choices one must make under trying circumstances, as well as the consequences of those choices.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|It took me awhile to get into this book, but once I did I loved it.  I got it as a gift from my wish list and it had been on there so long that I forgot why I chose it.  It is certainly easy to read and is alittle different coming from the English perspective but once it captured me, I was sold and flew through it, enjoying every minute and laughing out loud at many parts.  Very entertaining.
B00005JNS0|5.0|We had seen this movie before but it belonged to grandson. It's So creative! We bought Cars 2 and actually liked the first one best.  Grandson somehow goofed up his copy of Cars 1.

B00000DSEK|5.0|Ten years after Ozzy's impressive debut with Randy Rhoads on Blizzard of Oz, Ozzy was at a crossroads both personally and professionally. After Jake E. Lee left the band at the end of The Ultimate Sin Tour in late 87' Ozzy was left hanging without his superstar sidekick. After many try-outs with various guitarists, Ozzy found Zakk Wylde, only 21 at the time, to fill Lee's big shoes. Zakk was already a well-respected guitar player when he was in his late teens. He jumped at the chance to help Ozzy continue his successful solo career. Wylde still refers to Ozzy as \\"The Boss\\" to this day, a reflection of Wylde's deep respect for Ozzy as a fine muscian. Their first album together, No Rest For The Wicked had moderate success and spawned the single \\"Crazy Babies\\". Undaunted, Ozzy returned three years after this album in 1991 with No More Tears. The album clearly displayed much promise, as it quickly went up the charts to become Ozzy's first and only number 1 album. Elevated by such gems as No More Tears, I Don't Want To Change The World, Time After Time, Mama I'm Coming Home, and the mature and experienced The Road To Nowhere, all of which had killer videos and dominated MTV rotation until Metallica's Black Album, Ozzy was a force to be reckoned with. Wylde's playing was inspired and vigorous, bassist Mike Inez(who later replaced Starr in Alice In Chains), threw down impressive chops, as well as Randy Castillo on drums. The band, even though Inez and Wylde were some 20 years Ozzy's junior, developed a great chemistry that was displayed throughout the albums entirety. Ferocious leads with stellar perfomances by Inez and Castillo, and some of Ozzy's best vocals, put this album into the classic category. This album is a must have for Ozzy fans and muscians alike.
0618918248|4.0|If you're sitting on the fence as an agnostic, or are an atheist, this book will help steer you to have more conviction in your beliefs about religion and god. However if you're still a believer, I doubt this book will make you change your mind. Sometimes it's preaching to the choir. Still a decent read.

1612130283|2.0|I can't for the life of me understand why this book has so many five star reviews *raving* about the series. I thought for sure that it had to at least be decent, but it's poorly written to the point where I just couldn't keep reading. The female protagonist is the ULTIMATE Mary Sue, and the hero is stunningly gorgeous but came across as very empty and uninteresting. Nothing these two characters did together could have been interesting and I just didn't buy the chemistry between them. It's set in the USA but all of the phrasing and dialogue was British (I was born and raised in the UK and have lived in the US for 15 years now, so I think I can detect it better than most). It came across as a distinctly amateurish effort - if I want to read erotica, I'll buy Emma Holly next time, thanks. This just read like weak fanfic that I could find anywhere on the internet for free. Amazon ought to rethink the price of this title given the quality of the work.
B003NTMREM|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show. I am a big fan of Dr. Who, so when I got Amazon Prime and saw that this was for free, I thought \\"Why the hell not?!\\" I was not disappointed. Action-packed cop-ness with a Sci-fi twist! However, if you want a familiy-friendly, nice \\"good vs. evil\\" and \\"good guys catch bad guys, hoorah!\\", this is not for you. Contains strong language, violence, and the occasional sex scene/reference. So, if your fine with that, WATCH THIS SHOW! The only real complaints I have are that Jack is a little meaner than I would like (but its understandable) and Gwen cries too much. 5 stars!
B006ZBRMOU|2.0|Let me start this review off by saying that I'm staggered that there were romance fans out there bitching about Kresley Cole's Lothaire being $11.99 on Kindle, and yet this book sells for $9.99 without many complaints. Unbelievable. This, like the other installments in the series, reads like Mary Sue fanfiction. I don't want to entirely spoil the ending for anyone thinking of reading the book but there's one thing throughout the series that Christian goes to great lengths to avoid because it's something he DOESN'T WANT and yet when it happens, he throws one tantrum and it's done. Apparently this thing fulfills him and makes him happy according to the epilogue, but none of it seems convincing and so it's a flat fantasy world of how the author would like to think a man would react to these things as opposed to anything in character. The concept of a real D/s relationship in romantic or erotic fiction has so much potential but here it's just wasted.  Here's an excerpt of my review of the first book in the series, because everything applies here.  \\"It's set in the USA but all of the phrasing and dialogue was British (I was born and raised in the UK and have lived in the US for 15 years now, so I think I can detect it better than most). The heroine is supposed to be in her early twenties, but her inner monologue is constantly filled with things that belong to a woman in her forties or fifties. With that said, the book really feels dated and most of the efforts to be present or edgy just hit all wrong, like when Christian would say, \\"Laters, baby\\" to Ana. REALLY? The inner and external dialogue are so wrong sometimes that it's jerks you out of the book and grinds things to a halt. There's also a metric sh*tload of repetition in the sex scenes, the conflicts, and even phrasing. It just feels like we're circling the drain from about 100 pages in. I felt like if I read about Ana's 'inner goddess' behaving in certain ways (whether that be writhing or reading Jackie freaking Collins or doing the rhumba) I was going to throw the iPad across the room.  This came across as a distinctly amateurish effort - if I want to read erotica, I'll buy Emma Holly next time, thanks. This just read like weak fanfic that I could find anywhere on the internet for free. Amazon ought to rethink the price of this title given the quality of the work.\\"

B005V2EVBQ|3.0|To begin with, the overall looks of the cover are great.  The black blends and molds with the Kindle Fire but doesn't add much weight or bulk.  The interior is soft and protects the screen but, if you have pets, plan on keeping a lint roller near by.  And finally, the biggest downside to this otherwise great cover... the stand feature doesn't hold up.  A slight movement causes the stand to fail and the Kindle to fall.

In the real world, most businesses are not run with the business concepts communicated in this book, but if these are applied, there would be more successful businesses (and managers) than failures.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it rocks I freaking love this app because its got so many games and it never gets boring and its awesome
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this has always been my favorite app since months and months ago. I really like it. I'm 13 yrs old.
0452289963|5.0|I purchased the audio recording of this book, and every time I listen it just blows my mind.  Many of the concepts Tolle explains sound like common sense, and yet most people do not regularly practice them (myself included).  I take things personally and get my feelings hurt, just like anyone else.  This book reminds me that I can create a sane and calm space inside myself no matter what happens on the outside.  It also reminds me that life is a mirror, and however I see it represents who I am.  I choose to see this moment as bad, good or neutral.  Whether or not I want to make that a conscious choice is the question.<br /><br />That said, there are some new agey parts of the book that some people may feel are too weird to be logical.  As with anything else, you take away from it what you need and leave the rest.  In my opinion, this is going to be a book that takes on different meaning every time you read it (all depending on where you are in your life).
B0064MT1NU|5.0|I have to begin by stressing that \\"The Piano\\" is a really well-made movie in every sense. With good reason it was nominated for eight Oscars, earning three, as well as receiving 27 nominations and 58 wins in other circles. Now, after quite some wait, this magnificent film is available in its Blu-ray edition. And what a delight to the eyes it is!  Holly Hunter plays Ada McGrath, a mute woman who moved to New Zealand, with Flora (Anna Paquin), her young daughter. She is meeting Alistair Stewart (Sam Neill), her new husband from an arranged marriage. Once arriving to the island, she is left at the beach with Flora, their few belongings, and her piano. However, when Alistair arrives to pick her up, he informs her that they will not be able to take the piano with them, because the house is deep inside, and they can not transport it through the jungle. This breaks Ada's heart, for the piano is her most valued material possession.  Once at their home, Ada, for some reason, doesn't have chemistry with her husband - maybe because of the piano -, and they have trouble consummating the marriage. Enter George Baines (Harvey Keitel), one of Alistair's workers at the plantation, who goes to the beach, picks the piano, carries it with some guys through the jungle, and takes it to his house. This action makes Ada happy, but George takes advantage of the situation, by telling her that she can have the piano back if she teaches him how to play it. Of course, George has something else in mind, and, as you can imagine, there will be trouble in paradise.  \\"The Piano\\" is a beautiful movie to watch. It has lush cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh; excellent acting, which resulted in Oscars for Hunter (Best Actress) and Paquin (Best Supporting actress); great directing by Jane Campion (who won an Oscar for Best Screenplay written for the Screen); and awesome production design by Andrew McAlpine. Of course, we already now that Anna Paquin stole the movie - her charm is just mesmerizing. Thisis one Blu-ray to have. (Australia / New Zealand, France, 1993, color, 120 min).

B006OOHYIC|5.0|keep an eye on the clock while you play, else hours will pass before you realize it.  very addictive little game.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I enjoy this app immensely.  Its a great generator based synthesizer with plenty of sounds and ways to manipulate those sounds. incredibly easy to use and incredibly fun. It would have been nice to have a metronome for more advanced song structuring and melody design and a save function would be great as well. the record function is nice, but id like to be able to save node and note positions as well.
B006ZS81GG|5.0|I have to admit, I probably wouldn't have listened to this if it weren't for all the controversy.  I guess that's why they say any kind of press is good press, right?  Well, her underwhelming performance on SNL notwithstanding, I think she's very talented.  I love listening to her lyrics too, not just the music, and I feel that her lyric writing is very clever, especially on Dark Paradise.  I think it's a refreshing change from some of the writing out there today - I won't bother quoting the likes of Britney or Rihanna - but there are ways to sing about love and sex without taking away all the mystery.  At the risk of sounding old and boring, part of the fun is in what's implied but not necessarily spoken.  There is a dark sadness to this record that I find irresistible. People say she can't possibly feel this way, having grown up rich, but plenty of rich people have feelings just like the rest of us.  Money doesn't buy happiness and talent can come from anyone, anywhere.  Whether it's born out of poverty or wealth really makes no difference.  Try to put all that aside and give it a listen.  I'm glad that I did.  If any of you out there remember Nico, you might hear some of her influence in Lana's singing style.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|So I think everyone pretty much agrees that Lana's (Lizzie's) look and persona is quite manufactured--but to be honest, I don't really care. I dig the music which she happens to write all of (or most of-pretty sure all tho).<br /><br />Lana's uniqueness makes her music both good and bad. The songs I don't like--I tend to really dislike, but the one's I like--I really like. And the one's I love (\\"Off to the Races\\", \\"Born To Die\\"), I like a whole lot better than most of the junk that's come out lately, not to mention can see myself still listening to several years from now. Lana has a flare for theatrics and when she nails her self described \\"Gangsta Nancy Sinatra\\" persona, it's really solid music.<br /><br />Now whether you're into her grandiose hypnotic pop is another matter. I can easily see Lana just not being most people's thing. Her voice is interesting, though not technically correct--and the dispassionate delivery has been throwing a lot of people off. But there are people out there like me who love it.<br /><br />I think people's main problem is that artists like Gaga who have clearly manufactured personas, own and acknowledge them--while it seemed Lana was really trying to reinvent herself. Still, I can't fault her for finally finding a way to make people notice her. I hope by the time she releases her next album, this ridiculousness is over.

B004HHAQYM|5.0|I saw this on the Where's Eric site and just had to have it. It has got absolutely everything that is possible. I went to amazon when my local supplier could not supply (a second package eventually turned up which ended up as a birthday present for my brother) The packaging is great but, more inportantly, the music is second to none. I have had the cd on play in the car for around 4 months. My favourite cd of all time.
0618918248|5.0|Richard Dawkins' \\"The God Delusion\\" is a fantastic book. I, for one, loved this book and it has completely changed my outlook on life. Having been raised Roman Catholic, I was indoctrinated and literally forced into believing that there is a God. Let me assure you that I no longer believe this to be true and this book ensures that those bridges back to theology can never again be crossed. Although faith can be comforting, it is all a lie and Dawkins addresses this and some arguments, however erroneous those arguments may be, that have been made in favor of religion and against its mortal enemy, evolution. The theory of evolution is true no matter what theologians would have you believe. For those familiar with science, you know that the word \\"theory\\" means a lot more to the scientific community than its colloquial usage would suggest.<br /><br />Dawkins has quite a wit about him that makes this a pleasurable read. Admittedly, he can seem rather strident. Nevertheless, I think his remarks against religion are well-deserved and necessary. This book is a must-read for anyone that may harbor doubts about religion.
1419702203|5.0|This is an excellent companion to the Scorsese film. I missed out on the special edition bluray/book and found this via amazon. In hindsight I am glad I missed out as this book gives a lot more than the special edition. Lots of interesting personal items like the lyrics etc. Any fan of George will treasure this book. Thank you to Olivia, Dhani and Martin for a sensational package. The film is worthy of several Oscars.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|With each release, i am never disappointed, but the latest \\"Old Ideas' is the most beautiful, intricate,thought provoking tracks that provide a feast for the soul. What a treasure! Bravo, Mr. Cohen and his band,  I never want it to end. I own every release and never tire of them. I always have them close by on my ipod when I long for something real and beautifully put together to actually listen to the lyrics to ponder. This release has got to earn a place as one of his best,most brillant efforts to date.  The music,arrangements,and back up singers are true perfection, as I know the Webb Sisters and the imdomitable Sharon Webb are present to create this Masterpiece. I would give it 10 stars if that were an option!!!!!

B0063IH60K|4.0|It's always fun. Biggest down side is the pop up ads between games. If that is what it takes to keep it free, though, no problem. They just ask you to install other apps. Just a marketing tool. Rest of game is great.
B000000W5P|5.0|A great work of the Rolling Stones with the best sound quality from the first time this LP was remastered. Its sound quality is rather that the last special edition of 2,011.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|Drive is literally the best film of 2011. No other film does such an impeccable job of telling a story. Instead of focusing on heavy handed dialogue or adrenaline based cutting, the film focuses on carefully constructed characters and shots. Everything screams of subtlety and attention to detail. Drive will take you on an emotional roller coaster that you were not expecting.
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|This film simply rotted.  Shallow premise, low action, flat resolution of the plot...dumb.  Watch or buy... you lose.  I do not understand why some people rated this movie over 2 stars.  Who are such people?  Have they never seen a good movie?  Are all movies good from their aspect?  Such people are of the same group that rates mediocre restaurants highly, luring people with taste to visit them and be disappointed.  I learn this lesson again and again, but still make the same mistake.  If the mass of humans like something, it is probably mediocre.  That's how we obtain the leadership that we enjoy.  Avoid this film unless you can watch it for free.  Even then, you've wasted your time.
B003ELOQCA|5.0|FYI: This review is not so much a review of the concert/contents DVD as much as it is my personal experience of watching it.<br /><br />I have to admit that at my age (42) and *their* age, this is/was probably the *only* way I was ever going to get to see U2 in concert. While I've been a fan since the late eighties, I am NOT a fan of huge crowds. Unless I could have the insane luck of seeing them live at a tiny venue like SNL or something it just wasn't going to happen.<br /><br />I've seen some concert footage of U2 before and was always impressed - in one concert, can't remember which, Bono picks a girl out of the crowd and lies down on the stage, serenading her as they both look up at the stars. If I could only trade places for a few minutes.... but I digress. As much as I love their music, I never watched their music videos - not of U2 or any band for that matter because I like to keep my own imagery of what the music inspires in my head and for me videos interfere with that process; weird? - maybe but that's me, go figure. The concert video is another story though; I bought this DVD when U2 came to Utah in 2011 to make up a concert date and I was licking my wounds that I did not have the guts to brave tens of thousands of people to see them live.<br /><br />In the end, after seeing this DVD I am not all that sorry I missed the live concert.<br /><br />First, I am a normal, not die hard fan. I am 42 and not about to worship anyone in entertainment - so fanboi/girl I am not. Second I am not a audiophile, videophile or technically savvy person so if this video had serious sound or video or editing flaws I would NOT notice. That said, I think the whole thing was excellent. I can't imagine from *all* the views and vantage points that it would be any better actually having been there. After all even with perfect peripheral vision the most I would have been able to see is 180* not 360*.<br /><br />I set this up with a Bose sound dock and a projector on my living room wall; seated ten feet away, my screen was about 7ft by 10ft. If there was anything closer to being at the concert I certainly would like to know how to do that. We've all read the lengthier reviews, and we all know what we are looking for as far as what we want and expect from to footage, so hopefully it is suffice it to say I really, really enjoyed this concert via DVD and now I can cross one more thing off the bucket list.<br /><br />Highly recommended for U2 fans.t by 10ft.

B005HSG3VK|3.0|The case is lightweight and easy to use and the bright color makes the Kindle easy to find. I have a leather cover as well but see this cover as a great cover for travel and reading on the beach.
0525478817|5.0|I feel inadequate to review this book. I read it together with my wife, it was a very good book, and I'm glad I read it. That's all I have to say.  Okay, wait, I can add one thing now. As I wrote this review, a singer appeared on the morning show I'm watching, singing to a girl with epilepsy about how strong and amazing she is in her fight with suffering and pain, what a warrior she is. This book offers a much deeper perspective.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|i just wanted the 250000 points...  so yea this game is really hard... i like the snake game tho.. hah u just wasted your time reading this
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Wow, this app is just plain cool. While there really isn't a whole lot to do it still kept my attention and it will stay on my tablet. Watching the particles fly around as you move your fingers is awesome. There is just something about this app that is very calming and relaxing. It would be awesome if the developer could add some soothing soundscapes to the app that could match up to the movements on the screen.
B005HSL626|1.0|the game adds are freezing up the game, there are to many adds on the game to even play at all on the kindle they games will force a close because the game wont respond no matter how many times u try it will always freeze
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Downloaded this app thinking I'd part once our twice for a few minutes. Half hour later I realized how long I'd been starting at the little dots
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I would add some automated feature so I could just set kindle up and watch it sometimes instead of a required to interact. the interaction is nice and I like it. watching how things interact with certain motions and what it creates. the color feature is cool. being able to control repel or attract, level of gravity, etc is great.  though again it would be nice to see it automated as well. so on occasion I could just turn it on and sit back relax and watch it.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|If your phone can run it I highly recommend it, this and Ethereal Dialpad are amazing apps, I love the repel feature.
0525478817|5.0|I loved it. It was an easy read, but still wonderfully charming and bittersweet.I promise you'll fall in love with the characters of this beautifully tragic novel.
0062068423|5.0|I won't put down the plot of the book as others have done. After about the first 100 pages, as the others said, the action picks up -- A LOT!  But pay attention to the characters in those first pages, especially the WWII pages. A bit more difficult with the Norwegian names -- no Smiths or Joneses here.  It may seem confusing at times, but it all comes together.  The author keeps you guessing.  I loved it & want to read more from this author.  Ann
0375842209|5.0|I found this story to be haunting and beautiful.  I might say that this is the best book I have read in 40 years.  It is sad that the stories are so close to the truth of what had taken place in Nazi Germany.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Works great with my kindle fire. Doesn't use up much space. Doesn't drain my battery. Very addictive. Even learned a few tricks, like holding my finger on the screen, and making a circular motion on the screen collects all the dots and the cluster shrinks. I insist you get this app!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME !!! It has something for everyone. Weather you have 5 minuites or 5 hours you will love it..
B004MC8CA2|2.0|while using the search function I have found that many verses are off. I need this app to look up verses for Bible study but it does not always work. it is nice to be able to go through multiple versions of the same scripture though.
0439023513|5.0|I recently began reading the Hunger Games in High School, as we were all assigned to go out and get this book, and I immediately fell in love with it. I finished it in 2 days, so I ordered Caching Fire, and Mocking Jay. I love all 3 books, but I recommend you read the first 2 Books so you can understand why things are happening in Mocking Jay.

B005H0CBZ0|5.0|Another fantastic novel from the world's best historical fcition writers (IMO!).  Once again Diana manages to make you feel like you are there, as the story of Claire and Jamie unfolds.  Make sure you start it when you don't have to be at work the next day, because you wont be able to put it down!
B006ZBRMOU|1.0|I wasn't going to do a review on this but I feel I have to because for the price of this book is honestly not worth it.  Christian and Ana haven't developed at all from the previous books. It is - rinse, lather and repeat and rinse, lather repeat etc... I really felt that their characterization was regressing and not even the hot smex or some of the sweet moments saved this book. There was no plot. It just felt like complete filler and even the promise showdown with the psycho boss or Mrs Robinson was anti-climatic. A deflated balloon held more excitement with that ending. The coincidences which led to the ending was really outlandish. And seriously Christian if you are pissed off why go to a place like the Salon? You can't really go emo to a place where women are getting their roots done.  And whilst I liked the cheesy factor and HQN Presents elements (And this a person who dislikes Presents) in the previous books, this felt over-emotional and an over-wrought mess and it was tiring to read. I had trouble finishing the book because I couldn't get into the characters and I really wanted to like this. The only good bit was the epilogue which was very HQNISH but I think it was because the forced angsty elements were totally gone from that point however unrealistically because I think if this was real, Christian will never overcome his issues and past.  Disappointing end to a series that had flaws but it did have the cracklicious factor.
B005HCI72O|5.0|Drums of Autmun continues the story of Claire and Jamie and all of the other characters that we have come to know and love in the first three books.  As with the first three books, Diana's attention to historical details is amazing and so well done if the characters were real people you would think you were reading a history book!  A series that just keeps getting better and better as the books go one, the fourth one is just as hard to put down as the first three
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play. Reasonable amount of winning, but not too often. Works nicely on ViewSonic tablet. I recommend this app.
B006OT03BM|5.0|I'm not sure why some people say this is not worth the money.  It is marketed toward collectors and fans of Transformers.  If that is you, then this set is for you.  First, the box is huge for only three movies.  It is cardboard, not metal but it still looks amazing and is surprisingly well built with magnetic latches to hold it together as well as an aluminum plaque on the top of the box.  Second, you are getting the original two disc blu ray releases, with the bonus features of each as well as the seventh disc of Dark of the Moon in 3D.  No digital copies or DVDs.  Finally, $90 for not just the movies, but a show piece if you are into that kind of box set.  If you are only interested in the movies, then you should not be looking into \\"Collectors Editions\\" or \\"Signatures Editions\\".  If you are a fan like myself, I feel you will be pleasantly surprised by this set.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought this about a month ago for my son who is a very active young man who loves to carry around his Kindle every where and surely not much concerned about being gentle with it. The cover has lasted fairly well in its original condition and has proven effective in protecting the Kindle in it. It is very light weight and adds very little to the size and volume of the device. Looking at the options out there and considering the price point I believe we made  a good choice.
0439023521|5.0|This book was amazing.  Read it in one week and I have only read 6 books my entire life, now 27 years old.  Then I read the second book in a week and now on to the third.  Great books.

B0015DROBO|5.0|Slow to start but a great read, I couldn't put it down once it got going. I almost did not want it to end.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I thought this book was great, i gave it a four and half because of how the book ended i would have like it fast forward or the author spent a little more time to just round out the rough edges at the end. The romance in the book made me wish a i had someone to challenge me and love me like the characters did. They might be bad for each other but at the same time they are one another's savior it was great. I wish it didn't end or i could find a another book like that. The sex scene wasn't hot and steamy but definitely romantic enough for me to like the book.
0439023521|5.0|What stands out for this book is the imagination of the world Collins created. It is part mid evil arthurian tale, part blade runner and part gladiator all at once. You would think that could not work, but it does. The flexibility of placing the story in the future allows Collins to weave in unexpected things in, which might have been jarring, but it works the same way magic is use in the Harry Potter universe.  By far the strongest element of the book is the emotionally complex character and situation Collins creates.  Who do you trust?  Who is your ally?  What is the smartest way to play an impossible situation that the characters are forced into?  Each turn of events creates even more complex situation that if judge wrong can be fatal.  And most importantly who are the winners?  Like in war, can there really be a winner when you are a pawn in a game you never wanted to play in the first place?
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This it's a fun and addicting app. Very easy but very challenging as levels progress. There is a lot of good game play.

B0058EBNAO|4.0|DATA is accurate, however there is alot of it, making it a challenge to quickly review the weather outside. I do like the current conditions icon and temp readout at the top of my DROID display so I can tell if its raining, cold, etc.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this is the best ever even though I got it for free app of the day I stool would have bought. I got 24 hours ago and ive played it ever since

0312641893|5.0|Cinder is a story about a girl...living in a post-WW IV world, just trying to get by. Oh...also she's a cyborg. I want to start this review by saying that this book is a fantastically brilliant new take on the Cinderella story. It has all the qualities of a romance, sci-fi, mystery story that I was looking forward to. The love birds....two people who come from completely different worlds-a prince of a dying emperor, poised to take over the throne upon his father's death...and a female mechanic living in the overcrowded New Beijing Commonwealth. They meet by chance and after that there's lots of Prince Kaito trying to woo tragic little Cinder.<br /><br />Let's point out the basic Cinderella story qualifiers:<br /><br />1. Evil step-mother [in this case: adoptive] - CHECK<br />2. Father or adoptive father has died and evil mom treats our female protag like crap - CHECK<br />3. Bratty \\"step-sister\\" - CHECK (one of them actually loves Cinder)<br />4. An impending ball - CHECK<br />5. Creatures symbolizing the mice - CHECK (Cinder's android Iko is hilarious)<br />6. Forbidden to attend ball - CHECK<br />7. Dreamy prince charming - Um...big time CHECK<br /><br />Okay these are the basics that I was looking for...which lend some serious parallelism to the classic story...but what was different made the story go from good to Must. Not. Put. Down. First of all there is a plague that is running rampant through what is left of the Earthen population & cyborgs are being drafted & experimented upon to find the cure for the 100% human population...even the Emperor & Empress (Kai's parents) were not safe from this lethal, fast-acting disease.<br /><br />Oh and did I mention that there is an entire race of beings that live on the moon? Or Luna as it is called in the story...the Lunars are essentially slaves to the evil queen (another fairytale antagonist!). This story was nothing like I expected...I was actually apprehensive to read it, but it got to the point that I was staying up late, forcing my eyes to stay open and keep reading! I highly recommend this book...there are so many twists and turns, so many mysteries that need to be solved, and the ending will have leave your eyes wide and your jaw dropped. I absolutely cannot wait for the next book in the Lunar Chronicles....there are so many questions I want answered, so many possible outcomes, and so much adventure to be had! If you're tired of Cinderella stories, join the club...let's be honest...Drew Barrymore and ABC Family have seriously beaten this story to a pulp. But what Marissa Meyer has managed to do with her story...is absolutely, without a doubt, BRILLIANT. I look forward to this book (and Miss Meyer) being incredibly successful!ecommend this book...there are so many twists and turns, so many mysteries that need to be solved, and the ending will have leave your eyes wide and your jaw dropped.

B006GH6IS4|5.0|God...Freddie.<br /><br />How much we need Freddie in this world today. How much we need the \\"Queen\\" of this documentary...<br /><br />If you see NOTHING else, watch Brian talk about his dad, and playing MSG for the very first time, and \\"Love of My Life\\". That is as poignant, and spiritual, and lovely and wonderful piece of video as I've ever seen. And you watch Freddie's decline throughout the entire second part, and see how HARD he fought just to present a \\"whole person\\", where you could tell he was dying. Watching him perform the video for \\"These are the Days of Our Lives\\" is almost impossible to do, as poor Freddie just looks skeletal. And you hear Bri tell of a story where Freddie shows his leg to Bri while their are out on a break from a session (I'm guessing maybe it was some Kaposi's Sarcoma lesions on  the leg  or something), and Bri recoils---and yet Bri tells of Freddie actually apologizing for putting his friend and bandmate into such a position. Once again, just moving, and riveting. I'd also  never seen Roger cry---but  when he finally gets to the \\"end\\", he simply cannot go on. You won't be able to either. There are happy and victorious moments all throughout, but the second half is very difficult.<br /><br />I really hate that Deacon John decided to skip out on the whole music Kingdom, but I respect that; however, it'd have been nice to really have his current thinking in this wonderful and sensitive documentary.<br /><br />Queen is/was the smart man's Rock band. Bands from Metallica to the Foo Fighters to Bowie, to every football team (American and Soccer) around the whole world have enjoyed and been influenced by their music. This documentary is great at showing us why.<br /><br />Musicians will particularly enjoy the behind the scenes stuff, and the \\"layperson\\" will enjoy the human interest.<br /><br />This is a documentary/musical that is as important as the \\"Beatles Anthology\\"...almost.<br /><br />Don't miss it. See it...the price is amazingly inexpensive for the amount of material.<br /><br />RIP, Freddie...expensive for the amount of material.<br /><br />RIP, Freddie...

Otherwise, the only problem is that the radio stops playing about 5 minutes after the screen turns off.
1608191664|1.0|I started reading this book hoping I'll find some challenging facts and conclusions. None was found.  The way how author tried to prove his point of view are exceptionally shallow and erroneous. I tried not to pay attention to some flaws at the beginning, but further I read, more hard it become.  For example, author states that low inflation is good for economy and should be used as a tool to leverage growth. How is he tries to prove it? - by stating that Brazil and Korea had high growth rates at that moment - but without comparing them to other countries. He just stated - they had high inflation and hight growth rate - i.e. high inflation leads to high growth rate. Could it be true? - I think our world and economy is more complex and many factors should be taken into account, as well as these countries' economies should be compared to other similar ones that has quite close factors but lack of inflation.  Another example of author playing with factual base is about protectionism - he says that since US employed protectionists policies in previous centuries it is beneficial to employ them now and that free trade is bad since so many smart man in the past supported protectionism (quite questionable arguments and author isn't coming to conclusion by employing better arguments).  Or one more: he compares the US to China and India by stating that they achieve higher than US growth rate recently only because they do not employ free markets, forgetting that in both of these countries substantial growth began only when they liberated legislation (i.e. moved towards free markets). He also forgets or hides that grows in China and India highly were achieved because of cheap labor that leads to cheaper goods.  And there is much more and more examples of how author plays with the facts in the book. To conclude, author tries to prove his point of view by employing questionable arguments, that have nothing in common with scientific method and by doing so distort facts.  By the way, you won't find anything about capitalism about this book except continuing grumbling that it's bad and doesn't work.

0140143505|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />84, Charing Cross Road is a truly delightful true story of friendship retold through a series of letters that were written between 1949 and 1968. The friendship between Helene Hanff and Frank Doel developed after Helene had sent a request for a specific list of books to Marks & Co. in London. From there, the correspondence continued over the years between the two but also between the other employees of Mark & Co. and even with Frank's family who were grateful to Helene for her kindness as she would send them food packs when they were dealing with rations in London. Their friendship was quite touching and I enjoyed watching as their letters developed more personal touches over the years.<br /><br />\\"You see how it is, Frankie, you're the only soul alive who understands me.\\"<br /><br />Helene was always planning a trip to England to visit the people she had written to for a great many years; however, life forever got in the way and the trip simply never occurred. I loved Helene's sense of humor; she was quite amusing and incredibly charming. Reading the last page of the book made me sigh with longing... contemplating a different ending; one where Helene would actually make it over to England.<br /><br />\\"If you happen to pass by 84 Charing Cross Road, kiss it for me? I owe it so much.\\"

B00338QENI|5.0|When I first skimmed the Amazon description of this book I thought it HAD to be fiction.  When I realized it was non-fiction it just blew me away.  I learned a lot about our nation's race history of the mid to late 20th century that seems shocking.  I lived this era and had thought I knew most everything about racial issues during this time.  But after reading this book I now realize that I was pretty clueless.  The racial issues revealed by this book are ones that I found fascinating.  I enjoyed the book on other levels too.  But I most enjoyed the journey with this author as she discovered the story behind the HeLa line of cells, and the family associated with it.  The book is one of the best that I've read in the past 4o or 50 years.  It's a unique read.  Glad I heard about it and picked it up.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|This was the best film of 2011, hands down. With stunning attention to detail and story by director Nicolas Winding Refn, beautiful cinematography, and wonderful performances by the entire cast, this was a powerhouse film that should have received more acclaim than it did (do you hear me Academy ?). The tension from scene to scene mixed with the wonderful composition and performances made it a great film and one that rewards you upon further viewings. Do yourself a favor and watch it. Those who have complained about it are philistines/Vin Diesel fans.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|I have read a number of Reacher novels.  My Step-Father was an MP for a long time, so I have some sort of weird connection with Reacher and his military past.  Lee Child has always done a good job with his technical aspects until this book.  I know it is fiction, but Child normally reaches past that fact.  In this case there were a number of technical things that just weren't plausible like a getting a gun into the Pentagon ... Several things are left \\"open\\" and \\"unconcluded.\\"  I grew up in Waycross Georgia while the Railroad was still in full swing, so those things worked in an OK manor.  Good background on Reacher and his buddies, so reading this makes some of the other Reacher Novels much more clear, but the book could have been 30% or more shorter.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|This movie, along with part 2, is truly pathetic. One of my friends somehow convinced me to watch it, saying it was so much better than part 2, which I saw first. It is no better. It is just gore for the sake of gore. To people who say it has great storyline: no, it doesn't. The storyline is just an excuse to show innocent people be mindlessly tortured. I guess this film is loved by so many people because of all the sick freaks in this world, because seriously, who gets a kick out of this crap? Besides the sickos in today's society. I swear, mental therapists could make an entire living off of one Hostel fan. If you like this kind of thing, you are sick.
B006T5FDLG|2.0|Lars Ulrich is the worst drummer ever. He's basically working with one beat called a trash can beat that you learn when you first start out playing. If they had a decent drummer I would be able to listen to them. But he makes everything sound blase. And this one is no exception.

B003L77GRO|3.0|I was addicted to this show from episode one. I'd probably give the first four seasons five stars. This season was a letdown. After the end of Season 4, I was really curious to see how things would be resolved... and I was really disappointed in Dexter. The character, not the show. Rita didn't deserve what happened, and the kids sure didn't, but I'm sorry, Dexter did. It was all his own fault. He thought so too, but I think he interpreted it wrong. Dexter was convinced that he should have killed Trinity when he had the chance and everything with Rita would have been OK. Technically that is true. But my problem is this: in the beginning the series fascinated me because, while Dexter was a killer, it was a strange sort of justice. He was killing killers who had gotten away with it... killers who had fallen through stupid cracks in the justice system or just disappeared. With Trinity, this was not the case. The police had only just found out about him. If Dexter had not been obsessed with \\"satisfying his urge\\" (as if another killer wouldn't come up soon enough), the cops would have found him. HIS OWN SISTER was what, 5 minutes away from cracking the case? It was just so evil of Dexter to take that away from her... especially since she was one of his victims. Deb and all of his victims - and there were tons of them - will never have their closure. Maybe \\"justice was served,\\" but as far as all the people who lost their loved ones know, the killer is still out there having the time of his life. They deserved to see him prosecuted. I expected all of this - left over from Season 4 - to be resolved. Instead, everyone seemed to forget everything as Dexter proceeded to create a whole new mess. This includes him jumping into bed with Lumen the second she got over being attacked. Wasn't one of his big issues in Season 1 that he was so damaged he had no interest in touching women? He sure got over Rita fast. Because it was on Showtime I guess. And all so Lumen could decide to just walk out at the end, when Dexter has fallen for her. I assume that was because Julia Stiles was a special guest star all season instead of a regular star, not because of anything that actually made sense in the plot, so they had to work it in somehow.<br /><br />Besides all that, I had to watch the whole season. I will have to check out Season 6 also, to see how it all ends, seeing how I can borrow it for free from my library. (I hope it ends and doesn't go on to a Season 7. It just hasn't lived up the the standard it started at. Not that it's really at Season 6 now anyway. 12 measly episodes isn't a real season.)t walk out at the end, when Dexter has fallen for her.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'm going to keep this short as I'm not big on giving reviews but I had to give one after reading this book. In my opinion, this is the best book Stephen King has written in quite a long time. A must read for anyone who considers themself a fan of his work.
1442346949|4.0|I listened to the abridged audiobook.  Audiobook quality: Reading was clear, if a little flat.  The audio mastering could have been better, with the volume level changing a bit between tracks.  Content quality: The book does a great job of describing Steve Jobs, his ascent in the world of computers, decline, re-ascent to leading the world's most valuable company, and eventual demise.  The book doesn't pull any punches, painting a picture of a person who was mean, self-absorbed, perfectionist, visionary, and lucky.  Like life, it's not all good stories, lots of Job's life is not what you would hope for your children, both his behavior and the things that happened to him.  In all, the book was entertaining and gave what seemed to be a decent picture of Jobs, without painting him adoringly.  Worth a read, but not the world's greatest book.

B006W0QOF2|3.0|We watched this movie and had a very mixed reaction to it because there were great things about it and very annoying things about it.  I'll start with the great...the driving scenes, limited as they were, were full on exciting.  The general story was interesting and the acting pretty good.  But a few things we disliked so much that they really knocked down the enjoyment level of it.  The endless staring got really annoying. There were too many scenes with hardly any dialogue and just long stare segments, it felt overdone.  The nudity during a crucial scene.  Fine...if you feel you need to throw nudity in a movie to satisfy some viewers do it, but do it so that people who aren't into it can fast forward past the scene.  Don't do it where if you don't watch you miss a part of the story line.  And then the slap...there was a scene between a man and a woman and I saw it coming and said no don't do it, not the slap and then...SLAP.  It's such an overused cliche' in the movies where the female slaps the man that your left thinking, really?  You can't come up with anything more original or realistic than that?<br />I caught a goof too while watching...Driver goes to jimmy a car, has gloves on, opens car door...no gloves, sits down to drive, gloves back on.<br />Overall, definitely worth the watch, just wasn't as good as we were expecting.

So when we started playing, we were disappointed when we found out how limited the opponents were. This game is fun, but shouldn't be called real steel if you cant play, or be, all the characters.
B00447G29S|4.0|I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. I actually bought it looking for the 3D effects. Read some internet \\"Best 3D movie\\" recommendations and Polar Express was on every list as being a really good one. Most of the movie has great 3D effects as far as the \\"Diarama\\" type 3D. What I mean by that is there is a lot of depth. Like looking through a window. There is one great \\"Pop-out\\" scene where the front of the train seemed to come out about 4' or so. The wind-blown ticket scene is pretty cool too. One thing I wish wasn't the case.....the black bars on top and bottom format. I understand why this is the case with so many movies but it I still wish I was getting my whole 55\\" picture.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It does the basics. Current weather along with hourly forecast, 36 hou and 10 day outlooks.  I like the addition of the maps, but the radar map could use some tweeking to make it easier to use.  I like the addition of the traffic data as a layer on the maps. I use that for a quick view of the traffic to and from work.
B00005NC66|2.0|I rushed to see this when it came out in 1961 and adored it.  Now I have to wonder why.  Yes, I'm aware that it was a stylistic breakthrough and that we should all offer homage to Godard for that.  But, as other reviewers here have said, that's not enough to make it great film.  Many other break-through films are still enjoyable today but this isn't one of them.  I was enamored of it because I was young and impressionable.  I soon followed in the steps of the Jean Seberg character and went to Paris, enrolled at the Sorbonne and smoked Gauloise.  Fortunately I stayed clear of the creepier types that poor Patricia fell for.  I guess the close shots, the overlapping dialogue and the fact that the characters were so casual about sex were part of the attraction for me---remember this was the very beginning of the 60's and I was from the Midwest, not far from Jean Seberg's home, actually.  (I knew someone who went to  church camp with her in Iowa.)  But, gee, this time around, the glamour of that lifestyle had long since tarnished.  I'm still vulnerable to anything French ----I just re-viewed and re-loved \\"Shoot the Piano Player\\" but this one failed to hold anything to interest me.  The petty thief who is supposed to be sexy....well he wasn't.  His habit of rubbing his mouth, a la Bogart, was just pretentious and stupid.  The conversation in her bedroom...was beyond the pale...We're supposed to find that kind of drivvel interesting?  Well....chacun a son gout...And there are many who will attempt to love this film because they are told that they should.  For those who really want good crime films of the time, search out the ones by Jean-Pierre Melville, who had a cameo in this one.  He loved amoral characters, dark Paris streets and big American cars, too, but somehow his films held together, have the substance that this one really lacks.  I continue to love other Nouvelle Vague Films of the era, especially those of Truffaut and Malle, both of whom have a humanism that Godard never had.
B004K8WPUQ|3.0|I do a lot of video production and finally bumped over to a DSLR rig, (canon 60d) and this seemed like a perfect complement since my me-66 is way too long and gets in the shot when I use a wide angle lense.  The mic itself is good and the things I like are the conveniently positioned indicator light and ability to adjust the gain, -10, 0, and +20.  What's annoying is the mount. Every time I pack it one or two of the bands comes off and I'm reattaching them. Besides that it's very sensitive to any knocks on the camera. I've even had it happen when I had the camera on sticks and did a quick Pan down. Which is unacceptable. I wish the offered the mic in a better mount or so that uou can get your own mount. Otherwise it's nice.
B001CDLATE|5.0|If you're not into more cerebral, visual methods of storytelling, Baraka is probably not for you. But if you ARE into visual storytelling and thought-provoking visuals, I think you will enjoy it. Heck, you might even enjoy it regardless. Many people do.<br /><br />The visuals are outstanding. The \\"HD\\" in this film looks more \\"HD\\" than your average blu-ray movie. The picture is so pristine and sharp it seems to transcend reality. The camera uses such deep focus that you can see everything at once - and everything is beautiful.<br /><br />Enjoy. In fact, keep enjoying. This is something you'll be watching more than once.

145162445X|5.0|\\"Universe From Nothing\\" is a thought-provoking book, detailing how science has went about discovering the origins of the universe.  Krauss' subject matter is derived from the observable experiments and Data supporting the theory that the universe was created due to the big bang, which itself arose out of a state of rapid quantum fluctuations - from nothing.    Along with educating the reader on how the rigorous testing of evidence supports the theory that the universe sprang from nothing, Krauss finds it of equal importance to educate the reader by clarifying what \\"nothing\\" really is and how the scientific understanding or usage of the term \\"nothing\\" is more informative than the Philosophers or Theologians semantic, hopelessly abstract and non applicable definition.  Since the theologian contributes nothing more than mere backpedaling the definition into obscurity, Krauss argues that the scientific understanding of nothingness indeed replaces the relevatory or imaginative proclamations with more useful operational efforts to describe \\"nothingness\\".    Early on, Krauss sets the tone for the reader to explore implications by scientific discoveries by providing the scientific ethos for furthering our understanding of nature;  1) Follow evidence wherever it leads, even if the conclusions are startling or unexpected  2) If one has a theory, one needs to be willing to try to prove it wrong as much as one tries to prove it right  3) The ultimate arbiter of truth is experiment.    Throughout the chapters the reader is taken through the steps of the last 100 years in how the idea the ideas of size and shape of our Universe has drastically changed through a push and pull of theoretical science either being confirmed or denied by the advancement of scientific observation and testing.  This fascinating tale evokes many of the centuries observational discoveries in Physics and cosmology such as Edward Hubble, who confirmed that the expansion of the universe wasn't only happeningbut in fact accelerating, disproving Einsteins formulation of a \\"static universe\\" -  Other profound discoveries are thrown into consideration such as the \\"CMBR\\" ( Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation ) which supported the theory of the \\"big bang\\", or of the methods of how Krauss and others took in calculating the shape of the universe - leading to other profound discoveries such as the concept of \\"dark matter\\" ( or dark energy\\" ).  These discoveries in turn lead to other startling discoveries of our universe. . .which leads the path to the the thesis of the book.  I found the this section always engaging with Krauss always employs different methods, facetious analogies or graphs in helping the layman understand how the other scientists came to their conclusions, always underlining his useful premise;  \\"The Universe is the way it is whether we like it or not\\".    The integrity of Krauss work is further demonstrated with Krauss mentioning how he was cautious with the first data that comes in, might not be representative of all the data, systematic errors that could affect the data. \\"Speculations are fine, especially if it promotes new avenues for experiment. Krauss further calls for composure and being conservative as possible when examining real data.  In the last chapters the reader finds a wonderful description of processes of how a universe could come from nothing.   Some of the conditions that conspired to produce the shape of the universe that it is today such as the process of Inflation, whereby the energy of empty space/nothing gets converted into the energy of something - Empty space, endowed with enough stored energy which dominates the expansion of the universe, effectively creating everything we see.  It was mind-bending to discover that what we know or perceive as \\"empty space\\", is an unstable boiling brew of virtual particles that \\"pop\\" in and out of existence.  This fluctuation of energy happens so quickly that only the indirect effects of virtual particles can be measured before a positron meets the first electron, coincidentally annihilating each other and thereby returning back into empty space.    Krauss details more on the scientific method by citing the \\"paragon of good science\\" as when scientists use models that can be tested and falsified. Instead of working with questions of \\"why\\" something works, the work and inquiry of the scientist is to frame these into \\"how\\" questions, which allows the production of new knowledge and understanding of the phenomena. \\"How\\" questions are thus differentiated from purely theological questions, which presume the answers up front.  Richard Dawkins is also featured in the afterward, contributing a shorthanded yet chatty recap, successfully solidifying concepts that perhaps the reader was only beginning to correctly conceptualize together with underlining the significance of Krauss' work in the face of Philosophica and/or Theologian myopia . . .  In all, I thoroughly enjoyed Krauss' narrative and his facetious nature in trying to relate this profound and convincing discussion to the reader interested in Science, or those who follow the developments and discoveries more closely.
0312641893|1.0|So I've been awaiting this book for a while now because the concept just was so intriguing. But I must say I was disappointed. I would have liked more character development, more depth to each character and better descriptions of certain people/events. Some characters felt very flat and cliche to me and right in the beginning I knew what was going to happen. I knew the turns the story was going to take. Sad day when you wait for a book and it falls flat on it's face.

B004W2UBYW|2.0|I thought this book was well put together, and held my interest reasonably well throughout. Insightful in ways I had not expected, including actual conversations & deal making stories. I was VERY disappointed to learn that I am unable to lend or give this ebook away (hence 2 stars).  The stupid thing about this is I've downloaded various FREE books from Amazon, but the only one I can't share is one that I paid for - this one.  Spend the small extra money on a paper copy, you can gift it or sell it later.  The eBook \\"sale\\" is nothing more than a one-time use license.  Amazon blames it on the publisher, and yes, there is fine print you can go look for, but it's amazing that the 'Lending' indicator is not even displayed when a book is \\"not lendable\\" - pretty sleezy indeed.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I am very happy with this product.  Case is well padded (thick) and the kindle rest nicely inside.  I have a sort of dusty rose color and it stands out from other stuff in the den so I can always find it easily.  I don't worry if someone sits a book on top of it, I know the cover will protect the screen.  I would recommend this product to others.  Lots of colors to choice from!
0920668372|5.0|This was always my 2 daughter's favorite book when they were little.  Once is now a mother, and the other is 16.  I purchased this book, along with a wall cling that says \\"Love you forever\\".  I wrote a personal note about each one with special memories of them.  It was an emotional time but very special.  Now I get a warm feeling inside knowing my granddaughters will be hearing this same story from their mom.  I recommend this book to everyone with children.  It was a great price and shipped quickly.

B000002U84|5.0|The first time I ever heard of Duran Duran was when some UHF channel ran a daily half-hour of cutting edge music videos (for 1981), and they constantly ran \\"Planet Earth.\\"  My niece and I used to laugh and I said, \\"You want to bet we never hear from these guys again?\\"  A year later, I was a senior in high school, and this song kept getting played on the radio, a funky little ditty with infectious basslines, murmurings about being \\"hungry like the wolf,\\" and somebody told me it was a new group called Duran Duran who did the song.  I was shell-shocked!  I wasn't entirely won over until I saw how well they performed on Saturday Night Live (Look for the installment with guest host Robert Guilluame), and rushed right out to buy Rio.  To say this album is a classic masterpiece from my youth is an understatement; contrary to the naysayers of the time, critics in particular, Rio has stood the test of time due to its outstanding quality, style, and downright addictively catchy new wave tinged dance pop.  These days a lot of the new wave artists have been reclassified as power pop, and Rio certainly fits into that mold exceptionally well.<br /><br />It is amazing that a group of five new romantics could take 70s rock influences such as David Bowie, Kraftwerk, their most obvious influence Avalon era Roxy Music, marry it with the disco and funk sensibilities of Chic, and come out with such an amazingly appealing sound.  Driven by John Taylor's phenomenally addictive bass lines, Nick Rhodes' superb skills on synthesizers, Roger Taylor's steady, strong drumwork, Andy Taylor's scorching guitar riffs, and Simon Le Bon's distinct vocals and poetry, there isn't worthy of dismissal here.  Set aside the fact that the \\"Fab Five\\" were considered throwaway pretty boys by the press and lots of Van Halen fans and really listen to this album.<br /><br />Not just stars of some of the best shot videos of the 80s, the band is brilliantly light and dark, innovative with their obvious influences, and this, their best album, is representative of true innovative talent.  You already know when you see that album cover designed by Patrick Nagel that their sophomore effort is something special, and from the moment \\"Rio,\\" a tribute to America--not a girl--you can't help really listening to the magical gelling of the groups components into one cohesive unit.  Like a well-oiled engine, the production by Colin Thurston is exceptionally clear and slick, and each track stands on its own as a veritable 9-track hit singles collection.  Consisting of disco and funk fueled rockers such as \\"My Own Way,\\" classic hit \\"Hungry Like the Wolf,\\" and \\"Hold Back the Rain,\\" then the catchy popisms of the title track and \\"Lonely in Your Nightmare,\\" there is already enough versatility to hold your attention.  Erotic, anthemic \\"Save a Prayer\\" featuring Nick Rhodes bender-enhanced synth riffs and Simon Le Bon's hopelessly moody romantic lyrics is undisputably classic.  \\"New Religion\\" is a funky, brooding social commentary, while \\"The Chauffeur\\" is a Hitchkock-ian piece that out-broods most any other number the group has ever recorded to date, complete with that plucky synth and those handclaps.  For me, by far and away, the best song on Rio is \\"Last Chance On the Stairway,\\" probably one of the best 80s pop songs I've ever had the pleasure of hearing.  Wonderful in every way, this is a tightly put together number without one component out of place.  What sends it over the top is Simon's dreamy, romantic lyric, a touch of marimba and, best of all, one of my favorite guitar solos of all time.  In fact, I think this is my favorite of all of Andy's solos.<br /><br />If you are a newcomer to Duran Duran and Rio in particular, congratulations and welcome from an old-timer!  You've just proven a lot of naysayers wrong in claiming they would never appeal years on down the line.  This is truly one of the best 80s releases you will ever lay down money for, and you've discovered for yourself what we knew all along.  Duran Duran weren't to be taken lightly, and they still aren't.  I hope you enjoy this album for years like so many of us here have, and pass it on.  There's no substitute for well-done music no matter what era it's from.weren't to be taken lightly, and they still aren't.

0385534639|5.0|I will admit that it took me a little while to get into this book.  I will also admit that on a few occasions, I had to flip back to the chapter title to remember where in time I was.  Having said that, by the time I realized that I was into the book, I also realized that I never wanted it to end.  When it did, I knew that the ending was right.  I have read so many books lately that felt incomplete.  This book, however, manages to take a very intricate plot ... I even hesitate to call it that as it is so much more ... and ties it up so completely that I felt happy for the characters I had become so close to.  A beautifully woven tapestry of magic and illusion; the pain and beauty of human relationships; and the balance between the reality we know and the hope and wonder of the dreams we long to make true; this book is worthy of the hype that preceded it and the top 10 lists it currently occupies.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|wow, a great looking, trippy app! fun at first glance. let's see how i use it later... i find it quite relaxing. i was not paid to make this annoucement that i give it 5 stars!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob is one heck of a book. It produces the best example of an unreliable narrator that I have ever read. That being the case, I found myself questioning everything. I loved the story and found it absolutely chilling. I mean, what would you do if Jacob was your son? How would you feel? Would you be like the dad--or the mom?<br /><br />I thought the secondary characters were very realistically written, as was the portrayal of the judicial system. You can certainly tell that the author has a deep background in the law. Admittedly, there were some places where the book bogged down a bit, but I think this was due to how deeply the dad's character went. It almost had to drag a bit and this didn't bother me.<br /><br />The only thing that did bother me about this book was the ending. I liked the way it ended, thoroughly chilled me again and could've been ripped straight from the headlines (the Natalie Halloway tragedy came to my mind), but I thought the ending, compared to the rest of the book was too quick and not as rich or complete as the rest of the book. It felt a little like the author had an anxious editor on his back saying finish already. I would've liked this part to have more in-depth. We certainly got to know the dad, unreliable and loyal as he is, why not the mom too? That's why I feel I can only give it 4 stars. In all other ways, this was a 5-star read for me.<br /><br />Overall, tremendous read, one I highly recommend to thriller/legal book fans. I will almost certainly sample other books by this guy. He tells a great story!

B002NZV68U|1.0|Let's face it: In life there is good-androgynous and bad androgynous. The funniest evocation of the difference is probably that classic skit from Saturday Night Live called \\"It's Pat!\\". Pat in this case was a character of the most creepy androgyny, in an almost genius direction, and very funny. It highlighted what most feel, and certainly also gay people, that there  are differences in styles of androgyny. I am someone who likes masculinity as a cultural trope and biological ethos, and I see the virtue in it, which is not always recognized in our somewhat feminized culture. But at the same time, I am not bothered nor do I dislike fem guys, and just consider it a variation, and often a witty and charming  and beautiful one. But the  character made of the central Willy Wonka figure in this remake of the original Willy Wonka is just bad-androgynous in every way,  and very creepy to boot. Unlike the original with Gene Wilder character,  who was quite  delightfully oddball in his masculine way.  In fact one of the reasons I think the movie was such a failure is that it was  simply quite impossible to imagine reasonable parents  leaving children with this character. There were some good points in the movie, but since this central weirdness was a bit anxiety- causing, it failed as entertainment. Ironically, one of Johnny Depp's other movies actually proves the point exactly. When he played that pirate in many movies, it would be hard to conjure a simultaneously  more masculine yet swishy character. He swished through every scene, and was very fem in many ways. And yet, whatever that button is, he did not push it for creepiness. By contrast Wonka in this one surely does.<br /><br />This makes me think also how jejune and unprofitable it is  to read too much into these movies. It is just entertainment, and the reason one theme or style is chosen is often very ad hoc, if the actual history of movie making is any guide. Of course they make mistakes sometimes in choosing. By contrast, I remember being in 7th grade in Catholic school, when our homework assignment for Social Studies was to write a kind of analysis of a movie we liked. One of the kids gave a presentation about the original Willy Wonka, and gave it a very Catholic interpretation. He said Willy Wonka was like a Christ-figure and the Oompa-Loopmas were like the Apostles. He even said that when they break open that giant  colorful toadstool and it flows out with liquid chocolate, that such was like almost a Eucharistic sacrament!! Well, obviously the nun who taught the class was pretty annoyed by this analysis. The silliness of it reminds me how taking mere entertainment with all its ad hoc effluvia and factoids as descriptors of some larger meaning precludes our ability to plumb real lines of meaning, and find the actual compass by which to hermeneutically analyze the essential entertainment ethos. That goes for an academic school environment or elsewhere.remember being in 7th grade in Catholic school, when our homework assignment for Social Studies was to write a kind of analysis of a movie we liked.

1451627289|5.0|I have been a King fan for 20 years and have read most of his books.  Some of which are my favorites (The Stand, Dark Tower).  I have to say this is one of his best and one of the best stores I have ever read.  Great writing, characters so real you think you knew them in real life, great twists and turns and a satisfying ending.  King seems to be finding his groove again which is awesome.  Can't wait for the next novel Mr. King.  This one was a real pleasure to read!
0679736646|5.0|This was the second Philip K. Dick book I've read - I love his writing and I'm eager to read more. He uses common science fiction elements, such as telepaths and cryonic suspension, but his writing makes them fresh. In this case, regular people can use special devices to communicate to people in cryonic suspension at special facilities. The experience of these people in \\"half-life\\" is a completely different sort of world which people in the \\"real world\\" can interact with. Dick uses this plot device to raise questions about reality and drive some interesting plot twists. I enjoy his writing because it makes you think, whether it be about consumerism or what is real; it is very entertaining; and while it is an \\"easy read\\", it is still well-written. When the world around the characters begins to slide back into time gradually with prop planes replacing jetliners and antique cars appearing, Dick describes it so well it's easy to get lost in that time. While the ending can be somewhat puzzling, it fits the story well with the sense of unreality prevalent through much of it. The quotes about ubik at the start of every chapter were both amusing and puzzling. In fact, I would say that's a fair assessment of the book as whole - amusing and (deliberately) puzzling.

145162445X|5.0|I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  Dr. Krauss succeeds at invoking that rare sense of awe and mystery that one only finds in nature... and only with the help of a brilliant teacher.  As soon as I finished A Universe From Nothing, I started reading it again.  Truly the best popular science book since \\"A Brief History Of Time\\".  It's short and sweet... and will make you feel like you really UNDERSTAND something about the universe around you.  And Dawkins is right to compare this book to Darwin's \\"Origin Of Species\\".  This is a once-in-a-generation eye-opener that will change how you think about \\"nothing\\".
B006VRZ5YM|1.0|This movie started out reasonably well up until the point where the women started having conversations.  Things along the line of \\"who does it doggy style?  Dogs don't even like it doggy style!\\" and \\"Who 69s?  That's something you do when you're 17 and want to get everything out of the way before your parents come back!\\"  What?  The whole numbers thing is a very tenuous plot idea too, and the whole film to me was about neurotic and repressed women.  Honestly, I didn't even watch the last twenty minutes as the script was just so laughable (not in the good way) that I went and boiled my own head instead.  For a decent rom com look up No Strings Attached.  Natalie Portman is fantastic in it, and it's far more sexually liberated than this rubbish.

But it's interesting to see high end chef work from another area of the country since most of the high end restaurant books I read are from California (Thomas Kellers') and the Alinea cookbook (Worked for Thomas Keller).  A little bit less intense with the special equipment which is nice, but does call for liquid nitrogen but at least tells you how to get it.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|This is my first review I have ever  posted but I thought that I should post on this anime. This is the best anime I have seen in a long time. This anime takes you on one Hell of an ADRENALIN ride from begin to end. The style in which it is drawn reminds Me of a lot of anime's like Aeon Flux, Heavy Metal, Akira. The storyline is amazing how it unfolds and is not just thrust right into your face with no time for all the individual characters stories like a lot of anime's these day's. If you have never watched any anime before or want to start an anime collection with. I would start it with this anime.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great has so many different versions to choose from and saving your place is easy what more can you want
B006E4QCXU|5.0|just loaded about 1/2 ago &amp; my 13 yr od, 4 yr old &amp; I like it. suprising how simple the app is &amp; it keeps all entertained for little while. Very happy it had a video to watch b4 I loaded cuz probably wouldnt have if it was just a pic. Only thing to make it perfect would b if there was a way to make it wallpaper
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is wonderful.  I have it as a widget on my home page to remind me daily.  The audio is awesome!
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|13 has shocked me! I cannot believe that Megadeth has finally put out a rock solid \\"complete\\" album since 1997's \\"Cryptic Writings\\" Every Megadeth album that has followed that one has either flat out sucked or at best been a 3 star effort, and thats being kind(the last release Endgame was decent) but \\"13\\" is a pleasurable mix of old and new school Megadeth without the \\"Crap\\" that went in between. There are many faces of Megadeth here, including some jams that are similar to some of the progressive material on the bands best album \\"Rust in Piece\\". Even with Thrash elements gone (dont expect anything like the first two albums) the band makes up for it by using plenty of heavy riffs, blistering solos, and plenty of double bass. Megadeth might not be the Megadeth of old and in my opinon Dave is still an Idiot, but 13 is a solid Heavy Metal effort from a band that I thought was pretty much washed up. Whts even better is most of us know that Rock and Roll and Metal have pretty much been dead both in music sales and of course in the pop music world (FM Radio) yet Megadeth which I believe are pushing late 40's come out with an explosive effort. Dont forget to check out the New Anthrax album also. That is the best one the band has done since Among the Living!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I'm not really what this app is supposed to do, but it sure is FUN! If you want something to kill time with, this is your app.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|If you actually take your time with this you can create some really cool looking designs.  Play around with the gravity settings, start off on the low end. I was not expecting this app to be this fun.<br />Thanks Scott
B004SGWYW4|5.0|The anime itself is something i like. The story is good. The art typical anime-ish style. The package itself is great!  Thumbs up!  Great service as well from amazon. Thanks! looking forward for future transactions. Cheers!
B005K17RU0|5.0|After looking thru a lot of apps that were avail for the Kindle Fire, I  found that this app was by far the best out there.
0817439390|5.0|Very useful information, that i didn't find in any other book. the way author try to explain the concepts using real life example is very useful for beginners. I would say every beginner should get this book to understand the basic concept of photography.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry birds I'm addicted. I recommend for extreme takers any time of the week. I love the blue birds the most
0312427999|5.0|If you want to understand the situation in Europe, America, and much of the rest of the world today, this is a must read. I also recommend it to economics students who have been indoctrinated into thinking Capitalism is \\"science\\", and that it has been proven to work. Klein disproves all claims that de-regulation and a completely \\"free\\" economy lead to prosperity for anyone but the super rich.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game till my head hurts. I'm addicted, and you will be too. I absolutely love it. yeah
