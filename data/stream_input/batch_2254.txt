B00AJLHUYO|2.0|Three things that make Sinister not so good: 1. Were they trying to save electricity? This is the darkest (and I mean literally) movie I've ever seen, no one turns on a light through the entire movie, instead they stumble through a dark house, making it impossible to see what's going on. 2. Bad dialog between Ethan and other actors. Pointless, over the top conversations go on and on. 3. It's just not scary. A couple of jolts, but scenes that are supposed to be terrifying come off almost laughable. Wanted to like it, but no - Try The Woman in Black for a better modern horror movie.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005LAIGP0 The Woman in Black (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray]]]
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Only those who played Shadows of the Colossus Sony Paystation 2 know how he is so wonderful. A classic game that everyone should have in their collection
B0015AARJI|5.0|Bueno como todos los productos de PS3, es necesario comprar mas de un control para poder jugar en equipo. Good
0887431461|5.0|This is an amazing workbook, all of the pages are full of color and soo many different activities to choose from! Well worth the money.
0984725113|4.0|This slim volume (75 pages) is well written and touches on all the main points I worry about when I think about how my son is going to make a living when he graduates. The authors make two main points: we ain't seen nothin' yet and computers plus human intelligence is, for the foreseeable future, superior to computers alone. The former point is that computer function is improving exponentially, and as computers increasingly program other computers, the advances we will see will make past advance seem minor. Scary and wonderful, I suppose. The latter point is that despite these cascading effects of computer improvement, computers are still best at preordained tasks in narrowly defined functions and that humans interacting with computers are superior to computers alone.<br />If I had one criticism, it would be that it doesn't get at all specific about what disruption we're likely to see in the next couple decades. So, it's not that useful in helping young people strategize about how to prepare or what to study.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I have always enjoyed this game and love that it was available as a free app on my Kindle Fire.  Fun to play, no problems.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I personally love these books they are my favorite and I've been reading them over and over so I can't wait till the house of hades comes out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A great read. Chapters felt episodic in nature with the back and forth of characters and scenarios. Author has great conceptual use of human life below the surface after planet's doomsday. Edge of your seat excitement and anxiously speed reading to find out what happens next! Thoroughly enjoyed this book!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a very good book.  The author concentrated on many points of view in early plantation life.  On one plantation there was an indentured servant, house slaves, field slaves, a plantation owner and his family, a cruel overseer, and an abusive tutor.  The sense of family amongst many of these groups was emphasized.
B00006LI4D|5.0|I'm not much a of trio format kind of guy for the long haul, meaning an entire album's worth of jazz trio recordings regardless of instrumental configuration, but this disc goes the distance.  Superb.  Very accessible.  Understated and restrained, but with no pretense towards those qualities.  The feeling of the work here is genuine.  Not an ounce of self-indulgence to be found.  Classic yet somehow very contemporary in its aesthetic.  It's just a really nice record that should be part of any Jazz collection.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game, thought provoking and wonderful effects. Liked that this game was longer than last one I played. Once I started the game, I didn`t want to put it down. :)<br /> Just wished it would download alittle faster.
B009M588K8|5.0|I haven't read the whole book as of yet but from what i've read it is a very interesting book.<br />thanks
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|The Walking Dead is one of the few series in my lifetime that I ever made sure to watch.  The last one for me was Seinfeld and to be able to download them to my Roku to catch up on when I do miss one is a great convenience.
0553381407|5.0|I had very abusive parents and didn't know how to fix myself. This book gave me the tools and showed me how to unpack all the ugly baggage I was still carrying around with me in my 30s. I healed my life almost 10 years ago now and every year has been better than the last ever since. I also learned to let go of the most toxic people in my life because of this book.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I did hear some concerns that this movie was overly violent, but in my opinion it is no more violent than any other Hollywood Film.  The acting was at par, but nothing special and the story was well laid out.  A decent movie to rent for an evening.
1439130833|4.0|ok - simplistic but awesome upper for everyday life - you learn the secret very quickly and its reinforced nicely.
B00AHGSVKS|4.0|Interesting story that uses many characters to tell a big story that never feels too complicated to casually enjoy. I didn't guess the ending. The story built well towards it without being obvious. And Like all good science fiction stories it raised many excellent moral questions about the effects of progress and the concept of destiny.<br /><br />My favorite metaphor is the technology gap between the aliens and the humans. Frequently Clarke says that they lost the will to strive in the face of the aliens staggering power. They knew that it was beyond their lifetimes of accomplishment and made their scientific efforts meaningless. I have often felt that way approaching new experiences and recognizing the full capability, resources, and history of others. It can feel disheartening merely replicated the progress of a much more &#34;advanced people&#34; while living in the wake of their &#34;miracles&#34;. And yet I disagree with Clark's pessimism. I know that there is something in me that makes me strive even though it often seems meaningless in the larger picture. I suspect that it is an embedded trait of mankind strongly tied to our inborn desire for survival. I strongly doubt that it could be wiped away.
B001EKP5FK|5.0|Prince of tides was the first movie I and my wife ever went to on a date. Back in the 90's.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|very cute and funny.  the price was reasonable my grandkids love it too! very entertaining and good family fun for relaxing
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book doesn't make me understand what it's like to have cancer. But it does make me understand that I will never know what it's like to have cancer. And believe it or not, this knowledge, along with innumerable other parts of this story, has provided me with insight that I formerly did not have; of life and of the universe. Read the book, then reread this review, and find its meaning. And remember, what may look like a pipe is not always a pipe.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a good game to play with my niece. We have a lot of fun. It is a great way for children to learn how to follow commands.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was awesome! It kept me of the edge of my seat. I loved it! Highly recommend it to all who love these kinds of books.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Loved this book. I could not stop reading. Amazing! Had an amazing plot and twist and turn. It was unpredictable and that's what I liked about  it. Great read!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I personally would recommend this book to everyone that is responsible enough or can handle it. There are some parts of the book that little eyes don't need to be reading, but other than that, it's my favorite book so far. If you excuse me, I will now go watch the movie:) CAN'T WAIT!!!!!
B0090SI42Y|1.0|This just might be the worst movie of all time. The action is poorly choreographed. The acting is contrived and forced. RZA should never touch a movie, TV, album ever again...He was just that awful. It's play on parody was so over the top...it was long, uncomfortable and sometimes agonizing to watch. Save. Your. Money. If it's on cable...change the channel.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game so much when every I play it I just can't stop playing.For all ages kids love the game subwaybsurfers.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I gauge a  good animated movie based on my son's attention span. He was playing with his toys in 15 minutes. This movie is typical \\"Adam Sandler trying too hard\\". The story is slow. The characters are forgettable. The singing is quite honestly...lame. But, the animation is beautiful, and some of the jokes were funny. I found myself looking for chores to do mid-movie. So a yawner...but there's worse movies than this.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I don't know how I missed this when it was on but never heard of it till the mentions on Big Bang Theory.  Then I got this T shirt for the wife that says: \\"...also, I can kill you with my brain\\" and did not know the origin of this quote.  Saw a few re-runs on science channel and was hooked.<br />Can't believe it was cancelled cause there are so few good shows on these days. Scifi meets old west with a wee bit of Chinese to boot.  Great show.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Brilliant blend of old school arcade graphics and the bold cgi of today's animated movies. John C, Sara Silverman (adorable) and Jane Lynch are delightful, with a tip of the hat Alan Trudyk as King Candy. My son is mesmerized by this movie...and admittedly...so am I. The beautiful colors, the cohesive, endearing storyline...really make this an absolute pleasure to watch. Sugar Rush is just delightful. Get it. Worth your dime and your time.
0670026638|5.0|A magnificent contemplation of the natures of knowing and being.<br /><br />Nuanced, spare, poetic, lyrical.<br /><br />Gently, Ozeki weaves zen Buddhism, quantum physics, agency and interconnectedness into a gripping and evocative meta-narrative. Characters are life-sized (not too big or small; big, small, same thing) and achingly real.<br /><br />It's funny, too.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|Yet another wonderful representation of Tolken's work. Visually stimulating at all times which makes the time fly by. Before you know it the movie is over.
1442362901|1.0|I'm tired of playing around with this, so I bought the book!<br />Apparently I have to spend a minimum of $149.00 if I want to hear this &#34;MP3-CD&#34; version!  Forget it!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I had played Cosmos on ipad and really enjoyed it.  I am so glad they have it for kindle.  Osmos has great music to chill to while you are playing the game.  You really have to use you brain and think.  It is like a puzzle that moves.  Even the colors of the game are pretty and relaxing.  Headphones and a dark room make playing this game all the better (at least for me).  I find it addicting to play also.
B008220C56|5.0|I've read the book many many years ago and I loved it - I have seen the movie with Vivien Leigh as Anna Karenina and loved it and at first watching this rather unorthodox rendering of this love drama with Keira Knightly was taken aback. I instantly enjoyed the cinematagrophy, the music, the ballet scenes but I initially didn' get drawn into the story emotionally. However, that changed midway through the movie and then I didn't want the movie to end.<br /><br />I can understand that not everyone feels the same way but to me it was just a most artistic version, beautifully acted and even more beautifully photographed. Am looking forward to watching it again and again!
0307719774|4.0|I was not expecting it to be the smaller size it was. It's about 6&#34; tall, bit less than 4 1/2&#34; wide, and 1 1/4&#34; thick. The amount to write is also small, not ideal for those with bigger hand writing styles....four  3 1/4&#34; lines per entry, five entries a page. Beside my awncers, I like to put the day of the week, and early on I wrote them down months ahead of time. Sadly, I marked Feb 29th (given for leap year, witch it is not) and now I'm scribbling out 3months worth. Completely my fault. Has some wear on the corners, though trying to keep it to a minimum. How it will hold up in the next couple of years, I'm not sure... Over all a neat book, some good questions, and some bad, but I love it.
0425263916|4.0|The story picks up immediately after the first book ended. The same formula works here with the back and forth and Eva attempting to self-therapize the relationship. We get as confused as Eva when Gideon seems to break up with her. Has he really taken up with his ex-fiance at the expense of the only woman he claims to have loved?
B0000X61UU|5.0|I had this workout video as a VHS for 10+ years, and it finally lost its sound. I missed it so much that I just had to purchase the Dvd. I've been using it and loving it since I received it.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|I've been a Peter Pan fan since childhood. When it became available on blue-ray I had to add it to my collection, replacing my other copies.
B00338QENI|5.0|It's so sad that it's the truth of how things were (and may still be). God bless the Lacks family, and those others that must be out there. And God Bless Rebecca Skloot for writing this!! Telling this amazing tale. Doing the HUGE amount of work that it must have taken to get this book in print. Is there a movie coming?? Should be.
B005DN5BE4|4.0|My nephew needed to view this movie for school and write a report on it. Thank you for having it available for this purpose. He really enjoyed the movie.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|For years I have been told to get this book.  Finally...finally, with the ease of the Kindle (I DO so love all actual &#34;real&#34; books), however, in this day and age of instant gratification, The Kindle rocks.  &#34;Oh&#34;, I say to myself, &#34;I really, really HAVE to get this book, &#34;On Writing&#34;, by Stephen King. Mind you, I am not a King fan. Not that I don't recognize the greatness of him (cuz I do), but I don't like scary stuff. That being said, I am also in the midst of &#34;11-22-63&#34;. Gripping!!!! I broke from that because of my life-long yearning to write is EVER present in my mind, heart & soul. NOW. I just got fired from my job, so guess what? I have time to finish reading this book (although I sort of don't want it to end) and can continue with &#34;11-22-63&#34; and WRITE. I already have written stories (pretty good ones I think) that need editing, draft-work etc...And I realize that I have SO very many more. The ideas are flying into my head faster than I can even keep up. I need to begin a list...Keep jotting the story ideas down, before I forget. I have many &#34;fossils&#34; Steve. Thank you for your inspiration! Thanks for writing this book! I SO should have gotten it the many years ago when urged to, numerous times. I guess that just means, the time is NOW.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|This movie exceeded my expectations. I saw it in the movie theater and was eager to have my own home copy.
B005IQZB14|5.0|The writing sensation that is Cheryl Strayed...Wow. I found her first on The Rumpus.net. Her column was/is compelling, compassionate, inspiring, beautiful. Unfortunately, I was a day late (& a dollar short) as she had stopped contributing at the time. Oh I was wishing she were still there. I still wish she were still there. I missed that boat. But I read every dang one of those columns and all of her beautiful, sweet loving advice to the heart broken who had reached out to her. I love how she says: &#34;Write like a Mother-f-er&#34; on her column. I want the mug. Through the Rumpus I found her book. AMAZING & BRAVE & couldn't put it down. Have turned so many peeps onto the book. And her other books. My life is in turmoil (hugely at this moment), but I know it's all for my best. I have just been granted the precious gift of TIME to write (got fired yesterday!).I then found she was doing a seminar in Petaluma, CA. Wanted to go to that. WAS going. May still. Then I found she was at Esalen Institute. I called to book it. I knew it was my destiny to be there for the writing workshop with her & Pam Houston (another fave). NOPE. Boo, hoo. Long since sold out. 50+ peeps on the wait list. I added my name. Not that I can fly from SW Florida to CA on a moments notice. Damn. Esalen...looks, must be, IS amazing from what I can see. My soul needs it so badly, it almost makes me cry. So, I still may attend Petaluma (1 day seminar) and STILL may make it to Esalen for a different writing workshop. Cheryl Strayed rocks. To anyone attending her Esalen workshop, know that MANY (I'm sure) are jealous!!!!! But happy for you to get to be there. Wasn't my destiny, but the other will prove to be. Hopefully.
B0012GMW7A|5.0|I began listening to Leonard Cohen in college and decided to renew my collection. I really like this CD of his.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Oh the horrors of the holocaust and World War II.  Amazing tale.  LOVED IT!! If my mother were alive, she'd have eaten this one up, as she did all things about the evil that existed for the Jewish people. Congrats on the success of this book. I could so relate to Leisel for wanting those books so badly. In fact, I'm just admitting this out loud, and on the internet, but in my youth, I too stole a book or two. I HAD to have them. A very poignant, beautifully written tale. Thank you!
B009VYF5E2|4.0|I have been watching &#34;Merlin&#34; from the first. Being a lover of King Arthur and Camelot, I have enjoyed this new take on the story.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My Granddaughter loves it.  She is a big fan of Angry Bird and watches all of the videos she can.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This movie is spectacular!  I was really eager to receive my copy since I missed it in theaters. I will definitely be watching it more than once.
B002IW8V0E|5.0|love this gift set version !  I now have the movie and the cd !  The music makes me happy and the actors are sublime !  so glad u had this available for me to purchase !
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This product was horribly designed. It is very slow and at times just clicks off without notice. I would never ever get an app from this app builder again.
B008I3RARW|2.0|Well I am just glad I got it free and dud not have to pay fir it very basic.  Sorta boring not my favorite
B00BHMF578|3.0|Well made movie, nice attention to detail, but it didn't quite click for me. The tension didn't really build, characters weren't deeply developed?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This battery app is amazing because it tells me the battery percentage. But it also lets you customize the batteries color so it also makes it fun. That is why I love this app.EVERYONE NEEDS THIS APP
B0063GORYU|4.0|almost as easy to use as my PC version, but harder to win!  Will definitely play it more on my Kindle
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I love Rick's books. I've read all the Percy Jackson books. This book is equally amazing. The book is extremely compelling. It will keep you tuned in. I read the book in two days. I highly recommend this book if you enjoy the books of Rick Riordan.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I did not catch Fringe on a regular basis until season 3, so am enjoying the basic building blocks of the saga in season 1. Can't wait to move on to 2. And I have not yet seen the final season, so it is a constant challenge to avoid peeking ahead.
B00899F0G8|5.0|This an amazing show I think it was amazing :) :) :) :)I loved it so much that it was so worth it:) :)
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book should be read and followed by everyone.  It's time we got a handle on what has and is happening to what we eat.  Big Food has got us and its time to set ourselves free from the garbage that they call &#34;healthy grains&#34;.  Our grains today are the furtherest thing from healthy and a major cause of many of our popular and exploding diseases.<br /> Dr. Davis is right in with what he writes.  I have been following his advice for a month and never felt better...losing inches, losing joint pain, losing all cravings for junk, finding wonderful wheat-free recipes, more energy, clear head and the list goes on.<br />There are a few physicians out there that have got the picture of where we are headed based on what we are eating and it is not pretty.<br />  I also recommend &#34;The Blood Sugar Solution&#34; by Dr. Mark Hyman.  The information provided by theses physicians and others of the same mind, could change entire industries.  It's time we took our health back from &#34;Big Food&#34;, &#34;Big Pharm&#34;, and our government who is the benefactor of these two industries and others like them.<br />I highly recommend this book, especially if you want your health back.<br /> Jude Carmona
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first because my boyfriend forced me to and fell in love with the movie but i decided to read the book for its amazing detail, i feel like i lived the entire story. Beautifully written, amazing detail just goes beyond expectations!
B0031QVW2U|5.0|As others have noted, kind of spendy but when added to the Black Rapid RS-7 with the sliding locks fastened I can bend over and the Brad strap keeps the RS-7 from sliding on my shoulder and keeps the camera safely by my hip.  Listed at 26 inches, mine actually adjusts out to 22 inches, but still plenty for larger shooters.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As usual the acting was excellent and the plot lines had sufficient twists and surprises to keep the viewer on edge.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|My short review is that I like the story, but it is pretty predictable, which I find happen a lot once you get use to an authors writing style.  It did throw in one twist that I did not see coming with the former spouse.  I won't say more than that, so I don't spoil it for anybody.  I did like that it wasn't the traditional love story that NS writes, it does have some suspense to it...which is why I gave it 4 stars verses 3.<br /><br />It is a quick read for anybody who needs a nice beach read or weekend escape.
0694003611|5.0|Both my kids had a copy of this book and we used it to instill bedtime.  I put a picture of them in the back so I said Goodnight to them at the end.  Tradition continues as I buy this for people who have babies and explain the process of using it to say Goodnight to their children.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It was a happy movie in spite of the underlying sadness. Another tribute to the human spirit.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|It's been a long time since \\"The View From The Hill\\" and Justin Hayward proves he's still a forceful talent. On first listen, it seems that this is a grand collection of mid-tempo love songs and you might be right. However, Hayward simply takes his best quality of songwriting and refines sit. \\"In Your Blue Eyes\\", \\"One Day, Someday\\", \\"The Western Sky\\" and \\"The Eastern Sun\\" all showcase strong songwriting ability with interplay of guitars, keyboards and orchestration. The heartfelt emotion is both subtle and in your face. Nobody plays the 12-string like Justin Hayward.<br /><br />On further listens, there is strong evidence of `bluegrass' which shouldn't be surprising, as three of the albums songs were recorded and produced in Nashville (\\"What Your Resist Persists\\", \\"Broken Dream\\" and \\"It's Cold Outside your Heart\\"). In fact, Kenny Loggins lends a hand in songwriting, vocals and guitar on \\"On The Road To Love\\". Also, \\"Its Cold Outside Your Heart\\" is from the album, \\"Moody Bluegrass Two...Much Love\\". These make a nice blend and mix with the standard romanticism of Justin Hayward's typical songs. Another nice fact is that Alberto Parodi co-produced this album. He's been helping the Moody Blues since 1967!<br /><br />Not to miss a surprise, at the end of the alternate version of, \\"One Day, Someday\\", Hayward interjects a short bridge of an instrumental to be followed what can only be called Techno Euro-pop. But that's not a bad thing when you give it a good hard headphone listen. No need to dance to these two remixes of \\"Out There Somewhere\\" (from \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\\"). The first version puts a spin on ethereal vocals and keyboard work, while the second places more of an emphasis on percussion.  It's like getting a little extra boost after a full album. The view from the hill changes still.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved it!  Tons of feeling and mystery in beautifully written descriptive prose - characters and period really came alive.  I didn't want the story to end.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I've been playing for a couple of weeks and I cant seem to put it down.  So far the best game for my kindle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome especially when you are bored and have nothing to do.also when you have kids and always asking for your phone
B0091VGAXK|5.0|It is so much fun to relive the big screen. I thought the movie was so much fun. Great Music and very funny...
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book held my interest right up to the shocking end. I would definitely recommend this book to all! GREAT!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Great music...lots of fun to listen to. Takes me back to the days of Big Hair...and not just the girls :0
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A friend showed me this game and I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire. I absoluetly love it . It is a great game but I could become addicted to it. Very challenging!!!
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|I liked the book but some of the sentences did not make sense. All in all, it was a good book.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Not the best movie ever but I love the cast so I'm giving it five stars.  It was funny and the cast was funny and mocking each other, I love that they all use each other's famous lines.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This is his best original material since \\"Devils and Dust\\".  There are many great, and I mean great, songs (Rocky Ground, We Take Care of Our Own, Shackled and Drawn, Jack of all trades, etc), but the title track towers above the rest, a defiant call out to that would tear us all down (age, fear, complacence).  Springsteen can come off too self-aware, too self-important, but these are minor issues that crop up on the edges.  I defy anyone to name an artist this vital, this potent...40 YEARS into a recording career.  And when he indicates he is tired of burying his life-long partners and friends and at the same time shouts his defiance in the face of the abyss...I say amen.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Florence and the Machine is perfect!  This is the best artist and I adore her songs. i would recommend every cd she makes
B00881VLCE|2.0|It seems to not want to open after I close out of it. It's frustrating. I keep having to delete it then reinstall it. Is anyone else having this problem? Is it because I'm using a kindle?
B009329ZF2|4.0|Again I went in with low expectations but I do secretly love the cast!!!  Thank you for putting them all together and found that I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again and recommend it!@  Aliens, Hot guys, beautiful girl, death, destruction, blowing things up, wounded worriers, what else can you ask for?
B00BHUB11Y|2.0|Love this movie, but the first time my son watched it, it froze 4 times, had to be restarted and was blury. Not the quality I normally get from Amazon. I checked to see if it was my internet connection, but everything was fine. It was the movie. I hope it's not this troublesome the next time.
B0088TG252|3.0|This was not one of my favorites but it was ok. I like the cast but I wasn't in love with this movie.  I would probably watch it again but I don't know if I would rent it, I'd probably wait until it was on tv.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|xoxo, this was a wonderful way to end the series.  Blair and Chuck are together at last!  And what a shocker to find out who Gossip Girl was!
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I usually love the Resident Evil series but this is time I will never get back after having watched this movie.  Now I can say I see why they should stop making movies after 3.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is a very great game you have to learn to have hand eye contact with the device and also my children love it it is a very fun game to compete with the family I love this game
B008VBYN80|4.0|Graphics are very good, game play is intuitive and for a free game with optional purchased content. I have been able to really enjoy the game without spending a dime.
B0031RS7MW|5.0|Love reading books by this Author .<br />Characters come alive even village life springs up. Enjoyed the different people within the community some welcomed and some like Gypsies not.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Excellent book that gives a very insightful look into Steve Jobs and the history of Apple.  His management style doesn't  seem like it would work in most places, but it sure worked for him at Apple and Pixar.
0140177396|5.0|I really liked this novel Of Mice and Men, which takes place during the Great Depression. The author, John Steinbeck describes about California working farm, which is full of natural environment.  This is a wonderful classic novel. The story is an excitement, enjoyable, emotional and shocking, and it is easy to read. The story shows the true climax and realistic of the world. The main characters are George and Lennie, who are migrants and good friends.  I liked their friendship and dream too much, but I was sad in the end of story.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have Bern a fan of Stephen King since grade school. I have read everything he has written at least 3 times, and although The Stand will be my forever #1 favorite read forever, 11/22/63 is definitely in my top 10 King books. Buy this book. I promise you will not be disappointed!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's a good read, but not one of those books you can't put down.  It;s more of a love story.
B008AYA7WE|3.0|Since I play this with my kindle fire hd, I thought it was close to the old Tetris. What I didn't like is since you do have to move and think fast , the blocks can flip while I'm trying to move them across the screen. This causes them not to stack tightly and once they start moving fast there's not enough time to correct. Still fun.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a well written and edited book.  I really liked the story line and characters.  The pace was very good and I cannot wait to read more by Hugh Howey.

B00AWFEBDK|5.0|All of Jared Diamond's books are thoroughly rigorous in their content and accuracy. His research, scientific method and conclusions always make for good reliable reading. As a senior Biology secondary school teacher, I use his material to enthuse and enthrall my students and personally I enjoy the professional development he can offer me....Well done Jared
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved it.  Read it when it was first published.  Read it again and still my favorite.  If you haven't read you are in for a treat
B009X01C64|2.0|This case was everything I wanted until the color from the inside strap stained my ArmorSuit screen protector.  Marware told me this is an occasional issue with their case if you don't use a Marware screen protector.  Marware offered to sell their protectors at a discount but I don't want Marware screen protectors so this case is going into the trash.  Very disappointing.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|It does what it says it does... let you download YouTube videos to your device.  4 stars, because its not as intuitive to figure out how to actually use it.

In this age of seemingly polarizing positions without much hope of unity, Doris Kearns Goodwin takes you on a remarkable journey into the life of President Lincoln and his cabinet that came together during the most trying event this young country had faced.  This well written book takes you into a time where the needs of the many were above the wants of the few.

1609611543|5.0|I was recently diagnosed with Celiac's and began a gluten-free diet before reading this book- if you are too, don't let that stop you from buying/reading, it's still well worth it and will grant you more than a few 'Aha-moment's' through-out. I can't say enough really...I am an avid self food-researcher and I have read many books geared toward knowing about what really goes into my body i.e. Omnivore's dilemma, Skinny bitch, Food Inc, Fast food nation and so on, all of which I would recommend, but this book...will startle you.<br /><br />Get it, read it, share it...and let me assure you, going GF is not as hard or sustainable as it sounds. I can truly attest to the fact that after some withdrawal for a short time, you will not miss these toxic foods and you will be amazed at how much less you eat in general. It's a life change absolutely worth making and I'm so, so glad I've read it before children as I know these dietary practices will ensure a better life for them.

B0000073NC|5.0|Somehow the first few Scorpions Cd's were never part of my collection. I now consider this album to be an absolute must for any rock/metal fan. You can hear how these guys must have had an influence on future Rush. As other reviews have stated this is a psychedelic  hard rock masterpiece no doubt about it. The last song is probably now may favorite Scorpions song ever recorded. I used to think that the pinnacle of Scorpions was Blackout and Love at First Sting but I think I'm changing my position now. Lonesome Crow and Fly to the Rainbow are so stunning and historically powerful they must be recognized as some of the greatest music ever recorded by the Scorpions!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Read these books. You won't regret it. I started reading the book and yes they are a little confusing at first with all the characters but once you get into them.... Wow! Great books. (I think the show is a good cliff notes of the books)

B003MC5N28|5.0|What an interesting book.  It is wonderfully written and the story is a really page turner.  It was given to me by my professor who taught young adult fiction but I still found it a great read.
0205313426|5.0|A great little book. A classic that should be in every writer's library as well as students' libraries (Is this a correct sentence?)
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Not bad.......I liked it considerably. It was entertaining. It was informative, but could have included more weapons. Would have been nice.
1599290634|5.0|quality stock, quality printing,  great illustrations,  inspiring art,  very little words,  the perfect book for the creative artist that wants to break into the business or just have thier imagination take off
B00BESM14U|5.0|\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is possibly one of the best movies I have seen in awhile. This movie deals with what seems like the typical story of a boy transitioning from middle to high school, where he experiences new friendships, crushes, drugs, alcohol, and bullying, but really, this movie digs so much deeper by addressing suicide, loneliness, abuse, peer pressure, sexuality, rape, guilt, depression, mental and emotional breakdowns/blackouts....etc. I was not expecting this movie to be so good, but it truly is. Admittedly, I found myself crying towards the end because of how well this movie connects to the audience by addressing almost any aspect of a teenager's life, in the best and worst of cases. But most importantly, this movie does strongly embody the message of \\"it does get better.\\" I highly recommend this as a must see. Though it may seem depressing at first, this movie will leave you feeling better about yourself in so many ways. I commend this phenomenal cast for doing such an outstanding job and I am truly amazed at how well done this film is.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|I had to purchase this film because of its historical legacy and because I am a film fanatic. The storytelling is revolutionary and continues to impact modern directors today, such as Steven Speilberg, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, and all the mega directors of our time. Japanese cinema itself is a great world for outsiders to take a look at.
B006CHML4I|4.0|The Seiko 5 automatic watch is a good every day watch for an active person. The watch has stopped on me twice since receiving it: because I guess I just didn't move my arms enough. Over all the watch is Ok and seems to keep correct time as long as you're an active person.
0385349947|5.0|I recommend that this book be provided to high school students- both male and female.  This book is inspiring and  empowering.  I hope Sheryl publishes more books in the future.<br />As a working woman,  I do fear that I am seen as uncommitted to my job when  I take off from work to take my child to the doctor or just take some time off to care for my health.  I think my male boss is understanding that  as a person I have multiple responsibilities, but one never knows.  So, thanks to wifi,  I can make up the work from home late at night by giving up some sleep hours.  We  are living in exciting times where women are independent and can make a difference.  It's weird that women are naturally seen as nurturing and caring, but no one wants a female boss --  I too, get nervous when a female manager gives me a project.  But I do the best that I can..  Thank you for this book, and I hope you do well at Facebook.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|My only problem is that one you jump you have to wait until you land before you can slide on the ground. You should be able to go into a slide from mid jump, is very frustrating because sometimes you try and slide but it does a jump instead and there is no going back so you die because the thought jump instead of slide. Other than that I really like the addition of the diamonds!&yen;&euro;&reg;

0765325950|1.0|Totally agree with reviewer who wrote that the best thing about Memory of Light is that it represents the end of a series so bloated, over long and past its prime that it's not really even worth commenting upon -- except to say hallelujah! that's done! And good riddance to a number of silly characters and preposterous situations.  The best scene in the book, in fact the only scene that gave a bit of a frisson, was Egwene's sacrifice.  If only other characters had emulated her action. A huge let down on every level, so many key characters practically ignored, so many extraneous characters front and center, could barely slog thru it until the end. Sanderson's good start when he picked up the series (eliminating, for example, all the spanking, sniffing, skirt smoothing, endless & pointless costume detail, etc.) was discarded as he tried (was forced, no doubt) to include almost every character who every made an appearance, including some mentioned in passing and those with little interest for fans (or the central story line).  Couldn't even remember who the Sharans were (still not sure but don't care)though they ended up being a HUGE part of the storyline.  Sigh....can only hope not, but rightly fear, that poor Georeg RR Martin is well set on the same path with Song of Ice and Fire's last book -- it contained all the plot meandering, limited action and padding that Robert Jordan perfected, and Sanderson was left to sweep up. But inasmuch as this book, and many of the others in the series, belong in the dustbin, suppose that's only fair. The only AWESOME (gad, that word) thing about this book and series is that so many readers could give it five stars -- unbelievable. (whew -- I feel better.)

0061673730|5.0|Prisig takes us on the same philosophical journey travelled by many big thinkers in philosophy during the second half of the twentieth century.  The journey is a trip into the cracks in modern Western epistemology, an espitemology which was the foundation of modern Western confidence and certainty in things such as progress and perfection of science.  Many modern philosophers sensed the weaknesses inherent in modern Western philosophical ideologies and set about pulling them appart: Heidegger,  Foucault, Derrida, Habermas, Taylor, Kuhn.  One can find echos of all their ideas in Prisig. What sets Prisig appart from the rest is that he takes the journey on a motorcycle, which makes it much more fun to read. I found his story particularly fun to read because I too went down that road and like Prisig committed academic career suicide by trying to solve unsolvable philosophical problems. ( I failed my Phd at Oxford, and while I did not end up in a looney bin, I now run a cabinet shop, and agree with Prisig that getting your hands dirty in the physical world is theraputic. Today younge people of Maker movement are waking up from a computer induced trance to rediscover the same thing).  One can quible about the details of Prisig's philosophical conclusions but I think that is beside the point. I don't think his conclusions are any less tennable than many of his contemporaries. At least motorcyles is a better escape from the malaise of modernity than Nazism (Heidegger), or  endlessly wordy obfuscation (Derrida). The book is a great and fun introduction to the big philosophical issues of the twentieth century.  Some of the issues may be less relevant today because the world has changed so fast in 30 years, but from a historical perspective this is still a philosophical classic.

Action driven from the opening scene to the very end there is never a dull moment.  Daniel Craig may be best Bond in a long line of Bonds (with respects to Sean Connery).  Definitely a &#34;must add&#34; to any Bond collectionl.

On page 3, someone had written that at the end of the book, you find out that this is not really a video game but Ender is actually fighting the real battle against the enemy.

B008Y6QZ56|5.0|This movie does something amazing that I've never seen pulled off before, it allows you to both root for and against every character. All the main characters are underdogs fighting for justice but also jerks who used other people to get what they wanted. You may think you know who you're rooting for then you find out something terrible that made that person the warrior you cheer for in & out of the ring.  In end the movie is about fighting to make yourself a better person whether you've made bad choices, had bad luck, or did the right thing only to get knocked down.  You don't have to be a fighting fan to like this heart warming movie about family. Could be the best movie ever
B001L5YW9I|4.0|This movie, to me, is almost a classic. Daniel-Day-Lewis is fantastic; it's a drama so we can expect sad things happening but is still a &#34;must&#34; see.

B005KAH7QU|4.0|The CIA embarking on an amoral plan to bring into the world a set of super-operatives.  But things go drastically wrong, and the sole surviving members go live their lives in the wilderness until it is time to set the world aright!<br /><br />This movie has it all:  intrigue; action; crazed criminals in the employ of a rogue CIA operative; an unsuspecting English family traveling in North Africa and Spain; a young girl who has seemingly memorized an encyclopedia and can fend off a small army on her own, but is entirely without social grace; her loving, deadly adoptive father; and the woman who killed Hanna's mother and wants to destroy her, too.  And don't forget the ever-growing body count!<br /><br />It is an odd premise, and there are some odd characters and quirky situations.  It is, however, an interesting tale, and you can get a feel for the puzzlement Hanna feels as she learns about the world beyond her forest home. . .but somebody needs to teach that kid about hair conditioner!!!
B009HUB40Y|3.0|I love match 3 games, so I though this would be fun. The pieces look like they are going to explode, constantly vibrating. My eyes couldn't take it, and I couldn't concentrate to see the matches in the time alotted. Would have loved to continue to p,ay, but the pieces need to just be on the board and not moving.

B00846F1YW|4.0|This is a great hidden object game. It's not so hard you acn't find anything, but it's not so easy that you get bored. Down,oaded when it was faotd, and really glad I did.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love the alarm clock it's so cool now I can wake up early to eat chips and hang and chill while listening to my hip music ok that's my opinion  u welcome
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great mix of hidden object and puzzles. The puzzles aren't so hard they seem unsolvable. I loved the story line as well. Definitely recommended!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read! Cheap kindle price helped a lot too, but I would have paid more for it! Great book! -
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I loved this book! I learned some new things and literally laughed out loud a fair amount. That being said, I'm a feminist who doesn't take herself too seriously, I don't have a problem with profanity, and the occasional instance of T.M.I. doesn't scare me.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Normally I don't go in for journal style storytelling, but I couldn't put this book down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the update is really cool and has fixed bugs that made me stop play one local games but, I hope they add more things from the Pc to the p.e. version like redstone
B0094K1QR8|3.0|I watched the entire movie, but only because I was bored.  There wasn't much to hold your attention, no interesting storyline, dialogue, etc.  I love Kevin Cline and was disappointed by his limited time.  Actually, I enjoyed the rest of the cast more than the stars.  Would I pay to watch this movie or buy the DVD?  Absolutely not.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is so easy to play and it is awesome. I'm a dragon lover so I play this along with dragon story. wish it were easier to visit other players though.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I really didn't like the dictionary that came with the Fire so decided to try this. This is exactly what I was looking for. Very easy for a tech novice like me to use.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this app it is.so fun for a dragon lover like me. id say my fave dragon is the final form firetorm dragon. I have the second form and cant wqlait to evolve it again. I recommend this app to everyone.<br />Ps add me id AislynnSommers
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Bad adaptation of the classic tale. Poor costumes and sets did not do justice to Imperial Russia. Transition between scenes was choppy. Do not know what the director was trying portray using the the play-like transition between scenes. Horrible movie!!!
B00466HM28|5.0|I have enjoyed so far learning how to use and perform on this midi keyboard. My expectatives were fullfilled and hope i can become a an expert on it
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|For those boring minutes waiting somewhere<br />or in the office.... awesome time killer<br />It is verry challengng and yet improving with time
B003QS9WIE|1.0|I had the TV turned all the way up and still couldn't make out what most of the actors were saying especially Michael Caine, very muffled voice. I had seen it years ago on DVD which was fine but Amazon needs to work on their audio.<br /><br />The movie is great but the way Amazon provides it here is very lacking.
B0051HNMTI|4.0|I have the paid and the free version.<br />No difference indeed so dont waste your money on it get the free one
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Tired of space shoot em up fiction then try this book. A big surprise as it is both intellectual and exciting and very well written.
B00846WWVM|4.0|It is fun game but there are some small things that need to be improved, like accuracy and all. With few improvements will be perfect game
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Still a good book.  Lauren Oliver's writing has improved since the first two books, but it's not amazing prose.<br /><br />*** soft spoiler below ***<br />The ending made me wonder about other cities in the U.S.  Sure, Portland, Maine, fell but what about New York City?
B0086221SS|2.0|The plot line is  too thin, and  minimalist.  I am surprised that such a pallid product has such goo actors.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|A fun game that you will continue to play to upgrade vehicles and power upgrades. If you play you will enjoy it.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I didn't watch Lost when it was on TV and began renting it..I only watched the 1st disc with 4 episodes on it and knew I had to buy the complete series..the writers and producers of the show are brilliant and keep the audience coming back for more..I love this show !
B00181JGI2|1.0|This is NOT the film I ordered.  This is a reproduction of the film made in the early or mid-90s.  The original one didn't have the foul language this one Did.<br /><br />I wish I could return it and get a refund!<br /><br />Lee Ayers
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Well written.  I have read enough sad, violent sick stories.  I think from now on, I am going to start reading more upbeat stories, fun, laughter, and healthy outcomes.  Thank you for making this my last &#34;sick people&#34; story...
B00BHNR1KQ|2.0|I found the movie to be very slow as far as action and I found it hard to even finish watching.<br />It did not scare me or anyone watching with me.<br />It really leaves you wanting something to happen that never dose until the very end.<br />Even at the end it leaves you wondering why you even rented it.<br />All the best parts are in the trailer and if you watched it be for renting it you saw all the good stuff you will see..<br />A lose of time and money on this one is what I think about it.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|When I first this game I thought it was amazing and fun....and one of the best parts is,you get to save you fun and creative styles to your sd card
B009NQKXYK|5.0|I love scifi movies and this one is in the top 10 for me.<br />It's cool and very well made I find the movie hard to beat in the scifi lineup of today.<br />I hope they make Prometheus II soon and start where this one ended..<br />This is worth watching or ordering to have for future use...
B000HGA5PM|4.0|Just the fact that you own this rare piece of Floyd history. The packaging was very nice. The wall live 1980 is a must have for a real Pink Floyd lover.
B007CUPFEC|4.0|I like the movie but I found parts 1 and 2 better with more action.<br />Part 3 just dose not have the same feel and it's lacking something..<br />I have seen part 4 and I like it better than part 3 as well.<br />Overall I don't feel it was that bad but it could have been better...
B002BY77CW|5.0|I love Lauren Conrad and respect her a lot. Enjoyed the book a lot, and already ready to read the next one.  I did try to figure out what characters where from \\"The Hills\\" and see if it was any stories from there. It didn't matter, I really enjoyed it and again really admire Lauren so it was worth it.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I'm training for my 3rd ultra and needed a little motivation. Scott is certainly an amazing runner and must have such a strong mind being able to push through like he does. Makes me want to forget all the excuses and just run.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked the book, the idea behind it is definitely new and interesting. But the ending left me a little skeptical, it is probably ok for a novel, but in real life I don't think it would happen.
1449410243|5.0|This is an amazing and hilarious book where you can identify a lot of situations with your cat.<br /><br />What I didn't know is that most of them had a different meaning.<br /><br />Not I sleep with an eye open!<br /><br />A must guide for cat lovers.
1400067820|4.0|Mr. Taleb went into seclusion to write Antifragile, and emerged absent his sedatives.  The degree of disrespect towards some individuals, generally in the field of economics and journalism is astounding and uncalled for, even if criticism is deserved.<br /><br />\\"The mere mention of the names of Thomas Friedman or Paul Krugman can lead to explosive bouts of unrequited anger on my part.\\" pg. 342<br /><br />Even college courses are not spared:  \\"college course in the charlatanic subject of Financial Economics\\".  pg. 78<br /><br />On Historians:  \\"History is truly written by losers with time on their hands and a protected academic position.\\" pg. 220<br /><br />On the OMB:  \\"scam artists of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.\\"  pg. 68<br /><br />On professionals (in Finance/Journalism?):  Career professionals are to knowledge what prostitutes are to love. pg. 331<br /><br />The last time Mr. Taleb was on \\"GPS\\" with Fareed Zakaria in December, 2012, he was piped in solo via satellite.  It will be interesting to see if he'll be a guest among others in future shows, especially after his less than flattering words for the likes of Paul Krugman, Thomas Friedman, basically all Nobel laureates and other regulars on GPS.<br /><br />Now let's turn to some of the uncompromising arguments presented in the book:<br /><br />Mr. Taleb is highly critical of science and academics, especially in the area of health care.  He views the body's natural healing power as superior to what health technology offers even today.  He asserts reducing the number of smokers surpasses the impact of all scientific advances in health care combined.  Mr. Taleb puts too much faith in nature and evolution.  Much unnecessary suffering is endured by the sub-optimal design of the human anatomy as described by Gary Marcus in [[ASIN:B002ECETZY Kluge: The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind]].  Evolution is a painfully slow process that lends itself well to piling new systems on top of old ones like patchwork.  The superior system is one with orchestrated intervention rather than pure natural selection; scratch the haphazard evolutionary process every once in a while and build anew using all accumulated knowledge.  For example, the human spine is a remnant of our ancestor's quadruped era (walking on all fours).  Since a few million years ago when we began to walk upright, our single line of vertebrae has been ill prepared to support our entire weight.  Consequently, lower back pain is experienced rampantly by over 90% of humans over a lifetime, a malady that would virtually disappear with a properly supported skeleton; 4 pillars of vertebrae optimized for bipedalism.<br /><br />Mr. Taleb detests entities that are antifragile at the expense of others' fragility, e.g. large banks and financial institutions that reap the rewards of risk taking and suffer little of the downside. I find that notion to be confusing because every living organism would fall under this category to a certain extent.  If you're breathing, it's because a cow somewhere was slaughtered for your survival benefit , or an egg never hatched to give a chick a chance at life.  Perhaps a certain threshold can be envisioned, past which an entity or person becomes excessively predatory?<br /><br />While Mr. Taleb is correct that in the long haul many fragile systems will either be eliminated or become robust and eventually antifragile, much suffering can and should be eased or eliminated where possible at the expense of delaying that eventuality, and perhaps with a softer landing.<br /><br />Mr. Taleb is an advocate of \\"less is more\\", and it would have been delightful to apply this idea to \\"Antifragile\\" to present a more focused content.  Alas, this book could have greatly benefited from further editing, but Mr. Taleb is too free-spirited and independent to allow his work to be meddled with.  Many of his ideas, however, are novel and with some endurance, the book is well worth the read if one can look past the insults and some arguments that are clearly on the fringe.
B009LDMJBU|5.0|This time he's really done it. Such a great album and completely up to date musically.<br />Adding the guest vocalist works well. The songs grow on you each time you listen to them more.<br />I loved this album. More please.
0446547573|1.0|Who are the over 3,000 people who gave this terrible book 5 stars?  I love to read.  I will read just about anything.  However, I will never read my second Sparks book.  Try Elizabeth Berg if you want a fast good read.  Or Anne Tyler.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|A great movie and one of the best Westerns ever. Who can go wrong with Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne and Lee Marvin, with Ford directing?<br /><br />However, Amazon says it was released in 1969. I probably saw it 20 times BEFORE 1969, and that was before video. IMDB says 1962.
B00957T6X6|1.0|I bought the five book collection after watch the first season of the TV program for Christmas. I gave this book series a poor review not because the author is a bad writer-he is in fact a great story teller. The problem is is that he is a terrible story ENDER. After 338 chapters (not counting prefaces and epilogues) the story is as confused, tangled and disjointed as ever. I found the first three books to be great-solid, entertaining and engaging. At the end of those books I was left wanting more. I was truly surprised by what had happened and was truly looking forward to see how it all came out. But the end of book 4 I was not quite sure I would see and end. Book 5 is a disaster. I would say it was a train wreck-but a train wreck actually comes to an end. Yes, when it is over, the train wreck has a lot of wreckage but it stops. This book does't stop it just keeps dragging on. Even the characters beg for mercy. Out of 71-yes, 71 chapters in book 5, at least 50 of them are just meaningless filler. Sure sin many the plot does move forward-but it does so in a line or two and the end of the chapter. Most of the chapters just drone on and on and on giving endless lists of names of people who may or may not be important, too numerous flashbacks and too much fretting by the characters about doing something. In several chapters it was torture: \\"I am going to take some action he said boldly. But, really should I, he asked? He took another step. Am I really doing the right thing he asked silently? He took another step. Maybe this whole thing is a mistake and we will all die, he whined to himself\\"...ad infinitum. At one point I though an apt analogy of the book was that of the endless snow storm that engulfs everyone and everything. Like the snow, this book covers the reader and the plot with billions of words that tend to obscure everything. But then I got to the end of the book where he quickly wraps up the book in a few chapters that have a lot of incongruous actions that left me totally confused and disappointed as to where the hell this guy is going. Of course, the problem is that I believe, he doesn't really know that himself. THe true analogy of this book series is that of the sweater that has a bunch of loose threads. You pull them all and the sweater falls apart. True, you still have all of the loose threads but the sweater is no more. The only truly enjoyable part of the book series is that of the story of Arya. In these chapters, he is back to tight writing, good stories and real movement in the plot line. Unfortunately, out of 71 chapters she shows up twice. I am not entirely sure I will bother with the next two! I mean two more! Maybe in a year or two when they come out I will be more interested-but I will want to look them over carefully first.....left me totally confused and disappointed as to where the hell this guy is going.

1475143389|1.0|This book is full of old myths and flaws regarding nutrition and strength training. I'm not gonna bother listing everything I found, but in almost every chapter I jut shaked my head in disbelif as this book is bro science and not backed by studies or science.<br /><br />Check out Martin Berkhan on leangains.com and starting strength by Rippetoe instead.

B009LXEBD4|5.0|My girlfriend is a huge Kelly Clarkson fan, and though she already owns most of KC's albums, this was still a welcome gift. It helps that I got it during a stupidly cheap Black Friday special, but the unreleased songs, as well as the lovely Christmas song, make this a must-own for any fan.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love Cooking Dash. It' s easy to play and fun too!! When I need to escape from a hard day, I turn to Cooking Dash. My kids love it too!! In a world where kids are exposed to violent games, it' s nice to know there are games like this that are fun and non- violent.
1577314808|5.0|Eckhart Tolle has changed the way I think. I have the ability to relax where it was impossible before. I have bought aproximately 15 (&#34;The Power of Now&#34; and &#34;A New Earth&#34; by Eckhart Tolle also) books and share them with or give them to my friends in hope that they too will benefit as I have. I have read both books 3 plus times and am still understanding more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have immensely enjoyed following the well-developed characters in series and the storyline. When it was over, I found I actually missed them. It's like closing a book when you are done and missing your &#34;friends.&#34;

B008XG1X18|5.0|Be very careful as Pinterest has become the new black hole that you-tube used to be.  There is no looking up something quickly as you will get pulled in until your Kindle runs out of batteries.  Your brain will be so full of new projects that you will not be able to pin down which one you will do first.  I won't even comment on how amazing the history tab is.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Like the original Stargate Series, this doesn't let the Stargate aficionado down. The same thrill and excitement exist as well as a certain chemistry that has come to be expected in all shows associated with the original Stragate.

B00AA7O6QC|2.0|-1 star for the plot line, -1 star for the dialog, -1 for the cheese call backs, & 5 stars for the action scenes. Packs a punch with fire power and action but you'll choke on the hammy catch phrases. Overall it's about what you'd expect.
0240815807|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend when he was just getting into recording audio. He LOVED this book. It's full of great, practical information for the audio enthusiast and it definitely helped amp up his expertise while we were recording bands at home. Would highly recommend this book for anyone needing more information getting started.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|These guys are the next big thing. I had the PRIVILEGE of catching them live at SXSW and they were second to no one. Great live set, thought provoking, relatable lyrics, unpredictable and exciting each and every song. If you haven't heard of them yet, don't worry you will. So why waste time?  Buy their albums now and go see them live if you can. For starters &#34;Car Radio&#34; is your best bet. But you'll love them all. They get stuck in my head all the time and half the time I can't figure out which one is in playing in there because they all dance in my brain simultaneously.
0553573403|5.0|Definitely a great read. I got totally sucked in, and I'm halfway through the series now. It's not as raunchy as the HBO series, and it focuses slightly less on heads getting chopped off and blood squirting everywhere. So if you didn't like these aspects of the show, the books are an improvement.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good game. this game is fun and creative. It is informational. And is great for kids I recimend you to play this game
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie... I watched it  movie hall, and now I have this DVD, so that I can watch it anytime.<br />Highly recommended!
B0055B7IPE|4.0|Starts with a gloomy reflection on life and dreams vs reality and ends with a typical cookie-cutter happy end, I liked it
B008MM9630|4.0|I like that this game can be played off or online. I just started playing  but, so far so good. Vibrant colors and the music isn't annoying. I recommend this game to anyone that likes to play farming games.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|What Can I say. . .it's Bruno Mars! Great combinations of ballads, doo-waps, Reggae, etc. And most of them are wonderful sing-a-longs!!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham creates a humorous setting in the opening chapters of this book.  I found myself laughing out loud at his main characters and their antics.  Things sobered up quickly as they went to trial.  The trial outcome was not surprising, but there were redeeming outcomes for some. The lawyer jargon got to be a bit much at times, but i plowed through anyway.
B0084HJE0S|5.0|This book offers an exciting little peak into the future of html5/js! A good book to whet anyone's interest in this new platform.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started reading I wasn't sure if i would like it because the main characters are teenagers.  Well i didn't like it I loved it.  So moving.  Couldn't put it down.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this story.. just as I have every book from Nicholas Sparks.  I would recommend this book. The story is magical.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Remember this is a comic adaptation.  And it has a lot of tongue in cheek dialoge.  It has everything I love in a movie... Comedy,  action, SCI-FI, and good special effects.  Yes there are plot holes, and yes its cheesy... but its a movie about a norse god.... of course its cheesy.  Me an the family enjoyed it.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is really good I love this game and I think you should install this in your iPad,kindle,phone etc. Really great game!!!! :)

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I had not read anything by this author but will again.  She kept you wondering all through the book and showed life is not always what it seems and even good endings are questionable.
B000JML90Y|5.0|I reas this book years ago when I was in school...it's even more relevant today. This is a must-read for any free thinking person!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I just got this game for $6.00 less than the regular price of 6.99!!! I played it and it was the best game!!! If you don't get it right now you are missing out big-time!!!
B00846WWVM|5.0|I LOVE this game!!!!!  I'm not one to review apps but I'm absolutely hooked. I hate to admit it was 2:30 before I realized I'd totally missed my bedtime!!  That's how obsessed I'd become in reaching my next goal!  This is a fun game with awesome graphics, cute characters and I don't even mind the background music which is  usually annoying.  LOVE IT!!!!&#34;
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|Even though I liked &#34;Sense And Sensibility&#34; better, this one has excellent lines like these:<br /><br />&#34;My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of the clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;You are mistaken,&#34; said he gently &#34;that is not good company; that is the best.&#34;<br /><br />And more, but I'm too tired to list them all. I also enjoy the good and the best company.<br /><br />I love, too, that the two main characters still love one another, even after so many years apart. It is unfortunate that Anne was badly advised in the first place and let herself be persuaded to give up Capt. Wentworth.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I hadn't realized how much I'd missed Downton until I saw Season 3 was available. Of course I mainlined the whole season in one weekend, and what a happy chappy I was until it ended. Epic series this!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Now time for the next one!!!<br />My sister in law recommended these books to me and so I decided to read them. I am so ready to see the movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I eally like it.  Can be anywhere and check weather where I want to go.  Thanks for having it available for my Kindle Fire HD.<br />Love this Kindle.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I cannot think why or how this has never got to be a movie.  I can see Robin Williams, Mandy Patimkin, any number of great people in it.  Without giving away the story, the book mostly concerns an angel from Paradise and a demon from Hell, both of whom have to report back to their main offices on what they manage to accomplish on Earth through the ages; they have come to know each other and become friends to an extent, and now the final Apocalypse is announced and they are expected to make their stands. As well, there are all sort of subplots involving humans -- including a wonderful cast of wacky characters.  Pratchett's wonder Death makes his appearance, and I can't say enough about this book except to go get a copy -- it will amuse you at the very least, and make you think about your situation at its very best!
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|I bought this product so I could do mobile podcasts without looking like a complete idiot. I have a Zoom H4n recorder that I use to record with I bought a mono 1/4inch adapter so I could connect the Atr-3350 and my Droid into the 1 & 2 inputs, and make phone calls during the podcast.<br />The sound quality is very decent for the price. My H4n has very good noise cancellation software, and cleans out any noise the 3350 might give out. The problem is if I'm in a noisy place, it's difficult for the 3350 to pick up my voice clearly. I've had to amplify my voice in post a lot, which makes it sound amplified and inconsistent. I'm sure there are people who have more sound tech knowledge who would be better at it, but not me.<br />Indoors, it works great; even outdoors at a coffee shop. But I've recorded a couple podcast episodes on the subway in LA with my H4n, and I really like how the sound. I tried that with the 3550, and it was terrible in comparison.<br />If there was a 2 1/2 star rating, I would give it that. It's about halfway to what I need.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|The book involved swallowing so many unbelievable coincidences, untruths, ridiculous salvos, etc., that although I have not seen the movie, I cannot imagine it stays true to the book.  It is like eating a large meal and then a hour later being hungry all over again.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I liked this one even better than I did Iron Man.  Great acting, excellent charcaters.  The Hulk makes the movie.
1439130833|5.0|Received the item on time. Very thrilled to have this book. Would certainly recommend to a friend. Love it love love it.
B002SM2QDC|3.0|Nice action movie.  First time I really saw Mr. Channing in a leading role.  Interesting how the story doesn't follow the comic all that well.
B007FGPZTS|3.0|I love The Smiths and Morrissey has an amazing voice. This is the perfect &#34;rainy day&#34; album.<br />Unfortunately, I was sent a scratched album that I immediately returned. The replacement album I was sent is also scratched and warped. Amazingly enough, it plays just fine. I am guessing scratches are an issue that began @ pressing, so the next one sent would probably have the same issues.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was a very sweet woman's read... predictable but a nice romance... very interested in how the movie compares which is ultimately why I decided to read this to begin with.
B001NI24OI|4.0|I watched this film after having watched all five seasons of the television series it inspired. The film is a beautiful tone-poem of a movie, filmed in a verite style that makes it seem as though you were eavesdropping on conversations or spying on character interactions. This is a great male-dominated football movie, whereas the television series was more balanced, had better character development, and was about much more than football. In the film, aside from cheerleaders shown doing flips, women are practically nonexistent. The wonderful Connie Britton is utterly neglected as the coach's wife. In the TV show, she's a rich, complex character with her own story. Here, she is hardly more than a trophy wife, silent but supportive from the sidelines. That's a shame. It might be unfair to compare this film to the series, but the series is such a triumph that it's hard not to. Billy Bob Thornton is great in the movie, but he's no Kyle Chandler (as Coach Taylor in the series). I would suggest watching this movie before watching the TV series -- but definitely watch the series, no matter what. It's fantastic.
B001VIMCW4|1.0|just one action sequence after another. got boring very fast. watched it for about 30 minutes. a waste of good actors.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game can be fun, but can be difficult to gain extras.  I can't wait to be an accomplished driver.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|evermore solves lots of my problems.  I never lose track of important things that I need to keep up with now.
B0046ZG2VG|1.0|I ordered this and was really excited to use it! I opened it up and put the cartridge in the camera. I took a picture of my cat and the picture came out and I did everything the instructions said, like covering it and letting it develop in darkness. My picture came out white with a little black outline of the cat. I kept the picture because it looks creepy. I was VERY DISSATISFIED with this product. I will NOT be buying this ever again. Waste of $8 ($3 for product and $5 for shipping)
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Guudd I finished a goodwill thought out book there is also a play to this you. Should go and see it sometime
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't seem to stop watching. At the end of each episode I have to watch just one more. I know I am addicted
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's another way to keep in touch with friends and relatives that I don't often see.  I especially like our family page.  On the negative side, fb makes a lot  of unnecessary changes, and it's not always easy to learn the new changes.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Addicting to say the least, if only i had a 24&#34; tablet to play it on ;) Then i would be set!
B00005KAQP|5.0|Sister Act is great ! I luckily saw it in the theatre three times. Kept taking people to it so I could enjoy it all over again. Loved the girl group stuff of the plot. And what else can you say about Maggie Smith. Superb as the Mother Superior. But Whoopi in her best role ties it all together. I'm sure Disney was suprised but thrilled they had such a hit on their hands. Spawned an equally good sequel and now a Broadway musical. You can watch this gem with anybody. Very highly reccommended.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. It is absolutely amazing...I can post all my photos in one place for all my friends and others to see.
6305433909|5.0|For once a sequel that is equally as good as the original. Disney hit paydirt again with Whoopi Goldberg  and Maggie Smith reprising their roles. The very funny Michael Jeter adds his part and it is hilarious. Luckily I saw this in the theatre. Whoopi still has the girl group song thing going that I just love. Reccommend thia film to anybody.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I enjoy this game, however I got the free full version with ads. The ads keep popping up all the time so you spend a lot of time returning to the game. Very distracting. Other than that hassle the game does have some challenges which make it interesting to play.
B001N1DPDE|2.0|Honestly, I can't see what is so fantastic about this knife. Ok, it is probably indestructible given the exaggerated thickness of the blade, but it feels too heavy for general use, unless you use it for splitting wood. I never needed to split the wood to make it burn, so I can survive without that. The sheath locks the knife too hard, making it necessary to use both hands to get the knife out of it. You can try to do it with just one hand, but when you hold the knife and push the sheath with your thumb, the sheath will kind of split in two parts for a moment and bite your finger! Despite the fact the knife is firmly locked on the sheath, you have to use the snap on button, otherwise it will shake and turn upside down as you walk...<br />Hope this can help other customers to make the right decision.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Enjoyable but not spellbinding.  Easy to put down to do something else but fun to read.  I recommend it for vacation or airline reading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is definetly the BEST game for free of the decade!!! The creators of this game were so smatt as to have the game upgraded to different terrains. I HIGHLY recommend this game for all ages, young or old. But be warned. This game is Addicting!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! there's a bit to do, sometimes it gets kind of boring but it helps the time pass! perfect for younger kids!
B004EI2NM2|1.0|Appears to be a copy that has been cut or edited down as to size and clairity and content, over.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Classic solitaire with winning &amp; random deal options.  You can choose single or 3 card draws.  Great options and easy to use.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|fun, the kids love it. great game if you like puzzles. there are so many ads that it interfers with options for kids make.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was prepared, but this book still broke my heart.<br /><br />This is the book I wanted Looking for Alaska to be. It had some similarities, the same story in some ways, but... so much more. I Love Hazel, I love Gus, two characters that might at any point slip off the page and live in our world (cancer free!!).
B002RSQGQK|5.0|Oh my!  I LOVED this movie!!!  I promise, you will too--so just go buy yourself a copy--now!  Jimmy Stewart plays a wheelchair bound slouth that is trying to solve what he thinks was a murder.  Awesome film.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I've read a lot of good books lately, but none come anywhere remotely close to The Book Thief. This book has tunneled its own special place in my heart and there it will stay.<br />I recomend this book to... anyone.
B00004TJKI|5.0|Do not miss this amazing film, one of the true thrillers of ALL times.  Besides, who would want to miss Jimmy Stewart in this great film that solves a difficult murder case?  Also, definitely go see Harvey and Rear Window, too!
0345803493|3.0|I enjoyed parts of this book, it's better written than people give it credit for. But it was a bit long... I was bored for a couple stretches. And the plot was very close to the Twilight series, and a bit over emotional which gave me a couple eye rolls of my own.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|Ah, the remastered quality of this collection will make you smile--although the silly plot twists will make you giggle and wish you'd never watched the more recent incarnations of Star Trek.  Appreciate the old, then watch the best of the Star Trek Series: The Next Generation.
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|There's a lot of overlap from other prevailing UF and PNR series (I guess that can't really be helped). Besides the fact I felt like I was rereading several of my (favorite) books, this book was thoroughly enjoyable. Worth a read, definitely.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I thought I'd miss Jason Bourne, but we loved this version and really grew to like the main character.  Give it a try.  Here's hoping they have more !!!
B00280LYHS|4.0|I think I wouldn't have been as disappointed if I hadn't expected this book to be the best of the series.<br />As always I love Rick Riordan's style...but the LAST OLYMPIAN was less creative than it's predecessors.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is fun to play. And helps to calm my nerves. I play at night when I am trying to relax before bedtime.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|So... I was confused. I thought A Dance With Dragons was the last book in the series for... like... 90% of the book. So I spent most of this book royally pissed off that nothing was resolving the way I hoped it would. Then I read a blurb or review or something that said... 2 more to come.<br />Yay!<br />So, I guess what I mean to say is that this book was a fantastic chapter in the series, it just didn't resolve anything
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Immediately got me hooked. BBC is brilliant. Quality of video is very good. Subtitles were not in sync (a bit fast).
B003MC5N28|4.0|I read a lot of horror and dark fantasy...blood and guts and zombies, but there is something to be said for subtlety... and  fantastic writing. Chilling. Beautiful. Scary, real.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|this is an extremely good version of temple run. i love this game. why couldn`t they bring this out sooner? .
B000FC13MM|4.0|I really like this book, it is beautifully written, imaginative and descriptive. I recomend this book to anyone who likes dark high-fantasy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome temple run well I think you can use power ups it's great if u like temple run this is for you it really gets you in the mood for playing this :)
0765356139|5.0|This book is a 'well, what happens after?' book. I'll tell you what happens after: absolute brilliance. I loved the book more than the first. This book was definitely on level with song of ice and fire, just with a bit more... Dare I say it?... Optimism.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This Is a great game because it has multiple games inside of one game and it gives you a chance to explore the options so yes this game is very good and it is very impressive
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Wait... wait a minute... Who stole my epilogue?<br /><br />You want me to eat rocks? Well, let me tell you that rocks might be more satisfying than that ending.<br /><br />Fantastically written book, beautiful imagery, real seeming characters with sparking chemistry and then...
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry birds is fun but frustrating.  I have been wasting a lot of time but I do enjoy the game.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|This book was sweet and even though it followed a basic over-told and over-rewritten story, it had a true spark of originality. Cinderella story aside it was still utterly predictable. But i shed a couple tears, laughed out loud and all in all had great fun reading this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is way to epic! I can't even describe the game! It is completely and absolutley the best to date!
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I had a hard time at first with this book.... As in I dropped it twice about a third of the way through. But I'm so glad I stuck it out this time! Fantastic book! Brandon Sanderson is a much better writer than Robert Jordan. he might even be as great as George rr Martin, but much cleaner.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|and it is as close to right as weather predictions ever are.  The number of words deters me from writing reviews.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|This is the kind of book that makes me wish I could break the five star limit just to elevate it to a class of its own.
B004XNGKBS|1.0|This app not only works poorly but automatically creates an account without permission and apparently stores my personal notes on  a remote server.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I've been playing this game for at least 4 months now without any issues. Just recently, after the update, the game freezes up constantly. It's so bad that the game is now unplayable. It's unresponsive &amp; force closes all the time. I even tried changing the settings (which i didn't have to do before) &amp; it's still horrible. Please fix!!
B005N09L5C|2.0|This is the  dreariest,  most unhopeful  movie I  have  ever  seen.  Meant  as a  condemnation  of  collectivism,  it  simply  goes  too  far  and  becomes  painful to watch.  By  the  end,  the viewer will  feel  like  he  or  she  spent a  month  in  the  gulag.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|Fun game if you like civilization type games it's very addictive but the product is geared towards making you buy stars so you don't lose your hard earned and created units. before you know it you'll spend lots of money.  Parents do not download this game for kids as there is no way to turn off the purchase features in the game. similar to zanga poker but 100x worse because the game is designed for you to accidently click items in game so you use your purchased stars then you are forced to purchase more. I really feel like this game is a scam to force you to keep paying.  This could be a great game but for all the reasons above it's really been ruined.<br /><br />My advice don't even get started with this game your just hate yourself later.
B0009F2EPU|4.0|I was thinking Hans Hotter, as well, but McIntyre was no slouch and I found him more than acceptable in the role.<br /><br />This Ring is one I bought some time ago and saved it: After all, one can only first experience something once. I was very taken with Siegmund and Sieglinde, and wish heartily she had been doing Brunnhilde,a role she had not performed at the time. The biggest flaw was Jones who did nothing but caterwaul and, as well, was underpitch.<br /><br />Very taken with Manfred Jung, I found little about him, and that was written auf Deutsch... born in 1940, he was thirty-six for this performance. Sadly, I found he sang Mime on his only other recording (so far as I know). I thought he was really, really good, enough to satisfy my misplaced desire for Melchior with the fabulous voice, but a handful of other (forgivable} flaws. What always strikes me in more current Rings is the difficulty of digging in and moving about. Good heavens! Stand-and-sing is long gone; and while I'm glad of that, one has to be an athlete for some of the stagings in many of today's performances.<br /><br />I have only three Ring videos and a goodly number of CDs (my favorite is the Furtwaengler with the Italian orchestra, and I thought it was only I who loved that recording, surprised when a number of persons on this forum had the same idea.<br /><br />My favorite video for the staging is the Met's (Jerusalem was sick and Behrens was past it). Oddly, I like The Copenhagen Ring, although it's singers are all but useless, but the acting was good. Yeah, I know: It's opera, so who cares about the acting? It has much to recommend it if you're not hide-bound with tradiation or imprinted with the best performance you've ever experienced. Now I'm going to see if I can find another Ring video, one can never have too many good to great performances of anything.<br /><br />And whilst I'm here, if the latest met Ring is on video, I shall be the last person to buy it. Voigt alone turns me off; just another caterwauler, which proves just how difficult - impossible - it is to find Wagnerians of any stripe. Having said that, I have Gerald Finley's Sachs and I'm saving that, as well. I'm flat-out crazy about Gerald Finley: His Argante alone...just another caterwauler, which proves just how difficult - impossible - it is to find Wagnerians of any stripe.

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|A pretty good match 3 of the &quot;make matches on top of these tiles&quot; type.  Could use a bit more story tho.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All I can say is I need the next one....NOW!!<br />It has my undivided attention for sure... I think I'll take vacation from work to read...
B00992CF6W|2.0|Not worth your time, not even close to real XBOX version. Maybe if it was free, do not waste money on this
B00AREIAI8|5.0|AWESOME GAME......I would not recommend for children who can't read. Other than that I think it is a great way to teach a child how much care a horse requires. &amp; How much it cost to have one.
B00BHMF578|5.0|If you like a movie filled with humor and intrigue, that just happens to be based on a true story, you should probably watch this movie.  It is superbly done.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Got it for my 3-year-old, and she loves it,  but I think I love it more. I have to play it after she goes to bed, though, or she'll nag me. The soundtrack is great, the coasters are fun, and the physics is accurate. The crashes are hilarious.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game, really addictive (good thing!). I love that you have to complete the missions so that you get a higher multiplier. GREAT GAME!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Headset has great surround sound. Was well worth the price and was easy to setup. Has worked great for the last 4 months.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Strong case for an afterlife.  The doctors credentials made his account believable.  Made me want to explore other books of this type.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It was challenging but it was also very fun. I played it with my 14 year old daughter and 49 year old husband and they both found it very interesting.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This book may  have too much history detail for most readers.  At times the number of characters was overwhelming.  I found the everyday lives of the Welch coal miners the most memorable.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|not that good. should have done it in foreign language with subtitles. better feel. sorry rza. that's all i have to say.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is one thing I find easy to navigate on a Kindle I am still learning my way around . It takes a little more effort to respond than a PC but otherwise I like it.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|good graphics, fun to play. not having to pay to play is nice. I enjoy the cartoon feel, seems reminiscent of Mario Kart 64
B0096HL33G|2.0|This wasn't what I was expecting.  I didn't get the impression this was a chick flick by reading the description.
1451695195|1.0|This book was not what I expected and would not recommend it to anyone.  It was not very interesting and not even<br />believable. I expected more after seeing how others rated it.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I am sure it is a great game but it wont install and to high of a price you could probably find a better app like this
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I bought this movie because I loved it so much. It's out of the ordinary and hilarious. Do yourself a favor and get one too. You'll love it!
B0074MZSWW|1.0|The sound quality of this CD leaves something to be desired.  All the songs sound somewhat the same and I couldn't even listen to it all the way through one time.
B0001O3YD0|5.0|I love Vin Diesel. I would watch nearly anything he's in. This is a great movie and keeps you glued to the TV the whole time. I promise you'll love it.
B009O07NMA|5.0|There is not one song on this entire cd that I don't just crank up when I'm driving a round
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I loved all the Twilight books. I read every one of them and now I'm happy to see this movie. You can't watch it just once. I'm sure you'll love it.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|...I really don't get it. Why the studio insists NOT releasing the extended edition together with the theatrical so that the customer can CHOOSE in equal terms ?<br /> The answer is if they do this then the theatrical dvd will sell NONE COPIES cause all fanatic LOTR fans will want to buy the extended edition with more footage and scenes in the movie which is natural.<br /> Do u have money to burn ? buy this dvd or better yet give it to the POOR...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|O M G this is the best book I've ever read. I laughed, I cried- I loved it! Must read!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There's some really awesome moments in this season. Some really good action, too. The actor who plays the Governor does an outstanding job.
B00942X8PY|1.0|glad I did not pay for this one.  It tells you it is loaded but it is not.  Took a while to download.
B00821OX98|5.0|If you are into the post apocalyptic scenes, the addition of aliens into the mix adds for good entertainment.<br />I was hooked, with the availability of amazon prime streaming season 1 and 2, I spent nearly all weekend watching the show.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Fun to play.  My husband downloaded this game.  The grand kids love to play it.  I enjoy it too.  Fun to play on phone, kindle etc.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Lots going on & had a great ending, if Bates was not in jail. The interactions are fascinating to watch.
B004SRNH10|1.0|Does not work.  Won't open.  Have apps that say you have to have this app too but it does not work.  If you require this for another app to work just delete the app.
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|A timeless film in its historical lesson. This is a film I see at least three times a year, and I always enjoy it, especially because there is always some (changing) aspect of the film that is particularly pertinent to the current events of the times. The plot, the art direction, the script, the acting, the music, the costumes, the cars, are just stunning. For those who enjoy themes and film weekends, I would pair this film with &#34;Who Framed Roger Rabbit?&#34;, &#34;LA Confidential&#34;, and &#34;Crash&#34;.
B00999VI0Y|5.0|After purchasing a different bluetooth receiver for my Bose Sounddock Series ii that didn't work, I was a little skeptical.  After attaching this to my Sounddock and turning on the bluetooth connection on my iPhone and iPad (not at the same time), this little baby connected to both devices with no trouble at all.  The sound coming through the Sounddock was clear, with no static, and no breaking-up signal.  I am so glad that this one worked!  I also connected it to my MacBook Pro, and the Sounddock is playing crystal clear as I'm typing this review!  I would highly recommend this product to others.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Boy this DVD was a HUGE eyeopener into what is being done to our food by our government or at the very least supported by our government.  How sad they treat animals the way they do and we get to eat the foods they created, we are all guinea pigs.  They don't care until one of their family members gets sick and dies.  Everyone should see this.
030726999X|5.0|GREAT BOOK!!  GREAT AUTHOR!!  Don't know what else to say except READ THIS BOOK!!  It's worth the time!!  Very entertaining!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started with Wool 1 to see what I thought. By the end of the evening I'd bought the 1-5 omnibus and started in on it.<br /><br />The basic premise behind the work is interesting, but it's put forth is an engaging manner which makes the journey all that much more rewarding. The tension of the various volumes is well-managed, and offers readers logical chunks to digest it in. The earlier pieces are shorter (with the first being a novelette) while the latter works grow longer and longer, until you have full-length novels in the last two. (I'm guessing The Unraveling is over 40,000 words from the page count.)<br /><br />It's well worth the read for anyone who likes sci-fi or dystopian. There's a reason this is getting a lot of attention lately, and it's not just the author's story. The book is deserving of praise. 5 of 5.
0977326403|5.0|now i just have to read the darn thing....came in the mail right away, some might say too fast....dang pow
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This was a great read, enjoyed the story telling and still got the message as the facts and specific details where welll woven into the story. Fun for runners and aspiring runners. I ran better the next few times after reading this, it is very inspiring and I am looking forward to getting my 1st almost bare feet shoes.

B001KWTBQQ|5.0|I love this movie, it really does add to the Star Wars saga. I purchased it through Amazon instant video, but i am going to buy the Blu Ray version as well. This is a slightly different take on the Star Wars saga, but it still feels like Star Wars. Highly recommend it to Star Wars fans.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I finished reading this book 3 weeks ago and I still feel for and think about these two women.  I think they will stay with me for a long time. I didn't think I would like this book but the reviews were so good and my granddaughter reccommended it so I thought I would try it.<br />Loved It....Excellent read!!!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Great book.  Quick and easy read.  I needed some motivation to get back writing after five months of dealing with family health issues and a 2,400 mile move.  I resembled much of what he discussed in the first section. His discussion and suggestions in the next two sections got me motivated and I am now back on track.  I can see rereading this book several times in the future, especially when writer's block rears its ugly head.  Thank You Steven!
B00B7IJBUY|1.0|not the bon jovi I remember and love. not impressed. I love previous Bon Jovi but the older he gets the more lame his lyrics & music become. MY OPINION!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|These were very interesting books.  At points riveting but always very interesting.  They draw you in and make you want to finish the entire series just to see the end.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed it.  It's an easy, fun, summer read.  Light weight so not much to say about it, really.  If you enjoy picturing Josh D. (in the movie) in a sweet love story, (and I did, a lot, with drool) than this book is for you.
B0070XFNDE|3.0|The vivid depiction of Barcelona continues in this relatively brief next installment by Zafon.  It attempts to merge the worlds of Daniel Sempere from 'Shadow of the Wind' and David Martin from 'The Angel's Game' but falls short of the expectation Zafon has set for himself in those novels.<br /><br />Zafon has a talent for imagery and depictions that blur reality.  His works have been magical and wondrous experiences worthy of reading again and again. 'Prisoner of Heaven' offers the imagery without the enchantment.  Without giving much away, he certainly bursts a lot of bubbles about David Martin.<br /><br />While the novels don't have to be read in any specific order (according to the author), I highly recommend reading 'The Angel's Game' before reading this one because it's sure to ruin your reading experience of that beautiful work if you don't.<br /><br />There were a few questions that lingered at the end of this book, but unlike the others it's not a stand-alone story.  It's more of a transition that's bridging the gap and preparing us for something.  I just certainly hope that Zafon's next and final novel in the series redeems him for this one and makes the readers truly understand why this had to be written in this way... or at all.
0525423281|5.0|I didn't think it was possible, but Stephanie Perkins managed to make me love Lola and the Boy Next Door even more than Anna and the French Kiss. Another home run for the Queen of Contemporary Young Adult Romances.<br /><br />Lola was not your average girl. She saw every day as a chance to reinvent herself, with wigs and costumes; she marched to her own drummer and if you didn't like it, tough noogies. She lived with her too-good-to-be-true dads and dated an older \\"bad boy.\\" Everything was going pretty dandy for Lola until her old neighbors moved back into the house next door.<br /><br />I loved Lola's dads - they let her just be herself and were there when she needed them. They were kind (to each other and to her) and thoughtful and just quirky enough. Her boyfriend, Max, was a few years older, and this was mentioned several times, in an effort to make their relationship almost... naughty. I didn't think the age difference was that big a deal.<br /><br />The neighbors, the Bells, included twins Calliope and Cricket. Calliope was a talented figure skater whose family had moved back to town to advance her career. She was spoiled and selfish, and not a likable character at all. Cricket, well he's one of my favorite book boyfriends ever. He was sweet and nerdy and made of pure awesome.<br /><br />Most of the novel was spent building up the horrible thing that Cricket did to Lola before the Bells moved away, and once we found out what he did, it was a huge letdown. Honestly, it was no big deal at all, and I thought she overreacted quite a bit. The dialogue was fun and real; Lola really had a tendency to say what she was thinking, which led to some amusing situations.<br /><br />The setting of the novel was so well described, I felt like I was right there in San Francisco with the characters. Everything was so lush and descriptive, I loved it. For fans of Anna and the French Kiss, we are treated to a few scenes with Anna and Etienne in Lola. They are just as in love, and Anna provides a sounding board when Lola needs someone to talk out her issues.<br /><br />There were a few clich&eacute;s, and some predictable bits, but they were few and far between. The quirky and fun nature of the book more than made up for those few drawbacks.Anna provides a sounding board when Lola needs someone to talk out her issues.<br /><br />There were a few clichés, and some predictable bits, but they were few and far between.

B005LAIIHG|1.0|Life of Pi: I thought was a ridiculous movie whose only saving grace was an incredible amount of computerized special effects. Many parts of the movie I thought idiotic.  The ending of the movie disappoints, leaving a fantasy world movie into a tale of lies and deceit. I'm glad I watched it at my friends' house and didn't buy it. Overrated for sure. If I purchased this for $15 I'd be crying for having wasted my money!
B006LSZECO|5.0|It will keep  you reading and by the time you get half way through you just can't put it down

B006UG90RM|5.0|I couldn't decide if I was more a Hagar Van Halen fan or a David Lee Roth Van Halen fan. This one has all the flavor of the good old rockers with the advantage of new sounds. Vintage Halen done with new concepts. It's funny to say, but this is probably my favorite Halen album. Too bad they can't get their acts together and stay on tour - although Roth's vocal's sound way better on this CD than they do live.
B00AHXDECG|4.0|I would recommend this album to friends and everyone. Most of the songs are somewhat upbeat, good rhythm, simply wonderful
B0028MBKVG|3.0|I bought this book (Kindle version) based on multiple recommendations from friends.  To be honest, I almost put it down within the first 50 pages.  The style of Christopher McDougall's writing and his attitude came across as arrogant.  I stuck with it though since I was reading it with a friend and was glad I did.  The storytelling evened out and fell into a comfortable rhythm, and I found myself enjoying the book.  It was a quick read, held my interest and was honestly entertaining.  The author's description of the places and personalities he encountered were full enough that I often felt like I was there with them.  In the end, I'd recommend the book to others if they have an interest in running, and with the caution not to judge the book in the early chapters.  Finally, for comparison or reference, once he found his voice, I found McDougall's storytelling style to be similar to Tom Wolfe's &#34;Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&#34;.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Baldacci is engaging and expert at plot development.  However, I preferred the characters in his Camel Club series--chemistry was almost &#34;magical.&#34;  The protagonist, with his imprisoned brother and general officer father, is interesting and effective, but does not engage the reader the way Oliver Stone did.  A pretty good read (or listen).
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Thoughtful and creative, i enjoyed the first season.  The acting and scripts are balanced as the characters develop over time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a total horse nerd... so I find this app awesome. This game is perfect for the horse lover, or for anyone who likes virtual pet type games. you actually get to interact with your horse, and that makes this game very fun to play
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I honestly can't remember the last time I read a story that has truly touched me to the core of my being. Christopher Mcdougall wrote this story so fluidly that there were times I had to remind myself that it was a true story! Extremely touching and poignant! I can't wait to read it again, thank you<3
B0018AO9T4|1.0|It's all the long songs all cut up. It's not the absolutely live album from the 70's. If I could my money back I would.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. You don't have to spend a penny if you can be patient. I would have rated it with five stars but there is currently a glitches asking me to download game content I have already downloaded several times.
B00B7HQ1DA|1.0|Sorry I bought it. No fire, nothing. Bad collection of songs. Should be a way to get your money back.
1455519650|4.0|The Black Ice is a tense, edge-of-your-seat ride in a space shuttle. From a cop's suicide (discovered on Christmas Day) to Bosch's wayfarings south of the border, very few paragraphs are wasted. Smack dab in the middle of a drug cartel's conspiracy, Bosch's character is revealed and dissected in minute detail for the reader. The story slows down to a gentle canter as we are given a glimpse of Bosch's lonely youth and brief reunion with a delinquent father. Untrustworthy to his lovers, Bosch is apt to leak news to tabloids without a second thought. This is clearly contrasted with his compassion to an eighteen-year-old drug dealer, quite rightly regarded by Bosch as \\"just a kid.\\"<br /><br />The \\"romance\\" portions drag a little, and there's a silly filler scene that is out of place in a crime mystery/thriller. It's a jarring interruption that prevents me from giving this novel five stars.<br /><br />The procedural section is handled with a velvet touch (although the absence of a blood test stands out as perplexingly odd). Politics takes on a slightly shifted tone as Irving is now assistant chief, though Pounds is still as unimposing and whiny as ever. Suspense sufficient to steal a minute's breath are present, particularly at the novel's climax, a clandestine takedown operation gone horribly wrong. Sadly, the denouement and wrap-up is done quite clumsily, cramming several dozen chapters worth of exposition into just two. It's quite a disappointment after over 350 pages of good old-fashioned police drama.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have enjoyed many of grisham's novels, but this one is his best wok of all.  It was a fun read, held together by mystery and lots of gamesmanship.  Smiles and curiosity were ample, and each member of the cast was full and rich.  I truly enjoyed reading and was sad to see the story end.  I hope to find another like this in thr grisha library.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The movie is just fine as it is, and what I learned about the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" extended versions is that some of the scenes that were cut were quite entertaining, but turning a three hour movie into a four hour movie isn't worth the extra entertainment.  I'll buy this one and rent the extended cut to see what I missed.  Four hour movies cause you to run out of beer.
0062238868|5.0|It was so refreshing to read a well-written account of a Navy Seal Hero.  This is what being in the &#34;service&#34; meant to so many in our very Active-duty military. It is NOT watered down glory stories.  The entire book is filled with gun-lover facts without any politics.  By novel's end I felt I had been present in battle with Chief Petty Officer Kyle and part of his loving family. This is not a celebration of war but a candid, personal account of an elite American Warier.  I have read other good &#34;Sniper&#34; books but this is a Great Sniper Story in the finest tradition.

0470570954|5.0|i am giving it 5 because well it's a textbook and i need it for class. is it good? well by professor standards and realms of biochem, Voet is the expert and the book of choice. do i like this book? HELL NO! he just goes on and on about techniques and grad research, which is helpful, but what i need for my undergraduate course is hard to pick out.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My young great grandson loves this game. I tried to download it on my laptop but it came with so many other games and extraneous garbage. This app is plain and simple.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Great action film! Great story and fun to follow. I would recommend it as a Prime stream for sure but not worth a purchase.

B001O7SMRG|5.0|Surprisingly (since I've heard some really bad mp3 remixes), this remastering is supremely better than the CD, which is quite bland and midi-sounding. This is a nice relief after my disappointment with the CD version of one of my favorite LP's.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I first watched the movie and then read this book.  It is truly an example of great story telling.  Which version of the story is true.  The reader, like the insurance investigators can make their own decisions.  I have made my decision.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This application hits the sweet spot of. being flexible and very useful. For me it's  indispensable. It's now integrated into my personal and professional workflow.
B0018S6YO4|4.0|I am happy that the CD was delivered to me without scratches and at a very timely pace. I love the songs that I had not quite heard yet.
B0054KCGCG|3.0|There free articles are better than the book.  While I thought it could be applied to any business, it was really about retail and more focused on putting on a show than creating real value.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Enough twists and turns to keep a Rapp fan happy. Provides a nice escape from the everyday, which is after all, why I read Flynn.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Ted is extremely funny, and surprising that what's a one-joke film (foul-mouthed Teddy bear) kinda works as a buddy film feature. But even with good actors (Wahlberg, Kunis, and all the supporting cast) with some decent writing and very funny moments, the end result is flat. Like Family Guy, I don't believe any of the story moments that aren't fueled by jokes, making the entire film feel one-dimensional. The film spends way more time paying homage to 80's films than it does making us believe in the Wahlberg-Kunis relationship, and while that may be to McFarlane fans preference, it's weakens the whole thing overall. It has no heart, all humor, keeping it out of the league of The Hangover, Bridesmaids, The Simpsons, Borat and Austin Powers.
B001NHNG64|5.0|As always so far this book is just as good as all the other Jack Reacher stories I have read.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I like reading romance books and this one looked like a fun theme. Sadly, the cover and blurb deceived me. It began with the heroine throwing up and the hero generally helpless. The initial flashbacks were good, they gave some background, but the way the two got together and stayed together was completely implausible. It's hard to know what's ruling them - it's not their head because their reasoning is crazy; it can't be their hearts because their emotions are all over the place. The story was like a dull roller-coaster. In the end, I read through to the end, but skimmed the final 50%, because it became too boring.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|It was wonderfull to read how the author got started with these stories and how Jack Reacher began his journey.
B008FWHGYS|5.0|A great window to a brief moments in a few characters' life. Excellent movie, I recommend it. One more great job by this director.
B002X3V4P2|4.0|The CD has all of her notable songs and others that retains the flow of the sounds of Enya.  Its great to have all the songs on one disc sort of speak, I had to record it on to 2 discs because the songs would not all fit.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It might not look like a lot, but it sure helps with middle school and high school math! Seriously I recommend this app to you.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|After leaving the Genesis, boy, did he become even more famous for his writing and singing. This encompass most of his achievements but thankfully did not include disney and other musical show songs that he put out later.  Great songs on this album.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I cannot wait for each episode! I enjoy not having to wait for commercials. The best part is that I watch when it is convenient for me.
B0018AM1YY|5.0|He is a lyrical genius.  Young, Neil Young, was really at the height of his form and this CD shows only a small semblance of his writing abilities.  I guess I should collect his older CD (70's), now.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love the Marware Standing Case for my Kindle Fire. I read sitting in my recliner chair and I can just prop it on my lap and read. Also when I fall asleep it doesn't fall  on the floor just sits there.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well, this game is pretty dang awesome. Only sometimes there's no possable way to get out of a situation. Then you automaticly lose. Or if I am in the bad situation the double tap hover board wont activate very fast. Other wise I love this game it is so addicting.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am on Facebook but I don't know what I am doing but I lover looking at the pictures and reading the comments.I do learn something each time I get on Facebook.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I'll never forget the solo walk back to my barracks that night in 1993 after having watched this movie at the base theater. I was a young Marine at the time and deeply moved by what I had just witnessed. I waited for a long time for the Blu Ray to come out and I am not disappointed. One of the most powerfull movies of all time for me.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Listing to me people! Don't get this stupid app. It wouldn't let me do anything it wouldn't even let me take a photo.I am very disapointed with this app!!!!!!!!!!!
B004IK30S2|5.0|I am kind of a big deal! I rate this as one of Will's better movies even though most people do not like it. I like the trading cards that came with the Rich Mahogony edition. Stay classy Amazon!
B00003CXRM|5.0|Purchased this movie to entertain friends.  Each time I view it I appreciate it's dry wit and twisted story line even more.  The music score is outstanding, it gives Blue Grass a whole new audiance to appreciate.  The characters are unique and performances over the top entertainment.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|I'm an &#34;old dog&#34; who doesn't think a smart phone is primarily for playing games, in fact I only have two game on the phone now and the other is solitaire.  The reviews sounded positive and different from the shoot-em-up typical so I tried it on a whim.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The graphics are elegant and simple and the game play is compulsive.  It's also refreshing to see that it seems to maintain the laws of physics.  Don't let that statement dissuade you from trying it however it just means that once you are playing it seems real!<br /><br />This is a game that both young and old will enjoy, even those who typically only like solitaire.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I just started using Pinterest.  I like having the app on my phone so far!  It is easy to use.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I cannot say enough about how well this prenatal workout video has served me! It is just the right combination of cardio, strength, stretching, and relaxation. I always feel so much better after the workout than I did before. I can tell how much good it is doing for toning important muscle groups and stretching out those muscles out to prevent additional discomfort.<br /><br />I started doing the video at about 16 weeks. I'm 28 weeks now and hoping to continue doing this video all the way up until the end, if possible! I currently do this workout about 3 times per week, with other exercise routines on alternating days. Somehow, I look forward to it each time! Erin has a very comfortable teaching style and comes across as a genuinely likable person. She's very encouraging while at the same time pushing you to do your best in the workout.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am so glad that I found this book!<br />I know you will be too.<br /><br />This set of books, five in all, start quick, every chapter leaving you feeling like you need more.<br />Once started, you will find it hard to put down!<br /><br />The mystery is multi-layered, beautifully intertwined with secrets, discoveries, and human emotion.<br /><br />A MUST read book!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game was awesome but the minimum amount of the coin pack was 7 BUCK on sale and that was the only flaw
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Great movie. Nice tie-in to the previous three. Good storyline with suspense. Looking forward to the next Bourne movie. Maybe with Matt Dameon?
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Really good season, a little let down that it didn't start off where season one ended but still really good.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book.  Fortunately, I have not seen the movie so I had nothing to compare it to but the writing was excellent and the story was great....really different angle.  I liked it very much.

B0083ZRAJS|2.0|Short, easy read with great imagination. Lots of visual points. Good for children and young teens. Definitely a classic my kids will read.
B000R34V50|5.0|This is more or less the Turtles of the 80s but with CGI. I was thoroughly impressed with the visuals and most of the storyline. The fight between Raph and Leo is fantastic and well thought to conclusion. I couldn't really ask anymore but that another of these films be made. This one doesn't get enough credit at all. Right up there with some of the better Pixar films, not the best, as far as what it gives back to the viewer. Having been a fan of this series so long you can't help but crack a smile to how well they are realized here. The visuals are top notch on Bluray and you should view them on that format to get the extra bang. A lot of love was put into this and it shows.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|let's celebrate all these years with my favourite band after the beatles of course!give us more years to come with you guys....
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|I just purchased this album and am adding it to my collection of Bon Jovi cd's!!!  I am a long time Bon Jovi fan and have all his prior cd's and this one will not disappoint!!  If you are a die hard fan like me, you will love this album.  It is a bit different from their prior cd's, but that's what I love about the band is the way they come out with new songs!!!  Each song is great if you listen to them all the way through.  I already have a few new favorites!!  Great album!!!  Love it!!!
B002XSP16A|3.0|not really my piece of cake but this one my wife made me buy it? no surprises here! she is getting mellower with age,not better!
B00AOCLWF6|3.0|The show is nothing short of amazing to say the least. It's suspense of what will happen draws you in and will have you watching way past your limit.<br />The quality streaming however was nothing short if pathetic.<br />1. Tested Netflix. No issue<br />2. Watched 3 episodes no issue.<br />3. Started watching.. Constantly mid stream \\"errors\\" had to dashboard on the Xbox reasons restart the app. So far keeps happening and I'm non season 2 episode 2... I hope that it gets resolved
B0045HCJKS|5.0|really nothing to say about this movie..everybody's knows it...yul is the best for this role.i didn't want to say magnificent,of course.

B007KOYEOC|3.0|I found it was repetitive. The main climax of the story came early and then it was like soppy filler.

B000FCKC4C|5.0|One of my favorite and most quotable books. I've read it several times and I highly recommend it for any reader.
0547884591|4.0|I picked up the book from my library. Now I want to get the Kindle version since the book is such a workout(literally and figuratively). Or $10/600 pages for Kindle version equals 1.6 cents per page.<br />It's actually 3 Books in One; Cooking, Learning, and Living well.<br />I'm reserving the 5th star when I actually finish the book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this story. It had me from beginng to end through all three books. It left me wanting more. I hope more stories are written about Anastasia and Christian! I would love too read the whole story again from Christian's point of view.<br /><br />I would most definitely recommend these books. I'm sure I will be re-reading them again soon!

Is a great topic for a book, I must admit I am not able to get past the financial understanding needed to read this book.<br /><br />I can see that the effort has been made for the more common reader to understand the mechanism but at least I was not able to understand it. I am sure that this is great if you understand the financial work and the tools.

B007SGM084|5.0|I love these books. It doesn't get much into a plot until towards the end of the first book but it is completely worth it. I highly recommend these books to anyone looking for a good book with a lot of steam to it as well.
B004APVI1G|3.0|Read quite a few reviews on this movie prior to making the purchase. Have watched more than 40 3D movies since going 3D in 2012 (plasma but whatever, no one cares.)Legends was the first movie I have seen where there was ghosting. Not to mention more than several scenes (mostly backdrop)were out of focus. Tried liking the movie and perhaps one day will give the 2D aspect a try. Will type this, the animation/CGI are quite impressive and picture quality for the most part clear, it's just the ghosting double exposure and out of focus stuff that got in the way.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love the movies. My daughter got me hooked. This was a great way to end the series. Recommend it
B000SSV8HI|5.0|I am 55 years old. When I was a &#34;little girl&#34; most every &#34;little girl&#34; LOVED the Beatles. They argued over which Beatle was the cutest- Paul, George, John, or Ringo. I wasn't one of those girls. I only had eyes for Keith Richards. I LOVED the Rolling Stones. I still LOVE the Rolling Stones. And Keith Richards. I will also admit to looking at Mick Jagger, Ron Wood, Charlie Watts. Charlie Watts is an Arabian Horse breeder and more famous as a Jazz drummer. Eh?
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I love the Disney movies. I bought this to replace one that became scratched after owning it about 17 years.
B008966SLM|3.0|A great album musically but the lyrics of the songs are very weak.  A disappointing album considering it's status as a Grammy winner.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I loved this film, however, the ending left me a wee bit sad.  Plenty of good action, bits of humor and a bit more info on Bond as well as M.  As with most Bond films, the action moves so quickly, that the film never bogs down.  Daniel Craig is excellent in his third outing as Bond and Judi Dench is ALWAYS excellent in her role as M.  I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this to any Bond fan and even newbies to the series should find this quite enjoyable.
B0000029AL|4.0|This was either my 3rd or 4th record, that I  ever bought by Aerosmith in 1976, after \\"Dream On\\" entered the charts AGAIN. There was a much better & shorter version of \\"Dream On\\" when it first reached #59, on the charts, in the Fall of 1973. I had always liked the shorter version of \\"Dream On\\", so much better. The other small hit from this album was \\"Mama Kin\\", which was very familiar when I first bought the record. It's an excellent song, along w/ \\"Make It\\", which is the perfect way to START the album. \\"Movin' Out\\", is another one of my favorite songs here. I love the SCRATCHING sound of the guitar on \\"Walkin' the Dog\\". It sounds as though the dog has an itch on it's skin! \\"Write Me a Letter\\" & \\"One Way Street\\" are pretty good songs, although I didn't like \\"One Way Street\\" too much, when I first got this album. \\"One Way Street\\", seems to remind of \\"Midnight Gambler\\", by the Stones, from THEIR 1969 album titled \\"Let it Bleed\\". Back to Aerosmith now, the song \\"Somebody\\" is okay, actually kinda funny, lyric wise, but it's not one of my favorites. Even though \\"Dream On\\" was the BIGGEST hit on this album & it charted in '73 & again in '76, it is NOT my favorite on this album @ all.  Just recently, I bought this album in CD format & it's good to hear these songs all over again. Definitely recommended.

0547848412|5.0|Upon the release of the celebrated film adaptation of Yann Martel's seminal Man Booker Prize winning `Life of Pi,' I picked up a copy I received for my birthday to investigate for myself what all the hype and excitement was about. And what a great decision that was, `Life of Pi' is a literary treasure of incredible artistic merit that is sure to be absorbed into great modern canonical prose. Martel writes with inimitable lucidity and with powerful and memorable imagery in a wonderfully original framed narrative. He tells a tale of an idealistic Indian boy named Piscine Molitor Patel with a simple self-proclaimed nick name `Pi' who traces his discovery of religion as well as his rich childhood growing up with his family managing the Pondicherry zoo against the back drop of secular South India in the 1970s.<br /><br />The philosophical musings, zoological lore and childhood anecdotes provide the spiritual foundation for the rest of the novel where Pi is unexpectedly thrust into the heart of a storm mid migration with his family and his prized animals en route to his new home in Canada. The resulting cataclysm of finding himself on a claustrophobic life raft alone with an almost perpetually ravenous 450lb Bengal Tiger with the most unlikely appellation of Richard Parker in the middle of the vast Pacific ocean gives rise to one of the most cathartic and magical experiences I have ever experienced whilst flicking through paper pages. Without revealing the more intimate details of this beautiful novel, Martel's imaginative allegorical exploration of human survival, friendship, despair, savagery, love and God ask some of the most philosophically significant questions that have perplexed and pleased us for millennia in cascading proliferation. At the end of `Life of Pi,' I was left with the unfamiliar and immiscible sensations of satisfaction and sadness.<br /><br />Read `Life of Pi,' not for a good yarn and momentary entertainment as I originally set out to, but like an explorer in a conquest for silver who finds gold, found myself misguided in the most satiating way. I was left with a piece of surrealist literature that remains to me in one word an experience. An entrancing book suffused with marvel and wonder that conjures such a myriad of emotions and passion, a book that is such a wholesome manifestation of human imagination is well worth the disproportionately small number of hours required to complete it.

One expects a pop psychology light read, and, instead, the reader is escorted through a massive but curiously interesting blend of history, established and surprising fact, science, and, at it's core, applied economics which has been ripped from stale economic textbooks and woven into delightful stories of cunning, theft, misery, intellectual triumph, delightful mischief, and even sex. Imagine that Kurt Vonnegut and Carl Hiaasen had joined forces to author a freshman economics tome, this book would be a close match.  In the end one completely and, perhaps somewhat reluctantly, accepts his premise: things have never, ever, been better than they are right now, and we are riding a tidal wave of social, scientific, and economic evolution, producing a global, connected intellectual beehive of minds and acquired talents, all of which will only accelerate the advance of useful knowledge, in an exponential in dizzying fashion, and we seem, VERY curiously, almost totally oblivious to it, even though it is the most important intellectual achievement we've ever produced as a species. After reading this book I've come to realize that the pessimism one feels from watching the evening news has no foundation in fact or science, and that the evening TV newscast is simply designed to fire enough neurons in one's brain stem to command one's attention long enough to sit through commercials pitching denture powder and laxatives, and that the TV news program, in and of itself, is ALSO an evolved mechanism which is the product of specialized labor on the part of skilled TV production workers and marketers, practicing their ever evolving craft. There are so many interesting historical facts that I amassed more than 300 annotations on my kindle version, many of which I've passed on to my friends. the author provides enough carefully researched evidence to challenge many long lived political core beliefs of both conservatives and liberals. Forexample, is Walmart truly bad for the country? I used to think so, and I no longer do.  Has there ever been any long term powerful government that has not stagnated? Is partial fragmentation of a governing body, while still maintaining rule of law and efficient trade infrastructure, actually the BEST environment in which to produce creative and useful technology and trade? Has there ever been any country that did NOT have a government strong enough to provide the rule of law which prospered? Why do so many countries devoid of natural resources do so well? Does the penchant for extending the military might of a superpower really enhance quality of life for it's citizens, or does it inevitably lead to a self serving decay that only enhances the power of it's leaders? What do priests, thieves and emperors all have in common? This book was a VERY pleasant find, which I stumbled upon, and I'm quite surprised I haven't seen more of this author in the media. Jon Stewart?? Steven Colbert??
1616550414|5.0|My brother and I have been playing Zelda together since the days of NES. Love this book for all the background information on the characters and the detailed explanations of how the concepts were come up with!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Was to funny like you think it is going to happen<br />Plus it has crazy pictures and I'm pretty sorry for him he always gets in trouble
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|It wasn't the best one but it has a bad ending .The ending is not going to happen you can't go to a country club every day.
B0012FHGCW|2.0|Ok, to sum it up, I didn't like the ending - no wait, I didn't like the whole movie.  Sure it's based on a true story, but what are we supposed to get out of this?  Grow up privileged, then shove it back in your parents' faces, strike off on your own and have some fun, then head off \\"into the wild\\" without a clue and get really mad (no wait, dead) when it doesn't work out?  On a positive note though, the scenery was excellent!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Awesome album!  Love love love the music of Mumford & Sons.  Many of the songs give me &#34;goosebumps&#34; every time I listen!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My children loved this movie.  It had a very sweet storyline.  We watched it about four times in the two days we had it, and now they want to buy it.  It's a great family movie.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Best show ever.  Recommend it for every one. Season one, excellent. Season two builds on that. X x x x.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Great book for people who love to learn and in particular want to learn how to really cook!<br />This is an approach to cooking not a wiki of recipes. Each recipe is used to highlight a particular skill or concept.<br />I love it so much I have bought a paper version as well as the digital.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|back to back,  a whole season at a time, goes to the next episode without having to search again, cool
B00006FDCJ|5.0|A stunning movie that combines Clint Eastwood as a has-been-bad-guy. This movie will give you everything you want in a classic Eastwood movie, gun fights, saloon girls, a nasty antagonist and Clint Eastwood opening a big ole can of whoop-*ss.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wonderful writing 5/5! Disney did a great job on this, was very underrated when it came out. Great for all ages
1609611543|3.0|I found it to have a little too much detail.  I also ordered the Wheat Belly Cookbook, and felt that I could get everything in that.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The suspense was great. The subject matter was relevant to today's news. This is an easy read that would be great for a beach trip or vacation read.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|They did a wonderful job.  The scenery was spectacular and the plot was thrilling.  It was great that the main characters that we loved so much could have a part in this picture.  Thanks to all who worked on this project.

B00AYHK7RU|5.0|Great album. His best in 30 years.    This review and analysis sums it up better than I can and awards it 4.5 stars overall but scores each song on a separate basis:    [...]
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is beast yet I can't win at it yet ready to get a free gem of a house or your mom
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is ok. easy to to use. my niece is going to love it she wants a horse. wish u could start a a baby
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is a lot of fun to play.The graphics are well made and it is hard to stop playing.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I haven't played MC since the first one came out a couple years ago. I thought I would like to try this one and I am so glad I did. The graphics are just as good as a console can offer in my opinion. With headphones on the sound is incredible and trust me if you have little kids around you'll want them. There is a lot language. I just started playing and there seems to be a good story plot behind the game. The best thing is this game was on sale .99 cents. But even at the seven dollar range its well worth the giant download (almost 2gb) but my KindleFire handles it just fine. Gameloft knocked this one out of the park.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I've only played a few rounds. Just want it to quit asking me to rate the app! Three more words...
B002PEP4SC|5.0|If you enjoy Castle on tv, you'll probably enjoy this book. Very similar feel; it does read like something Castle would write during an episode.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|Only for fans. It is definitely not as good as other Harry Hole books. A bit predictable and not so well written.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Pc is better but this app is still awesome!<br />TechCrunch B-) f2f f2f buff ghost f2f dggxgbvvhhcg f2f  / chin cg
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This season establishes a new and fun relationship between The Doctor and Donna Noble-it's fun, witty, and a great continuation of the series!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|While an excellent read, the way in which the book ends is unsarisfactory, as none of the characters have enough time to fully delevop, and most of the royal family apart from the drunk one, come across as bi-polar.
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|Had to read this for class. I thought it would be boring and a tough read. I was completely wrong. It reads very easily and has some great idea  and concepts. I highly recommend this book
B003XVYLDU|3.0|I'm really not in sci-fi. Read the book to see why it was once on the banned list. It's okay, kinda weird for me.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The steps were just enough of a challenge to keep me going.  I played longer than I planned but, I just had to find out the next clue
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I found it very interesting. Loved the characters to see how history affected them personally. Can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|all in all this game is awesome! it is annoying that you can buy stuff with real money but you can with almost all games. you can always put parentel controls to limit yourself to buy stuff
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I thought this was a great action packed movie, but the story wasn't as deep as the original three. I still thought it was a good movie, and I liked how the movie was set up to run concurrently with the other Bourne story. If you're a fan of the series, I think you'll enjoy this movie as well.
B000002O3I|5.0|very good selection of some of The Wolf's best bues tunes ~ I'd reccommend for anybody that digs the blues!!!
B000NI8F5G|5.0|This is a timeless movie, wonderfully entertaining and enjoyable by all audiences.  Good clean fun for all.  We need more movies with actors/actresses so talented.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Fast paced page turner. Could not put it down. A blending of yesteryear and technology. With a true message of friendship.
B0095P31L6|3.0|The premise is obviously very stretched but overall the movie was entertaining. The dialog was clean and it was easily viewable by children if you don't mind them seeing the snake or the hawk. The drama was a little overdone and I wished for more humor. But overall a moderately fun evening. Toy Story it isn't.
0142428280|5.0|I have listened to the recordings and they suited my purpose which was<br />to know the core content of the book without having to read 800 pages.
B004QX07G4|1.0|not ellens fault i,m not much of a funny person, i tryed to read but i couldn't deceide when she was manking funny, i see her on tv show and enjoy her being so kind with her money
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I baught this for my husband after buying him a blue ray player for christmas and my 3 and 6 year old like it better than he does.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Depressing book to get into.  Have heard that it gets better half way through.  My friends overall opinion of this book was &#34;it's disturbing&#34;.
B004HYXW1O|5.0|I liked their previous album, so this one was a no-brainer. Every song is on the CD is great. It is refreshing to see that good lyrics haven't died yet like most current music. The only complaint is that it is like most of The Script's songs in that they are usually pretty same-y. The type of music is pretty well liked by just about everyone, which makes it a great CD to own.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|I have gotten into to watching some of the ''Mob&#34; videos on Youtube... I love how they did Mob music scencs in this movie. The moves and stunts were awsome. Love this movie, and recomend it.
B0033H7VI6|2.0|Was very impressed out of the box however, I used it to cut thick bait, washed it off and was surprised how quickly the blade and the handle rivets rusted. I would not consider this a good survival knife and seems like you'd have to really maintain this.  I consider this a value knife and if/when camping, I'd spend more money and get something else.
B008220C38|1.0|The directing of the movie was weird! Scenes would play out on a curtained theater stage, I just did not like that.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This & book 3 were a little slower paced, but more character developement, then books 1 & 2. Still not to be missed in my opinion if you plan to finish the series because of all important new information you pick up.
1616550414|5.0|Great quality on hard cover and inside sheets, nice colors and for fans is a jewel. I love this saga and i love this book
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Exciting storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Rich characters that with the twists & plot changes leave you waiting for more!
1451675046|5.0|Small in size, wide in scope, a most enjoyable read.  Dawkins doesn't dumb it down but he's not stuffy or pretentious.  A bright young student will find him accessible while we old-timers won't be disappointed either.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|This & book 4 were a little slower paced, but more character developement, then books 1 & 2. Still not to be missed in my opinion if you plan to finish the series because of all important new information you pick up.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool.It's a game u just want to play all day long!!!! Who ever reads this download the game it's awesome!!!!!!!!!!
1452110581|5.0|Gave this to a cat loving friend as a gift and he thought it was a hoot! Plan on buying more for the rest of my cat loving friends & relatives. Just wish they had an e version for myself!
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is really really really really really really really really really really really good. Totes amaze. Get it, deffo.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Spellbound during the entire movie. Will now have to read the novel to fill in the blanks. Ang Lee's directing was superb.

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|The game is very easy to learn and understand, yet takes time to master.  This is perfect as you don't need an extensive tutorial to show you how to use the game controls.  Still it takes practice so you'll desire to play it over and over.  The graphics are stunning and the music is peaceful, which adds to the desire of running the app.
B00001QGPS|5.0|Blackout is one of my favorite rap albums and my dad used have this CD I wanted to go and get CD but they didn't sell it but still method man & Redman gotta be one of the greatest rap duos in hip hop history
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a previous supervisor. I absolutely loved it. It is the first book I have read in a very long time. It makes me wonder how my dog would narrate her life.
B000IZ6URY|5.0|Yo this movie is very hilarious' It made soda come out of nose like Trey Parker gotta be one of the most animated directors of all time but I Got this movie on my tablet so that means I can watch any day any time. It's a must see you must watch this!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Incredibly useful in the nose of our lives a wonderful addition to the one who knows where that quiet place is .
B00985E3UG|4.0|OMG! If this book doesn't scare you into eating right, there's no hope.<br /><br />Wait. There probably isn't hope anyway.<br /><br />This well researched and heavily documented book details the lengths that the huge food conglomerates - think General Foods, Nestle, Kraft, and more - go to keep us addicted to high calorie, high fat, high sugar and high salt convenience/processed food. In fact, it is the convenience that enables these companies to continue to churn out these foods that barely supply the nutrients you need to live. Instead, we are marketed to with laser-like precision so that we fill our grocery carts with the junk that encourages obesity, diabetes, hypertension and more.<br /><br />It's really a scary book. In fact, about half way through it, I was overcome with a feeling of helplessness and powerlessness in the face of these humongous, multi-national food producers. They literally have billions and billions of dollars with which to formulate food or, more accurately, pseudo-foods that set up a craving for more, more, more. More salt. More sugar. More fat.<br /><br />The book itself is extremely well researched and documented with well over 200 notes in the back citing the authors sources. It's a relatively easy read although it does get a little deep in the weeds from time to time.<br /><br />Still, the book is worth the time and effort it takes to read it. You will never look at food the same way, again, either in the grocery store or your local restaurant or sub shop.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|There is a great wide range of music to choose from and you can skip as many times as you want!
B0026SCMNM|5.0|very simply told story, and surprisingly powerful. The inner life of the main character, a young Irish woman immigrant in Brooklyn after WWII, is revealed slowly and quietly.
1401324649|5.0|I gave mine to my husband and sent another to my sister!  My husband enjoyed the historical thread.  Fun read.
B009PHRIAE|5.0|OK, I'm going to agree with the other reviewer that you should snap up this set.  Unfortunately, the US Amazon didn't have any useful information about what is on the set.<br /><br />The Frans Brüggen Edition is a box-set of 12 CDs containing many recorder recordings made by Frans Brüggen for Telefunken/Das Alte Werk between 1962 and 1979.

B0076DELIG|5.0|Absolutly one of the very best Harry Bosch novels . Michael Conelly can tell a story, weave a web, keep you reading late into the night and when you thought you might have the mystery figured out he lets you know he is still in charge and throws that curve ball then reveals the end.  This book is the reason I always look for more books by  Connelly. Thank you and please continue writing these great books
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|I loved the movie and all of the \\"included bonus material\\" already. Specifically, I thought it was neat that they included extra content from the canon that wasn't explicitly part of the novel.<br /><br />Warner Bros, however, has turned into a truly greedy company, though. I'm not going to touch this version because the extended edition will be released later. Likewise, I have to say that UltraViolet SUCKS!!! I've yet to have a code that actually worked. Likewise, you can't download the video to an iPad or other Apple device with any ease whatsoever.<br /><br />If you want digital copy, buy it from your respective device's store.
B005LJITS0|4.0|Green Lantern was the long awaited DC release that everyone has been waiting for. If you like superhero action and back stories I feel that GL delivers. Planet Oa was well created and there was stunning CG characters throughout. With that said, there seemed to be some elements missing from this dominate character of the DC Universe. perhaps its Mister RR was a little off  but whatever the case, you've come to the right place if you are looking for over the top CG and a generous amounts of heroic might from GL.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I saw Searching for Sugarman and immediately went out and bought both of Rodriguez's albums.  I opened Cold Fact first and listened to it for a month of driving.  I loved it and was hesitant to open up Coming from Reality.  I thought I would be disappointed, but not to worry.  This disc is great as well.  The music is different from that on Cold Fact, softer, more gentle love songs.  I will be listening to this for some time to come.  Am going to try to see the man in concert if possible.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BUY IT<br />best game ever<br />not a waste of money<br />almost as good as the original<br />buy it buy it buy it buy it
0062086529|5.0|This was one of my son's favorite books growing up. Now he is expecting his first child, and this was on his registry as a must have. I tried to find it in cloth book form, but the board book construction also makes it a great format to be able to introduce this classic at an early age. Children need durable books (cloth/board) at any early age to get them into appreciating books!
B009ZUZ9FW|5.0|It has lots of words and things.  Also it talks about things like computers. This book is recommended if you just want to chill out and have a good time.  10/10 book of the year would buy again.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|...but Mark Wahlberg pulls it off. Only criticizism we have is that Seth McFarlane might have considered a new voice for Ted.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Reminds of the Xfiles but with another demional twist. Sometimes the future events and past events through me for a lupe. But that is what makes this series compiling and additive.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|While we don't mind movies that are formulaic, this one seemed a bit stale...maybe we've seen too many movies & not much impresses any more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It reminds me when I was young and a friend turned me on to victorian romance novels. All through junior high school you would not see me without a novel or two in my hand checking out of the libary. I love this series and recommend to everyone.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Can't tell you how good this movie is or is not because, yet again, Amazon streaming stopped working less than 5 minutes into the movie and this locks the whole system up for hours! PLEASE UPGRADE THIS TECHNOLOGY!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved the history that was portrayed in this book. The setting, the every day lives of the slaves and the horrifying things they endured , but also the care and respect they had for each other.  We have come a long way here in America!  Great reading!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|We didn't realize that this was the pre-quell to Alien, et al. until the end of the movie which meant we spent too much time during the movie puzzling this out. We'll have to watch it again with a fresh view but...anything Ridley Scott is good in our book.
B00BHMF578|5.0|A little busy and slow to start, the tempo picked up and had me cheering out loud at the end.  The level of suspense throughout the story kept me on my toes.  Great cast, great movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I happened upon Downton Abbey by chance and blaze through season 2 quickly. Aside from the compelling, interwoven story lines between the upstairs wealthy and the downstairs servants the acting, filming, history, costuming and decor were beyond anything I have seen from a TV series. Thank goodness there was a season 3!
B0000TG9E2|5.0|my niece kept asking me for this video and was thrilled with it once she got it. she must've seen it 20 times already.
B007ZMCTNW|5.0|If you love Fado music, then this is for you.  Great music by great musicians. I highly recommend it to the Fado and music lovers.
B007Y612KA|4.0|A modern retro movie with a good plot good actors and decent writing.  It was an enjoyable escape for an hour or so.The special effects mad it seem like I was watching a movie made in the '30's or '40's.<br /><br />I have watched it twice and enjoyed it more the 2nd time.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I have seen other people have this and it's as funny as can be.. but it didn't work on my KindleFire HD.. nothing! at least it was free.
B002P8G2AM|4.0|Skynyrd is truly &#34;in the house&#34; and really hasn't left. This is a fun collaboration and resultant album considering two more members of Skynyrd unfortunately passed away during the making of this album but Skynyrd music will always live on.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Thank u for making this app!! Its sooooooo addicting!! That's why I love it! &lt;3&rarr;&hearts;!! I reccomend this app to anyone that wants to waste time playing games&hellip; 5&#9733;'s
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Adele is truly a gift that comes along only a few times in one's lifetime. She is awesome and her stage presence is natural. She loves and appreciates her fans unlike those who would take them for granted. I love her down-to-Earth attitude and playfulness which will impress on her fans that she feels her music and reacts to her feedback graciously.
B00005V9IL|5.0|People on A under water drilling rig for more money are asked to find A lost nuclear sub.But when they find it one of the grew on A mini sub sees something shes never seen before.During there's A lot craryness that goes on,and other things such as finding aliens that live in the oceans.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Great music by Michael Jackson. Nice compilation of his hits and iconic songs. Glad that they went the two disc route instead of cutting songs.
0425263908|5.0|I got done reading fifty shades and was left wanting more. Knowing there wasnt anymore, I had to find something else. I came across this book in a search and read it right away. After fighting the boring first chapter or so, it got really good and I was hooked. Read it in a day. If your feeling that you need another story with a man who has an obsessive control freak attitude, this is the book.
B003YWUTJI|3.0|Couldn't listen to it on Amazon Cloud because it stopped and started with the stops lasting between 30 seconds to a minute or longer.  When the disk came in the mail, i uploaded it to Windows Media Player and itunes and had the same problem, but not as bad.  Took it out to the car and it only skipped a few times.  Bought a Crosby, Stills and Nash mp3 and it plays fine on the cloud player.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Very funny family movie with great characters. My kids go around quoting lines from the movie all the time. Highly recommended.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|So hilarious! Love it so much!!! Deff would recommend it. Post this grrr. Deff longer than 20 letters now -_- lolol
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The characters make the movie and this movie has some great characters. The Minions steal the show. The only down side is that the characters are all, well, despicable. There really are no &#34;good guys.&#34; I mean, they are all villains. They may learn to love, but they're still villains in the end.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|These episodes are very good, it's hard to fueling them other places around the internet this is really convenient. This season focuses on the prison.
1451695195|5.0|I found this book to reinforce my innate beliefs  about the afterlife. I have recommended this book to a number of friends.  It rings true to me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl -----  Started slow and really picked up --- a lot of suspense ----  the last half left me wondering what is going on.  The suspense kept changing.  Amy was portrayed as very strange and she got stranger.  Not too happy about the ending.  Kept me wanting to keep on reading.
0143034901|4.0|My book club is reading this richly complex novel.  I am just beginning to read it and am experiencing the &#34;I can't put this down&#34; sensation.  this is the reason I read to get lost in a wonderful adventure.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I used to think this game was lame because it sounded nerdy. all my friends were like &quot;ERMAH GERDNI GERTA A LERP YER DRERGON!!&quot;  and I'm all like &quot; THAT GAME SUCKS!!&quot; and now that ive played it I see that it an addicting and lovable game and I reccomend you give it a try
B0015XHP3Q|5.0|A timeless movie. I remember hearing that Stallone was working on this project way back when. He had heard how the Afgans were being persecuted by the Russians & wanted to tell the story of how a small group of fighters with heart & were willing go give their lives for God (Allah) & Country were willing to stand up to a world super power. INTERESTING. I do believe the story proves that point too (in a Stallone way), and showed just how quick the people were willing to sacrifice themselves and blame their oppressors for their plight. Furthermore, they were willing to never forgive... never forget... and act out in vengeance against this super power to the second & third generation. Unfortunately, the Russians gave up trying to dominate the \\"rebels\\" and pulled out before the movie's release, so the story just became a plot for a new Rambo movie. Now we have been fighting against the Afgan Islamic Fanatics. In the end, I've always wondered if Rambo had inadvertently trained a young UBL?
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I Absolutely love this game!!!! Trust me, if you like Mario Bros, then you will love this. Plus how can you not get this. IT'S FREE!!!!
B007I6GCT2|5.0|Hey it is blu-ray and i already had the dvd. will be buying more cause it was as described in the sale
B009UX2YAC|5.0|fun and good graphics. it<br />is like temple run alot but different in a way. I love it and that is all i can say
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|My fiance and I really enjoyed this movie.  It's a great story and told very beautifully.  Really great funny moments as well as some deeper emotional considerations.  Loved it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What I think of this game is that some people say that it looks boring and not that fun. And once u get to play it more you will get a hang of it and tell other people to play it.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|This is definitely an Underrated Sci-Fi classic. Pick it up if you like Sci-Fi. Really though provoking and touching film.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I absolutely love this book! It was super great. I would recommend this book to people who like a different kind of romance book.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|while you can grow your village without purchasing anything it takes forever. I am over the games that require you to spend hundreds of dollars just to play at a decent speed.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Really enjoyed the storyline, great graphics. Will play other games like t this. The music did get a little annoying. Good game.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|basically you just take care of a horse, cyber pet type of game. Not a whole lot of fun to play.
B002BVZ2GI|5.0|This one, I would purchase. It is an all around great film about relationship building, finding love and having the support of family and friends all in a silly & sometimes whacky environment but it all makes sense. &#34;He's Just Not That Into You&#34; will make you laugh or possibly cry because the characters are believable and likeable with the extreme capability of drawing you into their troubles. The film comes full circle and there is a happy ending. I truly enjoyed it and think you will as well. 5 Stars.<br /><br />SKC,<br />March 16, 2013
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|Great animation. action scenes look real. great characters. Super funny. A Disney best. This is one worth owning for sure
B009VB9VKY|2.0|The story line was very unclear and boring. I deserve to have a refund on this one. The trailer lured me in and once I bought in I was terribly disappointed with what I was seeing. Channing Tatum was awesome when he danced on stage but nothing else made sense. I was embarrassed for Matthew Mcconaughey too I won't say more however you've been warned. Boogie Nights &#34; Magic Mike definitely is not. I'm rating it 2.5 because Tatum's dance moves deserves the praise. He should have shot a film with himself dancing for 2 hours and no dialogue. It would have been a better investment of time and talent. My opinion.<br /><br />SKC<br />March 16, 2013
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Howmcan you notmlove this collection of the Godfather collection.  Grat value and itmwill always have a honored place in our movies.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|excellent book- the author leaves u wanting more- I can't wait to dive into the third book. I have and will recommend this to many of my women friends.
B000A2H812|5.0|We played 5 Gogol Bordello CDs over & over as roadtrip music - they got us through 1500 miles with never a sleepy moment.  High-energy music!
B000JRYOPG|3.0|GOT THIS FLICK BECAUSE OF MY FRIENDS! IT WAS OK COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER! I WOULD LIKE TO SEND ONE TO FRIENDS
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is a very well written and highly readable (despite extreme scientific detail) of a near death experience. By use of scientific information the author eliminates most of the usual objections to accounts of near death experiences as a basis to conclude there is life after death and a world beyond our own. But the author does not overcome the problem of the philosophical incompatibility between use of natural senses and recollections to prove contact with the supernatural.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It's an amazing book! I love every part. It is just wonderful! Everyone should read it. You wont regret it!
0394800192|2.0|I am hoping that the book meets my expectations when it finally arrives. Hopefully it will get here some day soon....
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|This is an absolutely beautiful film and I'm not just talking about the wonderful images of the Hawaiian islands.  The characters feel like people you really know and care about.  They have pulled together the most incredible group of first class actors to portray these characters, and the two girls playing the daughters belong right in that elite group.  Just writing about it makes me want to put it back on and watch it again - right now!
B005HSL626|2.0|Downloaded this on a whim because my grandson (who's 4) was playing it and we had this little competition going over who would chop up more melons....need I say more?
B00802EYDO|5.0|First, the sound quality is fantastic,  second PB is a great artist.  Even if you aren't a PB fan buy this DVD for the sound quality experience.
B0086700CM|3.0|Another one of those &#34;you got to try this game&#34; downloads.  Not ever a good idea when it comes from your grandchild. Really, now I'm dodging rolling boulders and falling over cliffs and trying to control a running micro sized human?  I think I got heart palpitations during play time...LOL
B007REV4T8|4.0|This movie was not as intense as 007 of yesteryear but I enjoy Daniel Craig as Bond!  I enjoy the new Bond theme
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I love kids movies and this one was the best I've seen in a while. It had a unique story which we don't get enough of these days, kid friendly jokes, and even some jokes for the parents to get. Great for all ages. I watched this as a date movie with my boyfriend, we're 21 and 23. 10/10 would watch again.
0800132343|5.0|Really interesting film. You get the feel of life on a sub; and how short life expectancy was during WWII.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Liked it! Got the mp3 download which made the purchase easy and quick to enjoy.I would recommend this dvd to Kid fans.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app<br />It is so much fun to play on  i hope that  like it to so if your thinking about getting this app you should because you will love it as much as I do
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I heard that BBC was filming a mini-series based on this story so I was anxious to read it. While I can envision this making an exciting mini-series, I did not really like the book and can't recommend it to my fellow Pride and Prejudice fans. Darcy and Elizabeth share very little conversation and I found it frustrating! The author alludes to the fact that they are a happy couple but you are rarely able to see them together or hear them interact. Disappointing!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Pretty much the same mechanics as the first but with great graphics. If you liked the first you'll like this one.  DISCLAIMER: I haven't played long enough to find glithches for my Kindle Fire.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Everyone loves this game in my house. My husband said its better than any game we've paid for.  A great time passer. its great for the kids too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the character development and the emotion and the flow of action. This book was great and far exceeded my expectations!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Martin's masterful imagery, richly defined characters, and hair-raising medieval suspense make for yet another nail-biting, page turning reading experience.  This series will long be remembered as one of the great yarns spun by a man who is at the very top of his game.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is so fun, it can. be that game you play when you have spare time or you can spend hours playing it, and its free what's not to like!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is NOT a rip off like other games! You should really buy this app! The game isnt like temple run or the second temple run. Subway Surfers ROCKS!!!!!!!!! Lol!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is a masterpiece from gameloft that should have came out when the Kindle Fire was first released.There are many reasons to own the game.If you have Amazing Spider-Man on Xbox 360,you should download this game.You can also get this game on Steam for $59.99.<br />If you just got a Kindle Fire,this game will download fast.If you had a Kindle Fire when it first came out,this game will take over 9,000 years.Don't be fooled if the game downloads fast,because it requires additional data to be downloaded.I'd say to give this a 9.5 rating
B00499NHLC|5.0|Had been hoping that Amazon Prime would pick this show up after reading about it on the internet.  I was not disappointed.  The 21st century Holmes and Watson have interesting back stories and the mysteries they solve are complex and interesting.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Osmos HD is a simple yet novel game making for a trance inducing experience. I like how the player can continue getting bigger after the challenge has been met.
B009FZFONO|5.0|more than a word. better than previous seasons.<br />you can see how much title roles are grown up. actions are more viable.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love this music!  A couple songs I wish they had put on too, but what they put on it is great!
1885167776|5.0|Gary Keller and Jay Papasan have hit this one out of the park. Really a guide to living a large life - the focusing question \\"What is the ONE thing you can do such that by doing it everything else would become easier or unnecessary\\" seemingly simple but equally complex. This book blows up the myths and drills down to what you specifically need to do to not just do the best that you can do but the best it can be done. A must read
B0016OOS16|5.0|A little hard to get use to, but now that I have used it, it makes working easier. It is mobile. Probably not a ton more than the regular one. It is still fairly heavy. There is a suction-cup type base so it stays put
B001KQGEL2|5.0|I would recommend it to your friends. Queensryche has always been one of my favorite bands. This was a great buy from Amazon.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|plugged in, turned off my wifi and plugged into wall. Worked great. I like to carry in my bag because retina macbook doesn't have the RJ port. Fits the bill.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. Nice to be able to get the Trilogy in one package for a very good price.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie so I bought the book. The book is just as great! Don't expect to follow along with the movie, it doesn't. Since it is a memoir it's obvious the movie took some liberties in changing the order of things. Definitely a great read!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I was looking for a game I could enjoy. Found it. this is a great game. Only complaint is needing to spend real money.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I enjoy playing this game whenever I have free time. What a great find. I wish they would give breeding times ahead of breeding, but all in all I play every day!!!!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|It had great characters and a great plot. Could not put it down! I cannot wait to read the next one!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I highly recommend this game.This game is awesome period.It is so scary literally like the 20th time I played the scaryness still didn't get old.I yelled so loud cause he just popped up right in front of me so scary.Get this game it NEVER gets old like EVER.Get it NOW!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was so I interesting I couldn't stop reading it. It is a different kind of reading for me. Isaac intrigued by this book because I have never read anything like this before. It got my attention. I rated this book 5 stars because it was good reading. Yes, I would recommend it to everybody.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was a gift for my partner and the lenticular cover on the front was an added bonus. Won me some serious brownie points! Very happy with the product, the movie and the features.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works perfectly with kindle fire he. It looks like an office style calculator and it's easy to see and it's easy to use. Works perfectly.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is the ultimate combo pack and I was SO pleased when it arrived. The movie is fantastic and thanks to Amazon it was such a great price! This would make a excellent present.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I recently saw this app and decided to look at it, as it looked pretty fun. It's incredibly fun! It keeps me entertained and it's very interesting. Of course, the idea of the game IS to kill of humanity, it's not like it would ever happen. If you have a strong hatred for humanity and are plotting to take it down, would you spend time playing a game? And you do not have to pay for every little thing. You play the game and unlock the items as you go. The option to pay for them is there, but you don't necessarily have to. If you're too lazy to play the game then you'll end up either paying the money or quitting. It's fun, and the things are all fairly easy to unlock. It's so fun!
B004I654WQ|5.0|I loved this movie from the moment it hit the big screen. Great fun for all ages and some incredible integration of car history into the storyline and environments. Just a beaut movie.
B00846WWVM|5.0|added this to my kindle fire on a whim (cute name) for my grandsons...  loved it ,,, didn't take them long to master it ,,,, good non violent thought provoking game
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie. Casion Royale is still my favourite (of the Craig series) but this is a very close second. Very entertaining and a surprise ending. Packaging of this special edition pack is quite stylish. Matt finish with a spot varnish for the imagery. Ideal for a present.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|The game is awesome.if u are kewl you will get the game<br />The way the game is that u can be a part of this game
B004WMKXWM|5.0|Can't wait for no2....Much darker than previous Harry Potter movies. Great from beginning till the end. I would definitely recommend this movie.
1616550414|4.0|Great quality of this book, i love it, the pictures, the info, the art of the games are very cool
0393064476|2.0|Very lightweight treatment and speculative.  Not a lot of substance and have no idea why this got any sort of award.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Best books I've read, ever. I can't imagine it being over! Leaves me wanting even more than they've given me.
B00123IAHO|5.0|Such a classic and it amazes me just how modern it sounds.  This is the real deal when it comes to street-wise 70s funk.
B009YL18RK|1.0|Boring and crude. Find some other way to waste two hours. You'll not miss anything by missing this Grade D film.
0307394549|5.0|I too have made many of the cookies in this cookbook.  I've uploaded photos of about 8 of them.  If you really want a sense of each cookie, google \\"Every Last Cookie\\" to find a blog by a young college girl who made all the cookies in this book and reviews each one.  She's a little crass and sassy, but seems to be reliable when it comes to taste and honesty.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Works well on the tablet. Not as much fun as full version but usable for the price. Good spare time fun.
1401323952|5.0|Photos uploaded with comments. Great go-to cookbook, everything you want in a cookbook for family and casual gatherings. My favorites are Speedy Seafood Supper, Banoffee Cheesecake, Apple-Cinnamon Muffins, and her version of Blondies. And of course her writing style - casual, entertaining, funny, informative.
B00AZQ4VMC|5.0|If you're just a 20's-30's Jazz lover, you'll love this, but if you're a ROXY MUSIC fan AND have a love for early jazz, this album will blow your mind.  Imagine &#34;Love is the Drug&#34; in an alternate universe where it was played at the Cotton Club instead of Studio 54.  Brilliantly odd, and endlessly listenable.  Genius.
B00003CWN3|5.0|Not a movie you would expect of Hilary Swank. You'd be amazed at how well she plays a girl with a gender identity crisis (dressing as a boy). This is based on a true event which is what compelled me to watch this.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|This was a good treatment of what is now called PTSD after WW II ,  but there were parts of the film that I couldn't seem to figure out the &#34;point&#34; (i.e. one scene where the women are at a cocktail party naked).  It's a bit &#34;dark&#34; and had many sub-plots.  Joaquin Phoenix was outstanding in his role and I though better than Philip Seymour Hoffman  who got the best actor nomination. It's worth watching, but I wouldn't watch it again.
B008D36INE|1.0|The first 15 minutes flashes around to so many different settings you have no idea what is going on. I'm not sure which makes me want to commit suicide more - the poorly done editing, the plot, or the fact that I wasted 100 minutes of my life on this drivel.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|There have been many &#34;remakes&#34; of Anna Karenina.. but this is by far the best.  It's a massive book with many characters and plot twists.  I think this movie captures all those nuances extremely well.  If I hadn't read the book it might have been a bit confusing in the beginning, but overall the film captures the essence of the book.  The acting is outstanding.  Highly recommend.
B0000DBJDM|2.0|More of an animated video and not concert footage. Probably my fault for not reading most of the reviews first. Very little live stuff and a few clips of studio footage but nothing impressive. I am a big Pink Floyd nut and have seen them twice in the post Waters years. Thought this might be my chance to see the band as it was.
B00499NHLC|5.0|We found this show because the first episode was available on Amazon Prime.  After watching A Study in Pink we bought Season 1and immediately watched The Blind Banker. They are entertaining and easy to follow because  the actors are easy for Americans to understand.
B004Y6MIXS|3.0|This particular model, the US036NHA, is significantly weaker than I had expected. I thought the Atheros would be comparable to Alfa's other adapters in this price range, but they are 1000mW adapters while this one is merely 500mW, which makes a big difference when pulling in distant signals.<br /><br />It's not *bad* by any stretch of the imagination, it's sturdy and sleek-looking (though the antenna always tips it over backwards) and perfectly serviceable for nearby wifi. Better than a dongle at least, and it has gotten a fair amount of use with no problems. However, Alfa and a few other brands sell similar models with twice the power for 2/3 the cost of this one.<br /><br />I'd advise against purchasing this model. A good 802.11g adapter beats a lackluster 802.11n adapter any day of the week, so get one of the similar 1000mW units. You can find a real firecracker of a wifi adapter for the same or less than this one.
B00AVPYT8I|1.0|So sorry that my Kindle fire wasn't able to download the required app. I was really looking forward to using this
B0015DYIH2|4.0|This final book maintains the personalities of the characters as the other 3 did throughout the series.  As always, Amazon delivers top quality products on time.  The 4 stars represent my preference for the series as less than my favorite, but I did enjoy the book.
1250006341|5.0|Since I have to wait for the series to start again, I'll be happily reading about all the characters and some of the behind the scenes information.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome, easy to use, easy to read and understand.  Love the way you can bookmark and make notes.  Highly reccomended.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|This book is a real life changer because it gives you the tools to learn new behaviors, that eventually will introduce change in all areas of life. The style is has very captivating storytelling, with lots of scientific data to back up the stories. I liked the progression from personal to organisational habits, and finally habits of societies. It presents a wealth of new data which can really help if you have any small or big habits that are annoying you or holding you back.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|One of the best calculators + that I have used.  Great for keeping up with mileage and costs while traveling
B007PF7MGS|5.0|In the recent years carbs have unfortunately gotten an bad reputation. This book is debunks the  myths of high-protein diets. There are loads of excellent recipes. If you start with Decadent Chocolate Pudding there is nothing to stop you from getting your weight and health under control.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is one of the best Bond Movies, Because I like the Action movies and this one lives up the billing.Very strong proformance by Daniel Craig, and M. Super video and Stunts. This goes alone the same lines of all Bond Movies thats what  makes them great, also like the extra that comes with the Blu Ray vldeo.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I am not a fan of books that move back and forth in time. I will say that this author handled it well
B005LAIIQC|5.0|These movies are for the people that like Action movies, and realise  that it is just a movie that is what we pay these actors for, a good movie and lots of action..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very interesting book ...ready to find out what happens in the new book :) This book leaves you wanting more !
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I buy these movies because the are a good story and have a lot of Action,The Actors did a great job of making this movie believable,But we all know that this is a movie.
B006FLGBGA|5.0|The title is awkward, but it serves as the gist of the plot. It's a restart of a franchise that began with Franklin Schaffner's Planet Of The Apes in 1968. Of course, by now, cinematic technology is such that the apes; every one of which is computer-generated using Weta Digital motion capture; look even more alive than they do in real life. The story itself, which revolves around a brain-enhancing retrovirus, isn't quite as believable, but it is thoroughly entertaining.<br /><br />This \\"Planet\\", by the way, isn't in some far-away galaxy. It's planet Earth. And the story is set during the present time. That means it's a given that these apes; physically stronger and genetically altered to be even more intelligent than humans; are going to take over as the rulers of the world. The suspense lies in how that happens, which begins with chimpanzees being hunted and captured in the Congo jungle and sold to pharmaceutical labs for testing.<br /><br />It's when the lead scientist; a man named Will Rodman; rescues a cute baby from being euthanized by taking it home with him; &agrave; la Gremlins; that things start to get interesting. It lives with him and his father, who's suffering from Alzheimer's; a disease the scientist proposes the experimental retrovirus might develop into a cure for; growing older and getting smarter, until something goes wrong and it has to be sent away to a sanctuary... with other apes.<br /><br />From there, it's an evolution revolution that leads to escape and quite an amazing movie climax. Yes, that final third or fourth is the best part as wild apes unite not necessarily to take over the world at this point but to free themselves from captivity. So they raid public places, causing mass hysteria; the zoos are a primary target; all the while exposing more and more apes to the brain-enhancing retrovirus; a process that itself spreads like a virus.<br /><br />There's an ape-versus-human showdown on The Golden Gate Bridge, where police set-up a barricade in an effort to stop the apes, but the police don't stand a chance. What the humans need, in order to preserve their status as the rulers of the world, is the military. And that, quite literally, means war; an interspecific war of the world.

B008Y5OWSO|4.0|It is a shame that Amazon does not better separate reviews for different release versions and formats of the same title.  Instead we see a jumble of reviewer analyses for different versions and formats, sorting them out ourselves by date and internal references.  Perhaps they might sort reviews by ASIN.<br /><br />The new (2013) Criterion DVD & Blu-Ray release is stated as \\"remastered\\", color adjusted to improve natural color balance, Widescreen 2.40:1 (according to Criterion, listed by Amazon as 1.77:1) , NTSC, w Surround Sound (Dolby Digital 5.1 according to NYT), Subtitles: English (only?).

Therefore I have concerns regarding change in color balance and widescreen ratio.<br /><br />If accurate, the ratio 1.77:1 would be achieved via \\"unmasking\\" the top and bottom of the original Panavision® frames.  \\"Letterbox\\" 2.35:1 is achieved simply by masking those areas. Criterion lists the current release ratio as 2.40:1 but Amazon lists the ratio as 1.77:1 and online video clips seem to be the latter.  It is unknown at this time which method was used to change the ratio.  IF unmasked, this is very good, we see more of the original frame.  But more usually, the sides of the wider format are just chopped off to fit the narrower ratio; this is a very bad loss of the original Panavision® frame area.<br /><br />Being \\"anamorphic\\" makes no difference, it just adjusts whatever ratio is used to better fit modern 16x9 wide screens as if full frame.<br /><br />I understood the concept of original sepia toned color balance first used.

It includes a refreshing perspective, sufficient reference to research supporting his ideas, and great stories that bring his concepts alive.  Reading this has caused me to take action in my work.  It will be mandatory reading for my executive team- the books arrive on Tuesday for my team.  (The book gets rolling and very engaging about 50 pages in - stick with it)

B00BSBUZT6|4.0|I first caught this documentary on the Showtime channel in one setting (Parts 1 & 2).  It was originally broken down in 2 parts.  The first part shows the band members in their formative years and ends with their eventual breakup in 1980.  The shorter part 2 deals with their lives afterwards, ending with their Farewell 1 Tour in 2005.  Together the film runs a little over 3 hours.  Certainly for Eagle fans, it is time well spent.  Even if you're not a fan, it chronicles the seeds of a rock band in the 1970's.<br /><br />The early lives of writing partners Don Henley and Glenn Frey is well detailed including some interesting home videos.  We see an early association with Jackson Browne and a brief time backing up Linda Ronstdat.  We get a no holds barred look at the inner turmoil that comes with the growth of a rock band.  We see the early comings and goings of band members leading up to a bitter breakup with lead guitarist Don Felder.<br /><br />One thing that comes through is the success of the group has transcended generations like few others.  Their strength comes from some great song writing, often at the hand of Henley and Frey and some of the great 4 or 5 part vocal harmony.  We get some first person detail of booze and drug binges, especially those of Joe Walsh.<br /><br />So what's missing?  Well, certainly family and wives are tipped toed around and we see virtually nothing of them.  We don't any of the juicy sexy-time stories which are all but ignored.  How about some celebrity union stories?  Still this is an entertaining journey through the lives of one of America's musical treasures.<br /><br />Available in April, the Blu ray package includes 3 discs in 1080p video resolution with a DTS-HD Master Audio option.  Also included is a photo booklet and hours of new, previously unreleased material.  Also included on the 3rd disc (which I haven't seen) is 1977 concert performances from the Capital Centre in Landover, Md.

B0093BUWGE|3.0|Jose James has had a good run, his band are quite amazing. Especially live they come across as he real deal and deliver the goods with every track. It's just that this album is not as interesting as the last few. The first album 'Dreamer' was a knockout and some of the remix material was good, especially the work with Flying Lotus.
B00439ONA2|1.0|I never got the movie to watch!!! I think I've been riped off by this jurk and I'm tired of people like this!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like the simplicity of this app.  Fun for a quick game.  I find myself trying to follow all the goals in this one.
B00AQL8VU4|2.0|I guess if you absolutely have to buy one or two items, this app is perfect, but it won't allow u to change shipping options, or certain other key features like u can online.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|when I first got this app which was about Jan '13 I thought it was such a great fun game. But now I absolutely hate it. I cannot expand my territory which pretty much killed it for me. withouth expanding you cannot gather supplies such as wood etc. All of my buildings are literally wall to wall. Idk how many of my pioneers have died already due to no medicine due to no &quot;wood&quot;. its pretty much a done deal. I do not recommend this app to anyone because its pointless,<br /> but hey ill let u decide for yourself.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|i loved this game.  when you play the &quot;download&quot; free part of the app, it really sucks you into the story line and doesn't dissapoint once you pay for the rest...

B00AFEXRME|4.0|I was thoroughly surprised by \\"Flight\\".<br /><br />I thought it was going to be a movie about a plane crash and its repercussions. But this is the backstory for a movie about redemption and grace. We see three characters who are addicted to substances. One unfortunately, never gets the chance to recover, however in her final act of saving a passenger from dying, did something magnificent. Another, has the courage to tackle it head on, acknowledge her weakness and seek help. And then we have the third, played by Denzel Washington. For the majority of the movie he refuses to accept his addiction even though he is powerless to stop its grip on him.<br /><br />Some tremendous acting by Denzel and Kelly Reilly. An outstanding support cast. Even Melissa Leo's fleeting appearance at the end was powerful in her compassion for Denzel when he finally admits his struggle. She sees a broken man, but one who's courageous act in admitting his addiction is able to start the \\"flight\\" to freedom.<br /><br />Very powerful. And I'd encourage you to watch it.
0345472322|1.0|I heard multiple good things about this book and was excited to start reading it. However its been 3 weeks and still hasnt arrived and when you try to contact the distributor... no response!! Disappointed in general.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is extremely well written,  but I did not like either of the two main characters at all.  I will still give it five stars.  I usually like to like one of the main characters in a book or at last feel some empathy for a main character.  Those two were totally &#34;nuts&#34; in my opinion and I did not like either!  Although I felt this way, I kept being surprised by the changing events in the story line.  You would go &#34;Wow, I didn't see that coming!&#34;
B0076DELIG|4.0|I would like to see this guy in a series or movie, for the same reasons stated in my rating
B0000DZEA1|5.0|When you watch the movie you often forget the music involved and that is a sign of a good composer.  Even alone as in this CD you are moved by the same feelings and they bring back the sweeping landscape of the last book of the trilogy and ends in the beautiful Into the West by Annie Lennox, which is unforgetable, and still can bring emotions to the surface of the joy and sorrow all in one of the passing over to a new realm beyond the world we know.  Unforgettable and sweeping is my comment, beyond is hyperbole.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's fun and easy to do. Some levels are difficult but it is very addictive. One of the best games out there.
B00BMVTTJ4|3.0|Looks like a home video at 48 fps and 24 fps.  It's too sharp... I can see gandolph's eyeliner.  At least at 24 fps the movements seem more natural.  It takes time to put these issues aside and get into the story, which is boring and indulging for the first hour.  The second half of the movie is redeemable to an extent.

B00A2H9LK6|5.0|Silent Hill was an original and highly atmospheric horror film about a bizarre civilization occupying an abandoned West Virginia coal mining town with perpetually burning underground fires.  The movie had an enigmatic ending with the mom and adopted daughter seemingly alive and in the process of returning to their home but in a weird cloudy dimension with constantly falling ash from the underground fires.  The husband/dad was unable to see and communicate with them, and vice versa.  The sequel, Silent Hill: Revelation, is a true sequel, picking up where  Silent Hill left off and featuring most of the same characters (or their relatives).  As in the original, the sequel features dramatic special effects highlighting the strange and alien enviornment of the town of Silent Hill.  I liked this sequel and anyone who enjoyed the original Silent Hill will enjoy this movie.

B0020M99LC|3.0|I thought from other reviews that this movie would be exciting and interesting.  I actually was bored and had a hard time following even this thin plot.  This movie, apart from Daniel Craig's fine appearance, did not hold my interest.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|The twitter ap on my phone isn't great but this one is more like the one on my computer so it's much easier to use.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|The acting is over the top, but that's not the problem with this movie.  The book's storyline can support the teenage angst portrayed by the lovely actors.  The editing renders the main storyline at the high school completely irrelevant, with the antagonist magically changing sides at the end of the movie, with no explanations!
B000FC13Y0|3.0|This book was not exactly what I wad expecting. I was expecting to be more like the movie of the same name. Usually books which are adapted for the screen are my chin better than the movie but in this case I believe kg not to be so. This book, while creative and cute, is not filled with as much action and fun as I was hoping for. This is the first of Neil Bauman's books that I have read so I will probably give him another chance to wow me through another one of his novels before I pass too much judgment.
B00181MHQU|5.0|Loved the singing, choreography, and music.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who loves the old musicals.<br />West Side Story is fantastic.

B002ZTIIXK|5.0|Fabulous double CD!  Amazing voices and the songs are a great choice for her voice.  My first CD by her and I am so impressed!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is a straightforward, simple story that could have gotten away with resting solely on the buddy movie setup: rich, stuffy disabled white guy comes to life because of big, uncouth black guy from the (French) 'hood.  But these two amazing actors make &#34;The Intouchables&#34; so much more interesting and honest than that. It's the story of a friendship that makes both men into good men -- but with the emotional ride of a love story. The scene where Driss comes back to Phillipe and knocks on the window in the middle of the night is one of the best reunion moments you'll ever see.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I hadn't seen a Bond movie since Goldfinger. I absolutely loved the film, so much so , that I purchased the complete set of bond movies
B00B7FXZQS|2.0|No longer scary.  Nothing really happened except for the times you saw something flash by in the corner. No dark shadows, no door or cabinets fly open. A ball bounces down the steps. Oh boy. Plus it brought up so many questions. I'd list them, but don't want to ruin anything for someone who hasn't watch the film yet, and still would like to. In my opinion, no longer scary, no longer much suspense, just a waste of time.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Epic Adventures: Cursed Onboard, is a fantastic game for all ages.Finding the objects isn't that easy for the older generation, yet it's not too hard for the younger participants.(this is the first time I`'ve played a game that suits all ages.)<br />The small games are neither too hard nor too easy,again being open to all the generations.<br />The only problem I have discovered is in this Hidden Object game, is sometimes an item to be found is under the bar with hidden objects on! This makes it sometimes impossible to reach hidden item and gain necessary item for inventory and that makes it impossible to open next part of puzzle! Does anyone have any idea's

0440237688|4.0|Louis Lowry has created a utopian society where life is \\"perfect.\\" They have never known love or any other emotions. I thought the this book brought an interesting concept of society. I would recommend this book to a middle schooler, but not to children in elementary school. They bring up ideas such as lust, death, suicide and other harsh concepts. However, it does give a new idea of life. Would it be better if you had no sorrow, but no love. I enjoyed reading about what the main characters thoughts were on this. It was moderately written and was a page turner at times. However, I feel that she cut the book off too early. I wanted more details about how his society functioned. I liked how she had humans in the future, but she still had it seem like a fantasy. It was the right balance between fantasy and reality. I give it a four star out of five.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Riviting, I watched it twice. I waited until the price went down on prime. It was hard to wait. It was excellent.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|I was impressed with Mystic River. Being a fan of Sean Penn's earliest work, Taps and Fast Times at Ridgemont High, he absolutely blew away expectations in his role. Robbins also does well as his best role since Andy Defrense. A fair warning though, the movie is very sad and depressing and there a no real feel-good moments. Despite this, Mystic River is brilliant.<br /><br />Acting: 4 1/2 stars (Penn is Superb, Robbins is great, and Bacon keeps up. Other charecters are fairly forgettable)<br />Plot: 4 1/2 stars (Deep and thought provoking. Very dark. The only problem is Linney's speech at the end is a little off)<br />Production: 4 stars (Nothing special, nothing to complain about)<br />Overall: 4 1/2 stars (The acting and story make this film a critic's dream)
1432794426|5.0|Karen Moriarty has written a compassionate portrayl of Michael Jackson's life & legacy. Her passion and empathy for Micheal is a comfort for the reader, as so many lies have been told about this kind gentle genius. Michael was a wouded soul who only wanted to Heal the World to make it a better place for all of us. Defending a King in its own way is healing for him, and those who have loved and defended him for so long. The truth must be told and Karen Moriarty tells it at last!
B000QUCNP4|3.0|I checked this movie out because I liked Gylenhall in Donnie Darko and it got decent reviews. After viewing however, the entire story leaves the audience bored. The story of the Zodiac killer is pretty interesting, but there is too much boring trhow-away dialouge between charecters that don't develope into anything special. The last half hour is pretty good as it wraps up the story nice, but there isn't much to wrap up.<br /><br />Acting: 3 star (Gylenhall is ok. Rufalo is unlikable. I am not a fan of Robert Downey Jr, but his performance was the strongest)<br />Plot: 3 star (Again, a good story in real life that is executed in a slow, predictable manner)<br />Production: 3 1/2 star (the Zodiac killing scenes are pretty cool, but most of the movie is spent in a generic police station or following a mundane Gylenhall)<br />Overall: 3 star (Maybe worth watching if on TV, but probably not worth the buy)
B00701897I|4.0|This was more of an impulsive purchase but no regrets here. It is an amazing movie with great animation. Kudos.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|This movie is a fairly well done adaptation of the Phantom of the Opera, typically performed on the stage.  I mainly ordered it because I am a huge Gerard Butler fan and was curious about how he would do in a musical.  His portrayal of the Phantom was well done.  I thought the casting was very well done.  Mr. Butler does not have a beautiful operatic voice, but that is not what his role called for so he cannot be judged harshly for it.  This movie IS a musical.  there is no spoken dialogue.  The story line is rather trite and a bit schmaltzy, but enjoyable nonetheless.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Entertaining to say the least. Its a good way to kill time. Just that I do not have all that time to kill :)
0375842209|5.0|Various people have been trying to get me to read this book for years and I finally picked it up at the library last week.  After finishing it, I can see why many of my friends liked it so much.  It is the tale of Liesel Meminger, who is a young foster child growing up in Nazi Germany during World War II. The book is unusual in that the narrator is Death.<br /><br />The Book Thief is both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. This book will bring a smile to your face at times and at other times, leave you on the verge of tears. I am convinced that history will compare this book to classics such as as To Kill a Mockingbird, Great Expectations, and The Grapes of Wrath.

B00B23O96A|3.0|I love Eric Clapton, but this sounds more like a cross between Conway Twitty and Bob Marley. There are a few decent moment on this CD, but overall I say, there are better Clapton albums.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|Roy Orbison is classic. The range in his vocals is a rarity among singers past and present. He sings so effortlessly that you can't help but love his voice and his music. He is definitely one of the greats!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Great surprise.  Should be watched in HD with all the great scenes that Eng puts into the movie.  Teaches good life lessons too.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I am not going to write a lengthy review, because I am not good at it.  I just wanted to say that every part of this movie was beautiful.  The love for nature, the love for God, the innocence, and the love for animals drew me in.  It was a story about keeping faith in stormy weather, when most would give up, enduring until the end when promises will be fulfilled.  I loved every bit of it.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|This app is the absolute worst.  It is solo skewed and is truly the biggest ripoff.  Slow network connections are the norm.  Funny how no other app I have is so affected.  Then there are the big fish snobs who have millions of chips and think they are too good tor you.  Couple that with the obvious big fish (card ace) &quot;moles&quot; and it just doesn't add up.  They need to be turned into better business bureau.  Social network - I think not!  Do yourself a favor and don't get involved. Would give it zero stars if I could. YUK
0525478817|5.0|Every concept I've ever had has been blown away by this amazing book. It's a hilarious-heartbreaking-tear inducing-smile producing-mind altering-love story that has nothing to do with you but everything to do with anything you've ever felt, ever thought,  ever known. This book captures the very essence of life in its portrayal of death and his colleagues: sickness and health, pain and emptiness, and absolutely everything in between. The description on the upside flap of the book can not prepare you for the \\"roller coaster ride\\" of emotion you're going to experience. Just sit back, get comfortable, and then immerse yourself into the world of Hazel and Augustus, allow your mind and theirs to intertwine, and then fall in love again and again.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case is definitely worth the money.  Compared to all of the others, this one is the best hands down!  No complaints.  I carry my kindle everywhere and I know it's always safe in this case.
0553801473|5.0|Son has enjoyed this book series. He recommends this book to readers. Plot is great and said ending was awesome!
B004V9MU86|4.0|Great read to the very end - very captivating could read more ....suitable for a variety of readers and ages ...
1250010403|1.0|I find it hard to believe that Jeffrey Archer can base a whole plot on the possibility of an illegitimate son inheriting a title.  That does not and would not happen.  That put me off reading any more of this series, which in any case I found very long-winded.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|This book is amazing I'm a zombie fanatic thanks Max Brooks and world war z was also a good book I believe those stories all the way
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I LIKED LEARNING ABOUT THE INCIDENTS LEADING UP TO THE SECOND WORLD WAR. THE STORY LINE ABOUT THE FAMILIES INVOLVED WAS VERY GOOD.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|really enjoy playing this game I find it speaks to my friend and I find the very addicting have fun with it
B000ZK4T98|3.0|The movie itself was fantastic.  The condition of the case is another story.  I received the movie with a dent in the case and a  noticeable scratch on the case.  I also found a finger print on the dvd, which was suppose to be new.  Scratching my head on that one.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very good book. Could not put it down. I have read all of the books this was the best. Love it
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its good but not as fast as temple run 1 and #1 didn't have gems. like this one did. oh and this verision has 1 demon monkey instead of 3 or 4
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|It is just as fun as temple run.  The only thing. It doesn't have as different characters as the tmplern game.
0440423023|5.0|I have enjoyed all of these books & have read all of them I can get my hands on. Waiting for more kindle versions.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|What a vivid imagination Andy Weir has! \\"The Martian\\" is fast paced fun that, while being a little too heavy on the math at times, quickly moves the hero from one critical, near-death problem to the next.<br /><br />I say \\"the hero,\\" but really he's a geeky, crude, and ultimately likeable guy who is forced to invent solutions to all kinds of problems while stranded on Mars. He is not a typical hero at all, which gives the story real energy.<br /><br />A great book for YA readers and grownups too, \\"The Martian\\" hums with the irreverent longing for space adventure.
B003OUXECE|5.0|I read this book after having played both Bioshock 1 and 2 and this book filled in all the little things wonderfully. It was also nice to see how, and why, Rapture was even made in the first place.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|As several reviewers note, there's an irony here in that Chess Records persuaded Muddy Waters to do an acoustic album with \\"folk\\" in the title in order to appeal to the same folks who were buying Peter, Paul, and Mary, and the Kingston Trio.  Soon after, Dylan would come along and make categories like \\"folk\\" and \\"blues\\" seem a bit unnecessarily rigid!  What Muddy does here is blues, but blues IS \\"a\\" folk music -- it just isn't what \\"folk\\" meant in 1963.  This is a fine album -- I like the spare accompaniment of Buddy Guy and Willie Brown on the original tracks (there are some bonuses on the CD, recorded the following year with additional personnel -- also good), and the quality of Muddy's voice and his singing come through well.  \\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\\" is done with a nice sinister flavor.  \\"Big Legged Woman\\" is marvelous (very different from Sonny Terry and Brownie McGee), and both \\"Long Distance\\" and \\"Feel Like Goin' Home\\" are poignant.  Of the bonus tracks, there's a great \\"Short Dress Woman\\" and \\"You Can't Lose What you Never Had,\\" and the odd and humorous \\"My John the Conqueror Root.\\"  Sound quality is just fine throughout -- a very welcome reissue.
B009O07NDY|2.0|I pre-orded this for Christmas for my Dad, who loved the LOTR soundtrack (so did I).  However, we went to see the movie a few days before Christmas and were not impressed with the majority of the music; most of it was just more LOTR stuff.  The only original song was Far Over, which is great, but you can get this on iTunes for a buck.<br /><br />I sent this CD back post-haste and got my dad a math book instead (haters gonna hate...)
B00A4AI19I|5.0|Even though I own, on separate CDs, all that is in this box, I'm STILL tempted to buy it at the price!  There is probably no more desirable or satisfying Brahms set, despite the fact that most of the recording was done in the late 1950's.  The word sometimes applied to Klemperer's Brahms is \\"craggy\\" -- and I think that is partly because the sound, though present, clear, and well-balanced, isn't glamorous.  Also, it's because Klemperer's rhythmic alertness doesn't let you want to linger as you listen -- he moves along with great cogency, and yet each symphony emerges with its own character, because Klemperer trusts the music and trusts his orchestra and his instincts.  In some more recent digital versions, you'll hear more of the inner voices of the piece, and that's very nice, but the heartbeat has to be there, and Klemperer gets you to it.  I like all the work here -- I think the German Requiem recording has never been bettered as an interpretation, with Schwarzkopf and Fischer-Dieskau at their peaks, and Klemperer refusing to sentimentalize.  The First Symphony is gloriously rendered, and the Second and Third are great too.  For me, the Fourth is the touchstone: this is the Fourth by which I measure the others I hear, and it's simply amazing that it was recorded in 1956 and 1957. The sound shows its age a bit -- the strings a little whistle-y -- but the whole thing is perfectly balanced, and the sound is airy and present. I'm reminded of Maag's great Mendelssohn Third (on Decca) from the same year. So credit Walter Legge and Douglas Larter, his sound man, for getting the sound right. But even more credit to Klemperer, whose pacing of the symphony makes it more engaging and even exciting than any other I've heard so far. Although often criticized for taking things too slowly, Klemperer here is faster than other conductors, and in the first movement that gives it a sense of both momentum and coherence: the transitions seem just right, because Klemperer convinces you that he knows where he's going. If I'm not mistaken, he picks up the pace just a bit at the end of the movement, and he drives it home excitingly. The two inner movements have an almost Mendelssohnian flavor to them -- the little dance-figure with a kick in the scherzo, and the phrasing of the first theme in the slow movement. The slow movement has two gorgeous melodies that are related to each other, and Klemperer realizes that he doesn't have to convince his hearer that they're beautiful -- so he trusts them and doesn't linger, and the effect is enlivening. The final movement is, like the first, taken at a good pace, and the variations seem to grow out of one another very naturally. There are times when we're reminded of the third movement in some of the brass figures, and the \\"slow\\" variations are grippingly done, before Klemperer moves confidently to the end. This is a Fourth to cherish in a boxed set to cherish.that he knows where he's going.

034580404X|5.0|Good for a light before-bed reading. I enjoyed all three books, and they were not at all what I was expecting. Actually much better read than I would have thought.
B009B2VBWE|3.0|This album represents a country and western departure for Diana Krall. I preferred her singing the standards and her own unique pieces
B0056TYT66|5.0|Bought this to add USB III ports and a couple more SATA ports to a video server (Windows 2008R2 64bit on an ASUS P7P55 LX mobo).  Originally I had issues with the card not allowing the server to boot, actually corrupting the boot sequence once.  Long story short, I forgot I had an old SIIG SATA 150 card installed (nothing connected to it, so I overlooked it) that was conflicting with this Transcend card.  Removed the SIIG card and the server booted fine.  One thing i DID do first, however, was download and install the USB and SATA drivers for this card (you'll need the serial number off the card to get the correct driver) before installing the card...  that way, the OS already has the drivers when it boots with the card installed.<br /><br />If I need another SATA/USB card, I'll purchase this one if they're still available.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Cant get enough<br /><br />There are plausible explanations for his great skills<br /><br />Only one part where someone beat him - I didn't accept that episode.<br />More episodes confirm my suspicions; there is no way he should have gotten his butt kicked.<br /><br />Other than that inconsistency, the filming, the stories and the interleaving of the past with future are first class.
B00008438V|5.0|I have always loved this movie and so glad to finally own it!!! It didn't skip like the other movies I got from Amazon and was just perfect. No special features though which sucks but oh well I still love this movie!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is a great movie, the story is amazing, the picture is incredible, the special effects are great. It is a great movie that worth every penny on it.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this movie, it has a deep message for everyone.<br /><br />Thanks

B00422LESO|2.0|[[ASIN:B00422LESO Austenland]]<br />I expected a light romance with a Jane Austen finish. I didn't care for this book because of the author breaking away from the story to talk about Jane's former boyfriends. Nothing against the author, it's just not my type of book.
B004I744AS|5.0|I was surprised how easy it was  to use and you can't beat the price. Would recommend this to anyone.

B000JQU1VS|4.0|and I don't think I should have to fill out more words it is ridiculous to require a certain number of words just to get rid of this box
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a fun set of mini games... but it does take a while to unlock some games but it is a good time passer.
0307895475|5.0|this has EVERYTHING in it!! My jaw nearly hit the floor when i saw how thick the book was.  But in the short time i have had it it has helped me greatly.

B003VS0CWO|5.0|This was everything i expected it would be when i got it from my husband as a gift for christmas.  The only thing about the item that disappointed me was that the book displayed in the picture IS the case for the disc.  Other then that i give this a 5 star because the movie is great and it is a favorite to watch in my home.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Be prepared to cry. You will love the main characters as well as the secondary ones. I was cheering for everyone's success. Again, no worries about delivery, I have a Kindle.
B006CHML4I|5.0|Thats what I said.<br /><br />Its a great watch. excellent build quality. Its only 36mm or something. I wish it was about 40mm. It will look a bit small on most wrists.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I am catching up to everyone else in the Walking Dead series. I just ordered season 2, just watching the first season helps explain parts of the third.
1616960922|5.0|This book is short and sweet. It's compelling - just goes to show how a single idea can transform into an amazing story.<br />This is exactly what i would expect from my favorite author and the reason I keep going back to his works for more.<br /><br />Some of his other works that I've enjoyed are - Elantris, The way of kings, Alcatraz and the Mistborn series. From WOT series - 'the towers of midnight' and 'gathering storm' stand out - 'memory of light' - not so much. But I can't complain he's the best sci-fi author around and his mediocre books are way better than other's best :)
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|I was introduced to Gary Clark Jr. through the &#34;Rocksmiths Guitar and Bass&#34; game software.  After ordering and playing his song &#34;Bright Lights&#34; to play along with in my Rocksmiths program, I just had to order his total mp3 album.  And may I say, &#34;I was not disappointed.&#34;  Rocksmiths turned me onto Gary Clark Jr.  I am now a new fan and highly recommend you and everyone else giving Gary Clark Jr. a listen.  He's creative with a great range of talent that cannot be pigeon holed.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to like this book or hate it. Those seemed to be the reactions of most people who have read this trilogy, love or hate.  All of the BDSM elements aside, the book is a real study of what kind of coping mechanisms damaged people employ to stay in control of their demons. Christian Grey has certainly got his fair share of emotional issues. I liked that Ana cared enough about him to dig below the surface and try to understand the why of his needs, but I also like that she kept enough self esteem to say, \\" this just isn't me\\".  Ana has her own issues with confidence and belief in herself.  I did enjoy reading this author and am interested to see how the story continues. The book is sexually explicit and definitely for the grown ups.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|These guys are hip and current.  This is another band that I was introduced to through my &#34;Rocksmiths Guitar and Bass&#34; game software.  I enjoyed playing their songs so much, that I had to download their CD for my mp3 player.  I will definitely be keeping up with this band.  They are totally cool, hip, and just plain current with a touch of nostalgia.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I liked this book because of its promised content, but also because it was a short but through review of actions which help in all relationships.  Good one to review frequently to enhance friendships, making new ones or improving on current ones.  This is recommended as a valuable,<br />easy read with lots of common sense.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Addicting.  Took a chance downloading this on a lazy day and the rest is history.  No crash problems, great graphics, love the tasks the stable hands give.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favorite game on my kindle fire. It is soo addicting to play and is sooooo much fun!!!!!!!
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|Glad to see the enthusiasm to Tolkien writings - read the books at least a dozen times many years ago - and waited just about half a life time for it to be made into a movie.<br /><br /> The title reflects my opinion of a lack of following to the book. Why I do not understand it. Was expecting a close to the book rendition as was almost done with the Lord of the Rings books.<br /><br /> If you did read the book the Hobbit: The initial meeting with Gandalf whilst Bilbo was enjoying his pipe out doors was in the reading a comedy - as Gandalf is really not portrayed as seriously as the movie depicts - especially with the arrival of the Dwarves - each with their colored hoods could have been done better. This seemed to be a lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Director/Producer. There are other disappointments I noted but the most obvious is the part with Radagast the Brown with the Spiders which did NOT occur in the book and was not interesting at all - nearly fell asleep at the theatre. The other is the interpretation of the encounter with the Orcs in the cave. If you know how to read it states Bilbo DREAMED the floor of the cave fell away and saw the attack of the Orcs.The book reads - Bilbo saw a part (key words a part of) of his dream was in fact happening with the Orcs rushing in -bla, bla accuracy to the book is what makes a movie a solid hit. I do realize YOU NEW followers to Tolkeins story has resulted into an over-enthusiastic acceptance of the movie as created. But clearly (YAWN)it missed the mark by a long shot.<br /> Sorry to say - I may or may NOT purchase the extended version when it is released. Yes their will be as money will be made to soak as much from YOU as possible. Initial version, then extended then some form of HD, Blu-ray or whatever - money makes the world go 'round!!!<br /> Can't wait to come back to see the 241 of you complain you should have waited.
B00138J6VM|5.0|Ah, the glory days of Aerosmith. I was 12 years young when I first bought this album and it was the very first Aerosmith album I ever owned! Wore out the grooves!<br />This was Aerosmith's third album and a breakthrough one as well for the group, thanks in part to &#34;Walk This Way&#34; and &#34;Sweet Emotion.&#34;<br />Their first four albums (Aerosmith, Get Your Wings, TITA and Rocks) were able to combine great melodies with a hard edge! (Brad Whitford, after all, was a Berklee College Of Music graduate!) I very often find myself humming these songs long after I listen to them.<br />From the accelerating title track to the album's sorrowful closer, &#34;You See Me Crying&#34; (the first time the group ever included strings!), this album is good to the last drop.<br />The first time I ever saw the movie, Dazed and Confused, when it begins with &#34;Sweet Emotion&#34; during the opening credits, I knew I was gonna love that movie...and I did! Perfectly captures that era well with the use of that song...and it ends with the main characters on their way to buy Aerosmith tickets!<br />This is an album that still excites me to this day.
B000N5F6OW|5.0|Nice to see John Wayne not riding a horse or wearing a holster...Henry Mancini at the top of his game for music.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|A long-awaited release from FA! Thank God she decided not to repeat herself and make another carbon copy of Extraordinary Machine! This time around, she uses more vocal dynamics, percussion, lower-keyed piano notes, multi-tracked vocals and sound effects! On the final track, &#34;Hot Knife,&#34; there's no piano at all...first time ever on an FA song! This is one of those albums that's gets better with each listening. Welcome back, Fiona! You were missed!
B00BMVTS1S|2.0|Disappointed.  I had high hopes for this movie and couldn't wait for it to come out.  If you've never read the Hobbit then there is a lot to like about the movie.  The cinematography is great with lots of action, although it had a bit of a Goonies feel to it.  That being said, if you are a real fan of the book, you will probably be disappointed.  The Hobbit is a great story and I didn't feel it needed embellishment or changes to the story. I felt like they decided to change the story and then as an after thought throw in some lines from the book. I'm actually sorry I purchased the movie and I won't be watching the next installments of the story.
B000VXJMYG|5.0|1979...Disco and New Wave were ruling the music world and, yet, Supertramp releases an album that defies all genres! Their previous album, Even in the Quietest Moments..., put them on the musical map, thanks to their breakthrough U.S. single, &#34;Give a Little Bit.&#34; But, Breakfast in America was their watershed album...and deservedly so! Went all the way to #1 on May 19, 1979 (yes, I'm a chart geek!) and it stayed there, on and off, for a total of 6 weeks! It generated three singles, which STILL get airplay today: &#34;The Logical Song,&#34; &#34;Goodbye Stranger&#34; (which was cleverly used in an episode of &#34;The Office&#34;) and &#34;Take the Long Way Home.&#34; The remaining seven tracks are all gems, too! &#34;Gone Hollywood&#34; is a cynical/satirical view of fame in Hollyweird. (&#34;...so many creeps in Hollywood...&#34;) The title song is very catchy with some great tuba playing. &#34;Oh Darling&#34; is one of those falling-apart-but-I'll-get-you-back-whatever-it-takes songs. &#34;Lord Is It Mine&#34;...beautiful. &#34;Just Another Nervous Wreck&#34; is a song I can relate to from time to time. (That line about not affording a pen to sign a check still makes me laugh every time I hear it!) &#34;Casual Conversations&#34;...one of the best songs ever written about lack of communication. &#34;Child Of Vision&#34;...could easily be written today!<br />And, the album cover is unique, too! A waitress posing as The Statue Of Liberty, with a menu and a glass of orange juice on a saucer, replacing the book and torch. She is seen from an airplane window, with kitchenware being used as skyscraper buildings.<br />Originally, the cover was on gonna be Corn Flakes and milk flowing downward, like Niagra Falls! THAT would've been interesting!<br />Having previously owned this on vinyl, cassette and CD, it was great to purchase it again on here...and it still sounds fresh today! Well worth every penny!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful story of courageous young woman who starts over but has to constantly look over her shoulder.  Love the way Sparks sheds light on the subject of domestic violence.  I wanted to reach through the pages and help her!!!<br /><br />The story of a young father who has to continue after the loss of his wife also is so emotional.  Sparks weaves these two characters together and leaves his readers breathless!  Wonderful story that will leave you wanting more!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Out of sight, out of mind, they say, and I'd have to agree. After hearing his music over 40 years ago, I got busy with the normalcy of living my life and didn't wonder what happened to his remarkable talent. Thanks to the publicity surrounding the documentary, &#34;Searching for Sugarman,&#34; I rediscovered Rodriguez and am so glad I did. His music is at once scathing and sublime, and listening to him again reminded me of the beauty that pulled me to his first album (yes, I bought the ALBUM those many years ago, stop your giggling!) &#34;Cold Fact,&#34; but I didn't even know that he made a second. This is a treasure that at least equals his first, so buy it! If you don't have &#34;Cold Fact&#34; buy them both, you can't go wrong.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book that was hard to put down. I loved it. A very easy and quick read and now I appreciate the movie so much more!
B007REV4YI|5.0|The script and direction for Skyfall are particularly literate for the genre.  Bardem is amazing.  The weak points are Craig, who is strangely wooden compared to his Casino Royale debut, and the Bond girls don't have much to do.  Even so, this ranks as one of the best Bond films since the early Connery days.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just finished this book yesterday and I absolutely loved it...and really the entire series. All of these books were very quick and easy reads, I could not put them down. This final installment was by far my favorite, full of action and adventure and it was wonderful to see how things finally ended up with Katniss. I am happy for the closure but hate to say goodbye to the series!

0743270754|3.0|Like all Americans these last few years I too am caught up in the Resurrection of Lincoln.<br />Years ago I read Gore Vidal's \\"Lincoln\\" and found that to be wildly entertaining and ellucidating.  But now I wanted more.<br /><br />I suppose the resurgence began with O'Reilly, but I hate O'Reilly so would not buy HIS book.  But then there was a movie by Robert Redford which dealt with the conspiracy to KILL Lincoln, which really roused my curiousity.  This led to \\"The Lincoln Conspiracy\\" which was a totally FANTASTIC (read FAKE) read.  But even this led to a greater interest in the truth.<br /><br />So my next step was to see the movie....Speilberg was inspired when he hired Kushner to write the film and to focus on just those four months.  I always knew I would read the book eventually.<br /><br />THEN: \\"The Life of Abraham Lincoln.\\" by Henry Ketcham, was available for FREE on Kindle.  And I was not just a fan or admirerer, I was awestruck and perhaps a little lovesick.  (please read Ketcham's book)<br /><br />FINALLY - I got to \\"Team of Rivals\\" ... and was disappointed. (I really really wanted to like it)  I hoped it would bring life to history in the order of McCullough, but then that is why McCullough is who he is.<br /><br />Ketcham tells in great detail how the boy grew to a man, and all the kind acts he performed and generous deeds he administered.  Ketcham also includes many of the letters and speeches Lincoln wrote and read.  This book A FREE BOOK gave a sense of the man and politician. (free because it was written some few decades after the murder of Lincoln)<br /><br />Goodwin - she writes like a College Lecturer.  There is no warmth in the stories she tells, and her backdrop pales when compared to that given by Ketcham. Even little stories she tells (the borrowing and ruin of a book on George Washington) lack the humor captured by Ketcham. To be fair Goodwin is focused on \\"THE RIVALS\\" so much time is given to Bates, Chase, Seward and Stanton.<br /><br />\\"Team of Rivals\\" is the perfect title for this book.  If you want to read about Five Men of the time, enjoy this book.<br />If you want to know LINCOLN - read Ketcham and Vidal...and then continue through infinity...<br /><br />BTW - I have to add that the ONE VERY STRIKING strength of imagery in this book is treatment of slaves \\"Matilda\\" the slave and daughter of her owner..(ouch) and Bates' female slave ran off to Cananda \\"her three daughters were promptly sold.\\"  (anguish)  Makes one wonder how all those boys could go to war to defend slavery...sickening as the war was, Slavery is still more sickening.<br /><br />So - in close I will say that this book is a hit only because of the success of the film and the resurgence of Licoln as a popular figure.  Otherwise it is the driest of textbooks.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|Another great BBC series.  I was sad to see it come to an end.  I would recommend if you liked Little House on the Prairie type shows.

B003O86FMW|4.0|I was not disappointed with the 2nd installment of this series. The story line was entertaining and the plot kept me interested. I was prepared to be disappointed but was pleasantly surprised. The cliffhanger ending makes me want to actually read the third installment of The Hunger Games series instead of just watching the movie.

B0011UBDTK|1.0|My wife loves SITS however,we had to return 2 complete sets as the same 2 disks were defective in the same spot, and that was terribly disappointing. Both disks had some kind of swirl marks on them which rendered them unreadable. I tried 2 different players to verify (both Sony Blu-rays) and no good.<br /><br />Sorry to say we have not ordered it again.
0345403959|4.0|There are many who recommend reading Belgarath the Sorcerer only after you have read the Belgariad and the Mallorean series.  However, David Eddings isn't one of them. In a foreword to the 2005 publication of Malloreon, Eddings tells us that \\"the reader can go directly from the end of Polgara to the beginning of Pawn.\\"  And before Polgara there was, of course Belgarath.  He is, after all, her father.<br /><br />In any event, that is exactly the order in which I am reading the series and, truth be told, it has not spoiled it for me one bit.  For Belgarath's story is the story of a man who has lived for seven thousand years for a very specific purpose.  That sort of thing is bound to give you a rather different perspective than (say) someone who has less than 100 years before them.  Not only that, but Belgarath tells his story in the first person.  As a result, what matters most to Belgarath (his family, his friends, his Master, and his peculiar quest) are painted in vivid detail; the rest however is given rather short shrift.  The stories of whole peoples are told in a few paragraphs--paragraphs moreover colored by the youthful Belgarath's (he was called Garath then) perception of them.<br /><br />Thus Tolnedrans are greedy and practical, Alorns love fighting, Arends (oh, don't get me started) and so on.  And it just so happens that the Tolnedrans kicked the young Gareth out of town for stealing.  (For example.)  I guess what really troubled me about that was how quickly Balgarath glossed over the (almost complete) extermination of the Marags.  I mean, here you have a whole people butchered senselessly because they happen to have some shiny stuff in their streams that is useless to them and the whole gets a paragraph or two with the explanation but we got a so-and-so out of it.  So fulfilling a prophecy made it OK then?<br /><br />Have I mentioned that Belgarath's perspective is sometimes not a mortal one?  But it is, in many respects, a deeply human one.  As when he goes mad when he thinks he lost his wife; when he falls in love with his youngest daughter and grudgingly admits that he loves his oldest daughter, Polgara the Sorceress, as when he abashedly apologizes for his mis-spent youth.  And of course the nicest thing about this book is that it feels like Belgarath is personally telling it to his family and friends.  And, as he tells his story, he tries to explain the history of his world--and theirs.  He wants to teach his family how (and why) it all came to pass the way it has.<br /><br />And in that, it succeeds brilliantly.  Not only could I not stop turning the pages but I literally could not wait to begin the next book in the series: Polgara.  All in all, I recommend this book.goes mad when he thinks he lost his wife; when he falls in love with his youngest daughter and grudgingly admits that he loves his oldest daughter, Polgara the Sorceress, as when he abashedly apologizes for his mis-spent youth.

B007PBKG5G|5.0|I'm not a music critic, just one who enjoys to listen to real music (you know, the kind you dont have to have a computer to make sound good). So I will not write an essay on why I love them and explain every last song and sound. Its simple, if you like Janis Joplin then you'd like the Alabama Shakes. This is refreshingly inspirational rock and roll with soul! The cd is awesome and seeing them live is even better. I'm starting to believe in music again. My only complaint is that I NEED MORE NOW!!!!!! can't wait for what else is to come...
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I loved this movie and was looking forward to its release on disk.  However, I can't tell you how disappointed I am that the digital copy is ultraviolet and not iTunes compatible.  As much as I love watching movies on our TVs, I really like the convenience of being able to watch them in iTunes on my devices.  It is so easy to pick up a device and watch a few minutes of a movie, when I have time.  I don't always have access to WiFi.  I wish all the studios would include iTunes-compatible copies with their discs.  Some include both UV and iTunes copies and that is fine.  But, PLEASE, give us the choice.  I hope that the extended edition will come with an iTunes copy.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My husband & I read this together - it is an amazing book!  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to understand and strengthen their relationship with their spouse.  We have a great marriage (39 years) and it is even better and more blessed because of having shared this book.<br />Side benefit: It also helps me understand our children, parents & friends more as well.

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The premise is a bit far-out, but once you get into Harold's pilgrimage, the kind reactions he encounters and the life-lessons he learns along the way make the novel.  Yes, the pilgrimage is a kind of 'journey of  life' with the mixed bag of characters  Harold meets, and the transformation of his wife as well as himself, but it is gradual and compassionate.  I do wish, however, that Harold had purchased a decent pair of walking shoes! (his masochism on this score is a bit of an unnecessary stretch).
B00000E7Q6|4.0|Where the original album was basic, with four songs that did nothing for me, the modern deluxe version is a quality package.<br />It needs to be trimmed down, but if you do it this way you will have a fine, well rounded album mix of techno jazz rock.<br /><br />The album the way it should have been:<br />1 The Wedding<br />2 Black Tie White Noise<br />3 Jump They Say<br />4 Don't Let Me Down And Down<br />5 Pallas Athena<br />6 Night Flights<br />7 Real Cool World<br />8 Lucy Can't Dance<br />9 Looking For Lester<br />10 The Wedding Song<br /><br />We set the mood with the instrumental `Wedding', which continues with the night club rhythm of the title song and the jazzy `Jump'. The alternate versions of `Jump' are both good, one being done with a rock beat, the other longer, in a progressive style. You cannot lose, even if you choose the original. The same goes with `Night' and `Athena'. The alternate versions are longer and progressive, more keyboard oriented. So you can make the album flow progressive or jazz rock if you want. You might want two playlist for this one. The upbeat `Cool' and bouncy `Lucy' bring this back into the rock world and make a good entrance for the swinging `Lester'. And we end back where we started, this time with a lyrical `Wedding'.<br /><br />Put together this way, \\"Black Tie White Noise\\" becomes a strong album. Great for daytime urban freeways and a late night get together. And while you have the wine and scotch flowing, you also get a DVD with six songs preformed and another three with videos, plus an interview. If you liked \\"Young Americans\\", this one may be for you. The original album may not have been perfect, but with this new deluxe document, playlist perfection is within your reach.<br /><br />And if you must have a `Miracle Goodnight', play it after you `Jump'.<br /><br />Deluxe version: 4.5 stars<br /> Original Version: 3 stars

B0012GMVVW|5.0|This is Bowie's moodiest album, dark and despairing. There is no sunlight here. It sounds like it was written by one of his characters locked up by Romano A Stone.<br />It is the sound of uncertainty and longing and, except for `HI', it is bleak.<br /><br />The album the way it should flow:<br />1 Sunday<br />2 Heathen<br />3 5:15 The Angels Have Gone<br />4 I Would Be Your Slave<br />5 I've Been Waiting For You<br />6 Cactus<br />7 Slow Burn<br />8 Afraid<br />9 Slip Away<br />10 Everyone Says \\"Hi\\"<br /><br />In this form the album slowly builds to a crescendo, before slowly fading out on its single happy note.<br /><br />Sunday<br />The melancholy of `Sunday' sets the tone. Drums, bass, chorus, vocals and sweeping keyboard define the minimalist approach the album will take. Cryptic lyrics sung with regret and desire lie in wait for us.<br /><br />Heathen<br />This was the first song written and the song that set Bowie on the path to record the new album in the style he did. Something about watching deer in the fields not far from the city. It brought hope and longing of a better future. And I guess the abstractness of artificial creations such as urban landscape.<br /><br />5:15<br />Soft drumming and an inconsistent baseline take us into a misty, rain shrouded train station. Soft layered keys support the story. Drums come on strong, as usual, sounding like the closest instrument to the mike. He starts to sing like he is ordering some of those poor chickens from KFC. Humans deserve to die. But alas not this time, as this was the song I was listening to when I totaled my car in the rain. Apparently the Angels had not left me yet, as I am still typing.<br /><br />I Would Be Your Slave<br />Now we get more upbeat. Drums and bass set a fast pace. One keyboard squirts out odd sounds in the back ground while another lays out a swift drone over all. A tinkling guitar adds an extra touch while vocals, once more, song of Longing.<br /><br />I Have Been Waiting<br />Now we get moving, as drums and guitar become more forceful, while keys and backing vocals keep the same tone as before, grounding it to what we have already heard.<br /><br />Cactus<br />A simple beginning of cymbal and beat, leads into folk guitar and then power drums. Once again the subject is Longing. Wishing, Expectation. Calling it `Cactus' makes no sense, but the song fits right into the overall sound and plot of the album.<br /><br />Slow Burn<br />Lead guitar dominates this one. A basic mid tempo rock song, it moves you along, slowly turning everything to smoke and ash.<br /><br />Afraid<br />The real rocker here, it has force and drive, propelled by fast drums and fast keyboard. Our protagonist for once feels a sense of empowerment. But it will not last.<br /><br />Slip Away<br />Keyboards evoke odd sounds, bringing on a melodic lifting lullaby about a past now gone. Drums dominate again, and again we are caught up in Longing. The sound sways us back and forth, carried on the wind of reminisce.<br /><br />Everyone Says \\"Hi\\"<br />F n flat out one of Bowie's greatest songs ever! Like `Five Years', `Suicide' and `Heroes', this is one of his emotional breakouts. It makes you feel like all the pent up feelings of the entire album come out with a slight ray of hope.<br /><br />Now in finishing, the song `Better Future' is also a happy song, but it seems way out of place on this album. It sticks out like a sore thumb, belonging more to one of Bowie's first albums. Same with `Spaceship'. But the other songs hold the album together so well that they make up for these two, and it retains its perfect artistic statement.<br /><br />4.8 starsget moving, as drums and guitar become more forceful, while keys and backing vocals keep the same tone as before, grounding it to what we have already heard.<br /><br />Cactus<br />A simple beginning of cymbal and beat, leads into folk guitar and then power drums.

0440237688|4.0|While reading this book I tried to picture myself living in a world that sacrifices freedom for security and joy for uniformity. In the Giver Jonas is struggling to accept this life in which you must be willing to get rid of the highs in life to get rid of the lows. The great aspect of The Giver is that everyone will relate to it in a different way. Some may relate with Jonas and want to break free, while others strive for this uniformity. Its a great way for us to step outside of what we know, and imagine what the world could be like if ran in such a way. It also made me wonder what career would be picked for me if I lived in such a world. Would I get something I enjoyed like Jonas's father, or be stuck with a job that did not best fit me.

1596432594|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book. It's a fun that encompasses all the major events in Feynman's life (of my knowledge). I believe the little science that was covered in the book was well displayed. If you enjoy this book you should read Ottaviani's book on Niels Bohr (Suspended in Language), I think it's better and it has more science in it. I've read 3 books by this author and plan to keep reading them, they are good and there isn't much in terms of science graphic novels on the market.

Zombies, Jacoby getting the s*** beat out of him, the whole band being burned alive, like i said crazily, awsome, sick videos!!! So worth every penny!

The emotional scale of events/experiences continues to incre4ase in a way that approaches the unbearable for even the reader, let alone the protagonists, however events continue to draw the reader onward into increasing complexity and experience.

B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|I'm not sure why some other customer said that this is not the region free version. I called Amazon before purchasing and they pointed me here. I have tried this product in several regions and it seems to work just fine.<br />It is the complete series with a bunch of bonuses (interviews, deleted scenes, etc.).<br />Good deal, good price, plenty of time for the family to enjoy it.

I am sorry to say that I just watched it and I hope that I will forget it.<br /><br />I will not go into what he said in detail, but I will say that he spent quite some time making excuses for David Marcus' sweater just before the last battle scene.<br /><br />Trust me on this.<br /><br />Brian

I liked the way it was written, it made the story move quickly. Also liked the way the book was written in the first person by 2 different people showing how two different people described/experienced the same situation. The way the plot twists and turns kept me guessing almost right up to the end. Great book. I highly recommend anyone to read it.

B00005JKJA|3.0|Oh come on. This film makes sense only if the story is explained to you. The cues for the dream passages are simply not articulated well. It's like the director didn't really care if you understand what's going on. And why is this girl even dreaming? Where are we going? Storywise there's no THERE there. The movie doesn't end, it simply stops. It's like the film broke mid-reel and both the audience and take-up reel are left spinning in perpetuity. Still, it's David Lynch, and there's wonderful film making -if not story telling- taking place.<br /><br />If you loved Twin Peaks you will likely love this film. If you were disappointed by the untidy loose ends of Twin Peaks... the pointless plot points, the surrealistic path that leads nowhere, and the unresolved elements of the last episode, then you may be equally disappointed in Mullholland Drive, which was initially devised as a TV pilot. The pilot was rejected, so Lynch tacked an ending on to it. What ending? What got resolved?<br /><br />David Lynch is a brilliant film maker, rendering unparalleled mood and intensity on the screen. But he has some internal compulsion that pushes him too far. He's creative enough to invent new metaphors, but he sticks with the old ones, as with the dwarf and the draped room (Mullholland Drive is arguably the opening episode for season 3 of Twin Peaks). Surrealism is great, but give it meaning David... even 'pretend' meaning. We want to go for the ride, but you never get us to the destination. That would be OK too if you would at least give us something to wrap our willingness to suspend-our-disbelief around. But there's just too many needless sub-mysteries and we lose interest.<br /><br />When the unsatisfactory ending to Mulholland Drive arrives you almost don't care because it's clear that the investment you've made in following the story turns out to be nothing more than mental masturbation. The film's got some great moments though, and still worth the view. Just temper your expectations. For me Lynch is at his best when someone hands him the story and he simply makes the movie. Dune was a masterpiece.ctations. For me Lynch is at his best when someone hands him the story and he simply makes the movie. Dune was a masterpiece.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|The book synopsis did not suck me in right away, but I decided to give it a shot anyway.  Glad I did.  Nothing too heavy or political here, just a fun read from Grisham.  A little far-fetched, but entertaining story.  Just a warning, if you plan on nit-picking the facts regarding law procedures, don't bother with this one.  Grisham himself states in the afterward that he did very little research.  Recommend.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Our 3 boys under 11 love the move, and it is pretty fun for adults too, so the family can watch and enjoy it together.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|App does what it should, when it should and how it should.  Rather refreshing when the last dozen or I purchased have been disappointing.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|I downloaded this app to replace Accuweather which I was using.  This app make it easy to update the current weather conditions.  It is easy to read and provides all the needed current information. I do have a problem with the 36 hour forcast temps being in centigrade instead of farenheit eventhough I have the settings on English.<br /><br />I would recommend this app to anone wanting to stay current on the weather forcast for your local area or for any other  location.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|The video is great and simple to access from whichever device I choose to use. Currently using my computer and Xbox 360.
1601251505|5.0|This is a little pricey compared to some books (even the WotC D&D 3.5 books, individually, were cheaper), but this essentially has two of the three core books SRD material in it, so it's actually a good deal in the long run. This community-driven unofficial heir to the D&D 3.5 edition d20 system is wonderfully made. The developers fixed many of the problems gamers had with the original rules by talking to gamers and having free open alpha/beta downloads of the book as it was being worked on so literally any gamer interested could read it, playtest it, and comment back to the team about it. The pages are all high quality colorful glossy pages, wonderfully illustrated, and has pretty much everything you need as a player to play the game. Best of all, it takes very little modification for anything already existing to be used with this modified variant of the 3.5 edition d20 system rules.
1400052173|5.0|I received my book promptly and in the condition described.  This is a great and intriguing story.  Definitely a page turner as well as great history and educational information..

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't believe I have to wait for the next book, I think these books are by far better than Fifty shades of grey
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is just terrible and boring!I do not like it and I am watching f1 right now. So... form your own opinion.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is easy to learn but unlike many others doesn't get boring very quickly.  Different modes and enemies keep it interesting and challenging
B005HEPL8K|5.0|Love it. Watch over and over again. STILL finding new stuuf and entertaining after all these years. Data is the best character by far.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Its the best puzzle app I have found, except the background  needs to be much lighter so  that there is contrast between background darker peices
B005HEPQ9O|5.0|Love  watching again and again. You have to watch a couple of times, but after watchig twice you will figure out what to skip...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very fun and makes u want to play it all day long. It also  is a very concentrating games because you have to focused protect yourself from the monster. Other than that I rate this 5 stars because it is really really fun game to play.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|Adele 21 I think is better and I owned that one before I got this but since it is Adele I'm certainly not disappointed.
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|You hear the name \\"Hitchcock\\" and it is a film you just have to check out. Like Hitchcock himself the movie is odd but entertaining. Peering into old Hollywood and the stars of yesteryear always delights with its  speculative nature. \\"Hitchcock\\" starts off with the director already inhabiting his celebrity, so you will not be watching a bio of the man. Anthony Hopkins who plays the title role never sold Hitchcock to me. And, being that I could not even find a hint of facial connection to the famed director, the loss was even greater. Of course Hopkins is a great actor, but the performance was contrived to the point where I felt it was a \\"I will now do my Hitchcock imitation\\", which isn't all bad, it just is what it is. Hitch's wife Emma played by the talented Helen Mirren was in counter a charming, possibly unrealistic, encapsulating portrayal of a lesser known figure.<br /><br />Watching the origins of the Psycho film play out before you is like putting puzzle pieces together. What shape goes where? Unfortunately there's a little too much TV movie style assembly which detracted from any theatrical magic happenings. There is a bulls-eye Anthony Perkins portrayal, a cardboard Vera Miles incarnation (intentional?) and a Janet Leigh physical upgrade (Scarlett Johanson) topped with a dead on hairdo. A standout is Hitch's secretary who has just the right glossy eye rolls and bewildered demeanor. Finally the (Paramount) picture head antagonist role safely keeps the caricature alive and well. If you want it all to fit, it will. If your missing pieces just push anything together to get this flexible bit of fun working.<br /><br />Psycho (the book) apparently derived some weird ideas from Hitch's dream mentor in the film, serial killer Ed Gein, which trickles in through the film in an attempt at creativity that falls flat on it's face. One of those \\"just not necessary\\" moves the slows the cinematic movement to a near kill.<br /><br />If you can get past it's scripty deliveries and hindering insertions, \\"Hitchcock\\" is an effective period piece that quickly whips figures into shape while holding just as fast to it's rather purposely morose intentions. Its a capable showing of entertainment and the endeavor is commendable, enabling me to toss out my, \\"for The Birds\\" title in favor of a more \\"review-esque\\" film title from one of Hitch's less notables.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I always love Downton Abbey.  This season had so many major losses.  Very sad season!  I still can't wait for the next season to begin.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Very good read skipped around a little and some grammatical errors but it was a good book an  I am now reading the  second book
0375869026|5.0|Choose this book for five second graders in an enrichment reading group.  The students couldn't put the book down and kept asking if they could read it throughout the day.  The discussions we are having are remarkable!  Great book.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book must have something to recommend it, and I downloaded it after reading ecstatic reviews and seeing that it was a bestseller.I failed to find anything riveting and stopped reading it halfway through
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm a late starter to this series.  Bought all the episodes from Amazon and have nearly caught up in a matter of a couple weeks.  This show needless to say grabs you and holds your attention from start to finish with eager anticipation of what will the next episode bring.  Wow!!  What a fun series to watch.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I recommend this to people who like mystery games, just like me! this is one of the most detailed games i had never played :) plus its worth it
B0060FXDCG|5.0|Really cheap compare to other places.The information is accurate and shipping came on date given. My friend really liked my gift who is a transformers lover. This was a success of a gift :)

B002SSUQFG|5.0|This watch is just a graet choice for an everday utilitarian style time piece.  This watch is easy to read and the movement f a sweeping second hand is awsome.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is an awesome game. Hours of entertainment.  I so rate this game 5 stars. If you can remember to get your food of the stove you'll get up in levels really quickly....and invite a lot of neighbors to send you materials
B0048IMZMG|5.0|I love most of Taylor Swift's songs, but hate to spend much money on just songs. So I loved this $3.99 deal for the whole album!
B000ID37KO|5.0|There are many ways in which this movie is trailblazing, Hitchcock always made the harmless terrifying and re-invented horror with psycho, but took things a step further here. Not only is this one of the first \\"nature vs. man\\" horror films, but also the isolation aspect of being trapped in an ever increasingly insecure space, it's a device used EVERYWHERE now, yet i can't think of a film more originally terrifying than the birds. maybe the exorcist, though i consider it an unfair comparison.<br />I've always loved these two particular Hitchcock(\\"call me hitch, hold the cock\\") films, though being far removed from the time period they were made in I find psycho/the birds to become more complex the older i get. i see something new with each viewing. his films are so well shot, cut, and arranged you often forget you are watching the work of a genius unfold. you'd think Hitchcock's shadow would loom heavy in the back of your mind after his goofy introductions, but he is invisible as you are lured into his imagination, ....it's hard to imagine in the next forty years what kind of films will stand the test of time like this.<br />There will be blood?<br />It's hard now to imagine the impact seeing this would have on the mind of a human in 1963, but i must admit being compelled beyond my will to watch these films whenever i happen across them.<br />In fact.....
0486274268|5.0|I found this book very helpful for learning the basics of drawing animals, This book is extremely helpful because it shows the artist how to draw animals both realistically and in a more exaggerated, cartoonish style. This book shows how to draw a wide variety of animals and also covers the basic muscle and skeletal structures of the various animals. I would recommend this book to artists who would like to learn the basics of animal drawing.
B00000DGUG|4.0|This was a great ablum, but it had a HUGE problem tha it was unable to be as great as the 1st one. Jagged Little Pill (JLP) was great at the right time, but anything less than that was viewed as a failure. Great songs on this one too.
0240808452|5.0|Mattesi's force is an excellent book for learning the techniques of gesture drawing. This book is great for learning how to portray motion in drawing and also for learning how to draw fluid, dynamic poses. &#34;Force&#34; gives helpful tips on how to determine where the &#34;forces&#34; are in the body while drawing a pose, such as the force of gravity, torque, etc. The book is also helpful for learning what types of lines and shapes to use when drawing the human body in various positions. This book gives great instruction on how to show all the forces that act on the moving body. I would recommend this book to anyone trying to learn how to draw quick gestures, or anyone who would like a very informative book on how to draw the human body in action.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put these books down. To understand the movie you have to read the books! I loved them!
1402766785|5.0|I found this book very helpful for learning structure and anatomy for figure drawing. The book outlines the various structures of the body, as well as their shapes and proportions. The book also explains how to draw the various body parts in different positions and lighting conditions. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to learn how to realistically draw the human figure.
1451695195|5.0|I ripped open the envelope and started reading right away, it flows very easily until it gets to the science part. The science is necessary, but you don't have to know what it all means. Having this occasional church going scientist have this experience is very exciting and gives my fear and so-so faith a swift kick...a boost. I think I have sold 10 of these already. I'm glad there was no kindle version as I want to keep it. It is now in my sisters hands.<br /><br />I am excited to have this man in Lynchburg, va!
B0026PA05M|5.0|Saw the live concert  version of this album and it was fantastic. The album is just as good. It rocks!
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|Bon Jovi never disappoints! Their newest album is wonderful-a good mix of rock and ballad. Worth every penny, as always!
B004BLDD9Y|1.0|The bulb that I received did not work.  I tried it in multiple lighting fixtures.  I ended up returning it.
0307279189|1.0|I have lived among the Tarahumara since 2005. I have real personal relationships with Tarahumara people. When I read this book I didn't see the people I know.<br /><br />The author's worldview prevents him from being able to see the true condition of the Tarahumara. The New Age/Left Over Hippy crowd believes all things tribal are good. This blinds them to the mind boggling suffering of the Tarahumara. Contrary to what the nuts believe, foot and leg injuries are very common among the Tarahumara, running barefoot or in sandals does not prevent foot and leg injuries. The incidence of diabetes is astonishing, the number of children who die before age 5 is shocking. Rape and sexual abuse of women and children is considered normal, and acceptable here. Oppression and discrimination against the Tarahumara is the norm. I often look around and am amazed by how so much suffering can happen in such a beautiful place. Beautiful people, beautiful mountains and heart breaking suffering.<br /><br />The author should be ashamed of himself for writing such a misleading book. If you read carefully you will discover that he visited our area a few times and somehow thought this qualified him to write a book.<br /><br />Truly there is none so blind as those who refuse to see.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|This album is a fine show case of Jason's maturation as both musician and a human with heart and soul. Beautiful poetic expression forms the foundation of this collection of Jason's works. I especially love the instrumentals. More than anything I love the sound and quality of Jason's voice, the expression coming through him. This is my new favorite album-for the year;) well done!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I love this and I listen to this all through the christmas season and sing to his songs, his voice is great.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best that I have read in sometime you will get to where you will look forward to reading time again
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|this cd was a good one, i like it very much and i think that others will like it to.
B007L5GDGW|1.0|I couldn't get it to play.  Every time I clicked play it would just go on its own way.  No control.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This movie was better then I could have imagined.  I had many tell me that I needed to see it, and now I know why!  I plan to view it again soon!  5 star!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Get this ap it is very good... And it's free so that's great. Good music good customization. Nice graphics. Yup.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I like this just fine; not as good as my $45 case for my previous Kindle, but that may be because I am not used to it yet.  But it definitely does what it is supposed to do.  I just find it somewhat awkward
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|Wish it was easier to play. Needs better way to control the steering since you can easily go off track.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My favorite character is Darryl. The whole cast, plot, story line is great and enticing. The show is developing nicely.
B0031RAOVY|3.0|Good movie but drawn out too much, thereby causing a 'like' rather than a 'love.'<br />In my opinion it is too slow for young children.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed this book, I'm still reading the second one, and its taking no time to finish. It really sucks you in. It's just like the movie, but it goes more in depth and gives you a better picture of this world. There are a few places where it kind of jumps around and randomly skips ahead which kind of bother me, but its still a good read.
1609611543|5.0|Your health is well worth the book. This book is wellness for your health. Let's all get well and stay well!

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app ever !!!  There is a website also. I would recommend this for everyone . And all  ages

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game. My 2 daughters and my granddaughter loves this game!<br />I give this game five stars!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is one of the best I've ever read. Although it hasn't got me through any rough times yet I'm sure it will.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an awesome game! Once you get past 300 coins it speeds up and can get a little tricky otherwise this game is really fun and easy. This game is pretty much like Temple Run but involving trains.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I wish I had back the time I wasted reading this crap!!<br />This book was awful. Round and round it goes to no where.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|I remember seeing some episodes of this series when it originally ran and it made a lasting impression on me...when I saw that it had been remastered and released I knew I had to buy it.  It certainly did not disappoint.  Ian Richardson played the ultimate scoundrel--he did a superb portrayal of Francis Urquhart.  The drama never dropped off and although I was sure that Francis Urquhart would &#34;get his day&#34; how it occurred was not anticipated.  While this series is &#34;fictional?&#34; one cannot help but wonder how much of the corruption, lies and illegal actions play a part in the overall political process in all countries.
B007REV4T8|5.0|The best action packed movie ever, great to watch weekly, another great add to our collection.  Pre ordered it and once it was delivered it was $4 less then when we ordered it, gotta love that
B007DIQC90|5.0|Loved this groupings of songs by Monsters and Men.  I bought this as a treat to  myself and So glad I bought this CD.
1885167776|5.0|If you're a student of personal growth, this needs to be in your library. I've studied from Jim Rohn, Darren Hardy, John Maxwell and the list goes on. This deserves a spot right next to them. It simplifies the message so that it's probably great for beginners as well as those that have been in a growth mindset for some years now. This book has better helped me time block (and I'm already pretty fierce about that) and better allocate my time to doing my ONE Thing. If you're looking for a powerful yet easy read, this is it. I feel bad for those selling it used. They haven't found the value enough to keep it for themselves and even if its an extra, to pass the value to a friend or family member. This book is that powerful. Mine is tabbed to death with notes all over the post-its. Share the value with those around you. My next purchase is a case so I can share the wealth of this amazing book. Best of luck in your life travels. May your ONE Thing be a guiding light to your future successes.
B008D36INE|4.0|The movie was a little slow but had a good movie beginning climax and end. It was sort of real like what actually happens.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game has been good.  I love horses only wish I had one of my very own.  Any way game has great graphics the horse moves realistically  and is fun to Chang it appearance. Love it love it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i like this game but it has a few glitches like all. there are a lot of ads. i do like how if you wait a month or so you can get a lot of gems. i bought 3 horses in one day with that. :) ;)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just remember to wait for the ad when it first loads and you're good to go. I am impatient and clicking too soon can crash the ad. Fun game and I kind of like that coins regenerate slowly so I am forced back into the real world. :)
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|Needed this movie for a college assignment.  Very good movie and acting.  Also got good grade in school. Recommend to anyone
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I finished \\"Me Before You\\" in tears, but I loved it! It's been a while since I read a book that has so affected me on such a personal level. Jojo's writing style is engaging and flows beautifully. I won't go into details to avoid spoilers, but I think this topic was handled very sensitively. She gave me a lot to think about regarding something I thought I already had all figured out by allowing me to put myself in someone else's shoes. I highly recommend.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|We thought it was a great movie; however, it seemed to drag on a bit. My 4-yr-old is a superhero fanatic and it holds his attention for the most part.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game I just wish you could have a foal and the energy thing sucks, let alone it's still a pretty good game. And the ads are a pain in the butt.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game and I have no problem with it.I would recommand it to all the Temple Run fans out there
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It is a very good game if you have the time to play.  I think children would like it more.  The graphics are okay.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great game! You can change your character,car, and you can get boosts! The only part I don't like is that they give you barely any time before the game ends. Other than that I love  the game!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy playing this game! I like it a lot better than regular solitaire! I could play this game for hours!
B00AHTYI5M|1.0|Review contains spoilers:<br /><br />People tend to believe at least some of what they see at a movie \\"based on a true story\\", especially when Ben Affleck was telling anyone and everyone that Argo was based on a true story, or \\"a true story\\"  while promoting this film.  Please read \\"The House Guests\\" to get an accurate account of the 6 refugees that hid at the Canadian ambassador's house during the Iranian hostage crisis. If you want to watch a movie about this event, try to find a copy of The Canadian Caper\\", it was a made for TV movie put out  in 81(?) and far more accurate, better and interesting than Argo was.<br /><br /> Yes. the fake movie Argo was the cover story for the refugees being in Iran. The 6 house guests never had to use this cover story at the airport. The refugees also had 2 sets of airline tickets, one for the final destination of Canada, and one for England, There were no last minute computer checks to verify airline tickets.There is no evidence that the Iranians spent massive amounts of time putting together shredded documents found at the U.S. embassy. The Brits did not turn the 6 away, they kept them safe for as long as possible.  The flight took off smoothly, with no police cars chasing  the airplane and shooting at it. If you're flying a plane and people start shooting at that plane, what will you do, land? Even in the land of make believe any sane pilot would continue to fly out. Perhaps a better way of producing this fiction would be to have the control tower call the plane back to the ground. There was no evidence that the  Iranians spent any time putting together shredded documents showing faces of the refugees.<br /><br />The fact is, had the U.S. not been involved at all, the outcome would have been exactly the same for the 6 house guests. Canada, and New Zealand (mostly Canada)  did everything of consequence to get the refugees out of Iran.  Everything the U.S. did in the movie Argo to get the hostages out was either  a complete fabrication, or at the end of the day made no difference in getting the refugees out of Iran.<br /><br />There are so many interesting facts that could have been put into the movie to make it more realistic. For example, one of the check points at the airport was unmanned. The refugees could have claimed ignorance that they were supposed to go to 2 counters  and moved straight to the departure lounge,  They even discussed doing that. How would they know an unmanned counter would be important, or even notice it? They decided not to do that, and waited for a sleepy old clerk  to come out from his back office where he was making himself tea. This man didn't match up the yellow slips with the white slips, and sent the refugees to the departure lounge without incident. That would have made the movie much more \\"human\\",  believable and interesting. But no, Ben Affleck and the people who wrote the screenplay  would have none of that.<br /><br />These are only some of the reasons I think the screenplay is for this movie is extremely bad.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I have used the knife sharpener, and it works well.  I have not yet tried the one for different type of knife blades.  It's small and compact, and that is one of the other things I like about it.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Good solid solitary app alil annoying with all the ads. but hey you can't have everything. Even if you want it
B007SGM084|5.0|This is an awesome love story! Yea, it has some funky, kinky sex in it, but basically it's a love story and how communication, love and trust are so important in all relationships! I really enjoyed the email banter and references to Ana's subconscious and inner diva!! Too funny! Hope some more written along this theme come out!
