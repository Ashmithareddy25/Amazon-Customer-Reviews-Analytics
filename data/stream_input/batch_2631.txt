B005HSL626|5.0|I got this for the kids.  They love it and are great at it.  However my parents have come to love it as well.  This is the first game they have played on a touch screen device.  I say it is great for all ages.  We are very competitive, which works great for the scoring.  Free is also a nice price.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This has been a lifesaver, or at least a job saver. I have a job on graveyard shift and I have a lot of trouble sleeping during the day. But now I sleep like a baby and wake up rested. I'm up all night with no problem and enjoy my work immensely. Thank you!
B003TH14H4|5.0|I love Castle.  I honestly started watching it for Nathan Fillion, but I really enjoy it and have watched all that I can.  Love the all the characters.  This was also very nice to rent just one episode when I missed one.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Loved his Pillars of the Earth set, and this one is just as involved and a great History Lesson.  Will definitely order the next one in the Trilogy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter likes to play it for my granddaughter who is just learning about horses she 2. My daughter says it's a fun time waster that's not real hard.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Have read several near death experiences like &#34;Heaven is for Real&#34; and &#34;90 Minutes In Heaven&#34;.  So glad he touched on all the scientific things why this should not have happened.  Our church book club did it and some had a hard time with all the medical terms, etc.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|We (seniors) enjoyed this.  The actors are some of our favorites, and the fact they used real retired professional musicians delighted us.  Our experience told us Maggie Smith handled her friend's dementia skillfully and with compassion.  We commented to each other that probably our kids generation would not be interested in this movie.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|this is the perfect game to those who enjoy classic rpgs and the series. if you haven't gotten this game i strongly advice u to do so
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|My husband and I love this movie and have watched it too many times to count. What an awesome story of grace! Excellent acting and singing as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a awesome game with much effort put into it. the graphics are pretty good but have a few glitches but overall a very good game
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Shine Runner is a well polished game with lots of Fun Aspects:  You drive a Speeding Airboat through the Swamp to Buy and Sell Moonshine and many other items after collecting Money found along the way.  You have try to aim Boat carefully towards Money Bags in the water and above it by Jumping Ramps.  Not easy to accomplish since you travel at HIGH RATE OF SPEED all the time and Police Boats and other objects get in your way often.<br /><br />HD Graphics are awesome and Quality can be adjusted in Options menu.  Music and Sound Effects also have individual Volume controls. There are NO Intrusive annoyances.<br />All Menus, Options and Instructions are well done and very helpful.  Money Scoring is sensible also.<br />NOTE:  This is a FAST PACED, flat out game so it is hard to control Airboat.  NO SPEED CONTROL so you run into things and Crash often.  Fortunately, you don't lose but just recover and keep going after each crash.<br /><br />Overall, it is Highly Polished, Enjoyable, Addictive, Funny and Fun .  It has Great Replay Value too.<br />Sadly, I Deducted 1 Star because the Boat Control is TOO SLOPPY and Flat out HIGH SPEED with No way to slow down reduces accuracy and gets frustrating.  I hope Developer modifies Controls to make it Better since Many of us prefer a less FRANTIC Pace in order to Enjoy the gameplay better.  Still A GREAT GAME though!  I  Recommend it and look forward to updates.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game! When I first played it I got absolutely addicted to it. It's a fantastic product and I love it!!!
1451629192|5.0|Easy reading by the author who experienced this traumatic nightmare. Hard on the emotions but if you want to know what really happened to her for 18 years, read the book. It may make you a more empathetic person.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is fun and addicting and I really love it but the reason why it's not 5 stars is because when you get faster in the game it glitches  and I run into a train. Other than that it's fine. I would recommend this to anyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Purchased this as a surprise gift for my daughter-in-law. She was so excited when she opened the package. Her work schedule doesn't allow her to watch it on TV.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I have not bought this app yet but I can already tell that it is a total copy of minecraft. the graphics are probably  better than minecraft, but it is still a total copy. I wouldent bother buying this game, because plain  minecraft is much better.<br /><br />if this was not a total copy of minecraft, then I would probably consider buying this game. save your 2$.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Game of Thrones is one of those books, movies that you return to again and again. Can't wait for Season 3 to come out.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This was great! Granted I wasn't in the BEST shape, but I DID exercise daily before starting this program, It kicked my butt! Days 1-4 of Level one killed me. but after that it got better. The first 2 days of level 2 were really hard too! But I've gotten SO much stronger since Day 1 on L1. It definitely takes effort and is a challenge! I'm currently on day 2 of L3 and I will say that it is easier than L2. I would not suggest weighing regularly while doing this program! If you are not fit when you start you are most definitely going to gain muscle! But muscle kick fat in the rear! It takes up less space and burns 3x as many calories as fat....even when you aren't working out. I suggest tracking progress through measurements and pictures. TOO MANY PEOPLE STOP BEFORE THE 30 DAYS ARE OVER! It's 30 Days for a reason, kitties. Don't give up! 2 thumbs up!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love being able to access my Pinterest account on my Kindle now! Would have rated it 5 stars but it tends to load slowly and it has locked up on me a couple times.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I got the free version to try it. It was amazing for awhile so i bought the full version to download videos now it just goes to a loading screen anytime i try to watch a video and i cant watch my downloaded ones neither. Its really making me mad because i paid for the app and it doesent even work
B0090XLDKY|5.0|The music, the actors, the voices, and the production. My disabled daughter can sing along with the performers which keeps her entertained.
B004LUS390|5.0|I bought this to make anime that was it.<br />First I thought there wasn't a way to choose another color but black but over time I perfected my skills and now I'm on this app 24/7!!!
B002GHIPYI|4.0|Well, when I first got it, I thought this would help me monitor my sound. While it does a good job, there's a low frequency that I sometimes hear. It's barely audible, and it seems present no matter what project I'm working on. However, it's enough to get the job done, as it helps me mix music down to make my mixes more enjoyable than from my cheap earbuds.<br /><br />It's affordable enough for me to recommend, and I would buy another type of headset from this company.
0061537969|5.0|Paid extra for overnight and was told it would be here on June 26.  On June 28 Amazon indicated it had been delivered the evening before. But not here!  It is very difficult to contact Amazon and annoying since it was a gift for someone going away.  So may be best to go to bookstore (remember those) and walk out with it in your hand.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|No surprise that a somewhat aging Arnold is a Sheriff in a small town out to get the bad guys.  Great supporting cast, lots of action and fun,  Regardless of his age (in one scene he is asked how he feels and he replies &#34;old&#34;).  Arnold can still kick butt, look handsome, and give off the testosterone; he's the sheriff you'd want in your own town if your town was in trouble with bad guys running amok!
1470056496|4.0|Reading Mansfield Park is like looking into a clear pool and seeing a reflection, your response to which discloses your deepest self. When you read it, you will either find its heroine, Fanny Price, and her cousin, Edmund, intolerably moralistic and judgmental, the sort of people that you are very sure ought to be shot, or your mouth will be agape at the significance of the idea that such people could, in principle, actually exist, like supposing Platonic forms to exist in an invisible, ideal world. You will either wish you knew them or be almost wild with relief that you don't.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|love it so much that I have been able to play this game and pee in my familypants and popp in my pants and undies to any more poop my pants  today can u please change me now i am gonna be changed and poop in my pants and undies right now bc I peed my pants and popped my pants so much
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the characters, the story lines, and I can hardly wait to see see what happens next!  Yes it reminded of other stories, but Sylvia Day made me care for each and every person in this series!
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Uninspired lyrics, lazy production value and overall just terrible. It's like one long 45 minute song that's been chopped up into pieces and called tracks. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it. updated it today now it has this gamecircle thing and will not let me open it. updates are not my friend has deleted my village twice please fix or ill cry
B006IYG5HE|4.0|I've read several of this author's books, and I've enjoyed each one. The main character is flawed and definitely always interesting.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|Its Twin Peaks....You either love it or you hate it, and I love it. Classic and Corky murder mystery with a unique touch by David Lynch and company.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved the series. I'm hoping there's a Book Six. I also want to see the HBO series. I'll probably buy the DVD set.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|If you like detective stories, you must buy this book. The complete Sherlock Holmes gives you hours and hours of fantastic plots and story lines.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I give five stars because it seems like I have a real horse the only thing I don't like is you can't name your first horse
B00ALKRVTM|5.0|Many of these stories I watched thanks to the great UK TV series, but ultimately the best way to experience Hercule Poirot is to read the great books by Agatha Christie. She said if she had to choose she would favor Miss Marple above Hercule Poirot, the difference being (amongst others) Miss Marple is perfect for short stories and Hercule Poirot for novels. If you read this book you will see Agatha Christie did a great job in writing short Poirot stories as well. Highly recommended!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is very good cuz you you get coins every round and it shows you the first round how to do it but in real life if you did this you would get arrested
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway suffers is a great game. I love to play it a lot, it's something you can spend a lot of tome on. However I feel that the game needs much improvement. The game tends to slow down a lot causing you to get caught very easily. There is also the fact that the game does not offer enough chances to get keys. If you were to buy them it takes to much $$$. You should be able to trade them for a reasonable amount of game coins. The other stuff you trade for using tokens/change should be cheeper, that way you could continue adding in new stuff such as boards,people,and powerups. That way everyone wins. This game really is fun, but there are just some things you forgot that could make the game a lot more fun.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Such a great read! 4 stars! Easily read and completely intriguing! It had me from the very first page! Read this!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was truly a humbling story of two very different people who touched each others' lives forever. I could hardly put it down!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It is slightly boring but interesting for little children. It teaches children how to care for animals. It also brings a peace of mind to both parents and children.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|I'll not rate the individual elements of the movie as that is something you can find on a movie site.  I will only say that Amazon provided an uninterrupted download to Roku and the movie was view without any interruption in full HD.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Used the free version for a few weeks and decided to upgrade to the paid version. Well worth the money. Use it almost every day. Really like the time remaining feature for each function.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie on Amazon on Roku.  While the reader may be interested in the character development, scenes, plot development, etc., I will just say that Amazon brought this Oscar Winning movie to my home without any download problems.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very dependable and easy.  I've used it with my Kindle Fire for over a year and it's excellent. Highly recommend.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|great collection with the added digital features.  this is the version that has the new scenes added, and was at the theaters.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game.  Very challenging and keeps your attention.  Can not wait for the new levels to come out soon!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook should optimize for kindle fire<br /><br />This is just the android phone version<br />Very clumsy when use in landscape mode
B000024K3R|5.0|All songs are wonderful. I bought this based on a few songs I heard at someone's house a few years ago: On my way home, Anywhere is, Hope has a place, China Roses. Really sonorous album. Highly recommend
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|I loved this movie.  Have recommended it to family & friends.<br />would watch it again. Also good gift idea for all ages.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|short and fun keep an eye on every detail its easy and entertaining,,  just hope that more free levels are added very soon,,
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game.  Looking forward to more levels.  This is a challenging game but not so challenging as to be frustrating.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun. free game but would pay for it! Wish there were more rooms available!  Very addictive but challenging!  cant wait till they continue!
B00006V9A0|4.0|This is a rock album is a classic and must-have for any music lover. There are great tunes for any mood.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and much more original than temple run and temple run 2. Entertaining and fun you could play all day ,and you will be entertained. On  of the best concepts for a game. For all ages.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Christina McKenna plants the personalities of James and Lily-Lydia into the mind. The personalities of these two people, the chaos  of their respective childhoods, is both haunting and horrific. It makes me want to scream into the past...at the deaf church fathers for allowing such disrespectful UN-Christ-like activity. (Thank goodness for the real life people like Rose and Paddy)<br /><br />McKenna shows the miracle of tenacious human spirit of the Irish people to plod onwards despite all odds...This cast of characters will whisper to me for a long,long time.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|After waiting for 15+ years for a fully enjoyable QR album, the guys have finally delivered in a big way! I lost all hope of ever hearing the sounds that made QR who they were and what made me fall in love with them back in '86. After listening to this album for nearly a week (I got an early copy :-), I can say that this is the best and most complete album (no filler songs) since Mindcrime. Every song just adds to the whole album. From killer guitar riffs/heading banging songs that sound like something off the Rage and Mindcrime album to sweeping anthemic melodies and choruses off The Warning and Empire. Of course the biggest question was how well could Todd La Torre replace Geoff Tate. Well he certainly answers that as Todd delivers through out the album sounding like Tate at certain times while bringing his own style and voice as well. People have complained that the album is too short, but I for one see the bright side: 35 mins of straight up Ryche-n-Roll v.s. 60 mins of semi-par music. Everyday, I seem to have a different favorite song and last album that gave me that was Mindcrime.<br /><br />IMHO, this album puts Toddryche's version of QR back in the forefront of hard rock/metal. Welcome back QR to the fold. Rare to see a band like this come back with such a sold album. Looking forward to their new stuff (which they have already started working on!)and seeing where else this band can go.<br /><br />\m/ Ryche-n-roll \m/
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|... and I didn't expect much.  The movie had decent action scenes but not much substance.  I wouldnt rent it again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just started watching this show a few weeks ago starting from season I and am totally hooked!  Love the characters, costumes and sets.  It is well done, with a great cast.  I love that the drama is interspersed with plenty of humor.  Can't wait for season IV.
B001C46P2K|2.0|This said it was like new condition but it was not an original movie it was a copy.  My cable tv quality movies are better quality than this dvd is.  Not happy!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love the game but hate the fact that it isn't available for the first generation of Kindles. I don't see myself getting the newer version of Kindle anytime soon, so it won't get played much because it is so small on my phone.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|For now this is one of the most interesting, advanced and exciting games in Kindle App store. And till some moment it's free :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game!!! Very addicting!! Makes you forget your problems and worries!!!! Love it.. must download !!!  You have nothing to lose, but everything to gain!!!
B0053O89YM|2.0|This review is for the condition of this &#34;new&#34; product.<br />While watching the second disk in this box, one of the shows froze, it wouldn't &#34;skip&#34; ahead, go back, stop, nothing. When we removed the disk from the player we discovered it was badly scratched. This was sold to us as new. However it was used and repackaged as new.<br />I will not buy from this seller again. To pay for a new product, and receive a repackaged used one is fraud.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really liked the books. They were very entertaining and just fun to read. I bought them for a trip and it made some of the traveling much easier.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Richard Ford, one of the best writers of this generation. Told thru the voice of a 66 year old man looking back at himself at age 15, he slowly tells of a family broken apart by a shocking incident leaving him and his twin sister abandoned to fend for themselves.  The boy's ability to accept his life and to internalize the strange and desolate situation that is forced upon him helps him to survive.  Ford's painting of the places, scenery, odors, and characters bring this stark novel to life.  I look forward to reading more of his books.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The broken up short story telling format (personal interviews) went on too long and made it difficult to keep my overall interest going.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Everyone reeeeeaaaaaly needs to get this game!!!! I can't describe this game it's so epic! I wish I could give it 1000000000000000000000000000000000 stars! I've already got an EPIC FORMED DRAGON!!!!!!! I recommend this game for everyone in the entire galaxy!!!!!!This should be the NUMBER ONE GAME in the universe!!!!!! My cutest dragon is my light dragon, witch costs 150,000 coins,but I got it!!! My strongest dragon is FERN, my EPIC FORMED DRAGON!!!! I also have a titan dragon, a magic dragon, a four-leaf dragon, and many, many,many more!!!!! If you get this game my island name is magic touch, and my storm8 is Lela1230. Remember, GET THIS EPIC GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|I didn't pay attention to this when it first came out because I thought this was going to be low quality acting and bad CG. One afternoon I thought I'd give it a try since I REALLY love sci-fi flicks. I was not disappointed. Next thing I know it was getting dark and I finished Season 1 and decided to make it a sci-fi night as well and went on to finish Season 2. Here's my problem with this..... WHERE'S MY SEASON 3???!!! So, quick recap. Good acting, good storylines and CG added at appropriate times so it doesn't take away from the story which is the struggles of the characters.
B005LAII94|5.0|Loved the scenery and the suspense! All the actors are great in this, especially John Travolta. This is a movie I love enough to watch more than once!
B004SIIBGU|1.0|I tried for over half and hour, and even reset my password (which didn't work), I eventually downloaded this app, and was able to log in on my first attempt with no trouble.  I think the mobile version doesn't allow you to log in so that you are forced to download this app for one reason or another.  I tried the classic site version, which always redirected me to the mobile log in, and after 20+ attempts I doubt that I entered either my username, new password, or the confirmation code wrong every single time.  I'd give this lower than one star if I could.
B004G0DN7W|5.0|I enjoyed seeing it again took me back to my childhood. Yul Brynner was awesome in this one. ok ok
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|The script for this movie should never have been considered by Hollywood producers.  The script is very shallow, boring and uncomfortably predictable.  The film was definitely not written with children in mind, nor the healthy adult.  Even the actors in this film gave the appearance of boredom with the script. It made their character acting seem disingenuous. I would think that they were only too happy to clock out at the end of the day.<br /><br />Now that I have you curious, I would still recommend that you save your money and avoid this film.
1476734941|5.0|Science based; works on many levels. Don't think you can fast? You can with this method. It quickly becomes a life style that allows normal eating.  It just does not feel like a diet, but the good for your body aspects are quicky obvious. I have gifted it to two friends already...
B006N0YWGY|2.0|Asus Transformer TF101<br />The game looked great and the reviews were great.  I installed the game and started a game and it froze at the first turn.  All I could do was close and restart but the same thing happened.  Uninstalled.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|Better than I expected. We were pleasantly surprised by this movie. I really did not want to see it, having grown up with the original - but I actuially sat down and watched it from start to finish.
B0092EE5HY|4.0|I had read one of these stories back in the 1980's in Analog and enjoyed it.  Since then, have read some other work by G.R.R. Martin and appreciated being able to go back in his career.  I was rewarded by a series of great short stories on a common theme!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is amazing for all ages my 6 year old sister plays it my dad plays it my mom plays it and the best part is its free
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This book starts out well and engages the reader, with some suspense arising as to the relationship between Harold, his wife and their son. As the story proceeds, the daily events start to become a bit predictable and the finale feels somewhat unresolved, considering the whole plot is predicated on Harold reaching his goal.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the story has the capacity to cause the reader to contemplate a number of human predicaments and to feel for the characters.
B00BJ64FU0|4.0|Always an easy read, a quick night time end  of the day story that holds my interest. Old Watson tells tales....
B007RTAR64|5.0|The costume is really nice .<br />I bought it as a collector's item because it is interesting , and not a typical Barbie .<br />I expected her to look as good as her photo , and she didn't disappoint .<br />Some slightly older &#34;collectable&#34;  Barbies I have have gone up somewhat , in value .
B003K15INU|4.0|To bad this guy has opted out of more books, I understand he feels it's time to retire. He's just great.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|It just takes you to the Facebook website, you can do that just fine on Dolphin, or any browser for that matter... who needs this? ha
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Seems to have a little of everything and again shows that Denzel can fit any role. Many actors play only roles written to match who they want to be and seeing one of their movies you've seen them all.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|This is a beautiful CD, a great compilation of this gentle giant's most popular songs. I love it and am so glad I got it! My CD arrived promptly and in excellent condition. Thank you!
0062209493|5.0|this was a gift he enjoyed it and is passing it around I was happy I was able to find it on Amazon
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I love the angry birds star wars. But, it will not open no matter what I try. PLEASE FIX IT!!!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I'm so happy that Amazon finally has this app from face book. I can finally play on kindle. I love this game. Works well on kindle fire hd just like computer.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Forget the movies and read it. It is the best book in my kindle collection ;) However movies Swedes are more faithful to history book
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I just downloaded this app today and I cannot put it down! It is easy to play and there are several perks to receive. Subway Surfers is very successful in my eyes.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|this is a classic and never get tired of hearing it, rocks from beginning to end!  the doors were my fav so what else can I say?  saw them several times live, doesn't get much better than that!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty good game. I like it is fun and entertaining for my kids. They like playing it a lot. Go ahead and try it
B008MWBY6W|4.0|After reading reviews of this camera case, I was somewhat uneasy ordering it. Mainly because of the measurements and conflicting accounts on them. Would it fit my camera??? Well, it did. I have Canon EOS 4Ti WITH battery grip and 18-135 lens. Yes, it is pretty snug fit, but I like it: the camera does not wobble around in the case. The side pockets are small, but will handle everything you need for a short trip: lens wipes, memory cards, lens filter or two and spare batteries. I use 6 AAs in my power grip and there is room for a spare set. Plastic clips for a shoulder strap are OK, could be metal, but not for that price. I took it on vacation to Mexico and had no problems. So, I was pleasantly surprised by this Amazon branded product and would recommend it.<br />By the way, similar CaseLogic camera case was too small for my camera with the grip, but OK for one without it.
B00CDV6WDS|2.0|I loved this when I first got it, but then they changed it. They started charging you time for hints and shuffles. Well they fixed that and only charged for hints, which that is OK. But now they completely screwed it up and took away the shuffle!!! Now when you run out of moves your DONE!! SO STUPID!!!!!!!
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Best CD since Empire..... May even say its the best CD out of all 13. Todd La Torre rocks, as do the rest of the guys. This CD shows just how much Geoff Tate held this band back. Congrats Queensryche Official, you did it!!!!
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Read this book 40 years ago and appreciated the Don's timeless lessons in leadership much more the second time around. An extremely well written story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. it's great for passing the time. the horses and fun to play with. I would love to play with other people to.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|An action packed Baldacci novel with a neat twist to tie it all up at the end. Good beach read.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This app is great! My daughter loves it. It's very child-friendly, easy for her to figure out and play by herself. She loves the really appealing colors and sounds and voices of the game. Very high quality and EDUCATIONAL! That's the most important part! I always want my daughter to have fun while learning and this game sure does that for her! She loves it!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Every week that I would watch Dr. Who, I would see this other show called Orphan Black following it. I saw a couple of clips, but couldn't figure out what the show was about, so I skipped watching it. Weeks later, some friends were talking about how much they like Orphan Black, so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! It starts off a bit slowly, but once it gets going, it doesn't lose steam. I was amazed at how Tatiana Maslany was able to differentiate each character such that I actually believed they were different people. Though it veers mostly on the side of being a thriller with an underlying conspiracy unfolding, it also keeps things from getting too tense with some appreciated comedic breaks, especially from the interaction between Felix and Alison.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|i love it!!! i can even restore data if i back it up. saved my entire school grade!!! i recommend this app to all future writers!  you can change font background design and add protective password!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What's not to like about a British period drama? It's British, making it instantly charming, the banter between the characters is amazing. The storyline captivates you and doesn't let you get bored. The various characters and twists in the storyline make this charming and captivating. Recommended for all drama lovers out there.
B001AFF25W|5.0|There are many great ideas, well written and topical.<br />I especially liked the authors way of reinforcing the idea by using multiple suggestions.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Slow to start but it picked up quickly.  Great series of work. I would highly recommend to most people I know.

1401233376|5.0|I have to say i am a BIG 'The Flash' fan and wow. This comic was something right when you pick up you can't put it down. The pace of it is perfect and the Art makes the thing become real. I am happy i bought this, because i will be picking it up again to read it over since it was that good! Totally worth it!! (Also, Amazing shipping speed!! i ordered this and another book and was expecting it to come like 4-12 days.. i got it it 2!! Awesome!!)
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game is awesome I mean it is so awesome it is the most awesome way to play a game.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Bummer... It wasn't nearly as good as first two. Waited so long for this book and it was mediocre at best.
B006N0YWGY|1.0|steering did no direction changing. boat kept moving in straight line while steering spins it in circles still moving forward.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Great read and wonderful characters. The story line was great. Todd is handsome and protects what is his! This is a must read!!
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|The author said this started out as a short story and that's what it felt like too me- and not a terribly interesting one at that.  The characters never really grabbed interest nor was I really moved by them.  Disappointed, but it was very short so thankfully only wasted 2 nights on it.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Perfect. One word and done. Hold two cups..no problems. Lots of extra room for keys/phone/snacks. Sturdy. Well-made. Matches well with my black Britax B-agile stroller that doesn't come with cup holders. Love it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really liked this game. Fun game. I had to really think about some levels but satisfying when you figure it out.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|We really like this movie.  Every time we watch it, we catch new details.  Lives up to its reputation.  Thanks
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I read some reviews that were unsure but I love this case. It's light weight and the stand works perfectly. I would not recommend using it with a child who may drop it often. But for an adult, it's excellent.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Only a few actually play. All the reviews giving the game more then 1 star are fakes. It's not exciting. The cost of doing the same job increases with same time frame. The developers only were thinking of micro-transactions.<br /><br />This game is only good for taking up your time while on the can.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The mode hard I am and can't get off. Been this way for three hour. Halp ploz I'm new to hard man  garruk. Halp and I will nevar forget this
B000JML90Y|5.0|This is a classic. I read it back in the 70's, so it's time to read it again. Buy it.
0770435726|1.0|I had a hard time figuring all the 5 star reviews for this poorly written novel until someone pointed out that the author was married to a publishing exec and past Amazon exec. I know times are tough in the publishing business but boosting sales through advertising and loading Amazon reviews is a pretty poor practice.<br /><br />This is one of the most frustratingly badly written novels I have encountered in years. The point of view shifts back and forth in time with little or no clue for the reader. Sometimes sections are labeled 'Today,' but that day also seems to shift around with no clues. Plus the overall story is not all that great. It is primarily about a cyber crime theft of a lot of money, but why all the drama? The protagonist has in implausible back story that is constantly referred to, but in the end has nothing to do with the story. I won't go into any details other than this little gem (which I might be paraphrasing) \\"The coffe was luke warm; its temperature having reached the ambient temperature of the room.\\" The author seems to think at times he is Proust as some sentences are so long and convoluted you lose track. And extraneous material? How about an entire paragraph to describe a rain hat the protagonist is NOT wearing? I could go on, but if you are thinking of buying this dirge you have been warned.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Good characterization.The plot held my interest as is unfolded into a surprise ending.  The orphanage descriptions were disturbing yet poignant.
B0006Z2KYI|4.0|Lubitsch throws logic and caution to the wind in this mad-cap about actors thwarting the Gestapo and the Nazis in 1942 Warsaw.  Jack Benny (who I never had much time for) is perfectly cast as the actor who rises to the occasion; Lombard was never lovelier and rarely funnier; and Robert Stack (one of the great underrated actors) didn't get to do anything this funny again until Airplane -- almost forty years later.<br /><br />It's lots of goofy-action, making fun of the Nazis, some nice set pieces (the irony of having a spy hunted by poles dressed as Nazis), some dark humor (Benny puts the local Gestapo chief on the spot when he names what he claims are Nazi agents, only to discover they have been inadvertently shot), and a screw-ball romance threading it all together.<br /><br />But the danger with satire -- even satire this clever -- is that real life can quickly eclipse it.  This, unfortunately, is exactly what happened to \\"To Be Or Not To Be\\":<br /><br />In 1943 the Nazi's crushed the ghetto uprising, capturing or killing more than 50,000 Jews.  In 1944, while the Red Army watched from across the river, another 150,000-200,000 Poles were killed in the Warsaw uprising.  And our last view of Lombard is in a plane -- she died in a plane-crash before the film was even released.<br /><br />So as great as it might be, \\"To Be Or Not To Be\\" is a movie I can't enjoy.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Exciting plot and well developed characters.  This book was hard to put down once I started reading it.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries.
B00CPTUN5G|3.0|I thought the movie was okay. I'm an adult MLP fan, and my 3 year old likes the MLP cartoons too. I was very dubious about the movie because of the stick thin arms and legs on the awkward looking Equestria Girls, and the Mean Girls/Popular Girl high school plot. It's fun to see the pony equivalents as humans, but I did find the anorexic girls to be ugly to look at and the zombie/demon thing thing towards the end to be very jarring. I'd watch it again for entertainment, but I wouldn't let my daughter watch it, she's too young and wouldn't understand why the girls are so skinny, similar to the Monster High dolls. (Anorexia is hitting girls younger and younger, and I know a girl who was diagnosed at age 11, so I want to shield my children from the overly unrealistic body types) The characters look much cuter and more interesting as ponies in Equestria, so we'll stick to that.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have had a good time for the 10 levels offered.  I look forward to the next set of upgrades.  Hope they are soon.
B00CKOQC9C|4.0|Worth reading, interesting to think what the world thought Mars would be like.  That said, it can certainly be taken as an example of how we might inhabit any new world<br /><br />Good style, easy to read.  I would recommend to a friend without hesitation.
0307895475|3.0|This guide is decent, but not very detailed in terms of actual gameplay. When I got stuck I was better off searching the internet because the quest guides didn't actually help me through the sticky parts. There's a lot of details about some things which are interesting but not that important to the game, yet the quest guides are super vague. I feel like this is a great collectors item for a Skyrim fan but if you want actual help playing the game, you're better off using the internet.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Worth reading, good twist on the standard zombie tale.<br /><br />Good style, easy to read.  I would recommend to a friend without hesitation.
B00A2H9P98|4.0|The capital of the United States, Washington D.C., which happens to be one of the most recognizable cities in the entire world, has not fared very well on film in recent memory.  For whatever reason, filmmakers seem to be intrigued with the idea of toying with the famous D.C. buildings and monuments - not to mention the politicians that work there.  In notorious fashion, the White House and D.C. were destroyed in Independence Day by aliens, while the city also took a beating from Mother Nature in the natural disaster film, 2012.  More recently, Cobra Commander conquered the President's mansion from within, ultimately leading to a battle to save the country on the front lawn in G.I. Joe: Retaliation.  Also recently, a former ex-Korean terrorist group stormed the gates of the White House and captured the President of the United States, leading to a devastating battle that severely damaged the White House in Olympus Has Fallen.  Now, just a few months later, the White House and the Capitol building are under attack in the action flick, White House Down.<br /><br />Directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, 2012), White House Down stars Channing Tatum as John Cale, a US Capital Police officer takes his daughter, Emily (Joey King), to the White House while he applies for a position on the White House Secret Service.  It's business and politics as usual at the White House, at least until President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) is suddenly betrayed by the Head of the Presidential Detail, Martin Walker (James Woods), who blames Sawyer for the death of his son while in Iran on a military mission.  Walker allows a team of American right-wing radicals to occupy the White House, taking several hostages and killing everyone else in the building - except the elusive John Cale.  Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jason Clarke, Richard Jenkins, and Jimmi Simpson also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />Obviously, the premise of a film like this is to focus more on the entertainment value and less on it being realistic - so let's just say this now and get it out of the way:  White House Down is far-fetched from the get-go and the scenarios within it are hokey and extremely unlikely.  In any event, movie-goers seem to enjoy the idea of Washington D.C. being occupied and used as a battleground.  However, the difference between this film and the most recent White House action flick, Olympus Has Fallen, is that White House Down pokes fun at the fact that this a fake storyline.  What does that mean exactly?  White House Down features a moderate amount of semi-playful comedy, while Olympus Has Fallen tried to keep a \\"straight face\\" for the entirety of its tale.  For example, how can you not find humor in the fact that Jamie Foxx's character tries to put together a rocket launcher in the back of a limo while Channing Tatum is driving and doing donuts on the front lawn of the White House?  It just sounds ludicrous to write it, yet it's mostly a serious scene in the film, which obviously takes a few brief moments to be comical, basically embracing the absurdity of the situation.  And, this is just one of the many ironic events throughout the course of the film that makes it so enjoyable.<br /><br />The cast should also receive quite a bit of credit for making this film enjoyable, along with story-writer James Vanderbilt.  When you first get a glimpse of him in action, Channing Tatum will instantly remind you of Bruce Willis (in his prime) as John McClain.  Since it is an action film, Tatum doesn't offer up very much in the drama department, but he does pull off the role of action star quite well, taking it to the bad guys in Steven Seagal-like fashion.  Tatum's co-star, Jamie Foxx, does his Barack Obama impersonation as a Democrat president that chews Nicotine Gum, has heavy admiration for Abraham Lincoln, and enjoys basketball.  At first, it's difficult to imagine Jamie Foxx as President of the United States, but the Academy Award winning actor quickly puts any doubt to rest and thrives in the role as the leader of the free world.<br /><br />Even though the star-power is alive and well, the role of the villain is a bit lacking.  James Woods' character is supposed to convince viewers that a man who has devoted his entire career to protecting the President is capable of the highest form of treason.  The character is necessary for the plot in order to let the \\"bad guys\\" in the front door, but there's really no reason for Wood's character to be preparing for retirement or to be suffering from terminal cancer.  Still, in his eyes - there's no better time for revenge, though not against America, but against the \\"evil\\" known as the Middle East (where his son was killed in action).  To match Channing Tatum's youth and physicality, Jason Clarke fills the role of the maniacal main henchmen, making for a few knock-down, throw-down scenes between the pair.  A rising star in Hollywood, Clark has been earning himself some fairly prominent roles recently in successful flicks, including Lawless, Zero Dark Thirty, and The Great Gatsby.<br /><br />Overall, Channing Tatum takes a large stride in his effort to become the next action star, while also adding another successful summer blockbuster to his resume.  Further bright spots in the film include a historical theme of American resiliency, not to mention a patriotic ending that is reminiscent of Jerry Bruckheimer's The Rock.  White House Down would have made the perfect Die Hard sequel with a plot comparable to the original Die Hard (only on a grander scale).  The film is not only full of action, ironic humor, and politics - it also contains quite a bit of informative knowledge about the history of the White House.  While the film does receive high marks for entertainment (and is one of the most entertaining summer blockbuster thus far in the summer of 2013), it still features a recycled plot that's been beaten to death.  Regardless, the positives drown out the negatives, making White House Down a solid, must-see film.<br /><br />Grade:  B<br />FNDNreview.comt to rest and thrives in the role as the leader of the free world.<br /><br />Even though the star-power is alive and well, the role of the villain is a bit lacking.

B00371V6SE|4.0|I liked the story and would read other novels by Nicholas Sparks on the strength and originality of this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was truly amazing! Not as good as the first, I have to say, but it was amazing! I definitely recommend reading the book before seeing the movie.<br />~ Janaya
B0095VP8D4|5.0|The AMD A10 5800k is a very fast processor. I currently have it overclocked to 4.3mhz with stock cooling and it runs well. Easily rivals the i7. Not to mention the built in GPU and be xFired to your compatible graphics card allowing seamless gaming. I'm very impressed with this processor.
B000QI2ZWW|1.0|Not at all impressed.  I had to turn this off because it was very inappropriate for my children to watch.  The last thing a three year old and five year old need to learn is the song \\"I want to sex you up,\\" a modified version of which is in the opening number.  I am horrified that this was in a movie made for kids.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I were completely hooked after watching season one.  The character development is great.  The show has all the scandals and excitement of an HBO series without the violence and R rated language.
1582701709|4.0|The book is good but a little repetitive. The uplifting you receive is well worth the repetition. Overall the good outweighs the bad. Quite a few have taken this book to heart and I can understand why.
1442486929|2.0|The movie came out recently, and then I saw the book at the library. It looked like something my seven year old might enjoy with the fairies and stuff. So I read the book, then watched the movie, and decided the book wasn't good enough for him.<br /><br />Cons of the book:<br /><br />13 year old girl uses crass language throughout<br />9 year old boy disobeys and mom \\"pretended not to notice\\" (this theme is carried throughout the book)<br /><br />Probably when he's old enough to deal with the book, it will be beneath him.<br /><br />Even without the angry, disobedient boy, I can't justify exposing my seven year old to teen language. I would have to do some definite sharpie magic to mark out the inappropriate language.
B0076DELIG|4.0|This is the same author as the Lincoln lawyer series, which is one of my favorites. I am beginning to enjoy Harry as well. He comes from a darker space but his uphill climb is worth the trip.
B00AS1Q93S|1.0|Tom Cruise is so wrong to playJack Reacher. Reacher is 6'5'' and Cruise is 5' 7''  Cruise is not tough enough. I have read every Jack Reacher book .Cruise is wrong wrong. Please dont do this again!<br />Lois  Taylor
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It is clear John Grisham knows how to write a great book. His stories stick to his passion, law, and anyone who enjoys lawyer stories will enjoy this one. The main character is a lawyer who get sent to prison. Interesting twist.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Y'know, I didn't think there would be much to this book. After reading the advertising on it I expected a hokey throw-away of a story. But what the heck- maybe it'll make a good bathroom reader? This thing grabbed me almost immediately! I missed supper and bedtime. I just couldn't put it down! Finished it in record time. Now I regret not having taken more time to savor the read. Do yourself a favor- take breaks.<br />Now, Shakespeare it is not. Ready Player One is mostly a comic thriller with large nostalgic overtones for those of us who lived through the late '70's and the '80's. However, it also has a futuristic bite and dares to explore the nature of friendship and prejudice. Some of the themes are presented in the best way- as entertainment. There doesn't seem to be any agenda here except to have fun, but Ernest Cline appears to be an author who just can't help having something to say. In this book I found the most serious of subjects usually framed by the most ridiculous, and nothing ever felt preachy.<br />All in all I'd recommend this book to almost anyone.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|For a change, I saw the movie before I read the book. I should have done it the old way as the book offers more character building and  lets you know how we got there. The movie is very good, as is the movie.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Very thoughtfully done, It will be one of those records that if and when You get tired of playing, You will put it on the shelf, then pull it back out from time to time and listen to it again. I believe Miss Faeltskog did this deliberately.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|No real news here. The story is dragged out a little and the detail would probably be appreciated more by a military person. I bought it because I think he is a hero and I wanted to support him. A good, thorough account of the story you already know but worth the effort.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is really fun and you don't have to buy gems because after each level you get another gem. You should get it.
B009JCL58G|5.0|The movie &#34;Cloud Atlas&#34; would not have been what it was if it were not for the music behind it.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|The doll is lifelike, perfect size, and I love the accessories available! I bought the feeding accessories! My granddaughter will love her 1st doll!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This story kept me captivated all vacation long.  Cannot wait to read what happens next. Hope the next book comes out soon.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love love LOVE this series. Really hoping the next book comes out soon.  Sylvia Day did a fantastic job with these series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super fun i play it every day it changes its area every month so one month it will be in miami then it will be in paris then rome and its awsome
B007EECSFA|5.0|Spellbinding story, hated to see it end. Great story line, moved effortlessly between decades to tell stories of the characters.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I didn't exactly hate this book but it was still awful. The story was so out of context for the characters. It was a mistake from beginning to end. I was so excited for this book to come out. I feel like I over paid. It should have been in the 3.99 or less section. Emphasis on less. I can usually stay up all night reading a Sookie Stackhouse book. This one just fell short and I let it drag out for several days. I know the author said it was her story to end as she pleased but this ending for Sookie was bad. Don't buy this book. Borrow it from your library. Or someone who was dumb enough to pre-order at full price.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Great, suspense-filled. enjoyed every word. amazing how it fits right in with the current events at NSA. Wish he had written more books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This rock's!<br /><br />This is such an  awesome game! I love it so much I play it every day and I love it!<br />I love this game and I have to tell you about it.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Angry birds got nothing on this game. You can cruise through most levels ok, but if you want to get the stars you got to think!  Definitely worth the price but a few more levels would be nice.
140191716X|5.0|awesome book to own along with the tarot cards
0812550706|5.0|I read this when I was a teenager and loved it. I just finished reading it again and it was better than I remembered. A great book to share with your entire family.
B00821OX98|5.0|they advertised it in the movie theaters. great show, watching it on regular tv now had to play catch up.
B000A6EXNO|4.0|I recently purchased this product and use it on my Nikon D800.  I think it works great.  I can finally see through the view finder without additional reflections!  Before I put my camera back in my camera bag, I gently push in on the edges of the rubber eye cup to flatten it onto the back of the camera so it doesn't catch on anything.  I would recommend this product for various types of photography.  I use it mainly in the field for landscape photography.  Examples on my Bridger Photo Facebook page.
B002ZHKZD8|3.0|This is the worst of the trilogy.  The shaky camera work is so bad that it makes the Desh fighting and NY chase scenes confusing and much less enjoyable.  If you can forgive the shaky camera, you might be offended by the even shakier plot/logic.  Asides from the very weak reason why Bourne gets entangle with CIA again, I can't believe two experienced CIA ex-agents (Bourne and Nicky) will be stupid enough to try to trick Desh - a CIA operative - into leading them to the target.  One would think Desh has his own handler, so why would he even listen to Nicky DURING a mission? Why would Desh even follow Nicky's instruction without first verify her identity with higher authority - that's assume operatives don't go silent during missions?  And then, there's the stupid CIA office in the middle of NY City with transparent, non-bulletproof windows.  Does the movie director really believe US is so stupid that it hosts top-secret documents in such \\"open\\" environment? Does the movie director really believe CIA offices will have such trivial security that Bourne can go in-and-out without problem?
B000IZA9NU|3.0|Maybe its just me but my interest level has only waned since Wrath of Khan.  Most of the movies since then seem to try to be cerebral and chic-flickish but wind up being too slow.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|If you are looking for action, this movie is for you! If you are one of those folks who sit around and analyze a movie, pick something else. The story line is great! There is something happening throughout the entire movie. I'm glad they left it open for still another sequel--&#34;The Best Day to Die Hard&#34;??
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This has to be one of the best sci-fi books I've read in a long time. In fact, when I finished the story of Holston, I told a friend that Hugh Howey spun a tale that seemed like it could have been part of Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles. Howey's characters are incredibly real, and I found myself feeling their pain and fears. The world of the Silo is so wonderfully created that, after reading before bed, I'd often dream that I lived there (those weren't great dreams). I finished this last night and have already started reading Shift. Hugh Howey definitely has me hooked, and I'm looking forward to reading more from him.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It's the type of story where you have great empathy for both characters and you keep having a change of heart as to the outcome.  I have recommended this book to all my friends and I am now reading another book by the same author.  Read it, you won't be sorry.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome fun game. It exercises the mind as well as being fun. I look toward to escaping more floors in the future.
B00BWLKTOS|4.0|This was a great follow up album to their debut album. It is always fun listening to a popular song with a different spin on it. Their music is incredibly good!
B009XHAM8G|1.0|Not that original.  Not that interesting, and not what I had expected.  I would not recommend this to another reader.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Loved this movie and all the excellent bonus materials. It will remain a vital part of my classic movie collection.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun game.  hard enough to keep me interested.  not so hard that i get frustrated and quit.  can't wait for more floors.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I really like tracks 1-4.  Didn't hear a good track after that.  Other than Wilton playing the usual riffs, I was severely disappointed (except for Rockenfield).  I have listened to the album ten times.  It is missing something.  Perhaps if Tate collaborated more with the band something special could have happened here.  What's that song about the \\"lost and found\\"???  I think I like that one.  I am in the middle here but i will say that after listening to both albums, i would rather listen to Frequency Unknown.  Most of the songs are good and some are really good (ok i don't like slave and dare).  Maybe not completely (some do) QR sounding, but as i mentioned to my brother, he hated Empire when it came out(not that i am comparing FU to Empire) but can you really compare one QR album to the next?  That is the thing I love about them.  Always exploring.  You cannot say one album sounds like the next.  And no I am not on Geoff's junk.<br /><br />Just read a review that says this is the best QR album since Mindcrime and another since Empire.  Really??????????????  No dude.<br /><br />Wow, i should have taken my own advice, after 20 listens it's pretty damn good. 30 minutes sucks tho
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My mom let me download the application on the kindle and I like playing it there instead of my smart phone
B00CF34B2I|4.0|The game itself it's great! But I had to download it three times, and even now the only way to open the app is to go to the game store and select open...meaning I basically need Internet if I want to play. this is by far the worst platform to play on!The game itself is great, but I really want to enjoy this on my kindle and I can not.....glad I have an Xbox to play it on. (I did buy it twice.)
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I enjoyed using this updated version of angry birds there is more pigs and new boards. I like playing with my friends
B00B3L3RPA|5.0|Compelling story. I wish there was a film version that captured all the elements of the book. Thank you Amazon.
1400095204|4.0|I love african literature! Adichie wrote an excellent novel that leaves the reader in deep reflection. I recommend this book
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have a hard time finding a series of shows to watch that will truly and wholly capture my attention, but this show has successfully done so! There's scandal but no profanity and crazy family dynamics. Must watch! Especially the UK version.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this series! I'm almost sad that I've finished.  Good job and I look forward to more novels from this author!
B00181JGI2|3.0|The movie is hilarious.  I enjoyed the performance of the cast, this truly is a comedy classic. Amazon's streaming crashed about an hour in and then kept crashing. I stream a lot of content and rarely have problems. At one point to test the connection on my end I started streaming content from Netflix and had no problems. I went back to Amazon and the movie kept crashing. If you are going to charge good money for a product you have to be able to deliver Amazon!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book allows the reader to see further development of both the characters and their relationship. You can feel the love Gideon has for Ava making every female reader envious of her.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I heard Mr. Fogerty interviewed  on Marc Maron's podcast and decided to give this CD a try. I gotta say I listen to it more than any other CD in my collection. John is a true music legend who still has his chops. He still sings as good as ever and he has picked a great group of people to join him in this latest effort. I love the fact that he had the guest artist pick the song they wanted to perform the way they wanted to perform it. This approach adds new life to songs we have all heard countless times before.  This is a terrific CD worth every penny.<br /> ROCK ON JOHN!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This was a really good book. I loved the action and the twists he put into the book. I really love the history and science. It's really cool!!
B005LJITS0|4.0|Was a fair movie. The online rental was easy to stream through our Roku. Kids liked it the best. Will lookinto streaming more its great and cost is good.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A movie, especially a suspense drama, that keeps your attention throughout is often a very good movie. When it is based on well known historical events maintaining interest, let alone suspense is an even greater challenge. Ben Affleck pulled off a very difficult feat.<br /><br />Even if you're familiar with the story and remember Americans singing &#34;Oh Canada&#34;, you'll find this movie engaging, entertaining and well acted. That the casting put such capable actors, almost impersonators, in the roles of the &#34;hostages&#34; and key government officials allowed the blending of live action and historical footage that enhances the feeling of &#34;being there&#34;.<br /><br />Well worth the money and time.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|A very good intro to the characters. The story is more important in how the reader learns about everyone in Longmire's life and Longmire himself. For those who feel that the mystery is interrupted by too much description the answer is that this mystery series is a large portion novel and a smaller part mystery.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I loved the first books in the series, but was sad to say this one didn't pick up where it left off excitement wise, didn't seem to refresh memory well, and ended even worse! All of a sudden I turned the page and that was all she wrote! Nothing built up to make me look forward to yet another book... I waited and watched for this one to come out but honestly the way this ended, I'm not sure I care what comes next for the two love birds... Not worth waiting to find out, if I hear about the next book I will read it but I don't expect to track its arrival like I did this one.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is such a good read! I never knew what to expect next, and the main character is so different from what I am used to, but I absolutely loved this book! I couldn't put it down, and I highly recommend it!!!
030758836X|2.0|All the characters were thoroughly unlikeable and psycho, and the ending was totally unsatisfactory. I would not recommend it to any of my friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has exceeded my expectations. When i downloaded this game, i didnt know what to expect. But now this is the game i usally play when im bored
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Awesome cool BadAss Different  say's IncubusJaXXX from San Antonio Texas try the spear guys out, it has a RPG like real with ability to level up many types of offensive and defensive abilities.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a relly fun game alos the hame can get hard sometimes but it is alot of fun i love it
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is great! Sometimes it does freeze but never loses progress. I started this game not awhile ago. Probably about 2 weeks. I am already really far. The only thing I do not like would be the mystery seeds. They cost WAY too many sand dollars, and wastes my algae. 99% of the time my mystery seeds don't grow to rare plants. And I have homework and quests that say stuff like &quot;Grow a rare plant from a mystery seed&quot; and I can never pass them.
B007885IJU|5.0|It worked perfectly, thank you! I bought it as a gift and my friend was in love with the vinyl!
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|EVERY TIME I  OPEN THE APP IT POPS OUT A ADD SO IT STARTS LAGGING  OUT THEN IT  STOPS AND TURNS OFF THE DEVICE
B008XKSW7M|5.0|It was just a funny take on being pregnant and the dad's were awesome. it really made me laugh the whole time
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i think this game is awsome because it feels like you are actually taking care of your own horse aand the reason why i think is because y<br />the horse realistic.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great movie collection. My fiance is a fanatic. We enjoyed watching the whole series over again, remembering good ol' times at Hogwarts!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was one of the best games I've ever played! I cannot wait for the second one to come out! (Which may or may not be a rumour) this is one of those games that you never wanted to end! :)
B001ECDVKE|5.0|Mars Attacks is an old favorite to watch when someone needs to relax at home and have a fun evening of laughter.  I do recommend it to all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Unlike a lot of games on the kindle fire, you can play as many times a day as you want. It's a good thing too because it's super fun and addicting. It puts me in the mind of crash bandicoot, so if you're a fan of that you'll probably enjoy this game as well.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Fast paced, no way to slow down. But that isn't the way the game is played. Hang on tight and rip through the swamp fast as you can, collect money bags and parlay that cash into goods. Parlay the goods back into cash to up your score. Running down chickens is OK, running down other boats (and cops) is way more fun.......
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Connects easily to my TV.  Great price compared to what was available in my local stores.  Just one cable  (with my charger) and can watch movies clear as can be.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I ordered the SKX007K (malaysian) version from Amazon, it was delivered overseas by \\"Adeline\\" from Sweden. The watch arrived sooner than announced, in perfect condition.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- True divers watch, ISO rated, 200M WR<br />- Beautiful design. The brushed/polished stainless steel finish, black dial and bezel plus rubber strap is masculine, sporty and elegant.<br />- Seiko pedigree: centennial tradition, in-house manufacture automatic movement. Heir to a reputable line of divers watches. Not many brands can claim all those.<br />- Original design. This watch doesn't try to imitate other brand divers' -- It's proudly 100% Seiko.<br />- Amazing value. Swiss brands charge thousands of dollars for comparable watches. You get all that from Seiko for a couple hundreds.<br />- Pretty accurate for an automatic. I've had this watch for over five months now, and needed to readjust the time just a couple of times.<br />- Mine came with spanish/english day/date, a plus for me.<br />- Lume is impressive. Lasts long enough to see it when I wake up. Best lume ever among the watches I've owned.<br />- Malaysian version (SKX007K) comes with a cleaner dial. The face of the Japanese version (SKX007J) has some extra text, i.e. \\"21 jewels\\" and \\"Japan Made\\". Malaysian and Japanese versions are virtually identical, and are made by the same type of robotic factories, so there's no real difference between them, except for the price (Taxes?) If you really need that tiny \\"Japan Made\\" in the dial, then go for the SKX007J<br />- Wide variety of aftermarket straps and bracelets for this model.<br />- Hardlex crystal is fine, better than mineral crystal. No scratches so far. Personally, I can't tell the difference from sapphire.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Non-hackable, non manual winding movement. That adds a little extra work to set the time. You really shouldn't roll the crown backwards on a non-hacking automatic movement, as it can affect the mechanism. To set the time properly, you should set the day-date to yesterday, then roll the crown forward past 12:00 AM to change the date, then set the correct time. Never roll the crown backwards! And you simply can't set the time accurately up to the second. No way.<br />- Rubber strap is a little stiff, not quite comfortable at first. Gets better in a few weeks if you manage to endure it.<br />- Strap is maybe a little too long, but you're supposed to be able to wear it over a wetsuit, anyway.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is an automatic, mechanical watch. Many of the complains I read about automatics are out of ignorance. Automatics are mechanical watches that wind themselves with the natural movement of the arm (hence the name). In order to keep good time, you have to wear them every day to keep them full wound. Just don't expect them to be atomic clocks. You will need to set the correct time every now and then, maybe once a month or so. This is part of owning a mechanical watch. And has been for centuries before quartz watches.<br /><br />Automatic divers have other advantages to them: you will never need to open them to change batteries, which is a good thing in a divers' watch. And Seiko has a reputation for making durable watches. You can expect them to work for 20+ years. My dad's did.<br /><br />Beautiful, original design, pedigree, good lume, true divers watch. All this probably makes the best well spent 200 $ in a watch, ever. Enjoy!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|My son is an avid reader and he loves this series.  He highly recommends it for it's entertainment.  He's learning a lot of mythology in the process which is a bonus.  He is 10 with an advanced reading level.  I'd say its great for ages 10-18 or anyone.  I've enjoyed the Rick Riordan books I've read.  Very engaging writing style.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is timeless. It will be popular 5, 10, 25, 50 years from now. As always, the book is better than the movie. Bring on book 2....
B0053TMP24|5.0|My son is an avid reader and he loves all the Rick Riordan books. We've read a few together and I can see why he loves them.  He reads and re-reads them at length.  As a parent I appreciate the Mythological/Historical material included.  He is getting great entertainment while also learning.  The Heroes of Olympus series is his favorite.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The shocking ending is the payoff. As a parent , I found the concept of a child accused of a crime thought-provoking. As the wife of a Federal investigator , I was riveted. What would I do? I was shocked by the ending which left me restless with the moral and ethical dilemmas presented. All of my college age kids carry a knife. It is well within legal lengths. Defending Jacob is thought provoking especially once all is revealed. I can't wait to discuss it at bookclub. I hope you enjoy reading it too!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian Flynn has fast become one of my favorite authors.  After reading GONE GIRL,  I have not beenable to get enough of her.  I believe SHARP OBJECTS was her first book.  I'm not reading DARK PLACES which is even better than this one.<br />I continue to be amazed at her creativity.  Who thinks of these things?
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I first played this on Kongregate, and it has been one of my favorite tower defense games ever since. I was happy when I found it had been put on the Amazon store, I bought it instantly.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|The OUTLIERS is one of the few books I can read over again.  It has changed the way I see the world in so many ways.  It is fascinating; everyone should read it.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have a few versions for Xbox live which got me to purchase physical magic cards and now on my kindle fire HD....unreal! Smooth and addicting, works like a charm with the touch screen.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I really like this until it booted me off the ship and I had to restart the game. I thought it was because I hadn't paid full price, so I bought full version, and I started it again and I got to the point at the bridge and it still made me go back to the first of the game I actually tried it 3 times and gave up. I did purchase the full version on the second try. This is what I was disappointed in, other than that I think it would be a fun game.<br />Thanks Kathy
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book and because of this I refuse to see the movie!! The characters were well written, and story line kept me wanting to read more! The ending was a twist that I didn't see coming!! Definitely a must read!
0425263924|4.0|Out of the Cross series I have enjoyed this one the most. Finally Eva and Gideon aren't arguing over the silliest things and are actually hearing each other, they seem to be choosing their battles.<br />I am looking forward to the next one, hopefully it comes out soon. I am already rereading Entwined.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I can't wait for the next book, Mrs. Day left to many unanswered questions, hopefully the next one will wrap everything up!
B003UBTX72|5.0|Richards seemed to really care about his women more than the others. He stood up when it counted even though drug addled sometimes. I think he is a good guy after reading this and other things about him. Good book and he doesn't  put in the boot even when he could. Nor does he toot his own horn.  Get this book. I also recommend Ronnie's book Ronnie. Although he has since left his wife of 30 years it is no longer up to date.
B001MM28JG|3.0|Well considering I have not watched it because Amazon Instant Video does not have an app for use on my Nexus 7 I cannot watch the darn thing. I really think its a bad move for Amazon to restrict their instant video to their own devices. Not good business.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is a fun and cool game. Will definitely rate this game a five star. Me and my husband love it.
1442359919|5.0|I enjoyed this as a an aduio book, and it was terrific. I had done any of Stephen Kinks books in some time so this was a fine surprise.<br />Audio books are wonderful and it reminds me of when you sat and listened to the radio shows and Joyland is perfect as ana audio book.
0307950689|5.0|Really got caught up in this one!  Started reading and finished in a day and a half!  Well written - one of his best.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun game. It offered more challenges on each new level. Nice surprise from this app.  I am glad I played it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is so much fun every time I'm bored I play this game. It is the perfect time killer and is a really great game for young children to play.
B001QJUX24|4.0|Historical;  well written and well acted.  Supporting actors and actresses were exceptional also.  One of the best &#34;old&#34; movies around.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|well written and researched book set in Ireland with some humor and a  dark tragic side. couldnt wait to finish it to find out if justice would prevail
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I really wanted to see this episode since I missed it and my computer wouldn't play it well from the network's site.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Ok game. You really have to search for the right combination in order to get to the next level. Good luck.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|This game is graphically eye candy and has several modes of control.<br />You steer your boat, you collect booty, you trade - great fun.<br />However, at the speed you're going, it's almost inevitable you WILL hit something as well as miss some things you could've picked up.<br />A great game still :)
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Another Archer cliffhanger written series following his sequel-driven style. A little confusing in terms of an American understanding British politics. Interchangeable cast of characters on par with his Rich Man/Poor Man formula, but still a page turner. 2/3 through it now, and while very enjoyable read, twists and turns in his plotting are getting too predictable. Nice details from history are presented from the small details of the dialog.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Great to see a series based on the man's  perspective! Funny, enlightening and wonderfully entertaining! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Almost too tough. Have to buy credits if you want more than 4 suits, or dismantle one that you've built, but you'll lose whatever \\"money\\" you put into it. Load time is lengthy. Then you have to spend more credits to repair your suit or use a weaker one. Get the game free, you'll have to pay sometime.<br /><br />Watch out. This game locks up frequently, requiring you to reboot your Fire. And you'd better hope that you didn't just spend credits to advance after you've burned through the last of your health, and then accomplished a goal. It will take your credits, but not reward you for achieving your goal. I'm getting tired of losing my progress because the game is buggy. And I do mean \\"BUGGY\\". Sometimes free is not all it's cracked up to be.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|A great story with the right number of twists and turns--not so many your head spins, but just enough to keep you guessing and engaged. I really couldn't put this down!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|And frustrating. Prepare for this game to suck your time away... I found the how to videos on you t tube helpful. They saved my marriage.
B0027MJU00|3.0|This author was new to me and I had trouble getting into the story.  I have nothing further to say about this author or book.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|This show is one of the most satisfying TV experiences I've had in quite a long time. Tatiana Maslany is superb.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I am absolutely enchanted by Pudding Monsters. It has clever puzzles, sharp art, and high production values. It's just plain delightful.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like it . It is a pretty good app.I am using it regularly on my Kindle.Thanks. updates will make it better.
B003F46RVO|5.0|As a teenager, when I first watched this movie, I was mesmerized by all the handsome actors in this movie.  Watching it again all these years later...same reaction :)
B003K1EYM6|1.0|Tried to use the USB connection kit but constantly got an error message that indicated there was not enough power to use it.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I have waited a long time for some new Daft and they never let down... It was amazing hearing them with TRON but I liked seeing them do what they wanted again. DISCO FUNK REVIVAL
B00CM9JKQM|3.0|The album is good, serious and has a lot of honest soul, but it is way too short. The moment its songs start to develop very promising instrumental interludes, they cut them off and they are over. Had they taken the time to develop them more this might have been their best work. I also agree that the sound is not clear.
B009JVSAVM|5.0|We love Big Bang and now we can watch the episodes we want when we want.  BBT makes us laugh so much.  Sometimes it hurts laughing!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As an introvert (and professional speaker and high school teacher), I recommend this book to anyone desiring to deepen their understanding of self. Quiet unlocks the mysteries of our brain without over-complicating the content, revealing how to thrive in an extroverted culture.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|It's Fun, Scary, Sad, Funny, Love, Action. It hits its all the right notes. This is a great movie to have.
B005HED08I|5.0|Hard to tell it was shot nearly 50 years ago! Looked great on the iPad! If you liked it then - you'll be impressed now with the quality of the remastered shows.
B002VUFKG6|3.0|As someone who just got married, this is relevant to me... at the same time, it's heavy and the tagline &#34;A Love Story&#34; is wholly incorrect. A better tagline would be, &#34;a look at marriages of different people Liz knows and has met.&#34; That said, it is interesting but it's not the personal narrative with a driving main character that undergoes change that Eat, Pray, Love is. Having read EPL that's a bit more what I expected. It's an interesting read but at the end of the day, leaves me feeling a bit meh-- on the plus side I'm getting more sleep lately since it is easy to put down.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really made me think. Honestly I had to get some help.. Hopefully I won't need help on the next levels updates ..
6305428352|5.0|Really happy been trying get a copy of this movie for a long time,<br />arrived when it said it was going to with no problems
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Wish that there were more levels.  Fun to watch the kids try and figure out why things don't always work as expected.<br /><br />Fun to explore and figure out how to escape the floors.
B00005TQKQ|5.0|I ordered this head cleaner for my video recorder.  I hadn't cleaned it in some time.  Have used it once already and works great as far as I can tell.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|He was my favorite on Idol, and this does not disappoint. Well worth the price, and i look forward to his next collection

B00280LYIC|5.0|Exceptional i didn't see the ending coming! Very good for the people who want fantasy thrillers in the modern world<br />An exceptional twisted ending
B00BRUYQFC|3.0|This cd has a few catchy numbers but it does not compare to his last cd. JT doesn't quite have his &#34;sexy back.&#34;
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I personally am going broke buying all the separate princesses, but whatever makes the human princess happy that's the goal.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I bought this for my husband but he has trouble keeping it out of my hands!  We tested the accuracy several times after we got the Bushnell and always found it on the mark.  It is light, easy to use and very accurate.  I am beginning to get a better feel for what clubs I hit best at what range and just recently broke 100 for the first time (93)!  My husband consistently hover between 78-80.  Who knew that such a simple piece of equipment could help so much!  But then I am still new to golf.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|We bought this CD primarily for the wonderful arrangement of Bye Bye Blackbird, but we were pleasantly surprised to get a recording that is full of quality easy listening music. We wanted a new CD to use as background music for drinks and dinner, and this fills the bill perfectly because it doesn't have any high-energy tracks to ruin the mood. Personally, I don't think the CD bears more than one playing with the idea of concentrating on the music itself. This is not a put-down. There is room for all kinds of CDs and this one has exactly the type of music we were looking for.
B00746O3X8|2.0|The emergency fail/safe strap could not be engaged as there was no way to loop it to the harness.  I will never use this product.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|WILL INHERIT THE THRONE ONCE THE KING steps down!!!! THE LEGACY WILL ENDURE THE KINGDOM IS SECURE.. HEAD WEST YOUNG RAPPERS LOL
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome!! Highly addictive.  I just cant stop playing this game.  I love when it changes venues and gives me new scenery! !!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Even if you expect some steamy BDSM action, you'll be disappointed - to say the least. There's literally NOTHING that this brick offers. It's actually worse than the Twilight vampires. There would be perhaps one slight chance of redemption for this book, if it were written as a pastiche, deliberately playing upon the exaggerated emotional naivety and utterly unrealistic assumtions regarding all the parameters of the main male protagonist. Meanwhile, it's entirely opposite - serious to the point of ridiculousness. Bleh!!! Total waste of money.
B0072OFM28|2.0|Still a good show but the sear balls and stupidity to recast spartacus to a lesser actor is insulting and irritating ruins the feel of the show
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day continued the Crossfire drama with a moving addition to the first two books. I can't wait for the next book!
B00AEFY66U|3.0|The movie was very slow, since seeing the new version.<br />Although the acting was good, it was too long and boring.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I work at a restaurant that has people sign our iPad with a stylus 24/7. Every stylus we tried lasted about 2 weeks before it stopped responding. I bought the Cosmonaut in April and it is still working perfectly in June. Strongly recommend for its durability. It should be noted that the tip is squishy, which I didn't realize when I bought it. But that shouldn't detract anyone from buying it, as it is great.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging but not too hard.<br />I would like to see more levels. Still, it was fun and kept my interest.
B00992CF6W|5.0|By aidan.<br />  I think that the game needs a updated SO you can switch from creative to survival and free moods
B001DF68MA|5.0|I was worried reading the reviews about the size. I bit the bullet and ordered it as it would be perfect for our situation ... if it fits.<br />The box came and was small but I was prepared for that. The item inside is very simple to install yet it does take time due to the need to use two tools at the same time to tighten the crossbar bolts to the seat post and headset. Once installed it is very secure as long as it is done properly. There are others that say that the seat wobbles but you need to be sure the bolt is tight and it will not wobble. I have a 26lb almost 2 year old and I was afraid he would  be uncomfortable....wrong. He loves it and fits very well with some room to grow. My 34 lb almost 4 yr old daughter insisted on a ride as well and I was again afraid she would not fit....wrong again....She loved it and I do feel that I could ride her in the seat without any problems what so ever. Overall, my family loves this seat. How much time we are able to use it is up in the air but at such a great price it is worth every penny. Kudos to a great design.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice graphics and music. Only some time touch screen does not work. But may be it's my kindle' s problem. Levels r easy
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|If you struggle against those who disparage you, if self-doubt tries to defeat you, if you give all you believe you have but wonder if it's enough, The History of The Eagles will reaffirm that integrity, the will to succeed, the will to practice, study, practice, innovate, practice, rehearse, practice until you feel exhausted, and if you accept that the most accomplished person can stumble and face a dire future, then you will appreciate all The Eagles endured to maintain the excellence and elegance of - The Eagles.  From humble beginnings these men lifted themselves to stardom that few success-seekers attain. You will fall in love with the gentleness, the honesty, and the natural humility of Henley, Frey, Walsh, Schmitt, Smith, Crago, Lewis, Thompson, Meisner, the four musicians of the &#34;Mighty Horns&#34; as well as talented Felder's inability to understand what is best for - The Eagles..
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie will never grow old.  I believe it has become a classic.  I like to give it in a gift basket to new parents or newlyweds.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|The Eagles, invited to Aspen CO after a 14 year separation, reunited and performed to an appreciative audience and proved The Eagles retained their star-status among Earth's most talented musicians, singers, and songwriters. The performers humanness as well as their sharpened-to-perfection honed skills became evident as the concert unfolded.  The Eagles do not jump around the stage as though they were circus clowns or gymnasts, rather they justify their popularity with powerful lyric compositions that seem to touch all who hear them, unique music, instrument mastery from drum\percussion perfection, guitar skills from steel through bass, and keyboard.  That they connect with viewers and listeners is evident.  If it were possible to give The Eagles an extra plus rating, I'd do so.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun. Has lots of things to explore. Also the game offers a twist on games similar to it.it offers the use of vehicles
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Pretty cool.<br />My son got me hooked, so now I have to beat his score. I also realize that my twelve year old son is making me work for it! It is good clean fun.
B00174TKGI|4.0|I'm not particularly fond of Russell Crowe, but when he came together with Ridley Scott, some terrific movies got made. Throw Denzel Washington into the mix and you have the makings of an epic drama. American Gangster was beloved by critics and the academy alike, but it also received negative reviews from the people the story was based on, who claimed it was ninety percent fiction. The film takes almost 3 hours to tell us the story of Frank Lucas, a man who was mentored by the great Bumpy Johnson, and ran Harlem, along with much of the heroin on the east coast from 1969 to 1977. In passed years, even prior to this film, Frank Lucas has been immortalized as some kind of hero. Many believe that he kept the people of Harlem out of poverty and ultimately did the right thing, once his conscience caught up with him. The film American Gangster seems to agree with this take on the story and portray Lucas as a man larger than life, who you want to like, despite his criminal activity. The truth is that Lucas was no hero, as for a decade he ran a crew as large as any organized crime family, and he was responsible for the deaths of thousands of people who overdosed on his junk. When Lucas turned states evidence, leading to the arrest of 150 people, most of whom were corrupt officials in New York City, it had nothing to do with his conscience, he just wanted to stay out of jail. That's not how it portrayed and was the only thing that really kept this film from getting a five star rating. American Gangster is shot much in the same style as Heat, with a large cast and fasting moving scenes. Denzel Washington is always good, but when he's playing someone from his own community he really steps it up to a whole other level. Washington absolutely should have received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Lucas. Regardless of how true the story may have been, Washington was just amazing. Denzel is paired with Russell Crowe, who portrays the man who is chasing him, a very deep and interesting man that seemed to fit Crowe's personality to a tee. American Gangster is a long, fast moving story, that may not be all that accurate, but you will be hard pressed to find a better cast then the one they had and for that, American Gangster is labeled as a must see movie.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I loved the first two books in the Crossfire series! I could not wait until this book was released. This book just was not a page turner for me. Don't get me wrong I love the chemistry between Gideon & Eva, but there was not anything interesting really going on. I hope the next book is more suspenseful & not the same old, same old.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love Sylvia Day and the character's in the Crossfire series. This book was a super easy read, once I started it I couldnt put it down until I was finished!! Cant wait for the next two in the series
B009R659L8|5.0|You can see pieces of the puzzle, but don't quite figure it out .... then when you think you did, you didn't!
0345803485|4.0|The Good: A widely received, well known book that takes some of the stigma off alternative sexual relations? Fantastic. That alone makes this book worth it. This book does very well to introduce less carnally adventurous people to something out there they wouldn't even consider otherwise. It's an easy read, quick and can get nice and hot when the time comes.<br /><br />The Bad: This is one of those books I liked despite my myriad of complaints. What the heck is Ana's issue? Seriously, she's going along with Christan's wants because he's attractive? Yet managed to keep her virginity as long as she had before him? Unbelievable. And why does Christian have to me messed up in the head? He couldn't just be some normal guy into kink? There has to be a messed up reason? And while Ana's willing to go along with his wants, she is ultimately more focused on changing him so that he accepts the relationship she wants after having been told point blank that it's this or nothing. There is a lot to be said about a healthy, open minded attitude to sex, but this book is not that.
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|I'm embarrased to say the subject matter in this movie made me feel quite uncomfortable.  Although knowing this was based on at true story is what kept me watching.  I would recommend it as a rental but glad I didn't pay movie theater prices.
0345803485|3.0|This is ok but i don't know how it made the best seller list. I read the book Paranoia and The Fickle Finger of Fate by Arlow Grant and found it to be one of the best books I have read in a long time. Why isn't this on the best seller list? Fifty shades is just another romance novel like all the others.
B0039PPW60|5.0|Amazed by the built in effects. Clean sound. Good for beginner who want to learn mixing and recording with USB. Would love to buy another one with more input.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is AWESOME! It is so cool. I love it and it you can take care o  your own horse and it is your responsibility. It's so COOL!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow is definitely my favorite app.  It is really fun and kind of hard, but not to the point of being not fun. This game involes connecting colored dots, but not overlapping them and filling every square. I definitely suggest getting hints, if you are like me, you will need them.

0525457585|5.0|It's official. The Neverending Story is my favourite novel ever. I first learned about this book when I saw the film of the same name - a film that I thought was pretty awful, I'll have you know. But I could see in the film a basic idea that had a fantastic appeal: a book which, as you read it, becomes a real world that you can enter. I also found out that it had been a bestseller in Germany for years. It definitely seemed like a good idea to read it, so I went and found it and got started.<br /><br />A young boy, Bastian, who lives with his widower father, is being chased one day by the bullies from his school. He escapes from his tormentors by ducking into a bookshop, and finds a book entitled The Neverending Story. Entranced by the title, he steals and runs. Later, still hiding from the bullies, he reads the book and gets immersed in it.<br /><br />This story within a story, the book that bastion reads while hiding, involves a void which is rapidly developing the land of Fantastica. The Nothing, as it is called, must be stopped, but no force or weapon can affect it. It also emerges that the Empress of Fantastica is sick and dying along with her kingdom.<br /><br />At one point while reading Bastian is scared for the characters, who are in some kind of danger, and actually screams. His scream is heard by the characters in the book.<br /><br />Atreju, a young boy who is sent on a quest to combat the Nothing, learns that only someone from outside of Fantastica can stop it, saving Fantastica and the Empress. As he reads, Bastian realises that he could save them, if only he could get into the story. And, of course, that is exactly what happens. Bastion enters the book and proves to be the hero that the Empress needed.<br /><br />The film follows more or less the same story, and this was where it ended. Bastian saves the world, and everybody's happy.<br /><br />But in the book, this is the halfway point, where things begin to get really interesting. The second half of the novel is about Bastian's adventure. And an amazing adventure it is. As he journeys through Fantastica, his actions have consequences causing him to lose his identity, gradually turning him into one of the inhabitants of the kingdom, and threatening to remove his ability to ever get home.<br /><br />The beauty of the book is in the clarity of its characters, the effortless variety of fantastic settings and situations, and the way it taps into every reader's dream of being a part of the books they so love. Bastian's father, though a minor character, has a tremendous effect on Bastian's emotional journey. The world of Fantastica is one to fall in love with. The imagery, the flavour, the atmosphere, are all convincing and impressive.<br /><br />The Neverending Story is also overwhelmingly positive. If you want a story that ends with everybody dying horribly, you probably won't like this. If you like a story in which the main character receives irreparable emotional scars, then don't look here. But if you like a story in which people live and grow and are healed from their emotional scars, then this is the one.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I'm not a fantasy reader normally, but this is one of the few exceptions.<br /><br />Reviewed by the author of [[ASIN:B01FVBEZ3U Send Him Victorious]].ture it is.

B00AFEY354|5.0|What an enjoyable movie! I look forward to reading the book shortly.<br />Everyone knows the hardships of going through high school when you're the &#34;odd ball&#34; or, in Charlie's case, the wallflower. You're forever getting picked on and being talked about behind your back. In addition to taking criticism from others, Charlie also absorbs the impact of his close friends who are hurt emotionally, socially, physically. He wants to make the world of his friends better and doesn't take time out to heal himself. When his disturbed and distraught past starts edging its way back, Charlie finally gets to a point where he can bear the pain no longer and relapses into the hospital.<br />Through counseling, his friends and family's support, Charlie learns how to deal (and heal) with the pain and enjoy what life has to offer even though at times it may not be fair
B009LQKHIO|3.0|I guess it's safe to say that I have some mixed feelings about Finding Pride. I'll try to break it down.<br /><br />I think the characters were well-written. Oddly, though, I liked more of the secondary characters than I did the main characters. I wanted to learn more about Lacey and Iian than I did Megan and Todd. And there was something about Todd that just rubbed me the wrong way. Why was his family always telling him not to scare Megan? I felt like there was hints at something that had to do with him rather than Megan's past. Maybe I'm reading too much into things, but it bothered me.<br /><br />While the storyline was sweet, it was also predictable. Things felt rushed. I understand that when writing a book, an author wants to keep the story moving along at a decent pace while keeping the book a reasonable length. I also understand that when reading a book, a person might need to suspend reality and go with the flow. It's hard for me, though, to believe some of the things that happened in Finding Pride in the time span in which the book covers.<br /><br />I enjoyed the more simplistic writing style. I feel like it worked very well with the book. However, Finding Pride could have done with another once over from the author or a family member or friend. The grammatical errors and whatnot were a bit of a bother. I understand that things happen sometimes (and I have read books that are far worse!) and tried not to let it bother me too much. After reading a few comments on Amazon, it looks as those the author was able to edit the book and post an updated version on Smashwords. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the Kindle version has been updated yet.<br /><br />In general, I enjoyed Finding Pride. I would read the rest of the series.
B004184JZO|5.0|This is the first alien figure/model I ever owned. The reason I added the &#34;model&#34; is because it is smaller then the picture makes it look (I knew what the size would be I'm just giving a heads up) It's about 5 inches or so. The reason it's five stars is because I do love it and looks amazing. But that doesn't mean it's perfect. Some of the joints are &#34;sticky&#34; (most likely because it was in that position since it was packaged.) The alien is somewhat see-through, when you shine a light at it you can see the light but it's dim and looks &#34;murky&#34; inside. the egg is also somewhat see-through. And to the &#34;problems&#34; some of the Revoltech joints are loose a bit which isn't a big problem because it can hold the position fairly well. And the head comes off easily put putting it in is simple. The inner jaw could be longer too, but oh-well.<br /><br />Over all the figure is great but if you order it and open it, be careful of the joints. I would suggest carefully taking off the joints of the limbs and dip the ends in water and putting them back in to keep it loose. Only once or twice is good then once you start moving them they should be fine.

B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I really don't get the type of music he is experimenting here. I've been a good fan of his since his first two albums. Was able to track down his projects even before he became a household name today. A few partners from Detroit hit me up to him back in the late 90's, so that's going back a pretty good ways in listening to his productions. If like art imitates life and vice verse' I think Mr. West is a pretty good indication as such and this album is an example of it. I don't care for it. Sorry to the new, young, bang wagon Twitter fans who may disagree with this comment.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I cannot deny that Mrs. James is a good writer, very documented and with a sense of humor. However, I cannot believe that a plain, very young, virgin girl immediately accepts and passionately enjoys Mr.Grey´s peculiar sexual activities. Neither do I understand how a wealthy, successful and experimented man can fall so madly in love with such a girl.<br />The dialogs between the main characters repeat themselves, specially in the use of same sentences like ¨You´re biting your lip¨ and there is too much ¨ eye rolling¨ going on!.<br />The background suspense plot is simply childish, not to mention how Anastasia heroically rescues her sister in law.<br />In my opinion, it would have been better to restrict the novel to just one book.<br />The exchange of short sharp e mails I liked the most.

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I just loved this record, Bruno really outdid himself this time especially on the song Gorilla. I did'nt think he had it in him, I think all his female fans should have this record. He really is a great artist who is always overlooked and can sing all types of music and he is a really good live performer. Let me just be honest and say my favorite songs are Locked Out Of Heaven, Treasure, Gorilla, and Natalie. This album is really a beast, I would highly recommend this album to any body who appriaciates good music even if they are not a Bruno Mars fan.

B0067Q04AM|5.0|I had to let this project play a few times before I was hip, but now that I understand it...my God. Lemme say that I'm kinda hit or miss when it comes to my appetite for Glasper, and many say that he took a big reach outside of his realm with Black Radio. Well not only did he reach, but he laid a choke hold on some really good music with this project; not a single track is one to skip over because it ain't hot. Negative, they're all hot. The list of artists that have come together to make this project soar is about as sick as it gets. The vocals, the melodies, hooks, changes, grooves, bridges, intros & outros are all top-notch. This is just what the doc ordered for my music collection which needed that one project which comes along every 2 years or so that blows your mind and you need time to settle down from it...yeah, that one. MUSICIANS: If you like stank (that's right \\"stank\\") music from cats who are straight givin it up, this cd is for you. If you understand the sentiment in the sentence before this one, YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST GET THIS PROJECT...DON'T SLEEP. Way too many words to describe this project: Funky, jazzy, abstract, flowy, hypnotic, smooth, pretty, seductive, risky...but I don't wanna bore you. Just get this project is all I'm sayin, peace.

B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Having been called this many times myself I was really curious about what I would find. This character was me! The only difference was that I was born in the US. For once a novel that covers present day Nigeria without trying to become a historical treatise. after all peope read for entertainment. This book reminded me of my visits -long a few years to weeks over my life time. here is a woman who loses her identity finds it and grows up in the process, She goes for what you wants and takes risks. Of course there is a romance involved. The dreaded long distance relationship. (See if you can figure out which one) Plus a surprise ending that made me laugh out loud but I was okay with it.The only thing I might add is a glossary...If you have n't been to Nigeria expeecially Lagos you have not &#34;seen life&#34; from a &#34;Nija&#34; (J as in Jam) perspective trying to live in two worlds and still be yourself especially if you were born 'away' or are an Americanah/Britico

You have to read it to find out who...This book would be great for book clubs,history and literature classes for high school and up. I actally read Chiamanda's books becasue my daughtes were reading the Hibiscus in school.

B00B7Y0206|1.0|It says that it's free, but you can only watch videos if you pay. If you don't pay to have the advertisements removed, then they stay on the screen and cover up well over half of the video, making it virtually useless. If you're looking for a free Youtube app, then keep looking.

Comparisons have been made to The Name of the Wind and while I agree to some extent, this story is all its own. Constant action with plenty of emotion filled scenes and you find yourself unable to put this book down because you just have to know what is going to happen to Vaelin next! I highly recommend this book and honestly wish the second installment was out already!
B0051RU6KQ|5.0|I swear my husband and I know this entire movie forward and backwards because our kids love it so much!! The songs are good and it seems to never get old. I definately would recommend this movie for family trips in the car to play in a dvd player.

Just watched the third and it raises the bar a bit.  Nice to see some clever ingenuity instead of just a suit flying around.  Number 2 just doesn't have the intelligence that 1 and 3 have.  Entertaining... just not satisfying.
B00BJA2VFW|3.0|I feel like a turncoat towards the match three cause by criticizing a functional attractive game but my honest opinion is this game is mediocre at BEST.

B008Y7IP0S|5.0|I don't think that I've watched this since I was about 6 (yes, that's about when it came out).. Now that my kid is almost 6 I watched it again with him.  Still a great story.  Now that I'm um... older... I'm noticing the cinematic effects and understanding all of Mr. Miagi's lines, its even more enjoyable now.  The plot development is probably slow for today's kids, but still enjoyable. Sweep the leg!

B0011N1WE8|5.0|Its a little cheesy of course, because its meant to be fairytale like I think. The story is great, not as predictable as you would expect that kind of a movie to be, it has a beautiful message and very likeable characters. Christina Ricci does such a fantastic job as penelope, one of my all time favorite movies, it flows beautifully from begining to end. Even though it feels complete and whole when I reach the end of it im always left wanting more (its like an hour and half long i think), the first time I saw this movie i liked it so much and was so desperate for more that I watched it again from the begining. TWICE in one sitting! so beautiful! I watched it with my 12 year old god daughter recently and she loved it as much as I did!
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I'm not a gamer and don't play many games on my kindle, but this one has me hooked. Definitely worth the price and then some!
0061689246|3.0|First of all the idea behind this story is great, so unique and inventive. The land of Faery that exists beyond the wall is so interesting, you really want to throw yourself into that place. Secondly the writing is lovely. The writer does a great job of narrating. It was very pleasing to read the way he words things. It started off really well, I was very much enjoying it and then it kind of plateud. I would have liked more emotion? more drama? more description? Im not sure, just more I guess. I feel like the second half of the book is a little anti climatic wich is a shame because it had so much promise at the begining. Never the less, i did enjoy reading it although I have to say i very much preferred the movie version. I actually like having both of them in my life, there were some extra story in the book that wasnt in the movie due to time constraints im sure, and then the movie took the things that were a little downplayed in the book and made them feel more epic and exciting. Im glad I read it, although I cant say its the best story Ive ever read but like I said, the wording is lovely, and its a quick read, Im glad I picked it up.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I used this book to help me properly format mine.  Everything I needed was nicely laid out and made my task a whole like easier!
B0000549B0|5.0|One of the best movies Ive ever seen. I may be a little biased, I am in love with James Stewart and with old movies. Even so, of all the old movies Ive seen this one is by far on the top of my list. Truly heart warming, and uplifting. The MOST feel good movie ive ever seen, stewarts character is just a beautiful lovely human being. This movie is beautiful and funny! I watch it anytime Im upset and frustrated with the state of the world. Every person should watch it atleast once I think.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not a bad game but needs more levels. I flew through it in a day. I'll keep it for a bit to see how long it takes to make more levels. The ads aren't horrible and it didn't force close once.  If you like brain teaser type games then give it a whirl,  can be a bit confusing at first until you figure out what you need to do.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|SUCH a great story. Its so fun, the characters are so wonderful and alive. Its funny, sweet, uplifting and the visuals are so lovely. I recently read the book and the changes they made for the movie make it more dramatic, and give it a more...epic feel. Also some parts seemed to be cut so as to simplify and get to the point faster. I think they did a fantasitc job of making it a movie, there are one or two things the book has that the movie didnt that I missed, but the movie is superior to the book in other ways so its a good trade off. For example, Robert De Niro's character has a much more downplayed simple easily forgotten personality. His character in the movie is full of life and hillarious! And the ending of the book feels a little....anti climatic where as the movie makes the end grand and beautiful. A real &#34;happily ever after&#34; ending. I LOVE THIS MOVIE. One of my all time favorites! A little cheesy I suppose, but what fairytale isnt? Very happy, entertaining movie!
B007P6VLRS|4.0|Saw The Smashing Pumpkins on a Guitar Centers Session Special and liked the music they were playing. It's a more mature sounding Smashing Pumpkins.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Keep it coming  Sylvia. Just can't put it down.  I'm all, sighs, smiles and tingly in all the right places!
B0018OFN1S|3.0|I love action movies, especially ones with chase scenes, so this one definitely delivered in that aspect.  The writing, acting, and all the sorts of stuff that gets awards?  Who cares, it's not that kind of movie!  Attractive actors racing & chasing each other around in some awesome-looking vehicles.  It might not be great, but it's better than its sequels.
0545091063|5.0|I wasn't sure how I was going to like this book as I'm always a bit worried about YA books, but although the main character was a YA that is about where it stops being YA.  The book was well written and engaging and moved well from suspenseful to suspenseful moment.  The characters are liable if a bit transparent (they are teenagers after all) but the flow of the book is such that it's easy to get engrossed in the story.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book is beautifully written. I can feel Victoria's emotions from page one until the end. I cannot simply go on to the next book on my list. I must relive and digest each part of the story.lovely.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|Who can pull off a mix of genres like Bruno Mars.  I believe he is one of a kind and powerhouse of talent.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great version of spider solitaire. It runs well and has lots of options. The ads can be a little annoying but are quickly skipped so are not an issue. This game has provided hours of entertainment.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|J.T.  is an artistic and creative genius.  Excellent dance album, fun to listen to. WOW, this is a man in love.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a great game to play .You try to bet your high scrore with everyone on facebook.to see who is number one.
B0016MJ6HY|5.0|I thought it was a heartfelt movie and colorful. Norah Jones was excellent in her major acting debut.  I've recommended it to my friends.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This a game that you don't want to put down.You keep playing until you bet your high scrore.A game everyone will enjoy.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really dig this kind of stuff: sci-fi, epic battles, grand ending. The storyline is a little bit too straight forward, no twists, to the point where it's a little bit too naive, but nonetheless great book
B0000019PA|5.0|To start with - this album is perfect. It actually couldn't be any better, at all. Every song is fantastic, especially (in my opinion) Oh Comely, Communist's Daughter, and Two-Headed Boy. Really though, all of the songs on it would make my favourites list. The music is a mixture between uplifting and wistful, and the lyrics are beautifully written and thoughtful, if sometimes a bit cryptic. I don't think that's a bad thing, though.<br /><br />Delivery was fairly quick, but the one thing I'd say is that the packaging wasn't great - the plastic on the album cover was quite badly cracked on both sides. I love the album enough for it to not matter particularly, but it needed mentioning. Overall, great album and I'm thrilled with it.
B00COGXX7A|3.0|I read the book and liked it a lot, but the movie was a lot different. I didn't care for the differences Hollywood gave us in the movie version, but I realize it's hard to fit all that book into an hour and a half. I thought it was cute, but the casting seemed a little off to me, and it was so predictable.
B0052W9PJI|4.0|A very nice german steelbook of the fantastic film Pearl Harbour, nice done looks nice in my steelbook collection, great movie
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is an enjoyable and challenging game. can you escape makes me think each time i enter a new level. good game.

B00CF34B2I|5.0|so awesome.  Lot's of fun for people who love the series.  probably the most complete series yet. the new sealed deck option is a lot of fun
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids both love these games. Thanks for giving them hours of entertainment. We appreciate it most at restaurants.<br />Thank you
B000001ESN|4.0|You know what this is before you buy it - a couple of absolute Rush all-time favorite hits buried in with some filler material.<br /><br />And it is what it is.  The hits belong in any Rush fan's collection - they are \\"must-haves.\\"<br /><br />But maybe grabbing them on a greatest hits CD might make more sense unless you are such a fan that you have to have the dirt as well as the diamonds.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When u ARE about to get this app u just get sooo anxious and then the next day u get it u open it up after u buy it, and YOU ARE IN A WHOLE NEW WORLD OF MINECRAFT!!!p.s. BUY IT!!!
B007I2BZIE|3.0|Saw the show.  Loved it!<br />Got the T-Shirt. Love it!<br />Got the CD.<br /><br />Meh. Somehow the show didn't translate to the disk.  After a couple of listens - still \\"Meh.\\"<br />Lukewarm. No hum-alongs, no anthems, no \\"hit,\\" no ear-worms to be found.<br /><br />Kinda like getting into the coolest car in the world but the engine won't start.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So far it is a great and exciting read. I haven't finished it yet. I'm trying to mske it last but I want to try to get threw it to see if the auther is gunna do another one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a great mind puzzle game!  I thouroughly enjoyed it and cannot wait for more -to see if I can escape those rooms!  What fun!
0307476073|4.0|If you enjoy travel essays, this is a good read.  Strayed writes in an eBay, flowing style that carries you along the Pacific Coast Trail and shares insights into her personal life.
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|Have been a fan of Amon Amarth for a decade now. How is it possible that each successive album is better than the previous album. Most bands seem to reach a point in their career then they start to either decline gradually or plummet in free fall. But not Amon Amarth. This is what metal should sound like. Could this possibly be death metal album of the year. Well, it has my vote.
0978545095|5.0|This book is wonderful!  The narrative before each chapter explains a lot if the photos hat you are about to see, plus gives you insight into her very reclusive life.  An amazing photographer!
B002ZG9968|1.0|Did not receive on the 25th.  was going out of town, purchased movie for our trip, We were leaving on the 26th!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game, you can get creative and make your specialized village!<br />i<br />I hope gameloft keeps making new games and improving already existing ones.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|Everytime Ive tried to use it there has been a problem with it.  Total waste of my time.  Don't  bother.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I love Kanye West but this album is terrible. Hate it. I don't get the critics about this album. I was excited to buy it but I ended up putting it in the garbage. Kanye wake up!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|like it. easy to use. recommend it for anyone. Go ahead, try it you will like it!!! really you will
B004QBWU02|5.0|I wanted to go back to a simpler time when life was so much easier. It’s got to be one of my favorite movies
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A great continuation to the series...left me anticipating what will come next. Would definately recommend, but re-read the first two books first.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I have read everything by Neil Gaiman (i think - he writes A LOT)<br /><br />American Gods is a creative story, told very well.<br /><br />This version is fine on the kindle.<br /><br />It is an adult book but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to teenager either.
B00003CXCD|5.0|fond memories of watching with my mom and dad.  My daughter had her wedding with the colors of Breakfast with Tiffany's so she and I watch it when feeling down about my parents her grandparents being gone.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Yes, this is HBO's hot show, and this dvd will show you why. The locations, the costuming, the characters, the acting and the writing, is the best on television today.<br /><br />One of the best things about the dvd are the featured actors commentary on each episode. Very entertaining to see what was going on while certain scenes were being filmed. And being blu ray, the glorious detail on the costuming is astounding.<br /><br />The ninth episode &#34;Blackwater&#34; is my favorite of the bunch. It's focused tight on the battle about to happen at King's Landing, and Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey absolutely shine in this episode. Honestly, Dinklage should have won an Emmy for it.
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Just received this knife in the mail. After opening the package and reviewing the knife for maybe 5 minutes or so, I was quite pleased with what I had received. The blade was thick, the blade was sharp, and the over all weight was a little more than expected, but I liked it. I think a heavy blade means reliability. After further inspection, I had realized that the edge on the blade was already starting to chip, and even split in an area toward the handle. Although the craftsmanship on the knife wasn't what I had hoped, I quickly realized that I only paid 40$ for the thing, and I started to feel better. Its a good blade, something that I hope to test out when camping or such, and not worry about beating up too much or breaking because it didnt cost me an arm and a leg. So in conclusion, I would consider this a win, and just use the knife for what its good for... beating the hell out of it.
B002RXMG00|5.0|The family started watching Bates Motel the TV series and the 16 year likes it so we said this was required viewing. Over the years you see the shower scene so many times you forget about all the other parts of the story. This is an important movie.
B0071MQ37E|5.0|an outstanding production - loved the two leads - especially Sierra Boggess- I believe this is at the top of the many times I have seen this show.
B002B554TO|5.0|I finally hooked up my turntable to our surround sound system, and this is a new album to add to my 1000+ collection. This review is for the VINYL version, not the mp3 or cd.<br />I'm so pleased and surprised at how GREAT this album sounds. It is perfectly mixed for this audio setup, which other new vinyl albums aren't. It's outstanding quality.<br />I love it - you can read detailed reviews on the songs them selves in other reviews. Florence and the Machine are one of the few new groups who make real music, with emotion. And her voice...oh that beautiful big voice...
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This DVD went behind the scenes and showed some very important aspects in the production of our food. I pray that this DVD get into every household and every community so the consumer will be able to make an educated decision as it regards to the purchase of their food. Taking note that this could be the purchase that could either help you in maintaining your family members healthy life and lifestyle or the plain truth, take them, the ones you love to the grave.
B007REV4YI|5.0|We enjoyed this movie so much, we bought the blu ray. We think Daniel Craig is great as Bond, and this one is action packed with all the big Bond scenes we've come to expect and love. The blu ray on our hi def tv and surround sound is as awesome as being in theater.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Gladwell's Outliers speaks to a great divide that exists in our culture, in that we can all be successful if we take the given examples Gladwell lays out in this book. Only we've become so occupied in that only certain individuals are gifted, that we fail to see greatness in each person.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Very entertaining film from Ben Affleck. We bought the blu ray because when we realized we wanted to see this movie, it was as cheap to by the blu ray as it was for us to go to the movies. Plus we could have cocktails while viewing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game I have to say is even better than temple run two because it has more obstacles that are challenging but also fun at the same time. I totally recommend it to anyone who loves temple run.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Run down the railroad tracks for the coins while dodging and hopping atop speeding trains. A fun and very active game. Keeps you hopping. Collect coins and other prizes before the station guard nabs you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This a light game of subway surfers also i like the daily hunt challenge because you get cool free stuff.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|Loved the movie. Excellent acting, great story, excellent message.<br />I am sure not everybody would like it though. The story (interconnecting stories) is complicated and you really have to pay attention.<br />If you only watch superhero movies, this one is probably not for you...
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game was really fun and easy to play. Excellent for all ages. Easy to level up and to understand.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love these books! Gideon and Eva's story is so exciting and erotic. I am anxiously awaiting the next book!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is rlly good. It provides a variety of challenges to complete everyday.But I don't particularly like how they automatically change the setting of where the game takes place..
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the fourth time I have read the series and it gets better every time. Steig's writing is absolutely amazing.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and can't wait for the next one to come out.  I had a hard time putting it down once I started it.
B00BSWMITK|3.0|The album is very versatile as most of his albums are, but some of the musicians overplay and make it hard to hear what Joe is really trying to achieve. Vinnie Colaiuta is definitely not suited for this album, he's more of an improv, in a world of his own type drummer. I prefer Campetelli as usual, just straight forward solid drumming, and let Joe do his magic. There is just to much going on to really enjoy it, lots of rolls, cymbal work, keyboards, fake horns etc. Three Sheets To The Wind being a good example, that mainly sounds like a song from the big top circus. The title track is a high light along with, Can't Go Back, Jumpin' In, Shine On American Dreamer (which sounds more old school), and A Celebration. So the album is good, but as I said the other instruments shove Joe into the background and this is his album, it's not Dream Theater. I'm more interested in his guitar than what everyone else plays. Probably why Flying In A Blue Dream was/is one of my favorite album. He played almost every instrument on that album, sang, and used a drum machine for 70% of it.<br /><br />So while Joe never fails, this album is well, just sub par, mainly because of what i mentioned. His solos are good, the song structures are \\"ok\\" but some songs do sound recycled. I was hoping for more catchy choruses, more distortion, and wild hammer ons, and pull offs. Well that's not to be found here much. Just on a few songs. If every song sounded like \\"Searching\\" I would even be happy. Make every song a giant jam session. So I think a 3 is very fair, i can't ever dog Joe because he's the master of solo guitar artists, but he can definitely do better. Which I say with a grain of salt.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I had only read a very few of the Sherlock Holmes stories before I bought this set.  There are several things that aggravate me about it but it has much more to do with the dated style of writing than any other thing.  The table of contents is nice and as a collection it can't be beat.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun for the kids and I love the way that it takes u all around the world it is relly awesome and u should tottaly get the kids the game its free and addicting
0761158820|5.0|Extremely happy with this purchase, and very much appreciate the creativity and artistry that went into designing each monster. So many clever, cute designs to choose from. As parents, we've been having fun assembling the monsters for our little one, who has spent hours exercising imaginative play with them. We built a house with dividers/rooms out a cardboard box to further enhance the play. Very well-designed book, and die-cuts are precise and generally easy to follow (the advanced ones can get tricky, though). We've used Aleene's quick dry tacky glue to adhere the paper, which has worked out well for us, as it takes about 5-10 seconds for the paper to adhere and become un-repositionable. Love the blank \\"design-your-own\\" monsters at the end. Very impressed and highly recommended! For the number of monsters you end up with, and the play value, it's a great value!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the most amazing GAME ever to exist it is totally worth the seven dollars you have buy it if you like minecraft
B00B4804KS|5.0|This is the best 3D work I have seen.  All the little details are highlighted.  All the leaves in the trees, cups on tables, they all pop off the screen!  A must have for a 3D library.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is ge best game ever! it only has 10 levels but its really fun! it has you figure out how to escape rooms by using your thinking cap! I recommend it to children 8 and up! its a little bit tricky for younger kids! Get it!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a very realistic game that has a lot of ways that horses need to be taken care of.  it is a lot of fun to play.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I just wish that it didn't take so long for energy or krystals. The game will keep you kn your toes
159463176X|5.0|There are few books which just transport the reader & turns the reader into an integral part of the story itself. Khaled Hosseini's \\"And the Mountains Echoed\\" is one such book. As I was reading through the book, I could not help but get a feeling as if the events were unfolding right in front of my eyes. The amazingly vivid picture that Khaled paints of Afghanistan makes me wonder what a beautiful country it must have been before it feel victim to those greedy humans. I could not help but send out a silent prayer for the well-being of the people of this country & hope that one day this country gets restored back to its glorious past.<br /><br />Just like his previous two novels Kite Runner & Thousand splendid sons, Khaled has written an emotional story which stings the heart, brings a tear to the eye. The story revolves around one family with the central characters being the brother & sister in the family, how they get separated & then how fate brings them back together. He has divided the books into chapters, with each chapter being narrated by an individual character of the story. It's amazing how Khaled keeps you focused on the central theme of the book which is this family while also highlighting the issues & problems faced by the people in Afghanistan.<br /><br />As I came to the end of the book, I almost did not want the story to end. That is how fascinating this journey was for me. The only other book where I had experienced a similar feeling was \\"The Glass Palace\\" by Amitav Ghosh. Generally when authors write their next novels, they find it hard to match the popularity or the intensity of their previous bestsellers but Khaled's writing just keeps getting better. I cannot wait for his next novel now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a cool interesting game with lots of activeites,  like you can feed your horse / horses, compete,  groom,  clean its stall and lots and lots more,  so you should get this game :)
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|I love this game its one of the best games ever!!!!!!! if I were u I would totally get this app and the best part is that its free
B002FQOI0A|4.0|I thought this book was very powerful. A very nice story. I think all girls should read it. I would recommend it.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|It was similar to the Mission Impossible movies but not as intense.  Liked the movie since it took on a political aspect
034580404X|3.0|I didn`t like some of the grafic discriptions,but on the whole it was a good? story. In my estimation only suitable for adults not easily shocked.
B004P8A7J2|2.0|Movie was ok..  I found it to be a depressing movie and not really entertaining but did finish watching the movie.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I was skeptical, but I have seen the light... the light of my Kindle as this program allowed me to watch videos that were once unsupported. Thank you Mobo Team.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I have enjoyed knowing Temperance Brennan for the past few years.  I delighted to find she has a different private life in the book and I would like to read more about this Temperance by Kathy Heichs.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game, but I cannot connect it to FB anymore to compete with my friends. Help, what do I do? It is so much fun.
B00B4804KS|5.0|We had neighbors over to watch this ol' movie in 3-D on our new TV and everyone had a great time.  Being scared again after a few years was great fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how this game turned out! I love competing, and the graphics are absolutely breath-taking! I definately recommend this game for any horse-lover.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this series.  Great love story.  I look forward to another.  I do wish this could have wrapped up the series.
0385349831|3.0|Good, but not quite what I was looking for...and maybe not quite as good as his other books. I had a pre-production copy, so some of the small errors may have influenced me a bit. Not sure. I just didn't get thrilled.It seemed more like an OK novel than a real exposition of truth.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This was an exciting season.  My wife and I loved it.  though it seems they played up a few dramatic parts a little bit.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|if you always wanted a real horse this is your game just for you you take care of it and people help you.
B003CI90MQ|3.0|But even if you are a little more advanced (as I am) there is still information that you might find helpful. Scott Kelby is great in postproduction, Photoshop is present almost at all times throughout this book, he also advocates for a lot of shooting in A,P,and S modes (As in Nikon but same is valid for Canon shooters) , in the end it comes down to what kind of shooter are you, if one that strives to get the shot right in camera with minimal post CORRECTING, or a shooter who likes post PROCESSING to get creative with the RAW info from you camera. Get it, for $9 (Kindle Version) you can't go wrong. Would I get #2,3 &4? I don't think so; if you are planning on getting them all then it is a better deal to look for and get the bundle edition to save a couple of bucks.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a great app for the kindle hd which seems to have a very short battery life, I now check the battery every day and put it to charge when it shows it getting below 50%.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I missed watching the first two seasons and asked for DVDs for those for Christmas.  I wanted to watch the third season before they start up again for season four, so I bought series three for myself.  I'm almost done with season three right now and can't wait to finish it!  Every single episode has been entertaining! Amazing show and actors!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I must admit I have only used this once but it is easy to use and very bright I'm sure it will get used again
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Haunting and heart achingly beautiful. A young girl coming of age in Hitler's Germany. The narrator is death, but death has a conscious and is a keen observer of the human condition.  Death has singled out this girl's story to tell.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|The film is exactly as advertised...fun, mindless and violent. It won't ever win any awards, but you won't fall asleep either!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Silvia Day impressed me again. Silvia leaves me wanting more. So excited for the last two books..Wishing I knew how Gideon and Eves story ends but it will be bitter sweet. The Crossfire series has been beyond exciting and full twists and turns. AAA++++
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I need help!<br />It is frustrating.<br />There must be some tricks to doing this. Is there a how too book?
0451232852|2.0|I liked this book much better than \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" even though the history and politics were exceedingly boring and tedious.  I am at page 750 and realize that never has Follett ONCE mentioned the Germans use of poison gas in WW I.  Why?  The gas is a salient characteristic of that war!  They began using tear gas in 1913 and progressed up to the horrible chlorine gas in 1917.  Surely Follett and his staff did not miss this in all their research?!!!  He could have used a lot of paragraphs for this horrible weapon and saved us many BORING paragraphs of why the war started, Bolshevism, etc.  I'm sorry I bought the blasted book.  No more Ken Follett.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game really is very fun and extremely balanced with the mix of magic and physical combat. I recommend this game for anyone who likes game's with magic.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is pretty fun. I like it. I like to fly above the buses! I would like more levels. Great game!
0345529057|5.0|Picked this set up for my nephew. Great value and nice nice box set. He could not have been happier.
B00BSWMITK|3.0|I haven't had time to listen to it that closely.  Joe either grabs me right away or i have to give it several listens.  I hope its one of them that i just need to get there.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Wow.. This ladies and gentlemen is an awesome story! I could not put it down. I loved how this is written and told from a man's point of view. You won't be disappointed. :o)
B00A8307BG|5.0|Trower has kept his fantastic sound going for how many years,  I will always be a devoted fan.  This won't disappoint.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Outliers sets out to dispel the myth that great success is achieved through individual talent.  It argues that success is achieved through hard work, culture, and a lot of luck.<br /><br />Even though the book is pretty short (336 pages), Malcolm Gladwell does a great job outlining his argument and citing the latest research.  The book is an easy read, but provides great insight.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Not up to my expectations.... lacking the beauty of the language of his first 2 books which I enjoyed so much.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|We watch this movie repeatedly and love it every time. I bought it to show my grandchildren although we have seen it many times.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Cool story, great make up, and locations. Tom Hanks is awesome as always. Would watch it again.  It's called Karma
0345535421|5.0|Doesn't lag like many sequels, can't wait to start the next one!  Definitely another great book by a wonderful author.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is probably my favorite book series next to Harry Potter. It's beautifully written. This book made me cry and laugh and feel the love. An amazing book, I recommend it to everyone!!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|this part is just what we ordered and needed would recommend and will be purchasing more of them for our business
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It was kind if a tough read not only because of the way it's written (as told by a five year old), but also because of the strong themes. It's a sad story of a woman and her son locked in a room by a bad man, and their daily lives and their quests. Definitely recommend, but be prepared to shed some tears or sniffles.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The problem with finishing this one is there is a wait for the next one. Not only was it another enjoyable work of fiction by Follett, it was a great piece of history education on the 20th century and rise of Facism
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is probably my favorite book series next to Harry Potter. It's beautifully written. This book made me cry and laugh and feel the love. An amazing book, I recommend it to everyone!!
0345529057|5.0|I am extremely satisfied with this product.  The item was delivered to my house in four days and I was amazed how wonderful the condition was.  I can't put the books down!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is probably my favorite book series next to Harry Potter. It's beautifully written. This book made me cry and laugh and feel the love. To me, it had a great ending and was entertaining the entire way though. An amazing book, I recommend it to everyone!!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was wonderful and i got to use it as a pass time. I really love this story and the events in it. Every one should read this book! People of all ages would love reading about Dorothy`s adventures.

0307476073|5.0|As my title says, I would have given this book 10 stars if I could. I usually prefer fiction and when I read the back cover of Strayed's novel, it didn't sound like something I'd be interested in; however, once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. It really was addicting. I kept wanting to know what would happen to Cheryl on her journey. This novel was truly inspiring, and I'm surprise it doesn't have a five star rating.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Very good shows. The characters are very thorough with each case.  Shows are well written.  They hold your interest to the end.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey's humor was portrayed excellently in this novel. I really enjoyed reading it. Even if you aren't a business person, you'll enjoy this book. It was a great book to read before bed, because I didn't have to think, too hard, and I found myself laughing out loud a lot. I would recommend this book for sure!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very touching and relevant to all cancer survivors. I would recommend this book to anyone who has been affected by cancer.
B008M0TMXQ|5.0|Love'm! Specially this summer... it's been raining and at the cottage, they are the only shoes that can survive water. You just wash'em and wear them!
B0026NWBY2|3.0|Although a nice summary of George's music, it is disappointing that the live tracks are lifted from the Concert for Bengladesh . Replacing those tracks  with some other songs would have improved the CD.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This case fits the Kindle perfectly, has plenty of room for cords to be used and I like that it is very simple to open and fold it into the desired configuration.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Keeps you wanting for more! Keep reading it only gets better!  The story is interesting an  make  you think\\"what if\\"?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love to follow the &#34;good&#34; guys and the not so nice ones.  The characters develop nicely over time, some changing for the good.  My only complaint if the choice of  Elizabeth McGovern as the Mother.  She's a terrible actress.  She seems to think she looks coy, when talking to others, by never looking at them straight on.  The head is either tilted down and she looks up through her lashes or she looks sideways at them.  Her voice inflections are not convincing either.  The other actors do a wonderful job.  We're starting season 3 tonight.  Can't wait.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|This can be fun if you have the patience.  I have ended many a race after accidentally tapping a pedal.  I've had no glitches and no problems.
B008602KQI|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE, WHICH KEEPS YOU GUESSING AND WISHING FOR A GREAT OUTCOME.  THE ACTORS DID AND EXCELLENT JOB IN THIS MOVIE.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved the rich characters in this novel but found myself wondering why some of them were so prominently featured. The story rambled across decades and continents and throughout brought me to tears. Who is this novel about? Pari. Nabi, Abdullah? The echo of all three.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a GREAT book.  I was excited to learn that Hosseini had written another book.  I could hardly put it down.  Hosseini is a fabulous author.  I recommend all three of his books to date.
0061733199|5.0|This book has a very surprisingly large amount of info! And not just a bunch of nonsense either. There is valuable knowledge on every single page, with great detailed pics for reference. This is a book you will own for the rest of your life.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I love Sylvia Day's books and have read many. I was soooo looking forward to the third installment in th Crossfire series and was excited to finally get to read it. However when I came to the end, it felt as though I should have had more chapters to come. It's one thing to have a suspenseful ending, but this was like, &#34;what? It's over?&#34;.<br /><br />A lot of time had been spent on filling-in on the past two books and not enough time on Eva and Gideon's current and future relationship. It was a book for &#34;new to Crossfire readers&#34;; wait for the next book.<br /><br />I feel cheated. It certainly wasn't worth the price.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My granddaughter wanted this movie and Disney still had it in the Vault.  Right after I purchased it, Disney announced that they were going to re-release it...Hah! The laugh is on Disney!!  I purchased it brand new for about 1/2 the price! Thank you, Amazon.com! :) Everyone is happy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game really is fun. it is kind of frustrating because sometimes it's hard to figure things out. but it really is fun.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I'm a boomer that grew up with the Beatles, Stones, Who, etc. Muse brings a new blend of hard rock, symphonic, electronic and haunting music/lyrics that appeals to my old roots as well as new tastes in modern rock. Saw them live in Montreal and they're a band that demands review.

B005EWDA3I|5.0|My 17 year old son put me onto Murakami and usually as a teacher, I am a little skeptical of a lot of literature that teenagers love, but this guy is amazing.  His writing style is brilliant - such an expressive command and his use of the language borders on the poetic.<br /><br />But the best part is the plot line.  Interwoven and intricate, it comes together like the most amazing jig-saw puzzle, but never leaves you behind.  Every piece as it fits makes you go, &#34;Wow.&#34;  I couldn't put it down.  It left me stunned with its inventive, almost sci-fi like and very provocative premise all the way to the end.  A must read.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|Certainly some interesting inside information, but so immoral, so degenerate. (Spoiler alert.) 80% through the book, the author finally discusses another chef who runs an excellent operation in a sane, ethical, moral manner, and admits that this case makes the rest of what he says untrue!  For a great kitchen read, I recommend &#34;Blood, Bones and Butter&#34; by Gabrielle Hamilton.  Gabrielle also has her Psychiatric and Drug issues, but she struggles to be a decent person - and wins.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|An amazing show, from the first second I began to watch I was glued to it... I'm looking forward to watching more seasons of this great show!
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|I love this movie!! It was so funny & love the horror.<br />Horror movie fans if you're looking for a funny horror movie this is the movie for you!!
B009KUWWW0|3.0|This book is not as good as the 'Pillars' book but is very readable and somewhat entertaining.  As others have pointed out, the book is filled with gratuitous sex.  The book is quite predictable.  On another note, I bought the Deluxe Kindle Edition which is marketed as having additional video content.  The video content is merely the trailer for the mini series that was named after this book and a video on the making of the mini series.  I say 'named after' because the plot and storylines of the mini series are much different than the book.  So, if you have already seen the mini-series, you really have no idea what the book is about.
B000PMG16U|3.0|1. Not much to say about the movies that people don't already know. If Lucas tried as hard with the dialogue and acting as much as he did with the special effects (the only thing he put focused effort on), they would be spectacular. They are what they are at this point. 2 stars<br /><br />2. This Blu-Ray version is amazing in terms of picture and sound but in terms of special features: NOTHING. Unless you get the entire 6 movie collection do you get the extras. I already have the special edition original trilogy (with that hack actor Hayden Christiansen as Anakin at the end of Jedi)on DVD and Lucas, despite the overwhelming negative response to his tinkering, still tinkered more with the Blu-Ray versions. Why would I want that? 3 stars<br /><br />3. I received this shipment very fast and in good condition. 5 stars for seller
B006N0YWGY|1.0|hats this game it. does the same thing over and over and over. this game is boring and immpodsible to win.
1250000971|5.0|This is one of Jeffrey Archer's best.  I loved this more than Rich Man/ Poor Man.  Once you start the saga you cant wait for the next in the series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so cool !! It gave me 60 gems 4 free after u have it for a while ! There is also a lot to do : take care of horse . Buy horses . Go to shows . Train ur horses .do quests.. and more ... oh ,, oh I almost forgot visit neighbors and gift them !! :) awesome game y'all !

B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was very fun and addicting. Can't wait for more levels. My 8 year old really liked it too.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very good!  Interesting read, easy to read.  Wish he would've went more into what spiritual experiences he had tho.  Do recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun, challenging, but not impossible. I've played similar games, but this is my favorite by far. Nice graphics, and it doesn't have that &quot;creepy&quot; vibe that a lot of room escape games do. The only negative is that there are only 10 levels so far, and I beat them relatively quickly. Still, I'd like to replay the levels. Great game.
B00D3LA71K|5.0|Just sat through the best (so far) movie of 2013--and I have one word to describe this experience--WOW!!!<br /><br />Perfect casting, flawless direction, impeccable acting, and a mesmerizing, poignant, and genuinely believable screenplay by director Jeff Nichols.<br /><br />As a fellow Arkansan, I can honestly say Mr. Nichols captured the lazy summer, river driven, flavor of the state.<br /><br />McConaughey has never been better, and the two boys are equally excellent. It even has the great Sam Shepard as the \\"father\\" of the title character Mud. I just hope the film doesn't get overlooked at Oscar time, since it was released so early in the year. It deserves many nominations, including Best Picture.<br /><br />By the way, Mr. Nichols, the final shot was pure perfection.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is really fun, even if you don't like golf. The solitary game is Tri-peaks so if you like that game you will like this game. The gopher is cute and funny. You get a lot of game play for your money.  It's like all big fish games you get to try the game for 6 games then you have the option to buy the game. I've been playing this game non stop for 5 hrs. and I'm still not done. I'm really enjoying this game and I think you will to.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I confess, I had not really heard much about this book until recently.  As Hollywood prepares to bring forth its version of this story, the book is getting more notice.  I enjoyed the story and found it quite thought provoking.  This book will take you for a great ride with its engaging story, while challenging readers to examine human nature and the issues of power (both political and military) and morality.<br /><br />I highly recommend this read.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Man of Steel is an A+ quality movie. From start to finish is an engrossing movie experience that has a wonderful balance of story and action. Christopher Nolan's hand in this movie is very evident. Like Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy Man of Steel is a dark and serious movie start to finish. The movie is driven by story and action and there are very few comedic moments in this movie. And thankfully there's very little romance in this movie. Like Batman Begins and the 2009 Star Trek Man of Steel ignores prior movies in the series and is portrayed as a beginning story. The tension between Jor-el and Zod and Later Superman and Zod is palpable. The acting in this film was wonderful and the characters well performed and convincing. Then there's the story itself. The struggle for self identity story Clark Kent goes through once on earth is very human and very well written. The human element is much more present in this film than in Superman Returns. The more notable presence of the human element and a much better story make this film soar above Superman Returns. Nolan's plot has brought some of the brilliance the Dark Knight trilogy gave the Batman series and brought it to the Superman series. And Zack Snyder's directing gave us a wonderful action movie. The action in this movie is flat out awesome and far superior to the action in Superman Returns. The special effects and visuals are right on. Intense and realistic but not overdone. Man of Steel's wonderful balance of story and action and lack of romance make it an extremely satisfying movie. Both Superman fans and general audiences should love Man of Steel. This is everything you'd want in a great summer blockbuster. Great movie. 5 out of 5 stars easily. :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Such a good book.  I couldn't put it down, I had to know what was going to happen next.  I was truly surprised at many places in the book, I didn't see some of the twists and turns coming.  I would like to read more.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|well written, interesting story lines, captivating characters, I highly recommend it and I can not wait for the sequels to the story.
0399255370|5.0|I've loved crayons since I was a kid, so I think I was destined to fall in love with The Day the Crayons Quit.  Any small child with a fondness for coloring will be entranced by these crayon characters and their complaints.  Who would have thought that the red crayon might be feeling a bit overworked, what with all those fire engines, valentines, and Santa Claus!  And what about gray?  When you like elephants, like Duncan does, that gray crayon gets a work out!  Orange and yellow aren't speaking to each other since they both think they should be the color of the sun, and pink is MAD because it never gets used.  It's not just a crayon for girls!  Perhaps my favorite is the peach crayon, who is left hiding in the box because his paper wrapping has been peeled off.  He's naked and too embarrassed to leave the box.<br /><br />Each spread features a letter to Duncan from his crayon, along with assorted crayon drawings.  The writing is stellar, exhibiting a level of wit, intelligence, whimsy and energy that mark a truly fine picture book for this age group.  Jeffers' crayon drawings strike just the perfect note of childlike creativity to accompany this expertly written book.  Jeffers manages to convey quite a bit of personality to each crayon color with just a few well-placed lines and simply drawn faces. All ends well as Duncan discovers the perfect way to keep all of his crayons happy!<br /><br />I simply love this ode to coloring and hope that it encourages a few youngsters to put down the computer mouse and open up their own box of crayons.  Any kid who takes the time to ponder what their own crayons might be thinking will take one look at these pictures and decide that they can do this too!  Just stand back and watch the creativity start to flow.  Maybe we will finally settle the argument between orange and yellow.  What is the correct color of the sun?  It might just be green in your crayon box.  While this is a bit long for preschool story time, I wouldn't hesitate to read it aloud to older children.  It's also a must have for any parent wishing to remind their child of the fun to be had in a box of crayolas.to read it aloud to older children.  It's also a must have for any parent wishing to remind their child of the fun to be had in a box of crayolas.

B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Google is good.  I  Like  it  because you can access a lot of things.  Most anything you want to find you can.
B0070ZLZ1G|1.0|Another set of posers trying to make a living off the experiences of low income and minority students.  They go to their high priced schools and graduate from Ivy League institutions.  After observing a few students they know all about their lives and can now make money off the experiences of others.  Bogus, but normal behavior from the posers.
B00B671W6W|1.0|I love Anthrax, but this EP is god-awful.  There's nothing special about these covers at all, and the songs they chose just plain suck.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This \\"Crossfire series\\" just gets better and better!  I can't wait for the next book.....Hope it won't be too long before it comes out!  If you liked Fifty Shades of Grey THEN you will love this series.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Except for the lightest of sleepers, Kindle Fire HD 7&quot; volume is so low I barely hear the alarm when I am awake.
B006O2QNOU|4.0|Well acted, great script. People who know big business and the stock market will like this. It was over my head,  but the basic plot line was interesting.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is sooo fun I cant wait for the other levels! I love his game sooo much I play this on my tablet
B0097EWK3A|5.0|i fricken love it!!!! the set up is great just wish i had the three dollars to continue :/ itd be well worth it though
B008Y5OX8I|5.0|I love Papa Roach.. I bought the cd The Connection as soon as it came out.  Saw it was on vinyl and had to get it., My husband who is not a big roach fan seemed to enjoy it too
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|I am not a big fan of Rod Stewart. I never have been. Let's just forget the past decade of Stewart's career. Let's forget how he sold his soul to Clive Davis for a buck. Let's back up to before his failed attempt at contemporary rhythm & blues in 2001's \\"Human\\". Let's go all the way back to 1998. Before his health scare. Before the dissolution of his third marriage. Before everything started going south. That's where \\"Time\\" belongs. Now, I understands hardcore fans giving \\"Time\\" five stars, because, well, when you've completely gone off the rails for over a decade, \\"Time\\" can sound like the greatest Rod Stewart album ever--kind of like days without water and then your first taste of cool elixir makes you feel insatiable.<br /><br />As I said before, I am not a big Rod Stewart fan. So, I am not fooled here. Three stars. \\"Time\\" is not as good as some of his better works, nor is it his worst. It is a return to form, and a welcomed one at that. No more lounge act. No more covering rock standards or soul standards. This is real time with Rod Stewart.<br /><br />The trouble with Rod Stewart is he is a singer. I have never felt him to be a musician or great lyricist. He's just a good singer. I'd debate whether he's a great singer. His vocals are distinct, and you know it's him. However, like Tina Turner, he's only as good as his band and material, and this is evidenced by the wild inconsistencies in his albums over his career. With \\"Time\\" Stewart goes back to co-writing credits, and this is hit or miss. I realize he is 68, has numerous children, has been married and divorced multiple times, and so this is what he knows, what he writes about on \\"Time\\". It's just that it comes across sappy. You know, Johnny Cash in his late career with hoarse voice was still dancing circles around Stewart on \\"Time\\".<br /><br />Still, there is a little life-blood here on \\"She Makes Me Happy\\", \\"Can't Stop Me Now\\", \\"Beautiful Morning\\", \\"Finest Woman\\" and, and, well that's about it for the rockers here. Everything else is mid-tempo or balladry, and it's hit or miss, as I said before. His cover of Tom Waits' \\"Picture In A Frame\\" is okay. \\"Pure Love\\" sounds like one of the most heartfelt songs Stewart has ever done in his entire career. Interestingly, two bonus tracks stand out as pretty good--his cover of \\"Corrina Corrina\\" and another rocker \\"Legless\\".<br /><br />So what we have here is Rod Stewart getting his mojo back. Rod Stewart going back to his 90's self. There's nothing surprising here, no reinventing the wheel, nothing daringly different, just Rod documenting his current affairs. Pleasant. I'd still take Springsteen or Mellencamp or Buckingham or Simon or even McCartney over Stewart, but \\"Time\\" goes a long way in restoring my interest. As always, before reviewing the new album, I go back and listen to all the old albums in sequential order to get a current feel for the new work, and here is how \\"Time\\" compares with Stewart's back catalog:<br /><br />1969 The Rod Stewart Album/An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down: Four Stars<br />1970 Gasoline Alley: Five Stars<br />1971 Every Picture Tells A Story: Five Stars<br />1972 Never A Dull Moment: Five Stars<br />1974 Smiler: Three Stars<br />1975 Atlantic Crossing: Three and a Half Stars<br />1976 A Night On The Town: Five Stars<br />1977 Foot Loose & Fancy Free: Two and a Half Stars<br />1978 Blondes Have More Fun: Three Stars<br />1980 Foolish Behaviour: Three and a Half Stars<br />1981 Tonight I'm Yours: Three and a Half Stars<br />1983 Body Wishes: Two and a Half Stars<br />1984 Camouflage: Three and a Half Stars<br />1986 Every Beat Of My Heart/Rod Stewart: One Star<br />1988 Out Of Order: Three and a Half Stars<br />1991 Vagabond Heart: Three and a Half Stars<br />1995 A Spanner In The Works: Three Stars<br />1998 When We Were The New Boys: Three Stars<br />2001 Human: Two Stars<br />2002 It Had To Be You: One Star<br />2003 As Time Goes By: One Star<br />2004 Stardust: One Star<br />2005 Thanks For The Memory: One Star<br />2006 Still The Same: Two Stars<br />2009 Soulbook: Two Stars<br />2010 Fly Me To The Moon: One Star<br />2012 Merry Christmas, Baby: One Star<br />2013 Time: Three Starsor The Memory: One Star<br />2006 Still The Same: Two Stars<br />2009 Soulbook: Two Stars<br />2010 Fly Me To The Moon: One Star<br />2012 Merry Christmas, Baby: One Star<br />2013 Time: Three Stars

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm feeling a great deal of depression right now, which is a side effect of dying. I might as well be dead considering this book just crushed my heart, and took my breath away- no pun intended. Sadly, depression is also cause by finishing a book and not knowing what else to do with your life. But alas I must move on. Okay? Okay.
0374214913|4.0|Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore - Neat Title, Yes?<br /><br />First, let me say that I only read this book because Nate, who works at Recycle Bookstore in Campbell, harassed me.  He's recommended a few books, but this is the 1st one that he sorta insisted that I read.  So, I did.  And I'm glad.  This is very entertaining.  Robin Sloan, who lives in the East Bay, has written a book about a very old used bookstore in San Francisco.  It's open (obviously) 24 hours a day and has a very unusual clientele.  More about that in a minute.<br /><br />Clay Jannon, who is in his mid-'20's, gets a job working graveyard at Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour bookstore.  There are a couple of shelves in the front with novels, biographies, and classics.  And in the back, on shelves up to the ceiling, is something called the Waybacklist.  These are very fancy tomes with bunches of letters inside in no recognizable order.  Sometimes days go by with no clients.  And then somebody will come in, give Clay their ID, a combination of a number and 5 letters (e.g. 6WNJHY), and Clay has to climb a sliding ladder to get a specific book from the Waybacklist.  There is a handful of people who come in periodically to get one of these books.<br /><br />What the heck are these books supposed to accomplish?  Well, you'll have to read it to see.  But I can tell you that there is a secret society (with black robes), called the Unbroken Spine, that is tied into typesetters from the 15th and 16th centuries.  I can also tell you that Google's Mt. View headquarters and a number of its employees have a large part in this.  And let's not forget the fantasy trilogy, The Dragon-Song Chronicles, that Clay is addicted to.  Who knew that a fantasy series could possibly have historical significance?  Throw in some very unique characters, and I can say with some degree of certitude that you will enjoy Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.<br /><br />Besides being a good story with good characters, Robin is extremely funny and clever.  I enjoy books with humor.  2 of my favorites are Brian Haig, with his JAG lawyer, Sean Drummond, and David Rosenfelt, with his lawyer, Andy Carpenter (is it a coincidence that attorneys make for good humor?  you decide).  What makes them funny is that the humorous moments are interwoven into the story.  They don't feel forced.  Robin goes a step further.  He makes a bunch of comparisons that are laugh-out-loud funny.  Here are a couple of them:<br /><br />\\"Why do organizations need to mark everything with their insignia?  It's like a dog peeing on every tree.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's right there - I found it - but suddenly it feels too intimate, like I'm about to look through Penumbra's tax returns or his underwear drawer.\\"<br /><br />He also has some lines that are not funny but that are very clever:<br /><br />\\"His gray hair rises up around his head like a cloud of stray thoughts.\\"<br /><br />\\"Our friendship is a nebula.\\"<br /><br />I love the scenes that take place in the bookstore.  I really like the scenes that take place in other parts of the Bay Area.  And I like the scenes that take place out of the area.  Overall, though - a solid 3 out of 4.  I will look forward to anything that Robin Sloan writes.<br /><br />AUTHOR SHOUT-OUT:  I have emailed with Robin several times over the last few days.  He is always quick to respond.  I really appreciate that in an author (or anybody else, for that matter).
B007XIC1GI|5.0|I believe that I have learned as much about myself as I have learned about Marilyn Manson. This book will be read again by myself to learn even more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game should have a accessible form and I think that it  could use a lot more than just what the game is about now and I personally don't think that it is very exciting right now and it needs more passion for the people.
B00122K1SQ|5.0|This album is one of my favorites. I had to get a copy when i saw it. Prince is and will always be the man.  This is when he started refining his skills to another level. Turk
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It was better than book 2. More about their relationship. Moved a little slow.  Disappointed at first that it left you hanging but, that only means another book is in the future!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|So glad I bought this CD, initially for the single hits that were released, but found other songs just as enjoyable.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|This is probably the best album released this year. Not to mention, who would be better than Daft Punk to put something like this out?  Would anyone really want to hear another Human After All?  It's a great album but who needs a part 2?  Daft Punk really pulls together decades of dance music on this release and presents it in an original yet respectful to the era way that complements the artists who they collaborate with.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome game. fun levels. I hope they make more levels. fun to play and challenging game levels. 5 yr old enjoyed watching.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I really enjoyed the exploring with this amazing young man, his journeys negotiating his autism/aspergers disorder.  It gave great insight as a teacher of students with similar patterns, and not yet able to express their wants and desires as eloquently and clearly!!
B00122OTSE|5.0|This album is one of my favorites. I had to get a copy when i saw it. Prince is and will always be the man. My man was still raw here. he was a part of a very good time in life to me. Prince is just what i needed during this time. Hope kids now a days get to know someone such as him for their entertainment. Turk
B0081336FO|5.0|Not just an update of Conan-Doyle.  Also, an interpretation.  True to the original source, but an interesting take on it as well.  Cumberbatch and Freeman are outstanding.  Each episode is like a standalone movie.  The<br />Baskerville episode was the weakest, but more than offset by the others.  Some were &#34;edge of the seat&#34; exciting.
0425263916|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read. You have to start out with the first book of this series though. I couldn't put it down. Sylvia Day is an amazing author. I can't wait to read all of her works.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I was a big fan of Queensryche back in the RFO and Mindcrime days. This new album takes me back to that time. Scott R. Really tears up the drums on this. I have been waiting for 20 years to hear him play like this again. Buy this!  The new singer sounds a lot like vintage Tate, but it works. This album does not disappoint.<br /><br />One last thing... I also like the new Tate / Queensryche album. The songs are good. This however is the Queensryche I've been waiting for.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I don't remember the things I read about Tesla when I was at school, so I guess I owe you Sean, for your brief book on Tesla and his endeavors and for helping me to remember how inspiring Tesla is as an inventor and as a human. :)<br /><br />It's a short, engaging read and I recommend it to people who's willing to walk the path of pioneering. ;)<br /><br />Way to go Sean.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|the game is challenging but not too difficult that you give up and put it down.  it helps improve awareness and your analytical skills.  very fun.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was one that was very hard to put down. I had seen movie before I read it. But the book was better then the movie.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game so far, good job with timing of getting things upgrading only time I find myself bored on here is when I've been on it for hours!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I loved this book. There were a lot of names of battles and new names of places (of course because it is a &#34;history book&#34;)  which made them real, but also very hard to remember them all. Because  this was written as a series of short stories, you are able to focus more on the experiences and emotions of the individuals in the interviews. Very different style of writing than I am used to and I enjoyed the flow.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Is the best game of its kind the system just... amazing every one should have this game I freakano love it
B0094M2ITG|5.0|This movie might be one of the better Tim Burton movies.  I love the imagery and plot behind it.  I think most people could actually somewhat relate this to their own father.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Good read....a little hard to follow all the characters if you pick up the book and put it down often as I had to.  Great story, almost as good as the Kite book.  Highly recommend the read.  Suggested it for my book club.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I waited 8 months for this book to come out and after I finished reading it I thought that it was too short of a book. The ending was poorly written. Even though the book wasn't as great as the second I'll still be waiting to read the next one. Can't wait!
B007SGM084|4.0|Took one star away only because it is definitely erotic and may not be for all readers, but the writing is superb. I can see the places the author is writing about because of the refined descriptive writing. the storyline is very unique and the love story is unexpected. I am a voracious reader and this has been one book that has been hard to put down. It is also a nice change of pace in this crowded writing market.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I enjoy this type of entertainment and have wanted to watch episodes again.  I tell everyone how much I enjoy this series.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Really great new take on lawyers the characters are funny intelligent and like able it's like if they made a show about Barney from how I met your mother if he was a lawyer and less obsessed with banging women
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Played this game with my woman, and we had a lot of fun, until we ran out of rooms. I will definitely be on the look out for more games like this. Good problem solving brain game.
B009GESJH2|3.0|I was a little disappointed as this is not his normal sound, it was way to slow of songs on here, I liked them, but not an album i'd listen to if i wanted to stay awake.  I'm glad he is growing as an artist and I think this will reach new fans, but it is a little disappointing to his die hard fans
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Natalie Portman outdid herself.  Great work.  Good Story.  Really enjoyed movie.  Have always loved ballet and this movie gave me some insight into what it takes to be a great ballerina.
B0043URV5U|5.0|I've been a Bob Seger fan for a long time. And, I've wanted a Bob Seger greatest hits package<br />for some time. While this isn't an anthology that goes a little deeper than just<br />the hits like I'd prefer, it does cover more than the first greatest hits record in 94 did.<br />I'm really happy they included &#34;Hey Hey Hey (Going back to Birmingham).
B00005JL96|5.0|This item was a gift, but I love the movie so much that I regretted not saving it for myself. Fast shipping and a good price ..for an awesome movie! &#60;3
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I really liked this book i have just finished it reading, now i will try to get bigger leaner and stronger with everything i have learned in this book,
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book made me cry,laugh,and most of all it made a lot more deformed friends.I love this book so much you should read it
B001ER4CNY|5.0|i loved this show as a kid and couldn't believe it when they offered the whole series here.  this is so great
0307951529|4.0|You can tell that Mr. Guillebeau is no &#34;wishful thinker&#34;. He has done his homework!<br />I applaud him for his tenacious research and broad sampling of stories that make<br />up the various samples of what one might do if you decided to quite the rat race and<br />do things out of the ordinary or at least not from a cubicle. Fun and it always made<br />me want to jump out of bed!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Not for young  readers. Whore houses and rape are not subjects for children.<br />That said, i love the books and will continue to read the rest.
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|I admit there are a lot of retards posting 1 stars on this app but the majority are correct about its problems. To those who think that you can only play music that was purchased or installed by computers obviously dont look hard enough. There is a file section on the top bar where you can find your illegally downloaded music. But there are many problems. It will not work if you have your screen off with no music playing it just crashes. But DO NOT USE THE EQUALIZER OR DIFFERENT SKINS!!!!! When I did it worked great for half an hour before it broke my kindle. This is a melicious app because when i downloaded a skin download detections caught by my antivirus popped up everywhere right after I got it. This app even wouldnt uninstall. And it wouldnt let me post comments on here. I eventually got to uninstall it but beware! ITS A MELICIOUS VIRUS. And im afraid the damage done might be perminent. Dont buy!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was so attaching it felt so real and alive it changed my thoughts on reading. I wanted to just sit there reading all day
B002YOKVU4|5.0|Love this movie and it plays great and it arrived early! Was very happy with product and tracking was easy and im very satisfied :)
B003G4W49C|4.0|After reading this, I began to look at children and children's play differently.  What are we really teaching our children?  And who is teaching whom?
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This series has action packed combat scenes and great effects. The events are historically accurate and notice the marines and soldiers who fought the Japanese in the Pacific.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love the game if  you like games like this than download this game<br />You also need to try their other games
B0030ZOYHC|3.0|I love this series but i was looking forward to getting the hollow graphic cover the pictures were promising but when it came in i got some flimsy soft cover which made me mad but i just decided to keep it probably going to buy this on rightstuf for the cover because the cover is awesome but for the next evangelion im probably going to buy it from rightstuf as well because that's messed up that amazon lied and gave me a Eco friendly cover.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|This game is the shot. The controls are just like the original. If your debating to get sonic 4 or this game I highly suggest this game. The controls in sonic 4 are very frustrating. Plus this is a deeper and fuller (not sure If that's a word) game. If your a sonic fan GET THIS GAME!!!!! One of the best sonic games out there. I really wish they would do a sonic 2 app though. They recreate the casino world exactly in sonic 4, but the controls are so frustrating it's hardly worth it. PLEASE SEGA, MAKE AN APP WITH SONIC 2 WITH BETTER GRPHICS, PLEASE!!! I would pay 10 dollars for that s......t...( there is no star sign on the kinle fire... weird..) but any way get this game it's very hard but good.
B0015XASFS|5.0|It was a PBS performance that was spellbinding. I could watch it over and over.  Especially the opening number.<br />Josh is the ONLY performer I would pay to see in concert.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It was a little redundant but all in all it was pretty good. I love Eva and Gideon. Looking forward to another book to continue their love story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it's the best game ever its like taking adventures everyday you should play it make that free button change to get app to installing
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|fantastic,left me wanting more.of course.would sure love to know when next one will be released.any idea fellow readers?can't wait.<br />great!
B004I9G486|3.0|Integrates nicely and is recognized by my 2009 Audi A5, but I wished the cord was just a little longer.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have to say I hated this book. I've enjoyed this series and was very anxious to read the last book. I think I'll just pretend this one never happened. Let's face it, Eric Northman was the best character of this story. To end it by basically having him on a leash? Ugh, it was just terrible. I really just did not care for the ending at all
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this everyday. Even if I don't have my physical Bible with me, I always have my phone. Great for devotions too!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I found this book because of an article on Lifehacker. I've read other motivational, self help books before but they usually left me flat.  This one was actually very engaging and really made me feel kind of empowered. I'll probably need to go through it again and bookmark some stuff but right now I just feel good both because his plans sound doable and effective as well as because I was already doing some of the stuff on my own.  I recommend this book.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I thought that I was aware of the substance of the Holocaust, but I never had heard this part.  While this is described as a work of fiction, it probably conveys the terrible feelings of the people who were thrown into oblivion with a high degree of accuracy.  More stories like this would help people grasp the horror that we can inflict upon one another.  These sort of stories with the personal links have much more impact than the overwhelming numbers and statistics can ever convey.  If possible, readers should try to visit the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D. C.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Once it is set up, it works mostly as advertised.  It took days to get this capability to work on my HP network printer.  I spent hours on the phone with HP support.  We finally got it working and I have to give HP credit for supporting its products.  One annoyance is that support for ePrint in only available during biz hours M-F.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I like 100 floors so I enjoyed this game. Not many levels but I am sure they are working on it.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Very very happy! Great quality and completely what I wanted! I have been looking for this movie and this was a great deal. The Blu-ray and its case were in perfect condition!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|its a mixer of emotions and you can relate to it somehow and shows you how to live while laughing and learning at the same time
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This program is very userful, and I enjoyed the clean view of the it a lot. Never put me in doubt about the time left to use with my apps...Just love it!!!
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I like the countdown timer & number of exercises remaining.<br />There's no warm up or cool down (although you could probably customize the 5 min. cardio & use that as a warmup), cuing is not mirrored.  Stretch is available but it costs extra.  Got this as a FAOTD.  It works fine on my Kindle Fire HD7.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The kindle fire handles the app surprisingly well.  I can't wait to get the sliver deck unlocked.  They were always an unstoppable beast, and I'm sure that's still the case.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Love this show! Good old fashion storytelling and mystery. I love the wholesomeness of the relationships between characters... all of the dark evil drama is left to the actual cases.
0670023329|5.0|This book is worth reading. This lets us know just how lucky we are to be living in the US. Some of it is so awful I could only skim over it. Some of it is so sad it will make you cry. I hope this young man learns how to love and can adjust to the ways of our country.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is my most favorite ever my son also loves this app thank you fingersoft this is awesome gjgfvh h h b h
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|A free app that is fun to play.  While I usually look for the educational value in my apps, this one is just for enjoyment.  Sometimes even the little one need that experience.
B0000029LG|5.0|This CD collection is well done.  Many of MJ's great hits are on this set.  Love the color inserts with pictures.  Was delivered quickly and in very good condition as promised.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|because of negative reviews I saw when film initially came out, I didn't expect to like it.  I don't remember the reviews, only that most of the ones I read weren't enthusiastic.  I'm happy to say I liked it much more than I thought I would. Film is ambitious, speaks to the underdogs amongst us, and is highly romantic in a pro-humanity way.  The theme of repeated lives apparently is limited to humans, no other animals/life forms are shown as getting multiple bites at the apple.  Think I would have been more likely to accept the story's reincarnation theme if it included additional life forms.  Limiting reincarnation to people made the story seem like species propaganda.<br /><br />Humans are top dog on earth, we eat just about whatever we want, and then create fictional worlds where we create additional lives to do the same.  Not even in our imaginings do we include reincarnation for animals we consider inferior/subordinate/different from us/less than us.  We're a very species-centric animal, no matter how good, kind and sweet some of us may want to be.  Not a hater of my species, just saying.<br /><br />Two weak points in my opinion were, why did the young man commit suicide.  I know things were going badly for him and that he was being blackmailed, but I guess I didn't find the story proved well enough why he felt suicide was his only option; his suicide made no sense to me.  Another thing, why was the young freed female slave the only one who the resistance felt could lead the revolt.  I think the story didn't explain loudly enough what she brought to the table.  The rebels spent considerable time and effort freeing and protecting her, and the story didn't explain why her, exactly.  Other than what I've pointed, thought film was pretty good, I laughed, I cried.  Rate 3 and 3/4 stars rounded up to 4, as Amazon doesn't allow for fractions.  Checked it out from the library but would definitely buy it if I had the funds.  Well done filmmaking team.<br /><br />P.S. I'd buy this film, despite the flaws that in my opinion it has, because I'm a middle age women, experienced viewing film stories, and none are perfect. The film I've ever seen that got closest to perfection was Lucas's Star Wars, a New Hope.  But, I can definitely enjoy flawed films too, so I rate them honestly and buy them if I can afford to.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|You can spend a lot of time exploring all the great features in this app.  If you find a better photo editing app I would be surprised.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I show portions of this movie to my 5th grade students when we are talking about &#34;No Man's Land&#34; and how various nations have prepared for war.  The scenes of the barbed wires and the trenches &#34;bring it home&#34; for my students to get a visual image, a moving visual image, of what they read about in their history books.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I have always enjoyed the old TV shows from the '70s simply because I remember them when they were new. The only problem I had with this particular set was one of the discs were damaged. It looked like the damage occurred in the factory. The return policy setup by Amazon functions almost too well. It was taken care of so fast that you can find yourself unprepared, so have a paper and pencil handy when you contact them. I am still watching the series and have not quite yet gotten through them all and I watch one per night. The extras that come with this set will also delight most viewers. The packaging and artwork are great for a set selling at the price that this was does. The shipping was fast, both ways and I would highly recommend Amazon or this particular set to anyone that is a fan of the old TV shows.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Another good app for the Kindle.  My grandson enjoying playing with the app and even his sisters get involved in the \\"action\\".  Hey, it also free.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|So, here we have the new Queensryche album featuring the new singer Todd LaTorre. What can i say, this album is fantastic, even though i was a bit hesitant of a new Queensryche album without Geoff Tate, as i am a fan that is a pretty hardcore fan of the band. I personally loved the Tribe, Q2K, and  OM2 albums, and i do own both of Tates' solo albums. And while i don't love Dedicated to Chaos, i do still find plenty of songs that i like. I would consider myself an impartial fan as Hear In The Now Frontier is one of my top 3 albums of the band's career. The other two would be Rage For Order, and Empire. This new album fits in the #4 spot!<br /><br />Also, I bought the Tate version of the bands' Frequency Unknown, and while i didn't hate it, i didn't really love it, to me, it's just an okay album...i'd give it 2.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Now, onto this album. Oh my what a great album!!! I ignored samples and the release of the song \\"redemption\\" early as i wanted to hear the whole album before i would pass any judgement on it. This version of Queensryche nailed it. They simply knocked it out of the park. In my opinion, if you liked the Rage For Order, OM1, and Empire era of the band, then you need to buy this right now and crank it up....and just wait until you get to tracks 5 and 6!!! Pure ear candy right there! My two favorite tracks of the album, but in all honesty, every song is great!<br /><br />This album proves that Eddie, Scott, and Whip wanted to keep on rockin' and Tate was holding them back big time!!<br /><br />Also, any one complaining about the length of the album and feel that it's too short, needs to think of something. How long are most of the great classic albums from the 60's and 70's?? About the same length of this album. Think about the length of the debut album from Van Halen, or any of the Roth era Halen albums, this album is longer than them all, except for the first one, which is only 10 seconds longer. Those are all great albums that everyone loves and no one mentions anything on how short those are. Quit complaining!<br /><br />With the way things are nowadays, people don't give albums a chance for bands to have \\"classic\\" albums with all of the illegal downloading and people with unrealistic expectations. But in my mind, this album is a true Queensryche classic, and when the band is completely done and dead, i think this album will stand out as being one of their best ones that people will still talk about and tell one another \\"hey man, if you don't have that self-titled one from back in 2013, you had better get it, cause it is really good!!\\".<br /><br />In my opinion, this is the album that should have been released from Queensryche in between the Empire and Promised Land albums. This album sounds like it's from the older era, yet also sounds up to date and fresh. This is an album that any and all Queensryche fans should go out and buy, and i think that this version of the band is the one that needs and deserves the full support of their fans. This is the Queensryche of the future, and i'm not looking back, and am glad that neither are they. I can't wait for their next one already!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was really anxious to read this book, considering the ending from Catching Fire was so good. With that said, it took me a while to get into it. It just seemed like it dragged on more than anything. Probably the last section of the book is when I felt it started to pick up. I love the ending of this book, I'm very happy about how things turn out.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game! Really fun. Only thing is it wasn't long enough. I solved it in a few hours. Wish it were longer/harder.
B00005JPKE|5.0|I will be using parts of the movie to share with my 5th grade students to give them the perceptive of war from the non-U.S. point of view.  I love how it talked about the tunnel digging as I emphasize the massive tunnels that were dug as part of their strategy to prepare for war.  The stories we read about the battles in WWII mention the tunnels and so this movie helps &#34;bring it home.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is amazing game. It doesn't skip, or cost. Its great for kids also. I have never got tired of this game since ive hare it and ive had it for awhile.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|A free app that provides an entertaining experience for the player.  It's not too difficult for the younger ones and they enjoy it.  And as I said, it free, so that's another plus.
159463176X|2.0|As soon as I saw this author`s name, I was brought back to his two  previous novels, especially the Kite Runner. It is said that some great minds can only produce one or two great things. Could we be in this situation?<br />The book is interesting but so disconnected, so `back and forth` that it`s almost impossible to follow. Frankly, at the end I wasn`t sure who was who; yet I can remember every character in Proust or Tolstoì.<br />One doesn`t need 1000 pages to create memorable characters! This one misses the mark.
B000WEMH3C|5.0|the quality is first class.  i would buy this product again.  weber is the way to go.  go get it today if you need one.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Following up on the original story which was superior- a glimpse into important world history. Quirky characters and  wonderful sets make this high class soap a good viewing experience.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|This is the best movie about this terrible part of human history.  I recommend this movie to everyone.  It is for sure a movie one does not forget.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|The Amazon Free App of The Day should be an app that is a paid app, not an app that's always free!! This is still a 5 Star game, so I'm still giving it 5 stars, just like I have on the Play Store. I've been playing this game since it was launched, which was about 2 years ago. It is awesome on my Tegra 3 tablet!! Tegra 3 a adds a few extras, and its really awesome!! I'm on my second Tegra 3 tablet, and this game was amongst the first apps that I installed, as it's one of my favorites!! Highly recommended to everyone who likes racing the games, and even those who don't should still try it out!! Truly awesomely amazing game!!!
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|My granddaughters enjoy playing \\"being grown up and doing their hair\\".  This app allow them to be as creative as they want and provides them with an enjoyable experience in the process. Pleased with this app.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Id say that about 90% of this movie was pure gold. It was very well done from the acting to the pacing. It really showed you how other places in the world are in so much worse shape than what we normally experience. Overall I thought that most of the movie did a good job at seeming realistic. It was intense without seeming overdone. Unfortunately the completely lost it at the end. *spoiler* when they leave the airport, the people who CONTROL the air traffic decide that the best way to stop a moving plane is by driving in front of it. How does that accomplish anything besides getting yourself killed? They completely hollywood the ending and it didnt work at all. It was very strange because the rest of the movie felt so real.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|I decided to buy this particular package of the Toy Story trilogy as it was 1) the cheapest and 2) seemed to include what I wanted (the movies and special features, on standard blu-ray) and none of the stuff I generally don't want (DVD/Digital copies, 3D blu-rays etc.) As a result this was a substantially better choice than the standard, american version, which costs $20 more and includes all of that nonsense.<br /><br />That being said, please be aware that you are buying the UK version of this trilogy pack, which has been imported here and resold. I was not 100% clear on that so when these discs arrived with clear UK markings (ratings, disney.co.uk web addresses, etc.) I was not sure if they'd work in my American PS3. Luckily, as they advertise, these are region free and will work.<br /><br />So to summarize, if you just want the Blu-Rays of these movies, with the applicable special features, minus extra discs, this is the set to buy. Just be aware that it is not a set that is technically supposed to be available in the US.
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|It was a slow start and then picked up pace and dragged a bit again, I stuck with it though and I'm glad I did!<br />The love story was like and unlike other YA love stories, alike because its the story of two young people but unlike most of them because it wasn't the cheesy overbearing all consuming romance but more of a fight for freedom type of love.<br />It was a different concept and at first I wasn't sure I was buying it but half way in I was able to draw parallels with true society... looking forward to book 2 and 3 and the novellas in between :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great!! Very entertaining! I gave it four stars because it sometimes freezes momentarily. Other than that great game. Plus I absolutely love how they go around the world great bonus I must say! Fix the glitches and its a guaranteed 5 stars. I am also having g problems with not being able to sign into Facebook to see what my friends have been doing and that kind of sucks.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfer is a ton on fun and I like that it changes locations from time to time.  With all the earnable characters and boards there are goals that are fun to go after.  Just wish when you upgrade to a new device the characters and boards went with.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I haven't had a problem with this free app at all. It's better than the Nintendo DS sudoku I used to play in that it's really easy to pencil in the possible numbers. I haven't played this app often enough to advance beyond beginner yet, but play is smooth thus far.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Very good app the same as office, I just wished it had more  clip art and the font<br />app worked couldn't get it to install.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like that it's centered on problem solving, but I did get stuck on a few levels. Maybe one hint per level would help, but I still thought that it was very enjoyable and liked the fact that I had to think to figure it out. Can't wait for the new levels.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|What a rollercoaster of emotions this book was!<br />I gave it 4 stars just because of that, it was intense, infuriating at times and at other I was just plain out bawling. Read it in 2 days, it was that addictive, I just couldn't put it down!<br />Looking forward to reading it from Travis' point of view now :)
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love love love this cd, i only really bought it for one song but i play it through all the way. My daughter was shocked as I usually prefer music from the 1970's.
B002NT3B52|1.0|this book is too wordy and hard to follow. Very hard to understand it uses way too many words. if you make it for everyone not just scientests it would be way better
0761171703|5.0|I saw this book at a ballet/theatre shop and fell in love. I love dance and this book takes everyday situations and infuses them with beautiful and fun dance poses. I only wish this book were bigger and maybe hard cover, although the paperback price is great.<br /><br />I plan to buy another. One to cut out photos I love and frame them, and one for perusing.<br /><br />Take a look at the photographers site and see how the photos were taken. These dancers are driven and true athletes.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This has to be a classic among films about growing up in the 60s.  If you like classical music you'll certainly love the score.  But even if you don't the movie has a refreshing innocence about it that is so often lacking in films about kids. While the adults, as seen through the eyes of the kids and the audience, are comical in their inability to relate to the kids or each other.  Highly recommended.
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|This 3D review is intended for those with 3DTVs and/or fans of 3D.<br /><br />GI Joe Retaliation was originally meant to be released during summer 2012, but was delayed till March 29, 2013 to be converted into 3D. So did they have enough time to make the 3D worth our time and frustration (of GI Joe fans) having to wait even longer to see the movie in theaters?<br /><br />Absolutely. The 3D is very powerfully rendered in GI Joe Retaliation. This is not a half baked 3D effort as many of the earlier, hurried 3D conversions of films like Clash of the Titans' poor 3D. The 3D here offers unexpectedly outstanding dimension and depth in many of the cool action scenes, coupled with a generous amount of pop outs. It's been said the Snake Eyes scene was noteworthy (with Snake Eyes portrayed on the Blu Ray 3D cover), and indeed it is as the 3D gives that scene depth the likes of which are rarely seen in conversions. Thankfully the rest of the movie holds up well in 3D.<br /><br />3D Overall: 9/10<br />3D Dimension: 9/10<br />3D Pop Out: 8/10<br />3D Depth: 9/10
B00BGZ8OLA|2.0|The first hour drags with too much emphasis on religion.  When the movie finally gets around to the lifeboat scenes, they didn't feel &#34;real&#34;; they seemed contrived.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this alarm... I love being able to wake  up to good music.. I also love the solve a math problem to dismiss. I gotta be awake to do math so in order to dismiss I need to wide awake :)
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|\\"Like everyone else , I have all his other album releases on CD in my music collection. Kanye's attempt to go into a different realm of musical direction really makes this album unusually awful for me to listen to personally. I don't know about anyone else. I'm sorry that I don't like it. I like all his other albums better. Seems like a lot of rappers these days like to use that talk box robotic voice musical device too much & try to be too creative & unique to the point of over doing it. I don't like this album completely. I'm sorry to say. It's mostly because he rhymes the same single words over & over again in one sentence in ever song, not using any other available rhymable words instead of the same words over & over again & it gets annoying to me to hear. I believe he needs to find other alternative words to rhyme instead of being steady with the same word(s) to rhyme with over & over again for several rhyme sentences or versus in a row. This is not the Kanye' I know when it comes to his other more creative & well thought out & planned album releases. I know Kanye' can do better than this. I don't know what Kanye' is thinking in this album , but it seems like he doesn't know what he wants to say from one rhyme to the next because he seems to keep using the same words to rhyme sentence after sentence. It makes me wonder whether he wrote the rhymes he raps in all of these songs on his album or were they all freestyled & came out in a pressure cooker type of unpreparedness when the rhymes were said. I have heard better Kanye' West albums. Maybe his next album where he goes back to rapping the way he did in all his previous albums would be more suffice & more appropriate rather than trying so hard to go into such a completely different direction of sounds & beats. I thought I was listening to drum & bass music rather than rap. The two types of music don't go together , drum & bass & rap music. Not at all. I hated the mixture of the two types of genre. I only like all of Kanye's other albums. Not this one unfortunately. I sure wish he would go back to the way he rapped in all his other previous albums before this one. They were all better than this album for sure. That is where I know for sure his comfort zone is. His original rap style. In his other albums he never rapped the same words 3 or 4 times in each sentence in a row like he did in this album & on pretty much all the songs. He was very reptitive. Kanye' has made better albums. I will pass on buying this album altogether. I hope he goes back to his usual rhyme style & skills in his next & further future released albums. No offense to any Kanye' West music fans. I am one of them , but I have to be honest , I know that he has recorded better rhymes , songs & better albums than this one. Sorry , no offense to Kanye' or any of the other mutual fans reading this. Thank you.\\"
B00992CF6W|4.0|I was having a great time playing this game! its well designed and a great time waster. the only complaint is that I was playing one day and the game froze and made me force close. and the world ive been playing on for months was deleted when I got back and I never got it back. Its a great game but just be aware!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|After attempting to download the app on my kindle fire, I received a failure message stating &quot;this app can not be installed.&quot; It's not a space issue-I checked. I'd really like to play, but an app that doesn't install is a waste of time.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I heard the singing was a little weak in places, especially at the beginning.<br />The voices - not the recording technique. Russel Crow gets better later in the movie.<br /><br />This uses a new state of the art \\"live while film rolls\\" singing technique which is a little<br />rough in places since the orchestra is added later. As the camera rolls they sing live to a piano<br />in an earpiece. Mostly, they pull that off well.<br />It does put a lot of strain on the orchestra later as they have to follow the mood and timing of the singer...<br /><br />Mine came with a BluRay+DVD+Streaming+ a digital D/L (locked to one computer?.)<br />All for something I'd expect to pay for just a BluRay.<br /><br />I would have liked to get the referenced \\"4 hour *directors* cut\\" version on the BluRay, but most of that was<br />left on the cutting room floor. I think they cut a little too close to the bone keeping it around 2 1/2 hours.<br />Being a movie it can be more detailed as far as different things they can do that take longer on film...<br />A stage version is limited to the stage and possible scene changes, the movie can explore all sorts of things.<br />I have also seen this subject matter live on stage.
1609611543|5.0|I have a whole new insight into wheat and the harm that has been done to it!  It saddens me to think that future generations will become ill from eating wheat products, I worry about my grandchildren!!<br />Education is the key to preventing illness and I am so happy that William Davis is bringing this to our attention, my hope is that future generations will reverse the damage that is being done to a very important food staple.
B000MV90IU|5.0|I have watched all or parts of this movie many times and love it. I had to have it for my collection on Blu-ray. Seller delivered on time in great shape - I'm happy.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great back and I used all the time and if it's all my gear great(camera, camcorder, tripod, tripod weights iPad, laptop, gopro, multiple goPro mounts, 3 lenses,)
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This is still one of my favorite series because of the world, the creatures and the characters! It's a big season (24 episodes) so it starts out slow and builds, after episode 8 it picks up and gets much better! It's still nothing compared to the books and the detail Terry Goodkind creates but the show adds something of its own to walk hand and hand with the books instead of compete with them
B005HSG3U6|2.0|While the case itself fits the Kindle very well and the cover does provide scratch protection to the screen, I bought it because I wanted something that would cause the kindle to have a simple stand of some type. While this does have a stand, it really only works when the Kindle is on a flat surface and does not work at all, for example, standing on your lap or knees while you are commuting or just sitting in your favorite chair. The cause is very clear: the groove that was cut in the cover to act as a 'holder' for the flap cover is just not deep enough to do so reliable on uneven surfaces. Ideally, the groove shoud have been deeper and should have had a bit of an angle inside the grove to more securly hold the flap cover so that it would not continually fall out of place. I will be returning this item as it clearly was not given enough thought about how most people use Kindles, i.e., they don't sit at a desk while watching their Kindle--they are stretched out on the sofa with the Kindle on their abdomens or in their favorite chair with the Kindle on their lap or on the train with the Kindle on their knees, etc.
B0018M6J90|2.0|If you have read the book and loved it, then don't bother with the movie. Relationships are tangled (wrong people are paired with the different people than in the book) and some characters in the book that act in part, as fairy godmother (as far as transforming Miss P into something), are depicted as mean and devious in the movie. Hollywood has worked it's black magic once again and has turned a wonderful story that needed no changes into a mediocre, at best, movie. Pick up a copy of the book  Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day---you won't be disappointed!
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Will definitely read more by this author. Did not want to put the book down. Sure didn't guess the ending on this one.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Never thought I would be watching a show about &#34;zombies&#34; but this show has the perfect amount of zombie to real person issues.  LOVE IT!
B009C7JS14|4.0|Good app. The only thing about it that could be better is to let it have more than 2 locations. To get more locations you have to buy the upgrade.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Beautifully told story. You want to hold this treasure of a book in your heart and never let it go
B009E3EY4M|5.0|For all the fans that put up with early attempts to capture the sound of Led Zeppelin, THIS IS IT !, do not make any excuse not to have this in your collection, it is what has been missing all these years, the sound is full range, the video is crisp, (enough to remind me of my age as well) overall a must have, and having Bohnam Jr. doing a fantastic job filling some big shoes.<br />well worth the wait ....and the price
0920668372|5.0|Bought this for my daughters. My mother had this book when I was younger and now it is a great addition for my daughters' books.
B003K16PFU|4.0|Repeatedly, without concern, Orwell appeals for the reader's emotional understanding. Tis not needed. His actions speak for themselves during this most trying of human times.<br />Makes one wonder: who is this guy?
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|my 5 year old son loves dinosaurs and watched this 3 times within the 48 hours we rented it. Classic
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Hardly any content in the book.  She just published it to make money and then make us buy another book to find out the ending.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|My husband (a Trek fan) and I (non-Trekkie) both loved this movie - by far the best movie we have seen in several years. Great action, fun plot, good characters - all around an excellent movie!
B00846REIS|5.0|Easily one of my most favorite books. Gideon is hot and temperamental. Eva isn't annoying and I love beastie. Can't wait until the 4th book is released.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|My kids loved it! This got my 10 year old interested in reading. I couldn't ask for anything more than that :)!

B009HUB40Y|5.0|Totally fun and exciting! Great free game. Entertaining and exhilarating. I was looking for Bejeweled and found Booty Quest. Gave it a try and I love it!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|worth the watch, especially since the sequel is about to be released. very funny and clever action movie with great cast.
1449389627|5.0|I do not consider myself as an innovator but I enjoy seeing/doing things creatively. This book will be one of my top favorites. Here is some concepts attracted me most:<br />1. Every innovation is a collective work. It is very naive to think only one person invented something all by himself/herself.<br />2. Great ideas comes from reusing existing ideas<br />3. Just the idea is no good, do a proof of concept before bragging about it.<br />Very well written with humor and hard data. It is a rare combination!<br />And there are many more. The points applies so well to anyone who wants to live a conscious/creative life, doesn't matter you form a company or not:). That's why I am liking the \\"Myth of innovation\\" so much! Being an ex-microsoftie I feel proud as well:).
0393327655|5.0|Excellent review of impact of religion on world today; everyone should read this book for an understanding of the impact religious thought has on individual and collective lives
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Like the reality of it.<br />Enjoy the presentation of the Time Period.<br />The writers have done a great job by bringing the time period changes together.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked this book, which was the 3rd read by this author.  Only disappointment was some similarity in the formula of the story.  Kahled Hosseini writes wonderful stories that allow you to view how life is different and more difficult in other stories, while realizing that people are the same throughout the world..
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I'm twenty nine years old and In about three weeks it's my birthday and the feelings that the man has is the feeling I have right now. Pass or fail as person. I'm I going down th right path. Making the right choices. That's what I got from this beautiful story. Did this book answer my questions...No lol. But I guess nothing can.
B00005LOUP|5.0|This is like the 4th time I've bought this through Amazon. Its a great film and my kids love it. They've gone through three copies because they watch it so much.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|This album picks up where Black Way Gives Way to Blue left off. It is stylistically almost identical. This is Alice In Chains version 2.0 where Jerry Cantrell is responsible for 90% of the creative output of the band. Layne Staley is no longer with us, so Cantrell has taken it upon himself to become Alice In Chains' pseudo-lead singer. He fills the role nicely here. William Duvall is a competent second guitar player and second vocalist. There is only one song where Duvall takes the lead, the rest of the time there is a Cantrell/Duvall harmony that breaks down to a 70/30 split in the mix. Basically, you can hear Cantrell's voice a lot more with this version of AIC than Duvall's, and that's a good thing. Inez on bass and Kinney on drums are great as always.The album has a clean sound with sharp production. Nothing groundbreaking, but pleasing to the ear nonetheless. Most of the songs are noticeably of a slow to mid-tempo. There are no facepeelers on this album. It is a sludgy, moody, laid-back album that makes for great hi-fi headphone listening. It is very reminiscent of Cantrell's solo albums which makes a lot of sense if you think about it. Fans of Alice In Chains should really like this album. It is no Dirt, for sure. Layne Staley is an irreplaceable talent, and his absence is always noticed on an Alice In Chains record. However, Alice In Chains have created a good album that contains flashes of greatness. Good rock and metal is a rare thing these days, you should buy it. 4/5
159463176X|5.0|Another excellent story; different structure from first two but a very strong story line and cast of actors; recommended reading

0307744434|5.0|I sat down to read this book about six hours ago. Since then, I stood up twice: once to go to the bathroom and once to eat dinner. Other than that, I found myself inexplicably glued to this book. I'm typically the type of person who savors the literature I read, really take my time with it, and never set time away to specifically read. This book (actually in First Edition, First Printing Hardcover) has been sitting on my bookshelf for about a year now and I can't stress enough how much I regret not picking it up sooner.<br /><br />The plot circles around two magicians, Celia and Marco. They are bound (literally) from the first few pages of this novel and the story grows with them over the course of about 20 years by my count. Along the way, there is a large ensemble cast of easily identified, if not fully fleshed-out, characters that are a delight to take in.<br /><br />The book alternates between characters, time periods, and viewpoints as author Erin Morgenstern delicately weaves a tale about love, free will, and style. There are tons of characters to follow, but never once does it feel like the author is spending too much time in period or on one character. The chapters are, at most, like four pages long, so even if you are bored (you won't be), you're always only ten pages away from the next development in your favorite character's storyline.<br /><br />This book was surprising in how gripping it was. There is never a pressing issue, no threatening antagonist. Instead, throughout the background of the slowly-unfolding story, the overarching threat of the bond between Celia and Marco, an unidentified \\"Game\\" or \\"Challenge\\" looms over the characters and their actions. While this is a very well-plotted and romantic novel, there is something so intimately grabbing about it's conflict, that really sucks the reader in and leaves them wanting more. I mean, I'm still shocked that I read this book in a day.<br /><br />The atmosphere of the novel is what most people will praise when they recommend this book to you. Morgenstern has achieved an almost perfect balance of strong-but-subtle visual imagery and minimalist prose. Every scene in this novel comes to life in interesting, vivd snapshots that provide each and every scene with gorgeous backdrops and poetic settings.<br /><br />That isn't to say, however, that this book is without flaws.<br /><br />The Characters in this book are hit or miss. By my count, there are somewhere around 20 main characters (that's definitely over-exagerrated), on top of that there are a small handful of bonus characters that serve to forward the plot. Chopping off the latter group (that would be criticizing low-hanging fruit), there are still a lot of characters that never reach full potential. Most noticeably are the founders of the night circus itself, a group of five people, each identified by some random trait or other. They get the job done, but I would have loved some more development with them, specifically Chandresh Christophe Lefevre, who we get only brief tidbits of.<br /><br />In addition to the characters, the writing is a little cringeworthy at times. Morgenstern made the decision to craft the entire book in the present tense. I am already not a fan of novels written in the present tense (I think it sounds sloppy and unprofessional), but I could have stomached it if it weren't for the chapters that used both present tense and second person point of view. Admittedly, I skimmed through those, and almost skipped them altogether. Tehy proved very relevant to the plot, and Morgenstern essentially had a plot device that explained them away. Regardless, the present tense took me out of the moment a few times.<br /><br />If I list two flaws here, you ask how can it be five stars?<br /><br />I have never finished a book in one day before. At least, not in recent memory. Maybe a few on a long flight or car ride, but I have never willingly given up time to read an entire book in one afternoon before. And for that, I want to thank Morgenstern for the opportunity. I know it's a measly token of appreciation, but I hope this extra five star review will net her more book purchases and thus more money. This was an excellent treat. I hope you all reading this enjoy it as mucha s I did.nd for that, I want to thank Morgenstern for the opportunity.

B009HUB40Y|4.0|Just can't stop playing a lot of games similar to this one but this is one of my favorites wicked fun.
0618918248|3.0|Full disclosure: I am a Christian so from the beginning I was biased. But I do have an open mind and wanted to hear what the other side had to say. It really could be summed up in one page. That page would say: while some believe in God we believe in science. Some have faith God will explain it all someday while we have faith science will explain it all someday ( including the reasons some think we need God). In the meantime we're just smarter than everyone else and one day when you stop believing in God you'll be as smart as us too.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This was a truly amazing movie that I would recommend to anyone who likes a good action movie. It was a lot of fun!!! Five stars!!!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|The games really good fun to play and I have fun play it and the guns are cool their class are cool
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game the only problem is that it does not allow me to connect to my Facebook account on my kindle fire hd
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|I loved the movie, but when I got the 3D DVD it played once without problems, the next day I was going to watch it with a friend and it would not play. It just showed the Walt Disney castle and would not do anything else. I returned it for a replacement and the replacement would not work it just showed the WD castle. I tried the 3 other 3D movies I have and they played fine. There is a problem with these 3D DVD. I will buy it agin when this problem is fixed.
0761171703|2.0|this is a picture book and has no story or plot it would only appeal to a small child just looking at pictures.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I order this product because it was cheap an I needed an extra charger. It came it bad condition an I plug it into my kindle fore and nothing happen. The part where u plug the charger head in was coming apart. I really wasn't mad because it was under $10. Still I was disappointed that it didn't work. SMH I GOT GOT!!!!!!! Don't buy from this store or person.
B000TFHJJQ|5.0|This is a truly amazing movie from a really great star actor Sylvester Stallone. I have watched this movie probably six times already and it never gets old. The scenery is truly spectacular and the scenery is incredible. I really love this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day has done it again. Eva and Gideon's love story is one of my favorites and I can't get enough. The way Sylvia writes makes you care about every character in the book. You feel like you know these people and you are rooting for them every step of the way. I can't wait for book four!!!
B005KJ6ECY|5.0|Wonderful historical series.  JRM really brings Henry VIII to life. Never knew the real story around the mythical figure.  I'd like to see a follow-up series about his daughters Mary & Elizabeth I.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Such a great movie, and an unforgettable experience that any young family can enjoy. The plot is an astounding mix of childhood fantasies and S&M. Gretel really made the movie worth watching. I love that she had so much character development and was more then just some leather chick thrown into random action scenes every few minutes. And the writers did a great job with the plot; all five minutes of it. An experience no avid movie-lover should miss.
B00B7PIRIE|1.0|We were so disappointed when our gift se nt to family overseas was defective. They were n OT able to watch Season Two at all.
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|Can't beat Hans Zimmer in almost any movie, but this is one of his best works yet. Great sound track.

0525952926|5.0|Outstanding as usual.  This is probably his finest work to date and I cannot wait for Book Three.  Exceptional writer.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Wonderful historical series.  Can't wait to watch season three.  Who knew all the intrique behind the papacy at this time in history.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This movie was definitely worth purchasing. I loved the witch of the west. They gave her character, a reason to be pissed, and it does help that Mila Kunis played her. My only beef with Mila playing the role is that once the witch goes green, her voice is still Mila's. It felt strange, but that doesn't detract from the five stars I feel this movie deserves.<br />This movie is clean and perfect for the whole family. It is a nice take on the Wizard of Oz story.<br />I think this movie got so many negative reviews because it's not Wicked. I was upset by this too because I would love a good movie adaptation to Wicked.<br />Regardless, check this movie out, be irritated by Glenda's uptightery, and enjoy.<br />And I love the flying monkey. Oz is so mean to him, and that made the movie for me.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good movie especially the ending and mix of super hero was great. Liked iron man the best yet hulk stole the show
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I rate this a 4 because it takes too long to unlock another jetpack. The graphics are awesome.just trust me.<br /><br />Randomsolider23 reporting. Next opinion on blitz brigade.<br /><br />(Games I have done) talking john dog free, minecraft survival craft, worldcraft)
B00B4VXQC8|1.0|I have been a fan for years. I have bought every CD. What About Now is boring at best. Each track is mid to slow tempo with nothing that sets one song apart from the next. This effort was a disappointment musically and lyrically. The songs consist of tired cliches and corny lyrics. One of the songs has a line that says something like \\"you can sit on my lap in the electric chair.\\" I'm sure I didn't quote this exactly but this CD was painful to listen to. Bon Jovi's music has slowly declined. The last CD I loved was Have A Nice Day. I was also disappointed with The Circle and Lost Highway but I may give them another listen because I don't remember those efforts being as mediocre as What About Now. I have always liked Bon Jovi for the music and song writing ability but this CD does not rise any where near the level established by their previous work. I think one star is a very generous rating for this effort.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I took my 4-year-old daughter to see this in the theater so we got the 3D experience as well, so this was a repeat of a movie that we already knew we loved.  I highly recommend seeing it in 3D if you can, but the 2D version is almost as cool.  Neat take on how Oz and the Wicked Witch of the West came to be.  :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its good for passing time. the games are a little harder than I expected but its still good to play when you want to pass time
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Loved the intense thinking you needed to do. Graphics were great. Mini puzzles loved them.  Need more hidden object game like this one.
B005IFZ36I|5.0|Lovecraft's writing almost calls for it to be read from a massive hardcover tome and this book very closely provides that. High quality construction with luxury appointments and the text is easy to read. An exceptional buy.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|At first I was getting bored with Lena's attitude and it seemed like the same things over and over but it got better towards the end (*Possible Spoiler Alert*) although I kind of wish things had worked out with Liv.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|great constant go back to game. keep you busy for months of enjoyment, even without buying the real money upgrades!
B00116FT6M|5.0|Seeing John Travolta sing and dance as Edna Turnblad was so funny. A light-hearted flick to enjoy on a rainy afternoon.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Just like the others in the series, I read this book in less than 24 hours! I was completely hooked from start to finish. The only thing that bothered me was the ending...I was under the assumption that this was a trilogy. No no no! There is a fourth book to the series and I can't wait for it's release!
B00821PCJS|5.0|I waited forever it seems for this series to hit Netflix or Amazon Prime. Of course Amazon got it first. I wouldn't watch the current season until I caught up with the seasons previous. I have watched seasons 1 and 2 and it was great. Scifi heaven with great story line. Picture quality was also very good. Only problem is season 3 is not under prime membership and the episodes are limited. I need more. They have me hooked so I will be paying for season three.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Wish you could get more crystals faster. Things cost a little too much and take a while to build new suits.

B0091REZMW|4.0|haven't been playing very long and I don't understand how to get to other rooms but it is fun.<br />_
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Like so many I bought the books after watching the Red Wedding episode. I am glad, haven't read in a while, I forgot how much I enjoyed it. Also it shows me how much the TV show was like the books (sorry book snobs). They did a fantastic job.<br /><br />The story is amazing, I find myself as fully engrossed as I was reading the Lord of the Rings and Narnia books as a boy. Now Martin isn't as good a writer as Tolkein or Lewis but he is truly very good.<br /><br />The story is not for people expecting a simple story line. It does require keeping many balls in the air and there are SOOOO many characters but if you just sort of go with it, it is an amazing ride.<br /><br />I have one complaint that everytime I unlock the book in my kindle app on my ipad it refreshes the page. I realize it is trying to sync but I haven't noticed that with other books. Also the fact that all 4 books are 1 long kindle book might be why that is happening.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|We used to have this movie, but my ex took it after the break up ;( But I was so excited to get this one in the mail! Love love love it!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is AWESOME. Great graphics. Wonderful story lines. I honestly was upset when I completed it. I have great anticipation for part 2
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|All I can really say is epic! XD Battling is my favorite part of the game because you get to kill boggans like in the movie.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|It's comfortable in my &#34;medium-sized&#34; hands, most of the buttons are easily reachable and I get good feedback. I use all of the weights, makes it feel like a much more substantial piece of equipment.
B008B1BL4E|4.0|Some events are so complex that they defy crisp analysis and yet so important that they must be analyzed.  The origin of the Great War is foremost amoung these.  Clark does a fine job of answering the riddle of Great War causation: how epic destruction was wrought, not by the villainy of great men, but by intemperance and miscalculation.  Impeccably researched, richly detailed, and convincingly argued, Clark's work is nearly as magisterial and far more readable than Albertini's.  Yet it is difficult going for the general reader.  The prose is often infelicitous.  Even as I marveled at facts and insights absent from previous reading about the July crisis, I yearned to take out a red pen and annihilate needless words, sentences and paragraphs.  It is riddled with jargon about &#34;power oscillations&#34; and other high sounding things that and find little support in its more workmanlike passages and only detract my its narrative acumen.  It also raises as many questions as it answers.  Russia takes the plurality of the blame, yet the reader is left wondering why Russia risked so much only so soonafter it put down a bloody rebellion and so shortly before peace would have made it a superpower.  Despite its flaws, Sleepwalkers is essential reading for anyone who is serious about this subject.  The opening chapters on Serbia are fabulous and contain insights absent from much of the other literature.  Clark is a smart man and an excellent scholar who deserves a better editor.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|It is very comfortable, I like the padded shoulder straps.  It does have adequate storage and plenty of pockets for sorting.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I feel a little odd giving another 5-star review. It seems I've put together a string of those lately, but I can't ignore my duties. I wanted to offer my $.02 to go along with all the other pennies added to the penny jar.<br /><br />I'm going to take a different approach with this review compared to the others here on Amazon by stating this is my first 'In This Moment' album, and the only reason I own it is because of how different it sounds from their earlier releases. It's not that their early works are bad, but they are unremarkable, especially when listened to next to \\"Blood\\". I heard plenty of their early work on Pandora, and while it was decent, none of it really stood out. The first single I heard from \\"Blood\\" was the title track. This is a far superior track to anything they'd released prior, but it still didn't convince me this was destined to be a breakout album. However, a friend of mine loaned me the disk, and I was in absolute shock from the opening moments of \\"Rise With Me\\" straight through \\"11:11\\". It's tracks like \\"Burn\\" that literally sent chills down my spine. Independently, these songs sound diametrically opposed in sound, tone and tempo, yet they flow seamlessly as a collective unit. This may be the best album of 2012.<br /><br />For what its worth, \\"Blood\\" has been in my must-play rotation for three months , and I've enjoyed it enough to go back to their earlier releases to see if I might have missed something. Sadly, I still feel the same about their early albums. They're good, but not great. You can hear the potential woven intermittently as brief passages buried within a song here or there, but the potential is never quite realized. To me, that speaks volumes to how powerful \\"Blood\\" is, and what a groundbreaking release it truly is. I look forward to more efforts like this one with INM's future efforts.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|If you're looking at Django for any kind of accuracy, you'll think someone is dumber than a box of rocks. If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino and his ability to make a half real, half make believe and 100% entertaining story, then you might consider this among his top shelf work. In this movie you'll find comedy, romance, violence, and a well stitched cast of characters that will have your attention anticipating the next scene.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|People continue to be surprised when Kanye West does something special. I continue to be surprised, when people are surprised. It simply doesn't make sense. From his first \\"College\\" release he has proven to be a unique voice with an amazing vision on where he wants his music to go. The less talented around him follow, waiting for his lead.<br /><br />The CD case is a good indicator of what to expect, a plain, clear jewel box with a hot-orange tab. What's inside is stark and simple like the case, with an aggressive punch of sound or lyric (the tab.)<br /><br />This is the equivalent of a Sonic Boom to Rap music. It marks the start of a new era. Like all good design, \\"Less is more\\" and West capitalizes on this mantra. He also retains his innate intuition when to puncture the calm.<br /><br />His lyrics have always been razor sharp and this release is no different. Much has been said about, \\"...hurry up with my damn croissants!\\" but the release is loaded with gems. It is also sprinkled with talent and samples. I especially like the collaboration he has with Justin Vernon on two cuts (\\"Hold My Liquor\\" and \\"I'm In It.\\") The sample of Nina Simone singing,\\"Strange Fruit\\" on \\"Blood on the Leaves\\" retains her passion, but accents the point he is making. I think it is a perfect blend. Picking out these few features, is however like picking your favorite child. With a whole that is so superb, this paragraph almost reduces the remainder and it would be unconscionable for me to give that impression.<br /><br />This may be West's crowning achievement (thus far, no doubt.) Should anyone be surprised if it is exceed with his next? Not me.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have an old vinyl LP, by Nicole Williamson, reading The Hobbit. Loved the story, only heard the LP 5 times. I have now watched the movie four times. Great job of following both book and record.<br />  I can't wait for the second part...!!!
B00C061I3K|1.0|This CD is terrible.<br />I was expecting tracks like \\"One more time\\" or sounds like the Tron soundtrack.<br />This CD sounds like they were making porn music in an elevator.<br />I will not put money into a CD like this again without completely reviewing the tracks first.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I like very much reading about people in other cultures.  Americans are often so focused on their on lives that they forget that the United States is just a small part of the world.  We can't help people in other cultures unless we understand them.  I think Mr. Hosseini does a good job of explaining that in what I would call his fictional biographies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very relaxing to play.A lot of fun even when your fingers don't want to work correctly. This is a great and fun game to play . . . did I mention its a fun game to play! Was able to get this game as a app for my kindle fire. My only issue with this App is you need to let the kindle set for a few minutes to get everything working at full speed. It works great, just let it set for about 1 minutes before you start playing.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is super fun but needs an update adding adventure levels and also needs to get melon seeds other than making a nether reactor. But other from that AWESOME job!  ;)
B00C061I3K|5.0|Its not a typical daft punk jam album. Its a nice background album. I've played this numerous times in the background at pool parties. This is not a typical dance floor album but one for you to enjoy with your friends and just marvel at the greatness of the duo.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|And old musical that continues to hold the interest of children and provide evidence that real boys can sing and dance.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The only bad part of the book is when it ended... Now I have to wait forever until the next one comes out !
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Perfect for a rainy afternoon or a wait at the doctor's office. Not overly difficult but certainly not easy. Recommended!
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I really wanted to like this book, but it's convoluted premise and dragged out plot lead to an even more disappointing ending.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|love this song as the first single of the album. The album as a whole is very good and I suggest you buy the whole thing.
076781326X|5.0|This old musical does not lose its ability to engage children even in the age of technology.  Transition to DVD is well done.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|The Great Gatsby Robert Redford great movie great actor! No body does it like Robert Redford. Highly recommend great entertainment
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I loved it i just cant stop playing it, it really grows My skills to play it. And it helps me think on every posibility i have.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved this book as I have all of Jodi Picoult books. It is one of those hard to put down books.
B000SP3DE2|3.0|Not exactly true to the book but a lot closer than most movies made based on<br />Bram Stoker's Imagination.Still hoping some one will make one that's more accurate.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Love it<br />A classic a favorite of mine always. A great read for all ages and all seasons of the year
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy this book buy I read it because it was awarded a Pulitzer. I ended up totally hooked on this book and found it hard to put down. I learned so much about North Korea, a desperately poor, secretive country that condemns its citizens to a harsh existence with no individual freedom. While this is a work of fiction the author thoroughly researched his topic making the story an accurate portrayal of life in North Korea.
B0083Z614S|4.0|The story was one of my favourite childhood movies and I'd never read the book. It's an easy ready story that is still as enchanting as the movie was.
B00BEYYEE4|2.0|Predictable, poorly edited, dare I say poorly acted with subpar ending. If your friend has this DVD and you got nothing remotlely interesting to do, watch it! Not worth purchasing.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Seeing the movie first gave me Pi's voice which was nice.  The writing flows with the cadence of the Indian speaker which is pleasant.  The story amazes and then touches your heart with its poignancy.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|She loves it. The monkey helps to not lose the paci, she loves her little monkey friend. Would buy for someone else.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Good story line and tons of laughs!  Highly recommended for the young and old alike.  You won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Was a nice movie passed the time flying on a plane. Would watch again. Was interesting and exciting. Left me watching.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|In the beginning wasn't sure about the movie, but glad we stuck with it, as it was very good.<br />Very different entertaining movie.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was easy to read and hard to put down.  It was interesting see how the scientist's beliefs changed after his near death experience, and I am so glad the author was able to share all of the details he was able to remember.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I could read it a thousand times! One of my favorites and I would highly recommend this series to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A fun puzzle game where you have to find all the 'puzzle pieces' to find the key to advance to another floor. I rage quit a bunch but still is very entertaining. Definitely would recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game owwww I love playing this game everyday get up to new levels n go to difference states it's kool
B00CDT41RY|5.0|The director did it again!  Tarentino movies are always good.<br />Reminded me of the spaghetti westerns, but with a twist.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|need I say more, its lilo and stich for gods sake, I sing along to the moves in my attempt to speak something I don't understand...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a very addicting game. It is the most amazing game I've ever played! It is so fun! I recommend you buy this!
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I really really like this game but, since the update almost all the chests require pearls to open them. I know its how you make money but its really annoying and somethimes not worth it. I will rate five stars and put it on my facebook if you can calm down on the amount of pearls you need for some of the plants and chests. ive already spent money on this game and I don't think its fair..
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is fun good time waster addicting really awesome better than most love it want to have its babys seriously love it
B00CRS5HII|5.0|But ... I will listen to Darius sing ANYTHING.  This collection is fun and will have you singing along real quick.  Just saw him live and he was incredible!

B001CL4N68|5.0|The greatest Nas album...  if you don't own this album... you are most likely not a real fan of hiphop.  Get your life together.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I got it yesterday and watched it the same day! I love this movie! This is by far my favorite version! Thank you again!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game app free for the kindle<br />Wish it wasn't connected to facebook what pain the cost make changes could also be updated
B009GEDP26|5.0|Stana Katic should receive award for best actress! She and Fillion are the best couple ever in dramedy series! Great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was amazing I got it because friends told me to and its awesomeness at its max I love it very much I play it all the time
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Well written.  Good actors.  Posh set design.  Interesting timeline from Titanic start through WW1.  We don't usually watch Masterpiece shows, but Downton Abbey is currently the first thing we want to watch ahead of all other options,  any night of the week.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I started by watching the pilot and became hooked by the end.  I am up to season 4 and will finish the series within a week.  I love this show.  Sorry it is now off the air.  My warning to you is be aware -  you will not be able to stop watching, once you start.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|It's lightweight, it looks great, it doesn't interfere with any of the controls. It would be perfect if the stand was easier to use but I don't regret my purchase. If you place the flap into the groove, which you must do with some care, and leave it on a steady surface, you'll have no problems with it. I cant add much that hasnt already been said here and am only commenting on the only negative. I like the cover a lot and have had it for about 4 months.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The Dark Knight trilogy is a gritty, slightly more realistic telling of the Batman tale. Starring Christian Bale as Batman and an all star cast of villains stretched across the three movies, if you're a fan of Batman or just want an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, you should definitely check out The Dark Knight Trilogy.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I think this app is awesome.  It's super fun and entertaining, I would highly recommend this game to everyone.  It's family friendly, and really good graphics.  I think you should get this app!!! :3
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Waited so long for this and WOW she didn't disappoint! What a page turner and to think we still get MORE! I am so glad it's not ending! What a cliff hanger too!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The Harry Potter collection of movies on blu ray discs played perfectly without problems and I was very satisfied with them.
0425252868|5.0|I am a life-long reader of any story or history of WWII with special interest in the Europe theater. A story of the air war over Europe is almost like a heavy weight fight, one defending his home land & the other trying to destroy it with uncomprising intent. British night bombers suffers horrible losses. Before the long range fighter protection, the American light(B-25, B-26) & heavy( B-17, B-24) suffered loss rate was 15-25 percent from formations of 200- 300 planes to attacks from ME-109 & FW-190 German fighters coupled with accurate 88 mm flak. On Black Tuesday in Oct '43, 60 B-17 bombers out of 189 were lost going trying to bomb an aircraft ball bearing factory in ~Swienfurt, Germany. Most of the remaining bombers that returned were declared a total loss. This brought the 8th air force to its knees. This book is surreal to be true. Read!!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I enjoy using this app and it is very user friendly. The fraction part is great for figuring measurements quickly.
159463176X|2.0|In the beginning the tone was somber, but the story was gripping, the writing beautiful, expectations for what was to come were high.  I couldn't read fast enough.  Soon I found myself &#34;skip reading.&#34;  The characters were no longer fascinating, Some seemed inconsequential to the original story. Others I thought were interesting were poorly developed later on.  The beginning offered so much promise, yet morphed into an opportunity missed.  Sorry, I just didn't like it.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Nice game,  but like others have said,  a little too fast.  Not good for my motion sickness either,  I honestly feel a little dizzy now.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|&#34;More free space needed&#34;<br />I have 5gb free on my phone, and I'm told more free space is needed.<br /><br />Everyone on earth has my phone, so why does this bug still exist?
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun, addicting game. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because sometimes there is a lag. Otherwise, it is a great way to pass the time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these escape games!! Not the normal hidden object game...these are a great way to test your patience and work out the ole brain!!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It's an okay version but you don't have a lot of capabilities that other tablets might provide you like reviewing comments, etc. It's good of just want a viewer but if you need something more, go for the full version - which this app is constantly pushing before every video.
B0045HCJG2|5.0|This was the year of '86, after Rocky IV, and Rambo: First Blood Part II. Sly teams up with his then wife, Brigitte Nielsen in a action movie about the Vice Squad looking to take a group of fascists who have been committing a number of senseless murders throughout the city down. Nielsen, who had witnessed a friend of hers getting murdered, is now in protective custody of Nick Cobretti, or Cobra and others of the squad. If you're a true fan of Stallone, you should check this one out if you haven't already seen it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My wife and daughter both love this game. My wife could not put it down and finished it all in one night.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was a very well written moving piece; must say I liked it even more than the previous Two books.
B0051HNMTI|3.0|It really makes for a good workout but one of the key things that people make mistakes with is proper form. I tend to let my form slip after several reps, so it really helps when an instructor reminds you about proper alignment
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It's not as bad as most of the reviews states.  Sure, we all are upset that the story is now being stretched out to a fourth or fifth book, but other than that, it is an okay read.    What I don't like is how Ms. Day deviated from the origal story line.  Doing so really took the love from what could've been a great triology and shifted a four/five part series to a WTF?  This story was supposed to be about Eva and Gid, but it wound up being all but that.  The extra plots and story lines ***SPOILER ALERT***(Russian Mob; her roommate's problems and love life; her co-worker's problems and love life; her parents love making; his exes and their issues, which now includes two new characters--a reporter who is his ex flame or whatever you want to call it and his ex-fiancee's husband; sex tape...and more)  are a definite no-no.    Would I read the next one or two books from this originally said triology? I honestly don't know.
B0091THRCU|5.0|Excellent case. High quality, very stylish, and affordable. Purchased one several weeks back but lost it in a cab so am purchasing a replacement.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I don't like most games on the computer...but I love this little car racing game.<br />It's addictive!! Good for all ages.
0736083863|5.0|I'm a certified pilates instructor and I just loved this book. The graphics are excellent and the descriptions very thorough and vivid. Highly recommended.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|A fantastic book. I know it's a true story, but sometimes I find it hard to believe. A book you can't put down.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Way too much back and forth to find clues or pieces. Its fun though and will continue to play the game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!! Entwined With You had me really entwined with Gideon and Eva's story. I love it how it is about their relationship and what is going on in their everyday life. You start to really like Gideon and love him for the sacrifices that he does just to be with the one that he loves. It shows that no matter some past is horrible that they are able to move on from it with the help of someone who cares for them deeply and wants nothing but the best for them. I love the pics that Sylvia Day left on her website to you get more involved into the story and those photos had you guess how it tied in with the story of Gideon and Eva. I really hope that Sylvia does it again because once you start reading the book you are trying to figure out how a beach would tied into the story or how flowers tied in as well.  I hope that Sylvia does the photos teases again when Captivated By You is getting ready to come out because I love guessing how the photos tied in with each other.<br /><br />For those who thought that Sylvia Day did a bad job by breaking Gideon and Eva's story into a quintet is wrong. I think that was the best way to tell the whole story of Gideon and Eva without fast-forwarding months or years done the road. Their story is about pain, lost of innocence and finding and losing and finding love all at the same time. I believe she was trying to build the trust of the characters with each other and with us as the readers as well. That way we would keep coming back for more and wanting to learn more about their story and WANTING!!!! more all at the same time.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|What more can be said that hasn't already been said.  They pulled it off, just have a listen.  Some might say even better than the original (singer, that is).
0770437400|5.0|I felt this was written very well, especially enjoying the format. Many different viewpoints and informative. Zombies give it your best shot because I now know how to react in self defense.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read. It's funny, romantic and just so cute. And the footnotes weren't bad either. Lol.
159102594X|4.0|I picked this up after reading reviews of Miles Cameron and Brandon Sanderson, two new authors I gushed over throughout there novels.<br /><br />Joe Abercrombie writes solidly, reminding me somewhat of Robin Hobb. His characters are excellently built in a new and exciting way. The story unfolds well and follows a good path.<br />The thought processes of Inspector Glokta, as well as being a cripple definitely highlighted this book. The Bloody Nine delivered a solid performance. And I was consistently intrigued by the cat and mouse game of Jezal and Ardee, rich vs commoner, would love prevail?<br /><br />While the book reads well, there were parts my mind chugged to a halt, Abercrombie struggles with maintaining more than an interest in his writing. While, explaining scenes and scenery, it came off as droll.<br />The characterisation was good and the events solid, yet the emotions drawn from heavyhitting fantasy writers was not there. The dialogue was delivered, yet with nothing amazing. As was the writing, it all came off slightly melancholy.. or shaded in grey.<br /><br />I love a dark and evil novel, which this was. Yet it was written with a somewhat downcast spirit in my mind. I gave it a 4, for being new and well delivered, if not exciting and read with bated breath.<br /><br />I'm interested to see how Abercrombie improves, he has all the right tools, falling short only in unique delivery, self coined dialogue and emotional intrigue.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really was impressed with the books. It was wonderful and full of juicy things to hold your attention. Would give it several thumbs if I had more.
1587143879|5.0|Cisco CCNA - Routing and Switching 200-120 Official Cert Library is the new addition to the Cisco press library to cover the latest CCNA exams announced and implemented recently. Wendell Odom is one of my favorite authors in Cisco Press publications. He is always detail oriented and covers the fundamentals very well. This new official Cert Guide Library covers the topics for ICND1 and ICND2 version 2 exams.  Cisco always brings changes in the curriculum to fit the need of current networking Market.  This package contains two books with DVDs. Cisco CCENT/CCNA book covers the fundamentals of networking (OSI Layers, IPv4 & IPv6 addressing, Routing and switching, IP services and Network management). CCNA Routing and switching book covers the actual implementation and troubleshooting of the above.  CCENT/CCNA book covers the basics of networking that anyone seeking employment at an entry level positions requires. This time they set the bar high by adding all the Routing and Switching elements of CCNA which was not covered in previous CCNA Libraries. CCENT/CCNA now has increased value than its previous version simply because the contents are more than just fundamentals of networking.<br /><br />I have seen lots of new stuff added in this book. Few of the topics are...<br /><br />IPv4 and IPv6 troubleshooting<br />Network Management<br />Router and Switch Security<br />IPsec VPN concepts<br />VPN, OSPF ipv6 and EIGRP ipv6<br />Software licensing<br />Managing IOS files<br />Syslog, SNMP, NETFLOW, DHCP etc.<br /><br />Implementation and Troubleshooting chapters in second book (ICND2) are specifically on IPv4 and IPv6 are critical to today's complex network environment. Author has done good job by focusing on troubleshooting.<br /><br />As usual the organization of chapters starts with Quiz and all important subtopics have been marked as \\"Key Topics\\". I like the way that is defined. It gives you a kind of importance to read it carefully.All the Figures are very clear and \\"Note\\" on important points are the key to anyone preparing for their certification.<br /><br />The DVD contains network simulator, practice questions and videos. I like the concept of \\"Mind Mapping\\". Mind Mapping is the concept by which you can remember all the aspects of a particular topic. It enhances your understanding of the topic and helps you remember and relate each and everything that the topic.<br /><br />Overall, nobody could have done better job in covering latest Cisco CCNA topics than Wendell Odom.  Explaining basic networking concept is an art. Wendell Odom has done an excellent job over the years.
0316044695|5.0|On this day, 06/28/2005, these men gave their lives. I finished this book last night. I could think of nothing else but the fact that these men will never know what they mean to us. Not that they would have ever asked in the first place. Our unsung heroes are still out there fighting. My heart aches for their families and for Marcus especially. No one can truly know the pain and suffering that this man went through with his brothers.<br /><br />As a Navy Veteran myself, the SEALs hold a special place in my heart. I served with them, met their families, and some of the best times of my life were hanging out with my boys, cutting it up. Some will point out the inaccuracies of this book and cut away at the fabric of \\"what it all means,\\" which is fine. We all have that little thing we call freedom of speech here in America but I will not do that.<br /><br />The reason this book gets five stars from me is because of my service, because there are men like Mikey, Axe, and Danny, willing to give their lives for you and me. Because of men like Marcus who lived through hell and willingly went back! We do not deserve the sacrifice these men gave us but they gave it willingly and would do it again and again if they could. And so would I.
B007THA4FI|2.0|There have only been 2 or 3 books in my life that I haven't finished reading and this is one of them.  Ii was very disappointed in the book.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|This story was breathtaking. The special effects were awesome. The cast was awesome. The ACTING was awesome. ANDY SERKIS... 1st Gollum, now Caesar He is the man! The story was so perfectly executed that it rivals most Oscar nominated stories. The Easter eggs laid out throughout the film are very amusing, and to everyone who has seen the film... When Caesar says &#34;NO!!&#34; you fully understand that the battle is on... I highly recommend to any one considering this movie, get it now, without hesitation. You will not be disappointed.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|After falling in love with Downton Abbey we decided to give this series a try.  The first season is only 3 episodes and I thought in the first 15 mins that it might not catch me as strongly as did Downton.  I was wrong - good story line and a fun watch.  This is a more relatable family than Downton in many ways.  I was dismayed when I started the second season this week to find that not all of the characters had returned and I felt the one character replacement that they did was a bit awkward - but all in all the second season is even better than the first.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game it makes time go by fast and it makes you want to eat fruit. it is good for all ages. it is for people ages 0+. amazing app
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It is a fun game, but only has 10 levels to start with. I'm still waiting for the update with more.
0786915749|5.0|I loved the movie and decided to read the book. You should know that the book is thousands of times better than the movie!<br />The book arrived early and on time. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy stories with mythical creatures and adventures. I gave the book a 5/5 stars because I was already completely head over heels in love with the movie. I was most definitely not disappointed by the book. I just ordered the other 2 books of the Chronicles trilogy. I really can't wait for them to arrive!
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|This show is incredible and Tatiana Maslany is an amazing actress. I tend to forget that I'm watching one woman play the 6  (or more??) different characters! It's well written and well cast! Definitely going to own this! Welcome to the Clone Club!
B003LL3LHO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It  filled out some areas in the game, (which itself is amazing.) I think anyone who enjoys fantasy will like it but will be more meaningful to gw2 players.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|A very entertaining movie with many fun and exciting scenes!<br />We will probably add this movie to our permanent collection!<br />Enjoy this one over and over again!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I am not rich, so I can't purchase gold-but, I think it is the best game EVER!!!!!!!!! I randomly bred my dragons, and then I hatched a wild dragon and named it Killer, now he is level 8. I have 3 lava dragons,1 water,1fruitful,1forest,1fire. I LOVE IT, GET IT NOW!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed book 1 and book 2 more than book 3. Drawn out at the end but still a ok read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I recently download this game and I'm never bored when I'm playing it. I recommend this game to people and kids who like horses!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows now - even though I never thought I'd like it! Definitely give it a try.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|its aight. but it gets boring after a while if all things arent unlocked. if your  looking for a hair salon game it sure aint this one.....
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|its so hard to find how to get from one place to another.  I give up and go to another game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Once you start reading you can't put it down!  The scene in the club was sizzling and a real page turner.  Way to go Sylvia Day!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It seemed like Sylvia Day wasn't quite sure how to end it so she just stopped writing.  Overall, I liked the book but wish it was a slightly more compelling ending.
B00C061I3K|4.0|I like it but i was expecting a different sound from this cd.<br />I would still recommend this to someone
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I loved this book and could not put it down.  The characters are great and so is the story line.
0812993845|1.0|I've read all of Sophie Kinsella's books (and most of her Madeleine Wickham titles, too). I liked some of the author's earlier works, but in my opinion, her writing has steadily gone downhill over the last few years. I did not care for her previous book, &#34;I've Got Your Number,&#34; but that one was a work of art compared to &#34;Wedding Night.&#34; In fact, I find it hard to believe that &#34;Wedding Night&#34; got published at all. The plot is just plain ludicrous--I didn't laugh once; the main characters resemble cartoon characters; and it's way too long (at 446 pages). A good editor could easily have cut the number of pages in half without the reader missing anything. I realize that you have to suspend belief with any of Ms. Kinsella's novels, but this one really crossed a line with me. Maybe I've just outgrown her style of writing, but I think this is probably the last book of hers that I will ever read.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Go Great fun for all! Easy to play with just the right amount of a challenge.  So hurry and get your flow moving!! You will not be able to stop.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|It took a couple of listens, but I love the record. His sound is so unique. It may not be easy to catch on the first time, but once your ears get used to the originality of the guitar sounds and song structure, the talent level of these musicians really shines through. BUY IT!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The book was sad and disturbing at times, but I really enjoyed it.<br />I guess reality is tough to stomach at times.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|This is a fun game.<br />I'm not good at these kind of games.  It is fast.  But, I've been improving!  I like that you can't die.  But, there is a time to beat.<br />You use your right or left thumb to navigate.  You crash into things.  It's just fun!  It has that red neck feel.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed the app. kept me interested and didn't run me off by being overly difficult. Would like see different difficulty levels created to enter into.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is one of those movies that I watch every time I come across it. Can't NOT watch it and it's as good every time. A hard movie in some ways but well-done. Even my 13 year old loves this movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|love playing this game very enjoyable no need to go out and play when you can play at home on bingo sites
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Love it.  Fun, upbeat, great lyrics.  Even okay to play around the kids...except for the first song.  Great album!!  Fun!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its a radical game but its hard to get investment points, which are really important to have! But overall its a radical game
B00881VLCE|3.0|After I first downloaded it and opened it. I thought it was messed up something was wrong. It never, EVER would open. Nothing do anything. I had the same issue with another app and was told to uninstall it then reinstall it from my cloud. I did and that one work. So I tried the same with this, a few times. Nothing!! I was going to contact for my money back I got on, clicked to open it...got a phone call. And back about 5 minutes later, AND THE PUZZLE MODE WAS ON THE SCREEN!!!???<br />So, I closed it...opened it again and sat and watched...about 2-3 minutes of waiting, the game clicked on.<br />SO...VERY SLOW TO OPEN and very hard to move pieces. This could be a great app but, it needs some work! I got it to do to relax, I have other games for other things. But, it is NOT relaxing to have to fight to move a puzzle piece please fix these issues and I will up my rating. Like I said, it just needs a few things worked out!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|its a great game very addictive cant leave it alone fun to  when I get on it play the I get right into the game
B007M45PMU|3.0|My favorites are Jack Johnson, Dave Matthews, Jason Mraz.  Love F.U.N.  This one didn't do much for me, only listen to a couple songs.
B005FMZVLQ|3.0|Ok, this is a nice watch for the price (with the discount of course), I like the look of it and the machinery seems ok, But.... The strap started to rip apart after 2-3 months! Insane. And it's decolored (black strap starting to look way too worn even though I'm not using it more than 3-4 days a week). Oh, one more thing, I haven't been able to find the original strap to replace it (at least I am not the kind of secret investigator to find the impossible online). For the strap, -2 stars.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this entire series. If you want to read 50 Shades, but don't want the Twilight undertone, read this spell binding novel. I can't wait for the next one. I salivate at the thought of it b
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Couldn't wait for this one counted the days...I think the author got lost and tried to hard to get another book out of thirds characters.  Should have closed the gap on situations and ended. I think the story lost it vigor and dragged on, missed the mark, but I live the characters  the plot just s little to weak
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I bought this after a recommendation from a friend.  Seemed like a lot to spend on a doll for my 2 year old but my friend was right...this is by far her favorite baby and she absolutely loves it. I've already bought a spare in case this one goes missing.
B000W453KQ|5.0|I think this is one of the best movies I ever saw. It doesn't loose it's appeal after seeing it more than once.
B00AKO93JK|3.0|Ok ever sense I've quit cross country I've never been able to get my abs back. So when this was free I went hay lets try this. I'm pleased to tell you I've got my abs back. But what I dislike about this app is the fact that when doing my daily 10 min an work back hurt and that was  conserning. There needs to be a grab x y and z before work out. I don't own a pair of dumbbells. (I do know some though). Some of the exercises I can't do because I'm not that felxable and I'd like more alternatives in the app.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Have read previous 2 books and looking forward to the next one. Could not put the book down and once finished re read the other 2 book again.
B000YXMMAO|5.0|'OK Computer' will always be heralded as there greatest accomplishment, but only because it came out in 1997.  Compared without the lense of time, in my opinion, 'In Rainbows' far overshadows it.  It has my favorite rock songs ('Bodysnatchers') the most beautiful of there ballads ('House of Cards') and the whole is tied together perfectly.  Far better than any single performance however, is the production on this album.  Never has such a diverse array of acoustic and electronic noises blended so organically- it drops my jaw every time.  And it translates amazingly well to vinyl.  Definitely get this LP.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Not just a love story like the note book, but a thriller too which I love! And the ending was shocking, it was a tear jerker :)
B00AIBZM40|5.0|His was a different kind of movie but I figured it out early on. Had a weird twist to it thought, worth seeing.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|The  Alfa AWUS036NHR - High-Gain 2000mw 2W 802.11 B/G/N Wireless USB Network exceed my expectations, it work very good and the supplier delivered it on time
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|It is so reductant.  Appears the author gavce no thoughts to what she was writing ; like a ruch to get the book finisted by the due date. So mnay issues unresolved.  Will ther be another sequence?  If so, I will not buy it.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|Thank God I was late and didn't pay the $30 for my daughter, her friend & I to see this in the theater! It looked like a great movie and I'm a movie lover of all kinds! I watch atleast 2 movies a night. But I watched it twice figuring maybe I just couldn't get into the first time...nope just a crappy movie.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|We would have given this 5 stars but dropping the &#34;F&#34; bomb a few times during the movie seemed really unnecessary.  Thought the acting was good and it kept us watching from start to finish.
B009RH9FR6|3.0|The material is very nice, however I hate to charge it as the charging portal is in the middle, not on the side so I can read it as I charge it. You have to keep it open when you charge it.
B008CRC506|5.0|The first season was so fabulous -- wonderful story, wonderful cast, terrific original music.  One of the most enjoyable experiences ever.  Too bad they couldn't follow through in season two.
0312570740|5.0|Very well written.  Entertaining and informative.  Easy to read biography with a good history background of the oil spot market beginning.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loving this, addictive fun to stretch your mind. Can't wait to enter/escape the next room. This app requires luck and logic and is a good workout for the brain.
B0082FPIY8|3.0|I have not finished the book as a got a bit bogged down in the details of the physical journey.  However, this is a good &#34;Jouney&#34; story of the spiritual and practical kind.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|I have not watch this movie yet for so many ahead of this one. But as sy-fi fan seeing how popular from reading reviews is great to explore that unknown movie clip. Hope to see you at the movies.
0307476073|5.0|Loved this book.  Cheryl Strayed tells the raw story of his life mishaps that lead to her decision to hike the PCT, then shares the stories of the hike.  Although moments in the book feel a bit repetitive, the overall story of her journey is a great read.<br /><br />A definite choice for those who enjoy travel stories, as well as readers who love transformational memoirs.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is awesome.But the reason I gave it four stars is because it gave money like I played it before
0425263924|5.0|so hard to put this book down! it was an amazing book! hard not to fall in love with the main characters
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This season series is spend at the farm. Unbelievable how popular this has grew from books, comic, movies, TV and merchandize collectable. Look at how many different Zombie you can think up and when do you move on. If you are into sy-fi  there is many different angle to figure out and take a bite of.
193700788X|2.0|It really is as if the author, tired of the fact that True Blood has completely changed the history and progression of her characters, just gave up on her own series.  This book is written like a book report that is due, but there was no inspiration, and so the author threw together some characters and plots from her notes without much effort and turned it in.  There is no emotional core to this novel at all.  Characters don't act like themselves - and even when their dialogue is something along the lines of what it might be, it's so void of any passion or purpose, it just falls flat.  The whole book really just falls flat.  And what a disappointment to fans who were hoping for a meaningful close to what was a really good series.  **SPOILER ALERT:  DO NOT READ FURTHER** Instead, you find out that Eric Northman is not the powerful vamp who found true love with Sookie and so was changing into a better (though still very self-serving) person/vamp, but rather just a superficial guy with a stereotypical girl type who he has \\"made\\" into vampires twice in the past (Karin, who comes out of nowhere, and Pam, who now apparently looks just like Sookie).  What a total cop-out.  If you don't want Sookie to end up with Eric, fine, but don't completely change the motivations of the character from the entire series.  It's like if you typed \\"but it was all a dream.\\"  LAME.  And having Sookie and Sam get together?  Whatever, but to do it as an afterthought in the final pages just to \\"wrap\\" things up is just stupid and meaningless.  I'm not joking, CH didn't even bother to write a love story or anything.  Sam ignores and avoids Sookie for most of the book, apparently because he made some stupid promise to Eric which magically goes away for no reason at the end, and then bam, they're having greasy sex in Sam's trailer and live happily ever after or some such crap.  It was so badly set up and written, it's not satisfying at all.  And then the big baddie revealed at the end is Claude?  Apparently, after protecting Sookie and closing all the Faeries off from humans, Niall just decides to let Claude go for the heck of it, knowing he'll probably attack Sookie.  Yeah, that makes perfect sense.  This book was phoned in for a final paycheck.  I'm just glad I checked it out from the library so I didn't waste my money.  I'll watch True Blood and see how they wrap things up with their Sookie universe.  It *has* to be better than this completely crap send-off.pparently, after protecting Sookie and closing all the Faeries off from humans, Niall just decides to let Claude go for the heck of it, knowing he'll probably attack Sookie.

630542828X|4.0|Good movie, had to use it for a college class I was taking. Hard movie to find in local stores, Amazon was the only place I could get it for a decent price in a reasonable amount of time.
B0095P3ULC|3.0|Okay, but story line is flawed.  Not too much to say.  One problem is that at times its hard to tell who is fighting who.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|PROMETHEUS is basically the 1953 science fiction trash classic CAT-WOMEN OF THE MOON, redone with a zillion dollar budget but with far less intelligence, wit and charm.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I highly recommend this app! Great effects, fun, and easy to use on pictures you take or ones that are already in your gallery.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|tweet what I want when I want I love it and no person can tell me different and follow all the people that I want
B004DM0UII|1.0|Keeps telling me that I need internet access then immediately exits. My 4G LTE connection is FINE. That, plus the stupid permissions mentioned, motivates me to uninstall and enjoy tune in pro, which also allows recording and has multiple timer settings.
B0050UEVU0|1.0|An openly authoritarian movie. The supposed hero of this film, along with his fellow cops, ignores the law, breaks into homes without warrants, abuses citizens, steals, murders... and I suppose the viewer is supposed to cheer him on.<br /><br />What a creepy theme for a film. The acting is excellent, the plot okay but quite thin, the action sometimes exciting.<br /><br />But thematically this is foul stuff indeed. It seems like the kind of movie they would show in Nazi Germany or fascist Italy. Or, I guess, Britain and America today.<br /><br />The cops shown here are so disgusting that one could argue that the true hero of this movie is actually the cop-killer, who is at least striking back against these thugs and the vicious police state they enforce.
B008SOS63S|4.0|We have heard him on TV and we weren't disappointed with the CD. Most of the songs were the ones we had heard and wanted. Enjoy it very much
1490313370|4.0|James Altucher is one of my favorite bloggers because of his quirky style. He tells painful stories from his past and writes about his lessons learned to survive. Some of his stories are so incredible they are hard to believe at times.  I mean, who in their right mind stands outside of Wall Street handing out chocolates? But then again, that's what I like about him. He focuses a lot on his \\"daily practice\\" which involves exercise, creativity and helping people (i.e. yoga, making lists, and introducing people). Another theme he explores heavily is the new economy and how we are all going to have to become more like entrepreneurs to succeed. Choose Yourself is very similar to his blog and that is maybe the biggest downside to this book. The book is largely a scattering of various blog posts. Some chapters are straight copy and paste jobs from his blog. I wish there was some more original content in his book for his fans. Overall though, I like this book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game a lot but as of last night I've been experiencing a bit of a problem. It's not with every pony I buy, but I bought Apple Cobbler last night and I got Lovestruck's house. And I bought Apple Fritter as well, and the house is still being built, but when I was trying to choose where to put the new house, it was showing up as Lyra's house. And I already have Lyra. So is there any way to fix this or am I gonna have to live with these screw ups and duplicates for the rest of the game? I am NOT restarting. I'm way too far in the game to do that.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|While reading this book you see all the small things add up and can end up being the reason someone hates life. Since reading it, I have became very careful with his I treat people knowing my actions could be the make our break point in their life. The book will anger you, frustrate you, sadden you, and completely tear you apart but at the same time hopefully it will cause a change in your everyday life style and open your eyes to the problems people are facing daily
B008M0NDOK|2.0|The controller is very jerky and when you have to hit a button you have to Press hard. I think its a okay. But it has its up and down depending on the person that is behind the controls.
B000002KIT|4.0|If Phil Lynott was still around he would still rock it our as he did this album. Excellent version of Rosalie/Cowgirl song makes this album stand out.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Trying to realize that we are as responsible for our health as anyone and we are killing ourselves eating Food Corporations processed and chemically and genetically altered foods. AMERICA WAKE UP. The bottom line is corporate greed and not nutrition and them making a dollar off the backs of the poor and the unwise propaganda they feed us. Healthy humbug. They have made people purposely addicted from everything from sodas to snacks, breads, and meats. It is a crime was is taking place in this country and especially at the expense of the poor.  Some children live in areas that have never seen a banana, tomato or fruit only fast foods. Simply horrifying!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have really enjoyed it so far, but wish there were more opportunities to gems because everything needs them... the graphics are great and as a horse lover I have enjoyed it a lot, even if the horse looks like it should be gaited when it trots lol
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have always enjoyed escape games. This one did a good job kept me interested. Had to look up the walkthrough for the 10th floor though, couldn't quite figure out how to get the key and needed help. Good job.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I needed something quick and easy! this is quick but not so easy however she gives you a level 1, 2 and 3 so I could start out slow and work my way into it which is perfect after having a baby!
B00A7OIXW6|4.0|My son is a toddler.  He has seen this movie one time, and it was months ago.  Still, he continually asks to watch this movie.  Apparently, it was memorable enough for him.  I enjoyed the movie, as well, and got a few laughs out of seeing some of the old familiar faces from video game history.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love the book, love the author, love the movie!  Romantic, sweet, cute!  Definitely a must read book, must see movie!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The puzzles are challenging, but not difficult.  As a puzzle lover, I appreciate the challenge.  There are no hints, so if you are looking for a cake walk I recommend a word search.
B004GYY714|5.0|i live on the reception cusp between two PBS and can get neither well. with tunein it doesn't matter, they both are crystal clear along with the Kathmandu and Dijon stations
0765357151|3.0|Cover disappointed me, but everything else is okay. Picture isn't the actual pic. Other than that everything was ok. .
B005MMY9A8|3.0|CGI was great; action was solid; even the acting was pretty good (a couple minor exceptions which I attribute mostly to the script).  The plot, however, is a disaster.  Now, I'm not familiar enough with the comic series to know whether it was the result of awful source material (i.e. the comics) or miserable script writing, but erudite this movie is not.  Makes Spider Man and Iron Man look like philosophical canon by comparison.<br /><br />That being said, it's still a fun film, with decent action and some interesting twists and turns.  Unfortunate the many positives and futuristic bent of this film had to be paired with a medieval ethos.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|It was neat how the family problems between father and son were resolved by while saving the world. The estranged family father and son discovered how much they were really like while working together. Very entertaining
1594200823|2.0|My dilemma was understanding this book.  It was very difficult to get into and I couldn't follow it easily so I gave up. It may just be me though. I wouldn't not recommend it because someone else may find it enlightening.  It wasn't expensive so I don't feel cheated.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I enjoy AccuWeather.  It is easy to navigate. I am surprised at the accuracy. The extended forecast is a broad range of days.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I downloaded this app and most of the time it crashes....not amused with this app.... then again the whole kindle is a disappointment
B00CWY76CC|4.0|There was enough challenge to keep me interested but not so much that I got frustrated. I look forward to new levels
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I started watching this season and couldn't wait to see the next one.  But at the same time, I wanted to savor each episode and make this season last!  I am definitely hooked!
0385349947|3.0|This is definitely a good read if you've never heard Sheryl Sandberg speak.  I felt much of the information in this book was simply exposition on the profound TED Talk she gave a little while ago so, if you do follow Sheryl closely, the book may be a bit of a let down.  That said, I hope the discussion does not end with Lean In and would look forward to reading another book by her if she chooses to go that route again.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|Didn't really like the way the book was set up... the ending wasn't so great and it was just a slow book to read. Not very emotional or anything. Just bunch of words together. Not ever going to let anyone I know waste time reading this book...
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another engaging heart warming and unforgettable effort from the gifted Hosseni. Lives and paths intertwine in effortless symphony of storytelling
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great pace and fun quests keep this game delivering excitement every time I have a chance to play. I recommend it highly!
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|This is my second favorite right after Ed Sheeran.Also the song Oblivion is such a lovely song to listen for girls like me.Song Writer/Singer Dan Smith was being cheeky in this song.I love the part where he sings the chorus &#34;Are you going to age with grace?Are you going to leave a path to trace?&#34;This song gets me every time.I believe a lot more people should know about this amazing artist.Bastille!!!!!!!!Especially with the lovely instrument he uses.Also to the fact that it comes with a lyric book.Which is important when you are a person that isn't good at remembering lyrics as well as others.So i like reading along with the booklet of lyrics.When i get a chance to.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy does it again with this thriller of a novel!  The intertwined military aspect with the technology of the cyber world is excellent reading.  The recent events in Asia, brings the reading to the forefront in this novel...
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids and my wife watched this, they  told me it was a great movie! They hoped that they could buy it permanently. I will be perchasing the movie soon. Thanks
B00355L2TU|5.0|This video is very effective and only 30 minutes...5 minute warm up 20 minute exercise and 5 minute cool down.  Definitely doable and it works!
B0063M22QO|5.0|my mother and I really love this game, but would like to be able to change the appearance of the tiles once in a while.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|...is AMAZING! She puts on a great show!! I could've done without the few usage of profanity (I hate when artist ruin their craft with nonsense like that), but the girl KILLS!!! Such a creative, energetic star!

B008XG1X18|5.0|Pintrest is a wonderful way to share others crafts, thoughts, information, creativity, home remedies, interest, diy projects, fantasies of beautiful far off places through pictures and stories shared of and about travels...
B004V5A7K8|4.0|can really get into this game to where I run out the battery on the kindle or am late feeding the pets
B004LWZW7E|1.0|Not at all what I expected. Justin Timberlake us usually good for an action packed movie and this was a little more low key.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Not a great movie but entertaining. Some action, some boring but worth seeing. Good cast and the acting was OK.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|Just when you think you've grasped the concept of &#34;thinking rich&#34; Secrets of the Millionaire Mind challenges you in a way that will convict your weak areas and whip your brain into the shape required to funnel wealth into your life. Positive with Raw honesty, no sugar coated nonsense here! I would recommend this book to a beginner looking for their way out the rat race and an even the greatest entrepreneur who may already have multiple millions. Regardless of you who are this book leaves no room for darkness in your mind and challenges you in extremely necessary much needed way.<br /><br />Don't just buy it...but several copies and share this NOW!!!
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a great book that taught me a lot about the history of cells that I didn't know along with a life story that touches your heart.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I really enjoyed the story and that this character god through moral issues, and is concerned with doing the right thing.  This is an adventure story, so there is a lot of action.  it is a very fast read and has a satisfying and happy ending.  I highly recommend this book if you are looking for an light read.  Enjoy.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|This was a boring moving. I will bet Phonix and Hoffman are sorry they starred in this film. I was boring.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am a huge fan of Riordan because his work never disappoints, and thus is the reason I have read all of his work
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Excellent in both story and cinematography.Relevant to today's world.Speilberg does a great job adapting Doris Kerns Goodwin's book to the big screen
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Only the real Kanye fans can truly appreciate this CD and what Kanye meant to do with it . End of story.
014312336X|5.0|Loved this book, couldn't put it down.  I learned so much about the history and culture of urban China at that time, and the story of the girl and her father, among the other players, is most intriguing.  Well written.
B00BMUVUZG|4.0|An inspiring narrative for the young generation  of aspiring activists so sorely needed to face the ever growing breed of greedy Politicians/Super-Rich nexus.
0739366408|4.0|The stories were fantastic and the narrators did an excellent job of creating a sense of realism among the interviews.  I was however dissapointed that it wasn't all the interviews that are in the printed book.  So for me this was an abridged version not complete as it should have been.  A quick listen at 6 hours. If you want a good story this is it.  I would however purchase the book as well
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best apps ever I recommend you to by it is so fun I hope they make a 2nd!!!  :)
B0042KZJR8|5.0|Michael gets better with every CD. A wonderful voice and the music is so reminiscent of music from days gone by. Keep up the good work Michael. Can't wait for your next CD since I have each one you have put out.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Couldn't wait till season 3 was available on Prime.  Excellent show - looking forward to season 4!  Wonderful cast of characters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the game cause it is fun and you can go to different places if you are on the tour
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's awesome I got the game in November because all my friends were playing it and I've loved it since:-)There is one glitch whenever you take down a door it produces 2 but it's still a really good game!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this app. has very interesting and creative challenges to open the doors to the next level.  great for puzzlers.  thank you
B003K07DUC|3.0|I wish I could say I really enjoyed it, but I can't .  No highlights in other characters. Leads people back to the fax machine.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|GET IT GET IT GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's all I haves to say. Ps this game should have a number 2.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love the movie! So funny can't wait for part 2!!! My favorite thing about the movie is of course the minions... There so cute!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love this case - more importantly my daughter loves this case.  the price is worth the piece of mind knowing that her new phone is now protected from the elements and herself!
B00AMBH70S|2.0|A very long and unexciting motorcycle chase does nothing for this movie.  It has little or no good moments.  Plot needs to have some more.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Not bad but I think it starts going fast too soon. What I don't like also is that things are too expensive, including people. Still a good game.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Feel the love, Bob Marley at his best, guaranteed to make you happy and mellow.  Don't worry bout a thing.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I had been curious about this show, but didn't want to watch it from new season. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon Prime during my free trial and I am HOOKED! The story is solid and the show is well acted and well directed. I recommend it highly, BUT only from the beginning. The streaming from Amazon was great and I prefer it over watching this on TNT.com
B00B5AP7NY|4.0|The Clark Kent figure is top ! The movie is good, my daughter like it. Enjoy the movie, for young & old people.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app because you can learn how to actually take care of a horse and how to feed a horse in real life. I hope you find this review helpful to you players of My Horse.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It's a fun game to just sit and play. Tilt control would be great to use, but it's relatively easy to figure out.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great continuation to the series. I am glad it didn't end but the next one needs to hurry up and come out!
B00C061I3K|5.0|Daft Punk never lost it - their music is always relevant and good. After hearing this one, I went back and listened to all of their old stuff, which is just as good as I remember. Delivery was on time.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Compelling story. I've been wanting to see the movie but I'm glad I read the book first. Hope the movie lives up to the book.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love it!  This is a great app for jigsaw people who can't have a puzzle sitting around.  It has different levels and can rotate pieces.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got to have like a real looking horse. And also it act's like one to and you can get more.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I found this book to be a mixed experience.  Some of the stories within the larger story are engaging and rich; but he moves on to others to tell a broader narrative.  I found this unsatisfying at times given that the smaller stories had so much potential.  The broader narrative loses its impact from so much moving around such that I lost the thread at various points.  It's a good read though and I like the richness of the tapestry he tries to weave even if it's theme(s) gets lost at times.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I love playing this game.  There is one or two glitches that are truly annoying and has prevented me from moving forward in the game.  At the beginning of world 3/4 Lep drops off the playing field before you can begin the level.  This also happens at the flag in, I think, world 3/3.  I'm stuck at level 3/4 and can not begin the level, not since levels are locked until you complete the previous level, I can't just skip this level and move on.  Up until that point, the game is entertaining and challenging.  I would give it a five star if I could continue my quest to complete all levels.
B003297I1U|5.0|Our son loves the toy and plays with it all the time. It encourages him to use his imagination and that is what great toys are for.
B007IK44CK|5.0|This movie had plenty of modern flare to it, but had just enough of the classic theme to balance it out.<br />I'll watch it over, and over, and over.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|I love this movie!  It has an ending that you never see coming.  Being in the field of domestic violence I really wish it would have shown a lot more accurately what domestic violence really is.  IT would have had to be x rated for violence had they done so.  I am still very grateful that this movie was made because it does address the problem of domestic violence in a broad arena!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Incredible ability to write in different voices, styles, eras. You think to yourself, he cant pull this off. Then he does.
B0034G4P80|5.0|My grandson is all about the Avengers, therefore he loved this movie.  We have already watched it several times,  he cannot wait for the new one!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|once you start this series of both the books and the TV show you are entered into a whole new world of &#34;a Game of Thrones&#34;. it is my favorite TV show currently.
B009NY43NY|1.0|An adequate foundation has not been layed to end with a Sookie / Sam HEA. And the peak we are presented? A lame roll in the hay and a two-stepping good time with fancy cowboy boots. Happily ever after with Mr. Safe? Cop out Ms. Harris. Glad you are moving on.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My kindle cache was frightfully full and had a bit of a problem figuring out how to clear out the memory.  After seeking help in the forums and through trial and error I figured it out.  Then I decided that there had to be an app to make it much more simple.  There is.  This one.  Easy to follow.  No muss no fuss.  It cleans your cache and as the cache starts to get cluttered up this app gives you a reminder to use it.  Not in an annoying way either.  Highly recommend!
1781162646|5.0|Ok, both my wife and I are long time King fans so what else would we say but &#34;we love it&#34;!? This new writing direction that the author has experimented with is one we would urge him to continue to enjoy--we sure did!
B000ICKPOQ|4.0|I've seen it before and will watch it again.  All StarGate programs are quite good<br /><br />Thanks for making it available.
B005DN7W4G|4.0|It took me quite a while to decide to purchase this video, as I had seen it several times on TV, and to a large degree, I was not especially impressed with it.  However, since I was finally able to put the film into the proper perspective and rate it objectively myself, I finally did buy it.<br /><br />Other raters have totally trashed the film because of its lack of \\"realism.\\"  Please!  This is a work of fiction and while it could have been better in several of the sub-plots - much better in a couple, the story line itself was quite good.  Recent space-related events have shown that this situation is not only possible and plausible, but somewhere in the future it is probable.<br /><br />I believe the most negative aspect of the film was, as several others have commented, was the casting of Tea Leoni, whose acting abilities are just - let us be kind here - \\"questionable.\\"  Yes, she is a doll and she tries, but even in the plot where her boss eventually sat her at the news anchor position, of all places, this just would not happen in the very competitive TV news business.  The ratings would hit rock bottom.<br /><br />The best part of the entire film was the incredibly touching \\"Goodbyes\\" enunciated by the astronauts who gave their lives for others.  Maybe I am too touched by such scenes, but they were very believable and superbly done.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Downloaded this to my kindle fire.  This is a pretty simple puzzle game but if you enjoy escape games it fun to kill time with.  I've had a good time fooling around with it.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|Fell in love with their upbeat country music that just sounded different. Had to buy their album after it became apparent that their music really was something I could relate to and something I didn't hear enough on the radio lol
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|I like it because it was educational and it seemed realistic / authentic to me.  Daniel Day-Lewis played the part well.
B00756GRUE|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase a higher priced watch such as this one via mail order but based on my positive experiences with previous purchases thru Amazon I did it. And I couldn't be more satisfied and pleased! Packaging and delivery was on time and flawless! The product itself is just beautiful and consistent with Seiko's high quality, durability, and attractive design.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun game I love to play. not too easy not too hard. I recommend to anyone who likes puzzle games. cant wait for updates.
0920236162|5.0|I wasn't looking for the book that was in perfect, spotless condition. I worry more about the price so that I can still save money while also having the product, but happy to see that the order is in a perfect, spotless condition!
B00BF123WG|5.0|I viewed the film more as educational because I don't know or understand much of how military assignments like that work.  It was suspenseful and definitely kept me interested throughout.  Sometimes at the edge of my seat.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|One of the best recent films:  action humor acting touching exciting.  Marvelous.  Once a graphic novel but a fine film.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|this was a really good game. it kept you guessing along the way.I would tell any one to get it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have always loved this game at the radiator festivals my kids live to<br />see how many blue chips to see what prizes I would get.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I thought it was a very good movie.  Offered a good look at the reality alcoholics face.  Denzel was great as always!
B001P06GX4|5.0|Was introduced to this game at Christmas. When my Aunt/Uncle were coming for a visit, i decided to buy it as a fun thing to do after dinner. It takes one game for people to understand how it works. Second game is always better. My boyfriend and I have played it each using 2 colors and really have fun with the strategy. If you're competitive, this is the game for you. Good thing too is that games aren't very long.
B004GYY714|5.0|I like how the favourites work<br />It makes listening life very easy so I will be staying with Tunein Radio
0553345834|4.0|Everyone wants to know what they teach at the exclusive Harvard Business School.  Mark brings to reality what fundamentals of business and management.

0120884674|5.0|This book is a must read/great resource for anyone studying physical anthropology. I thought it was easy to read and understand and it helped me out on many occasions. I still have it on my bookshelf.<br /><br />-Kris Noel<br />[[ASIN:098269718X Lionhead (Volume 1)]]<br />[[ASIN:1625530064 The Serenity Compound]]
B0090KZDSK|2.0|i'ts not that good and its start to be too long.<br />waiting for the and ... may be in the next book
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is seriously addicting. I feel like a investigator-- and its just hard enough, but not impossible. Very challenging and thought provoking!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|even when you advance to the next level the scenery makes it seem so repetitive. I still like to play it,  but a change of scenery would be nice
B005WYFLNU|5.0|My daughter loves to pull these books out on rainy days. She pulls the stickers all off and starts from scratch. She can clean it all up and put it away easily. She is 4 and its perfect
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Just enjoy . Don't think or worry about believability just enjoy. Fun, loud, over the top, and awesome! And if nothing else Scarlet Johanson in leather doesn't hurt.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|Congrats to Crystal Castles for this new, fresh and amazing sound! The band still hit with their lyrics and artworks!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This app is perfect for new magic players to get into the game with an easy to use tutorial and a fun laid back play style anyone can come into this app learn the game and okay like they know what to do
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Great series!! A must read. Can't put it down. Commit to reading this series & you will not be disappointed!!!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|Updated the app today (6/28/13)<br />And it no longer opens!!! Loads almost compleatly then crashes. Please fix this ASAP!! Worked fine until most recent update
B006YC74E8|4.0|I love this app &lt;3 It lets crop , write on it . It edits really good &amp; you can add another photo .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|if you like temple run you will love this game! I have never had anything like it! I play on it almost every day! :)
B008GOG98Y|5.0|One of the greats, if you like great character development, humor, and you will wish most movies were like this
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is the best of the series so far. Full of un expected events. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|It suffers only in comparison. I enjoyed it as much as the first one. Love Sid, and Scrat is a hoot. My gauge of a good movie is whether we end up watching it more than once, and we've watched it several times, at least.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have never been able to have my own horse but now I can! I highly recommend this game to horse lover's. The game is never blurry too. I love spending time with my horses. yes, you can have more than 1 horse! I also love going into competitions with my horses!
B00AY5B712|5.0|I had not seen this movie in a long time and I forgot how much I loved it. If I'm being totally honest though, I really purchased this movie to see Andrew Lincoln over and over again :)
B004G600A4|5.0|As a Disney movie, this one didn't stick around in theaters very long but has a great story and characters.  Teenage girls will see a lot of themselves in the part where Rapunzel finally gets out of her tower.
0812993292|2.0|A good study on the impact of choices we make and the things of our past and present we hide even from those we love. The ending left me a bit confused.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is one game that i would play all the time if it could get updates faster like on the ipod edition
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Once I pick it up I can't put It down. I enjoyed taking my time to collect coins and purchase new characters and boosts. I would play this game hour after hour. I really would recommend you try subway surfers.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|In a word: THRILLING!!  Never a dull moment - this show really keeps you on your toes!  I can't wait for season 2!!
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Loved the twists. Movie kept me watching. A must see flick. You will enjoy the drama of the final minutes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kids this is a great game<br />You need to play the game subway surfers<br />looking for fun play this game right now
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was a lot of fun.  Easy enough that my niece and I could play together, but still a challenge.  We got stumped a few times.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this book. I would read it again. I think people who love complicated love stories would really love these books.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this was fun wish there were more levels went through it to fast. challenging but not to the point you couldn't even win.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Bought this set as a gift, so I can't really say much about the packaging and all that.  As for the movies, I think most are great movies and definitely a classic series.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|It started good. Just that it seemed to get political. Also more importantly, animals don't have the lifestyle of people. They don't have musicians, towns with large buildings with large neon signs, and whiskey drinkers. Make the story in an animalsetting. It would have been better.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This is my new addiction since I can't play candy crash saga on my kindle fire hd. It's the next best thing.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|2nd book was just as good as first one.  Ken Follett has done a great job.  If you like something why do you have to submit a disertation on it?
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I've said this on a few other movies, and the same thing goes for this one.  I don't know what I could say about it that thousands others haven't already said.  Amazing movie, seriously
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I could not keep up with the sub plots in this movie.  There were so many that the whole plot got fuzzy.  I hated it and would recommend that you not rent it.
B004T32SOK|1.0|After installing, registering and verifying email the app only opens to the new registration page. Don't see any hope here.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I think the book was better than the movie.  Good story, but kind of depressing,  Glad I read it though.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Seriously though, I don't know if there's anything I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said by someone else.  Great ending to a great series.
B003QSMC18|5.0|I was born and raised in Louisiana and this movie was so cute and the accents were authentic sounding. Great storyline and I love the Creole princess.
B00DIXEZTI|3.0|This is a great idea.  I have not read the books, but I only saw The Silence of the Lambs which was excellent one of my favorite movies.  This could be a wealth of fascinating material the acting is good except Dr Childen whose character is completely over acted and really annoying.  Dr Lecter's character is sinister and oily I can't see what everyone finds so charming although that is good because all psych's are a little eccentric themselves( sorry for the generalization).  The reporter is annoying also,  she can get behind police lines speak and manipulate witnesses and get folks killed with impunity ( really!?) and contaminate crime scenes....for a blog.  Because I worked law emforcement some of the scenes are ridiculous ( nurse left alone with a max security inmate at night...nope not gonna happen not even in the most mickey mouse facility, witness left lone in an unsecured house and all the cops outside behind the barricades... come on) again annoying but some things. make up for it.  This could be a really excellent series hopefully it will get better.<br /><br />Update 7/24/13: I've read the book.  Now I can say the series pales in comparison, I also watched the movie, not good.  I've started reading Silence of the Lambs but because the movie looks to have covered it pretty well I got bored because I know the outcome.  The book was really good better than SOTL.
B006M4F67A|1.0|This application does not appear on my kindle. not passing. I have it registered in my account but is not installed on my kindle
0399160450|4.0|Better than a few of his previous works, but still feels somewhat phoned in compared to his early novels in the series.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Liked Tom Cruise in this movie, I thought it was well done and the action was superb,  I would watch it again.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I am a fan of the Hannibal movies, so I was pretty pumped for this new show. It starts a bit slow, but it did not disappoint. Mads Mikkelsen acts a different kind of Hannibal compared to Anthony Hopkins, more understated and less out of control, but it actually works better. You have to keep in mind that Hannibal now tries to blend in. Even so, Hannibal is completely scary and likable at the same time. His nemesis, the good guy psych profiler, is also impressive on his own and very likable. 10/10, probably the best drama on TV these days, if you're not pretentious about the subject and you don't mind seeing disturbing things.
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|This application does not appear on my kindle. not passing. I have it registered in my account but is not installed on my kindle
B001FB55MG|5.0|I love this movie- I think its actually one of the better Sandler movies out.  Just hard to find.  Russell Brand is hilarious!  Was surprised I ordered it Thursday night and it was delivered the following morning and that's with the free 2 day shipping.  My 2 boys think its a great movie and it promotes imagination :)
B0063IH60K|1.0|This game keeps flashing multiple ad screens or crashes my phone whenever I try to play. More frustrating than anything!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Can't say enough about it.  I liked SWYPE, but this is like SWYPE on steroids.  It has very good prediction capabilities also.  Like this one so much I bought the version for the tablet.  2 thumbs up!
B00459EZLW|5.0|I absolutely love this show and Eli is def. my favorite character.  I love the way this show tries to take a slightly more scientific look at things compared to how the old show, where they would basically just make things up to suit their needs.
B00CFA225Y|5.0|I have been looking for a good movie to watch for seemingly forever, and thankfully I took a chance on purchasing this film. I loved it, hubby came in to respond to my \\"Yikes\\" and \\"OMG's\\", and stayed to finish the film with me. Tonight we are planning on watching the entire film together. I thought the CGI was great, the plot fun, scary, at times yucky, yet true to the original storyline that I still remember from my childhood and I am hoping that the ending may lead to another film being made related to this one:)<br />Just lean back, and leave our everyday earth and enjoy scary times in fantasy land, we certainly did.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|In their entirety, I enjoyed all three books. However, I was not as emotionally invested in this one as I was the others.  There are a lot of characters in this book. Through each character`s perspective, we are given insight into years missing from the other characters missing narratives. Even so,it is precisely because  of these frequent point of view changes, that the reader can't really feel invested in any one character. As a matter of fact, it was quite confusing. When it wasn't confusing, it felt like,just when I wanted to know more about a character,the point of view changed again. Again, not his best book, but it was interesting in its own right. Buyer beware: this is NOT A Thousand Splendid Suns or The Kite Runner.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Mr Sanderson did what I did not think could be done and that is finish the Wheel of Time.  Having bought into this epic as paperbacks, granted...very large paperbacks...I am pleased with the resolution of this epic fantasy that I started reading so long ago...now the hard part is to put it down for a few years and enjoy re-reading it again...and I can't wait...because with this work, like Tolkien and some of the classic fantasy authors, it only gets better several times around.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|For mature audiences due to the language but overall an excellent story, excellent acting (main actors as well as supporting actors. Brings out the issue of depression in a way that is easily understood. Those actors surely deserved those oscar nominations and that win for Jennifer Lawrence was right on target! Well done!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I am in  8th grade but I really think this book would be for older kids for the causes of language and descriptions of kissing and sorts. But over all I really enjoyed this book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The third book was great. The story was very unpredictable. Cannot wait for the next book. The love scenes were hot too and what a story!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was the second time I read it and it's no less interesting. I enjoyed reading this second book as much as I did the first and I would definitely suggest it to friends
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Very interesting, action, suspense and funny too! I recomend it!!! Can wait to see the full 5 seasons!! Really like it!!
B000NY17J6|4.0|Great songs from a great country, pop, rock performer. I love country rock and Linda did sterling service to the genre in those heady early years.
1609419693|5.0|If you, for any reason, have to drive to Syracuse from Washington, D.C. - and back again - you have to listen to Tina Fey speak to you for as long as possible, preferably via this audiobook.  If you can get her to call you on the phone though, even better.<br /><br />Anyway, I actually hadn't heard good things about this book.  Blasphemy! I actually listened to it twice (it's short at just over 5 hours) on the way to and from Syracuse. Fey is so quick that I missed things the first time so a second listen was just as entertaining.  She is refreshingly honest, self aware, and hysterically funny all at the same time. Her past and how she got started is not that well known which I hadn't realized before and she will even tell you about that infamous facial scar!  Money well spent I tell you. My only issue is that she refers to \\"The PDF\\" several times which must contain pictures and I still can't find that (I downloaded it from ITunes).  I think most people, and by people in this case I mean women, will enjoy this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book is as good as the first two, if a tad bit more depressing. Again this is the second time I read it and at times I will admit I wanted to cry. I did cry my first reading, but that is because it was so good. READ IT
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A really fun game that shows what it is like to have a horse. I keep wanting to play and can't set my kindle down.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the best sci-fi books I have ever read. Great for people who love star wars or star trek
B00CWV8X04|3.0|I'm not sure why this movie got such amazing reviews.  It's good, don't get me wrong, but the beginning is slow and takes a while to draw you in.  There's a great plot twist at the end which I think is the only saving grace.
B00530FC6O|1.0|Silly, stupid inconsequential novel about people who are the same. I can't understand why the Brits so love these novels.
