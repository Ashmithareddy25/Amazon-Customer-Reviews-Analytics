B0072OFM28|5.0|I have been a fan of this show from the beginning and I am super glad that the story continues.  The visual effects are off the charts and the fight scenes are realistic!  This will be a superb addition to your Spartacus collection!!!  Highest recommendation possible!!!!
034580404X|5.0|I was told to read these boos.. and i am glad that i did.. I Loved them, couldnt put them down!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the characters, the writing, the scenery, the interiors, the clothing, the wit and the drama of Downton Abbey.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game really is quite fun and addicting. My only issue is when the app fails to load a battle or a 'friend' in the game and it forces you out of the app entirely. Gets annoying but doesn't happen often. Very enjoyable.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book is definitely in thirds. The middle third was the exciting part, the first and last thirds were just ok. Too much hype so I was expecting more.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|excellent game the only thing that I would change is the amount of time it takes to replenish ur energy and how much it costs to buy a new horse
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed these books. Couldn't put them down. There were some things that are a bit far fetched but its still a good book and a great story line.
B000IDGDPA|5.0|Again I rewiew only to refute the negative reviews which are pointless. This is a very well made movie with an excellent story no matter what other movie may have a similar theme. An excellent love story and visually perfect. See it! There are bad movies made and we might have to suffer those but a movie of this quality does not deserve negative feedback. I think people who give great movies bad reviews should be stuck in an elevator watching \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" over and over again for the rest of their lives w/o any other form of entertainment.
B005COO1X6|4.0|This was an interesting and kind of spooky short story. Very fast read but worth the short time to read. I recommend
B008K8X0IS|5.0|The package was great and included a teaser for following season. The dragon egg was a plus and conversation piece.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a good story about spontaneity vs planning. For a change the woman wants to dictate when she'll have a child and the husband gets to go through all of her in decisions with her. The trial marriage was an unexpected twist. What man would agree to that?
B002BWP49C|5.0|I liked the books so I figured I would like the movies, the books are far more organized but the movies are ok too
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I installed this, played it twice, and it quit working. Then I deleted and reinstalled it the next day. Worked once, then the graphics went all crazy. Loved playing it, even though I only got to 3 times.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I love Channing!  The movie itself was stupid, I don't like the story line they provided but watching Channing dance and strip down is amazing :)
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|If you like the show you will love this!  A great mix of songs from the different characters in the show
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I liked the books so I figured I would like the movies.  The books are a little more organized and detail oriented but the movies are good.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have enjoyed all of vince flynn's books using mitch rapp as a super cia master mind.  I like the way it starts out and continues all the way through which made for exciting reading.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Excellent quality recording of a phenomenal show.  Had heard it was a good show, but we couldn't wait to see each episode.
0393316041|4.0|Richard Feynman's account of his own life portrays him as a fun-loving person and a good story-teller. Never shy to expose and explain his (analytical) thoughts and feelings, it gives great insight in to his 'thinking machinery'. The chapters of his work on the Manhattan project (in Los Alamos) probably have some historical relevance, although is account is mostly about how he entertained himself cracking the safes of his colleagues.<br />There are no really controversial or unexpected revelations in the book. It is an easy read about a succesful life of a man with a love for physics, practical jokes, art, music and  women.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Amazing picture, almost to good. You can see the green screen overlay at times in Episode I but it was made with early CPG so it's not like anyone was suprised to see that.
1481251880|5.0|I choose this book based on the amount of reviews and didn't read what the story was about. So when I got started I was so engrossed with this book thinking it was gonna be a cute romance book..it was SOOOO much more than that! Dean Holder was ah....amazing!! Loved the was the story was introduced and how it developed and intertwined into something so much bigger than expected. You won't be disappointed in this book!!
B001TH16DI|5.0|Best way to watch the Star Trek movies. Amazing quality watched the movies on VHS and DVD but this is the way it was ment to be.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Most amazing book I have ever read. Like it just makes you want to cry for her, it is touching and I'm speechless. You can't put the book down when you start
B006RXQBUC|3.0|The acting was very good in this movie.  I enjoyed it.  I learned some U.S. history that I'm been unaware of until now.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very interesting book. I loved it. Couldn't stop reading it. Much better than the movie. It is a true page turner.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Quite well done.  Good story and the bonus story brings things to a nice closure.  Definitely recommend.  Only problem I experienced was because of fat fingers.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is seductive and juicy. Loved every second of it. I can hardly wait to read the final installment.
B00127RAJY|5.0|How can this not be good?  It is Jillian Michaels.  She is a master at motivating and keeping you on track.  There is a lot of fitness media available but I say stick with someone that you like and that has a high success rate  You can't go wrong with Jillian.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK. It was written in a way that was completely believable and worked through emotions that everyone can relate to.
0345529057|4.0|I have read the first two books so far and love the story, but am shocked at how low quality the bindings are. They are falling apart. I can't lend, sell or even reread them they are so damaged. I have never seen books fall apart so quickly
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|really enjoyable<br /><br />like the idea that a person is able to use the game to just relax yet beat my own time
0765325950|3.0|As a long time reader of this series, I was disappointed in the final book. I will give a few spoilers here, so, for fans that have not read the final book, please stop reading. First, there were too many battle details. While I personally like reading about battle tactics, and personally enjoy reading about wars; reading 600 pages of sending troops to cover the left flank, the right flank, and to cover the heights is a bit too much. I have to admit; in the first 2/3's of the book; I was getting bored. In most of this series; Jordan was a master of building plot lines; and then building the battle scenes to a crescendo in the last two or so chapters of his books. This book started with battle, and the plot lines developed near the end. In my opinion, the ending kind of stank as well. Rand had plenty of adventures. He had lovers, and babes to deal with; why send him off at the end to adventure more? Loved reading the series, but the end was a bit disappointing.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|it was a great movie, I wish cat woman would of had a little bit of a bigger part MEOW BABY!
B0041EVYVK|5.0|The lead singer has a deep strong voice,brought emotion to her voice I loved it very soulful you could feel it
B0034DGPEU|3.0|This book had too many characters.  It did not compare with The Help. The style of writing was fine, though..
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Anticipating book 3! Wish I didn't have to wait till May! What a great series so far. Definitely unexpected but glad I started reading them.
1465001107|5.0|Purchased the calendar for my niece for Christmas. She is a big Michael Jackson fan and she loves the calendar.
161701091X|5.0|Waited a long time for this to arrive and it was worth it!! Just love it. Will save it forever.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This, the first of the Maze Runner Trilogy, was a well written, finely crafted story.  It grabbed my interest early on and gradually unfolded into an intricate, fascinating and fun to read tale.  Of course the author leaves you with a cliff hanger so you are drawn into the next installment of the series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is the best book I have read recently.  The characters are well developed without getting boringly descriptive and there are enough twists and turns to keep you absorbed in the book.  It is dark but she lightens it up with a bit of humor and with the pure kindness and strength of the characters.  I highly recommend Hopeless.
B004JN1CW4|2.0|This, the concluding edition of the Maze Runner Trilogy, was a huge disappointment.  After reading the first 2 books of the series, I expected more and was left wondering what happened.  It was almost as if someone else had written it (or there was a rush to meet a publishing deadline).  The story felt choppy with many fighting / action scenes thrown in that seemed to go on forever solely for the purpose of taking up space.  The majority of the other portions of the story lacked depth and were unrealistic (even for this genre...) with the characters presenting as shallow compared to their presence in the first story.<br />I had an overwhelming desire to rewrite it myself in order to have some quality closure to the series.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Even as an adult I could relate to the characters. It also took place close to the time I was in high school and that really drove the story home. You want to root for these guys, make sure that they're going to be ok. It gets you thinking how they will be when they grow up and then in turn you compare that to yourself. But yeah, lol, it gets ya! :)
1584233494|5.0|Great book covering the entire life work of fairey. From album covers, to skateboard decks to his legendary street art. Great value for money!
B000FC130E|5.0|This was my first Neil Gaiman book, I just hadn't found the time. And how sad am I that it took so long. This was fantabulous!!!! I was enchanted by the story. Gaiman sucks you in and doesn't let go. The characters were well developed and the plot had twists and turns. It made no sense but then it made absolute sense at the same time. If you love fantasy, fairytales, unlikely heros and epic storys then you should definitely read this book!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|love love love this game! great plot; always looking for next clue; exciting and addicting! can't wait for the next phase!
B000059MEL|3.0|I love Daft Punk. I love Discovery. I love Vinyl.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after receiving my copy of this record, I found a rather unpleasant click/pop that occurred at the beginning of Aerodynamic. This click consistently happened at each revolution and could be heard in the quieter parts of Aerodynamic and the beginning of Digital Love. I exchanged my first copy for another copy. Unfortunately, the same clicking occurred in the same spots. I troubleshooted my Turntable with many other records, including Side B of the one producing the problem. Every other record is fine.<br /><br />I don't know if there was just a bad run of this Vinyl, but be careful when you order it. I'm not saying it'll happen to you, but perhaps consider buying it used or from a local store where.<br /><br />To clarify, I borrowed my friend's copy of Discovery and the clicking/popping did not occur as in my two copies!

B009P5S11G|5.0|There are Rihanna's new songs that I love. Again different style from Rihanna from previous album which makes me well for changing life. I think the best songs of the album are Diamonds ,Stay ,Jump , Right Now and Numb. I love all songs from album all of them are beautiful. Of course songs depend on Rihanna style for that it makes more happy to Rihanna lovers.
B00000EK9D|5.0|I bought Weird Scenes Inside The Gold Mine back in 1983 when it was still being sold in stores.  This double album was released in 1972.  It contains so many classic Doors songs and also some then-previously unreleased songs.  This is a rare double \\"best of\\" album that should be in any purists' collection of Doors albums.  I highly recommend it if you can find a rare copy.  I still have mine and it's in \\"mint\\" condition.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a very challenging and addictive game. Very fun to play and the graphics are great!!! You gotta try this.

B00A8SPNYW|4.0|There are tons of puzzle games but this 1 has set itself apart with mazes and puzzles combined. after learning through the first few rounds it really picks up with of the obstacles thats are placed in your way. Moving in reverse was a great move by the developers!! I recommend this game, [...]
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It works great.  When I plug my kindle fire in, it tells me it is charging and how long it will be.  It also shows me basically when I am using the most battery.  I like it!!!!

B0047SF41G|4.0|better than predator 2.  not quite as good as alien versus predator.  the original is still hard to beat.  I recommend to someone who liked alien vs predator.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I believe in heaven and  and don't need it confirmed by another book. I do want to read, but he saw and how it affected him. I feel that anybody that has had this type of experience changes their life forever. I am one of those people, I had an experience with the Blessed Virgin Mary 1976 that changed my life forever, in a heartbeat.
B0086700CM|3.0|While the website indicates that the application is compatible with my phone, [LG Englighten], it sadly isn't. Temple Run is a fun game to play, though I have found that it is very rarely compatible with my devices. Any work done on making this compatible for a wider range of devices would be very beneficial and appreciated.
B00746O3X8|5.0|I purchased a spider holster and found it too cumbersome. When I like about this Holster is that I can attach online to my holster that will prevent me from dropping the camera on the floor. I find it lighter and with the camera sitting in the center of my chest much easier to access. I would recommend this Holster  to any photographer that has to carry two cameras

B001DEXDNI|4.0|Annie has a great voice!  In this collection she sings some of her hits and some hits that others have made popular.  However, my very favorite song on this CD is 'Shining Light' which is a new addition.  It is up beat and fun!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I was loving the game. I just downloaded this game game yesterday and was playing all day. Now today was a different story. While I was playing it started to force close now it won't even load up for I can play.

0671042858|4.0|Trisha McFarland is a nine year old who is going hiking with her mom and older brother. As the hike begins, the mom and teenage brother are busy arguing once again and Trisha who is walking behind them, decides to veer off and use the bathroom in the woods. She figures she won't be missed and she even hopes that her mom and brother might look back and be scared once they realize she's gone, since they've been paying her no mind.<br /><br />Once she's done using the bathroom, Trisha decides to take a shortcut through the woods, instead of going back to the trail. Within minutes, she's completely lost. Her brother and mom still haven't even realized she's not walking behind them anymore.<br /><br />\\"Trisha turned back toward the slope, and then turned around again as the worst idea of her life came to her. This idea was to go forward instead of backtracking to the Kezar Notch trail. The paths had forked in a Y; she would simply walk across the gap and rejoin the main trail. Piece of cake. There was no change of getting lost, because she could hear the voices of the other hikers so clearly. There was really no chance of getting lost at all.\\"<br /> p.21<br /><br />Days roll into nights and the deeper she walks into the woods, the worse it is for her. Soon enough, Trisha realizes she is not alone, something is following her. She can't see it, but she knows it's there. This 'something' is leaving dead animal carcasses and claw marks on trees. Trisha's poor sense of direction continues to lead her further and further into the deep woods.<br /><br />Do you know what amazes me most about this book? The fact that Stephen King can write a story about a nine year old girl being lost in the woods and turn it into a tense, creepy, page turner. I decided to re-read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon one weekend and it was a nice dose of horror.<br /><br />Characterization is wonderful here as per King's usual. Trisha's parents are divorced, while in the woods she has flashbacks of her mom and dad. She wonders how she could have been sitting in her car one minute, and lost in the woods the next. You can't help but root for her and be scared for her too. King doesn't miss a beat though, Trisha hallucinates at times as the exhaustion and stress take their toll on her. As I read I could easily envision the dense woods, the sounds of birds, the fear Trisha felt.<br /><br />You don't really know what is following Trisha, whether it's a bear or a monster.  King does a fantastic job at making you scared of something that hasn't even shown itself yet. It's simply the thought of that monster in the woods that is really scary.<br /><br />\\"The unreliable moonlight had changed the shapes of the trees, had turned them into bone faces with black eyes. The sound of two branches rubbing together became the clotted croon of a monster. Trisha turned in a clumsy circle, trying to look everywhere at once, her eyes rolling in her muddy face.\\"<br /> p.98<br /><br />I recommend The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon to all King fans or to anyone looking for a quick dose of horror. This one is mild compared to his other works, so if you are new to this author and are looking to read one of his books that isn't too scary, I think this is a good choice.<br /><br />The fear of the unknown, inner strength, courage and hope are what lies at the core of this scary story. King delivers here and I'm glad I re-read this one. King has a knack for creating young characters that the reader can root for and care about.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />This review is my honest opinion. I did not receive any type of compensation for reading and reviewing this book. While I receive free books from publishers and authors, I am under no obligation to write a positive review.

B004KKXUOE|5.0|The late, great Jane Austen was famous for her keen observations of life, love and the foibles of people involved in both and for her ability to gently make fun of them. For me, Sense and Sensibility is another classic and classy example of this master at work. While not as complex to read as something like Shakespeare, the formal language and speech of the nineteenth century is more subtle and difficult for many modern readers, it's not a fluffy beach book.  I think it does the modern-day reader good to read a story that requires one to slow down and savor the words and the subtleties of interactions as well written by a great author. This is your chance.<br />Read the book and then watch a movie version- such as the one with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet.  You could do the same for Pride and Prejudice, but for that movie version I highly recommend the A&E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. My family loves to compare and contrast the movie version with the original book. 9 times out of 10 the book wins!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this app to see how it was. A lot of the animal care games are either boring or monotonous.  This game, so far, is neither. You get to do many different activities, from training, to animal care, to shows. You can purchase diamonds to buy better things for your horse but so far the game has been pretty generous with handing them out. If you like animal care games, horses, or are just looking for an easy, no thought involved time waster, this game would be it. And I want to mention the graphics are some of the best Ive come across on a kindle fire game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK I CRIED WHEN KATIE READ THE LETTER!!!!!!!!!! I LOVED it. IT also had so much emotion

B00AHXIC50|3.0|For his 2nd cd, Bruno did alright. He's a great talent. Songs like Natalie & When I Was Your Man shows off his array of talent. Show Me gives us that Caribbean  vibe we so loved from him when he introduced it to us by way of Liquor Store Blues via his 1st album. But this album didn't grab me like his debut album. All in all, it's decent.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Killing Floor:<br /><br />A little slow moving the beginning but then picks up steam to become a typical, exciting, suspenseful Jack Reacher novel.  Lee Child is a very creative Mystery/Suspense writer.

B00004VVNB|2.0|For those who cut Logan's Run slack by saying it is a product of its time, allow me to point out that only three years later, Star Wars burst onto the scene, and 2001: A Space Odyssey came a full eight years before!  Although it is clear that a lot of effort was put into the production, even as it steals from Metropolis and gives to the video game Myst, in the end, the unrelenting cheesiness cannot be overcome. This could have been a great film,  but its chance for greatness was beyond the ken of those who created it.
B00881VLCE|3.0|the pictures are cute but I got bored after doing a few.I will not play too often but every now and then.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is a fun time-waster which I only play while I am watching a TV show that I don't really need to pay attention to.  I did notice that although the pig characters change, the set-ups on some levels are very similar.  It is frustrating when I can't get past one set-up and can't go on to the next - but that's the point of the game!

B00992CF6W|5.0|My nine year old son says this is a cool game. We are still trying to figure out how to join a game with his friend who has a PC-version, but he still enjoys playing. It is not clear how to download other skins for his player, so we are checking the other comments. It is hard to get him off my Kindle so I can read my books.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One if the best books I've ever read!! Highly recommend!! It is more than a love story.....it's about survival and hope!
B008JOK59K|3.0|After six months, I believe I've given this album more than a fair chance to grow on me. But alas, it just hasn't.<br /><br />As a Jersey boy, I love these guys dearly. I have pulled for this band all along since they started opening shows for the Bouncing Souls. 59 Sound and Sink or Swim are two of the most sincere albums I've ever heard. But Handwritten, at best, is bloated, mediocre arena rock.<br /><br />Now, '45' is a great song - maybe one of their best - and a terrific, albeit falsely promising, opener. The down-tempo assortment of tunes that follows is akin to the music that I grew up trying to avoid. Lyrically, the songs are still beautifully crafted, and there are a couple stand-out tunes (Howl, Desire) but musically, the band has taken an obvious detour down the commercially-accessible corridor. I personally like my music more on the upbeat side (imagine how great 'Mae' would be if they picked up the pace a tad) but I am mature enough to appreciate when a band slows it down. But this album is slow and trudging to the point of being bland. I mean, if I wanted a Tom Petty album, I'd go buy one. And the change in their audience reflects this: I went to go see them live a couple months ago and was surprised at A) the amount of people who didn't know any of their older songs and B) the amount of people you'd be more likely to encounter at a Kelly Clarkson concert. The show, on the whole, was a boring let down, replete with candles on the stage for \\"ambiance.\\" I don't mean to harsh on these guys, but please.<br /><br />I am giving this 3 stars because like I said there are a few (IMHO) decent songs on this album. Furthermore, I won't let my personal tastes deter people from buying an album that is still better that 95% of the crap that's out there these days. But more so, I am being nice because it's the Gaslight Anthem and I'd feel a sense of betrayal if I didn't honor how much this band has meant to me in the past. I only hope that next time around they can return to their roots a bit and stop kissing ass to Bruce.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|Wonderful true story of the struggle to end slavery in Brittan, and the surprising turn of events that finally brought it about.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Gotta play to win and I just hit the Literary Lottery with HOPELESS by Colleen Hoover. What an emotional roller coaster ride. Fair warning~~you'll need tissues. You'll need a cold shower. You might even need anger management classes. You'll also laugh. See what I mean? Roller coaster. I expected a love story and got more than I bargained for. Sky and Holder are starting their senior year of High School. To this point Sky has been homeschooled by her adoptive Mom who completely resists social technology. No cell phone. No internet. No TV. No TV!!! Thank goodness for Sky's best friend Six who not only shares some technology but also shares her bad reputation by association. This of course makes public school a bit of a nightmare. To make matters worse~~Six begins her senior year as a foreign exchange student leaving Sky to find a new Very Best Friend in the Whole Wide World. That would be Breckin. He's Mormon and wears pink shoes. (Read it~~you'll get it.) Holder, now there's a character. Completely misunderstood. The relationship that grows between Sky and Holder is beautifully written. There is a passion between them that will leave you breathless~~and they hadn't even kissed yet. Hold on. Remember, we're on a roller coaster. The story takes you to some very dark and uncomfortable places. There is some foreshadowing of Sky's life before her \\"Mom\\" adopts her that tells the story of why Sky is Sky. You will find hope in HOPELESS.
B0090SI4HO|5.0|This is the most fun I have had in a theater in a long time. Arnold is back and kicks major ass while his supporting cast is hilarious. Can't wait to get the blu-ray so I can have the extras.

B004QIG7CW|5.0|I gave this to the daughter of a friend. She is seven years old.  It has been her favorite movie for over a year.  She loves to sing and dance and acts right along with the movie.  The message is about having a &#34;can do&#34; attitude. Also fun and entertaining.<br />A good gift choice for any budding young entertainers in your life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i really liked it... but it freezed up sometimes! other than that it is good! I recommend it! I good time consuming thing for kids or anyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of my absolute, all time favorite shows! You'll want to have a Downton Abbey weekend blitz and watch all three seasons once you watch just one episode.

The other sounds are authentic but I'm so happy to have the purr!!! :-)
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really enjoy this game although I wish the energy lasted longer. I like looking for the objects and trying to beat the time.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|My 5-yr old and I both enjoy playing this game. The Free version has a lot of levels to play and a lot of variety - there are different kinds of Monsters on different levels - Red, Purple, Green, that do different things. When a new type is introduced into the game, there is a short clip showing how to use that kind in the game (similar to Angry Birds). Some of the levels do get quite difficult and take a while to figure it out. But overall, it is a fun game that can be simple and entertaining.
B001NLKT60|5.0|There are about 40-50 pages on the front end that could have been consolidated, but overall enjoyable read in the trilogy.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|A REMINDER of personal responsibilities and not to rely on excuses when we fail ourselves or others. Well written. Highly recommended.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thought this was a great read. I didn't want it to end. I wanted more. I would like to read another.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|A little different than the other hog games but I am enjoying it so far. Asks for review a bit early though, and not sure what the full version will cost.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Only rating so I can play rest of game. Only rating so I can play rest of game. Only rating so I can play rest of game.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I had read the book previous to watching this and although I enjoyed the book more I believe they have done a good job in relating the content with the television series. It's always difficult to capture everything that a book has to offer with a screen adaptation but HBO certainly made every effort to stay true to the content and I am sure I will be purchasing season 2 when it becomes available.
0061537969|5.0|Do yourself a favor, and put \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" by Garth Stein on your reading list. It is a unique literary novel with a philosophical dog, Enzo, as the Point of View character.  I know, I know, there are plenty of books with a dog as the protagonist. But this book is so different and so memorable. \\"Racing\\" pulls together the metaphor of automobile racing with a tail (pun intended) of familial love during adversity, the dog's belief in reincarnation, his love of TV, crazy humor, deep pathos, a couple of evil twins (and an evil zebra), all capped off by a perfect ending. You'll be thinking about this book for a long time.  A must-read.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I had this item in my cart for some time before the seller finally canceled my order due to lack of stock. I was pretty bummed out but I really wanted this item. A few weeks later I decided to try again, despite it being out of stock. The seller did not have it for a while but them suddenly I was charged for it. The item shipped shortly after and I now have it. Now the item availability has changed again to temporarily out of stock. I can't help but feel like someone pulled a string for me. THANK YOU. This knife is so badass I am glad I bought it. Killer deal for a quality blade. I am in love with it and recommend getting one (or two) if they are ever in stock again. Nice balance and feels like an extension of my hand when I hold it.
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|This was a fast and entertaining read.  Didn't want to put it down.  It lost one star because the writing style is rather pedestrian and I doubt the book will leave me with a lasting impression.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|it is a great app I would sujest it too eny parents who have little girls that love too play
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so cool I love it so much and I love my horse and the games are fun and so is the copotitions
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was nit expecting that ending. Great book. Definitely worth the purchase :) I am excited to read the last book!
B005LAII80|5.0|Forget all about Sylvester Stallone's film. Please, just forget about it. Never mention it again. This is a more genuine attempt to bring the character to life and Karl Urban really nails it. I truly believe that's Judge Dredd I'm watching, filmed as he goes about a 'normal' day in Mega City 1. And what a day for rookie Judge Anderson to have her assessment! Good performances all round and the film scores for not out-staying its welcome. It has its faults for sure, mostly due to the modest budget but I like the overall aesthetic of a more grounded, run down future (why would they have flying cars after a nuclear war anyway?) It is also incrediby violent, a throwback to the 80's action films (especially Robocop - partially based on Judge Dredd). Add to that subtle satire, strong female characters (there's a good case for calling this movie 'Anderson'), several genuine laughs and a stonking soundtrack and you have a pretty damn good film.<br /><br />The DVD is one of those few times it matches the blu-ray because of the intentional 'grain' used in some scenes, keeping that overall 'documentary' vibe. I did have some problems with the blu-ray (as mentioned elsewhere) but I swapped players and it was fine. The colours during the slo-mo scenes are very vivid though, so the blu-ray just edges it (strange how Amazon only allows one review, as DVD and blu-ray are completely different beasts). Extras are short and sweet, undoubtedly these could have been better but there's a quick beginner's guide to Dredd's comic history for those only familiar with the character because of 'the other film'. Overall, a solid re-introduction to the character and the world of Mega City One. It's a real shame a sequel is highly unlikely to get made, as this setting opens up so many possibilities, not to mention classic Dredd stories to explore.<br /><br />3.5 stars if it were any other film, 4 stars because it's Dredd (long term fan). But as some people have only given it 1 star because they 'didn't like it', I'll give it 5 for the opposite reason.
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome game making graphics could be better but I'm glad u created it.ur the best make more games for me.!!!!!!!!!

B00447G29S|4.0|First 3D movie we watched.  Since I have verigo, wasn't sure if it would effect me. NO SIDE EFFECTS. Would have been 5 stars,but geared to children but for our first it wasn't bad. Just good wholesome movie to be enjoyed by the whold family.

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|Based on what I had heard about this movie, I expected to be rolling on the ground laughing.  This never happened, not to say I did not laugh though.  Lots of vulgar humor, which is popular today, and many times I enjoy it just as much as others.  However, this fell rather short of my expectations.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Great movies and story line. Continue to watch and rewatch this movie. Theme of life is always a adventure is very enlightening.
B00493E1GI|5.0|Fantastic movie! Bravo Julia... fits me like a glove (without money though)lol<br />Its uplifting to see there are others going thru this... enough that it required a movie!
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|Watch and rewatch frequently. Always good to see and learn about the adventures of Oscar. Very educational and informational regarding chimpanzees.
0307887448|5.0|Ready Player One is the first novel in a long time that kept me up past my bedtime so that I could finish those last 75 pages. The book, written by Ernest Cline, is a fun and meaningful futuristic romp through 80s nostalgia, mixed in with high-stakes adventure, teen angst, and a dash of Plato's Allegory of the Cave.<br /><br />The book follows Wade Watts, a seventeen-year-old boy in 2044. In this semi-dystopic future, there exists something called OASIS--a virtual reality that has something for everyone. Kids can don their visors and gloves and log into OASIS to go to school. People go to their jobs by logging onto the OASIS servers. The economy in the virtual world is more meaningful and more stable than the real world's. The virtual reality system even has its own political structure.<br /><br />When the creator of OASIS, James Halliday, dies, he leaves behind no heirs. Instead, he creates a competition to find an \\"easter egg\\" hidden within the OASIS system. The first player to find the hidden treasure inherits all of Halliday's wealth. This action, of course, leads to thousands upon thousands of people to become egg hunters or \\"gunters.\\" Wade Watts is one of these people, and he has good reason to be. He's an orphan living in the \\"stacks\\" (literally an area where mobile homes, RVs, and double-wides are stacked on top of one another to save space). He uses OASIS as an escape from the real world.<br /><br />The search for the egg involves riddles and clues from James Halliday's childhood and his favorite era--the 80s. References to John Hughes movies, arcade games, and cassette driven computers abound. It even includes one of the favorite bad guy tropes of all time--the evil corporation, but nothing about the book seems contrived or forced.<br /><br />Even if you're not a child of the 80s, the story is well written enough to draw in even those who aren't 80s buffs. Ready Player One is tons of fun and contains a lot of heart.<br /><br />(from loebick.com)
B002RI9UBS|2.0|I personally have found this book hard to get into and in fact gave up after about 35% as it was just about animals- lots of facts and points of interest- but boring, then a whole lot about religions- again facts and points of interest but again boring.... I have heard others rave about the book and then about the movie but frankly I did not see it. If I wanted to learn about animals and religion I would research it and not expect to read about it in a &#34;novel&#34;
B00013F35I|5.0|Bruce is the Boss.  What a great concert.  He just doesnt stop.  Gotta love the boss man.  Will watch alot.

B00AYB0TOW|1.0|this was a horrible movie.I had enjoyed the original with Mr.Stallone. It was corny and kitshy. This version was so bloody and violent. No redeeming qualities. Just plain yucky.
B004132HZS|5.0|Sherlock is by far one of the most entertaining shows to ever cross television. As an advent fan of Dr Who, I was ecstatic to see two of my favorite writers taking on the project of modernizing London's most famous sleuth, and the results do not disappoint. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman were a golden pairing as Sherlock and Watson, their performances unmatched by any other duo to take on the roles (yes, that most definitely includes the most recent Robert Downy Jr. and Jude Law). And to follow up the performances of its cast is the superb writing, that bounces and breezes along at such a breakneck pace you may be gasping to keep up at times, delivering many laughs and occasional surprises along the way. The only disappointment, there's only three episodes. But, at an hour and a half and episode that keeps up the wit and the fun, as much as we'd love to see more, the ultimate experience is just too satisfying to fuss, and it's easily worth the purchase.
B004QX07G4|4.0|well done  funny , sounds like  her voice.This is too much rambling at times but overall a goo d and funny read.
B004QOB8SO|4.0|Sherlock is one of the most witty, intelligent, and ferociously entertaining series to ever flaunt itself on television, and it's near impossible not to fall in love with due to its fantastically developed characters, breakneck pacing, knockout performances, and its undeniable hilarity. Season 2 is almost every bit as good as Season 1. Out of its three hour and a half episodes, Hound of the Baskervilles is the only one I have a few minor complaints about. As entertaining as the episode is from start to finish, it seems a little \\"beside the point.\\" While all 5 of the 6 episodes throughout the series are building up to a bigger picture, Hound of the Baskervilles seems to veer our direction for a while, sort of as a distraction, while adding a minimal amount to the master plot, which is unveiled with the final (sometimes mind blowing) episode. Even with that note in mind, the series as a whole is too unique, and too brilliant to pass up for any reason.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Thrilling every thing comes together at the end. It is not quite the ending you expect but it gives you a new perspective and love for the characters.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is a good example of why TV these days becoming superior to film. It's a fantastic show and it's nice to actually own the first season on disc.
B005LAII3U|5.0|Wonderfully creative remake of the original...  and much better than the original...  I would recommend it to action and sci-fi buffs.

B0032O6S4I|4.0|THE MAGNIFICENT! My daugther, 4, is entranced in this make-believe-animal world for hours. As a parent, I enjoy hearing her scenarios from the next room and playing together with her at times too.  It is her favorite quiet-time activity. We have had it for 2 months.<br />THE PRACTICAL! I considered skipping Playmobil and building up a bigger Legos collection instead. I am so glad I didn't. She can work all the Playmobil parts herself. There is a lot of frustration with some of the cool, but harder to manipulate Legos at this age. Setting up the zoo took a bit of time (1 hour, 2 adults), but not bad.<br />The DEFORMED ELEPHANT :(  The elephant initially looked big and magestic. Unfortunately, the poor guy has a crummy ear design that allows them to be snapped off forever. This first break occured within the first week. When I examined it afterward, I could see it didn't stand a chance; small, tight hinge in head relative to a giant, inflexable ear.  My design revision would be to put a snap-in hinge like one similar to the Playmobil hand, albeit bigger. This way the ear would have give, snap off, but could be reattached. We have had no problems with the other animals.<br />Conclusion: Sad Elephant aside, this is a great set!
B0064W652A|5.0|This is a comic anyone can pick up and enjoy. The story is AMAZING and the art is absolutely killer. My hat is off to the writers and artists. Thanks for a great read!!!!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun, but I don't like the ads popping up like that I think that it is stupid so if you do it differently it would be a lot better, as I said fun special if you love horse's, I play it every day but really you should do something about the ads popping up because I hate that it drives me nuts you should keep them in one place and not popping up in people's faces all the time.

B00B47NO2O|5.0|This is a powerful show, not for the weak of heart. Kevin Bacon does a masterful job, and the plot is absolutely insidious. Don't watch if you don't want to get hooked.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|Norah Jones's voice is --- well, consistently Norah's.  It has that smokey feel and emotional quality.  Are there better Jazz singers?  Probably.  But Norah Jones gets full emotional value from the songs.  It's mellow, tuneful, and easy to hum/sing-along with.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|You have to spend over $20 to get use of Microsoft excel, word, and PowerPoint files with most fonts, but for me this is worth it. The functionality is good. The interface is adequate.

B001EBV0OY|5.0|This movie is fantastic!  It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over again.  That fact alone falls into a category of very few such movies.  This movie is based on the book by the great author Stephen King.  After viewing you will not be disappointed!!!!

B0099Y2MYK|3.0|I just purchased the UK version of Seasons 1 & 2 and enjoyed the acting, costumes, plot, character development etc.  What bothered me is that the 8th episode of Season 2, a very critical episode, was not part of the UK version.  And the Christmas episode came on a DVD that was damaged and needed to be returned. The damage aside, I was very disappointed not to have the 8th episode and after spending the money to purchase these 2 seasons had to make additional purchases to see the episodes that were omitted. I have already pre-ordered the 3rd Season which will be available on Jan 29th and am second guessing whether this was a wise decision as I'm concerned there will also be missing episodes. I would caution anyone purchasing the UK version not to do so, but rather to wait until some US version comes along.  That last episode of Season 2 and the Christmas episode really brought the season full circle and set the stage for Season 3.
B00499QUK2|5.0|While it maybe over killed soon enough I think the reinvention was perfect for modern day and I hope season 3 start off good

0547848412|5.0|The movie was first time it followed the book closely. In fact I enjoyed the movie equally as much as the movie. glad I rad the book first..
B000092T6M|4.0|Since a few have written reviews addressing poor Blu-Ray quality it should be noted that this is not a Blu-Ray disk and therefore should not be compared to that quality. That said, the DVD is a low res 480p and therefore grainy when played on a digital TV, but still quite watchable (unlike a VHS tape which isn't worth watching on a digital TV). The extended version is delightful in the additional footage and includes a surprising critical revelation of relationships that was unknown previously. There is much more to watch of Alan Rickman in his delicious portrayal of the Sheriff of Nottingham. This story version of the classic tale is ever a delight, no matter how many times one sees it. The special features with the \\"vintage\\" cast interviews are nothing special as they are more or less without energy or enthusiasm and conducted as promotional appearances with typical 'silly' reporter questions. No revelations here and once you have seen them you won't likely be tempted to watch again. If you are upgrading from a VHS tape, as I was, this is a worthy purchase for the extended film footage alone.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|WOW! I have the...wait for it...FEVER!!! Great story...I wanted to scream at the book...I wanted to hug the darn thing (passion...right)! As far as finales go...this one is one of the best. I never am completely satisfied with series endings, but I gotta say this was one wild and crazy ride with closure. Loved the flow of the story and where it took me. I'm not gonna lie...I was ticked at times but things are not always what they seem and that's what made this series so riveting. There are a lot of players...tons of lies and deception. Who's good...who's evil??? It's so hard to tell and I LOVED!!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|this app is one of the best I've purchased. I use it pretty much every day. would definitely recommend to others
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Perfect characters!! I read this book in one day! An absolute must read! It was so good! Couldn't put it down!!!!
B008X9Z37A|4.0|I love black in anything and this is a rich deep black case that holds the Fire snugly and securly.  It has the magnetic closure and a rich smooth texure.  It is simple and understated yet elegant.  Sometimes after all the bright colors and styles that scream \\"look at me\\", I crave something simple, basic and classic, and this case fits that mindset.  No frills black--businesslike and elegant.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Everyone with a vivid imagination will enjoy reading this. At times it got to unbelievable but that was intended by the author
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|it's completely awesomer than pirates of the carribean.very awesome.so cool. very.cool. so so so so cool.awesome so so so so cool.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love bingo and this version is something I play every other day.  I'm glad it's free and I get to have fun.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this app is terrific! It has always been right on with the weather outside and I can depend on it to keep me up to date on the weather for future days
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Good app for people who need background noise to sleep.  Lots of base noises without the need to buy more.<br />It has a timer to turn off and an alarm, plus a night clock that you can dim. True some of the noises are on an<br />obvious loop and some are to not what i would think to be a &#34;go to sleep noise&#34;, but the good really out weighs the<br />bad.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Loved every single page, I will say however it is predictable but good nevertheless and anyone will enjoy the book
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|I thought the graphics were crisp and the action good both in building and in auto play. The winning graphics are fun. Good job
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow. This kept me fully engrossed. This took me through so many emotions, it messed with my mind but I loved it! I felt this showed exactly what happens when a relationship that starts off with so much passion begins to deteriorate. I wish it had ended differently, maybe with a little bit of justice for everyone, but it didn't. All in all, a great read!
B003LAUBAK|4.0|Good and the sound quality is quite good for a live performance. Will probably order more music in the near future.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love the variety of sounds, I use a different one depending on the time to get the baby to stay asleep and it is so peaceful. He sleeps longer which is amazing. very pleased.
1476715904|4.0|This is my second book by this author..and I think I read them way to close together. My emotions can not take reading her third book (sequel to this one) I was pulled in from the start and couldnt step away from finishing this book. Dont get me wrong I will read the third one I just need to take some time away. Colleen Hoover did an excellent job giving the characters depth and even if you didnt like what they were doing it was still worth continuing on.
B008BU70HW|5.0|Loved every single page and the back story it provides, If you love Downton Abby as I do, will really enjoy the book...I can hardly put it down!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Funny, sad, romantic. Quick has a great writing style that really lets the reader fill in the blanks and visualize the story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game even my 15month old enjoys playing this game. excellent for the horse crazy person. great way to spend some down time when you cant go to the barn.
B004HD61KE|4.0|This was one of those books that you think about when you're not reading it.  Playing around with the story, trying to figure out where the author is heading.  Chewing on the facts.  By the way, kudos for the research and the way fact and fiction are woven together.<br />This was my first Sigma Force novel so of course I now need to read the rest.  Overall I really enjoyed reading this book.  I think you will too.
B006O2QNOU|2.0|LONG, SLOW Movie. BIG Name Cast. ANGST laden plot. Lots of HEAVY PORTENT. Heavy handed morality play that basically put this viewer to sleep.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|every time I get a new high score and try to save myself it freezes and exits the game!!! I'm soooo pissed right now!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game! If you like to play solitaire, you will like playing it electronically! Warning: Can be addicting! I seem to play it a lot while waiting in doctor's offices, etc!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are great. It's a lot of fun and constantly giving you something to do. I would definitely recommend it for horse lovers.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I like to pass time some evenings playing games and Spider Solitaire is a pretty good one.  It is easy to catch on to and a nice variation of the game.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|I babysit an adorable little girl who LOVES Tinkerbell and this movie was great - even I got roped into it! Storyline was cute, the DVD was in perfect condition a win-win all in all
B003O86FMW|5.0|I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK. IT KEPT MY ATTENTION. I LIKED THE DETAIL OF THE STORY. IT WAS I OF BEST I'VE READ.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|its a time flyer gamer. but in the lite version its so minimum. but fun. when you are bored just click on this app and time flys.
B008TTPQXA|4.0|Interesting details of the NDE hypothesis.  Clearly a deep personal experience.<br />However, I feel that comparisons with the NDE literature could have been explored further.<br />Fascinating story
B005P06AAO|5.0|I is a realy good show for teens but I just the way jenna gets in all these situations.I just wish they would stop using OMG and othrs aginst the Lord . I cant wait for  the 3rd seasonto come out.I realy would like to meet the castsomeday.
B0086700CM|4.0|this as really fun game! I love the other temple run too! they both take my spot as my favorite game.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down!  I throughly enjoyed ever minute of it!  N!icholas Sparks one of my favorite writers!  I can not wait to see the movie.  I intend to read it again before the release.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I always die early... I suck xD I cant get to the mine cart level/part! who has? let me know!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|this is an excellent movie.  The whole while i was watching it, i could help but feel so old.  I remember the star of this movie as the little smart mouthed kid from 3rd rock from the sun... not look at him
B00594XOZU|4.0|this is a good texting app for people who can't get I message. I love it!!!! So please try to get this app.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought it was way better than the movie! Very creative writing and very vivid descriptions. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVED THIS STORY AS WELL AS THE FIRST ONES. I THINK THE AUTHOR HAS A WAY OF TELLING A STORY THAT YOU CAN SEE.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great fun game with vivid and interactive grafics. it has a very realistinc feel. this game is good for any age to
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Brilliantly written·A wonderful story of young infinite love…a great insight into another side of living with cancer, a must read!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|i avoided this movie because i didn't know i would like it.  Home with my daughter, i finally decided to watch it.  It's a good movie and i'm afraid that i love it.  I watched it twice.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought the book was very good. Keeps you guessing. I think that people young and old will like it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i really enjoy playing this game not only can you have fun,  but its also teaching you how to take care of an actual horse.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is one of the most outstanding books I have read in a long time wow from begging to end.  I gave this book a 5 Star because of how well it is written.  What I most loved about this book is how everyone in it comes together and the storyline comes together wow.  I would recommend this book to all family and friends who like this kind of book these are just my opinions and you really need to read it for yourself wow outstanding writing thanks
B004QK5N5W|2.0|I purchased this thinking it would work for my i pad which is the original one but it doesn't. Luckily, I have a newer version but I wanted to use the old one for my classroom to connect this to my projector.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is a great one to get. I enjoy all of the reading plans. It really helps you to have a better time with God.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|Not because it is a shallow remake of a remake... but because it simply sucks.  Johnny Depp is good but in all honest- when they don't have him doing a &#34;Captain Jack&#34; impression of whatever character he is playing- he's decent.  He knows how to poke fun at himself and how to be completely silly.  and that is all there needs to be side about it... avoid- if possible.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|F2f twitchy f2f huff. Cc uhh tv tv gttdg tv hi ibn g f2f chugging f2f by h cc th ghcv
B0096DZKZC|1.0|also have the kindle fire and cant get this game to download. waste of money. been trying for a week.
B002APU580|5.0|This was a movie I streamed. I liked everything but the fact that there was not closed captioning so couldn't catch everything they said.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|My rating is based on my having listened to the white noise in an awake-state.  I have not used it yet as a sleep aid.  The sounds are realistic (but who can sleep with the sound of a dripping faucet?!) and most seem to  be soothing.
B009RH973I|5.0|I really love this case!!!! My kindle fit snugly into it, I really love the magnetic closure. It is not big and bulky, it is very slim. I like the texture on the out side makes it easier to grip, not as likely to drop it. I ordered the wrong case the first time,<br />I hated it. Sent it back and got the right one !!!!<br />Amazon refunded my money on the first one<br />I ordered and let me send it back at no charge.<br />Thank you amazon !!!! I am very satisfied !!!!
B009GEAPYW|4.0|I'm a big fan of Adma West's version of batman but the gritty... dark batman is wonderful.  All of them- and seeing bruce get old and how he still feels like he wants to brawl is how you expect batman to end up
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My opinion is that  this game is really cool it's fun I play it very day that's how much I love it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved the book. It made me laugh, worry and cry. A roller coaster of feelings that once i started reading i couldn't put it down until the end... and it was so inspiring that I had to read it again...<br />Hazel and August, the main characters of this love story, are teenagers so real that I think any kid could relate to.<br />I haven't read any other book of John Green, but now I want to read them all. I hope they are as good as this one.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|The movie was soo funny but i was alittle sad that they didnt have some of things in the movie thay theu had in the previews.... overall the movie was great and i loved it
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Beautiful book. I love it! Once  I started reading couldn't stop it was literally addicting! A real heart warming story
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so much fun for a free app. i have nothing bad to say love it!! i see why it has 4 1/2 stars!!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Colin Farrell looks better as a secret agent than his muscle bound counterpart but this movie lacks the comic charm of that one.  I knwo the story is different but as a fan of the 1st, you wait to see if there are any similarities... over few.  I will say that the tech used in this movie is awesome... that's about it... sorry kiddos
1439152802|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's books, and I was disappointed with The Distant Hours, but I appreciated the effort.  She is back on top with this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book. Could not put it down.  Lots of twists and turns.  A real page turner.  And surprising. Enjoyed.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|WOW, what a wonderful jewel to come across (just like what takes place in the film).  I came across this title by accident surfing a movie channels selections and was intrigued by the synopsis.  What emerged was a beautiful film of coping with loss and the way every bit of life that people touch within their stay on this plain effects time through the ages up to the present.  Writer/Director Julian Fellowes 'FROM TIME TO TIME'-2008 approaches its subject from the point of view of its main character brilliantly played by Alex Etel and we the audience are introduced and experience each clue as the story progresses.  You've read about the story and characters in the reviews within so its great to discuss the production by Luciana Arrighi and the cinematography by Alan Almond which bounces you back and forth from 1809 to 1940 with the greatest of ease.  The performances are outstanding by all including a villainous take by Dominic West , absolutely shattering characters portrayed by Dame Maggie Smith and Pauline Collins plus a surprise appearance by Timothy Spall.  The transfer is in a 1.85 ratio with subtitles if needed and includes a feature called Cast and Crew Interviews with main actors (not Dame Maggie Smith, unfortunately) and behind the scenes filmmaking.  A trailer for the film rounds out the special features.  It contains so much heart and soul that it must be experienced rather than talked about and it has become one of my favorite films of all time.  Click the add to cart button and enjoy a story which includes time travel, ghosts, and incredible sentimentality taking place at the end of World War II in Britain all during the Christmas holiday.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|good game but the lag is TERRIBLE and the fact that when I try to use a gem it completely closes out the game pisses me off. doesn't count a single coin I got but it sure counts the stupid gem I tried to use. good game, just dissapointing that it force closes by itself and the lags.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This is my favourite contemporary YA for sure. The characters are wonderful. The story has just enough drama. I could read it again and again and recommend it to anyone that's looking for a nice, easy read.
B0017P520U|3.0|the animation is wonderful.  you will be able to see delicate details on the characters faces.  the monest look scary and for all my guys out there- there is blood... ohhh sweet blood... and the acting is great wuglif is incredible
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I used to read the comics here and there and this is a truer representation of Judge Dredd. Sylvester Stallone's version just can't stand up to this, it's such a substantial improvement over what he starred in.<br />Here's hoping for a sequel or two. By the way, I had it on a 24 hour rental, watched it twice then ordered the Blu Ray. That's how good this is.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The competitor loading takes forever in the tournaments. Wish I could change my horses name. Fun game, simple t follow.
B00992CF6W|5.0|We love this game!  My son is Autistic and it keeps his attention!  I'm glad we purchased this game.  I wish there were more like it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I struggle with facebook. It's OK but there are times when it get s a bit much. I don't go there each day and the e-mails from them telling me I'm missing stuff are a bit of a pain. But it does help me keep in touch with my kids and grandkids.
B006O99S8G|5.0|Seriously love anything that Stephanie Perkins writes. So good. Such a great story. I finished reading it a few months ago and am still in mourning!
B00APUQT7I|3.0|put this on when the kids came over to spend the night- it's a good movie... and if you have seen the series- then you will know what's in store.  Others- a band of various animals form a herd of friendship and live together... welcome to kid movies... while i do have to admit- history buffs will be outraged... parents will be happy

I am always blown away with how good this movie looks.  When i have friends who come over and have never really seen much as far as 3D TV, i pop this in and let it play.  It never fails to amaze every time.
1594487154|5.0|Get ready to broaden your perspective.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because selling is a much broader concept than you likely think.<br /><br />About 1 in 9 Americans earn their living in traditional sales -trying to persuade others to buy products or services. If you fall in this category, reading this book is a no-brainer.<br /><br />The perspective broadening comes in here...the other 8/9 of us spend a majority of our life trying to move people to give us something (attention, affirmation, effort, resources).<br /><br />We all are in some form of sales.  This is an inherent part of our human experience. We need each other. The way we connect and exchange - giving and receiving -- on a daily basis has a profound impact on the quality of our outcomes (and incomes!) and the quality of our lives.<br /><br />If you think this is cool, reading this book is a no-brainer. Jump into this oasis of social psychological research, stories, and applications and your inner geek will be dancing. This very well may become your new favorite book.<br /><br />If the idea of being in sales brings a flavor of distaste to your mouth, reading this book is a no-brainer. How's that? Dan takes this perspective head on and his approach will draw you in and guide you forward in understanding the nature of your distaste and how to embrace this reality. You will find an engaging, entertaining read by an author who is adept at translating social science research into understandable findings and actionable takeaways.<br /><br />To Sell is Human currently is the most highlighted book I have on my bookshelf. One section that particularly grabbed my attention is what Dan calls Buoyancy (in his discussion of shifting the conversation from A-B-C of Always-Be-Closing to Attunement-Buoyancy-Clarity).<br /><br />In my world, Buoyancy - how to stay afloat on an ocean of rejection - is resiliency. This detailed discussion of the research behind coping with and growing through adversity is an important one for any student of human potential.<br /><br />Think I covered all the bases to say...reading this book is a non-brainer.<br /><br />(In a spirit of transparency, want to disclose that I received a free advance copy of this book. It came with no expectation that I'd write a positive review. I gladly will be paying this comp copy forward by gifting several copies of To Sell is Human to others).<br /><br />Mollie Marti, JD, PhD<br />Author of \\"Walking with Justice\\"or any student of human potential.<br /><br />Think I covered all the bases to say...reading this book is a non-brainer.<br /><br />(In a spirit of transparency, want to disclose that I received a free advance copy of this book.

B001EN71CW|5.0|If you enjoyed the series on TV you will love Firefly on Blu-ray.  The picture detail is outstanding, simply amazing for a television show.  I look forward to watching the series over and over, I love it!
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|This movie has a good plot.  The story is not as engaging but if you are lookign for something for the kids to watch with their friends- it's ok... as long ast they are not scared of zombies- lol
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the new temple run.. The graphics and new options are awesome..<br />Playing on Samsung galaxy s3..Its fast too....<br />I think I am addicted
B005LAII08|4.0|I like all of Pixars films. Though this is not my favorite one, i bought this specifically to add this movie into my Disney collection, but more specifically, to my 3D movie collection.  The movie is great to watch in 3D. Great music, good story.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is amazing. I like this book because it is funny and entertaining. I would recommend this book to everyone who has the whole entire book series. It connects to the other books.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have enjoyed this program more than anything I've ever had. Even my local library. Loads of free books, easy access, and easy to use.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I am glad that I read the book and still have not seen the movie. But from the trailers, it seems that the book is better. I think both Pat and Tiffany are flawed and even damaged in some sense, yet good people at the core. The fact that they have relationships with people around them, who care for them, is the real silver lining in the plot. Especially Pat has a tremendous support network around him, and everything that happens around him and to him is textbook therapy. Working out, rooting for the Eagles, meeting new people in the process, finding a great therapist, not having any addictions, faith and hope – they are the perfect ingredients for his road to recovery. Similarly, Tiffany has her dance routine, running, and Pat to help her along the way. Their suffering is real and the reader can relate to some of it (at times all of it), but not everyone gets as lucky as Pat and Tiffany with such supporting people surrounding them. Pat does not have a job and so he is not living a regular life. It would be a huge challenge for him to go on and find a job and eventually leave the parents’ basement. It’s a feel-good book dealing with very serious and very real issues. If you have a loved one in a crisis like Pat, this book provides an overview of the environment that needs to be created for them to start getting better.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|bane makes this movie.  If you talk to anyone who has seen it. they will agree. I have always hated the way Batman talks... seriously just drill some nostril holes in the mask.  And trust me, i know bane is not taht far from it... but he's great in this movie.  I was lookign for the old vemn injection system, but having a bad mofo was a good decision
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I highly suggests this game to anyone looking to kill some time. If you liked the first &quot;Temple Run&quot; game you will love this! I give it five stars. See what you think! Also check out other &quot;Imangi Studios&quot; projects. You may be interested in some of the other apps they developed!<br /><br />Joe, New York app center-
B005DOJ68K|5.0|This band is before my generation but I was hooked by my father who had a copy of CCR on his reel-to-reel player.  The fact that all the best songs are on one album makes this a great album to listen to anytime. Now i get to share great music with my father who is amazed at how i now stream the music on demand via the Amazon MP3 android app from my phone.
B005OCFGTO|1.0|Discs were found to be defective in that they froze/skipped/returned to previously viewed sections.  This occurred in multiple areas.  I ordered this collection in hopes the good price was a reflection of the bare-bones presentation.  I'm afraid it is probably more a reflection of inferior production sources ie. &#34;knocked off in a garage somewhere&#34;.  In reading reviews of this item &#34;collection&#34;  problems had been noted as described above ...THEY ARE REAL AND EVIDENTLY ONGOING!  I was in hopes Amazon had taken note and action to  correct the problem with their suppliers.  A call was placed to a live person at Amazon to make them aware of this issue and hopefully get them to effect action when there is a pattern of defectiveness reported as is the case with this item.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I tried several different versions of apps like this one but this is the only one that does just what it says and is the easiest to use.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I purchased this for my grandchildren but to my dismay, it frightened them.  I think the animation is amazing and it is a kind-of interesting story-line. Sometimes I feel like witches curses are over used in stories. But in the end, the heroine learns a lesson and that is what is important.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I watched this three times.  Even though it's fictional- if you apply the logic... this movie is follows cause and event as honestly.  The acting is decent... Ted is honest and it's actually a sweet flim with the except of all the filth-lol but as a guy- it's great
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Good game.  Nothing like the first two games of the series,  but it is fun and fast paced.  The four class s are fun to play.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought that when they made brave tumble run that it was the best and now they prove me wrong. Get this app it's amazing
0765325950|5.0|Loved this book!  Brandon Sanderson did an amazing job finishing the series.  Almost the whole book is climax, since the previous two were building up to it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Exceeded my expectations for knowing about the weather and what to expect where I am traveling to. Motorcycles can be a wet experience and this program really keeps me in the loop for all weather.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow! What a page turner. I really enjoyed this series, I am not all the way done with the last book. I hope there will be more of Ana & Christain.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I had to read this book for a class and loved it!!! I got the free Audible version too and the narration was wonderful!!!
B0017IKR7K|4.0|Sweet music...like all his other cd's he's made this is nice to listen to. I highly recommend buying this cd.
B0056CUZRA|4.0|Fall of Giants is a well constructed and written novel. It gave me a good insight into the insanity of the European aristocracy and their attitude to their fellow citizens.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I am addicted to this game. Should put it down and get more sleep at night but I can't! :) Love the graphics on this one.
1451695195|5.0|My daughter had heard him speak once and I received the book as a gift. After reading it I was convinced that who God is and What the afterlife is going to be is very much in line with my brother's experience with a NDE. Great read as well -
B00APUQH0W|3.0|I rate three stars because watching Eastwood is always an experience.  The movie is best at relating the tension between father and daughter working through the struggles and issues that life, family, experience and relationship often bring.  The theme and backdrop of baseball is great, but it lacks depth and breadth in developing the theme.  But it was still enjoyable, with good characters and interesting insights into baseball.  I'd recommend it but it might let you down a bit.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|This is one case where the movie is better. This is truly a YA (young adult) book which it is intended to be. The writing is Ok but very simplistic. The movie on the other hand was much more riveting and I am looking forward to seeing more come out. If I do read any more books in this series, I'll rent them from my local library instead of buying them.
B005EVVESM|4.0|I only bought this cd because of 1 particular song. I haven't listened to the whole cd, who know's I may end up liking more than just the one song. Yeah I recommend this cd. Seller sent this in great condition, highly recommend the seller to anyone that wants cds.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app!<br />please update soon!<br />add buckets<br />more materials<br />you also need to be able to do more stuff in creative like flint and steel putting stuff in chests redstone and a few at least spawn eggs<br />Thanks!<br />  -a happy customer
1608871452|5.0|This book offers a great summary of each season and the series as a whole, with many fantastic pictures.  It has wonderful behind-the-scenes commentary from many of the crew members.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The alarm clock is an extra wake up alarm for me during the week.  It is an excellent addition to my other alarms.

B008QTVNUI|1.0|I was not expecting porn. The story line was intriguing up until the sex scene 5-7 minutes later.  Wish there was a version option.  I would have chosen the pg-13, tragically a porn scene enhances the story somehow??????
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I am so pleased with this program, which could have easily been a re-hash of batman, Superman, Robin Hood and so many others. The unique take on character elements of each is quite entertaining. Great work!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is great.  It is a great past time when I'm waiting in the doctors office or sitting under the dryer!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|This calendar is very easy to use, and it keeps me organized. I don't have to have Google calendar either which really helps.
B003TNM2ME|5.0|This must-see adaptation of Stephen King's horror novella is classic Frank Darabont. Darabont, who had previously adapted King's The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, brings together a strong cast that includes The Walking Dead's Laurie Holden, Melissa McBride, and Jeffrey DeMunn. The Mist is a dark, thoughtful monster movie, and -- like The Walking Dead's zombies -- the creatures in The Mist are scary, but not nearly as frightening as the people. You probably won't feel good when the credits role, but you'll think about this film for a long time.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I couldn't stop reading and was pleased with the ending. Lots of twists...keeps you guessing. Very nice developed characters and plots.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. It started out a little slow but darn it ended great. I laughed,cried,was heartbroken, and amazed at this book. It is so breath taking and intense at time. It is one that you will find hard to put down because you really just want to what us next in the adventure. I would so love to see the story continue but this one was sure worth every minute. One I will surely be telling others to read. I will be reading it again for sure. Love love live this book and author she us great.
076790382X|3.0|Always interesting adventure with Bill.  It was different than what I expected.  Nice reuse of material but got old after a while.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I now have a reason to carry my Kindle with me when I go out.  Not only is the calculator useful, it comes in handy when I forget my phone.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I have watched this movie a couple of dozen times, and it never gets old. I see reviews that say the acting isn't that good, but I don't agree.  The real-time eight navy SEALS play their roles with passion in a real-life way.  This movie shows them at their best, which is what they were trained for.  The moral ethic held in the movie is awe-inspiring, even though I know people make mistakes.  My heart goes out to those that have to live with the death of their loved ones.  This is truly an inspiring movie which shows the real love and heartbreak involved with these Special Naval Warriors.  I will always hold them in the highest regard, knowing that they are putting themselves in harm's way for me.  I pray you all find your way home!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The sex was a bit repetitive but it was a great story. It has me looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I love that it syncs with my Google Calender and keeps my tasks all in one place. I can also have other people in my family calendar on it at the same time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It`s a great fun game MADE for horse lovers.GET THIS GAME.YOu can take pictures of your horse and pet it.The only thing that would make it better would to be able to get gems more easily.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm addicted to it. I use it all the time when I'm bored. there's so many things to look at and I like organizing my thoughts with pictures.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I really really like this game but you have to get the computer.this did not have a lot of stuf and you can not go to the nether
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Really nice graphics.  Very addictive. If you like jigsaw puzzles, try this one.  I have never played one quite like this before!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Sometimes, its fun to have one's knowledge of history fleshed out by following the fictional fortunes of characters going through it.  Follett is very good at both the history and the stories!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The first time I played the game I was more than halfway through when the game forced closed...after uninstalling &amp; reinstalling I had no further issue with game play. The graphics were amazing &amp; the storyline was unique. Would definitely recommend!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Although only a portion of the book describes the planning and execution of the mission that killed OBL, it also presents the motivation for joining, the training, and career growth of one of the SEALs participating in the OBL raid, Mark Owen, a pseudonym used to protect his identity.  Using only first name pseudonyms when referencing SEAL teammates, Owen spares the reader the often told story of basic SEAL training in favor of meeting him, and the other select few SEALs chosen while competing for a spot on SEAL Team 6, Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU), the Navy's vaunted and most often mentioned counter-terrorism and special missions group.  From training cycle, to stand-by of never more than an hour from his base in Virginia, to deployment, mission planning and execution, his return for brief down time, and a repeating of this cycle many times over, Owen offers fascinating insights into a world of finely tuned readiness most will never experience and even fewer truly appreciate.  Told in a matter-of-fact style, without fanfare or boasting, Owen leads the reader through the murky world of counter-terrorism special operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and then out into the Indian Ocean for the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips of the Maersk Alabama from Somali pirates.  And even though the Bin Laden mission outcome is known beforehand, Owen lets us in on the somewhat subdued emotions of his teammates that makes the &#34;just another day at the office&#34; execution of the Abbottabad raid special for everyone involved, including the reader.  If you've seen &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34;, this book rounds out the film providing substance and reality to the CIA analyst portrayed in that film, and about whom Owen relates his conversations with in his book.  Reading &#34;No Easy Day&#34; gives deeper meaning to the saying, &#34;For those that will fight for it, freedom has a flavor the protected shall never know.&#34;
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game! It would have 5 stars except when you use a save me on the kindle fire, the game crashes. Otherwise really fun game!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The sad thing about Facebook is that I feel a need to have it because it lets me stay in touch with friends and family. But Zuckerberg is such a reprehensible human being that I often hate myself for using it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read by Nicholas sparks and  really just want to thank him personally for touching my life with such an inspiring. Weather this book was 6 dollars or 60 dollars it was worth every penny. Thank you again Nicholas sparks
B000ZHS3E8|5.0|Great sci fi movie. I was only expecting it to be about a 3 star movie, but it kept it keep my interest through the whole movie. I would recommend it to other people who like sci fi movies.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Great heavy duty case (still light) that protects my Kindle when it's in my purse, laptop bag, or traveling.  Would for sure by again!
B00AC8ZJPQ|1.0|Not sure why it got such a good rating.  Acting was really bad, didn't finish watching the movie. Why did it get 4 starts?
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Long Slow movie. Not recommended. All you can hear is Peter Griffin through the whole movie (Seth McFarland). Silly and not worthwhile. Save your money.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|If you already browse the web for guitar tabs, then there's no reason not to have this on your tablet.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She lovesit.  It was her favorite gift.  She says the quality of the DVD is very good.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love the new additions to temple run 2 but the graphics gave me a headache and just all the swerving around. Made me feel sick. But I recommend temple run ORIGINAL.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play this every day its so awesome I found it when my sister was looking for horse games and I looked at it and already new it was going to be awesome the one glitch is it took forever to down load otherwise this is awsome and I recamend it for everyone who loves any kind of farm animal especially horses!!!!!!! everyone should have this app!!!!!!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I'm no 3-D expert or movie critic but Avatar 3D looks pretty good. I'd previously streamed this movie from Amazon, so I already knew the ending.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It's been awhile since I've been so thrilled with a book and so satisfied with an ending. This book isn't perfect, but it's pretty darn close.<br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale is a beautifully written book. The flow of the words, the imajery, the characters, the mystery, make it impossible to put down. It is a book for lovers of books. It reads like a classic and is filled with a dark mystery like a classic.<br /><br />And like a classic, it takes a while to get into. This is my only criticism.  It's slow going at the beginning. But once the story has you in it's grasp, it keeps you intrigued til the very end.<br /><br />I will be adding The Thirteenth Tale to my short list of favorites.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is really great. I loved the first temple run and this one is great. it has new obsticales like ropes and caves. I really recommend this to all those temple run lover's out there. there is twists and turns so its a little bit harder but I still recommend it!
B000EWD1KK|5.0|It was very simple to get rid of the subtext.  The quality of the DVD was wonderful.  I had reservations when I found out it was made in Korea, but the movie was fine.  I'm so glad I bit the bullet and ordered.  I was not disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a great follow up to the original classic. With much more strategy involved in the way the power ups and upgrades are handled, and the new zip line and mine cart sections add a new level of difficulty.
030758836X|5.0|This book is why I love reading.  The plot, characters, setting(OK I'm from the Midwest), and time frame all work together to make for a thrilling adventure.  No spoilers here-fantastic!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Geared to a younger audience, almost put it down after the first few chapters.  However, it got more interesting as i progressed. Loved the interesting plot twists in the latter part of the book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I bought this solely because of Amazons recommendations for me as a scifi reader and the other reviews.<br /><br />And did I enjoy this? Yes! I rarely find myself laughing out loud when reading on my tablet on the subway, but this one did it. If I ever have to choose an item if I get stranded somewhere - it will be duct tape! Following mr Watneys struggle to keep alive as the sole inhabitant (as far as we know) on our not-so-friendly neighborhood planet sure was a fun read. Yes, its a bit of all the technical stuff he had to do, but then again this is written like some sort of diary of sorts. Only &#34;flaw&#34; I could find was that Watney almost didn't seem capable of getting depressed or giving up hope. I sure I would have done, several times - but then I am not an astronaut either :)
B003V4AK8E|4.0|This is a really cool controller. It looks awesome and feels pretty good as far as grip. The one issue I have is with the product design, not the merchant. The D sticks, once broken in a little get stuck in place or just generally stick - a lot. Completely fine for FPS games but will rob you of a goal or two in NHL. Other than that it's a great controller, but something to consider.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love the books, this is the best love story Ever. Ever woman and men should read these books you never know what you could learn about yourself from reading these books. It could be very helpful.
1401216676|5.0|I bought this comic a few days ago. I'm a new fan in the comic's world. I had the intention to verify if really this comic were an inspiration for Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. I found that the Joker is one of the most complex characters in history, maybe because Alan Moore filled him with misery and vengeance. We can see in this story that the Joker's past is his sad treasure.<br /><br />The book is a deluxe hardcover, beautiful. It's a tribute to this comic classic, and cannot be missed in a real batman fan´s collection. I recommend it. Greetings from Guatemala.
0307744434|1.0|This book was a disappointment.  Because it was for my book club I managed to make it to the end.  There is no plot.  Nothing happens for the first half of the 512 pages.  The characters are undeveloped and therefore not interesting.  You get the idea.  By the end I had no idea what the book was about nor do I care.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|While The Night Circus was slow moving at times, it was charming, alluring, and ultimately satisfying. The entire book is mostly about dueling magicians. While that may sound boring and ridiculous, it was quite the opposite. Even magicians have real life problems. I finished reading and wanted the life of a magician.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game. It works well on my kindle fire. I like the fact that you can play minigames on My Horse. Definitely better than My Horse Adventures!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|We have a version of this on our computer that is similar to this.  We really enjoy it.  I expect this one to get used a lot too.
B00001ODGR|2.0|I love Styx and I was hoping this last concert where all the original members performed together would sound great.  Unfortunately it does not sound good.  There is not much range and the sound itself sounds compressed.
B008KE3960|5.0|Lots of fun to play, gives many options to chose when advancing through the game. Would let my grand Children play this one.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|An amazing read. The story envelops you completely, and communicates so clearly her struggles and triumphs on the trail it is as if you are with her. I think most people can relate to her journey an  quest for peace in some way.
B0031QUTBA|5.0|Fabulous. Love this series. It's a must watch. Watch from the beginning to really enjoy. Glad to have the set
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Yes, Temple Run 2 was a surprisingly new, fun twisted game. It works well on a Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire HD, and has been working well for the 5 or 6 days that it's been downloaded. Recommended for a different twist on the original Temple Run.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I think this is something we will use on trips and here at the house.  My husband always pays attention to the weather before he plans anything.
B004KA9UXO|4.0|This is one of those books that I have started and abandoned many times over the years. This time, though, with Goodreads to motivate me, I pushed through, and I'm glad I finished it!<br /><br />The beginning of the book is very political. It begins with House Atreides moving to the desert planet Arrakis (known colloquially as Dune) to take over spice mining operations from the incumbent House Harkonnen at the behest of the Emperor. I really enjoy political intrigue and thrillers, and this stage of the book roped me in and kept me hooked.<br /><br />The middle of the book concerns itself more with people (I cannot say whom for fear of giving anything away) wandering around in the desert. Many pages and chapters are dedicated to this, and to describing how these people grow and change through their experiences. This is the phase where I most often gave up and put the book down, because I'm not a huge fan of desert survival.<br /><br />From around two thirds of the way through, the book returns to it's original political theme, only the stakes are far higher. It's about bribes and deals with guilds and the Imperium, and it's riveting stuff!<br /><br />The finale of the book is filled with action! I'm really glad I stuck with it this time around, as armies clash, cities and planets are annexed, and regimes are overthrown. The ending was absolutely amazing!<br /><br />Following the main story are three Appendices that go about explaining the ecology of Dune, the religion of Dune, and in particular an influential group known as the Bene Geserit. These are written in very much a scholarly tone, and I thoroughly enjoyed them. They may not be everyone's cup of tea, though.<br /><br />Another review I read on Goodreads about it complains about the archaic language used. I can see where the person who wrote that review is coming from. The entire book is written in a particularly dated English, including the dialogue. It was a little distracting, and it's true that people just don't talk like that any more... nor did they any more at the time this book was written.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think that this book may not be everyone's cup of tea, and it goes through ebbs and flows. But for me anyway, it was worth a read, and I enjoyed the way everything came together in the end.don't talk like that any more... nor did they any more at the time this book was written.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think that this book may not be everyone's cup of tea, and it goes through ebbs and flows. But for me anyway, it was worth a read, and I enjoyed the way everything came together in the end.
0066620996|3.0|This was required reading for my job.  Falls in line with most &#34;motivational&#34; books.  Some of the stories are a bit hokey.
B001P3SA94|4.0|Based on actual events. Good story line. The actors did a fine job at portraying the blues legends. six teen words.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|I just got this today and I'm currently in the process of viewing it. The packaging was okay and so far I have nothing to complain. I'm waiting for the second season special edition to come out and get it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I like this game because it is hard most of the time, but when I finally win after trying many many many times, I am so glad. Then I go to the next game.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Since update has been force closing on my Kindle Fire. Please fix. Am I the only one with this issue?
B003BKZW7C|5.0|For the past month or so I have had the privilege to know some very interesting and lovable people. I've known them throughout their childhood and adult lives. I've played with them, built dams and clubhouses with them, drank with them, ate with them, and smoked with them. I will miss them dearly. Even It, I got to know briefly about where It came from and what Its motivations were for being on this earth.<br />I even got to know Derry (the fictional town in which the book is set) like my hometown, and I feel after all this time that I could get from anywhere in town to anywhere else in town with my eyes closed.<br /><br />This familiarity is a testament to the incredibly rich writing skills of Mr Stephen King. Every character and every place is entirely believable and entirely consistent, which is no small feat considering there are so many of them, and the story is so long!<br /><br />This book is meant to be a horror. I must say there are times when I felt \\"creeped out,\\" but I don't think anything in the book truly scared me - although I definitely felt and identified with the terror the characters were feeling all those times!<br /><br />This is a story about repressed memories, lost for many years, that come back when the people need to remember, but bury themselves again when the need is done. It's a story about friendship conquering all, but it's also a story about people coming into your life for a purpose, and then disappearing again when the purpose is completed (which is kind of sad).<br /><br />\\"It\\" was the first Stephen King I've actually READ, although I've seen many of the movies... the movie is NOTHING like the book! It won't be the last Stephen King I read, I can promise you that!, but I'm not quite as dead set against it as I was. Thanks Jerry! :)
B0084AYLK8|5.0|Who am I to wax poetic?,,,I am stunned ,,,, just having finished reading this book.<br />This is the third book of Thomas Hardy that I have been reading.<br />The quality of LANGUAGE blows my mind! We have lost sooooo much in our modern day<br />We have lost the ability to TRULY communicate ,,,,while saying so much saying nothing of import.<br />I really appreciate Thomas Hardy,,,,and will continue reading his work plus recommending it to any Real readers out there,,,,I read to learn not just for enjoyment.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy looking for games, it's a fun game to play.  Easy download.  Use it on my Kindle.  The whole family enjoys it.
B0093LINT2|4.0|I think Intel has describe better about the computer without RAM, Wifi and HD. Its a nice computer after you complete the parts.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I've  always loved pac man. This game is great because it is just like the original. I really enjoy it.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Love, love, love the Imagine Dragons! I'm a fairly new fan, and I think their sound is similar to Coldplay, 30 Seconds to Mars, and Iko. I listen to this album every day!
B0099114WO|5.0|So glad I persuaded my husband (of 35 years) to watch this with me. How smart of Hollywood to recognize the large market of long-married folks born in the 40s and 50s.<br /><br />  This movie beat my expectations, especially after seeing lukewarm reviews here.  Your response to this movie likely depends on if you are a member of the targeted demographic. A friend who is a couple's therapist recommended it. She heard about it from her clients first, who found it helpful.<br /><br />  If you are over 50 and have been married to the same person for over 25 years, I strongly recommend you see this movie with your partner.
B0085W09ME|1.0|This product promises to list all flights.  However when i put in a lengthy route (USA to South Africa) all it did was tell me the total flight time and that it would require transfers.  What airlines?  It never said!  No way to use this to plan a trip.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Who watches Downton and does not get hooked?  I got my sister on it too.  Best New series for me in years.  Excellent change of pace.
B005LAII08|5.0|So many Disney movies have male leads that appeal to boys. It's nice to see two in a row for the ladies!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. inspirational every morning. glad they had this on kindle. now I can take it where ever I go.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Sometimes the writers are a little to far out there with the lengths the main characters go, but it keeps you engaged from start to finish.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very useful in church. Easy to navigate as well. I like having the different Bible versions at my finger tips.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|What a wonderful time suck.  I just wish I could pass the levels a bit quicker.  It takes a bit to get through some of them.
0765325950|5.0|Usually I dread the last book in a series because there are many questions left unanswered.  I was completely satisfied with this ending, it was magnificent and complete.<br />My only regret is that the adventure is now over. It will be a very difficult series to follow.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It took a couple of chapters to really get into the book (maybe because it was in a diary form) but after I got use to the format it was really good.  I didn't like the way the book ended, (reason for 3 stars); it seemed unfinished.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The story is a natural progression from the first book.  The Capitol is upset that Katniss managed to thwart the will of President Snow and now she has to pay the price.  You don't see the twist and turns until you're well into the next chapter.  Something that seemed kind of hazy from the first book was how the Capital could enforce it's will on the districts.  Where do they get the troops?  This little tidbit is explained.  Once you think about it its obvious, but at the time you're reading the story before its explained you don't come up with the duh moment.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Well I have video camera and then i bought a new Canon EOS Rebel T3i.  I wanted the back pack but I didn't needed it.  After putting my equipment in it and carrying it around I love it.  It is big and helpful, but I only use it for putting all of my stuff to keep my stuff organized and together.  I not a big fan carrying  a big camera bag but it gives me a sense of protection either out and about or for storage at home.  It beats sitting on a self collecting dust.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I think leps world 2  is a little chalinging, but thats the fun of it.You can play witch ever leps wrold you want, you don't half to do them in orter like I did
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This struck me as more of an advertisement for games.  I couldn't figure out how to use the main page to get to the free games.  I ended up deleting this one.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have ever seen! It has action, intrigue, romance, and humor! What else could you ask for.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Well I think that more people should get this game because it's a really good game to play and that I really like it a lot.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The story moved along like it does for the first and second book.  One of the premises it brings up is extinction of the human race if to much fighting is done, such as what can happen in a Civil War.  The book never talks about what is outside Panems districts or how many people are exactly in Panem for you to wrap your head around this concept.  Fortunately, this extinction concept is not central to the story, but I would assume if you're talking species extinction you would have enough exposition to back it up.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Gardot's unique approach to music is welcome to the ear.  Great for uplifting the day and for smoothing the daily commute..
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is definitely my new go to game. Very addictive so beware. Lots of different layers to keep you busy. Would like it better if you could have so features running even when you're not using app.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Personally I would have to say that this one was choppy...I understand that the author was trying to wrap things up but I felt that the book was quite rushed at the end jumping forward in time too quickly without building up the the out come. I'm glad to say that I have read the series and it was a quick easy read at that.
B009K0OTVM|5.0|Ordering this tv show from Amazon was extremely easy and efficient. I was sick for a few days and watched the whole season 2 in that time. I loved every second of it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Kat is so torn in every direction that it is hard to figure out what is really going on.  Peers part is even worse.  How they ever end up together is a miracle or a very depressing love story.  There should be a little bit more happiness once they do get together and have kids.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I use avast for my laptops, desktops, phones and tablets, never had a virus, its free and works great.  Love it for phones you can block phone numbers too.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Im going to see these people in a month and wanted my friend to get to know the songs before we get there, it was really fast and very cheap.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The quality of the stream is always impressive. I love that you can purchase the full season, discounting each episode.
B004ZQBP22|2.0|I only liked two tracks ont this album. Not worth the money. Good thing I bought second hand. Again-don't buy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this app so much but one word gems. it is hard because I don't know how to get gems without having to pay. It is super frustrating.
141659521X|5.0|One does not expect that Rapp can do it one more time, but he does -- and always with panache.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|...to the original temple run! zip lines, mine cars and more varying and interesting landscapes make 2.0 more enjoyable and challenging. I'm happy that it was free...but after playing it, I can definitely say that I would have purchased it. GET IT!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this game and haven't had any problems with the app. I like being able to change the background andthe looks of the cards.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The quality of the stream is always impressive. I love that you can purchase the full season, discounting each episode.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This case is GREAT! Keeps my Kindle Fire clean without taking up any extra space in my bag. The cover/stand is a plus!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Good app and I didn't have any trouble doing what I like.  It is just as good as the regular PC version to me.
B001LF347E|5.0|I think the first season of &#34;Merlin&#34; is the best one because it introduces the tale of King Arthur with an interesting modern spin that has never been done before.  The acting in the show is fantastic, especially from the lead actor, Colin Morgan, who plays Merlin.  I also loved the packaging for this set, as it makes it look very &#34;epic&#34; with a cardboard case that opens up to reveal a beautiful scene of the characters.  The bonus features were also very fun and informative, though I did feel like some dragged a little too long.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am not one to post reviews but I just had to say that Icould not put this book down. I loved it!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Yes the characters look great and the special effects are exciting and fun, but the story line is lacking and falls flat in my opinion. This movie could be so much better if they built up the relationships between the characters.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|The quality of the stream is always impressive. I love that you can purchase the full season, discounting each episode.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I ordered a few things and this was the first to come. I LOVE the Dexter series I started watching it on Show Time in the middle of the third season to the end of this last season but I felt like I was missing something not seeing Seasons One and Two. I ordered them and enjoyed them so much I had to catch up on Season Three. It was well worth it. I read descriptions of the first three seasons but watching them was GREAT.  For Christmas my son gave me &#34;on CD&#34; Darkly Dreaming Dexter and I was surprised how accurate Dexter the series is to the book. Without seeing this series I think I would have been &#34;Lost&#34; trying to figure who all the Characters are and who is where.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|It's a difficult task to get my niece's full attention, however Brave not only did that but also stole her heart with its fun story line and amazing quality to details. The animation is beautiful done and the appeal to old legends just did me over. I'm really glad I got this movie for my kid, she's been watching it nonstop for weeks :)
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I was a little surprised that this season didn't come in a fancy package that opened up to reveal a triptych of the characters like the others did.  Instead, it's just a typical cheap DVD box with some flaps for the multiple disks.  Despite that, I love this show for Colin Morgan's incredible acting, and the interesting spin they gave to the Arthurian legend, and this season is no exception to that.  Every episode is full of magic and whimsy.  As far as I'm concerned, this is the last good season of the show, since the fifth and final one put a very depressing spin on it and lost all of the fun wit that made the show so enjoyable to watch.  As such, this will be the last DVD set I buy of it, but this was still a very exciting and important season to the ongoing story of the show.
B00001W9G0|5.0|A great classic DVD that I did not have, the price was great and prompt service, very glad I got it at such a great deal.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Fabulous ! I just LOVE watching shows back to back without interruptions. I really cant wait to get the second season. Too bad its so far away... I always recommend getting full seasons of favorite shows. It beats watching the same old, same old in the cable &#34;Orbit.&#34;
B001QB9H1K|5.0|Good item, new as described, good price. It was for a gift and arrive just in time, thanks! * *
B000V86OKG|5.0|This Season 2 came in fast and I loved watching it. I read on a Dexter web site in detail what the season was about and how it ended but watching it was SO much better and I couldn't wait to see season three. I am going to give these to my son so he can get his wife hooked on Dexter too.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I don't watch movies for deep content.  I watch them to get away from the work day dredge. This one fit the bill for me as it was out there with the alien invasion stuff and the good guys win in the end.
B0061S073A|5.0|We love this app. It keeps our children from making unwanted orders and keeps them from going online. It also protects them.
B009FB3WQ4|5.0|I love everything Babs puts out. There are wonderful people speaking and singing her songs on the DVD (which I of course was a CD) duh
B001TAJGO6|4.0|I recently lost the love of my life. Sad, I remembered this film, the storyline. I hadn't seen it.<br />I guess I am a glutton for punishment.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual Grisham kept me compelled and I could not put this book down either. He is an amazing writer and I can not wait for the next one.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This case is easy to use, and does the job of keeping my Kindle Fire safe.  It's well made and well worth the investment!  Highly recommended!
B004X4R49Y|5.0|A very educational movie. It showed how even great people have difficulties and as long as they are willing to work on them they can overcome them. A good movie for all ages.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is a very good book with many twists and turns! I would recommend the book to anyone who enjoys mysteries!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|i like the game but it kind of sucks that all of your coins and achievements are gone from temple run one I wish we could make some kind of account
B007D5E7C2|5.0|Great film. I was going to get these on seperate DVDs & then I thought, &#34;I KNOW they're going to come out with both together, just wait.&#34;<br />Besides, enough time has passed since I saw them in the theatre that watching them will be a real pleasure again. Go Go Yubari....
B008XG1X18|4.0|I enjoy it.  I've found many helpful and interesting receipes, great project to do with the kids.  Unfortunately I have dial up and it's hard to get on a lot of the time.  But when I am able I have a blast. My daughter raves about it and has made a number of the crafts.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I can't think of enough ways to say how marvellous this book is!  Omg. Love love loved it. So wicked and dark in a way only someone with body issues might understand. Someone who knows what it is like to stare into the darkest most animal part of being human and deal. We are all a mixture of health ans sickness and melting pots of pain that sometimes floats too close to the surface.  I adored this book. Hahaha
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a lot better than temple run I am 14 and I love this game it is so cool you should get it plus its free
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was deep, heart felt and real. It made me feel an entire spectrum of emotions. I will remember this one.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|Simply the Best<br /><br />Thriller by far is the greatest album every created by a human being.  Long live the King of Pop
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is amazing and think it is fun for all ages even my baby sister,3, enjoys playing this game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant about reading the book or watching the movie.  I didn't think I would like the whole idea of it.  But after taking to a friend who encouraged me to read the book.  I was not disappointed.  Just started Catching on Fire and hope it's as rivating as the Hunger Games.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|If I had written a review halfway through, it would've been 5 stars. It was awesome until then. I found the last quarter boring and the end unsatisfying.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Got this game for my daughter and I to play. We are both enjoying it a lot so far.<br />Great graphics and beautiful horses although expensive.
B009NT0I06|5.0|I was sooo happy with this purchase I was seeing Red!!! Love this!!! It sounds great and looks great! So happy that I bought this item!!
B0051BLT4O|1.0|This product. as a photography book it is severely lacking on usable content.  The pictures and layout aren't professional and leave you really wanting more.  I saw the print product and it was wonderful but they obviously hastily put out a kindle format book that isn't equivalent.  On the iPad (3rd Gen) it looks pathetic with the text not aligning properly with the images and the images themselves being so pixelated as to be almost unusable.  On my Retina display MacBook Pro the images don't even scale enough to be relevant.  I've seen this before with Kindle books in photography but I have seen other's with a much more relevant and professional product.  I would seriously consider waiting till a better kindle version comes out or buy the print book (if your into the whole retro thing).
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very well written without any macho BS. We are very fortunate to have people of this caliber to do the job that they do.
B00AMBLDEE|1.0|I have been generally satisfied with Amazon Instant Video, however, downloads recently have become rediculously slow. My network speed is on speakeasy.net speed test is 25 meg down and 20 meg up. Is Amazon having video distribution problems or is my ISP throttling speed? Not sure, but the download is cancelled at 2 mins downloaded and the Blu-Ray DVD was retrieved at a local automated box in about 7 mins. I will look into this further but this is very disappointing speed.
B004WR125O|5.0|Connects my Onkyo TX-NR616 to the web. Enables me to be walking into the home from the car while setting a song from the internet radio app on my phone to be playing before I enter (and other such cool features).  I have no idea why Onkyo doesn't build it as part of the receiver
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Good service, the DVD got to me quick. Was expecting almost three weeks and got to me in under two.
1476712042|5.0|Couldn't put the book down - it's a more realistic, and completely invigorating love story. I was so emotionally drawn to the main characters and wasn't disappointed in the ending. Overall a great story!
B007PS0DTI|2.0|I'm a huge fan of the 'Underworld' movies and was SO excited to see a new movie come out in this show but must say I was very disappointed.  Just glad I never purchased the dvd before seeing it.  What the movie lacked in story line they tried to make up for in violence.  There is one scene where it actually looks like something out of the 'zombie' type video games you can play, I couldn't believe it.  Kate Beckinsale is as always, phenomenal, but the movie is a real disappointment.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom.  Pure Genius.  Love Wes Anderson.  Simply adore Bill Murray.  Pure Brilliance.  Wanted to absorb every color, listen to every line.  Masterpiece.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is quite an amazing book. I loved every moment of it. Sometimes I wanted to come through the book and smack Sky and others I wanted to do nothing but hug her. She is everything you want in a great main character. Holder is such an amazing and attractive character. He has got to be in my top three characters that I am most attracted too! This awesome book gives you a heartache, then heals it, gives you another heartache, then heals it again! It's quite the thrill. I am in awe of this book. I am in live with this book! ;)<br />P.s. Breckin the 'Mormon' and Six are hilarious! Just the needed comic relief!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game sooooo much! I got it today and I am already in love this game! get it!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|The basics are that you start out as a space ship that shoots out at small or big colorful enemies.  You can buy more lives and better ammunition.  You can pause the game and resume whenever.  The levels are either easy or hard depending on what difficulty level you choose.  I would recommend this game to whoever played something relevant to galaga or any other fly and shoot games.  This game is really entertaining, and of course, RADIANT!  Five stars.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I have to say, this sequel didn't live up to its predecessor. I was very impressed with Bared to You, it was a very well-written, well-developed story that sucked me in and left me waiting impatiently for the sequel. I found it to be a much more believable story than 50 Shades, with a lead female character that was easy to relate to and understand. Even the sex scenes felt more based in reality than those in 50. I willfully ignored the similarities between the two stories because I thought Bared to You was far better.<br />But this book really disappointed me. It felt unfinished, repetitive, and the twist in the plot was painfully obvious.<br />The justifications Eva felt she had to give to the \\"reader\\", 3 times in the first 50 pages, about how she and Gideon were \\"addicted to each other\\" and whatnot, got very tedious. No one is going to be reading this book without reading the first one in the series, and there is no need to try and explain this over and over and over again. It almost felt like maybe the author had forgotten she had written a paragraph about it just a few pages previous. Also trying to squeeze in a recap of an entire book into a couple sentences here and there felt forced and cheated Bared to You out of the fully developed emotions and understandings that it contained.<br />Spoiler alert---<br />The scene in the car after the concert was, in my opinion, waaaay to strikingly similar to one in 50 Shades (in the second or third book, I don't remember which). Even the mention of the safeword was similar. This bothered me a lot, and I'm not sure why.<br />And the twist with Nathan was really not the slap in the face the author was hoping for. I couldn't, for the life of me, understand why Eva hadn't put the pieces together herself. And as far as the ending goes - I don't think much was left unresolved. It felt like the end of the series and there are no loose ends to tie up as far as I'm concerned. Gideon's past was revealed enough, even though not in its entirety, and they're back together and they'll make it work, blah blah the end. I won't be reading the third book.<br /><br />Regardless of all the above, I do think Sylvia Day is a very talented writer. I liked her style and character development and I was really thoroughly impressed with her other book. I'm sure she has written other great books, this one just wasn't her best work. I'm wondering if the pressure to flush out a sequel left a lot of the editing undone.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love this series. Lots of fun, full of adventure and romance(the clean kind) with a consistent support line (not full of holes and contradictions) I love the characters, the setting, the combining of worlds
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is not age appropriate for my daughter who really wanted it.  I played it with her for a while, but it is more for a child that is able to read and understand the game. That being said, it has a lot of new and fun adventures and would not get boring for an older child.  There are a lot of ways to spend money in it, which I find a bit scary if I were not able to monitor it.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Simply, this book changed my life. And for that, I will be forever thankful. For the smiles and the many many tears. Wonderful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is one of the greatest. My daughter loves it. It is really nice for her to have a realalisticn hores that you can pet and groom and feed.
0425252868|5.0|I highly recommend this book, It is well written and never boring.<br />I won't go into the story because the book does a much better job of telling it than I ever could<br />Buy it read it<br />&#34;Very interesting&#34;
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm usually not a fan of apps that you continuously have to maintain but ireally enjoy this game. its like nintendogs but with horses. takes a while to install but its worth it
B005VPRF0M|5.0|Legos and super heroes, what more can a nine year ask for.  He played with it for hours the first day he could.
B002HK9IDQ|4.0|Wanted it for my library. It is a favorite with my entire family.  Showed it to my son-in-law- who would you believe has never seen \\"My Fair Lady\\" in the moviet or stage?!<br />Robert E. Yim M.D.

B000FBFN1U|2.0|I read somewhere that this man is an american J.R.R.T.  No, he is not.  For starters, J.R.R.T. had monsters, creatures etc.  I think this will be the last book by this man that I read.  At first, his porn fantasy wasn't so bothering until this particular book where it became more and more adult related and a full chapter about sex is just boring and not very exciting.  Especially with how horrible it is written.  I hate to burst the author's bubble but it usually is \\"slopping wet\\" in that area, as he so decidingly stated.<br />It is just boring to keep reading about family vs. family vs. family with little description about anything else.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Takes awhile to figure out how to completely accomplish goals w/o spending money. However my grand daughter loves feeding and jumping. Over unique.
B009XTF8KQ|3.0|Good Scare. Not too much in surprises but if you want a good horror flick that won't disappoint, this is it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|But terrible writing altho I wish I had written it.  Looks like that's what the public wants and I could use the money<br />R.E.Yim

1419705849|5.0|Definitely one of my 8 year old sons favorite books. he said everyone in his class has it too, so apparently there's lots of 3rd graders who feel the same way!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Based on  first chapter, i did not expect this book to make me weep and cry. The story is touching , smart. Some scenes are tough, shocking and very heartbreaking . But in the end, it turns out that love and hope is all we need to fix our hearts.<br />I was looking for a romance novel, and i found the real life of real people, authentic and unbreackable hope.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Good decision  great definitions I really appreciate the help. Now I can have definitions. Where ever I go. Sweet. Awesome
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a good book. I was worried about how it would end but I have to say I am pleased.
B005LAII80|5.0|I have to be honest here.  I liked the Stallone film, Judge Dredd.  It has not much value as a good film, but it sure as hell is entertaining, and sort of a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Dredd, though, is not a guilty pleasure.  It's a pleasure you should be proud of.  It's a shame this movie didn't do well in theaters, and that will surely not help Hollywood make more R-rated comic book movies, which is terrible.  It just so happen that R-rated movies are not profitable, and it's because the general public has a bad concept of them due to lack of information.  Remember this: because this movie failed, we're more likely to see another PG-13 Punisher and the same for Deadpool, if it ever gets greenlit.<br /><br />Anyway, onto the movie.  If you've seen the previous adaptation or read the comics, you'll know the basic gist.  Otherwise: it's the future and crime is rampant.  The justice system has been compressed, and streets are watched by special agents who are there to fulfill the role of police, judge, jury and executioner.  These agents are called \\"Judges\\".  Judge Dredd is one of the best, and one of the most feared by the criminals.  Judges ride in motorbikes and use a special gun, which is able to dispense several forms of firepower.<br /><br />That's the one thing this movie has in common with the previous one, otherwise, it's an entirely different plot: there's a new drug being popular on the streets, called \\"Slo-Mo\\", which makes people temporarily sense the world at a really slow speed.  The creator of this drug, a prostitute-turned-drug-lord named Ma-Ma inadvertedly drags Judge Dredd into her turf, and now she'll do anything to get rid of him.<br /><br />Dredd, though, not only is a formidable opponent, but also carries a wild card: rookie female Judge Anderson, who's being tested by him in order to keep her job, due to her terribly low skills, except for one: powerful psychic abilities.<br /><br />Now, I'm not going to compare this film to the other one, but there are a couple of things to mention.  One, this film is slightly more rooted in reality.  Second, while the first one changes location all the time, this one is almost completely set inside Ma-Ma's building (Die Hard style).<br /><br />A third, interesting feature is that while Karl Urban has nowhere nearly such an imposing figure as Stallone does, it actually works well for this film.  Going back to the Die Hard comparison, it makes Dredd a more relatable character.  Dredd should not be a character we like, but he's so well written and portrayed that you can't help but do it.  He's not a superpowered individual, or a wealthy man, or even a chosen one with a hidden ability.  He's just a regular trained policeman with a powerful belief in the law.  And, when put in charge of the situation, he becomes an unrelenting badass.<br /><br />Judge Anderson is an interesting character, who shows some great character progression, and it's not just \\"the girl\\", like Judge Hayden was in Stallone's film.  She's here to be a character, not to become an object of desire.  Ma-Ma, on the other hand, is quite a terrifying villain.  You can easily believe she's able to handle all the power at her hand, and understand why everyone is so afraid of her.  Both actresses do a terrific job in their roles.<br /><br />The film itself is visually beautiful, particularly in the slow-motion scenes (which, unlike in other films, actually make sense here), though quite gory, so if that somehow displeases you, be warned.  The settings are well done, though limiting the setting to the inside of a building doesn't do much to show the futuristic looks of the world.  That, though, is not important for this particular story.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great film, one that shouldn't be missed by anyone who enjoys a good comic book story with lots of spectacular action.  Unless you're looking for romance, there's probably something for you here, so go get it.  Purchase this movie on DVD or Blu Ray, so it makes enough money to warrant a sequel.  Because, trust me, you want one., so it makes enough money to warrant a sequel.  Because, trust me, you want one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is an excellent game in having the responsibilities of horse but in a virtual world<br />One of the best games I've ever played
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I live this book!! No I LOVE this book!! Holder and Sky or Hope are very mature for their age but with all they have been through in their childhood it makes sense. The twists and turns will keep you up all hours of the night reading!
B004RZGUBM|5.0|I really like Dickens, this allows you to see all his work and read without several books listed on your kindle.  I am not very happy with the difficulty to access each book to determine any details.  I really dislike the Kindle's inability to allow you to see the name of the book you are reading.  My daughter gave me a new Kindle, now I can see the name of the book after hours of reading and forgot the name.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Greasy game and very entertaining. I couldn't put it down once I started playing.<br />I can't wait for the second one.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|There are few Albums out there in which every song is a good one, well this is one of those albums.
030758836X|3.0|I'm an avid reader and read a minimum of 40 books a year, closer to 50.  Recently, I feel like I'm completely out of touch with what is happening around me in the literary world.  Most of the books that are on the best seller list, I find either mediocre or completely lacking with Gone Girl being in the mediocre category.<br /><br />Was Gone Girl a page-turning thriller?  Absolutely.  Was it a well written, plausible story? Absolutely not.<br /><br />What happened to well written books?  Why does the main character in this book sound like a whiny teenager even though she's supposed to be in her 30s?  Why is this dumbing down of literature happening around us?  I know this is supposed to be a review of Gone Girl, and it is but it is also a lament of the well written and thought out book.<br /><br />The first part of the book was sound and a real page turner, despite the fact that the writing in the female character's journal got on my last nerve.  It was truly the journal of a 16 year old girl, even though you later find out that this is part of the story.  The writing however, never improves!  Be that as it may, the first half was well developed, credible and interesting.<br /><br />Then you get to the second half.  Oh my, what to say about the second half.  It continues to be a page turner but not in the way you would think.  You keep wanting to turn the page to see if the foolishness of the story line can somehow be saved.  Alas, it cannot.  The story continues to become more implausible and finally explodes in a spectacular display of absurdity.<br /><br />My other problem with this book was the portrayal of the female character.  ***SPOILER ALERT***: In the first half, she is a pushover, mousy wife who will put up with anything to hold on to her husband because she is so desperate for a man.  In the second half, she's a psychotic, conniving witch who outsmarts everyone but does it because,... yes, you guessed it, she will do anything to hold on to her husband because she is so desperate for a man. And remember, this is a portrayal of a woman by a female author.  Between the portrayal of women by other women in this book and 50 Shades of Grey, all ll I can say is, God help us all.<br /><br />I give it three stars because I finished it and the first half was good.  But the positives end there.  I think I'll take a break from best sellers for a while....cause she is so desperate for a man. And remember, this is a portrayal of a woman by a female author.  Between the portrayal of women by other women in this book and 50 Shades of Grey, all ll I can say is, God help us all.<br /><br />I give it three stars because I finished it and the first half was good.  But the positives end there.  I think I'll take a break from best sellers for a while....
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I have found that people either love this movie or hate it. I think it really depends on how much time you've spent out of the country. Casual travelers or people who've never left the U.S. may not appreciate the loneliness of being half way across the world from home. I think this movie does a great job of capturing the theme of \\"misery loves company\\". There are short bursts of comedy, but don't expect Ghostbusters or Caddyshack humor just because Bill Murray's on the cover. Murray is fantastic in this dramatic role, and should have won an Oscar. If you didn't like it, spend some time in Japan and then come back and watch this. Great job, Sofia Coppola!
B00006AUIG|1.0|I have no use for this movie, and had to watch another movie just to get it out of my head as much as possible.  It started out well... but @ the end when all was revealed .... it was just another stupid movie with a lot of scenes and elements that had nothing to do with nothing... they just wanted you to think they did.  It was like some sort of collage... bits and pieces just thrown together... but with nothing else tying them to each other.  Trying not to give anything away... in case you choose to make the mistake of wasting your time watching the movie, the story surrounding the one disappeared character made no sense at all in the end.  I absolutely recommend that you PASS on this movie and watch something else more worth your time and money.  REALLY.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Jk Rowling has once again created a masterpiece of literature. Very different from the Harry Potter series, JK Rowling has managed to create another book that captures the minds imagination. Must read!
B0094PNV8A|5.0|The Human Stain was an interesting movie, as always very good acting by Nicole Kidman and Anthony Hopkins. Good movie!
0452270073|4.0|You can find this review and many others on my blog The Dancing Nerd Writes Again.<br /><br />Initial Thoughts:<br /><br />I read this book as a requirement for my Literature and War class.<br /><br />Before I started this book I wasn't sure what to expect but I assumed there would be lots of war scenes and gore, typical of a war movie. To my surprise, that's not exactly what I got. I would also like to note that Pat Barker is a women, which was something many of the students in my Literature and War class were unaware of and they said that this knowledge changed the way they viewed the book and some of the characters.<br /><br />Spoilers!<br /><br />There are a lot of characters in this book. Pat Barker begins conversations between the characters naturally, as if we the audience already know what's going on. At times it was a bit disorienting and I felt like I needed a play sheet to keep track of all the patients. Once the book got rolling it was easier to keep track of who was who based on their back stories.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, this book wasn't simply about war and gore, although a few scenes do come to mind. This novel focused primarily on the effects of war on all the people around it. It looks at the soldiers, the doctors, the women left at home, and the families. This book is written from a few different point of views, but the primary voice is that of Dr. Rivers, a psychiatrist who deals with the worst cases of mental war wounds.<br /><br />This is the first book in a series, and many of the characters story lines are left open. A few of the more notable characters are Billy Prior, Sassoon, Owens, Dr. Rivers, and Anderson. It is my understanding that the characters in the book were based on real people from WWI. It was really eye opening for me to see how deep the effects of war go and how severely it changes people.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />It's hard for me to give a good review of this book without giving too much away in the spoilers section. I did enjoy this book and I'm happy that I read it. It wasn't gory, for those of you who have light stomachs, although there are two or three scenes that stand out pretty vividly. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in different aspects of war, especially the after math of war on mental stability. It was an interesting read and I am considering reading the rest of the series to find out what happened to the characters.<br /><br />Rating:3.5/5 stars
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I think it is very easy to use and I can keep track of all my ebay transactions just like I do on my computer.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Everytime i try to go play it, it goes back to my home screen. I dont know if anyone else had the same problem.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app has really good graphics! Was a lot better than I expected. Pretty fun. Could be better. But all in all a good game.it's helps pass the time
B007JMW46U|4.0|I am so happy this is now available in illustrated form. And with illustrations by Sidney Paget no less, the original illustrator of the stories! This is a wonderful addition for any Sherlock Holmes Fan!
B000XXTCF8|5.0|Van Morrison's greatest hits...for the VM fan, it's a &#34;need I say more&#34; moment, but if you haven't listened to VM in awhile, this is a great album to plug in and enjoy his talent across a variety of styles and eras.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for the next one! Love watching history through the eyes of the family.  Especially watching daughters of a privileged family spread their wings and test the times.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|He's the master of song writing and telling stories that convey the various emotions of life. His music since the mid '90s has been the best of his career. He is an American treasure.
1432794426|5.0|Karen very generously provided a free download of her book on kindle over the holidays. I took up this offer. It was an incredibly kind act. I have read part of the book and I look forward to reading the balance. From the very beginning you can feel that she admires Michael Jackson. She stated in the acknowledgements that she wanted to provide a tribute to him, and from what I have read she has done that. She is respectful in the manner she writes and it is a joy to read.<br /><br />I really like the way this book has been written. I would recommend it to a friend.  Well done to the author and thank you for producing it and being so generous.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|Very nice padded case just what I thought it would be,very satisfied with it, protects my kindle.would recommend it to others
0425263908|1.0|The parallels between this story and that stupid 50 shades trilogy are too close to not be copied. I can appreciate that the woman in the cross books isnt a pathetic, naive, little girl (Ana in 50 shades). This series was also written for adults, as  opposed to the laughable prose of the 50 shades book.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This was a great final chapter to the trilogy.  Surprises abound and new characters to read about in the future.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Excellent sound, great debut album full of great songs. I have a feeling they're the real deal and not just &#34;one good album wonders&#34;.
B002ZM74Y6|1.0|i had freinds over to show this great movie and the sound laged so bad it was unwatchable.I dont think i should have to pay for it.<br />.
B000EZ7ZXQ|2.0|Just recently broke down and purchased a blu-ray player, so we are buying blu-ray discs of our top favorite movies. 50 First Dates is one of those movies. It arrived today packaged in what looks like a vacuumed packed paper bag. When I opened it, I found the spine on the blu-ray case had cracked and split open. There were pieces of plastic all over the inside of the case and on the the blu-ray disc. Also the case liner card is torn and ripped on the spine and back. In all my years of purchasing items online I have never come across a crappier way of shipping a product especially when using the USPS. I will never order from Wonder Book & Video (wonderbook.com) again. At the least, they should have used a bubble wrap envelope; I would even pay a little more for shipping for the added protection. Extremely disappointed.<br /><br />**UPDATE**  1/29/13<br />Contacted seller and received prompt reply. They naturally offered to refund my money and shipping cost, but they also offered a 50% refund if I wanted to keep the product. Since the blu-ray disc was not damaged, I opted for this alternative for the damage to the case and liner. Although I appreciate the prompt response, and the refund, the company never responded directly to my complaints about poor product shipping packaging. Because of this, and the possibility of it happening again, I doubt I will ever order from them in the future.
B002MVS18S|5.0|Saxon ! What can I say? I love this band past, and present. While the 3 releases of Rock the Nations , Destiny, and Innocence Is No Excuse, differ from the 3 major prior releases and the later albums, they definetly are not anything to shy away from. All three are great!<br /><br />  Innocence Is No Excuse gives us some great songs, Rockin Again, Devil Rides Out, Rock n Roll Gypsy, Everybody Up, well hell all of them. There are not many bands from the 80s that have as strong a run and long discography as Saxon. And they still rock ! Still tour and still headline Wacken Metal festival. Ill take them over Metallica and Iron Maiden any day. So if ya love rock and early metal and you havent given Saxon a chance you should be thinking twice because there just isnt anything else out there thats any better !<br />  Long Live Saxon!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Looking forward to the next chapter in this series. Hope it's as good as the Twilight saga, which I love love love!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I found  this to be an easy and entertaining book to read, well written,  however I felt there was no clear conclusion  and the  book just ends.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I've been a TV junkie for years and thought I saw it all.  I mean what can they do that hasn't been done before?  Well, they pulled it off. I've never quite seen a show like American Horror Story.  You'd think a show like this would be on HBO or Showtime.  Great job FX.  Truly an original and already a classic!
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Love the color as it really stands out in my tote and I can find it! Very sturdy either portrait or landscape.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The Blu-ray edition of this series is still the standard for high-definition home theaters.  The quality of the video is simply profound.<br /><br />The content is amazing, of course.  Many have heralded it as the greatest documentary series of all time.  I don't feel qualified enough to make that determination, but the breadth of information contained on these discs brought the natural world more to life than the entirety of my education ever did.<br /><br />I prefer the Richard Attenborough edition, since his voice is appropriately professorial and filled with gravitas.  By all accounts, the Sigourney Weaver edition is quite good, as well.<br /><br />Anyway, you should have a copy of either.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Only issue I had with it was that it didn't last long enough.  It was a quick and easy read, but was still great!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I love having access to my files on my phone. Being able to work when and as needed solves many problems.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Make you wish you were 15 again. What a great fantasy.  She builds good characters, I recommend it to anyone wishing to go on a great trip.
B000002O1Q|5.0|This movie is a classic. I watch it over and over again.  Will give it triple starts.  No other way to say it.<br />Buy this movie
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|The first season of a show, even a premium one like Dexter, is usually regarded as the weakest since the writers and actors are still getting the hang of the characters and the kinds of plots they want to tell.<br /><br />With the exception of the pilot, which has moments where Michael C. Hall was still developing his take on the character, the entirety of the season is handled deftly and consistently.  The skill of writers and the quality of the source material, combined with incredible acting, combined to create the first show to convince me that I could root for someone who's not even qualified to be called an antihero because his actions are so violent and gruesome.<br /><br />Despite having truly brilliant moments in subsequent seasons, this one stands above them all with having the best ensemble cast (how I miss you, Sergeant Doakes) and the most compelling villain.  (The serial killer everyone pursues in this season has a sense of style and craftiness that makes him more terrifying than future antagonists.)  Dexter is far closer, on an emotional level, with this storyline than he ever seemed to feel after.  And Deb's arc in her quest to jump from Vice to Homicide is interesting with how hard she strives to please her father, who has been gone for years.<br /><br />That being said, the entire series is still quite good, so don't be afraid to keep going after this first season.  Just brace yourself for the realizing that this is as good as it gets.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Uh u Bhutto was going to get the cover of this rating and the rest of the cover of this year and
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book and the whole series. These books definitely kept me on my toes the whole time I was reading them.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|I liked the game, it works well, but when im playing the one player mode with the black pieces aand i win, it shows the computer as the winner.<br />also, in the two players mode, it's confusing that it spins every time one makes a move.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It will let me play it as soon as I install it but if I get off the game to play a different one it just sits there on the same screen and won't let me do anything.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|The series is wonderfully written, acted, produced, and everything else.  You should already know that before even considering buying this Blu-ray set.  There are many other reviews that cover this around the Internet.<br /><br />The set itself is well made, though it has the oddity of having two slip-covers.  The first is a thin, art-only cover that features embossed animals that represent the various families in the series, which surround a picture of Ned Stark (Sean Bean) sitting on the Iron Throne.  The second is a sturdy, non-relief adorned version of the same picture.  I'm not certain why they didn't merge the two together here.<br /><br />The set folds out and features pictures of some of the major characters from the show.  The artwork on the discs themselves is pretty spartan, only featuring dark-gray sigils of the major families in the series against black backgrounds.  I really like this austere presentation.  They also through in a pamphlet that includes episode summaries, family trees for each of the major houses, and a map of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.  It all looks pretty slick.<br /><br />The content of the discs is also wonderfully done, with a number of interesting features, with a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff.  (Some of the features are a little repetitive, repurposing the same interview clips, but they're all worth watching nevertheless.)<br /><br />The vexing layout I mentioned in the title of this review comes from the simple fact that HBO really spread the episodes across the five discs irregularly.<br /><br />Disc 1: Episodes 1 & 2<br />Disc 2: Episodes 3, 4 & 5<br />Disc 3: Episode 6<br />Disc 4: Episodes 7, 8 & 9<br />Disc 5: Episode 10<br /><br />In addition to this, the special features are all spread out to wherever they could fit them on each disc.  I wish they found a way to move the episodes around to free up one of the discs for the special features exclusively.<br /><br />The reason having everything spread out irregularly is confusing is that the main menu shows all of the available content across the entire set, not just that individual disc, with no warning that you'll be switching discs until you actually click on them.  When we first got the set, my brother and I sat down to watch all the special features first, and after every couple, we had to change the disc to the next.<br /><br />The episode layout really gets you when you start up your player with the disc already inside, without having seen which episode numbers are listed on which discs, and you sit through all the extensive legal warnings (that seem to take up at least a minute or more) to discover that you have the wrong disc in there.  (Thankfully, the menu seems to handle disc changes well, so when it prompts you to insert the next disc, you don't have to sit through the legal warnings all over again.  This is appreciated.)  Even if you take note of which episodes are on which discs, you'll find you have to get up and down a lot if you plan to marathon through this.<br /><br />Despite the weirdness, the show and the set are so beautifully done otherwise that I'm forced to give it 5 stars.

B005K17RU0|4.0|This app works very well. I like the many features that are available. It has been very useful for my family.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Graphics are very good, tilting is worse for me than the first one. I like the new things they added like mine carts, but I hope there will be more characters to play as like in the first one.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I really enjoyed this read. After a while I realised that I couldnt put down the book. The story carries you on a real roller coaster. There is always something that is happening. It was an interesting point of view to write from.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE this game.its amazing,  but its a bad influence, it teaches us to run from fat cops.  ;)<br />one of the best games ive ever played though
B0015AARJI|4.0|The Dualshock remains one of the true standards in gaming, and has seen Sony consoles through three consoles.  I regret to say, however, that the Xbox 360 has one major advantage over the Dualshock, and as the title of this review says, it's the placement of the left analog stick.<br /><br />Due to the way the controller is usually held, the primary areas your thumbs should rest are above the analog sticks.  On the left side, this is the D-pad; on the right, these are the four face buttons.  The right side works perfectly because of how often those buttons are used compared to the right analog stick, which is usually relegated to being your camera control in 3D environments.<br /><br />On the left side, the area in question, the primary resting area is a legacy D-pad, which has almost no place in 3D gaming anymore, aside from being used for seldom used commands.  (An example of this would be squad commands in first-person shooters.)<br /><br />The result of this is that your left hand is always angled awkwardly on the lower side of the controller to access what is usually the movement stick.<br /><br />Sony has indicated that they will retire the Dualshock for the fourth-generation PlayStation.  In doing this, I hope they rectify this oversight.  (I fear we'll get a mostly motion-based controller, which I fear will ill-suit hardcore games.)<br /><br />Otherwise, this controller is built extremely well.  The texture of the sticks, the smoothness of their action, the feel of the buttons -- everything is great.  The use of standards like Bluetooth and a mini-USB charging port is also brilliant and welcomed.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Ax is so immature the character nearly destroyed this read for me.  However plot twists good humor redeemed the read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is great for little kids. They learn to take care of something without actually taking care of something. It's great for the future.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very addictive everything is sweet and amazing what more can I say? I'm speechless it's better than the first one!!!!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Why do I have to enter a name each time I finish a game?  Where are explantions of different games?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|great way to stay in touch with my family and friends from my kindle as well as my laptop and phone, what next? hmmm great user friendly app
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's an awesome game that everyone should play<br />It's a quick loading game but sometimes boring it's a hold bunch of type of games
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|very cought up in story could not put it down a must read for anyone the people come alive in the trilogy can't wait for the rest.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a fun game to play.  I love mysteries and hidden object games and this offered both! I can't. wait for part two!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is great worth the download. You have a great horse that listens very well. So worth it all. Seems like it is in real life.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just love Masterpiece Theater, have not watched a show I did not get hooked on.  The costumes, scenery, and acting all terrific.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought this game was much better than the first Temple Run! I highly suggests buying this great game now!
B0055PMJMW|3.0|I love most Michael Connelly books - but I found these short<br />stories much to short.  There is no real depth to the plots.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|This took a little getting use to as it has a board with trip buttons to find what you are looking for. Problem was which button to select as some things could be on more than one button and the Kindle doesnt have the fastest processor around.
B009ZE27US|3.0|It really doesn't accurately read your age.  It can be way off, but sometimes it's right. It's just a silly game that makes people laugh.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|You will begin watching this with the intention of seeing one episode and then doing something else.  Suddenly, you realize that it is 3 am and you can't quit now without seeing the whole season to the end.<br /><br />Love this show!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|neat but it will not let me back in, even with wick I hv tried to uninstall it then re-install it but tht didn't work then I tried to restart my kindle but tht didn't work either and now I don't know what to do!!!!!!
B00004ZELJ|5.0|It is amazing. It deserves it's 5 stars as you get to see all the talents of the Backstreet Boys. As well as see, what makes them music super stars and the most famous Man Band, since The Beatles, New Kids on the Block, and Boyz2Men combinded. They even play instruments, sing whole solo songs, dance their asses off, and flirt on stage like you wouldn't believe. Dance in suits and with chairs, like only they can. That is why I gave it 5 stars and anyone who truely appreciates arts and music will love this DVD/VHS(or any future formants) of this preformance.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|everyone. has told me a bout it and so I got it I. do it in all my free time its great awesome I don't even know the right word for it!!!!!!!!!
B006O3MU96|1.0|I tried it maybe once and gave up. You have to move the device a certain way and if you don't you lose.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game, my kids have been having a lot of fun with it. Great interaction for younger ones too. Love it.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Amazing movie. The movie is filled with a cast of characters that you cannot help but fall in love with. Legolas is my favorite.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|another good game, however, have to figure out how I can use it without being connected to internet..<br />I think you have to download it...
B00870ZH3U|4.0|Ok, first of all **SPOILER ALERT**  I really did like the fact that the story line gets wrapped up and Christine FINALLY makes the right decision IMO, I mean, I always rooted for the Phantom :)  Now, for the seeming timeline discrepancies.  I read an interview with ALW about the storyline.  Here's the scoop, Christine seeks out the Phantom and spends the night with him AFTER the end of the last story, the phantom wakes up before Christine, realizes he can't give her what she needs (or so he thinks)and he leaves and makes his way to Coney Island. You can actually pick up on most of the one-night-stand story if you listen really close to Christine's and Phantom's duet 'Beneath a Moonless Sky'.  Hence how he can look so 'surprised' when she kisses him at the end of Phantom of the Opera; it really was their first kiss.  Raoul goes from hero to zero because at heart, he's always been a spoiled rich boy and couldn't deal with Christine's talent and popularity, forcing her to give up performing for the last 5 years (you can pick up on that too if you listen carefully).  He is unhappy because he (rightfully)realizes he cannot give Christine the music that she desperately craves and because of this, she will never truly be happy with him.  This of course, drives him to excessive drinking and gambling, wracking up the debt that eventually causes him to finally let Christine perform again for a huge sum that will help the family's financial woes.  I really didn't find the one-night-stand or Raul's alchoholism huge character stretches. The music in Love Never Dies is ok but NO WHERE NEAR as good as Phantom of the Opera unfortunately.  It just didn't have the big epic emotional feel of the first score.  But, all in all, if you're a Phantom phan, I think you should at least watch this to close out the story.  It DID make me cry, so it couldn't have been that bad ;)
B007TXN4TK|3.0|I liked it at first, but then I realized I would have to pay to play more than just a handful of songs. I might buy the full version at some point.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I use this board every time I use my computer and I love it. It has all of the buttons you need. Minecraft Players: This board is great except for when you have to switch items. If you're content with using the scroll wheel on your mouse/trackball (I have a trackball, Logitech M570, looooove it) to switch items, then this board will do just fine. With the Windows 8 interface for the key profiler, which is the screen on which you program the keys, it's really simple to program all of the keys. You don't have to script if you don't want to. Also, you can light up the board in any color your heart desires on a color grid which makes it perfect for gaming in the dark and you can have it whatever color you please. The different applications on the display are quite handy. I read the news all the time, haha. It also has a performance monitor, which tells you CPU and RAM usage, a clock which tells you the time (duh) and date, and a stopwatch/countdown app which I find quite handy at times, among others. At first, looking at the picture online, I thought that the little bump for the arm rest would be a circulation cutting nuisance, but it's great, I put the bottom of my hand on the backside of the bump and my fingers reach the keys very comfortably. (My hands are 7&#34; from the bottom to the tip of my middle finger, if that helps.) As for the joystick, I haven't found a necessary use for it yet. With the proper setup of keys, you could certainly use it without trouble of reaching other controls. If you want the joystick to change your view in a first person game such as Halo, it is much easier to do with the Windows 8 software/interface which you may download fairly easily from the Logitech site on the G13's page. The board itself is a stone, it doesn't move as long as it's on a smooth surface or something like a couch/carpet. Oh, and it says that you may have three modes, one for each set of controls. It's a beautiful feature, plus each mode has its own color. Plus, you may store like six profiles on the board, each containing three modes, so in reality, you have 18 modes. You just have to open the key profiler real quick to load a profile, takes seconds. I highly recommend this product, thing's class. I hope this review was helpful!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I love the book thanks for asking.amazon is a great website. i am in the middle of it (life of pi)

1401322786|5.0|This story keeps your attention and reads like a movie script.  Loved it.  Would like to see it made into a movie.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I love this game. I can play for hours, and have fun when I'm bored. But, I've noticed popup adds. A lot. Like every five minutes. And this is only after I spent money on diamonds. I feel like because of the adds, and how long it can take to load, and how separate horses have the same amount of energy, making buying new horses pointless, this app should get three stars.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is great and kept me reading tell 10 reading it. It is also great for kids to read and will have a blast reading it.
B00A757EFW|1.0|The controls are not responsive on the Kindle Fire.  You spend most of the time with eyes on the navigation because it doesn't respond...taking any enjoyment from the game.
B00005N6KG|5.0|You would not believe how many sets of head phones and ear buds I have tried for portable items without a good fit - until now.  Ear buds don't fit correctly on me, nor do other \\"light weight\\" head phones.  I have worn these doing a variety of things and was especially impressed with how well they stayed in place when at the gym. You can actually forget you have these on because of the fit and their very light weight.  I can only assume the fact they are vertical and in-ear helps a lot. Should you need a great, super light weight pair of head phones you'll like these! A cord a foot longer would be bliss but I cannot reduce my rating because of that.
0765316994|3.0|For a while it goes exactly where you think it will go, then somewhere around the 3rd act it takes a divisive turn that some will like and some won't.
159448385X|5.0|This book is worth more than five stars.. I was extremely engulfed in the story from the first page until the last... I was taken through a range of emotions that will make me forever remember this book. I highly recommend it AND the first book written by this author called The Kite Runner... you wont be disappointed.

0670024813|4.0|The era of modern societies makes up only a tiny fraction of human history. To understand how humans interacted for most of history it is essential to understand traditional societies. In the last century some of the last traditional societies that have been untouched by modern societies, e.g. in Papa New Guinea, were contacted and often transformed by modern societies. In The World Until Yesterday Jared Diamond examines and contrasts traditional societies with modern societies.<br /><br />The book's sections touch on conflict resolution, warfare, child-raising practices, religion, treatment of the elderly, handling risk, the effects of multilingual environments, and diet in traditional and modern societies. Diamond does not idealize traditional societies' practices nor immediately dismiss them either. For example, in his conflict resolution section Diamond highlights the priority of relationship repair in traditional societies that is missing from the formal court cases handled by third-party intermediaries like attorneys in modern societies. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel.  His Collapse was only so-so.  I give The World Until Yesterday 4 Stars for readers who are already predisposed to enjoying anthropology. If you aren't a fan its 512 pages will seem too long.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app keeps the kids busy and they love it.  It has a sense of really taking care of something.  A+++++
B000V8MQZI|4.0|Great album - one you can listen to the whole way through.  Grohl is amazing as usual, but not to be overlooked is the strong and interesting drumming but Taylor Hawkins.  Perfect listen for vinyl too.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|It was not what I was looking for so I really didn't use this app. Might have been a good app, just wasn't what I was wanting
B002BI6SMI|2.0|The movie is great, but the audio on the instant video version of the film is just terrible!<br />Does anyone actually listen to this stuff before they put it up?
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I love this series.  It's well scripted, acted and produced.  The cast is excellent.  I highly recommend this show to anyone into series like The Godfather, The Sopranos or The Untouchables.  You will not regret it.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My son loves this and that's what matters! We were given a wind-up mobile at our shower and although I was reluctant to use it, my son immediately took to it and it made naptime a breeze! However, going in his room every 5 minutes to wind it up was getting to be a nuisance. Found this one and although I was looking for black and white, the animals eyes are contrast enough. Great music choices, great motion, great running time (I usually start it once and he's out), night light is dim, but I don't use it anyway. Remote control is nice, but eats batteries way faster than the mobile itself. Awesome product!!
0789325772|5.0|Better than as advertised. Cream- colored, thick paper, vintage drawings on each month as well as on the days pages. Would order again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Terrific for short &#34;time-fillers.&#34;  You get all of the interactive fun and solitude of playing this card game, without having to handle the cards, shuffle, etc.  Two thumbs up!
B00138J234|5.0|Springs from the heart of punk and plants with authority the seeds for alternative, new wave, alt-country, and all avant-garde and wanna-be rock-and-roll that would follow.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I heard a couple of these songs before buying the full MP3 album, and I really like their style.  I've heard and read interviews with them and they really care about their fans, too.  Some Nights is really great - the full complement of lyrics, music and story.  And who hasn't heard We Are Young over and over - and not gotten sick of it!  A good, enjoyable new band.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game and spend sometimes too much time enjoying it and listening to the instrumental songs that go with it.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I have this concert in double-disk DVD set and it defnitely is one of the greatest concert DVDs I have ever seen. I have been waiting for it to come out on blu-ray, however, the product description for this blu-rayset, due to come out in Feb. 2013, notes the aspect ratio to be 1.33:1. I am hoping this is a typo.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The lost hero is one of my favorite books I can't wait to read book 2 the son of Neptune
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I should say that I am not and have never been really a gamer.  I enjoyed this book - I like books about dystopian futures and smart protagonists.  But some of the plot twists weren't very creative, the bad guys were pretty cardboard, and at times the solutions felt too easy. I gave it four stars because it was a fast and fun read.  It's not for everyone though.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Funny, smart, and full of space. This was an absolute joy to read. I salute the author and recommend this to anyone that has even a passing interest in space or sci-fi. Do yourself a favor and read this.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I can't get too excited about this game.  It is not like I need to use my brain as much
B0015DROBO|4.0|Having seen the film adaptations, I was familiar with the story, but am pleased to have read the books. The story and the characters are engrossing. I found it hard to put down.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It's so crazy that it makes my stomach hurt. Other than that the only thing that irritates me is if I'm doing really well, the game will just shut off!
B003JUGQ38|4.0|Donna is my favorite companion and somehow I had missed this episode. I was happy to be able to get it via unbox - easy and quick to download.  It's not one of the best of the season but it's still very good and worth a watch.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I love the game but when I die sometimes I click on &quot;save me&quot; and it will take me back to my kindle homescreen and give me a -1 or even -2 gems. frustrating glitches!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|IT WAS GREAT ,AND NOT THE ENDING I WAS EXPECTING, KEEPS YOU GUESSING , I'M NOW READING<br />  NAKED HEAT, IT ALSO HELPS THAT I LOVE THE SHOW.
B009KY0UCK|5.0|This a fantastic song by a fantastic artist. This song won a Golden Globe. The vinyl sounds really good on my system. It is too bad that this song was not included on the Skyfall soundtrack album.
B000OVLINI|4.0|The Shadow of the Wind was very long and twisty.  The  shadow of the wind was a good read. It held my attention
B007A2O3FO|5.0|If you enjoy Maggie Smith's work, you will enjoy this movie. She is the master and doesn't disappoint in this movie.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|The game is a good mix of strategy and action and will keep you entertained and Will still be a challenge for you
B00B2V66VS|2.0|When ever I try to use a gem for the second time in a run, it closes the app,  and the I'm -3 gems!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|For my zombie books, I guess I'm more of an action-oriented guy. This focused so extensively on the societal impact of the zombie apocalypse that I completely lost interest in the book. I want action and suspense and fast-paced story development. This book was just so slow and blah. I found that I actually started skipping paragraphs just so that I could get to the end as quickly as possible.
1250027624|5.0|Every Downton Abbey should have this. Great photos and inside information. Don't hesitate. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy every page!!!!!!
1861085257|4.0|I made the hamburg earrings and sold several pair to my friends. Then made watermelon earrings and hamburgs and sold at local Flea Market......... did well....... The banana should have a thin layer of white inside the peel....... like it a lot. This gets the imagination going! Do it!
0765325950|5.0|robert jordan who unfortunately died before he finished the wheel of time series was one of the greatest writers of our time.few besides tolkien,brooks,herbert,goldkind,and mckiernan could produce a world where you feel a part of.this is the fiinal edition to the series that was finished by friend sanderson
B006LSZECO|3.0|Let me start by saying, don't let my 3 stars completely defer you from this book.  I in fact enjoyed reading it!  Let me also say I am not some literary snob or anything like that.  I'm educated but I read for fun, not to pick apart these books.  I'll give you a review from just your average person who enjoys reading, so here we go.<br /><br />Alright at the beginning of the book, chances are you will LOVE Nick and Amy.  They seem to have it all- happiness, love, great jobs, money, friends, everything our imaginations could want.  They seem very much in love and in tune with each other.  So then after Nick loses his job, he becomes easier to detach from especially because as the reader, during Amy's part you feel compelled to sympathize with her that she is still trying to love him unconditionally while he goes through this time.  Then the game-changer when they have to move back because of Nick's sick mother.<br /><br />So, Amy disappears and you find out some things about Nick that will make you hate him but you empathize with him because the cops and the media all start pointing the finger at him.  This is realistic with what what happens in real life, though as the plot thickens, it becomes hard to EVER imagine this happening but it makes for fun reading.<br /><br />Which brings me to my final point- as the plot twists and turns this book does become incredibly exciting to read.  As a former psychology major I was FLOORED by Amy's twisted take on 'justice', as you will be.  So here I was nearing the end of this book, loving it, thought &#34;oh wow this is gonna end great I can't wait.. (spoilers would go here)&#34;.. and then......nothing.  This whole book was so fun to read and the end was a massive let down.  I was so upset that the ending was VERY lackluster, and just didn't seem to fit.  I don't know if it was because there is supposed to be a sequel or what, but that''s why I gave it the 3 stars instead of five.  There was just no sense of justice, or conflict resolution at the end which just for me as a personal preference I like to read at the end of books.<br /><br />I would recommend this book as a fun, easy read.  I read it all in a few hours on my kindle.  However, you may find yourself like me, scratching your head at the end, yelling &#34;WHYYYY?!?!&#34;
0451232852|3.0|I mistakenly ordered the book instead of the Kindle Edition.  Although you told me to keep it instead of returning it for a refund, I am going to have to order the Kindle Edition to read it as the print in the book is small and that makes it difficult for me to read. I only gave it three stars because I hadn't read it and had to give it something to fill out the review form.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|This is well done sci fi war. The only problem I saw was uniform types for US soldiers. The feelings shown were realistic to the situation.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great app!!! the competitions are easy to win u can have multiple horses and u can get unicorns and zebras (for a lot of gems though) great app!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is amazing!!!!!!!! I really like it. there is a monkey and it is huge!!! if anyone thinks this game is crap then something is wrong with your brain.!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|challenging and fun all in one.  just wicks once you really get into you have to buy the rest :( other than its pretty cool
B000T00PE2|5.0|:) chill music to listen to while driving or studying... had to cd a while back and lost it, glad to have the album again.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Highly recommend this movie. It is one of my favorites on the list. There's a patriotic element to it. The director does an excellent job portraying the time period
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run 2 is a good squell with unique and exciting gameplay. This game used to crash a lot, but it seems to be fixed.<br /><br />Now I've had another issue with this. I opened the app to see all 23 of my gems were gone, I was a level lower than I was previously, and old missions I had already completed were 'new'. Odd. I don't recall doing anything that would have caused this.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|It took me awhile to figure out how to install it, but It's perfect for me use on the road as a published author.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Very thought provoking. Don't appreciate being told how many words to use. Don't think I' 'll be giving any more reviews.
0307454541|1.0|I was so excited when I purchased this book and had high expectations. Not only was it difficult to read, but very boring.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is Fun To play its better than the 1st version And has Different equalies than the 1st one If you download havee funn

0938045768|5.0|First I ordered the digital copy for my ipad, but then I ordered the softcover since I carried it to the gym with me. I really don't lift weights any more.  The bodyweight approaches suite my mud / obstacle racing needs better that weightlifting... Definitely a great book!
B00867GKIK|5.0|Great movie for all the family. Customer service was very good. Product got here in time for our Christmas. Very pleased.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|The reason I don not like it is that I did not find the simple verson that is on my laptop,  This HD is hard on my eyes and hard to follow.  I wish i could find the old version.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is amazing!  there is always something happening, there is never a dull moment. if you are looking for an action packed book then you've  got it. i loved this  book so much that i read it at least 5 times. the book mixes action with romance and it  perfects the book
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Just in three books (not including his other series) he has created a piece  of art! Just at age eleven (younger than Percy in Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief), I was practically addicted to his books! He was my last reason to become an author myself. Thanks!
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|pretty small screen but still fun to play my granddaughteris getting a lot better than i am playing the game!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Who doesn't like Facebook, it is a great way to keep up wtih friends and family although some people put alittle to  much privaate things for the world to read, that's alittle to much info and not necessary.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I really do recommend this app to everybody..it lets you take pictures from facebook and the enternet and you can upload them to facebook and twitter..install it today
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Never bored by playing. Time goes by real quick. Fun trying be beat your own score. Have this game under my favorites.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this is the best game its for all ages and soo fun I honestly love this game woo stop listening to me and play the game
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book, I think it's the best book in the world. I think that every young adult should read this book. I am only 13yrs old and I really connected with this book. He is just like me, but a boy and older. I think everyone should read this book. I think it would help you make you feel better about yourself<br /> That's what this book for me.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little guy is amazing! I didnt thing that this type of sharpener would really work out for some of the blades that i have...but it does. for the preice this thing is so good and puts a super sharp edge on very quickly
B009R8DJ72|5.0|I'm sad because i finish reading the book so fast that I never really remember what the book is about<br />But I still love it
B00280LYIM|5.0|Love this book! It is action packed! I won't say any more because I don't want to give it away.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|This is a great way to find people in your area.It's really easy to use as well.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for friend,chat and even dating.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Its no secret that this was a great movie. Christopher Nolan's final chapter in the Dark Knight trilogy  has nods to classic Batman tales, as well as A Tale of Two Cities. Kids might find the action too intense but this is a fantastic movie. My only qualm is that I would rather have an Amazon digital copy as opposed to the Ultra-Violet. It is my understanding though that the Ultra-violet copy can be traded for an iTunes copy.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Além de ser um dos melhores livros que li nos últimos anos, há passagens engraçadíssimas. Eu realmente gostaria de ler outros livros do Andy Weir. Recomendo.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|By far one of the best scavenger hunts I've been on in a while. Easy to pick up and figure out without any head aches. Great job G5. Runs smooth on the Kindle Fire. DL now
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is a very cute game and I love it. Ok great game. Right this minute I see a lot of  everywhere. I just think this is very cute.
1401201911|5.0|What is Superman's rocket landed in Russia? 'What if..?' questions are common for comic book fans, and this book is the highest quality of answer. In lesser hands, this story would have had the origins of DC superheroes cut and paste into Soviet Russia. Mark Millar took a different route. He remains true to the characters, but makes the story truly unique. Full of nods to Superman's rich history, even non-comic fans will find this to be an interesting tale.  An essential component of any Superman or history buff's library.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Didn't watch this until after I saw a few episodes of the MTV show. I found it very interesting and well done.
B003L77G2Y|3.0|The third season, like the start of the third act of a three-act play, really gets into the meat of the story and offers plenty of twists and turns.  Sadly the video quality on the all the &#34;Fringe&#34; DVDs is not as good as other series I've seen.  (The &#34;CSI&#34; DVD boxes look almost as good as the HD broadcasts if you have a decent up-converting DVD player.)  These discs sometimes go blocky and pixelated, looking almost like video streamed over a low bandwidth network connection.  I ended up replacing all four seasons with the Blu Ray releases (which also include a few extra features not found on the DVDs.) This is the first time I have ever rebought a TV series on BD, but I think &#34;Fringe&#34; is worth it.  (I also bought each season when I could get the best deals, either here at Amazon or at TheWBStore.com, which currently has S1, S2 and S4 for $21.49 each with free shipping.  S3 was sold out, last I looked.)  But if DVD is your only option and you can get them on sale, the story and the acting more than make up for the image quality issues.  I'm going to give my DVD sets to a friend I'm trying to get hooked on the show.
0525953590|5.0|Very detailed easy to read explanation of what's happening around us all from the macro cosim to the micro cosim
B00B2V66VS|5.0|to be honest i used to be obsessed with temple run but after unlocking everything i deleted it. Temple run 2 is well needed app at th right time! Congrats Imangi Studios!!!Keep it coming!
B0076DELIG|4.0|One of Michael Connelly's better. Keeps you going back to read some more. A little sex would have been nice though.
B000KF0NI4|4.0|Good family cartoon. Video showed nice detail, audio was decent, and story was humorous.<br /><br />The extras were good but cartoon shorts would have put over top if they were in HD.
B009DH2PP4|1.0|This review is on the format, not the contents.<br /><br />While the author's text is widely regarded as one of the best available guides or introductions to homebrewing, this book is a disaster in Kindle format. The links to illustrations invariably do not work, and there is no table of contents to help guide the reader. Kindle works well for books that are flat text, but not a how-to manual like this where the reader will often refer back to certain parts of the text, but not necessarily read in a linear fashion. I wish I could return this for a refund, but Amazon doesn't give me the option to do so. Avoid this book in the Kindle format and buy the print version instead.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is great because it gives you so many different sounds to choose from.... The sound quality is very good. I have enjoyed listening to the different sounds. There is something for everyone!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Perfect blend of strategy and mapping.  Hints are not giveaways, awesome graphics, great puzzles.  Could not wish for better designed game.  Wish there were more like it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing- this book was one that I absolutely could not put down, and didn't, reading beginning to end in one evening. Not only is it a love story, but such a beautifully written life story.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book which takes place in the post revolutionary south is an interesting look at slavery from both sides through the eyes of a white child who grows up among the slaves and what happens as she grows and becomes an adult that must now live among the whites and is expected to abandon her black family.  The highs and lows of her slave family and the family she was indentured to are explored here.  The story catches your interest from the beginning and takes you on the roller-coaster life that was Vinnia's.
B005CWRB44|2.0|At first glance it seems like it would be the perfect keychain light, but there are several glaring flaws that ultimately forced me to return it.<br /><br />1. You have to unscrew the head more than half way off for the light to actually turn off. Any less and pressing the head can cause the light to turn on (this is caused by the lack of a sprung battery compartment). The light has come apart a few times in my pocket because of this.<br />2. As a consequence of (1), I *highly* doubt the waterproof claim holds when the light is in the off position (while on, there is indeed a tight seal). Seeing as the light will spend most of its time off (and vulnerable to foreign matter and water), I don't think I can trust the waterproof claim.<br />3. The battery compartment lacks a spring. This causes uneven contact between the battery and head which is noticeable when you try to turn on the light/change modes: the battery can bounce around just enough to make and break contact multiple times, thus cycling the mode. Very frustrating.<br /><br />This was a very disappointing purchase coming from the PD32 (my first Fenix light, which is just 100% perfect). That will not discourage me from buying Fenix again - I'll just have to stay away from their twisty switches.<br /><br />Suggestion for Fenix: Implement a twisty switch the way the Maglite Solitaire does it. When the switch is twisted close, the light is OFF. To turn ON the light, you untwist the head. (So, the opposite of what it is now)
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I really like this app. The quality of the various sounds is very good, and the choices of sounds is excellent. I had never heard of brown noise, blue noise, and some of the other options that are available. I think anyone can find something to suit their need to relax and allow their body to drift into sleep. I find I sleep better and deeper with this product playing in the background.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It was interesting enough that I wanted to know the outcome and finish it. On the other hand, I was glad when it was over. It was a shallow story overall and I'm not sure what I think about the writing style using repetition.
0140449337|5.0|This is a classic of Stoic philosophy, and it is quite close to Buddhism in its insistence on renouncing the pleasures and pains of the world.  It is interesting reading -- up to a point.<br /><br />Just as a thought experiment: if you invited Marcus to a Thanksgiving dinner, would he participate happily in the feast?  Or would he confine himself to a few slices of white meat, with a dour expression showing his disapproval of the feasting idiots?  How would he conduct himself at a New Year's Eve party?<br /><br />Consider the idea that renouncing the world amounts to renouncing life, and that this is no solution at all for the mass of men.  More than that, the Stoic renunciation brings no obvious reward (other than moral perfection and, perhaps, a reputation as a prig), while the Buddhist renunciation at least offers the hope of Nirvana.<br /><br />For the average man, it seems quite enough to live a good life and enjoy the pleasures of life when they are available.  In fact, the Jewish tradition explicitly condemns those people who only eat a few slices of white meat during a Thanksgiving feast.
0374214913|5.0|in this smart, funny, fun to read book.It includes quirky, eccentric characters who raise a whole host of ideas/questions about life including those about perspective, reality, and duty with a dash of magical realism thrown in.
B00A12VW86|5.0|This album is loaded with so many hooks that you'll be hard-pressed to pick your favorite. I love Dos! and Tre! too, but this is my fave of the three.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Kindle Fire HD doesn't support flash.  It should qualify this in its description before I waste my time and efforts downloading it.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|This Kindle Fire Zip Sleeve ismade to fit perfectly.  It has everything you would need to protect your Kindle Fire.  I would suggest that with a big purchase like a Kindle Fire protection is needed for your investment.
B00008PX8P|5.0|If you like Led Zeppelin at all, you will love this DVD set. I've been a fan almost my whole life and watching this film makes me feel as if I am experiencing Led Zeppelin for the first time. The Dansmark Radio piece and the Earls Court footage surprised me the most, but every second of this film is fantastic. Those boys were magnificent! Wow, wow, wow.
B0038VPB5W|5.0|I was excited about getting this CD and I'm very pleased with how fast it arrived. I appreciate the great service
B0086700CM|5.0|This game will pull you in and won't let you out!  You will want to keep playing to get farther and farther on the temple! Works great on my galaxy S3
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Once again, Kinney takes this to a new level in the best-selling series of, \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid.\\" . Kinney is the best author I've read so far (well, one of them, anyways).
B009E3EXMU|5.0|What an amazing pleasure to finally get to see this concert. I've watched it at least three times now and enjoy it more with each viewing. Jimmy's guitar is still unbelievable. Such great music! And they all obviously enjoyed performing. I'm so happy to have this DVD. All of it is good. I loved watching Robert knock Kashmir out of the park. Led Zeppelin...still great, still beautiful.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|Basically , I liked the Twilight Saga series movies , so I want to have the whole collection.. And I am happy :-)
B0015F1VY8|2.0|We never were able to finish the movie because the kept stopping to &#34;download&#34; and would get stuck. What we saw of it we liked.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This cover not  only protects my kindle, it helps me hold it for reading. With arthritis, even the light weight kindle can get hard to hold. Not with this case. It can prop it on a chair arm, table or tummy.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I needed this to catch up as I missed a few shows.  I watched all in 2 days, couldn't stop.  This a must see!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love horses so i like any game with them. But this one is realistic and fun. I like how the horses look real and move realistically. And how they have competitions and you control how they move.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its cool and all. but i think they couldve done better. like make the redstone ore mineable, place grass so hoes wont be wasted, put some lava in the ground, a few more mobs...mabye slimes or enderman..but wat do we expect? this is the app. Ill be so happy when the update comes for my kindle fire...you can see it on the minecraft forums.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|Another one of my very favorite movies. I love the fun, quirky characters, and the struggle and finally success to overcome obstacles.
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|This movie was just slapped together. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. I feel sorry for the animators, because I know they worked pretty hard on the project, but at least they got paid.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game it is way better then 1. the sounds and graphics are way better this game is awesome and free.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I use this app all the time mainly for backing up some of my data from my Kindle Fire to my computer. I have the aCar app for keeping my automobile data on and it backs up to Dropbox on my computer. My computer then backs up that data using Carbonite so it's like a double protection.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I thought is was a great movie. Any movie that I do not find myself fast forwarding to get through is a good movie. LOL<br />I enjoyed it !
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Another fun game to play to take up idle time.  All my friends stopped playing though, so I haven't played in a while.  Lots of great color schemes to choose from to make your drawings with and interacts with Facebook so you can invite your friends.
B002HNA95E|5.0|I'm amazed at just how many hits and singles that are included in this album, and with few exceptions, these are the long-play album versions - not the radio edits. The songs are organized beautifully. From her early works to her newer ones and back again; kudos to Madonna and her crew for the well-blended tempo. The remaster quality of the earlier tracks (Who's that Girl, Holiday, Dress You Up and others) sound clean and robust with very little hiss and white noise. The bass, treble and vocals are in perfect balance and complement the newer recordings nicely. As another person commented, though, \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" is strangely absent (among others great songs). It would have been an excellent addition, especially to the first half of disc 2, which emphasizes some of Madonna's more ambient works and romantic ballads. But, for $12, this is still a very nice collection.aises the price.
B001JI72AI|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this again. The movie is a lot of fun. Tom Hanks is amazing! Can't imagine being stuck up in outer space in a tin can like that.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this simplistic app, it's pretty fun and the graphics are excellent. It's not completely realistic, but interesting. The only problem is the size of the app. You need a lot of space to operate it, and it shuts down every once in a while. If you like horses and have the space, I say it's worth it!
B0034G4P8A|3.0|Was not close enough to the old Thor to me, they should have made it a lot like the comic book Thor.
B000AP04OM|5.0|We would recommend this to anyone interested in the movie. It has extras which were very interesting to watch.<br /><br />Enjoy
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Had to read for class. This book has been recommended to me by no fewer than a half dozen people. It lives up to the hype.
B007XHWROK|5.0|Great Item will be Gifted at CHRISTmas this Year.............& God Bless Have a Blessed Holiday season and a safe & Happy New Year!!!!
B0015AARJI|1.0|Well mine broke after about a month and now the controls dont work so it was a waste of $40.00 but I might hav had a defect but I wil say it was fun while it lasted.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The epilogue was truly a beautiful ending... I think it could have explained more of what happened to haymitch as time went on though...
B002C949KE|5.0|Very enjoyable read. Great stories are given as examples of marketing situations. Book is a little absolute, but excellent book overall.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Excellent!  I enjoyed every chapter, well written, action packed.. I highly recommend!  You'll be hooked on Jack Reacher, like me...
B004IFD9HE|4.0|Not one of Sandlers best.  He is an inch away from just doing his deerrp type character.  It has some heart and some funny moments that my kids ( 7 & 5) liked. I honestly would not have purchased this except the kids wanted to watch it again and two rentals would have been silly.
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|do not under any circumstances order this app, I was never able to put in my destination. glad it was free.
B008WOULPK|5.0|I love photography.<br /><br />GQ, Vogue, and Vanity Fair are the magazines that I look through for inspiration and ideas. I noticed that; when it came to the Vogue editorials, the fashion editor of my absolute favorite editorials were Grace Coddington. I have never picked up a auto-biographical book that school had not forced me to read. This one is great because it has given me an insight to one piece of the editorial process. I am not a speed reader, but I have had this book for about a week and am more than half way through it. I am really glad that I bought this book.<br /><br />I believe that for anyone that saw The September Issue movie, will appreciate this book greatly. Ms Coddington was the standout in the movie and reading this book feels as if she is telling you her story as oppose to you reading about it.<br /><br />I hope this little review helps you out.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Surprising but enjoyable ending to a very good trilogy. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this and would recommend it to any of my friends to read.
0061122416|5.0|It came in good condition and I love reading this book. I recommend it to everybody who needs spiritual awakening.

B0084TWN9K|1.0|I would not recommend this to anyone. Sorry I purchased it.  The last stories were better than the beginning of the book. The start was a tough read.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I've tried other Kindle dictionaries and the Merriam Webster version is great, and easy to use! (Great help for &#34;Words&#34;)
B004EPZ06G|5.0|Love this move... Just had to buy it for myself. Great classic movie of great stars. I laughed a lot in this movie
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Exciting, a page turner. Writing from several points of view, Sparks takes the reader on a wild ride through the mind of a deranged alcoholic, the woman he batters, and the man she loves.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed the book, eye opening.  The writer makes it difficult to put the book down. Excellent writer who knows how to keep your attention.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Very quick read and extremely inciteful given the ages of the main characters. I was surprised that i felt connected to the characters because I'm 50 and they are in Highschool.  The writer touched on real issues and peer pressures of our teens and i loved the twist at the end! I hope there's a sequel.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This was a good movie to watch... It kept you engaged and hopping for the next best thing. I really enjoyed it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I never seen this show before and started to watch the first season because of Amazon Prime ~ Then was hooked!  I purchased the second season as it was already in progress on TV and I didn't want to just jump in.  I was a bit disappointed when it was not a continuation of the first season BUT soon was hooked again.  Very scary show!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|An enlightening read. Once you start the book, you will not put it down till you finish it.  Good writer.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Book 1 of The Hunger Trilogy is sensationally, original, creative and compelling reading.<br /><br />Books 2 and 3 are a repetition largely of the same thing without adding much value, disappointing.
1401310672|5.0|This is funny to read from front cover to back. I laughed all the way through this book and found similar situations.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|It's great being able to order anything you want whenever you want.  I also really like knowing that I can check the status of an order whenever I need to do so.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is so addictive. it is so fun and the characters are sick nasty!!! well when you die it is not fun! have a blast.

B00005JM02|5.0|I love this classic movie. I wanted it for my collection so I could watch it many times myself as an adult.
1601251556|2.0|This map is very stiff. The packaging makes the product very small and difficult to unfold. Then there are large seams in the map that won't quite lay down due to the map's thickness. Its cheap and feels that way. Try something better-
B002QS1O36|5.0|This story was originally published as a novel called \\"Le fantôme de l'Op&eacute;ra\\" by Gaston Leroux in 1911,and it has since been adapted several times into plays and movies such as Rupert Julian's horror version in 1925.  But none can compare to (in my opinion) Gerard Butler's performance as the Phantom or for that matter, Emmy Rossum's performance as Christine Daae.  I don't care if your not a huge fan of musicals, you should make this one the exception.<br />I've seen this movie probably a hundred times and I still get goose bumps every time I watch it, and I don't think<br />I will ever tire of this movie, with the awesome story line and the superb music.<br />It's a really good buy, so trust me if you buy this movie you will not be disappointed.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Love the convenience of just being able catch up on episodes at my convenience.  Enjoy that Amazon makes the episodes available quickly.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Love this move... Just had to buy it for myself. Great classic movie of a great star Michael Jackson. Enjoy
B00B2V66VS|3.0|it a cool game but I don't like the fact that you lose you coins. that's pretty stupid because then you don't and cant get anywhere.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a real equestrian lover, and while it is not as great as a real horse, it suffices. Another app that may get tiring after awhile, however I just enjoy looking at them.

B0055OK2T0|5.0|I recommend this movie - one I did not know about and I love Matt Damon and especially EMily Blunt! It was a great movie for the whole family - being I have son's who love anything science fiction or time travel and this was its own take on TIME. I loved the suspense and the story of their bond and their lives kept crossing.<br /><br />Definitely a great movie.

B000001GQY|5.0|Brahms's music always resonates.  It's likely because that, beneath that rigid structure of his music, one can always sense the emotional turbulence the man was going through.<br /><br />That said, I don't think his 2nd concerto is by any means an easily accessible piece. It's a well structured piece and at times I've heard people comment that this piece is somewhat boring. I guess the comment does make some sense given that the melody is never as obvious as, let's say, Rach 2 or Tchaikovsky 6.<br /><br />Personally, I was hooked by the Gilels/Jochum's performance the first time I listened to it, and I have since listened to nearly all other Brahms 2 recording available.  In each recording there are elements I can appreciate, but only Gilels brings out the emotion like a thunderstorm in the first movement, which in turn contrasts with the unparallelled tranquility in the second.<br /><br />I hate to say there is a definitive interpretation on any given piece, because interpretation of classical music is meant to be versatile and personal.  But this is the only Brahms 2 I can seriously listen to, even for the 100th time.

B004J4WKUQ|4.0|\\"Ready Player One\\" was a lot of fun for me because I grew up during the 80s and 90s and could relate to most of the inside jokes. (There were, for me, many laugh out loud moments, especially the Karate Kid reference. I had to stop for a few minutes after that one.) I have to admit that while I thought I was a video game \\"geek\\" back then, Cline proved me wrong as there was much nostalgia that I didn't even recall. I was more of a Nintendo freak, obsessed with games like Zelda, Metroid, and Super Mario Brothers. I could remember sitting for days and days with friends while we tried desperately to figure the puzzles in Zelda, and the elation that would follow once we did. That's how this book felt. It was like you're a kid again, inside a video game, and you're figuring it all out as Wade Watts, the protagonist, is figuring it out.<br /><br />The premise of \\"Ready Player One\\" reminded me A LOT of a movie I enjoyed as a child called, \\"The Wizard.\\" The description for \\"The Wizard\\" on IMDB is, \\"A boy and his brother run away from home and hitch cross country with the help of a girl they meet to compete in the ultimate video game championship.\\" Sound familiar? \\"The Wizard,\\" incidentally, was released in 1989 and Cline mentioned every possible eighties pop culture item except for it (unless I missed the reference, which is possible.) I can't say for sure if this old-school Fred Savage movie served as inspiration for this book, but it wouldn't surprise me. That movie lacked the futuristic aspects of this novel, including a dark, dystopian picture of America in the future. Certainly, I hope this vision that Mr. Cline gives us through Wade Watts isn't what awaits: it would be sad if humanity reached the day when our escape from reality wasn't in a good book, or film, or locale such as mountains in Chile or museums in France, but instead was some sort of dream world concocted by geeks in laboratories. It would be worse still if our own actions--carbon dioxide emissions, and rampant pollution--contributes to said dystopia.<br /><br />The bottom line: RPO is a YA-ish fantasy book. If you can suspend disbelief, want to reminisce about the 1980s, want to escape to a dream world where you're inside a video game, then this book is for you!<br /><br />-Raeden Zenlution--contributes to said dystopia.

B009KHCT94|1.0|I'm all for black comedy, tongue in cheek comedy, maybe some general foolishness, but I couldn't sit through it  Example: About 25 minutes in the black astronaut is turned white by the Nazis and is sent back to earth.  He goes into a black neighborhood and acts Black BECAUSE HE DOESN'T REALIZE HE'S BEEN TURNED WHITE.  AH TRUE COMIC GENIUS! WHAT COMEDY! WHAT A BRILLIANT SENDUP ON THE HUMAN CONDITION AND RACE RELATIONS! HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA  Maybe this would have been funny when I was in 7th grade, not so much now.  On second thought, it wouldn't have been funny then either.  I rented this because I was home injured and didn't have anything better to do, and in the 3 days of the rental I couldn't bring myself to watch any more  Maybe it got better later on, but I wouldn't waste your money to find out
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My nine yo highly recommends this one.  She finds it adorable and fun.  Also a free app- can't beat that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game much better than the first one. It is more fun than game 1.I would get it if I played it on another Kindle.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|If you ever played the carny game with nickels or quarters or tokens (yuk!) you know how addictive this game is. I wish the coin regeneration limit was higher or quicker to start but I am trying to be patient. Maybe it is better that it isn't -- I might play for hours instead of minutes!!!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This show is great. Very suspenseful. I found the characters to be intriguing as well. I liked Dale, T-Dog and Glenn.

B000002MU3|3.0|I'll be honest: this is my least-favorite R.E.M. album. That being said, I still like it and there are some killer tracks that keep me coming back to it. It was nice to see the band try something unexpected and go with a heavier sound this time around; the problem is that it never feels as confident or coherent as you hope it will. The band sounds like they're trying to find their footing and aren't entirely comfortable with the new territory they're exploring, causing the record to jump from excellent to passable very quickly.<br /><br />Obviously the opener \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" gets a thumbs up. It's just irresistible and manages to do everything right. Likewise, tracks like \\"Circus Envy\\", \\"Star 69\\", and \\"I Took Your Name\\" are all fun and melodic in their own right. These moments are when Monster truly shines and you get a glimpse of the potential this album had. Then there are tracks like \\"Let Me In\\", \\"Crush with Eyeliner\\", and \\"King of Comedy\\", which are decent but fairly forgettable and pass by without leaving a solid impression. In the end that's the biggest gripe I have with this record. It's not necessarily that the songs themselves are poor but rather that they're arranged and recorded in such a mundane fashion. Sure, there's a lot of distortion and dissonance but it's not enough to make the songs interesting. Unless you're a band like Sonic Youth, who's able to get away with noise experiments and random guitar tunings, it comes off sounding uneven and unnecessary. The band just never sounds comfortable or sure of themselves, which is all the more puzzling given their track record.<br /><br />What's most interesting is that the two ballads on this album are actually the standouts. \\"Strange Currencies\\" sounds like a reworking of \\"Everybody Hurts\\" but it manages to add a bit more energy into the mix without going overboard. The hypnotic (and somewhat creepy) \\"Tongue\\" is gorgeous, complete with Michael Stipe's gentle falsetto wooing you into a sense of comfort despite the song's disturbing lyrics. In fact, this is one area where Monster is so fascinating. The music is fun and noisy, yet the lyrics are much darker and more twisted, leaving the listener to investigate what's really going on. It took me a while to realize this and it makes the album's shortcomings easier to overlook when you realize that the constant high volume of the music is a disguise for some unpleasant stories and depressing looks at society and celebrity culture.<br /><br />This seems to be one of the most contested works in the band's discography, with some fans praising it as one of R.E.M.'s best works and others condemning it as a throwaway album with no redeeming qualities. Personally, I'm in the middle. I find it to be their weakest album but that hardly relegates it to sitting on the shelf untouched. Half of the album is stellar and the other half, while nothing terribly special, is fun to listen to now and again. Later albums like Accelerate would fine-tune this sound and harness its power much more proficiently, leaving Monster as an interesting stepping stone along the way.e of comfort despite the song's disturbing lyrics.

Truly relatable in everyday sense and its not just one the cancer stories where two people meet and fall in love or whatever, well it is in a literal sense, but it hits many other things than just that and it makes you think and its fascinating.

B0027MJU00|4.0|Very well written.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat trying to guess who the killer is. Must read.
B005FJ7DOM|3.0|Good story. Kinda dragged in spots though but it is definetely worth the rental. Thought it would have more action
B000008JUM|5.0|Really enjoy this CD ! Cole Porter wrote wonderful songs. Favorite track here is From This Moment On by Jimmy Somerville. Very  artistic and always good.

1612183956|5.0|This books grabs you from page one and never let's go. It's an exciting mystery right up until the very end. Is the main character thrown into some government conspiracy?  Has he been transported to some alien planet?  Is he part of some bizarre experiment? Every conclusion  I came to about what was going on and why the people in this town acted so strangely ultimately had to be discarded. The writing is good, characters are solid and the plot is great. I literally did not want to put this book down. Crouch is a great writer when he hits it right (as he does in this book. He misses the mark though in &#34;Run.&#34; Skip it). Highly recommended reading.

B006LSZECO|2.0|327 people on the library waiting list! must be a damned good book right? no! I am glad i read it to see what all the fuss is about, but at the same time I wasted time that could have been spent on a real good read. The main characters are tapped and highly unbelievable.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book is really good.  I so love the way the author gives such insight into each character.  I did think that Chris & Emily were awfully mature for their age....most teenagers I know are not so private, secretive, loyal, etc. which didn't seem entirely believable, but still a great read.
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|I heard people say that this was a good movie it was just not advertised right. DONT BELIEVE IT! This one of the worst movies ever made. Horrible acting and just not a good movie. If you want to waste 3 doolars to rent this go ahead but it would probably be more worth it to throw your 3 dollars down the toilet than to rent this movie
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Even though I can't draw worth a flip, I love playing this game. It makes me laugh a lot.
B006BXT4TI|4.0|These guys really rock, and they've been around for years! I'm ashamed to say I'm from Ohio and i didn't start listening to them until 3 years ago. This CD is great, a must have for any fan.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|We love Downton Abbey, in fact we bought this episode because it was described as &#34;the original British version&#34;.  But instead of extra scenes, scenes were missing.  We also thought it would be Episode 3, (so far we had watched 1 & 2), and it was a repeat of Episode 2.  AND we had friends over for the &#34;big event&#34;'.  So there is definite confusion in the description of this show.  Amazon made it right, and support was very swift and excellent in helping me recover my password,  I've mentioned that to everyone I know,  no complaints there.  But we won't be buying any more episodes.
B008XFAT7S|4.0|Not in English so be warned but it was a good movie with alot of action worth the rental price to take a look
0062020889|4.0|This book is based on a true story of Israel hijacking at sea 200 tons of uranium. Here is the factual background:<br /><br />The following passage is from an unclassified US Airforce report on Israel's nuclear weaponry, available online. Link will be posted in the comments section at the end of this review.<br /><br />Title of article: THE THIRD TEMPLE'S HOLY OF HOLIES: ISRAEL'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS<br /><br />\\"After the 1967 war, France stopped supplies of uranium to Israel.  These supplies were from former French colonies of Gabon, Niger, and the Central Africa Republic.34  Israel had small amounts of uranium from Negev phosphate mines and had bought some from Argentina and South Africa, but not in the large quantities supplied by the French.  Through a complicated undercover operation, the Israelis obtained uranium oxide, known as yellow cake, held in a stockpile in Antwerp.  Using a West German front company and a high seas transfer from one ship to another in the Mediterranean, they obtained 200 tons of yellow cake.  The smugglers labeled the 560 sealed oil drums \\"Plumbat,\\" which means lead, hence \\"Operation Plumbat.\\"35  The West German government may have been involved directly but remained undercover to avoid antagonizing the Soviets or Arabs.36  Israeli intelligence information on the Nazi past of some West German officials may have provided the motivation.37\\"<br /><br />The plot seems to be speculatively filling in the details. It's not clear how much Follett really knows and how much is just imaginative filling in the blanks. The plotting is pretty dramatic, although I found the characters a bit wooden and superficial.<br /><br />The only plot flaws I detected were two highly unlikely coincidences that influenced the outcome in favor of the Israeli agent:<br /><br />1. The agent accidentally has coffee spilled on his shirt ruining a bug the KGB had planted on it.<br /><br />2. The agent's girlfriend returns home from 21 days of round the world stewardessing at the precise moment to overhear her father speaking with an Arab agent about killing her boyfriend, the Israeli agent. The two men do not notice her, and this sets in motion a complicated train of events in which she plays an instrumental role in saving his life and leading to the success of the operation.the precise moment to overhear her father speaking with an Arab agent about killing her boyfriend, the Israeli agent.

B004XIZK5K|2.0|The Kindle Edition does not have a functional Table of Contents.  This is a reference book.  The absence of a TOC makes it frustrating and slow to return to for pointers.

The major and sometimes unforgotten character is Downton Abbey itself. Thank you all for a wonderfully captivating story.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|Oh I think I am going top love this new line from Harlequin!! This was a great read from beginning to end!! I loved Megan and her forthright attitude. She was the perfect spunky match to Conner and his seriousness. Conner was just Alpha enough top keep my attention.<br /><br />It was a really sweet read and not my typical steamfest. That did not stop it from being a wonderful story. A very modern sort of marriage of convenience tale.<br /><br />I loved how she kept forgetting his name! It made me giggle a few times.<br /><br />In the end the expected drama leading up to a HEA! Sigh...Harlequin always did have a way of reeling me in to a nice cuddly romance!<br /><br />Cover Art - Cute, typical Harlequin. It is nice but not an eye catcher.<br /><br />*ARC courtesy of Carina Press via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*

0061120073|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an amazing novel, a kind of New York To Kill a Mockingbird. Beginning in 1912 but then flashing back to the early 1900s, it is the story of Francie Nolan, the daughter in a poor family. Her mother, Kate, is determined to get the best for her son, Neely, who is a year younger than Francie. Their father, Johnny, is handsome and funny and flamboyant, and also drinks way too much. And Francie loves to go the library. She's working her way through the books, from A to Z. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the story of the Rommely and the Nolan families' lives, centering on Francie. The title comes from a tree that grows in the yard.<br /><br />It's hard to pin-point what's so great about this novel. I read it 2 years ago, and loved it. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is less compelling than To Kill a Mockingbird, less deep, I guess you would say, but it's still a classic in its own right, and written much earlier. And it is pretty deep, whatever that actually means.<br /><br />Betty Smith brings to life the squalor and poverty of Brooklyn, New York, with her elegant prose. She creates wonderful, memorable characters and scenes. I loved reading about the various things that Francie and Neely did to earn a bit of candy money (though obviously, it was kind of sad), and reading about the various eccentricities of everyone in the neighborhood. You can certainly tell that Betty Smith was knowledgeable about Brooklyn; I'm pretty sure this book is based upon her own childhood at the turn of the century, and it shows. It feels realistic.<br /><br />I also loved the way that school was portrayed. A lot of the kids are awful to one another; even after they go through something, they tease other kids for having the same thing happen to them. The teachers ignore when the children need to use the bathroom, and bullying is rampant. And yet, there are moments of brightness: when the music teacher comes, when Sissy (Francie's aunt) intercedes for her. Francie actually really does like school.<br /><br />A thing I found interesting was that even though Manhattan isn't that far away, it seems so foreign to Francie, a whole other world that she can't even imagine.<br /><br />The characters were amazing. Katie, Johnny, Francie, Neely, Sissy...all of them and more felt realistic and were really fun to read about. Francie, particularly. She's an avid reader much like myself,  \\"on that day when she first knew she could read, she made a vow to read one book a day as long as she lived.\\" I can identify with that, and I would highly recommend A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.<br /><br />All of my reviews can be read at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com.

0060005696|1.0|This book is a poor excuse for academic thought. Instead of serious research, all he is doing is justifying his political beliefs. He starts with these beliefs and then tries to justify them over and over. For example, he pines for the days when there was one phone company and one phone. Well, in those days, long-distance phone calls cost $1/minute (the equivalent of $5/minute now), and hence only the wealthy could afford them. We all get frustrated when we have to book a plane, but would it be better to go back to the 1960's when again, only the wealthy could fly. The \\"choices\\" have made access to these products available to many more in our society.<br /><br />Another false tenet is that society should take away choice to \\"help\\" us. Who gets to decide this?? As if there is this intellectual body that \\"knows\\" what is better for you. Only a guilt-ridden person such as the author could actually think this way.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A wonderful game with personality and horses.<br />one thing I would like to see though is less expensive items.<br /><br />boo boo boo boo boo

THE SQUEAMISH SHOULD NOT WATCH THIS AS IT IS IN YOUR FACE WITH THE BLOOD AND VIOLENCE.... I LOVED THE MOVIE AND GIVE IT A FULL FIVE STAR RATING FOR OVER THE TOP GUNFIRE AND ACTION....THIS MOVIE MAKES STALLONE'S JUDGE DREDD PALE IN COMPARISON....BRUTAL AND UNRELENTING IN ITS PORTRAYAL OF THE FUTURE WHERE EVIL AND CRIME ARE OVERTAKING SOCIETY, JUST AS THEY ARE IN REAL LIFE NOW... HMMMMMM FOOD FOR THOUGHT... WISH THE BAD GUYS OF TODAY COULD BE EXECUTED ON THE SPOT,STARTING WITH THE AURORA COLORADO MOVIE THEATER SHOOTER..

B0001AVZA8|5.0|I love this movie. In truth, I would have chosen the doctor, nevertheless, I appreciate the premise. Diane Keaton shines, not only in her interpretation of the material, but as one of the very few Hollywood actors who has the courage to refuse plastic surgery.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|Awesome graphics and smooth play.  Difficult to follow the radar as it does not synch up like typical radar displays.  I like the game but after the fourth freeze up on the Kindle Fire have opted to remove the game.  I did use that as a judge for four stars, but that controls are a little difficult.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I wasn't sure that I would like this story when I picked it up but I was sucked in from the first page and immediately invested in the story.

0375842209|5.0|My high school juniors read I Am the Messenger by Zusak this fall and really loved the book, as I did. It has a lot of meat for discussion, and I love that it is about a believable 19-year-old and his struggles in life, but he is not a victim. He is searching for meaning in his life and does not let life trample over him. He gradually recognizes that he can make a difference, even if he is one average&#34;nobody&#34; in an indifferent world. That recognition is ultimately life affirming and inspiring to him and to the reader, and the ending has an amazing twist. Its uplifting theme about the power of one is what made me come back for The Book Thief, which is an equally inspiring and suspenseful tale involving a young girl living in Nazi Germany just prior to WWII. Once again, Zusak gives the story a twist by making his narrator the voice of death...yes death as he draws the reader into the frightening world of Hitler's deepening threat to Europe and the free world. This is one talented young author.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|As a huge baseball fan I really enjoyed this book.  A must read for a sports fan.  I have wanted to read Moneyball for a while and finally did and it did not disappoint.
B00122OC86|5.0|A very complete collection, and the audio quality of the remastered recordings is very good. I like that the censored versions have been restored.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|I'm still reading it but it's very good. It starts out a little slow like the first book but like the first book is packed with lots of adventure. It's a bit dark (which is how I like my fantasy) and definitely meant for adult readers, but it also has it light and comical moments. Great characters!!
B008JF8O9M|2.0|This app does not seem to be made to work on my Kindle Fire. When I tried to use it printed several pages of blanks. It not what I needed.

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I heard about this movie but until I watched it (for the first time), I had no idea just how absorbing it was.  It kept me sitting on the edge of my seat throughout the entire showing and I was never disappointed.  In fact, I’ve watched it numerous times and I always saw little things I missed the first time.  FABULOUS MOVIE!  They were the perfect actors for the parts.  I bought another DVD just in case I wear out the first one.  I just can't wait to see the sequels of the trilogy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Extremly great game!! Well orginized and very fun!! This game is bery fun and is a great game for young ones as well as older ones as well

B0052REUW0|5.0|Pinker's connecting religion to human sacrifice is excellent but incomplete.<br /><br />Pinker suggests that the ancients speculated that sacrificing their fellow humans would be pleasurable for the gods: \\"wow life is really violent... this must be how the gods/angels/ancestors/etc like it... if they like homicide then we best be proactive about it and sacrifice others to save ourselves\\".<br /><br />Primitive religion is not based on philosophical speculation but rather on drug induced \\"possession\\".  Like someone on strong pain killers might say some crazy things.  Now we know to ignore crazy talk like that but back in the day they thought altered states ravings were divine inspiration.<br /><br />I'm happy with his concept of \\"third nature\\"...  Basically, first nature is the whole kill or be killed, call of the wild instinct.  He calls the second nature the civilizing process that most modern people go through... learning manners, hygiene, impulse control, and empathy.  Pinker says that modern humans have mastered second nature to the point that stringent codes of morality and etiquette are no longer needed... people can now listen to violent or lewd music, play violent video games, and use harsh language without losing their essential empathy.<br /><br />I can remember when people would smoke indoors... doing so now is unthinkable.  In the same way, people used to enjoy watching gladiators fighting, public executions, animals being tortured, etc... now none of that appeals to anyone except for the occasional quarterback.<br /><br />I love his treatment of the development of empathy coinciding with the developments of commerce and book publishing... brilliant.<br /><br />I love his analysis of Blue states versus Red states being based on previous history... blue states were founded by farming cultures from the mainstream European cultural traditions valuing big government, law and order, and strong impulse control.  Red states were founded by what the author calls anarchic Europeans (the Scottish and the Irish) who were pastoral and had a much different mind set.<br /><br />A farmer's land is hard to steal... just call the cops if you ever have a problem.  But when your wealth is all in goats and cattle, etc  and you live out in the sticks... if you don't know your way around a broad sword your livelihood will be gone in the blink of an eye.  Basically, the red states come from a wild wild west mindset... so the red states value the ideals of small government, self reliance, the right to bear arms, and are much more apt to favor the use of violence.  Pinker doesn't dwell on the red states slave based past but the rough and tumble mindset is a much better fit to the practice of slavery.  The blue states came from a tradition of higher lawfulness and empathy so it stands to reason that they wouldn't tolerate slavery as well.<br /><br />Of course nobody farms or herds anymore but these ideals live on to this day.  The author believes that the western states were largely populated by their respective eastern states of the same latitude.<br /><br />I love musing on that.<br /><br />I HATED how he dismissed the French Revolution as a fascist disaster!<br /><br />Overall, an invaluable introduction to Peace Studies.  I look forward to reading future scholarship in this vein.anarchic Europeans (the Scottish and the Irish) who were pastoral and had a much different mind set.<br /><br />A farmer's land is hard to steal... just call the cops if you ever have a problem.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game ever. also new york is looking hot but they forgot to add a place similar to times square
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have always said that Hugh Jackman needs to accept roles that showcase his talents.  X-Men, Reel Steel, Wolverine...sorry, these were all fun movies - but he was playing it safe and having fun doing them.  Les Miserables is a venture that shows Jackman taking on his talents as an actor and a singer - his real talents.  [by the way he can dance too...yes he can.]  Jackman will win the best actor honors, the ensemble was magnificent and should earn the film best picture honors, and don't forget Anne Hathaway as a sure bet Oscar in her supporting role. What can I say?  Buy the movie, see the movie, love the movie...

You never know what's gonna happen and no one is safe from the walkers. It's one of our favorite shows and we love spending time together watching it and talking to our friends about it! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Kind of hard to read until you get further in the book to understand the style<br />It was really good
B008745B32|3.0|Slow moving, not what I expected.  The story is a good one, but the way it's written  makes it an effort to read.  I will try to watch the series on Netflix when I'm done.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is one of my favorite app's.  Although you draw, that is not the object of the game. You need to explore and reason your way through the game.
B00007E7K0|5.0|Fit my Canon Rebel Xsi stock lens  (18-55mm) as a replacement when I lost the original.  Would buy it again if needed.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|do not download this if you have a kindle fire. it may be an extremely awsome app, but after you use the app a few times it will close you out. you can't open it at all.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|I have always loved the heroes of might and magic series, with number three being my favorite, but when I finished all the campaigns and scenarios, I was left wondering if my time with the games was up. So I purchased the heroes three and four complete editions, and was opened to a new world in heroes three. Not only were there more campaigns and scenarios, but new creatures, Heroes, artifacts that could be combined and even a new castle.<br />I have enjoyed every minute of the game, and I would say probably best choice in a game purchase I've made in years.<br />I rate something based on my satisfaction with the product, this being something I would not change, with the vast amount of game play, it is something that I don't think I will ever get tired of, it was far more enjoyable than I had originally thought it would be.<br />It is defiantly a must have for any heroes of might and magic fans, if they don’t have it already.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|The Fenix TK41 is an amazing light. Its housing is made of lightweight, yet strong aircraft grade aluminum. It uses a cutting-edge Cree XM-L LED which is extremely bright and very long life. Best of all, it runs on common AA batteries, making it unique in its class. In an extended power outage or wilderness setting where you can't operate your battery chargers, being able to use AA batteries can be a distinct advantage.<br /><br />I suggest using high quality rechargeable AA batteries such as Sanyo XX eneloops [[ASIN:B0058GZWXQ eneloop XX 2500mAh Typical / 2400 mAh Minimum, High Capacity, 4 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries]]. They avoid corrosion problems, have more power output, and are much better on the environment and your budget over the long haul. The TK41 performs at its peak capability with 8 eneloop batteries. I keep two extra sets of four eneloops in chargers so they are always ready to go should I need to replace those in the flashlight.<br /><br />Those purchasing the TK41 may want to make sure they are getting the latest model which sports 860 lumens of maximum brightness. This is the unit I purchased and am reviewing. However if the earlier 800 lumen version is more afforable to you or at close-out pricing, you still can't go wrong - 800 lumens makes it plenty powerful!<br /><br />In addition to throwing out infinitely more light than even my monster 5 D-cell Maglite, the TK41 has several tactical features, which both my wife and I appreciate. When walking the dog after dark in our semi-rural area, the second lowest setting is perfect and gives up to 27 hours of battery life at this brightness. However, if an animal or bad guy suddenly appeared out of the darkness, the turbo setting can be temporarily blinding.<br /><br />Also, the strobe setting is one of the best on the market. Rather than a simple fast strobe, it alternates between fast and slower strobe speeds automatically. This has been shown to be more disorienting to a bad guy than a single-speed strobe. Compared to other tactical lights in its price range, this a significant feature.<br /><br />Another great feature is the two-button controls. Many tactical lights require that you cycle through several settings on a single switch to get to the strobe setting. In an emergency, that wastes time and requires calm thinking, both of which might be a problem in a true emergency! Worst yet, many lights require a twisting motion to change settings, requiring two hands. The TK41 lets you hold the left \\"mode\\" switch down for a couple seconds and it automatically fires up the strobe mode, regardless of what setting you were on - even from a low beam setting or if the unit was turned off. You do not have to turn the right \\"power\\" switch on before activating the strobe. Holding the mode button down for 3 seconds activates the strobe, 5 seconds changes to SOS signal mode.<br /><br />While either the strobe or turbo settings are useful in any self-defense situation, they should not be depended on alone. They probably give you at best a few seconds of the animal or bad guy being blinded or disoriented. If they don't turn and run, this would be a great time to use something like a Kimber Pepper Blaster II pocket size, double barrel pepper spray gun [[ASIN:B004MG63X6 Kimber Pepperblaster 2 Grey]]if the situation warrants it. (That is a very affordable and effective non-lethal weapon available on Amazon. We have one in each vehicle and on each nightstand and my wife keeps one in her office desk - she works alone at night a lot - and takes one when she walks the dog at night.) A Kimber Pepper spray gun and the TK41 tactical light are a nice combination.<br /><br />The TK41 also has a \\"strike bezel\\" lip on each side of the tail cap of the light, providing a striking edge capable of breaking out a car window in an emergency, and doing serious damage to an attacker in a personal attack situation if you were forced into hand to hand combat.<br /><br />My wife likes this light so much that we just decided to order three more, also in the 860 lumens power, so we have one in each vehicle and in her desk at work,where she frequently walks across an outdoor museum campus after dark. Don't bother ordering the package that includes the weak batteries... plan on using high-power, longer-life eneloop AA batteries and get a smart charger like a Sanyo or LaCross [[ASIN:B000RSOV50 La Crosse Technology BC-700 Alpha Power Battery Charger]].<br /><br />With easy-to-find AA batteries, an alternating-speed tactical strobe, and the brightest bulb in its class, this light is a great investment.
0142410373|5.0|My son read this book and it kept his attention.  It was exciting enough, that he asked for more books from Roald Dahl.
0979019710|5.0|For my review, Ill just copy and paste the facebook message that I was inspired to send to Hal after reading the book. It pretty much sums it up.<br /><br />\\"Yo Hal!<br />I work for Vitamix and received your book as a gift from our National Sales Manager, and your close friend, Jon Berghoff. Despite the fact that I have a bookshelf full of them, I haven't read a book in I dont know how long. But yesterday, something inspired me to pick up The Miracle Morning and start reading. I read the 1st 100 plus pages in 1 day. I set up my snooze proof wake up for this morning, got up and did my Miracle Morning (reading 10 more pages of the book as my \\"R\\") and after my workout, I finished the book (about 3 minutes ago.) I just wanted to say thank you for such an incredible gift. I'm going to do the 30 Day life transformation challenge starting tomorrow and I'll probably send out \\"The Email That Will Change My Life\\" later today. I'll keep you up to date on my progress. Thats it. Just wanted to say thanks.\\"<br /><br />Stop reading reviews and just buy the book. You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />Roddy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good graphics, true to life  presentation. enjoyable. definitely recommend to young hire enthusiasts. good game for horse crazy little girls or boys
1449410243|3.0|I bought this because I'm a huge Oatmeal fan; I love his website as well as his last book \\"5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth.\\"  I was a little surprised to find that the whole book is really just comics and humor about cats (maybe, in hindsight, I should have read about it a little more before purchasing, but hence, this review--so you guys know what I didn't!)  I'm a dog person, I've never had cats, never plan to...however, I DID laugh out loud at some things, but overall it was a little cat-humor overkill for me.  I'm sure for a cat lover/aficionado/person/etc. this will definitely be up their alley (or make a great gift!)  The price was very reasonable so I don't have buyer's regret as it makes a nice coffee table book that people peruse & laugh at, even me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Outstanding plot...many twists and turns.  Very well written, Keeps the reader in suspense from the beginning.  A reminder of the movie &#34;War of the Roses&#34;!!!!!!!!
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|This app was recommended to me, and I am glad that I was was able to personalize it to track my stocks. Love the market news tab.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I like the mix of hidden objects and puzzle games. It has a good story line, but I think it is over priced at $2.99 They should lower the price by atleast one dollar. I have enjoyed playing the game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|NICE APP AND BY THE WAY ASK YOUR CAT IF HE WANTS TO COME OVER FOR TACOS TOMORROW NIGHT BUT IF HE DOESN'T THEN SHUN HIM FROM YOUR FAMILY
B000MPSX34|5.0|I have made Fly Away Home the Amazon Instant Movie edition part of my library because it captured my heart when it came out in 1996. My husband and I did a day trip for my birthday and ended up in Fargo, ND where a first showing was happening that weekend.He is an ultralight enthusiast and patterned his first construction project after the one used by Jeff DanieIs. I like the music very much and feel it fits every twist and turn. My sentiment definitely guides my perception, but I would suggest this movie to anyone who wants a free spirited change of pace.
B004Y042N8|4.0|Brought this for upcoming trip to visit family. Should be fun to play with kids, we'll see, just hope it's not to simple.
1432794426|5.0|OMG this is an awesome, loving book about our Michael! Makes you understand what he went through and how he kept going despite his personal emotional pain. His love for his children, his fans, and all children that was pure and honest! I AM VINDICATED!Everything I have said about our Michael and more is explained flawlessly! God bless you Dr. Karen! LOVE YOU MUCH, SISTER!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|downloaded Temple Run 2 today and about half of the coins keep disappearing when dying on a run ... kiddo says Temple Run 1 did not lose points when you died in that version .... is this a glitch that needs to be fixed?  will we have to re-install Temple Run 2 if they do fix this glitch?
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love how the game is made and its a great sequel to temple run.  but when I try to use a gem for a second chance, it crashes. if they fix this its 5 stars in my book
B000SGRONM|3.0|It's a good book to pick up for a few minutes here and there.  Not meant to read straight through.  All the vignettes are amusing, and picturing a grown man in an elf costume is hilarious by his description.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Really cute movie with a good message. My 9 year old & I really enjoyed it! It was a good length too. Didn't want it to be over!
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|Foolish plot, even for sci-fi fantasy. Acting was horrible. Good special effects is the only reason I gave 2 stars.
B009FZFONO|5.0|My brother introduced this to me and I instantly got hooked! I just couldn't wait for the new season 3 episodes so I just bought them on amazon!! good quality too!<br /><br />Marlon S.<br />Los Angeles, CA
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A good read and kind of scary as it deals with timely world problems. Glad its only fiction. Inspires long page turning sessions.
B005COO1X6|1.0|I usually love his books, this one was a total let down. It seemed like he was in a hurry to write this one. So much more could have been done with this in my opinion. I'll still go on to be a huge Stephen king fan, I just hope the rest aren't a waste of time and money like this one.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Gone Girl: Very slow and not much of a plot.  Unfortunately this is the first book I read by this author and now I am turned off.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I played this app on my friend's ipad, and I really liked it. So when it came out for kindle, I was very happy. I don't see any reason why not to get this app!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|TEMPLE RUN2 IS AWESOME!!!! IF YOU LIKE TEMPLE RUN, YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS GAME. I RANK IN THE TOP 3% IN TEMPLE RUN. I BOUGHT THIS GAME YESTERDAY AND I FIND IT FASTER, HARDER, MORE ADDICTIVE THAN TEMPLE RUN. THE GRAPHICS ARE PHENOMINAL!!!! I HAVE OVER 100 APPS. THIS GAME  IS NO#1.  GET THIS GAME, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED. IF YOU LOVE GREAT GRAPHICS, SUPER FAST RACING, AND EXCITEMENT, GET IT NOW!!!!!
B00005QCVT|5.0|This is definitely an amazing movie.  It's transformative, innovative, and beautiful.  Gorgeous aesthetics.  Absolutely must  see. One of my all-time favorites
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I could not put this book down until I finished it.  I'm waiting for the movie.  I hope Ms. Gowda will be writing more soon.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Absolutly love this game. Initial stages are easy so that one can get a hang of things. As you progress through the game, it gets challenging. A great way to pass time during transit and/or one of those boring office meetings :)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I advise this book to anyone who likes an adventure story that skill change how you feel about life in general
B006LSZECO|2.0|The story was okay. I was somewhat enjoying it until the end. I wouldn't read it again and I would not recommend it to anyone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|i absolutely loved this book  i coudnt put it down. i thought the slammed series was fantastic so i bought this one. now i cannot wait for more from you. beautiful
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is the best endless running game to date. Beautiful graphics and easy to play. Level ups based on objectives makes this a winner in all respectes. Get it and you wont regret it!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey's wit and sarcasm at its best...great plot line. It reflects a realistic picture of our times and nails the terrorist mind set
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Downey is the best choice to play Stark. Best line in entire movie...\\"I want one\\". If u don't get it, then watch it. Great fun. Great adventure. Great movie
B000GCFY0I|5.0|It held my interest the whole time. I kept on wanting to know what was gonna happen next. It was definitely a book you could read in one sitting from it holding your interest
B000OVLIQU|5.0|Loved it, couldn't put it down! Mr. Emerick provides insight into the recording techniques that made The Beatles music special. His matter of fact portrayal provided unique insight to the bands talent and interpersonal relationships.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i downloaded this in January on the advice of my husband. im still learning how to use it but it seems simple and useful.  my husband loves it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it I would recommend it to anyone it is the most awesome app I have ever played. tough they need to get the version more up to date. So hopefully there is an update soon
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's 2x as better as the other temple run and its addictive! Love it lob  it love itbhgggggvbbbbbb highway jabs
3832793836|5.0|Erwitt's  street photos are the most amazing shots I've ever seen.<br />His timing is exquisite and some shots almost seem too perfect to not be posed.<br />The photos in this book do not do justice to the quality of the actual photos,More quantity than quality.<br />I think it's well worth it for the price of this book.<br />This is a great overview of an extraordinary photographer.
B00632HWOG|5.0|works great. got my kindle for christmas and this app makes it extremely easy to check emails and stay in touch
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found so many great ideas, heps, recipies, and more.  The only problem is putting it away, as i lose track of time.  its addictive!  Good for organizing, or sharing plans, homework, meetings, the possibilities are endless.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I thought it was going to have it all figured out. I really liked the ending. A good must read
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|can't play it enough. thanks for making a great game and it's free too. keep it up guys. you make them , I'll play them.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is a fun game but could easily become addictive.  I've had it since christmas but havent mastered it yet.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|I loved the product! The monkey is super cute and well made. The stitching for the pacifier attachment is also very strong. However, my child didn't care for the paci. It's your regular newborn pacifier they give at the hospital, so try that on your child, and make sure she likes it, before you buy the product.<br />As it turned out, my daughter enjoyed her fist more than any paci, and now this monkey is just sitting in the toy bin.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I used this knife during a 20 day survival school with the full intention of abusing it and seeing what it could handle. I was not disappointed. This blade is solid and has enough weigh that i was able to chop through 2-3 inch branches no problem. The solid tang blade is very durable and i was extremely pleased with its performance. I just ordered another one to keep in my gear.
B006AX6ONI|3.0|this book was okay, I though it would be more informative, I like Mark Cuban as a business man,and team owner
B0098XY5VK|4.0|playedthe trial and loved it. bought the expansion and still loved it but was lil disappointed by the minimal amount of paid extras. basically there should have been at least a couple more boards ...<br />not sure if paid is worth it unless developers send us like 2-3 MORE areas.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|By leaving out significant songs, this CD has shortchanged the fans. I am sure an extended one will come out with 6-7 new tracks and most of the people that bought this will pony up and buy the new one as well, paying even more for the tracks they already have plus the ones they should have had on the first one.<br /><br />Perhaps that is why \\"Can you hear the people sing\\" was left out..We are all expected to be slaves to a dying recording industry???:)
B009CF3P7E|4.0|Many aspects of the Star Trek lore have been followed but i do not like the relationship of Spoke and Uhura.  it doesn't fit the character.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Everything went as I had hoped. My CD came quickly and in perfect condition just as it stated. I will be ordering every 2<br />weeks until I have complete set of his CDS
B004WR125O|5.0|I use this with an Onkyo TX-NR515.  The receiver immediately recognized the device and setup was easy and intuitive. Connnection speeds are great for music files, both DLN and Pandora.
B009186E3O|5.0|After sitting on the shelf (or maybe in a box under the stairs)for so long that many Stones fans, including this one, had completely forgotten it...the brilliant \\"Charlie is my Darling\\" has finally been given the treatment it deserves.<br />In a happy coincidence the Deluxe version is also the treatment we deserve. It is superb. Having all three versions of the film plus extras, on DVD and Blu-Ray, is a good move. The highlights amongst the extras are the interviews with four of the Stones with Jones and Watts in particular, being absolutely rivetting.<br />The soundtrack cd is great, but the \\"Live in England '65\\" cd is better, and is the best quality live material of the original line up. A great bonus is the same live album on vinyl.<br />The sound restoration on both the film and the album has given them clarity, depth and power, and visually now the film is amazingly clear and sharp. The documentary itself is a fascinating up close look at the early Stones as they ascend to greatness...and a look at how hysterical and violent their audience was in the mid sixties.  In the ensuing 47 years since \\"Charlie is my Darling\\" was filmed, it has arguably never been bettered by any music doco. If you're a Stones fan, or a fan of music in general, just buy it. There's nothing else left to say really.<br />Just buy it.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|It was so hard to put this down! Every event is so descriptive. It's a wonderfully written book! I recommend it to anyone who is even curious about reading it.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|I have wanted this movie from day it came out! Thank you for making it and this a very warm experience.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I love the book.  Katniss is definitely a very strong spirited and brave character. THIS IS BETTER THAN THE MOVIE!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|would love to use the app on my kindle fire but it doesn't load the news feed! you would think by now they'd have this fixed
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I cry as I write this. I will say this is a book that hurts. Beautifully written. Terribly sad but worth it.
B004NEY9EW|4.0|My kids and I enjoy all of the James Bond movies. Some are definitely better or worst than others. This is one of the best. We like Daniel Craig, he is one of the best bonds too, in our opinion.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best app ever and for kindel fire even better like pauly d ya buddy and if you don't have this app you should really get it
B000063UR1|4.0|one of my all time favorites. first saw this movie at an Ecology Seminar.<br />for the time, great special effects with a great story. all ways wanted to cry at the end.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I loved this book! I grew up with Saturday Night Live and loved revisiting some of my old friends. This was one of my book club selections and it was interesting to see how the club rated the book. Everyone loved the book except for people who had not watched either Saturday Night Live or Any of Tina Fey's work.
0061122416|4.0|Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist is pretty short: just 167 pages long. Some might be annoyed by the simplistic prose or the straightforward plot. But the message in this story is what's important. It gives a positive attitude as it expresses the true meaning of perseverance when following dreams. But the book is not perfect. Aside from the simplistic writing style, there are several moments in which the story slows down a bit. The typical \\"show, don't tell\\" rule is broken occasionally, though it's not too painful to experience. And a more elaborate back-story for some of the characters would have been nice additions.<br /><br />I'd say that The Alchemist is a very good book to read if you're in the need to cheer yourself up. It should be given credit for being a \\"feel-good\\" story. There are plenty of flaws, but in the end, the book is fine for what it is.<br /><br />Grade: 7.6 out of 10
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun to play and it it really addictive. I just cannot stop playing this game. I think that it is way better then the first one I played. Love this game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome story! I love how a difficult but real life experience can have a twisted ending that is just awesome!
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book.  It did not end up as I thought it would. I would have liked a better outcome, but alas, that is what makes it a good thriller.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i love this game! its so real to the actual game at chuck e cheese! all it needs is more prides during the game!
6305428352|5.0|The kids had never seen anything like it as today's movies are so different.  They amazed me and watched it!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I recommend this DVD st to anyone who is a Sons Of Anarchy fan.  It is just great!  Good story line and the characters always keep you on the edge of your seat!
0670026603|5.0|This book had a little bit of The Julia Roberts Movie- Dying Young plot going on, but it was a great read.
B008476HBM|5.0|I loved this book.  If would have read it in high school I would never have understood it or appreciated it as much as I did now.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I felt that Fifty Shades Darker was much more on the light side than expected. Although it reveals Christian`s past darker side and the reasons why, he transforms into a much lighter character than I even thought he could. I loved the evolving relationship and drastic turning points in this book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is pretty fun. I like how you can name and customize your horse I just don't like how everything I expensive.
B0015AARJI|5.0|needed a second controller and sony is the PS3 brand. i', really enjoying this.works great and would reccomend this to everyone with a ps3
B000066744|5.0|Well done and thought provoking.  Highly recommend it.<br />I'd never heard of it before a friend told me about it and can't imagine how I missed this!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Character development a little lacking. Is the &#34;girl&#34; borderline personality disorder? Something just doesn't ring tru and grab you as it should.
B00A25NLOU|5.0|I devoured this short book in one day, just could not let it go - it's clever, enlightened, full of twists and surprises. Quite simply a delight of a book.
B006X5L6VS|5.0|the guy who lives next door to me had it on his cell phone and it was awesome looking  so I went on line to get it on my cell  phone  I just love it to death I've always been a star watcher  as a child and  this  makes it so very easy to keep track  on whats going on in the sky  at night  I`m very happy  with my purchase  ITS  AWESOME  :)
B005Q1W10A|1.0|But part 2 has a dics missing<br />part of the show is missing<br />don't know what happend but when i opened it<br />1 of the shows is not there
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Loved it. It was a page turner. Can't wait for Day 3 to come out. If you like action , great story line, and an epic theme then look no further.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed Safe Haven. Nicholas Sparks has a likeable style of writing.I would recommend this book,it was also a quick read.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Her style of writing is magnificent. This story is absolutely beautiful. My only complaint might be presumed as that of a stereotypical Christian, but a true one nevertheless. The morals are corrupt. I believe it could have been just as good a novel without the language, the sex, and the comments about \\"God\\". I'm not actually saying this because I'm trying to preach, I'm saying this because it dumbs down the idea of the true love and good decisions. So to us Christians (and there are a lot of us), those things aren't as perfect as some people will see it. Really I'm just giving constructive criticism. I'm not meaning to be a nuisance, you can take it or leave it. :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Bought the book when it came out!!  Loved it!!!  Saw Josh Duhamel was starring in movie and read it again!!!!  Can not wait for movie!!  Can I express my happiness that he isn't a young &#34;silver&#34; in the movie??!!!
B008EKON56|4.0|The item worked as stated.  I bought the item because the headphone jack on my ipod nano 3rd gen. stopped working.  I thought I could use this as a headphone jack.  I was disappointed that the volume control did not work through the line out dock.  The item did not work like I wanted it to, but it never offered itself as a solution to my problem.  The item worked well as a line out dock in my car.  I could wire it from the Fil0 L11 to the aux line in on the car radio and play the ipod in the car.  For this purpose, the item works well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love this app. keeps me busy when I have to wait.  my little ones 3 &amp; 11 both enjoy it as well.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a fun read. While the premise may be a little far fetched, the characters were fun. Ignore the dumb cover & title.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found do many recipes and ideas I don't know where to begin. once I get on pintrest I get lost for hours....
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This series is awesome. I love it and cant wait for the next season to come out. Really looking forward to it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Loved this book and can't wait to read the next book , amazing story , she is my favorite author
0812993357|5.0|Coddington has some graceful lessons and adorable stories of the fashion world to offer us. Worth reading cover to cover.
B005HSL626|4.0|My girls love to play it on the tablet especially when we are stuck waiting somewhere for a long time.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is amazing. Truly amazing. It's like J.K. Rowling and Andrew Clements all rolled into one. This book teaches an important lesson about respecting differences. It also changes the way you think of a young boy in fifth grade with issues forever.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very very time consuming. I like this game. there are many different things to do within the levels without having to spend real money. you could spend real money if you wanted but there is no pressure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The author held my attention by entering all emotions that allowed my imagination to create a constant sense of urgency of needing to know what happens next.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|My daughter likes it a lot and her friends all play it so she wanted to try it out before she bought the game.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I downloaded this while nursing my three 1/2 year old granddaughter through an illness.  She loved each part of it.  We slowly added more and more of the app to our pictures.  It kept her quietly playing for hours.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS EXCELLENT! Omg! I can't stop listening to it! Every song has a different style that I find amazing! This is probably the best album that she's EVER had!<br /><br />YOU CAN LISTEN TO IT STRAIGHT THROUGH!<br /><br />1. Fresh Off the Runway: a nice little explicit song with a GREAT beat! If it didn't curse so much, it could be used in a fast paced runway show.<br /><br />2. Diamonds: If you are reading this review, this song probably brought you to the album.<br /><br />3. Numb feat. Eminem: One of my faves. Beat is addictive and Em is funny, like he used to be. I love this song!<br /><br />4. Pour It Up: Rihanna's second single from the album. Her shortest songs are always so great! IT BEATS SO HARD! Sounds like a JuicyJ song. This song is great in the car or a strip club! (I've never been to a strip club, but listen to it and you'll know why.)<br /><br />5. Loveeeeeee Song: My least fav song on the album. I just don't like Future. She could have made the song alone.<br /><br />6. Jump: stolen excerpts from Ginuwine's \\"Pony\\", but nice to hear parts of his song again! This song is a great club song!<br /><br />7. Right Now: Another great club song! Great beat!<br /><br />8. What Now: A nice pop ballad. Used to be my fav song.<br /><br />9. Stay: Another ballad. This song is okay. I listen to it. I like the words.<br /><br />10. Nobody's Business: Perfect song for Rihanna and Chris. Their lives are nobody's business. Just listen to their music and get over it. She did.<br /><br />11. Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary: MY FAV SONG(S) on the album! (For now! It keeps changing!) These songs are fantastic! Slow, and words to both are great! Rihanna shows how she feels in \\"Mother Mary\\".<br /><br />12. Get It Over With: I REALLY like this song. May end up becoming a fav. So soft and the words are great. Don't talk about things, just do it and \\"Get It Over With\\".<br /><br />13. No Love Allowed: One of my favs too! If you have been hurt by someone, you can feel this song. Great music also!<br /><br />14. Lost In Paradise: I don't really listen to this song. It's cool though.
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|Most of you won't like this, but, by now,  Downton Abbey is all style, no substance...period glitter stuffed with an illusion of significance, sound and fury signifying NOTHING.<br /><br />I LOVED the first season, but face it, its been sinking like a stone since.  Not much left but endless shaggy dog story, the bottle is drained, nothing much being said, one more pretty packed empty piece of television drama...Julian Fellowes apparently  has NOTHING to say about anything, not about  life...love, pain, death, the human condition, who and what we are...you know, it's the emperor's new clothes...there is no THERE there...<br /><br />I bet he can keep it up FOREVER...see, I suspect, secretly, he despises his own audience...why not, we keep coming back no matter what he says, or what his characters say...its extremely well done, except for the plotting...are any of you getting tired of the fact that EVERYONE IS CAUGHT BY EVERYONE...no matter the time of day or night, no matter if it only  happens once for a micro second, if one or two characters are doing something that a third character must NEVER see, that third character just happens to come by at precisely that moment...this happens again and again...its 19th century stage farce, about as honest and effective as 19th century medicine...my god, aren't you tired of it?<br /><br />Of course, most of you won't agree with this...that's to be expected...
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Depicts the hardships of England during WW2. Just when I thought I had guessed the plot the story twists and turn. A good read
B0028IDXDS|3.0|UPDATE##### I am changing my review to Neutral (3/5) because I now realize that my  (now) 6 month old does not like pacifiers. He may have never liked pacifiers and he may never will. My 3 year old will not ween off his pacifier but my youngest does not do them.  Your child may not like this product, and judging by the other reviews, it may not be the Plush Toy Pacifier, it just might be your kid.<br /><br />Let me just say that this is the worse pacifier ever. If I could use profanity to describe this frustrating little plush toy pacifier, this review would be nothing but four letter words mixed with a couple conjunctions  and verbs and tons of profane adjectives, but since we are all parents or know someone who is, I will keep it clean.<br /><br />This pacifier does not stay in the infants mouth, the plush toy is actually a hinderance to keeping it in an infants mouth, and because of this, this pacifier is useless. The actual rubber part is very anatomically close to an actual human nipple, so to the infant, no other pacifier will do. So now you are ...lets just say you are in a very difficult position because you are forced to hold the pacifier in place , so whats the use. Our infant son is 5 weeks old and extremely fussy during his \\"bewitching hour\\", a pacifier that stays in place would be so useful at this time, but instead, we are force to deal with a very unhappy child between 7 and 11pm. Maybe this is a great product when the infant is older, but by 3 months, a baby can manipulate is own pacifier, so again this product is useless.<br /><br />If you are a parent to be, please do not put this on your registry. If you are a friend or family of a new parent please do not give this as a gift. If you are the creator of this product , I hope karma comes back and makes you pay for what you have done to parents of newborns.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was really good.  I couldn't believe I got it for free.  I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who loves romance.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is fantastic. Wonderful acting by all, excellent writing. Cant wait to see more. I do not have cable, netflix, bring us season two
B00B2V66VS|4.0|If you haven't played the original Temple Run, the game is a &quot;rail gesture&quot; (my invented genre). This means the character runs forward on his own, and can do other actions via finger gestures (and tilting).<br /><br />The overall gameplay hasn't changed from the original, which is only a minor disappointment.  I wish the kept something similar to the archery component in Temple Run Brave, or a jump cancel (Subway Surfers).<br /><br />The most noticable change is the enviroment. The graphics are more beautiful and there are a wider variety of obstacles.  However, I consider this change more different than better. The original setting, while more simplistic, worked very well and felt more approriate given the title.<br /><br />Another major change is the shape of the path.  In the original, there the character moved in a straight line and made 90&deg; turns. This time around, there are bends and hills. While these new geographical features reduce the monotony of the gameplay/surroundings, it also forces the player to react almost instantaneously when obstacles/icons &quot;pop in&quot; after moving around said features.<br /><br />The biggest change in gameplay occurs during the mine cart sequenes. I loved the idea of this feature, but hated the execution.  First of all, these sequences rely mostly on tilting. This would not be bad if the tilt recognition was calibrated better. Perhaps it's my device, but I had my Kindle completely sideways and still fell off of the rail. To make matters worse, the sharp/constant bends require you to react almost instantaneously.<br /><br />Probably the most improved feature is the achievements and powers ups aspect of the game. Filling your meter and completing achievements actually help use/unlock items that are useful during the game. This is good for those of us that do not have an intrinsic value system.<br /><br />Overall, you're getting a game with a much different look, but with an almost identical gameplay. While some of the new elements force the gamer to react on a whim (or die/miss an icon), others make accomplishing achievments more rewarding.  I would recommend Temple Run 2 as a nice alternative to the original, but not as a replacement.
B007STXHTM|5.0|Decided to leave the camera in a weighted bag at the start of a night dive, thinking we would return to our starting position. A dive buddy had to surface prematurely and I was forced to leave my bag, including the camera, behind. That was Monday night.<br /><br />Found the camera on Friday morning and it was dry, and working just fine. Battery was still charged too! Water temp was 64 F / 18 C.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This was a suprisingly funny video about growing up with a live person like Teddy bear.  It was real in the sense that the bear is just a regular guy and true to life best friend as any one would have, except he's a teddy bear.  I laughed from beginning to end.  And loved the ending as well when what life is about and best friendships come together.  I loved it. Two thumbs up!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Other than The Soprano's and 24, this is the best.<br />I'd put it on a par with 24, but nothing touches the Sopranos.
B002ZG9774|4.0|This movie is about a girl and a dream...but not the same dream that Jesse Spano had. And the bartender guy was hot.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I don't know why I hadn't heard of this series before, but I just started watching it and the previous 2 seasons a couple of weeks ago.  Even my husband is hooked.  What is great about this particular series is the way the writers and producers have eloquently meshed the lives of all the characters.  I am all caught up now and can't wait until Sunday evening for the latest episode.  Makes me want to live there!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I could not get this app to run on my Kindle Fire HD. Installed Accuweather instead and have no problems.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|thought the movie and soundtrack were great. I now have to type out several more words to complete my entry. Thanks
B009X01ELC|3.0|The Marware case is very good for protection of the Kindle Fire. I use the easel feature often - either setting it up on my desk to listen to music on my Cloud Player, or placing it on a shelf near the treadmill so I can watch a video while working out. The elastic band keeps it closed as I carry it around. My only negative reaction is that the case is so sturdy, it is also very heavy. I find my wrist getting very tired or even aching after I use it to read for long periods.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There is too much time spent on sex than there is over the story line in this story by James.
B008HK3S04|5.0|Made well and looks cute. Kindle Fire slide in easily and is well protected. Timbuk2 always delivers, would buy again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|way better than the original its more creative and fun to play. I think this is the best temple run version to play
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I loved this book.  I never read this one as a child, but I wish that I had.  This book causes the imagination to run wild.  I can see Treasure Island in my mind's eye!  Well worth the read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book from start finish! I never once got bored or thought \\"okay get to the point.\\" I suggest this book to anyone who loves a good original love story!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this book. I think DeMille has written far more exciting books. It tended to be slow reading
B006GWO5NE|4.0|The cable looks like the same as the one that came with my Kindle Fire. It has a nice snug fit in the outlet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game woo much I love my real horse posted I'm only 10 so it is a good game I do hunter jumper and it feels just like I'm riding posted when I'm playing this
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book is even better than the first. It just makes me crave for the next book. I would recommend this book for teens.
B004WR125O|5.0|This LAN adapter is for a new Onkyo Receiver with smart capabilities. It works great.  The only complaint I have is that Onkyo sells it seperately and doesn't include it fixed to the reciever in the first place.
B006H5120E|4.0|I watch this movie several times and never got bored in watching it again. The 3D format was good to watch.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a great movie. It pulls at heart strings. Great teaching tool for families- conflict, love and consequences.<br />IT'S A CLASSIC!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Thank you Colleen for the most amazing story.  Your writing makes you feel every emotion!!!  Please keep them coming.  I can't wait till the next book from you.
B0096BIENY|5.0|It arrived on time & in good condition. I had only heard them a couple times but hearing them from my speakers was a Wow! moment. I loved listening to them!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was a great book better then the movie. Read it in 3 days while i went to school. Exited to read the other 2
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a addicting but AWSOME _ EPIC. Game whoooo ya ya yaw ya ya whoooooooo ya ya ya WHOOOOO YA
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It arrived on time & I enjoyed listening to it very much. Great quality. I could listen to it many times.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I grabbed this since I enjoyed the first one. This second version does NOT live up the the first on my kindle fire HD. The controls lag tremendously with your side to side movement. It constantly has trouble distinguishing your hand gestures taking turns versus sliding and  jumping which is really annoying. So far both times I received a above million score, it freezes when you die and closes the program losing your score but more importantly the coins and gems.<br />They have also switched into a more profit friendly system of lives, making it tough to collect gems needed for lives instead of being able to buy them with coins<br />Overall concept is cool, almost better than original but with all the issues and bugs I have to give it one star. If it didn't lag and mess up every other game I would give it 4
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great set of blu-ray discs! My boyfriend loves Rocky and this was a birthday present for him. But, now, I want to watch it more than he does!!! Great movies-also includes Rocky Balboa, which a lot of other 'sets' did not
B009YP9L7U|5.0|An amazing stroy we all know to well they gave up on love but needed each other, for life! You can feel ups and downs that this all too odd relationship has to offer. Amazing I just couldn't put it down!
145470246X|5.0|I love this book.  It has so many beautiful patterns in it.  I am so excited and can't wait to get started on them.  She also shows the patterns is 2 differently color combinations and bead shape options to get your imagination and creativity going.  A must buy!
B0083V2VW8|5.0|If you're a Who fan you can't not like it.  The Sting cameos are fun as well.  &#34;5:15&#34; is probably my favorite part of the movie.  I think about that scene every now and then in the real world.
0385535147|5.0|love me some Grisham! And this book did NOT disappoint!!! Some very unexpected twists and turns that makes this book a must-read AGAIN!! (kinda sorry I sent it to my sister in Utah to read...)
B0086700CM|4.0|Love beating my friends scores and keep them trying to beat it. But Temple Run 2 is even better then this one!
B0096HIEE2|5.0|this movie tells a great love story and has really good dance moves. its very entertaining and fun to watch. Makes you feel like you're there.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I knew the basics of the story of the search for this enigmatic musician, and today I finally watched the film.  Oh my goodness!  This documentary succeeds on every level - as a detective story, a music archive, an anti-apartheid journal, a pop culture history, and a demonstration of the hidden wonders of the human heart.  It truly is a miraculous journey - the fact that the complete story is so unbelievable makes it that much more overwhelmingly powerful.  CANCEL WHATEVER YOU WERE GOING TO DO AFTER READING THIS REVIEW, AND SEE IT RIGHT NOW!!
0316228532|5.0|I ordered this for my mom who is a big fan of Harry Potter books. She really likes it so far. I get to read it next. I think it looks great just by reading the covers. I think you all would enjoy this! No problems what sieved in ordering it. Came in just a few days. lOVE AMAZON,,,,,
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A must read. Could not put it down. I don't sit down and read many books but I finished this in three days.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are so much better!!! So much more excitement! With mine carts and zip lines, you'll love Temple Run 2!! It's got more coins, and gems! Did I mention the monkeys are 10x their normal size? Only a true explorer could have the guts to get TR2!!!
B008I34ZFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this film it was a little campy, but it told the story very well. I think everyone should watch it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|What was all the fuss about! It is not even that well written!  The main character constantly biting her lip gets really old fast. I am surprised that it has become the sensation that it has become. A lot better books out there.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|i loved it. i like the dark knight movies.<br />also the price was so nice.  i couldn't afford buying the movies separately.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|So far I have had a good experience with this game. It is an excellent follow up to Temple Run. One thing I have had trouble with is, sometimes when im playing it it glitches and starts to freeze up. Other than that, I think its great. I also would like to share, that it would be cool to have themed temples.!(:
B006VREHRS|4.0|I watched many lately on computer, but this one keeped getting stuck it made me very angry. I hope it was my computer.
B000H5V8DG|5.0|[[ASIN:B000H5V8DG Alias - The Complete Collection (Seasons 1-5 + Rambaldi artifact box)]]  Action Packed but also has a softer side at moments. From crazy disguises to jetting off to Paris, Rome, London, Mexico, and all kinds of secret locations.<br /><br />  Sidney Bristow (Jennifer Garner-Affleck) is amazing playing this part. Sidney is an international spy recruited out of college and trained for espionage and self-defense. Sidney faces many trials and tribulations.  I am hooked.  So everyone needs to get this box set or watch on prime instant video.<br /><br />  It is an amazing show that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Hope you enjoy the show as much as I did. Girls kick Butt!!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This such a good book, It is so hard to know that this kind of stuff is still happening to children, This book was very close to home for me
B005SDMDRW|3.0|I only received a very short version of this book hence the 3 star review.  I enjoyed what I received.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|First of all, I am just going to say . . . Wow. I have read Mockingjay about fifty times and I have never gotten tired of it. Suzanne Collins, you are an inspiration.  The trilogy is so amazing. I call Mockingjay the heart throb and meaning of the trilogy. It literally sleeps next to my bedside table. Katniss is not the girl she used to be. She is now more powerful than ever. But inside . . . She is a mess . This book shows how difficult war is. People think that war is just a bunch of people fighting, killing  , bloodshed. But there is an emotional ordeal to it. Some  lowly critics  say that katniss should be stronger. But what I am saying to them is that they should try going through that much  at that age. same with Peers. He is my favourite character I admire is courage and sacrifice for katniss. It made me cry when he was Tortured  . But I knew he was going to return to katniss because no one can ever make him forget that he loves her. I have so much more to say about the book. But for now I  am going to get out that people who rated this book one star . . . Your reviews show that you have not studied the book like I have. With that said . . . I recommend the trilogy to everyone above the age of twelve. Just remember that if you read this  amazing book, it will never truly leave you. Every night I lie awake or asleep thinking about the hunger games. I have  vowed to myself that I will never forget the hunger games. We should take into account that this  could happen in our future. Where the only way to make humanity cower in fear is by giving up our children. This book is a lesson of the past, of the Roman gladiators and their tactics in a very real arena where there  is only one Victor. But most of all, the hunger games trilogy is a warning for our future; that maybe, after all this killing,  decent species will actually take over what is left of our remains.  Suzanne Collins, thank you for writing the hunger games.
B00122V0IG|4.0|Beethoven : Symphonies Nos 1 - 9 is a 1991 Warner Classics collection with Beethoven's nine symphonies conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt. Harnoncourt leads the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. Each booklet contains short music notes but other then that it is quite sparse. A collection that I can recommend for both the novice and the expert listener. Recommended. 4/5.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Downloaded this after seeing the reviews.  Absolutely loved it -- and so will you.  Really hoping Andy publishes more science fiction for kindle.
