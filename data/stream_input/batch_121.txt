B00CWUGYTC|5|This fits perfectly. I was a bit skeptical at first but then I got used to it.
B00A7L740Q|5|We bought this for my niece because she loves Justin Bieber and she wears it all the time.  I was very happy with the product and with the Ann Arbor T-shirt Company.
B00GFUYRGM|5|Cute,fun,everybody compliments on it when I have to take it out to use a key tag! Love it!
B004S886P6|5|I get so many complements when I wear this scarf!  So pretty and colorful!  I'm very happy with it.  It goes with many colors and is the perfect length.
B00D77YCPW|5|Beautiful
B00K65DFXS|4|very pleased
B00DUB2WNE|5|ok
B00HY90BGS|5|They're perfect for work and they're comfortable.
B000P55RDA|5|no tags great fit and feel - and not white!  not my first pack and doubt will be my last.
B00UKYD4O0|1|I could not even wear it as a shirt it was so small!!
B00MG097HE|1|Waaaaay too large
B00K04PU8I|1|Unfortunately the &#34;sleeve&#34; on the bottom of the left arm was sewn on backwards; fortunately I have a sister that sews and we were able to turn it around. The hat was pretty floppy, but afterall it is a halloween costume and one does not expect much for such an inexpensive item. It held up for the evening.
B00H4RJTBS|4|It was perfect
B00EOQHU8G|4|it fits me really nice at first it looked as if it was too small for me but when i tried it on was a perfect fit.<br />the only thing was that there is a little part of the bottom that seem to have missed the machine hence 4 stars and not 5.
B00DKN4JEW|5|These tend to run a little small, even with their sizing guide.  I had to return my first one.  I highly recommend you order one size larger than whatever you calculate from their size calculator.
B00AEW6ACQ|5|Very cute and stylish, must have!!!
B00PVLQ2TQ|5|Perfect for normal waistline. Good product with two sections and card holder. Arrived promptly and intact. Had to return my husband's due to small for his waist. Will recommend to friends.
B00APTYJHQ|3|These ran small, and the cost to return them to China wasn't worth it.  Guess I will find a smaller girl to give these to.
B005791WCE|5|The cutest thing ever.... My so was so adorable
B000MPND2A|4|I like the tops which don't make rings on my lets.  The extra padding makes for comfortable wear.  They do seem to stretch the more you wear them so will order smaller size next time.
B00JKFPQJQ|5|so, my son is 8.5 and is on the tall side. He usually wears a 8/10 in most clothes, but even the size 8 in this jacket was slightly too long in the arm for him. However, its manageable with the adjustable arms in the wrist, so he can wear it now and for sure at least for another year.
B00GGB0X7W|5|Cuter in person. Love it and washes up great. True-to-size.
B006IYIQKS|5|absolutely no problems.  It was delivered quickly and the quality was actually even better then I expected.
B00M0HZVZU|5|warm @  good looking
B00DYR9EGC|5|The product was perfect !
B005MJDXCG|5|These are some high tech socks - cushion in the parts you want, arch support and florescent energizing color (it's a thing). Quite the pricetag but if you want to romance your feet once in a while, these are the ones.
B006E5MBQQ|5|comfort and quality
B001UFCO62|4|The leotard is exactly as pictured. My daughter loves to wear it around the house and the color is perfect for our needs.
B0029F1K7G|5|Great for Fl babies and summer time so light, no blankets allowed in cribs with babies and Fl getts pretty warm. This was a great present so we bought more. Shipped very fast. No problems at all.
B00S41W8NY|5|Ordered size 34B. Beautiful and so extremely comfortable, I would love to wear it everyday, not only for my Zumba classes.
B00C1WZ9PG|5|My 18 year old daughter loves her new Team Daryl jersey.  Now my wife wants to join the team too!
B008D94PZG|1|Tiny wallet. Not impressed with it. It made my &#34;wallet mess&#34; worse, also Feels extremely cheap.
B004FQY1RI|4|I like the color, though it is more muted than the picture. More of a scrub ceil blue.<br /><br />I'm 5'8 and 145 lbs, this scrub top is baggy on me. Not quite get in the way of work baggy, but very borderline. I wish it would shrink.<br /><br />Not stretchy material.<br />But,<br />Good price.<br /><br />Not sure on the sturdy since I have to exchange.
B00F4DRHUY|5|This was a gift for a 95 year old woman.  She loves it.  Relatively soft - not scratchy at all - but soft enough.
B00FZVUO3M|4|I had thought this would be more red, but is a salmon color. Nonetheless, it's a great fit. Maybe a tiny bit bigger to size, but I haven't washed it yet so it will probably go to size.
B00B7B09RK|4|Beware:  this runs a little small.  Other than that, it is cute and works great underneath mesh or low-cut tops.
B00IEWTIWC|5|This suit fit as expected and was good quality. My daughter loved it.
B00L53FVJQ|5|Fits as expected. I love it! Very good quality.
B0096NH8QQ|5|Good fit
B000804GGQ|5|AMAZING SOCKS!!  I've got painful gout, not diabetes, but I can attest to the comfort of these guys after having a couple of pairs for a month.      When it's laundry day I take special care NOT to lose these guys in with my other socks, I hate losing these guys and I hate mis-matching them.
B00M0FPKVM|5|I LOVED it... I was wondering about how it was going to fit me ( mostly because I have a big butt )and turns out it fit me... the top fits just right, the bottom it is a little tie (because of my butt) besides that LOOKS SUPER CUTE.
B00GIEBNSU|4|These bras fit well and are similar to Lane Bryant bras. I wish they had more colors in my size. :)
B0007IQFJK|5|I bought my first money clip three years ago, and it has performed wonderfully for me.  The magnets inside the clip are very powerful and will not let your money slip.   I was showing my clip to a colleague at work, and he wanted one.  I went back to Amazon, and the price is still very inexpensive.  I ended up purchasing five (5) more for friends and small gifts.   The metal money clips are junk and do not work nearly as well.   I would recommend anyone purchasing the magnetic money clip and leather card holder.
B00CMCD664|2|It is said that 95% Cotton / 5% Spandex but I feel that there is no cotton at all or 5%.  My skin doesn't breath in it.
B00KHCPSR6|5|Nice heavy shirt! Thanks!
B005CSOHRC|4|Just received them today. Have not washed them yet. So I can not comment on fit. They do look a little long, but after washing may shrink to size.
B00JPSELR6|5|Good fit, warm and ummm had no problems the the drop seat feature.
B0094422V8|5|I bought 2 pairs to hold my bedsheets on my bed!  Works great and affordable.  Look on how to do this online, best solution for bedsheets.
B005LX6WF8|3|A fine vest, but the cut isn't right for me.  The &#34;42&#34; fit my chest, but the waist was too big.  Looked too much like a smock.
B0012YGDYK|5|This container is elegant looking. It is very practical. It even feels good in the hand, smooth and a very fine leather.
B00MHA7H4I|4|made cheaply, but the panties are so cute
B00BZDT8X6|2|Here is what I felt about this jacket:<br />Warm Level: warmer to 35 F<br />Size: as expected, fit<br />Style: fit, very stylish, I like the design of wrist, the back, and the collar, very nice!<br />However, I ended up returning this product...because the zipper is too small. I had hard time to zip it up or spent a lot of time to zip! Also, I expected this jacket warmer, at least when the weather is 30 F, I can still feel warm. However, it is not. So, I returned this product. Otherwise, I really love this style.
B00DZ0OSRI|5|Well made suit. Top stays in place and coverage is good.  Legs aren't too high cut.
B00PXANMQ6|5|I love these pants.  They fit perfectly and are great for golf.  I will be buying more of these!!
B002R0FEPC|5|We really love this tight! My 12 years old daughter always worn out her tights so quickly, it seems there is always a way for her toes to drill holes into them, even though I tried virtually from all dance stores nearby. With this tight, never a problem and it was comfy. She actually wears it with normal dresses to go to parties. We highly recommand this product.
B009OLJM0A|5|OMG it was perfect for our &#34;two of a kind&#34; party we had to go too.  Funny how everyone remembers camp crystal lake ha! Its a cute t-shirt and it fits great.
B001D4HJSS|1|the threading was horrible. they were frayed and the ranked looked like it was melting. almost like the chevrons were bleeding into each other
B00J66HQ6A|4|It's a beautiful dress, good quality but fits a little bit small.
B0046BPFKY|5|excelent quality the robe is very soft and comfortable  be sure if you order xxl you are a giant of a man  cause xxl means super big shaquile oneil big
B00K7U3PUU|5|Super cute little set. We live in Florida so the jacket works well for our daughter. I felt the quality was pretty decent especially for an entire outfit that will only last a season.
B00DVV5DFW|5|Very comfortable and soft material.  Not too long of a rise so they don't sag in the seat/crotch.  Stay loose, and legs are long enough to stay down and prevent chafing.  If they hold up they may be the underwear of choice for me in the future.
B00FBQNNOS|5|My girlfriend liked this shirt that I bought for her as a gift. She finds that it fits fine, but it is a bit tight around the bust.
B000H1Y1WK|5|Get a lot for your money. My husband was a pirate for my son's birthday party, we paid for a pirate to come to his party and I think this costume was better then his.
B00JMN51CS|4|Nice shirt to wear anytime.
B00TF9BYEI|5|I read all the reviews so i knew to size up! I am 5'8 185 and curvy.. I wear size 12 & large in tops.. This dress fit perfect! I ordered size 1X , i think i might order one size bigger for a looser fit.. The dress hit above the knee for me :) I got the coral/Ivory it is a little sheer.
B00KSGRVLM|5|Love the retro look and it fits nice!!! Was perfect on the 4th of July!
B009VGOLV8|2|Head was hard to fit and hard to see out of. Ears flopped and face looked a little creepy. Outfit was way too short, definitely no bigger than woman's medium.
B00008JPTI|5|Wish there were more shirts like this to buy with the tab collar
B00B3PHFPE|2|When I place the order it was for a 2X since I were a large and wanted to b safe due to the previous reviews I read about it running small but what I received was a too small to put my head in shirt I'm absolutely not happy with this especially after the hype I had
B00466T5VO|5|Love this tie. It's a classic that never goes out of style. Great for any occasion where a tie is called for, weddings, funerals, your wife's law school reunion party (which you've been dying to go to since the invitation arrived in the mail,woohooo!),  dressing up for Halloween. Fortunately I don't have to wear one to work anymore but if I did this would be one of my go-to ties. Width is just right, not too fat or too thin.
B00KQ4ONGM|2|I purchased a 1x, and it was so tight I could barely get it off.  My sister wears a large and it fit her perfectly.
B00UW4DPX8|5|Love it!
B0007YR9QM|1|The band size ran a tad small and the top part of the cups were big so there was puckering etc. Very strange fit. Hopefully a friend of mine will fit better in it.
B00EOYVVDS|5|Gave as a gift and it fit her Perfect! Thank you!
B0098ZJ4C8|4|Fits our daughter great, will be one of her favorites this summer.  Quality is good and the price is fair.
B001PMPMZ0|2|The thigh highs are adorable, but they fit really tightly around the thighs.  I have really slim legs but the elastic is so tight it looks like it's meant to go around a child's thigh.  I understand they're like that to hold themselves up, but it looks very unflattering.  I recommend this if you weigh less than 90 lbs, or want your thighs to have a muffin top.
B006QZC5B0|5|UPDATE: I've now worn the hat myself a couple more times in the wind and it isn't as \\"floppy\\" as I alluded to on my daughter's review of it as she wore it first. The hat itself is very lightweight and it has the same \\"stickiness\\" to the sweatband as the \\"shaped Coolbar hat I purchased at the same time, so it does sit fairly firmly.<br /><br />Yes, the wind does bend the brim in higher winds (we sail from Hood River, Oregon, famous for it's windsurfing winds and is a bit of a distraction). But, considering the hat is designed to pack flat, is very lightweight and very comfortable, I raised my rating to 5 stars realizing this is more of a hiking sun protective hat, rather than a sailing hat, especially in 15-25 MPH winds.<br /><br />THE ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />My daughter wore it first when we took our sailboat out and said the brim was too \\"floppy\\"; blowing down in front of her eyes (the brim is quite flexible) or against the side of her face. I've since worn it and for fit and staying on your head without the strap it works well in light winds. In heavier breezes the included chin strap is a must as the brim is quite wide (great sun protection) so the wind has a large surface area to work on and as stated above is not stiff enough to withstand the pressure. The crown has no stiffening in it so it just collapses when you take it off, so great for travel to sunny climes. I really like the hat, but won't use it for sailing, but great for lounging after with that cool drink.
B00461SN44|2|This item was not purchased. This item went out of stock After I had paid for it. I was informed that the item was no longer available and that a refund would be posted to my credit card.
B001U2V6CI|5|Super cute!!  However I did order two sizes larger than my usual size.  In clothes and most leotards I wear a size Small but for Capezio I wear a size Medium usually, but for this I heard it ran even smaller, particularly shorter in the torso area making it hard to pull up and tie.  So I ordered a Large to be safe.  I'd prefer it a little tighter around the body but any smaller and I wouldn't be able to pull it up to tie and I have a pretty average sized torso.  So I'd suggest if you have a shorter torso go ahead and order one size larger than your usual size, but if you have an average to long torso order two sizes up.
B00AJ1APAU|5|These fit perfectly, and were a great color to go with my Ninja Turtles Halloween costume.  The material is nice and thick, didn't pill up, and was a decent quality material.  Great buy.
B0029IKRHW|5|Worked great for our Children's Production!
B000OP9TZ8|5|these have a nice band that is a little shiny. the cotton is silky feeling. better than the fruit of the loom
B000KAJQTQ|5|In the cloth diapering world, nighttime diapering is a popular topic.  It can be confusing and even slightly overwhelming to figure out what works for your family.  There are so many choices out there, and keeping your child clean and dry is, of course, very important!  We experimented a little bit, mostly with pocket diapers, before we settled on the combination we use now.  We use Stacinator Stretch Wool covers with prefolds or fitted diapers.  We have been extremely happy with these covers!  They are very soft, not itchy at all, and we have never had a leak overnight.  One cover is enough for all night long if your baby sleeps through the night, though if our daughter wakes up and happens to be wet we do go ahead and change her and rotate covers (we own 2).  Because this cover is made with 100% natural fibers, that promotes airflow and prevents rashes.  I would recommend this product to any cloth diapering parent who is looking for a cover that is simple, reliable, and comfortable.
B00FHJUFY0|2|I love this brand and the shirt as expected; however, the white Nash simply a panel on the front of the shirt and not designed well
B00NAK1PLU|4|I knew when I bought this product that the leggings were a free size but I purchased anyway. The leggings do fit me, but just a tad bit snug around the wai.st area. Also, the leggings are sort of see through depending upon how far you stretch them, but as long as you wear with a longish shirt of tunic then all should be fine.
B00DNVIXES|4|Im 5 8&#34;<br />I knew this drew would be short but my butts pretty much out. The dress is soo adorable though. It looks exactly like the picture and is nice material.  Other then being short. I like it alot
B00ESPHF56|2|They picture them as high socks but they're no taller than regular crew socks
B003V4AKZM|4|It feels like real leather; it wears like real leather; it looks like real leather....its a real leather.But I just want to say:it's made in china.
B00CHI3NZW|5|[[VIDEOID:moNJXVO0B0VEJ]]I just got this item in white, light pink, and grey and all of these are just exactly what I expected from the picture that I saw on online. I love the colors since they are neutral (yet pretty colors!) which perfectly match most of stuffs that I have. The size wise, I would say it is slightly bigger than I normally expect. I picked medium just to be safe (don¡¯t like anything too tight). However, it turned out to be<br />much larger...I still love them because they are so comfortable and casual. The qualities of the shirts are very nice as well. If you are size small to medium, definitely get small!
B00EBXUYYO|5|Love it.  Thanks
B007WEN0ZY|4|If you are looking for a light weight pretty hat, this works. If you are looking for serious sun protection, go for the Walleroo Diva instead. The Diva has lining in the brim that really projects you eyes and skin from the sun.
B00E1SSQ7Q|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B008OC8PGW|4|These are a good value for an everyday office slack.  Not going to look or feel like a $150 pair of wool slacks, however, you are paying way less and you don't have to send these to the dry cleaner for all that extra expense.  They fit true to size and launder well.  I would recommend.
B003ICCQ2W|5|These shorts are ideal for the gym or wearing around the house. They are extremely comfortable and feature an elastic waist band and drawstring for a snug fit. The good quality and affordable low price is another benefit. You can purchase (2) pairs in different colors, for less than the price of a single pair of most athletic shorts.  These shorts have no pockets. I sleep in gym type shorts and find the pocket less type more comfortable to sleep in. I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />The service provided by Amazon was excellent. The product was delivered to right to my door by US Mail. I didn't have to rummage through the rack at a sporting goods store, to find my size \\"out of stock\\". Not to mention the hassle of parking etc.
B00DJM9B6A|5|I dont know why this has less than 5 or 4 stars. I bought this at the Theory store a year ago and came online today to look for it in another color to add to my collection. It's a great suit. It is chic, professional, and well-fitted. I've worn this on successful interviews and work events. I have it in navy and it has become a work staple in my industry in finance. Keep in mind Theory runs more like European or maybe even Asian sizes, narrower fit, than American sizes. It is just how it runs. The same is true for some other brands, of course. You just have to be familiar with your size in different brands. I'm a 2 in a Theory dress, 0 for jacket size, and, for example, Banana Republic doesn't fit me. Ie, Boss and Zara's have narrower cuts as well.
B0081FKLL4|5|great case every vita owner should have one of these! this case is best compared to the speck Iphone case, very strong, nice and protective!
B00HU08KLE|5|I really didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprized.  I like the fit, I needed white pants for work and they look good!!
B00JL42N9W|3|Extremely short but kind of covers but, very cute but not so expensive that I would try to return.
B0079VJL7G|4|Fits perfectly, and very comfy! I bought two of them and will definitely be buying more. They offer good support and aren't itchy at all. Very pleased with this product!
B00HD94OIA|5|I absolutely adore this dress on my daughter.  It's roomy due to the style, but very cute.  Can be worn as a summer dress or over layers in the fall and can be dressed up or down.  Quality.
B00DUGBBOA|5|Love it right out of the box.  Discovered this item by Slidebelt after looking for the mission belt that was on Shark TV.  Slidebelt is the original company, whereas mission best is the imitator.  looking at the images for both - the better design in the buckle is clearly SLIDEBELT!!  got 2 of these belts in different colors.  very comfortable.  I'm looking forward to years of use from them.  my wife liked it so much she wanted her own - but they don't list womens belts yet.  I'm anxiously waiting them to come out with a burgandy/cordovan colored leather to complete my collection!  nice to have 1 belt that fits jeans, khakis, suits, etc. without having to use different holes in belts or adding more holes to a belt!
B00F10SERA|5|Very comfortable
B00R58QZHW|5|Nice hat. Fits my big head nice and snug.
B00MBN4596|3|They're cute but too big
B00QPRKRRS|4|Very comfortable
B00CBAOBFC|5|I wear this around my house to keep warm in winter nice fit.
B00A2J5MMU|5|I got a large and the fit is perfect. Warm, wind proof and the lining feels nice. Happy with my purchase.
B00LES048A|3|Not very good quality product cause they still had much dust of fabric after i wash them and it sticks to my baby skin when he wears them.I am worry it not good for his breath.
B00HUNY2V8|2|I don't understand why I was asked to changed my rating on this item. I rated this item 3 stars before because I though it was fair for the quality of the item and because it doesn't fit as it is displayed on the picture. I am irritated for having to rate this again as if my rating was not fair before.
B00C3XMHNA|3|I haven't bought any  yet because it's not shown on a model and doesn't state the inseam length, nor do any of the 36 reviews. I'm 6'6&#34; and need long shorts.Will someone please comment.
B00SMQJRW6|4|Pleasantly surprised with this pair of pants.  For 20 dollars this is more than a steal even though I'm not a huge fan of cargo pockets this pants still rocks.  Only hoping that the quality holds up but for the price I wont complain.
B004WSD6V6|5|Couldnt find in stores, love the adjustable waist band and flat front pants, would definently recommend them. Items were delivered quickly .
B005HR8BX4|3|Still somewhat scratchy after several washes. Material somewhat chintz. Great lines. Looks nice. Fabric is not so wonderful.  I give it an Eh.
B001LRG082|4|Perfect. Going to order brown or now if I can find same ones in brown
B002HK3NWI|4|It is good that is a pack of three pairs. If you manage to put them on without tearing, they look beautiful and very comfortable. The color is on the light side, so it is very natural looking. Would have given five stars for looks, and two for tearing. Do your nails before trying them. Also, I am tall 6 feet, and they fit great.
B00D63ZEH2|3|The picture on Amazon shows a dress with a belt. The dress arrived with no belt, so I'm sending it back.
B00G4BLVJS|4|Very nice. Very soft.
B00937TOWQ|5|I got this piece of garment for the wifey. She loves it!  It performs the way it says it does.  Islip these on and it's over.  My wife can't keep her hands off me.  Doesn't crush the manhood but moves with it It is an excellent piece!I plan on getting more and chucking out my old stuff.
B002RBYHOK|5|Cute and inexpensive tutu for my fairy Halloween costume. Fit perfect I'm 115lbs and 5'6&#34;. Elastic can stretch a lot more for larger sizes. SHORT. I turned it around backwards which was slightly longer on that side and it JUST covered my butt. I wore boy shorts and stockings underneath and it looked good.
B00LT7EH70|5|I love these jeans. The fit is great and flattering. I typically order long because regulars are usually too short and while longs are sometimes a little too long, wearing shoes that have a bit of heel works great.  These jeans are much longer than I expected and I will have to hem them before I can wear them even with moderate heels.  I would rather have them too long than too short though so all in all, it was a great buy.
B00RVBIR6U|2|I found the bottoms to be a little smaller then what was described and the top to be much larger. I have pretty large breast and this top dwarfed them. Wish you could mix match sizes for tops and bottoms.
B00NN0BMXI|5|Perfect! I got this for my best friend as a birthday gift, I tried it on just to make sure It would fit (considering we're the same age and we pretty much have the same head size) and It's not too small, not to big. Super pleased. It didn't take too long to send either.
B00M83TGGQ|5|For hallowing for my little girl (10)
B0009GD62O|3|I hate the fact that it has no pockets but everything else is good. I do not regret buying it but I would not buy it again. if you do not think that the pockets are essentials then this is what you are looking for with a nice price
B00K4T1HJK|5|These are amazing! They go well with my figure plus the material is easy to breath in during a hot day!
B004ARMG1U|5|I have always gone to the department store to buy Gold Toe socks.  However, since I don't do so much shopping at the mall, I thought I would try Amazon to see if they had them..  Luckily, they did!
B004BIWO4W|5|Thank you, this t shirt made a great gift for a Godzilla fanatic, just like I wanted it too. And it arrived just in time for xmas.
B00IDZ8JIY|2|I have purchased several (6-7) Uptown Girl head coverings in the past and have usually been happy with them. I bought 3 of these paisley scarves in different colors this time. The fabric, colors and fit are OK, but the &#34;tails&#34; are very, very short and can barely be tied. I wouldn't recommend this head wear unless you like extremely short tails. Very disappointed; I gave them away. :-(
B000OE624A|3|I bought this tie in a rush when I realized I didn't have the appropriate neckwear for a wedding.  Although the quality is quite good for the price, the width (3 7/8&#34;) is of the &#34;dad&#34; variety.  Sure, skinny ties will go out of style eventually but this tie is very wide from the knot to the tip.  Do not buy if you are slim and/or young.
B00GLE2HYG|4|Just as pictured
B00RXHJWAM|5|I've been looking for something like this forever!!!  I finally did and I love them!!!
B00LA72JMO|5|Looks great
B005UVVTUY|5|wore them yesterday.
B009O8M04S|5|Hits the hard-to-achieve balance in maternity clothes between being comfortable, classy and also being form-fitting enough to still qualify as sexy. Well done.
B00LCZDPO0|5|Love it
B003ZW8D2W|3|Good fit & comfortable for exercises.
B00866FLZE|5|Great shirt, colors are as it's pictured. Runs a little small though for a large, so if you wear a certain size I would get a size bigger. Thank you
B0030FP8R2|5|Got a ton of compliments and it worked perfectly with my belt. I'd just YouTube how to put on a belt buckle it was pretty easy. Great for country western dancing.
B008917RGW|3|Material not as stretch-y as expected.  I incorrectly assumed it would be similar to yoga pants, just in shorts format.
B00M2JIXH4|5|This is an awesome jacket. Definitely a head turner. My son looks really handsome in it.
B00J2PIX6C|5|Fits perfect
B00JIH6L3G|5|perfect fit and fabric
B007Y8J40S|5|Great pants!  Love them!
B003DCYQ3O|3|The product pictured online makes it seem as if the coin skirt will cover your waist/hip area fully. It more wraps around like a sarong, leaving either your backside or side exposed, depending on where you tie the ends together. The coins have held up, nothing has fallen apart, I just wish it was exactly as pictured.
B00GGPZHBU|5|The sweatshirt came in a timely fashion and it fits wonderfully. It is soft and exceedingly warm to wear. I love to wear it.
B00LHZN9ZA|5|I love this coat! Perfect fit (doesn't feel too puffy), well constructed, and love the high collar. Warmer than I expected, but it has come in very handy during some super cold days so far! Highly recommend.
B00RNT993A|4|True to size
B00RZDTDKS|4|Hopefully color does not fade during wash.  Nice durable material, however seems to wrinkle easily.
B00KOHUMHK|4|Beautiful colors, perfect fit. Only one negative . . . the straps are very thin resulting in the dress having the appearance of a nightgown. If the straps were wider a bra could be worn without the straps showing. Would be especially helpful for women who are large on top and need the support.
B00PODHK6A|5|For me personally these are the best fitting pair of jeans I have ever had, so comfortable as well. At this price they could not be beaten.
B00K756R3M|5|Love it
B004QQMCNM|4|The good:<br />-PRETTY! I have been wearing the same nursing bras for months. Drab, white parkas with itchy seams. This bar is PINK! And lacy! I don't wear things that are pink and/or lacy, but I am so tired of ugly white nursing bras I'll make an exception. It's nice to feel pretty again, instead of just useful. haha<br />-This bra is also very soft, in the fabric and the seams.<br />-The design is very nice.<br />-No underwire! The &#34;prettier&#34; nursing bras always seem to add underwire. WTH? I'm still nursing you nitwits!<br /><br />The bad:<br />-This bra is just a little big on me, both around the ribs and in the cups. Pre-baby I'm normally a 34F. Post-baby I've been at 34I, now 34H. So maybe ordering down a size next time would be ideal. I'll let you know.<br />-Lift is... meh. Not great. I find myself &#34;adjusting&#34; a lot, but this could be due to the poor fit.<br /><br />Did I mention it was pretty?
B004VO7UJA|4|These socks are comfortable and fit well.<br />However, they are rather on the thin side, so I'm not sure how well they will wear or last.
B0031U0P42|4|Seems to be good quality.
B006HRSOSA|5|Bought these for my husband for his Halloween costume and he will be using it during the Winter! Hubby is a big guy and it fit perfectly. I purchased the 4x and he was able to slip right in. He's 5'11 350 lbs and it fit perfectly.
B005TM5P1S|3|This is thin cotton (I believe) with a nice fall, good for warm weather and great with sandals. However, it has a long train that I had to have hemmed (I'm 5'4). I think it was worthwhile- but don't expect the dress to last more than a season with regular wear.
B0059EQBW8|5|Great looking jeans.
B000783RG4|3|The white tshirt has a pink tinge to it. Good quality otherwise. Putting this shirt alongside other white tshirts, the pinkish shade is obvious.
B00JRWLMGS|5|It's perfect!
B005G2916G|2|I wanted to be able to write a good review here, but I just can't. My expectations were very high, yet sadly I was disappointed in the lack of functionality these boxer briefs provide.  first and foremost, they don't have a peehole! It's made with a separate compartment for your junk, and it's very comfortable, but no peehole means that you have to untuck your clothes each time you need to go. The reason this becomes a problem is that when you pair this with a fitted undershirt that comes down to your knees, all in an attempt to not look bulky under your clothes and not let your dress shirt untuck itself, not having that easy access becomes an impractical nuisance.  I already spend a lot of time making sure everything is tight and tucked when I'm dressing to leave the house, and I don't need to do this 3-4 times throughout the work day in my business attire.  Secondly, these boxer briefs ride up A Lot! I'm talking about straight out of the box, not long term use after many washes, but fresh new undies. Pull it down nice and tight, but the moment you sit down they pull halfway up your thighs. Needless to say, this starts pulling up your undershirt and wonderfully enough starts untucking your dress shirt. As you can tell I don't enjoy constantly having to retuck my clothes throughout the day, but this is what's happening when I wear these boxer briefs.  Bottom line is that these are comfortable undies with very little practicality. When I wear them solo around the house they're wonderful, but not when I need to dress up nicely.
B00JHZTPUK|5|perfect
B0031U0P42|5|got this form my hubby for Christmas, what I didn't know about it, he quickly discovered, you can unsnap things to pull off the buckle that came with it and replace it with the big old fashioned belt buckles (that hook into the holes from the front)
B002VF3M0C|1|The item in the picture is not what I received. The item that came was a one piece piece of @#$#!!!!
B00DW2YHO8|5|I got an Extra Large because I like my clothes to have a little more room, and this one definetly has more thank enough room to spare! Stick to your true size, even if you want it a little on the bigger side. I should have gotten a Large, but I know that it's a little iffy when it comes to Asian sizing, though Allegra K has said that their sizes are more adjusted for the USA purchasers. Also, WASH THIS GARMENT BEFORE YOU WEAR IT! I meant to, but grabbed it in haste and through it on for work and when I got home and took it off, my armpits were pitch black! Easily washed off, but please, do yourself a favor and WASH it alone first to let the color bleed out a little. Other than that, LOVE IT!
B00LU28018|1|Too big from the bottom it does not fit well :( i have to send it back!
B0087CNBMM|5|This dress is so adorable.  It goes with a number of Tea leggings (or your own).  I just love the color and fun look of it- it's subdued but still so colorful and unique.  One of my top favorite outfits for my daughter.  A must have!
B003WIZ566|4|I bought these for my husband, not because he has circulation issues, but because he hates how regular socks leave an imprint from the elastic!  These are thinner than his normal socks, but the fit well, stay up and wash well.  They turn into little tiny tubes after being washed, but they are still easy to get on and stay up.  I'd buy him more.
B00PV0K2CA|4|Person loved their gift
B0091DXXL0|5|There is a drought on jean shorts for boys in 8 Husky.  Like these were it.  I did search after search at the time and could not find any.  On the on-line Gap I think they were out of that size in Husky or didn't even make them in Husky and on Old Navy the Huskies started at size 12.<br /><br />These are a bit big in waist and slightly snug across behind but he never complains and they look really good on.  We are so happy to just have one pair at least.  Denim shorts are my 7 year old sons favorite types of shorts (I think because he loves jeans so much, don't know why he doesn't prefer comfy cotton shorts or basketball type athletic shorts) so he always says &#34;yay&#34; when he gets to wear these.  They fit well and he will most likely be able to fit them next summer thanks to the adjustable waist and they haven't faded much after a good handful of washes (using the &#34;free/gentle dye free, frangrance free&#34; type of detergent.<br /><br />Not that they are cutest jean shorts in the world, very simple style, but they are great for the price and that we just need at least one pair of denim shorts for summer.
B00861TI5I|5|This bra is very comfortable the cups seem to run a little big
B00O1PEHE0|5|Cute!
B005EP6WDA|5|My son loves metal mulisha and was really happy when I bought these shirts. And they were a great price
B00080M1OU|5|Excellent wallet.  Good quality and I like the no clip aspect.
B008F1KWLS|1|These shirts run very small. The 2XL was smaller than the XL. I wasted $32 on postage and have no shirts.
B00SA7IHH8|4|Love the design. .! Shrunk a little the first time i washed it! :( but love it
B00PFOLZ8W|5|I was supposed to receive this around April 7-23 and I had ordered it in early Marc . It came much sooner than I expecte . Maybe by about 2 weeks earlier than anticipated? So, definitely fast delivery! And I love my case! It's so pretty and I just absolutely love it on my tablet. I'm happy with my purchase.
B006WI4O60|5|I liked the look of the shirt but initially thought $30 was a bit high for a plain cotton LS.  It is worth the money. The material is soft and the fit was perfect. It is a quality shirt.  I liked it so much that I bought another one in a different color.
B00CH3BAZ2|4|I love this dress. I'm about 5'8&#34; 140-145 and kinda busty, and the small actually fit well. This surprised me, but they didn't have the turquoise in stock in medium, so I gave it a shot. The straps aren't quite right to wear a regular bra, so I found that I had to wear strapless. That's the only reason for the missing star. The pattern is really nice, and the fabric feels pleasant.
B000E82WVI|5|These might possibly be the most comfortable shorts ever made.  I am a big guy 6'3\\", 225# and am in good shape but I would would never consider wearing lycra to yoga class or the gym.  I haven't gotten into yoga (yet!) but I can see where the fit, cut, flexibility, and \\"weight\\" of these shorts would be perfect.  I find the XL to fit perfect for me and the legs are long enough that they don't \\"ride up\\" all the time so that you have to keep pulling the legs back down.  I use them for workouts both alone and under lightweight workout shorts in lieu of compression shorts and they are incredibly comfortable for just lounging around the house.  I thought that they might be hot but they seem to breathe very well, they are stretchy enough to \\"move with you\\" not hampering flexibility, and although the cotton is absorbent it dries pretty quickly.  The material is thick enough and the cut is loose enough so that even when worn alone you aren't walking around with your \\"goods\\" on display but yet they are supportive enough for weight training and aerobic equipment in the gym and I'm sure even for the yoga they were designed for!<br /><br />I have one pair that I've used for over a year that show very little sign of wear and I just bought another pair of shorts and also a pair of the pants for when things get colder.  Great product, great design, quality materials, great value.  Buy 'em!
B00GUNBAYG|1|Piece of crap. Don't waist you time.
B0083LT07M|4|Many compliments so far on the bracelet.  Looks good and feels fine while wearing.  Good to have some Jesus on you at all times.
B00Y1AU640|1|baby clothes
B00579V5R6|5|Very nice quality, sized properly and very warm.
B004ZCW8AE|5|I ordered the Stride Rite Comfort Seam socks for my granddaughter who is ultra sensitive when it comes to her sock seams....my daughter has put purchased several different brands hoping to find one that doesn't irritate her...not until receiving these socks has my granddaughter been happy with the seam across her toes...the socks have virtually no seam and I will be purchasing more of these socks in the future.
B00SXAWQ6U|5|Nice print. Comfortable material. My husband LOVES them. Will definitely order more in different patterns.
B001G8UXH0|5|These are the cutest slippers ever!  I bought them for my daughter and she has worn them nonstop.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for classic bunny slippers.  They are ideal!!
B00AA5A79O|4|I live in Florida its hot and humid these kilts are lite well made and keep you cool.the only problem is getting the right size and because they fit more than one waist they don't fit like a custom made one but still good for the price
B00KB2X3LK|5|I got this for a friend and the shirt fits wonderful! He wears it all the time. Good material, good size, and all around a really nice shirt!
B008MA13EC|4|These pants are super long, which is great for a tall person. I'm 5&#34; 9&#34; and 165 lbs. The pants are fine with my shoes on. I'll order large/long next time. Good quality material; not too thick or thin. Very pleased.
B00ID4RGDO|5|my only caveat is that the heel reinforced section falls above my shoe, even though my size is in the upper end of the sizes stated. I don't think anyone really notices, but if this is for a formal affair or something, I'd wear different socks.<br />On the bright side, they're excellent for my diabetic ankles, they don't constrict, and they are comfortable at the end of the day. I recommend them
B008RD7T60|5|I love this dress! There is not one thing that I don't like about it. I can't wait to order more.
B00A7FQKJS|5|Leather like, soft touch, nice compartments. very pleased with it!!!
B00ELNHIDO|5|This was the perfect gift for my son's 25th birthday...he loves it, memories of him being 3 years old and running around the house as a Power Ranger.  I love it!!  Fits as expected, not too &#34;cartooney&#34; .
B008L583U0|5|I love this top as I do the pants that go with it. They are so much more comfortable than the plain cotton version.
B0041EA8O4|4|I don't love the single butt flap, but with the right maneuvering you can make it all work. Great fabric and weave as well none of that itchy waffle weave you get on a lot of polyester long johns.
B00E3DI5A2|5|Cute shirt, but would have been even better if it had graphics of the elements.
B002B2XCJQ|5|Great throwback Zach Morris costume, comfy shirt, my husband even still wears it outside of the costume since he likes it!
B008ZYQ3A4|5|Wow! This uniform was very well made! It looks exactly like the picture!! There was a couple of strings that I had to cut though, but other than that it was fantastic!
B0020MKZ7O|3|A nice dress but if you are an adult like me that peruses through the young adult section for more competitive prices and trendier styles buy a size up.
B007IVC9JE|5|I received the wallet a day before its projected date, so very quickly.  The wallet is beyond cute, I love it.  The only drawback is that is smaller than my wallets I've had before - there is no compartment for checks and if you try to jam it into one of the pockets, the wallet won't close.<br />Otherwise, love it.
B005VM2TQK|5|This is my husbands favorite pair. He loves how they look and feel. Unfortunately he left it in a hotel room. Was not able to get it back. He came back to Amazon to order another pair just to find out it is no longer in stock. What a shame. Hope to find it in stock again soon.
B0083V25UG|5|I bought this wallet for my husband for Christmas.  it exceeded my expectations.  this is a very good purchase for the money.
B008LKFIC6|4|It was a good fit, however it was not the correct color for my uniform standards.  my employer wanted a darker gray color.  the seller was very helpful and let me keep the item.  Great seller!!
B009RA63J6|4|And it actually is what I consider tunic length--so many are too short by my standards.  I like a tunic that is almost a short dress--covers rear end and thighs pretty much.  This does that fairly well.  I wish they had it in a turtleneck version.
B00EFYW2VC|2|It is a beautiful bra, but again, Panache is way off in sizing.  I went up another cup size from the last time I tried this brand and it was too small and I still feel like I am squeezing myself into a tourniquet.  As compared to other brands, this brand I have gone up 2 cup sizes in and still not found a comfortable fit.  P.S.  I am using the convertor to get my actual size since each brand varies, still no luck with Panache.
B007ZKAGR0|2|not the best Obama mask out there, but the price makes it nice and doable.<br />mask is of thick plastic.
B00DGBXKK2|4|Great colors and good fit for an 8 yr old boy. The quality is nice, too
B00PMUN9X8|4|Bought it for my boyfriend . Looks good on him and he seems pleased with the pants.
B00KKFYH7C|4|Very nice
B00EW80KWO|5|The shirt I ordered was exactly how it was describe love the shirt and sent promptly
B00L01365E|3|This shirt looks nice, the color's great, but it's super small and made of very cheap, nearly see-through material. For the price, I'm not exactly thrilled.
B003ZPKDRM|5|Using to hold name tag for work. Did not like how some holders tore up my clothes. This works great.
B00CLZHSH0|5|Great shirt for a guy who had never been to a gym XL is an M at most.
B001H0F3CW|4|Fits well. Comfortable damp or dry. Light weight. Priced lower than some competitors. I look forward to buying more in assorted colors if available. I would give a 5 star rating if it had a pocket!
B00OH270AA|2|We bought a small. The coat looks nice online but wheb it arrived, this hood is just weird and oversized when placed over the head. The fur and hood protrudes out far beyond the face and head of the wearer, which in turn reminds me of the Snorks cartoon. I am sure it will be too difficult to return so we are stuck with it and the funny hoody.
B002020D08|5|I was worried this would be a flimsy material, but it's quite sturdy.  Comes out of the wash in great shape!
B00116D90U|3|There was no sizing listed so I went by the Amazon standard sizing. When I received it the product tag states the small is for an A cup. Otherwise it's a good concept and looks comfortable, if I could get it on.
B00UVTD2JG|3|They make my but look flat and I have a bubble butt so that's not easy! Lol they're good lounging jeans
B001335F9Y|4|This product is amazing! If your shoes get dirty just pull it out and wipe them down....its that easy! It gives them a nice matte finish and keeps the leather from getting that dry cracked look. I would recommend this product to anyone one who has even one pair of leather shoes!
B00KHWM914|5|Awesome, length is perfect!
B000L7J18Y|5|She loved them and fit perfectly. I bought size 5-9 and her foot size is an 11. She didn't think it would fit but it did perfectly.
B00O521ZXU|3|low rise
B00FDMURU8|5|Love it and it's super cute. Wish shipping was a but quicker but worth the wait!
B00CB4D67C|5|Fits great, seems durable enough.
B00EC0EKUU|3|so,what they don't tell you is that this is actually a two piece, but that's no big deal because if you put them together easily and it look okay. Now, my problem is my bust is too big for this, i'm a 34 C and got a Medium, thinking it'd work. NOPE. i need more of a large, the zipper (yes, it has a zipper) won't even go up to my belly button. (the zipper is on the side, i use belly button because it's easier for you to understand i'd hope).
B00JS8ROX6|5|Great fit and very soft!
B00I5GPHLS|5|Maybe I just think these are dressy compared to a pair of boxers and an old T shirt. 😊 In any case, they are super cute on and fit very well. I am a size 4-6 and got the small. I'm not going to put them in the dryer because I wouldn't want them any smaller.  The fabric is a medium weight, very comfy.
B00IIZANUQ|5|I'm a girl, so Idk how it'll fit on men, but if you're around my size then it should work! :) They're EXTREEEEMELY comfortable too!
B000MWXBGG|5|Perfect on all accounts
B00GN73QOG|5|very good
B000YIIGHW|5|I bought this for my son after out dog ate through the zipper of the last one. He says the straps are comfortable and there is more than enough room for his books. Another great backpack from Columbia!
B001PR221W|4|Sometimes the straps detach while you're wearing it, but when you remove the straps it is a strapless bra that fits well!
B008D5EWT4|5|these are my favorite sock, I have very sensitive feet and they are very comfy
B00R8J10QE|5|Absolutely loved this item!! Just as expected and very happy!
B0094FYTA4|5|Quality material and fits exactly as described. Comfy and casual. One of my new favorite shirts. Very pleased customer! I would purchase anything else by this brand based off of the quality of this one item.
B004NNC7L0|4|Only complaint is that the material is a bit rough to the touch.
B00DEO5AI6|5|This was a hit! My daughter looked ridiculously cute in this funny reindeer get-up. I am passing along to a friend for next year and can't wait to see her daughter in the outfit :)
B00VDGCPWQ|4|The print is really cute! I could have gotten a small though. But I still love it!
B0067I4BA4|5|I was very pleased when I received the robe.  I was looking for something comparable to the robe i had, and this robe is perfect.  Same weight (a couple pounds I'm guessing), nice quality, just a really nice, soft robe.  I have yet to wash it, but I really don't think it will shed or anything.  Not that type of robe.  Just velvety and well made.  Yay! :)
B00F3WDAIE|5|I love this top but it does fit tighter than the other medium knit tops I have from Patty Boutik. It is stretchy and comfortable. If you want a looser fit, I would get a size up in this top. This style is very flattering.
B000SKI76G|5|Great price for a great product. Would recommend to anyone. I'm size 13 and these worked out great. I use them for working out mostly.
B00H7XY590|5|This dress fits like a glove and is so flattering. It is short enough to show off my legs, but not too short where I could accidentally flash someone. For sizing, I am 5-3, &#60;125lbs, muscular narrow build, and got the size S. It's the perfect alternative to a little black dress. It hate all black dresses, because black is for funerals. This dress is cute because the there is a black crochet/lace like material over a white built in slip on the bottom, and white over black on the top. Black and white as well as the crochet/lace makes it very fashionable.
B0009PFJX4|5|My teenage daughter absolutely loves this dress and wants more colors. She wore it to two homecoming dances and was the star. It fit like a dream and is so flattering to her shape. We may be ordering the red for the winter ball.
B00LVGVIIA|3|required seamstress to fix
B00ESXF3GQ|2|Fit perfect in size 12 in waist/hips, but calf area was too small.
B0042RNFR2|5|Used it during my Alaskan cruise then again for my winter European trip.  Is lightweight and warm, highly recommended.
B001KM1GR8|5|Love the product.  great quality of work.  runs true to size.  will by more of this same product again. love it.
B00CU8ILGA|3|Great product, loved the color and material, but much too large. Had to return it. I wish they would have let me exchange the medium I ordered for a small, or XS, but I was required to return it directly to BackCountry instead and pay for return shipping, and told that if I wanted a small, I had to order it separately. The return process was easy though. It's too bad the medium was more like an XL. I'm six feet tall and it was swimming on me. I ended up buying some PJs elsewhere.
B002AFFJ8Q|2|This was really cute and i liked it but it broke right off the bat. The thing just fell apart.
B004498F82|5|My husband spends a lot of time outdoors. When we were looking for clothing to keep hime warm, the prices for thermals and base layers really surprised me. We were either spending a LOT per piece, or buying subpar items. So when I ordered this, I tried not to get my hopes up too much. I mean, $18? Sure to be mid grade at best, right?<br />I am so thrilled to be wrong. These work great to keep him warm, and the quality was excellent. They've held up to several washings with great durability and no shrinkage. Not only would I buy again, but I *did* buy again!
B009T2D6A6|5|This is a great fitting panty. Love the seamless construction, feel of the fabric and comfortable fit.
B00Q59WK6W|4|Dress was everything we expected.  My daughter is 00.  The 0 fit a little big but expected that.  Was well made and looked beautiful.
B00B6E9YOW|5|These shirts wear very well. Great fit. Little to no shrinkage.
B00YFVZMPS|4|Runs a little small, imo, and a bit cheaply made, but I was expecting that for the price.
B008YU8VHC|5|I have really liked this sweater since it arrived.  It goes with everything!  I am thinking about buying it again in another color.  It is very comfortable and washes well.
B00E1CR76S|5|Perfect Fit
B00E3DWM8I|5|I love these, cute and covers my flaws. (tummy)
B008WJ8H10|3|It's cute, it just looks a little cheaper made in person.
B00YGSECLA|5|I love these bras.  I got maternity bras at Boscovs thathe ended up sagging down (the back part rode up) as the day went on.  These are very supportive, the elastic around the chest keeps the bra in place and is super soft.  I would recommend these to anyone nursing.
B0042IX45O|5|same as the middle finger review, it was sent as a gift so I don't know how he likes them yet
B00401Z02I|4|This tie looks simply AMAZING.  People notice it in a heartbeat.  It may be a little thin, but for my uses, it is perfect.  The design is exactly like the pictures.  Good job, a very useful tie.  I took a star off because it was just a little too thin.
B00MFHUAI8|5|I would recommend them to friends and family.
B00JSJMZCU|2|The dress itself fit. But not the belt... Kind of disappointed about that.
B003DTLUA4|5|great price , fast 2 day service, love the London Fog quality. Sooo easy to shop Amazon.
B007JX0FCO|5|awesome belt...
B00J2S40MK|5|This blouse is very cute.  Unfortunately it was way too small in the sleeves and defective.  Seller was willing to give 35% back but I would not accept 35 percent.  I notified Amazon and they were awesome in taking care of the matter and refunding my money.
B00TM8P038|5|Excelent
B00AVXUF4M|5|Wife loves Mr Bean
B0048LKIRM|1|Bought these a size up and they are small and tight in the waist.  I could tell from looking at them when I opened the package that they were a size smaller than they should have been in the waist.  Tight in the legs too.
B003Z653JE|5|I love this kigurumi!<br />It's super cozy and definitely gets you tons of attention LOL<br />Stitch is my favorite Disney character, so I'm a bit biased... ha<br /><br />It arrived in excellent condition, and the packaging was absolutely adorable~
B006R1GZ78|5|This little sarong is easy to wash, doesn't wrinkle and looks great!! I used it in Hawaii and could go anywhere in my swimsuit and sarong.
B00EECKPQ4|5|Love these pants. I would have bought more, but they only had one color in my size. Get more colors, Amazon!
B007488OD6|5|I bought a pair of these last year from a local store and loved them. Of course when I went back they were no longer selling them so I decided to buy them from Amazon. I am fairly petite and I like that they do not drag the ground or look excessively baggy. I weigh 115 and bought several colors in xs. The fit perfectly and actually wear better the more times they are washed. The colors also hold up surprisingly well after probably 40+ washes.
B00BOT88Z0|5|This case is perfect for my eyeglasses, which I only wear during driving. I wanted something rigid and strong because previous cases often ended up on the floor of my car and were easily stepped on. This case is lightweight (which is great if I have to carry it in my purse) and fits my glasses and a cleaning cloth. The inside is lined with soft, felt-like material so my lenses do not scratch when I store my glasses. I'm happy with my purchase.
B002OSEMV4|5|Gorgeous bow-tie. Just what I expected.
B00CQ8JIKW|1|You get what you pay for....was like a thin guaze sprayed with some horrible chemical. I threw it out right away.
B00B281LTS|5|These are the first no show socks I have ever bought in my entire life that do not slip off my heel and end up in a wadded mess in the bottom of my shoe.  They stay exactly where tey should.  They rub a bit, so if you have sinsitive skin keep that in mind.  But all in all they are pretty awesome.
B006STXNWY|4|The quality is awesome, I could go 1 to 2 sizes down
B00QJJDJJ0|4|I was JUST wearing them! Lol. It's a little too small, but that's my fault for not ordering a size up...... LOVE THEM THOUGH!!
B008H2ETBE|4|I bought these socks because of the price and quality. I think these socks are like socks should be. I have had them for a couple months now and can not complain.
B00FSB61A4|5|Perfect fit.
B00MFFB79G|4|They are bigger than I expected, but so cute!
B00FPU73EQ|5|Great little socks!  Got to note that some flats are cut so that you can see the bottom of the toes...just don't think there's a sock out there that can be a no-show in that circumstance.  There has to be SOME considerable toe coverage in order to be able to keep them on your feet.<br />But for me, I bought them for my walking shoes so I can be a tourist without looking like one! :)  And for that purpose, they do just fine.
B00O3P73VW|5|Perfect fit!
B00T8K8XIO|5|Love it!  Fits perfect, cute summer throw on and super sexy!!!  Just ordered 2 more!  I'm 5'4 and 135 lbs and medium fits great.
B000JE7UCS|5|it fits good, is exactly as described, I do wish it had the old school snaps, but for this price I have no complaints and I know I will get lots of use out of it.
B0046MFRDI|4|I love these pajamas.  I don't think I got a sleep mask with mine, but I wasn't going to use it anyway and I could've missed it.  These are every bit as comfortable as I expected.  The legs are a little long and I occasionally step on the bottoms - My pants size is about 33&#34; waist & 30&#34; length and I got a medium - but I don't really care since these are pajamas.  I'm not quite sure how these will hold up... I've seen a few loose threads and I have had them for a little over a month now.  Like the title says, they are good considering the $40 price tag.
B00E7875VI|4|Pretty, but runs very small. If you are not a size small, you may not fit into it. My daughter usually wears mediums in everything and it barely fits her. If you are of a certain bra size, you will probably not fit into it.
B00BMD9XL6|5|Perfect!
B000N8Q4X6|5|I ordered these overalls for my 11-year-old son.  We had searched every local store in our area, and were unable to find one that sold overalls.  Ordered these and was very pleased!  They are comfortable (he never wants to wear anything else!) and sturdy.  I will probably be ordering a second pair!
B00IHMSVVI|3|Item did not fit.  After e-mailing back and forth re: the sizing, they refunded my $16.99
B000MTD970|5|Love my new Ray Bans!
B005XHYM4U|5|These pajamas are so adorable in person - the pink color is a bonus for the female lover's of Spongebob.  Fit is great and my daughter could not be happier!
B00AQB3Q1I|2|Print was super cute<br />Good construction<br />Bust support not great I need more support ( I have toddlers)<br />Suit way to big in the torso area
B000SKI752|5|Great deal!
B00BIE053O|4|Great sexy outfit, but doesn't fit my giant bust. I believe after a C-D cup this would be too small in that area.
B000MOMTKI|5|Cute detail...my daughter wore this as a flower girl dress and it was adorable! Had to send back original size because it was too big
B00AH22ZYK|5|Fast shipping. This hat is nicely made and its warm! I can't wait to get some use out of it this winter. I don't normally pay so much for a hat, but I'm thinking it was worth it with how warm it seems to be. Guess I'll know once the snow flies!
B00R7CIHMC|1|Way small!!!
B00M31CB4C|5|It is beautiful, looks like the picture
B00NGEFWJQ|5|My 9 yr old daughter loves it and great price.  She purchased her first dress herself.
B000YVKJMO|4|Item was shipped on time and looks as promised, just know that they run tiny.  I usually wear a large in American Apparel women's clothing, and these look much more like a small.  Oh, and they're super short.
B00KC375EE|3|It looks nice but I received the wrong color.
B00LA9DW5A|2|Love the shirt and love the band, but the shirt did not have &#34;I, The Witchfinder&#34; on the back like the picture showed, so I am somewhat disappoint.
B007JX7KPO|5|Very, very soft. Great color and easy to wash. No ironing....(love that part) I feel very comfortable wearing this and I'm very glad I purchased it. Very good quality too.
B00S6F3W92|5|Great job!
B00IK27Z2Q|4|I agree you need to order a half size larger.  Very comfortable
B00AG42E0O|5|LOVE IT. This is the best fitting skirt I've ever purchased online. I am slender, 5'7&#34; 105lbs, and I was concerned that the skirt wouldn't stay on my waist or that it wouldn't cover my bum. But the fit is absolutely stunning. And it washes great, no weird stuff!
B00BLYN9CU|5|This is my 6th pair of papi boxers(different styles,materials) once again I am very pleased!! Material is awesome & feels very sexy, I am very well endowed & supports me very well g.f loved seeing the bulge before they came off :)
B0040J7ZDM|3|Over priced!  But if money is of no concern go for it! Very nice material so soft! I only gave them 3 stars because of the price.
B00BBF2VUA|5|Love the shirt
B005GXRCSE|5|Quality and price good....shipping as promised
B008Z6ISO6|5|This shirt arrived as advertised and was shipped very quickly.  It is a gift and I know the recipient will be so happy!!
B00GZK9J9M|5|Great socks!
B000VTMI64|4|I get all kinds of admiring glances from the ladies when I wear this. Although this tux has put my social life in high gear, I've still found time to launder it a few times and it has held up well so far.     I wore it to work yesterday and the boss kept staring at me, I'm hopeful that a promotion is in my near future.
B0055QNLR8|5|I both two compression sleeves and I'm really happy I did. They're comfortable and keep my knees stable, but the most important thing for me is that they don't rip. I'm very impressed with the quality of these sleeves. I highly recommend this product.
B00ISRWIHA|1|The image on the pillowcase is distorted. I bought this as a present and had it shipped, and I was quite embarrassed when I saw it at his house. Very dissatisfied with this product and also the length of time it took to have it delivered.
B00V32WI18|3|The dress is gorgeous but no way is it one size fits all...I'm a 12 and could not get over my arms.  My daughter who is a 2 said it was too tight for her.  Very tiny dress. ..wish it was spandex material instead
B008626Y2C|4|Fits great looks nice good buy for the price I paid for it and my daughter seems very warm in this nice looking coat
B00EIKS0YQ|5|love them
B00HRKAJZM|3|This might have been a smidge small on me. It zipped up fine but was too skin hugging for a professional setting.
B00A6HCOP6|4|Comfy, I love, these. Its more of a cotton spandex, stretchy fabric. I knew these were free size but they are large, so it will fit a large range of sizes. The ties are unfinished, so I just tied knots on the ends.
B008BNNA9G|5|I like it
B00OVBAGCG|5|Love!!
B00CLI6SLO|4|Great jeans just way too long! I love the way these jeans fit and there very comfortable. However, the length is ridiculous. I own many pairs of these and other similar brands and have never had any this long.
B00B6ECTKI|3|This is my first product from Dickie and my size is 3x which is what i got (3xt) the chest is a little snug the length barely reaches my belt (not a tall cut and it is 3xT) the sleeves are very long. a weird cut and I wouldnt recommend buying Dickie products unless you can try them on they are made in Mexico which explains the weird cut due to poor quality standards
B00N9S9SA8|3|It looks greatt for the price but I feel that size large fits 10-12, but it was too small.
B004M6UD46|5|Perfect Product
B00DQO5GLU|2|The coat looks way better in the picture than it is in reality.I won't say it is the worst buy but definitely not a great.I ordered a x-small as I am of a small fit.However the coat is much larger than what I expected esp the sleeves.The only way you can make winter clothes look good on you is when they fit right and this definitely does not cut out for that category.The coat is not a v-neck as it looks but has big collars that you need to press down to make it look even remotely close to what it seems in the picture.<br />The bright side is that the colour is good and if you intend to wear sweaters beneath then perhaps the size fits.Overall If I could, I would have given this product a pass.
B00328HRC6|4|Returned them as they were not the usual material of the jeans made by Alfred Dunner I get at another store.
B00CJ50P6S|5|I bought this for my daughter's ladybug themed birthday.  It's very cute!  The appliqué is 3d & tutu is fuller than expected.  I wish tutu had one more layer to look like a traditional tutu. Either way it's perfect & a great price for what you get.
B00IP8DBEG|5|These colors were just a little off but still great for the money.
B00GOL1NXW|1|ABSOLUTELY NOT WORTH THE TWO+ WEEKS I WAITED FOR SHIPPING.<br /><br />IT STATES IS AN EXTRA LARGE.  NO.  JUST NO.  THIS FIT MY 5 YEAR OLD NIECE.<br />BEWARE.
B00HLY1764|4|This definitely runs pretty large I sized down and ordered a medium and it was a little bit too loose on me and  a little bit too long.  I'm not sure if it is the material...maybe it is too stretchy and needs to have a little less stretch so it is more fitted and has less give....or maybe the size was just wrong for me.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 34D, athletic build, 37&#34;, 31.5&#34;, 40&#34;.  The cups were a little loose on me as well.  I was just about fitting in the cups so we will see if I size down what happens since I have a 34D bust.  Otherwise this is a really pretty piece.  I'm going to try ordering the small and see how that fits.  Fingers crossed!
B004R1I3XO|5|I bought a bunch of these to wear under my uniform shirt.  They are much more comfortable than cotton ones.  Plus it's a great price for 100% polyester t-shirt.  A Great Buy!
B0058YU990|5|This shirt was purchased for a gift and the person who received<br />it was very pleased with the appearance and the fit. It really<br />does seem to shed wrinkles and looks neat even after a day's<br />wear. I recommend it.
B004DNVP1S|5|These are very sharp looking trunks, with a white side stripe that looks great.  Will probably buy more in other colors.  Very satisfied.
B0051D4UQG|3|These jeans run a little smaller than most Lee jeans. In addition. I need the long because I am 5'10&#34;.  They are not nearly as long as Lee Riders I have bought in the past.  After being washed a couple of times, they will be too short.
B008F4HS1W|5|Love this jacket.  I wanted a lightweight trench-style belted rain jacket for travel that also doesn't look frumpy and this is exactly what I was looking for.  I'm 5'0&#34; and the length on the XS is perfect - comes down to mid thigh.  The twill/light beige color is great too.  Only downside is that this jacket isn't lined the seams are not sealed so water will eventually get in.  It should be labeled &#34;water-repellent&#34; and not &#34;waterproof.&#34;  This jacket is good for layering and weather above 50 degrees.
B000A3I3OW|4|Wrangler products are always well made and this one is no exception.  The sleeves are a little long and I wear 36-37 inch sleeves, but cuffs can be turned up if you like that look.
B0089XEF88|5|These were to go with her ballerina outfit and she just loves them. Made well and fit her very well.
B00B58TTOO|1|it is larger than the size that is described in size info.
B00161ANUO|2|too small
B003WXPADE|5|Perfect for my 12 year old's tye dye project!
B00HEUUB12|5|Has fleece inside! I'll save it for cold season... Good material!
B00WW8CYWU|5|I bought the red and black flowered one with the with background and the solid black one. I bought the red and black in a medium and the black one in a small. I'm 5' 7&#34; and 140 pounds with a size 28 inch waist. Both sizes fit well but the small does need to streach to fit me which I know will shorten the fabrics life, so future buys wi be medium. The fabric is a soft cotton blend with a good amount of streach so it fits like a loving glove. 😍 I will be buying more dresses from this buyer. Heres a tip too buy a petty coat to complete the look. And a corset to make it beautiful on the body. 😉
B006NO99DQ|5|I purchased the Fennco Ruffle Knit Infinity Loop Scarf in Chocolate Brown from Amazon.com.  This scarf is beautiful and luxurious.  The loop knitting keeps it from being too bulky when twisted and worn in a double loop.  It provides a great amount of warmth as well as impeccable style.  I would purchase this item in all three colors if your budget allows!  The price makes doing so effortless.  From office to dinner out on the town, or worn with jeans and a causual top for weekend adventures this show-stopper is sure to please for many seasons to come!
B00RYXBKAK|1|The sizing was incredibly incorrect. the adult medium was fit for a child.
B00NZJJP4U|5|Perfect Fit
B003L1QEIM|5|How can you not love this shirt? My daughter thought it ran just a litttle bit small but other than that it was perfect.
B00AJIRZT2|5|Good quality, great design, really smaller fit. On 8 years girl I took 10 and fits great. Thank you buyers for your rewes.
B007BG9Z66|4|Minions! Some say racist, I say awesome and hilarious... and also probably racist.
B00D1BIMTG|1|The decal started coming off after being washed one time!
B00L8WBCY2|5|I really love the way that this suit looks on me! The bottoms are very flattering and covers anything you don't want seen on the belly. I had twins 2 years ago and still have the stretch marks and a little loose skin to show for it, so the fact that the bottoms cover my whole stomach up to right under the breasts is nice. It reminds me of one of those 60's type swimsuits and looks nice with my big floppy hat. I'm 5'4 and weigh about 155, so I usually fit a size 10-12 in jeans or dresses, so if you're around this size in US sizing, and XXL would probably work for you as it did for me.
B00JYCFYPG|5|This suit fits great, looks amazing.  I was worried the plunge would gap but the suit stays put.  Very flattering.  I have this suit in pink too, but colors on this one make it even better.
B00O1GJUQY|5|Will buy  more
B002IREK22|2|The two things you have to watch out for are the size of the headpiece and also the relatively hard plastic of the puffed parts of the sleeves and bodice. The headpiece is so small it won't even fit on my baby's head. And the hard-ish plastic looks shiny, distinctly non Renaissance, incongruous with the rest of the garment. Not sending it back, but this is very very cheaply made..Will be trying to make my own headpiece, at least you can salvage the veil portion.
B000A38FZE|4|good sturdy material(a bit lighter weight than i expected, but not bad), well made, and above all, it fits. broad shoulders and long arms can be a pain finding long sleeve shirts.
B0030CTQZK|5|I bought this a while back and packed it in my suitcase for a month-long tour of Europe.  It is gorgeous and the quality is surprising for the low cost.  This kept me warm in the mountains when I wrapped it around my head and neck, as well as kept my head dry during misty, cold days in Holland.  It also decorated my shoulders nicely on cool evenings in Italy adding the right amount of color and pizzazz to a plain black dress.  Very happy with it and will get many years of use out of.
B002WBRQ7U|3|I've bought this sea lion pajama along with Totoro/Pikachu Japanese cartoon character pajamas and one monkey footie pajama together from different brands. This sea lion sure looks cute and you can also choose to put your hands in the sea lion paws or let your hands out. There're two pockets as well. It fits good on me and I'm 5'6/130LBS. The problem I had with this pajama is that the material feels kind of stiff and it smells really really bad. I've compared it with others I've bought and all of them except this one feel really soft and odorless. Although I'll wash them before wearing anyway, the smell made me very unpleasant and it's not very comfortable to wear. I would not put this right on my skin, so I ended up returning it and kept others.
B0057X9Q3C|5|love these shirts. wear great, wash great, perfect for me being in a wheelchair, and easy to care for. wish could get more in wider variety of colors.
B00DUJBEJE|5|My husband thought it was hilarious and it fit exactly as I expected.
B009W1HRLI|3|my girlfriend was interested in this. it's a bit small, but looks good on her.
B002TLTS8I|3|I am fine with the quality. However, my daughter is 4, and these size six undies leave little room for growth. She is tall and thin, so these run small. Also, the colors advertised were not what we received. Wouldn't have been a big deal except that two pairs were blue so she has relegated those to her younger brother.
B009WHVPQU|5|This scarf is not silk, but it is absolutely beautiful.  A lot of weight to it, sewn beautifully.  Well worth the price!
B00NI5Q012|5|Very happy with our purchase!
B001IBHONG|2|The wallet is leather outside and plastic inside. No double snap closure. It feels really cheap inside. Dissapointed. The color is lovely, though.
B003CT9IM2|4|Vest fits perfectly but it came apart on my way to Austin from Houston. The strings came out of the side while I was riding on the freeway all most lost the vest. Had to buy tennis shoe strings and put it back together.
B00CSJ5APQ|2|this outfit is so cute and i was excited for my neice to wear it, but the jacket zipper was broken and the pants had a hole in them.
B0087LXBZU|5|Super nice and thin I recommended it ...Its cheap and was ship fast ...I get a lot of compliment ..was worth it
B00F6IOCTG|4|The first of these onesie costume we received was so good that we decided to order a second one to present as a gift. Well, the size of the second one was too small, and we had no way to prove it because the size was not listed on the invoice. Also, the unicorn one was no longer available. So yes, the costume is funny, soft and cuddly, but be careful with the sizing.
B00CB84PHS|5|This top is very flattering on your body after having a little one. I really like all of the colors. I have all 4.
B00DC8GHHW|5|When I got this blouse. I thought WOW this is a great looking blouse. I will be wearing this with leggings and boots for fall. It is some what light and if fits me perfectly. Thank you. Peace.
B00ZLN7LGM|1|Terrible. Cheap and poorly out together. Nothing like the picture!! Sent it back.
B00Q9GB7L0|5|good jeans.
B008G7BNNW|3|not as heavy as i was expecting,i am a little disipointed with this vest,next time i will go to the local store
B00XQG585W|4|I was a little skeptical about the ability of this item to block RFID readers. So, I wasn't too disappointed when I found that it did not block RFID readers at all. It looks nice, is basically functional, and I may get some use out of it. But, it is not an RFID blocking wallet. To be clear, I bought the money clip style wallet, and tested each of the compartments using an HID card and the RFID reader at my office. Alpine Swiss is folllowing up with me and providing great support. I appreciate that they are backing what they sell. Thanks!
B00CC6ZVTU|3|Received this today, have yet to wash and put on my 4mo. The quality of the vest and pants make me nervous. It is kind of a fleecey material that I think will not wash well. I am not sure but at first glance, I have to admit that I probably would not have purchased if I saw it in the store. I will post an update once I have washed and baby has worn. Size appears correct and it is super cute.
B0030DFCZW|5|dockers are always great looking and fitting.
B00KMCB5LY|4|White fits fine. For some reason, the grey one doesn't although same size. Rubs under armpits. After a few washes it's a bit better but still not as comfy as my black and white ones.
B004GCXRKI|5|I had never heard of or seen these socks until  I saw my sister wearing them. She told how great they wear, especially on cold days. I looked them up on Amazon and low an behold you had &#34;Toe Socks&#34;. I beg and buying them they were a Great, then along came the daughters and low and behold when they left so did my socks! So, I will be back for some this winter! Thank you Very Much.
B0051D8GUW|4|They're advertised as 83% cotton and the pair I received is only 70%…what's up with that ?
B00M3NKDM2|3|Nice shirt just way too small. My daughter wears a med and the 2x fit her.
B00E0DZY9A|5|nice product thanks.
B00I1LV5MM|3|I like Hurley board shorts.  This style has two things I'm happy about which is the reason for the the 3 star.  First, the color on the image has more contrast than what the product actually looks like.  It almost looks like one color in person.  Second, I thought they would be a little longer, but the waist does fit as expected.
B003ZUOPSU|4|Tie was as described ...my son liked it.
B00BJ9QUWI|2|I returned this scarf because the color was much too bright - not &#34;soft pastel&#34; as advertised.
B003IFA89W|4|I got this dress as my winter formal dress and I ended up wearing it to my band concert too. this dress is so versatile to the point when I could not wearing it strapless anymore at formal I could change it and make it more comfortable for me and when I need a cute comfortable semi dressy dress this is the one for you. I didn't like the way the material sticks to tights and doesn't always look good when you need it to; I would like it a lot more if it didn't stick to them or the exes material when your making your dress the way you want shows that gets annoying too. all in all its a good dress and you should get it for summer not winter like I did because trying to keep warm doesn't always work.
B00KRE1DOQ|4|Well made and good fit.
B00B6UEN7Y|5|I enjoy wearing the turban when I don't feel like doing my hair,, its so easy to put on and wears well ALL day,, THANKS
B00IE94H8K|5|This is one of the best clothing set (Top & short) both fit nicely on my boys. Ordered T2 for my 21mths boy and T4 for my 3yrs 3mths boy. Will purchase other Nannette clothing set for them again.
B00QHEJOR8|4|Great sox, but run smaller.  I am size 10 1/2 or 11 and these just fit near my ankle.
B00P1FPROS|5|Love it! Very comfy
B00QKOQW6G|5|Really cute outfit, nice and loose for a cruzing crawling baby.
B00KI2TPV0|5|Very cute dress. Bought it for my granddaughters babtism.  It's adorable and so very soft!
B00PBJVQ1M|5|Very cute and fit is perfect!
B00KIJTGWG|5|Great quality, just barely made it in time though.
B0008EZFYE|5|just what i wanted they are great and good quailty.
B00PZVBNJ6|4|I love the pattern all of eVogue styles are super cute. beware though that the sizes run much smaller than you are used to. I agree with other posters that you should order up a size from what you regularly wear.
B004QF0TFQ|5|i got this for my husband and he likes it a lot~ specially the fact that the soles are thick and his feet feels dry all day long.
B00KO1NVG0|1|The size was much smaller then the stated size, I ordered an XXL but it was more like a medium.  This dress was very disappointing because it did not look like the picture at all, completely different!
B00ICMDZWS|5|Too cute
B00E4NM9LW|4|This dress was beautiful and the fit was fine. I like my dresses a little more fitted in the waist since that's my greatest asset. This was my for time ordering from eshakti. I will order from them again but depending on the style of the dress I may get a smaller size.
B00A0GLAM6|5|Awesome mask, as expected
B002LSI34Y|5|These work pants were purchased for the color and side pockets.<br />The material seem very durable as well as the zipper and buttons.<br />The side pockets have been exceedingly helpful. The left side pocket fits close to the leg and is opened by a slit a couple of inches (1 1/2 &#34;?) long - which is perfect for either my Identification wallet or my box opener. The right side leg pocket billows out and closes securely with a snap. I keep pen, paper, lip gloss or other needs. There are also pockets at the common hip and back side locations.<br />The length and fit are perfect for me.
B00K5JXNN2|5|great
B00594G08I|5|I like argyle.  I like socks.  I like argyle socks.  I like these socks, they are comfortable and feel like quality socks.  They are more expensive than the bundles, but they look better and feel better so I think its worth it.
B00SY3L9J6|4|I love this shirt, but I'll be wearing a camisole under since it's quite a plunging neckline.
B00MGNJL5Y|5|I didn't have much expectations for this dress as I had read the reviews. But I thought this would make a nice nighty to sleep in. The quality of the fabric is better than I had expected. It's thicker than I thought it would be, and isn't see through. I ordered 2 of these, one in blue, a Large, and a white one in Medium. They both fit me nice. The white fits more fitting than the blue but that is because of they are different sizes. I bought this to use as a nighty, but it's nicer than I thought so I wore it as an outfit. I wore a blazer with it, and it looked lovely. I'm sure I will be wearing this around the house a lot this Summer. I wear a size 2, for reference, and am 5'6&#34;.
B009SGW492|4|It goes well with casual jeans or business skirts.  Attached scarf (more like bow) is quite big (maybe not for a woman with a endowed chest).  Armholes are smaller side, which I like.
B001T8MB5Y|2|Nice, but ran large
B0013CQQBQ|5|It looks just like the picture, if you like what you see, buy this.
B00KZZ8PHU|4|Coat looks good on my wife. She loved it too. It is little small than expected. but manageable.
B00LHR7R92|4|Bought this for the hubby. He liked it and it looked great on him but it snags easily. Snagged first time he wore it and had to pull the string inside the shirt in order to avoid putting a whole in it.
B0057VTQSE|5|I'm always skeptical when buying cashmere sweaters online. In the past the ones I bought turned out to be extremely thin. But the price was too good to pass so I took a risk. This one is just about right. The quality is nice and the sweater is thicker and finer than any others you would buy at higher prices at places like Macy's or Land's End. The size fits me perfectly - I'm 5'10\\" & 170 p and the large is a good fit.
B003LS1K5W|4|This wig was purchased to finish off my daughter's Halloween costume as Princess Zelda. I received the item within the time period indicated just in time for Halloween. This item was purchased for an 8 year old even though it's made for an adult. I'd say it fits well for a child's head. I guess it depends on how big your child's head is too. I believe the length to be shorter than shown. However it did meet the need of my daughter and she liked it for about 20 minutes and then she complained that it was making her scalp itch. What can I say, she's 8. I don't know if it would have made a difference if she were to have worn a wig cap. I did ordered one from a different company but it didn't arrive until 2 days after Halloween. The color is also true to the photo. I didn't have to detangle it at all. They must put some kind of adhesive or something to keep all the strands together really well. I would definitely recommend this for any costume party and I would order from this company again. I hope this helps.  P.S. - I'm keeping this wig for next year!
B000MTRQ8I|3|I love my leather jacket!  I was afraid that it would be too big when I bought it because I wear a 1X in jackets and coats and only a 2x was available.  I took a chance and ordered it anyway and am thrilled I did!  This jacket fits wonderfully and although it says 2x it's reallly a 1x.  My advice is to take the chance and order the bigger size, it just might fit and the jacket looks great.
B0034M396S|5|very good product
B00CUZSTO2|5|bought this as a gift for my husband and he loved it. washes well and does not fade after washing
B00EP9CT5G|3|Bought this for our two year old boy.. The t-shirt fits him we'll but the short are too big for him. He's a reasonably built little guy, so I expected it to fit perfectly.<br />I'm very happy with the t shirt, nice color, good fit and good quality material too..<br />The pants on the other hand, not a good fit, material not so good, expected it to be softer..<br />I'm gonna pair this t-shirt up with some other pants and just put these shorts away..
B00N34DA2K|4|For a plus size product XXL doesn't fit as expected.  Hence, given four stars.  Anyway, it's a nice top.
B0027FE4ZI|2|THEITEMS SMEELS VERY NICE BUT IT IS CHEAPLY MADE.  THE FABRIC IS VERY SEE THROUGH AND THE SIZES RUN SMALL.  IF YOUR A SMALL GET A MEDIUM.
B003RCJA0O|5|These socks are very thick and warm. Just what I was looking for to help me fit some boots that were a little large.
B009IRF8GW|5|Nice product... good colors.... good price  and decent length. Would make a really nice gift for a man or woman!
B007R8P4OA|5|Great hiking sock, thick, but not too thick. Double lined socks seemed to do the job.  I bought them because I was getting alot of blisters from long hikes.  I hiked 8 miles in brand new shoes with these socks and had no blisters.  fast shipping. good product
B00IOW5ZU6|5|Thick, durable material.  My son loves these shorts!
B0046MCQAA|5|I followed the advice of some other reviewers and purchased one size larger than I usually wear. Following a wash and a run through the dryer, the boxers fit without binding.  I prefer the feel of silk or satin boxers rather than cotton or nylon, and this is the best price I have seen recently for good quality satin boxers.
B006WFG7VS|5|Nice slim fit shirt..  I am 168lbs and I purchased the medium. If you want to make a fashion statement [nice black size panels] this is a great slim fit shirt...it  is nice and smooth and expensive looking.  Would highly recommend.
B00MGNIY98|4|Very cute.
B00UXFRTM4|3|Came within 2 weeks but did not come with the straps.<br />Cute and fit ok but returning for lack of straps.
B00MXBWBLA|5|This is a beautiful well made dress. It is a good quality cotton knit. Very simple and exquitely sophisticated. Wish they made this in adult sizes.  Dress it up with a belt and you are good to go.
B00OFNSWCQ|3|I am a 44D, I bought the biggest size hoping to find a sports bra that would actually work. It is extremely see thru. It isn't as tight as I was hoping (wanted my boobs to be tight against my chest) but this is a pretty comfortable bra
B008GSB52U|4|I ordered this for my daughter as a Christmas present.  She loves it.  Not sure why they have it listed as a mans wallet, since it's obviously for a female.  The wallet is very stylish and just perfect for a young lady.
B00KHEAJCS|5|Very nice gift
B00COPM1VU|2|It started tearing and getting holes during first time trying it on. Too bad since its cute.
B008SOISMW|3|I was a little disappointed that when this shirt came it was a bright orange based red, not a dark cool red (burgundy). I don't know if this is a language issue or a shipping mistake as it came from over seas. I wouldn't want to mess with shipping things back and forth simply due to the distance, so buyer beware.<br /><br /> It's the quality one would expect for the price. All of that aside it fits like the picture, keep in mind the way the model is holding her arms-- it's long sleeved. And when I put it on today with the rest of my outfit I decided that I absolutely love it. I'm giving it three stars because warmness/coolness and brightness are pretty important as far as whether or not something will suit you is concerned.
B00NKKJ25G|5|Wears well!
B00E2RRUKU|4|great looking pair of undies, just wish the 6-pack would have been in 6 different colors, not just 3.  but nice fit
B000J28J02|3|Good quality but felt they ran a bit small.
B0041LBNHI|3|This and the red scotty fleece coat in infant and toddler sizes (I purchased a 24 mos. and a 2T) have snaps instead of button closures, as listed in the garment descriptions. The \\"buttons\\" on the red scotty dog coat are very cheap black shiny plastic.  The brown version looks classier all in all, as the little black dots on the red scotty one don't match the vertical opening perfectly, but the scatterd circles on the brown coat don't have to be symmetrical to look right. The flower detail is much more nicely done.    I am sending the coats with Thanksgiving and Christmas outfits to my granddaughter, so I'm not sure if it's cumbersome to snap together the opening to get the garment on a toddler or not. I think a different closure would have been nicer, but with everything being made in China, I guess this is the future!    Another thing to think about is the hats. The 24mos. hat is visually smaller than the 2T hat, although the coats themselves appear just about the same size. The 2T coat is a little wider across the midsection, but the same length. If your child has a large head and you're trying to decide between sizes, definitely go with a larger size range. The hats are very cute, so you wouldn't want to miss your little one wearing this accessory! :)    All in all, for the price, it's a nice coat for temperate climes.  It is like a light fleece jacket for adults in thickness, so it wouldn't be good in very cold weather.
B00OY7Z7H6|1|NOT
B008REU16E|3|It took forever to arrive. Looked nice when it did but I had ordered it for a three month old baby to wear in a wedding and it was way too big! there are is no way to adjust it so it slipped right over her head and down to her neck. OK for toddler.
B00ZEJFICC|5|I really like these. Probably a favorite.
B003ODIDQI|2|One thing I can say I wasn't disappointed in with this costume was the actual dress.  That's what made me want to buy it, essentially.  But in most places you aren't allowed to try the accessories on, & I imagine if you're ordering it, well you don't have any way to guess if the accessories will fit.  Thing is, it looks like the accessories were just thrown in there all mismatched.  I got one glove that fit for the most part, but the other glove would fit someone who has a much larger hand.  Everything in the package I bought should of been to match a small.  The mask looks awkward (makes me notice now how they have the edges of it covered by the model's hair), & feels awkward, & the boot covers don't fit well at all.  Oh, & the worst part were the tights.  The tights were child tights.  Sure they fit my legs, but wouldn't even reach my butt, much less fit over it.  & I'm 5'4\\", 125 lbs.  I wish I could of just bought the dress for a percentage of the entire set, & had the saved money to go buy seperate accessories that fit & were well made.  Now I just have to spend extra money to do that.  Atleast I know now that this brand is as cheap as they look.  If only they charged what they're worth.
B00KLQHPUQ|1|This might fit a 6-7 year old girl.  Definitely not for a small lady.
B00ECIFO8E|5|Great item! Quick shipping!
B00UHDGEGY|5|love it
B00KDRP4GU|5|SlideBelt has, apparently, two levels of quality of leather for their belts.  This one is of the higher quality.  I already owned a couple of the regular quality belts, and wanted one in this color, which doesn't seem to be available in the regular quality.  The regular quality is quite good, and this is even better.  The edges have stitching and the leather has a very nice natural surface on it.<br />The SlideBelt closing system is great because it is very secure and doesn't leave marks on the face of the belt if you don't clip it in the same place each time.
B00G0B5MI8|1|Way to small. Poor quality. Wouldn't recommend. Don't waste your time !
B00KGSCOX2|5|Great fit and great style
B000I20XSE|3|I bought these for my sister and I.  We were very excited about them coming in the mail.  Upon arrival we were very pleased with the chaps, nicely made but alas they were too small.  I'm in the process now of returning them and will be ordering the next size up.
B0018QAKJQ|5|Perfect design, I like the fabric material, does not wrinkle and keeps the pleats and seams. This is a stand out mens wear for formal, semi formal, casual and semi casual ocassions/events.
B004Q0M3OQ|5|I bought this T-Shirt as a gift from my 2 Boxer boys for my husband for Father's Day, this T-Shirt looks just like one of our boys- just love it
B00AIR8QPG|5|I bought this for my 4 & 5 year old boys and purposely bought it bigger to allow for washing shrinkage and growing room to last throughout the warm season. The shorts are good quality and the t-shirts are also a good quality as well. Would purchase again but don't think I will need to because it should hold up for a while.
B00HJZL7FG|4|Awesome!
B009HIQRQC|5|Love the top. It fits perfect. I think I will enjoy it.  Great material beautiful pattern.<br />I could only find it on Amazon.
B00C5AL584|5|Run just a bit small, but still love them. Pricing perfect. I use them when I wear backless dresses or tops. Adhesive works well, except if you start perspiring too much. Searched and found Amazon had the best price
B00JVL6KLC|1|do not order, they gave me the complete wrong length and color. i received bright red(like ariel) and it came just past my shoulders
B00IXQKFEE|4|very nice
B0073MLZ70|5|My husband loved it! Thank you, Amazon.com!!!
B003376NAS|5|Good
B008Q7TVRM|5|i give this five stars. The color was great and it fit perfectly. I will get this in all the other colors
B00KD5AXDG|5|I love these. Soft and cute. I have 3 packs of their different styles. Can't wait for baby to get here and use them.
B00L287AD4|4|Beautiful lightweight coat, but a narrow fit. I tried going up 1 size and it was still too small. Just going to send it back.
B00GJ8DLGC|3|One of the pairs is gray, not navy...
B00BRJU34Q|3|Fits alittle small but it says on tag Junior Fit but is strechy
B00M4DA2RC|5|great
B00DC7DXV6|5|Hilarious shirt would make a great gift
B00CLVEP8O|4|Nice ugly sweater.  However it was bit large for a medium.  The sweater may be itch somewhat, however a washing it may fix that.
B001OGRCK0|4|Nice!
B00WF8NIDG|3|These pants are too short.  I am 5' 8,&#34; 160lbs.  I bought the large and it was floating above my ankles when at my waist. When I pulled them down, the crotch was too long. I intended to wear these out, but now can only wear at home.  The fabric is soft and comfortable  but thin, though no underwear see through.
B00CEM3YNC|5|This is the belt I've been waiting for for the last 20 years. It's perfect because it's adjustable, it's stretchable, and it's flat in the front so you don't have a big bulge at your waistline. The clasp is plastic so I'm not sure how long it's going to last. So far, 2 weeks, it seems fine. It'll be great going through security at the airport! It's all plastic and elastic. Highly recommended.
B00HQ1SSBE|2|cheap, but sizes are inconsistent
B00FJW1Z80|5|good
B00O1TZ9TI|5|Whoa momma this was hot! Unfortunately it was supposed to be a surprise and my husband opened thinking it was his wallet shipment...ugg. Some how even delivered all folded up in a plastic bag, he still immediately knew it was a naughty outfit...men have radar like that. Another reviewer mentioned scratchy material: the bands are black with a metallic silver threading that is not super soft. It didn't really bother me, but I am on the small/medium side (size 4-6). I could see if you were much bigger, the material cutting in a bit more. Tricky to get on the first time figuring out where all the straps go, but love the triple strap on the bikini line. Thinking of getting their Lucianna  Babydoll Dress next
B00JUM953M|4|These are definitely beefy and definitely tall.  I ordered the &#34;large-tall&#34; size, but I think I might be more of a &#34;medium-tall&#34; guy with this brand.  Overall, they fit well and maybe they'll shrink down a bit with a few washes.
B00460544M|2|I have rather large hands, and as such, I was looking for a 3XL leather insulated glove for dress/driving in winter.  I ordered these gloves because the description was exactly what I was looking for.  However, when they arrived, they were so small I couldn't even squeeze my hands into them.  We're talking O.J. crime gloves here.  I ended up giving them as a gift to my dad, who normally wears an XL glove, and they fit him fine.  They are nice gloves, but the sizing was very inaccurate.
B006J3Q1KK|5|Color is a lot darker than expected by my daughter loves it!!!
B00Q3J7NPM|5|Very happy with this seller, Would definitely use again.
B005OSQW9Q|5|Very nice silk, quality is perfect. But anyway, a very good thing. Bought it for groom's friends for our wedding!
B000N8X1HI|5|No complaints from my son.
B00KDC8A8Y|2|Lose, but I can tell if i order a small it will do the job
B000JBZ686|4|nice basic mesh short
B00BR0FPZC|5|Just as advertised - nice product.  Bright color.
B00D3E1PIQ|5|I like it, simple and classy<br />soft material, fits as expected
B009W65BIO|5|I'm always wary of buying Juniors clothing even if plus sizes are available since you never know what you'll get. I normally wear a size 18/20 depending on the brand and this was my first time ordering from this company. After reading reviews I went with the 22 plus. They are SO comfortable. I probably could have gone with the next size down if I wanted a closer fit, but overall I wasn't swimming in loose fabric. They are not jeans, but thicker than tights or leggings so I can wear them at work. They did get a little loose in the waist/butt after the course of the day, but not to the point that they were falling off (or looking like diapers as I've seen others have happen) and since I wear longer tops I doubt it was noticeable anyway. I wish there were some real pockets but otherwise I'm very happy I got these and will be trying others from WallFlower.
B0002LI7C0|4|too small because i choose the wrong size after i order i really know my size was 38 DD so
B004S5JEPK|5|Fits great! Really love the look of this cap. Nice for cool weather days.
B00QWTTTMI|1|very tiny
B00HYU0MUM|5|However, we liked the outfit so much and it is so well made and adorable that I re-ordered in the next size and will pass on the smaller size to a cousin, who also adored the outfit.  Will definitely purchase from Kids Headquarters again.  High quality and reasonably priced.
B0049W2Z5I|5|not too cheap of a t-shirt material, looks like it may last awhile. worth the money. I would recommend it.
B00HJIXLC0|5|Is just a belt and it does the work of holding up my pants! That's all that a belt should do! Besides that, is a nice belt, is made of cotton so is very soft and the buckle works just fine!
B00LMDQ7RY|5|love these, great fit, I'm a size 12
B00N503M66|5|Thanks!
B00BY085B6|5|Love the floral print! Fits great. It has pockets which is awesome. Not crazy about the belt but it is detachable.
B002UHKNN0|5|Beautiful dress for those social functions where you would like to leave an underwhelming but confident impression. I have bought it for my cousin..but it looks so classy that it hurts a little bit parting with it :) Fabric is little on the stiff side!
B00KGFFOSW|1|Completely see through. You could see my butt crack when i wore this. I had to go out and buy a really long slip just to make it wearable!
B00JRKHIG8|5|shoulders and bust run a bit tight for a medium which is what I would buy in a store.  It says rust, but it has golden threads in it.  IT IS BEAUTIFUL.
B005S54CZQ|5|I'm very happy with the product!!! I use it for different reasons than is supposed to be used for!!! I use it under my sweat suit!!! Really makes me sweat!!!
B0091CVX4U|4|Gets the job done, and definitely worth the price.
B00JXMF6U0|2|These pants are huge. Comfy but gigantic.
B00M7KT8DQ|2|But its pretty
B00816RZJ4|5|great colors fit my 6 yr old perfectly really good undershirts
B004D98NKI|5|Perfect fit!
B00NNFP28O|1|Very disappointed overall ~
B00AWQSAQI|4|It didn't have in the description about it being a underwire. I like how it fits but I don't like the underwire.
B00FA5R6U2|5|You never know what to expect when you order a costume online and typically its less then desired quality. This snowman outfit is fantastic! Great quality I couldn't have asked for a better product. very very pleased. I rarely write reviews this is review worthy!
B001AY0WVC|4|If you are a fan of trunk style underwear for men, but want them to stay in place and not ride up on you, then this is the product. They also wear well even after many, many washes. I only gave them 4 stars because I wish they offered different colors.
B0027VT5UG|2|This is supposed to be an adult costume, but it is so narrow and short I'm not sure who it would fit.  The quality is very poor also.  It's a shame, because it's a really cute pattern.  I sent it back.
B004EBV4P6|5|I have gotten a million compliments on this hat, and for the price it is an incredible deal!  The way the straw fades into black is adorable, and it kept the sun out of my eyes during the float trip I bought it for.  No sun burn for me!
B0008EKW60|5|I purchases several nursing bra's trying to find just the right one. This one is by far the most comfortable and the easiest to nurse in.
B004FZY16A|5|Perfect
B000E8FROC|2|Advertised as crushable. I took that to mean durable. It means you will crush it out of shape
B000RZ7BNW|5|very nice, would buy it again as a gift for him.  Nice color selection and nice material, very sturdy material
B003JK2RNG|3|Came on time. The tank tops are in perfect new condition but I find they are a little too short and wide. By the time it would fit width ways, it will be too short. But will keep and use as under shirt.
B00HUH8LP2|3|I Liked too much
B00CBSZ1GW|4|This is really a cute set. The top is not scratchy and is even cuter in real life than the picture. The pants are thinner than I wanted for winter, but they work out more as leggings.
B008NUV6G6|3|A cute suit but it doesn't have a lot of support. Flattered the hips but not the stomach too much.
B00H9ALJX6|2|ordered a 28 in these, not knowing what size in this brand and I am usually a 27-28 in 7FAM and Paige.  These were HUGE all around.  I can't comment on length since it didn't really stand out one way or the other to me (5'4&#34;), but the hips and thighs were very large fitting for a 28 that's supposed to be skinny. (36&#34; hips and I had a good 3&#34; on either side).  I also felt they were thinner and thus more see-through than the 7FAM and Juicy white jeans I ordered at the same time.
B00JXVKQO2|3|Wished it was longer, but very comfortable
B00UI1EWT6|5|Lots of compliments on this little jacket. Love the colour.
B00DEQQNX0|5|love it, so cute. there's room for all my stuff. the color is a nice color it's well made. happy i made this purchase.
B0042P9WEO|4|Length a little longer than pictured
B000G7CD6Q|5|All Carhartts are sized differently no matter where you buy them and always have.  Be careful that you know what size you wear for each different style before ordering.  We knew ahead of time which style size we wanted, and amazon saved us the 60 mile drive to the nearest CalRanch to purchase these.  This particular style is the closest to the hub's actual size.  They are PLENTY long.  That being said. Carhartts are the only pants I buy my husband.  They are as tough as they say. You can walk through a field of burrs and not feel them, and they are great in the snow.  Highly recommended as long as you know your size, because EVERY STYLE IS DIFFERENT.
B007OWEEU4|4|These are well made and were well rec'd as a xmas gift.  Arrived quickly and was packaged well.  Construction was very nice.
B00DMORUM2|4|I'm giving four stars cause I thought the material was different. Otherwise the dress is beautiful. I would recommend you. Everyone loved her dress.
B001VBXB6M|4|I wish they would have stayed within the guidelines of the stretch material.  It extends beyond the fabric point and not hidden as described.
B00DYCIPEO|5|Very cute! The color of it is even more beautiful in person. My daughter loved !
B00G03O2XC|5|Love this it's my favorite. It's so soft and warm nice for this winter season.
B00E0G38KE|5|Love the magnetic closure!  My 3 month old (who is in the 50th percentile) has plenty of room to grow into the 6M size.  He's 14lbs and it's still slightly too big.  I love the quality of the cotton fabric and the cute fabric!
B00NR8MU50|3|Very Very Large...I am Plus size and I was SWIMMING in this
B002XXRVQI|4|I found this shawl a good weight.  It is perfect for cold air-conditioned rooms!  I carry it along so I can cover up when needed.
B00XL1HRJC|5|Just what I was looking for. Very happy.
B006PAN63C|2|The tee was nearly see through so the material was very flimsy and an excess use of glitter which now fall off at the slightest touch, not very good at all.
B00T5GMZ4Y|4|Nice fit but a little thin and clingy.
B000ULXXGM|5|Great product and fast service.
B00M31HBAQ|4|Nice looking and comfortable leggings, but if you buy them, consider getting some lint remover roles too :)
B001G6KFL6|4|This costume is not high end.  But I will get several uses out if it.  I love Star Wars and this worked great for Halloween. I will be using it again just to play.  The body is just a jumpsuit with some padding.  The helmet is two pieces of thin plastic.
B001UC7Q7W|5|This is the beanie mask I mentioned in my Rorschach figure review. 1st things 1st, this is not a \\"toy\\" Amazon, this is a piece of appearl. I have 2 reasons I'm getting this mask over the other ones. 1st of all, it's much cheaper, 2nd it has my favorite inkblot design on it. If you look at it today (the day this review was written) everywhere where it is supposed to be white is a light gray. The real product is nothing like that. All that grayish color is proper white. To answer your question, no this doesn't come in any other inkblot patterns. It also can be a ski hat if you ever so disire. I plan to get this but I recomend it if you just want a basic Rorschach mask.
B00AAJIRUQ|4|They are very nice and dressy. Could use a little more lining for warmth.
B001KWHT42|1|This product does not one thing that it claims I bough a medium it not easy to get on and it's non binding it does nothing to your body consider donating your money before buying this crap
B00DDR0HKK|2|This bra is beautiful!!! Way way way too small! Really with it fit better.
B00HHIA8J6|5|these leggings are amazing. they are warm and thick, which mean you don't have to worry about others being able to see through them. i am 5'4 and 155lbs, and I usually wear a size 13 in pants and these leggings fit PERFECTLY.
B00ACIGRNO|5|Good price, good product.
B00I8RJ5AS|1|The shirt fell apart upon first washing
B00WVZXU68|5|Great hat and very well made
B00OHZES3O|4|Very comfortable. Length great and I'm 5'10.
B000N8X86W|2|I ordered these a while back and when I first received them and tried them on I was a little surprised by how dark, tight, and stiff they were but seeing as how I only had a few pair of jeans I thought they'd get broken in, I was wrong. It's about 1 year later now and these jeans are still super dark (almost black) and are just as rigid (I was hoping that Dickies would be a bit more comfortable) and not all that strong for being so rigid, I can feel the denim wearing much faster than my Wranglers I've had forever.<br /><br />Anyways, the first time I washed them and dried them the length shrunk about 2 inches and the waist came in about 1 inch. While the waist part got me to lose a few pounds the length drove me nuts. Everywhere else I'm a 32 inseam and with Dickies it's looking like I need to get a 34 or 36 inseam just to make these jeans look decent.
B00ZEE2I0C|4|This was purchased as a gift. We ordered a size larger than she would normally wear as per other reviews. Fits just right for the most part. Will need to be taken in slightly at the top. She was very happy with it.
B0019RSR7G|4|In 2010 I took a Barmah hat to Sturgis. Coming from Australia to the USA, and intending to ride a motorcycle, I knew luggage space was going to be a big issue. I also knew I was coming from mid winter into Summer. So I need a wide brim hat. Barmah had just what I was looking for. I'd recommend a dark coloured hat, though. As you sweat alot wearing them...and sweat stains on the tan coloured hat, are impossible to wash out...still the company policy says what it does keeps its shape...kind of...
B00AB75ZXO|1|My son get pair from the same seller and I liked them, so I decided to order pair for me. My gloves came with velcro strap not on the picture. But I would be ok with it, if material inside of the glove would not have bumps, pockets, etc... very uncomfortable.<br /><br />waist of money.
B00T838KUM|5|Love it...
B005444EEU|5|My first Carhartt jacket. Just what i expected at a very good price.
B00KRYLOLS|5|Fine
B00C7XH4CA|5|Excellent
B00188J6MQ|4|The product was good. The only problem I had was with the shipping as I had asked for the items to be shipped together whenever in stock and I received them in patches. Thanks
B00HNNROHY|5|Bought this for my husband on our wedding day. It looked so nice!
B00BCYDKVE|3|I ordered this for my son to wear for his first birthday party last week. Unfortunately, it was much, much too large and I had to return it. He wears 12 month size in Carter's clothes, but I wasn't sure how the sizing for Mud Pie clothes compared. So for those of you thinking of ordering this, my son is about 21 lbs and 29 inches in height and it was huge on him.<br />However, aside from the size, I can say it is of good quality and very cute. Too bad it did not work out for us.
B00E9HV3M4|1|I had to return this products because the cups were way too small. I would go with a higher cup size.
B00CJD3WXS|5|Excellent  Fall and winter Skirt Love the Fit as well I would re opder it in Black when it becomes available
B00DXYYUR4|5|Perfect fit and adorable shirt for anyone who loves the minions.
B00JRDJ3OA|5|Bought this as a holiday dress.... when i opened the package and held it up to see the details, i was amazed at how much better this dress looked in person. The colors were so vivid and the sequin neckline just sparkled wonderfully. Fits well, has a good amount of stretch to it as well. I love this dress!!!! Will buy another but in a different pattern.
B00L9XU6VA|4|Fit is good. Decent shirt/quality for the money.
B001G1QMJA|5|I used the Amazon size guidelines and had my chest measured.  Ordered the large, and it fits great.  The jacket is of excellent quality.  I ordered the brown by mistake, but upon arrival, noticed that the brown is almost black.  It works for both colors.  The brown comes out when wearing brown, and it looks black when wearing black.  Now I don't need to buy another jacket.
B00J2HHLJK|5|love it!!!
B00HFQM19K|2|The back is so sheer, you can see through it! I put it on, and thought I could see a little too much.  I took it off and held my hand under the material while slightly stretching it, and I could totally see my finger nails and everything.  I can only imagine how bad it would be when it is wet. I thought the gathering of the material would give it a little more structure, but it doesn't. It is super cute though.<br />I'm debating if it is worth keeping and just wearing shorts over it, or if I'm going to go through the process of returning it.
B006LKR59W|3|This dress is just OK.....though I wouldn't purchase this again.The fabric looks a lot cheaper than I expected.The appliqués are nice however.
B00NADOMNK|5|The product was exactly as promised and in the time promised!
B003DKO2MG|5|I don't like carrying thick wallets and always use a debit card for my daily transactions.  This is a slim answer to a wallet and much more striking than a moneyclip.  Very happy with this.
B0046Y3U6W|1|Poor quality stitching and material. Either the machine that made these is broken or the person who did just wasn't paying attention. The white armor pieces are sewn in partially over the fingers instead of over the top of the hand, and they aren't even sewn on straight. On top of that, it seems like they were accidentally sewn on the wrong side of the hand due to how they fit (like putting on a glove upside down). Unusable garbage. You'd be better off using just black gloves and a piece of white construction paper taped to the top.
B004VO7UJA|2|The socks produced heavy lint and appear well worn after the first normal wear. Not willing to buy this kind of item again.
B00B7GL1MC|5|Excellent purchase. Hard to find these colors.
B005VVS6E0|4|Cute, exactly what's advertised. I have a 37&#34; waist and bought the medium, it works great.
B0055R0JAY|5|I have had my Nike Free Run+2 running shoes for about 2 months now, and I love them.  Prior to my Nike Free Run+2 running shoes, I only wore Nike Shox for running.  I believe the Free Run+2 is the superior running shoe.  They have a barefoot feel to them with the added benefits of the support a running shoe gives you.  I am not an avid runner, but I wear my Free Run+2 shoes not only for workouts, but also as for everyday shoe.  I would highly recommend these shoes, I rarely take mine off.
B00QFJUEYW|4|Perfect!!
B00817NDI0|3|socks are adorable, but poor quality.  One pair came out of the package with a small hole in the top of the sock.
B00AJQ12W0|5|Great look! I love it
B003K172JS|1|Poor quality... Bought this wallet yrs back at the actual PGA Store in the Detroit Airport and loved that wallet. This one is nowhere near the quality of my 1st. I Don't recommend this wallet.
B00N9V6312|1|Beautiful Dress, but this dress is no XXL by a long shot. More like U.S. size 4. Very disappointed. Plus, no size tags on the dress!
B00AV591D6|5|I received my babydoll today and was so excited to try it on.  I was hesitant with ordering in a &#34;One-size-fits-all&#34; format, as I'm 5'2&#34; and my measurements are 49-48-52 but I was pleasantly surprised with the comfortable fit of Queen size.<br />The material is great. Although I order the black with pink accents, they aren't pink.  They are very definitely red.  It is stretchy all over, including the hemline, which others have reviewed as tight.  It doesn't cling in any of the wrong places as I was worried about when taking it out of the package. It drapes nicely. It's sheer, but not in a trashy way.  It's very romantic and sweet looking.  Overall, I'm going to shop this brand again, and my husband, whom hasn't seen me in lingerie since our first baby nearly 9 years ago, is gonna enjoy THIS Valentines day! ❤️
B004K1EFGK|5|Ok, so I know I'm writing a review on a dress that I never did actually wear.  I tried it on when I received it and it is beautiful! I bought it to wear for a maternity shoot that I ended up just going casual for.  So, if anyone is looking for this dress, which I see is out of stock.  I have one availble for purchase!  It still has the tags on it.  I bought it at the 50% off price of $80.00 Willing to negotiate price even. Thanks!
B00H9AQALC|4|Good product
B00M3Y2TTG|5|Really cute jacket.  A little bigger than I thought it would be, but that means he can still wear it.
B002PU9X3S|4|I am 5'6\\" and wear a size 7/8 with a 36C bra size. I ordered the medium and am very pleased with the fit. The sleeves are too big around the wrists--as many buyers have mentioned--but can easily be fixed with a pin or two. Most buyers mentioned that the belt was huge, but mine seems to fit just right. The shorts are definitely see-through and short, but are adorable. Overall a very cute outfit if you have the desire to be a DCC! Paired with the DCC White Boot Tops (which I also bought), this costume is great! Thanks! :)
B0046MTXRY|4|I love this outfit! It is SO cute! The leopard gloves are a great touch. I wear<br />my real corset, instead of the flimsy thing they ship with it.... All the leopard stuff<br />is great quality - just the cincher is cheapy.... Sad that it *barely* fits me, though<br /><br />I am a size 14. I think it would probably fit a size 8-12.... The bottoms are a bit<br />tight...
B003CVFBJ4|5|Both my baby boys have been wearing these and they are very durably made! Just love it! Thanks for a quality product!
B00KNXFN0G|3|Ordered a small fits like an xs
B003Z6Q4LA|2|This belt is in the 8-20 boys section, then listed as \\"20\\" so I assumed it was a length appropriate for boys who wear size 20 pants.  In fact, this belt is only 20 inches long, and belongs in the toddler section.  The belt is a nice quality, and if you want a 20\\" belt, it's fine.
B0046ZRS3C|1|I've discovered that the Lamaze brand in general is very cheap, generic, product. This bra in particular though is uncomfortable and itchy. The fabric is very rough which makes it itchy, the plastic is cheaply cut so that the strap adjuster pokes and scraps at you all day. Im a 38DD and the only reason this product gets a single star is because this brand is one of the few brands that you can order your pre-MEASURED bra size and thats the size you will get, no second guessing
B00IOXLFHM|4|perfect
B00CONNDGO|5|I love it!!! This product fits exactly as it is supposed to.
B00I9E7AV6|4|Ordinarily would not spend this much on a bra. However, it is true to size and fits well.
B00AUDWKZA|2|Cute but way too small!! Order the next size up.
B008H3VS94|4|This shirt is okay for around house but it was cut too small.  The colors are great and delivery was excellent.  Next time I would watch size ordered and who I order it for.
B00GG6A16U|5|This little cap is adorable just as it is in the picture. Not small like for a NB but maybe a med.
B00MMKHPL8|5|The sox were a gift for my Grandaughter . She has to wear a uniform to school  but anything goes with her sox, so she loved them.
B001EZ7JA4|5|Brilliant ....Can't wait for Halloween
B0007YXVSM|5|I love these bras! I have big girls (size: 42DDD) and it gives great support without the uncomfortable under wire!
B00LHVH9BO|3|I thought alot  about buying this bikini set, I read all the reviews and as you can imagine it!<br />The bottom fits ok to wear a size 3.<br />The top is very small for a cup C if you're Cup C I recommend to order it a bigger size . I ordered a Large size and does not cover all but it can works.<br />Good luck.
B0007CKQKK|5|Item came as described an the fit was as expected. Item came quick and I am pleased with these pants.
B003WE90P2|4|I love this shirt! I don't really like the high neckline though. Other than that I have nothing bad to say about this shirt.
B00UT67ZLC|2|I ordered this outfit in size newborn... It would fit an 18 month old maybe even a two year old!  Disappointing.
B00E4N6VUM|5|I love this hoodie! It looks great, and it's pretty warm.
B00QWQHRQQ|5|Absolutely loved this product! Looks expensive but is not, very sexy! I can not wait to wear it this summer, bought a second one just in case it gets popular this summer and I can't find it! I'm a size 7/8 and it fit perfect, lots of stretch so I would fit a bigger size as well.
B00GP6IS3Y|2|Probably won't buy again! Too thin
B003Y7H7WA|3|This is a perfectly fine case, but it arrived completely wrapped in both tissue paper and bubble wrap, yet still for some reason had a gross sticky substance all over the metal part where it closes.  I couldn't wash it off, and even after dousing it with rubbing alcohol it still feels sticky.
B00P9150MS|4|Very well made dress and beautiful! I ordered this for my sister and it was way to small! The seller is great though and for a small extra fee were getting a custom made dress! The only down side was when we got this dress the zipper was broke I hope they take my return!
B001IV8ULQ|3|I like garys bikinis much better.. This I like the idea if a pouch so your privates feel secure ..like the look .... But not the fit. - am 170 - 5'9''. Athletic. Build
B00BK6YCRU|5|I love these socks!! I get a lot of compliments on them....so comfy! I will be buying more! Great value as well.
B00KD9OPA4|1|Hippopotamus biggg
B00QY5AEWO|5|I just received it and cannot wait to use it!!!
B006SRI5G0|5|This picture does not make the dress justice. The flowers at the bottom are individually placed, so it's not a print. It's so, so pretty.
B008LTN3N8|5|I am 5'4&#34; 102 lbs and it did not hang on me, was just snug enough. The material was not too thin, good for warmth.
B00NFG0K5Q|4|This is a very cute dress that truly exhibits all I would have expected from a Calvin Klein denim dress. The color and quality was exactly what I anticipated. The dress runs slightly small but not a lot. Excellent choice!
B00DIINZ62|4|The only pure cotton socks that fit me but I wish they came in white.
B000EGR6IY|4|Great for summer, like the drawstring for better fit, course my grandson likes them a little big for his comfort.
B007W0XRKQ|5|I'm in my 70's.  When I lost weight the booty went south.  I am 5'3&#34;, weigh 114 lbs and wear a size 6 pant that's a little loose.  The size Small was too tight.  I returned it and quickly received a credit. I then reordered 3 pair in medium.  One fit perfectly in the legs.  The other two are a little looser but acceptable. They are lightly padded but look natural under all clothing.  I like that they can be worn all day without feeling hot or unnatural.  And the pads can be removed before washing.  I don't, but if you desire more padding you could buy 2 pair and layer the pads.  Overall I am very please. Beats the heck out of altering all my pants.
B00U20K080|5|Bitchin
B00219R79K|4|The bra fitted well, comfortable and just as I wanted it to be. Firm and intact. I'll recommend it to anyone
B00GZNMI5Q|3|I am five foot even, and weight 108 pounds. I knew I would have to get them tailored length wise, because I'm so short, however after I purchased a size small I cant even squeeze into them! This is sad considering I really was looking forward to these pants. By the way be wary of camel toe!!! YUP ladies, apparently the Asian ladies across the pond don't have that problem, however here in the US..um yea i'ts pretty scary. So I'm going to return this product, but by the looks of other reviews it's going to be easier just to keep this item and chock it up as a lesson learned.  Never again.
B000IYXNAC|5|I bought this item in aqua floral for my very fashion-conscious, elegant, 87-year-old mother, and she LOVES it because it is \\"warm without being hot, the print is contemporary, it isn't frumpy, and I feel dressed\\". She doesn't like to lounge in a robe, and this is the perfect solution. Actually, I think she likes it because it's really young looking. It washes well, also. I already ordered another one for her. This one has flowers. It might be too old-lady-like for her!
B00SSNP3V2|4|feels great, alil tight
B001S0IPO4|5|God quality leather and craftsmanship.  I got the natural color because I like things to age and wear gracefully.  Given enough time, this belt will be an all around town belt that I'll wear proudly.
B008NA8O0M|5|Just got the hat yesterday, very clean, no blemishes, packaged in a USPS bag. No damage I can see. Glad I purchased, adding to my hat collection lol.
B0088WRGAE|5|Loved the suit just too big in the pant waist.  Would recomend to anyone great quality.  I would order another at some point.
B00J2MHL6I|5|Looks great. Fabric is flexible and hugs the curves.
B00IKCVZPE|5|fabric is great for my body type. fits perfectly and looks great. extremely happy with it.
B00WLJG27S|5|Love it!
B00FHN9SOO|4|Nice top and well made.
B00AMSY7VI|4|love it but its rather small on my head.
B007OWENTG|5|Love the pattern, reminds me of the old Rose patterns women wore when I was a kid, my wife has gotten a lot of complements on theses. They soften up a lot when washed
B00L216HLC|1|The dress was too small it fit like a shirt not a dress also it fits too tight
B00EZYKW4Q|5|The dress is adorable and looked great!!  Perfect for the Christmas Concert
B00I4C8P44|5|my lil girl loves her &#34;peyton shirt&#34; Go broncos!!!!
B00L66KU1G|5|Softest underwear ever. I love them.
B00FZVHKQ6|5|I bought this to be an undershirt for tops with necklines that need some help in the coverage department. Seems to be one of the only sleeveless mock necks in Rayon as apposed to other more synthetic feeling materials that I normally avoid. I'm 5'6&#34; and bought a small as I wanted it fitted. The fabric but not see through in gray but very see through in the off white. Long enough. Stretches a lot (even to accommodate maternity). Washes well and does not seem to shrink. True to color pictured. Would recommend to anyone looking for a really soft, comfy, washable, packable staple but not for someone expecting to wear as stand alone piece. Will probably be back for more. Only wish they had black.
B00JJ75OD8|5|Comfortable and well made.
B00SAG36GQ|1|Too small I had to return it and replaced it with the Spanx In Power Line.
B008S20IF4|5|Thicker than most handkerchiefs; for those of us who still carry them! Wash well and don't seem to come out as wrinkled as my old ones.
B00TFCNTNO|3|I needed something to work with broken arm. Not so much a fashion statement as a practical choice.  I just laundered this top, major shrinkage!
B0018OKR32|3|The problem wasn't in the waist or legs, they have ample room,  but in the backside.  It seems these Levi's were made for someone that was in a terrible accident and had their buttocks completed cut off.  I own several pairs of this style of Levi's jeans and all but this pair fit perfectly, but these are very tight at the top of the rear.  If I wasn't an old man and most of my rear end hadn't already disapeared, I would not be able to zip them.
B002PEP5GI|1|didn,t last 30 mins I paid for four of them, not one isn,t broken I wouldn,t  buy this product.......I hope to get my money back
B007FZHHAE|3|It's okay. Definitely looks like a costume more than a dress
B000MX97HM|1|Very disappointed with the fit, fabric, and overall quality of this panties.  It tends to ride up in the back and the material is so thin it will not last long. The lace elastic on the upper part of the underwear folds back instead of holding your stomach in. Very disappointed!!
B00NJXI70U|4|Its a littlle small for me but its ok
B004T8YW6W|1|The picture shown is not the correct shirt for the description. MM sells two shirts, one called the Sleeveless Pull Over Nursing Tank and one called the Sleeveless Pullover Double Opening Nursing Tank. Be careful! Otherwise, shirt was received in a timely manner, if only it was what I thought I had ordered.
B00QV2AUFG|5|Good quality
B00NM7Q06Q|5|Exactly as pictured. Nice scarf.
B00CYP10CG|5|I recieved my costume before I thought I would n it fit perfect totally pleased
B00IU14L1U|5|Nice yoga pants for the price.  The material is somewhat thin, so if you are looking for a heavier pant, this might not be the one for you.  I have washed them several times, and they are holding up well.  I like the thinner material for wearing outside.  I would recommend this pants to others!
B007AGZ1XS|5|These PJ's are so light and comfortable.  Great for summer.  They are very thin and I would wear a light robe around others than family.  I am 5&#34;3' and did not have to hem the pants which pleases me greatly.  But taller ladies may not like.
B005LW01EM|5|wonderful watch. it looks more attractive than in photos.
B00EB1O9D8|5|These pants fit well and are very comfortable.  The color is listed as &#34;Lindsay&#34; but mine were just your standard black jean color.
B00AEE7DIO|5|When I first saw them in the package I thought 'Uh-oh, they look really big and long.' But they're great - scrunched down they look just like cheerleader socks, and pulled up they look like the knee-hi's I used to wear many years ago. They have just the right amount elasticity and have a reinforced toe.
B00E3I93KS|5|these work perfect for my daughter who has AFO braces.
B00MG3CY1W|5|Great buy!
B0097HL5FQ|5|Very cute hat, looks great and fits great<br />My 7 year old daughter and I share it and it looks cute and age appropriate on both of us<br />I was a little disappointed in how it was package and shipped because the bill was bent bad off to the side I had to set it and let it sit several days to get it shaped
B00O3WMGPS|5|Comfortable fabric, very good fit  and long lasting and easy to care for.  I particularly appreciate the  good  rear coverage and the feeling of freedom and lack of binding  that the French cuts offer.  Anyone  seeking these qualities should be ordering Jockey.  Of course, the great colors and fun designs don't hurt at all.
B0082BL4GS|5|I was looking all over for a great dress to wear on my honeymoon that was lightweight, attractive and fashionable. This dress line was the answer! I ordered this maxi dress in Pink with the ruffle straps (so cute) and after it arrived I ordered two more in different styles and colors! I wore them the whole time on my vacation. Over my bikini with some flip flops for daytime and was able to dress it up easily for dinner! Perfect for vacation or the beach! I was nervous about ordering online and it not fitting but this material looks good on and has a little \\"give.\\" Totally worth the money! The fabric is amazing and I love the hot pink color of this one! Best part is they are made in the USA!
B007PESS5I|5|Good
B00E4H8KH0|4|I have the robe & was hoping to find the bottoms to match; the bottoms are much lighter in color than the robe, but they still look cute together.  Soft & comfy.
B00B5D1ODI|4|Material is very soft and color looks the same as in the picture. It is perfect except the length. good.
B001GAMKDS|5|Great shirt. I just wish they'd put the design on a woman's tee
B006W9BTBC|5|Bought this hat for my husband.  HE LOVES IT. Highest quality and looks fabulous.  He wears an extra large and the extra large here fit him fine.
B00IBHNR72|5|Great socks, and such lovely colors. Wearable art.
B00475DIZI|1|it only comes out 5'' if that. not a tutu for ballet. maybe for a slutty ballerina but not a real one. not one to make like a pancake either
B007MW5AX6|5|I waited till I wore this shirt a few times before rating it. the sleeves and the bottom of this shirt did not shrink after washing it, which was important to me. I really like how it fits, it is very comfortable, and of course it is made by Union workers in  America which is great!
B00GN6VUOK|1|Was made of cheap fabric, happy i bought a different one at the same time because i would be truly unhappy if i wanted this was just a backup plan. I am truly unhappy with this.
B00OTVROHS|4|Sizes run a little large - I wear 34 jeans (granted with a belt on) and had to return these for a size 32 instead. Be warned that the drawstrings only are in front and really don't tighten up the waist that much.<br /><br />That being said, these are some very nice swim shorts. Aside from the waist, their pretty tight in other areas, but they still feel comfortable.
B00CB2OMSG|5|great
B00CV23DHM|5|This is a great little hat for this price.  Perfect for the Admiral in your life! Easy to adjust size.
B00K5NP81S|1|did'nt fit and looked ugly on me tried to send back a month ago still nothing lost 16$
B001PO5J9W|5|This mask is well made - definitely worth the money!<br />Great colors too, everyone was sure that I was Wolverine with the mask on.<br />I agree with the other reviewers. The latex mold leaves a halo around the eyes that can become uncomfortable. Some customization with a razor or scissors can make the mask feel better around the eyes.<br />If you are not skilled with sharp instruments, or are a younger fan, get someone with more skills or an adult to help you with this. You don't want to wreck your awesome mask!
B005LAFUH2|1|I ordered this in medieval blue, sz. S for a gift. It came with blue, red and green plaid flannel pants that look nothing like the picture. It should have been blue pants with dots on them instead of thin, cheaply made plaid pants.   The shirt in the picture looks like it is fitted to the body but in reality, it was loose and oddly large at the bottom/waist area. The pants and shirt are more like a size Med/Large instead of a S, even though it says S on the label. Not a good buy and I'm very dissatisfied.   I'm disgusted that I paid $45.00 for these pajamas. I could have bought a better pair for $10.00.
B00CXMYIQU|3|Kind of tight around the thighs
B0030GZYAM|3|Overall the undies look to be of pretty decent quality (I would never spend $65 on the real ones, so I don't have much to compare them to).  The beads are attached with a clasp at both ends so they can be fully removed for washing.  Unfortunately, these one size fits all are a little snug on me (I'm a size 14/16 or size 8 underwear)  I thought it would be a stretch, but thought I would give it a try.  They are however very stretchy and I would imagine them fitting up to a small size 12 very well.
B005P4CW8Y|5|un excelente tejido. muy buen color. material durable. esta marca siempre cumple con las expectativas. altamente recomendado. excelente relación costo-beneficio.
B00J2UM54S|5|My little boy Lopes like a real groom
B002IYHEOQ|5|It fits my wife just fine. It does what it is supposed to do. There is nothing not to like.
B00UMGY93Q|5|Nice one ....
B004CCWMF8|5|My expectations were met and more!!! I have to say, the hand written thank you card was the first sign that this order was going to be a wonderful.    The robe is beautiful, soft and my husband loves it.    I have a hard time finding robes with long enough sleeves, this one was perfect.    I would highly recommend it.
B005JTDCAW|5|I liked this product very much. Graphics are great. Fabric is soft and light. Very comfortable. It is worth the price.
B00CZ6NO1Y|1|pedi this model  Levi's Juniors 535 Legging Jean, White,31/13 Medium  and ordered another. I am not satisfied
B00WQYZYT0|1|disappointed
B00B5QC22M|5|Very good quality of the lining.<br /><br />Fitness of this writing I'm older.<br /><br />한국어<br /><br />영어<br /><br />일본어<br /><br />Very good quality of the lining.
B00AN67GBC|4|It's a well made wallet but the clip that holds the chain to the wallet is a pain to take on and off. The eyelet on the wallet isn't close enough to the edge. If you're never going to take the chain off then don't worry about it.
B003IYYEDE|5|It is a smart concept and the top fits nicely. I'm US top size 6-8 and S is good. The bra clips are a bit fiddly but yes- so much 'lighter' to only have one straps vs bra AND tank top!
B009NTELZO|3|Hoped this would be bit enough, but the pattern stretched so badly that they looked ridiculous instead of festive. Wear size 10 shoes, so I knew I was gonna be stretching it and that's why they weren't returned.
B00OWV3PW8|5|Good looking, nice quality.  Holds a lot too!
B002EPR0AW|5|My girlfriend had been looking all over for a shower wrap, was a great gift she loves it. If you are looking for a towel wrap I would recommend this wrap.
B008BT5OLC|5|We just had my son baptized at just 5 weeks old last weekend and I purchased these booties to match his heirloom outfit.<br /><br />I could not have been happier with these booties! I ordered the pearl and the ribbon was just the right off-white color to match his vintage baptism outfit. The quality of the stitches are wonderful--and I say this as a crochet hobbyist myself. The ribbons come undone and re-tie which made it really easy to tighten them a tad so that they did not fall of the tiny baby feet.<br /><br />I think they're the most beautiful things I've ever ordered off of Amazon and I will keep them in his baby memento box from now on. I was surprised at the few reviews here that said these didn't fit their older, bigger babies. It was obvious to me when I was ordering them that these are meant for newborns, and they fit my average (8 lbs) 5 week old's feet just perfectly. If you have any other questions that I didn't answer, feel free to leave a comment and I'll do my best to reply.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these! They make a sweet gift or addition to any baptism/christening outfit. They looked beautiful in pictures, they came nicely packaged, and they were just what I wanted.
B00EECKMDU|5|Love these exactly what I expected I would definitely order a size larger then you wear because of the restrictive sides but damn these look good
B004ZKT3I6|5|Great quality, arrived before expected!!!
B009EEW29K|5|I ordered this for my son (after Christmas).  I purchased one for my son through a local store before Christmas.  He loved it, but it was too small.  The store did not have any XL in stock.  I was able to locate the size I needed on Amazon.  My son was very pleased.
B001OA7MA6|5|This is a very cute head piece. I bought the red for my daughter and she wore it during Christmas. The one thing I did was trim it back a bit to keep it out of her eyes.
B00HV6GMH6|4|Another good product of IZOD.  Fits as expected and material is very soft.  Can last very long.
B00L43S34C|2|I ordered a medium and the skirt was way too big for me I had to fold the wait in will take it to get it altered.
B00C9WNHG6|2|Not size. .<br />Some small. .
B00MIJSV98|5|Great looking sweater.  Good price.  Great fit.  Recommend it highly!
B00GUGUVGQ|5|My fiance wears this as much as humanly possible.  It looks great!
B00IKD53AQ|3|I'm really tall. It would be great if they had tall sizes as they were quite comfortable, but way to short.
B0018OOYMW|1|Levis....what has happened?? In just a few months these Jeans are ripped out in the crotch.  Usually it takes years for Levis to fall apart.  I would also like to mention = what is with sewing the pocket so your index finger gets stuck in the seem on the way down???  The first thing I do is cut the 1/2 inch of thread off the pocket where you decided to sew up the side of the  pocket instead of stopping at the corner.  This way my finger doesn't get stuck in the pocket on the way down.  Quality has really dropped and I've been a lifelong 501 Levis buyer and the last 3 or 4 years of Levis are just getting worse and worse.
B00SGFW0MC|5|This hat is adorable, very chic and easy to wear.  It's well-made and a good quality straw hat.  I hate baseball caps and those visor things that so many older women wear.  This hat will perk you up - the red and blue colors are very cheerful and great for spring and summer.  Have fun wearing it!
B002MPQHGM|4|great hat, alittle big
B009NMINDC|3|Tirned out to be a little large in the upper body, which is odd as a 36DD. I'm keeping it though as it does mostly what I want it to.
B00ULNOZUC|5|These are a LITTLE pricey, but I got them for my niece as part of her b-day gift. She wore em to a concert I took her too and they looked adorable on, making me not care about the price at all. They're smaller than they look, which is a good thing to me making them less costumey, and more casual so she can wear em whenever she wants!
B00DW4NC10|5|All I can say is... I got so many compliments when I rocked this one!!! It is very thin, like a burn out shirt..I like the white, its perfect for summer.. Very different and bold... Feminism at its best!
B00BOSBAHO|5|Jacket was purchased for my Fiance and it was perfect. The fit was really nice, not at all baggy or sloppy.
B00BTR15ES|1|I regret I bought this.  The material looks fine.  But the waist-to-crotch length is so tight that it is honestly a pain to wear.  Meanwhile, the waist size is a bit larger than I would expect.
B00DRYHL76|5|She will love it!
B00512QRNG|5|nice... fits well
B00OM5W9R6|5|Great quality for price
B00P0DPYNA|4|I love the feel and the look but it's to small. I ordered a xl but I gues it runs small so looks like I'll be reordering
B00II814Z6|5|Very cute!  I wish there were more than 3 in a box.
B0012QM8IS|3|This is not a bra I would recommend for anyone that needs to wear their bra all day.  The comfort is good for about 8 hours but after that its distracting.  I am a solid 34-C and the Medium size that is recommended is too big, even on the smallest clasp.  The material is soft enough but I felt as though I was wearing a nursing bra...I definetly did not feel attractive in it.      I received this as part of a promotion to sample the product via bzzagent.
B00BM8IT66|5|I was expecting it to be one of those cheap shirts that just has lettering plastered on it, but it's actually a really nice fabric, and it fits perfectly. I am a chesty female and it's really great because it's perfect around the middle and long.
B00JMHOAF8|5|I love these and will always wear them if they are available - instead of a bra. Much more comfortable.
B005H3IX7M|3|It's nice & the leather has a good feel to it. I bought it to make it easier to get to coins/change which I use a lot.  It's too small to  Identify & reach the coins in a timely manner.
B003BSMM1I|1|If you have a child that has narrow hips, and thin appendages, don't try Champion (or Russell) sweats. Way too bulky for the thin kids, and if they also happen to be a bit on the short-side, these definitely don't work out. (Rusells on the other-hand run Short, but also way too roomy in the waist/rear)
B00ID3YTVM|5|I bought this for my 5 yr old grandson to wear in my daughter's wedding.  He didn't need the suspenders but bought the set because it was the right color, the right price and the shipping time was ideal.  He looked fantastic in her October wedding and loves the suspenders just to wear for fun.
B00GWMZ1IQ|1|These arrived as Black Gloves and not as shown in Grey!!! It was very disappointing and a hassles now to find actual Grey gloves if available.
B008UDGAYY|4|These socks felt a little tight when before being washed a couple of times. It is a little awkward to line up all of the grey patches with the bottom of the foot and these socks don't feel right if they are not being worn exactly proper.
B0047RHHOO|5|A perfect gift.  I loved it and the ones given as gifts were loved by recipients.  Would definitely recommend this product.
B00A8EFN0U|5|Bery
B005HDYS58|3|Pretty but has a chemical smell.
B005EWGOM2|2|i didnt love this item. it was not the correct size even if they sent the size i asked. did not like the way it fits on my chest area and will give it away as soon as i find someone who fits its size
B00H9VS1LS|5|she looks great in it. she says it fits great and is very comfortable. she said she would recommend this dress
B007I7QNS6|5|The shirt is of good quality. It's soft and comfortable for baby.  It just runs a bit small  my son is 12 months, I ordered the 12-18 months and it fit just right. Another pound or two and it would've been too tight.
B00OKYSRC0|4|Good quality T-shirt
B0079MIJRI|1|just a warning to beware buying this product...my daughter who is not allergic to anything else wore this leotard but she got a very red, itchy rash on her thighs in the area of the elastic band around the thigh...it is a very cute leotard but we cannot use it now unless i try to put some sort of backing on the lining...i believe it is due to the spandex which is used in the elastic band around the thigh...after reading something on the internet, it may be due to certain chemicals they use in making the spandex...anyway, i would not recommend this leotard.
B00WJADEN4|5|this is my second review for an Anni Coco dress and I'm going to keep it simple just like the last one: size: I am 5.3 and ordered a size small. fits perfectly snug and the ribbon makes it even better in case you need more room. material: stretchy. I quickly ran my steamer over it and it looks good as new! I love how snug it fits on my waist and has a nice enough poof to wear with or without a petticoat. quality: thick, well sewn and looks amazing for its price! I love this line now and wish they had more 50s style dresses!
B00E97951A|3|Very warm, looks classy. Fits s***ty in the shoulders/armpit area (and I'm not a body builder)
B00D23KCLE|4|Received it in a decent timely manner, and merchandise was as expected
B00J3NAJT2|4|Beautiful shirt. Ordered the cream one as well in the same size, but the black lace fit was much smaller.
B00J1LW5ZC|5|If you're constantly struggling to find hats large enough to fit your head, this Maleficent headdress will fit perfectly.  I can't imagine this would fit most children without a load of adjustments. I recommend getting it out of the package as soon as possible to prevent the horns from getting distorted and bent, and plan on using a wig cap underneath.  Speaking of underneath- since this is all rubber, it gets hot and sweaty under the headdress.  This is definitely not something you could put on for half the night and then take off later, unless you don't mind everyone seeing your wet gross hair plastered to your head.
B007OX0NGC|5|Nice flannel robe!  Not thick and very soft after washing.
B0018OKZ0W|5|Shrink-to-fits can be the best jeans you'll ever own. You just have to put in the work to get them there. Once you do, they fit like a dream, are tough, look great, and last forever.<br /><br />What we do: First, take a long HOT soak in a bath while wearing the jeans (prepare to have your legs turn blue for a day or two). Dry off as best as you can and wear the jeans for the rest of the day (until dry and then some). After you put them in the washer for the next 2-3 times, take them out immediately and put them on. Wear until dry. Then you can start washing and drying as normal.
B00H3ZFQIG|4|My son adores Hot Wheels and this was a big hit with him. Hard to find Hot Wheels clothing in stores. Material could stand to be softer personally and it ran a tad large on him, but wearable.
B0038Q5R2Y|5|I am a referee and I purchased these to hold my shirt in my slacks, It works great. Very durable.
B000E0V2TY|5|This was a great deal and am very pleased with them. Wish I had got more of them for the price.
B007OQ95WM|4|These fit just as expected and the color/back pockets are great. The price is well worth it. I will def. buy more!
B00COYNA6Q|3|Cute but somewhat small - I'd return it but don't have time.  Quality as expected - it is okay.  oh it's a lot brighter neon than I expected.
B002K6F79G|4|I wanted a bra to sleep in at night, while pregnant.  I was a 32C pre-pregnancy and am now a 36C at 20 weeks.  It's super comfy.  The only drawback, which I knew when purchasing it, was that you have to put it over your head (sports-bra style) instead of hooks.  I got the black one in medium and large.  I am returning the medium and getting an xl because I know I'll grow towards the end of my pregnancy and post-pregnancy.  The large works perfectly right now.
B006PGGJOE|4|I bought this to replace an old leather wallet. I like that it has made me reduce my wallet load immensely, no more back pain.<br />It holds what I need, license, 4 credit cards, and very little cash.<br />If you are a cash kind of guy this wallet is not for you.<br />Had a problem with the accordion card holder that split.<br />Sharkk took care of it and shipped me out a new wallet within days.<br />Best customer service ever….I'm talking Nordstrom's style customer service.
B00D41Z750|3|These shoes will be fine for the airport.  Easy to get on and off.  But I would not wear them for a long walk.  Nice that they didn't bother my bunion.
B00JQDZ7YQ|5|fit my nephew as expected. Loved it
B004FQUD3E|5|Beautiful! Brilliant colors. Sturdy stitching . I would buy this again. Great value, great quality.
B00KD6PDD0|5|Cute! Fun! Great!
B00CE91HES|5|Fits well, a little on the thin side. Love the zip up hood, that turns into a mask.  Bright colors.
B004Q0RI2I|5|gave it as a gift for my brother but the size was somewhat big so next time i will get it one size smaller.
B0039824WM|4|Very cute.
B002DEWB3A|5|This arrived extremely quickly, and is FANTASTIC. It is comfortable, sexy, and surprisingly I found it can be worn in more than one way! Definitely worth owning!
B006SRT0VO|4|Really hard to go with out fly
B00DU1QCVC|5|Eye-catching design. Fun math humor. Great for math teachers.  I was pleased to find a seller who carries a poly-cotton blend as blends tend to shrink less and keep their color longer.
B000066R34|1|Yucky fabric, boxy fit, sleeves too short, and I swear I've done a better job of sewing back in my jr. high home ec class.
B002I9RMB6|3|That being said, my 3 year old little girl really enjoys this night gown.  She calls it her &#34;strawberry&#34; nightgown.  It's 100% polyester, but it doesn't seem to chafe her sensitive skin.  Easy to clean.  Looks great on!
B00W8096VY|5|Good undies.
B008HYF1DM|2|I returned it.  It is way too tight, and not quite deep enough.  Cute if you are child-size, I suppose.
B00TUCE91A|5|Lovely.
B000W3OF3I|5|It looks much more expensive that what it cost. Size was exactly as described, it is a furry belt, but very short. It's just what I was looking for but was unable to find in the stores.
B005DSI1B4|5|The onesie is just as pictured. The logo is great too.
B00MYBERKC|5|Just what I wanted.  It covers the arms and shoulders but doesn't hang to cover the top or dress (except in the back).  Light silky material is perfect for summer either as an arm cover-up or if it's just a little chilly.<br /><br />It runs a tad small but fabric has a lot of give so it's fine.  I got the white in small which I will definitely keep.  If I decide to get another in black, I will probably opt for the medium.  (I typically wear a size 4).
B00D3G20X8|4|I've become more of a fan of H2H in that even though their items are inexpensive, they are not cheap. This was a good fit, a little long, but I have just tucked the bottom up underneath if I need to.
B003SO5QZY|5|Very pleased with the quality...thanks
B00A7CT82C|5|Excellent fabric, great fit, great look, excellent bang for your buck!
B0073VRYQW|2|First the good.  There are lots of pockets.  It fit well and looked good even though I am a big guy.<br /><br />Now the not so good.  The main zipper failed 3 out of 6 times I tried it.  The Scottevest customer service tried to tell me I was zipping it wrong.  It is just not a heavy duty zipper for a $100+ piece of clothing and it failed.  The customer service was not nice.  Do not believe their &#34;You will be satisfied. Guaranteed.&#34;  It is not true.  If everything is not perfect make sure you are prepared to pay the shipping back because they won't.  I wish it had a heavier duty zipper.
B002LFNIS8|5|Excellent!
B00JLDWHF8|5|Everyone loved the outfit.. Used this for a &#34;Disco themed Auction&#34;.. I did however wear sport top. The area around the boobs, it doesn't cover much. I am also 5'7 and wore tall heels.. Be aware you will need to purchase platforms
B00VKR4E90|4|I own this swimsuit in a black floral design (I don't think the pattern is still being sold by the Esther Williams brand) But plan to order the navy/yellow polkadot version for an upcoming vacation. This suit is EXTREMELY flattering (on everyone I've seen it on also I might add). However-I own this suit in a size 6 (I am a size 6/medium in clothes, relatively curvy but athletic build), it's a bit snug in the thigh and bust and little troublesome to pull on. Size up. Second, be aware these suits are ONLY lined in the front part (The bust, front torso and nether region) the back is NOT lined (i'd probably only be concerned about this with the light colored suits, as my black suit is not see through in any capacity). It's a tad pricey for a bathing suit, but these suits are well made, I have not experienced any fading with proper wash and care, and I'm a swimmer.  In addition to the halter top, it has a sewn in front bra with soft cups(no pad inserts), and boning on the sides of the bust. (it's enough support for an ample bust-I'm a 36 C)
B00DS6YHMA|5|This coat is constructed with the finest materials and the stitching is immaculate. Glad I purchased this coat, just angry I didn't do it sooner.
B004PBRGUC|5|These clips are adorable. They are the perfect size for my 2 month old daughter and the variety of colors makes matching a breeze.
B000AIA7W8|5|This is just what I was looking for.<br />Love the color choices as well.
B00CIBCJ8K|3|Snags easy, but light weight and pretty.
B007C2PYKA|4|Let me start by saying I know that Gerber brand clothes run small.  My baby wears 9 month clothes in most brands, so I bought size 12 month in Gerber and they fit perfectly.  I bought these shirts with the intention of embellishing them with embroidered designs.  These shirts held up well in the machine and have held the embroidery well even after several washes.  I would definitely buy these shirts for this purpose again
B009X98AVK|4|Loved the dress. It was a little larger than I thought it would be. I'm 5'9 with thicker thighs, the dress still hit mid thigh.  Only problem was tryin to track dress. I called the company, the shipping company no one could find it or tell me when it would arrive. But came before expected date, so I would order from them again
B00GICLT2C|4|So as I've read all of the other reviews prior to ordering this and got one size larger. Usually I am a Medium, but because it runs short on most people I got a size Large. I am 5'3&#34; and 120 lbs. I think I expected it to be large in the middle area, but the arms and legs fit almost exactly. If I were to get a Medium, the arms and legs would be alittle too short. The tail is like soooo low that it almost touches the ground. I'm going to see if I get any weird comments about the tail, and I'll just get it tailored higher. When you first get it, you should WASH IT. It leaves this storage dusty smell so make sure you wash it. Other than that, the quality is as expected. I just got my package today which is a month earlier than expected so I'm extremely happy about that.
B00PEYDQAI|5|Love it.
B00JQE120I|5|Great price - adorable!
B00ARBGPZG|5|I really am happy with the fit on these trunks. I like that they're low ans the legs are short, but not so much so that they're overly risque for everyday wear!<br /><br />Worth the price, though I wouldn't complain if they were cheaper!
B00CBQ4VV0|4|Everything about this jacket is great but the color isn't really charcoal, it's got a reddish or brownish hue to it.
B00HEYVD6K|2|Soft material but just not nearly made as well as Adidas (or obviously Underarmour). There's tons of excess threads which appear to be ready to come undone. The overall cut and design is not nearly as good as my Adidas ones. Under armour seems to make the best briefs but even Adidas make ls substantially better ones for the same exact price. While the material is nice, these just feel very shoddily made.
B00FRFFQJS|5|The gift was for our grandaughter and the kids say that they love it.
B00EDIMMEW|3|Scarf is thin, but nice.  The ear warmer is such a tight fit, that I don't like to use it because it's so uncomfortable.
B005OA9XPY|4|Nice quality and true to size.  I like that the waist is slightly tapered without  ties in the back (I don't care for back ties!).
B007E59EIS|5|love them
B004YJS25I|5|Perfecta!!! Preciosa corbata😎
B002RCWBZG|1|i got one for halloween - it's a cheap plastic toy quality - and looks totally fake and  - well, like a cheap plastic toy pipe. worth about 69 cents, if that. Don't waste your money!
B000QIUF38|5|In previous years my son constantly had holes in his uniform pants from recess (he plays pretty hard). So far it is mid April, the school year is almost over, and he does not have a single hole in any of his Dickies brand pants. We are sticking with these for future school years.
B00LBW8V70|5|I like it))
B00NTYHJWG|5|Excelente producto
B00BHP0P5W|4|I just received this dress today to wear for New Year's Eve party. I am 128 lb. 5'6&#34;. I really like how it looks on. It's a little short so I will have to be careful! I'm normally a size 4-6. I got the 8(M). Definitely glad I went with that size. Any smaller would have been too tight so I suggest going up a size from your norm. We will see how it goes tonight after wearing it. Oh and there aren't straps so I guess either a strapless bra or a black strap bra would probably look fine under the lace.
B00A9ZUW7C|2|The shirt is very pretty, looks great in pic, not so great on a live person.  The first time I wore it a string snagged and pulled one side completely.  Still wearable but.....  I'm having it dry cleaned. Hopefully that will help.
B00KKCNVSQ|5|Very nice. Much nicer than picture showed. Picture didn't do it justice.
B00BG9JWEE|5|I'm 5'3 and 110 lbs. the leg warmer fits perfectly, though I'd love it to be a little bit more loose. It does do its job to gimme extra warmth. The pattern looks nice and goes well with anything.
B00F1EKGH2|4|I have these same jeans in a light denim and dark brown color. This pair in particular (dark denim with black native design), does not have much stretch. I find them to be a little tighter around the waist then the other pairs I have as well! I will buy again next time, but maybe one size larger. On the plus side of the tightness - they make your butt look good :)
B0085J3LFY|5|Everything good. I had no problems.
B00JJGB1LS|5|Looks well
B004I5VMG4|4|My hubby is pretty picky on how his clothing fits and feels.  He says the number is the same, but the material feels different.  He likes them, just not sure he LOVES them yet.
B003VEJPZ8|1|Size does not fit. I normally wear a 14 and this 16 was too small. Plan to return all three.
B00BRBT0MK|5|6 yr old son had Star wars birthday party and wore this.  He wants to wear it every day!
B009S0S5RS|5|Love them!!!
B00EPDM2WW|5|Such a great little Vest/Pant Suit, my 5 year old still wears it and it will soon be passed down to his younger brother. The shirt and vest are made of great materials. Would buy again, especially for the price!
B00KNREZP6|2|I ordered the 2x, which is my size and the shirt fit perfectly in the shoulders, chest, and waist, but the sleeve length extended over my hands and past my fingers. When I pulled the sleeves back up to my wrist and then lowered my arms, the sleeve would slide right past my fingers again. I returned it for refund.
B00L1L7Z6E|5|Absolutely love these jeans.  Inexpensive, comfortable, and great quality.  Wallflower is my favorite jeans to buy
B00FRGQ73Q|5|Perfecto 👍
B00775MMQ6|5|I have to say, I was a little bit hesitant on purchasing something sexy online. However, after getting healthy and losing 51 pounds so far, I needed something to fit the &#34;new me&#34; that isn't frilly and all clad with lace, and this looked perfect, however I was still a little worried. It arrived today, and I really wanted to try it on, but I was scared. Finally opening it i went upstairs and BOOM..it fit wonderfully. It does run just a tad large, but nothing one can't overcome to make it skin tight and sleek. I know hubby's eyes are gonna pop out when he catches me in this little number. I know mine did!!
B00C85CA1M|4|One size fits all works fine for me.
B00D379KEO|1|cheap material and a cheap iron on to the hat itself. Not worth the money, don't waste your time on it
B00FY7VEQI|5|I like the color very spring and match my shoes... very comfortable for work and true to size.  Thank you!
B009WS5S26|4|Very nice looking.  Arrived on time.  Was bought as a gift for a 21 year old  female she said she really liked it.
B00DUH35CU|5|Better fit than the Large VS V-Strings I've had for years.
B00DUXEFWS|5|I originally purchased this to wear as a long top (to cover the rear/hips), but it is super cute and versatile enough to wear as a dress, too.  I ordered the large and would've been better off with the medium or even the small, but it is too inexpensive to return.  It is super stretchy.  I wear a 6/8 (but thought the top might run small).  I wish it came in dozens of colors.  Haven't washed/dried it yet, I hope it holds up because the fabric is thin.  Love it!! It shipped fast, too.
B002R0F82G|5|Nice quality for the price. My 2 year old loves it and wants to wear it every where.
B00IK9MBUK|5|Good
B00NA0BPEM|2|Way too short
B00IAZRNDO|3|These are great looking pants, but in my opinion the waist was a little bigger than 32 and the calves were pretty tight. I bike a lot and these won't be my favorite pants to bike in because the material, while soft, isn't very flexible.
B00368CK3I|4|I purchased the denium and tan. The denium stretches and the tan come out of the wash without needing ironing.<br />The both ran a little big.
B00KR4XHS6|4|Great buy!
B00A17K3YK|4|Great product.
B007U1PJPS|5|I loved this outfit. It's was very soft and true to size! I would defenitally order again from this company .
B002PDPEGU|5|I wear a size 34DDD (who knew!), and my breasts are wide-set and shallow.  I have this bra in two colors and I'm coming back for another.  I've never had any luck finding bras that fit comfortably until I found this one.  This feels like angels are reaching down and hugging me.  Your mileage may vary, but if your breasts are far apart and not extremely &#34;full&#34; this bra may be just the ticket.
B004C98CPA|4|I ordered this robe for my 11 year old granddaughter as a birthday present.  The XL fits her now, but she will probably outgrow it within a year.  The quality of the material is very nice (not as lush as a high-end adult spa robe) but I think it is a good value for the price.  I wish it came in an XXL as I would order it again when she has a growth spurt.
B00OHZES3O|5|Love them so comfy my sister loves them to do I guess I will be buying a few more❤️❤️❤️❤️
B0069SKVPG|5|This was purchased as a white elephant gift for a Christmas party, and it was, without question, the hit of the evening.  The silk-screening is surprisingly good and the end result is pretty hilarious.  The material is pretty thick and robust.  Very warm, but most of all the novelty is just a gas. Highly recommended.
B004PEI4X2|5|These skirts fit perfectly. They are for two girls who wear 3T and 4T pants. They are not tight, however, they don't fall down during dance.
B0014H5A2G|5|Fit great.... has a drawstring to adjust....  not &#34;cheap&#34; as I read here.... with enough room to wear over a athletic protectors....  great for softball
B003DTLU9U|4|I would definitely recommend this product.  It is of the highest quality and has many nice features.  I normally take an extra large, which is what I ordered.  It fits a bit big, but not so much so that I should have order a large.  So I wouldn't recommend ordering down a size.  Just know that it will be a bit roomier than you might normally expect.
B004304YE6|5|I love the ears since headbands always bothered md and the tail is great as well. I am very pleased with what I got and when I got it. Shipping was fast!
B00LNCKLF8|5|A life saver!!!!
B00GMRA6RM|5|Love it! works just as I intended. This belt made a great gift for Christmas. These are better than regular belts.
B00FPH4L3U|3|I just bought these to have an extra pair around... they're definitely not my style and I can't wear them over top my current glasses because you can see right through them but they're fun.
B00B17P5YW|5|Really nice!
B0002TOWCG|5|I've been buying these for ten years. They are great.
B00CPWBE4C|5|I was hugely annoyed when I picked up six shirts from the cleaners and found all the collar stays missing. I ordered this set, it arrived 2 days later via Prime and I was back in business. There are plenty of sizes in here to fit all shirts.
B00JM2WERY|5|We loved ,very rich colors :-) awesome for summer :-)
B00ORZIYBQ|5|I've purchased five of these wallets and I love them.  The last two have been this new version which is excellent.  I've had to get used to having such a hard rigid wallet in my pocket but it's worth it for the security it provides.  SHARKK has provided over the top service.  One of the card envelopes on an older version split and SHARKK replaced it with a new wallet right away.
B00CIZCP7Q|5|I loved this costume and I received so many complements on it.  Quality is excellent, which should be expected for the price. The material is very cool so I was able to be in it all day and never felt hot or sweaty which can happen with synthetic materials, I think is is actual fabric but not sure forgot to read the label. I am 5'3&#34; and curvy figure so I took my chances since there were no reviews and ordered the small and it fit perfectly, even the length when I wore my 2 1/2&#34; heels. It even came hung in its own clear garment bag, I was so impressed.  I will be able to keep this costume for years and use again and again. I am pretty picky and pay attention to detail and I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B0053ALN7G|2|I usually wear a women's large and these are way too small for me.  I will have to return them or give them away.
B00KVBHKR4|1|Very small! Gave it to my 10 year old I stead!
B00D50BRXG|5|This will be perfect to give to my friend who is becoming a grandma for the 1st time. Batman is their favorite super hero.
B00GY1HYEO|5|Love it. Buyer should expect shirt to shrink slightly, but that is alright because garment is cut just a little big.
B007P0GGNI|4|inseam is way off.<br />however, the color and fit are great. just hope i have time to get them to the tailor
B00PWCEJ2G|4|I got size 4XL for my husband who wears XL and it was a bit small. He is OK standing, but sitting it gets quite tight. He partly unzips it from the bottom for driving. It is very nice to get into cold car in winter and sit on your coat, not cold seat. The coat is very warm, has insulated pockets, and has ribbing inside sleeves to keep chill out.<br />He was unlucky enough to get a flat tire when wind chill was -25F, and said he was very warm changing tire.<br /><br />Edit - March 2016 - the coat still looks well, and still warm - my husband wore it through second winter, and it looks like it will survive more.
B00L50MW46|2|Nice
B000SUV754|5|Great boots. Keep my little ones feet nice and dry. He just loves the dinosaur look! These are cute and good quality.
B00F1FCRK0|5|I like these socks. They are sturdy and very soft and comfortable. I have washed/dried them once so far, and they held up well. I would recommend.
B005LCMT9C|1|I was so excited for this to come in and I was going to use it immediately for a date, well I was very disappointed. It was way to bagy and the material felt alot like Walmart clothes. Save your money guys .
B005HILKI6|4|The pul lining does stop little accidents from ruining a whole outfit.
B004U7AEXM|3|I ordered this to use as a prop for a play I was producing. I teach high school students, and I was lucky the student wearing it had a small head. Otherwise, this would not have worked. It didn't fit many of my students. Obviously, I was not expecting something extravagant as I was only using it for the purpose for which it was created - as costume jewelry. However, it would have been nice if the plastic chain would have been longer.
B00GXSK4D6|5|THANKS
B00VNPFB32|3|The skirt was slightly tight, ordered for a friend who is a US size L, we ordered a XL according to this product, and the bottoms were still a bit too tight.  The top was inadequate to say the least, mostly if you have a larger chest, as the top was basically just a thin spandex sports bra, no padding at all.
B00K1LSP1E|5|Fits great! Very comfortable!
B007HOT7S8|5|the color is great
B00N9ZIE6U|5|It was a gift for my daughter--she loves them.
B00BIHK748|5|I'm usually a size 14 but have been losing weight so decided to go for a size 12. I tried the pants on and were too big. I contacted Amazon and they immediately sent me a new pair (size 10) and they fit perfect, I'm 5'7 170 pounds with curves. I live overseas, so there's no way to compare sizes unless I order online. I give this 5 stars because Amazon did not hesitate to send me a new pair, while pending the return of the pair they sent. Great customer service!
B00BL93CPY|1|Great cotton.  Worst fitting unswear ever.
B00X7VIJ5W|5|bought another pair  I like these  perfect feet  feels great
B00L5GAIPK|5|It's perfect worth the money..material perfect .. Sizing perfect ... I ordered a medium
B000TFTIRC|4|A great little trinket to have of Roxas from the Kingdom Hearts series.  Recommend this for any that adored the game and loved Roxas.  Worth owning.
B00AHGZCKK|5|the quality is just super ready to buy them constantly, I would recommend the them to all quality above all
B0019EZMCC|5|It looks more wonderful than I expected .. So beautiful and awesome .. I really love it
B005YOK7AK|3|I bought this as a gift for my husband, an extreme Caddyshack lover. I'm a little disappointed of the quality of the Bushwood logo. It looks like an iron on. I am hoping that it survives the wash.<br />Shirt is good quality, standard polo, and size is accurate.<br />Next time I'll look for better quality art.
B00M5MO0X4|5|This shirt came in the other day & it fits better than expected plus it's made with quality material.
B00AMGUT26|5|My new favorite bra!!!
B000GK2066|5|They fit well and I use them to do yard work, they've held up quite well. I'm considering buying another pair. Hard to find jeans that put up with all the crap I put them through. Highly recommend buying these.
B00JCEAY2Y|4|Wallet well organized and crafted. Easy to use. Color is not true to picture posted. More of a rusty red than maroon color.
B00NZXFO5U|1|Unfortunately, I had to give this piece of LYING s*** 1 single star in order to RATE,  however, this jacket has a REAL RACCOON DOG FUR LINING.  YOU may as well consider this to be like wearing  your cat, and or dog at home! Jesus Christ !  PLEASE do not over look the horror and atrocious, deplorable conditions and suffering the animals go through  in order to just be part of a coat. THIS WILL NEVER BE FASHIONABLE, THIS IS BEYOND UGLY!  Save yourself and skip the fur look all together, that way we can annihilate the fur industry together.  And above the animal rights behalf on this object, THESE SELLERS are LYING TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.  So, LIBERATE THE ANIMALS AND THE LIBERATE THE PEOPLE.
B00DQ5IWUQ|5|I am pleased with the quality for such a low price!  The colors were as pictured and the material was soft and light weight.
B0037I1ZAG|4|3 year old Granddaughter loved them
B00JJOBQRY|5|Perfecto, Gracias.
B00N9UDUH8|3|Cute but way to small..
B0073D4WP6|5|Excellent quality
B003F06XQW|5|PERFECT!
B00FAS40D0|5|I live it. It fits perfect. I have had not problems alao my fiance love it on me too.  No complaints
B00BHLHO4G|2|Found the t shirt to be on the small size, posted back to the States couple of weeks ago, still waiting to hear back
B00EB4TLCO|5|The fabrics is very soft, good purchase, I am fully satisfyed.<br />I will buy more in future, good producer. size is ok for me.
B000HXJF8I|2|Reasonable S&H; however for $11, I am disappointed to receive a poorly-outlined, hollow, not shiny, plastic pendent (at least should be shiny clear gold outline with a solid piece of plastic). There's no detail description on this page either. The pendent is so light that it won't stay in place if you wear it as necklace. So in the end I am using it for a backpack deco.     IMO it probably only worth $5 INCLUDING S&H.
B00FPII0H2|5|These are awesome. Great product
B005B8J04I|2|not as finihed as the Zippo brand clip I lost .
B00GQVC3DY|5|I love this scarf, thank you so much.
B001BN40C4|5|I ordered this jacket for my daughter.  Jacket shipped quick. This was a christmas present for my daughter.  She hated her old coat. The zipper was falling apart and she hated how heavy her old coat was.  Instead of wrapping this jacket up, I gave her the jacket as an early Christmas present, as well as a necessity. She loves it, loves it!!  The jacket is thick enough to keep her warm and it is lightweight.  Thank you very much.
B000FXUUR0|5|I would recommend these coveralls for work or home.  The look and fit great.  Quality made product that will last.  Very comfortable.
B00SVYG420|1|Runs small
B006R7INE0|5|Recommend it.
B00EYQH93C|5|Very pleased with product and purchase
B00IQ8B386|4|Super cute. Way too short to be a dress and I'm 5'2. Paired with leggings, this makes a cute outfit
B00HLXX16E|5|Cute dress for the club but not for dinner.
B00KYWS1CI|3|I do recommend buying one size larger if you want the Tshirts to last.
B00G6COTWG|1|The sweater that I get was different than the picture I don't like it doesn't look good. The quality was cheap too
B00804DBTK|4|These are very comfortable.....worth the buy for comfort!
B00RY9ZODS|4|Good quality
B009AEN4XC|1|They were not what I expected
B00EAIZNBO|4|TO LONG IN CROUCH
B00FXMCYZO|4|I bought this cover-up for a cruise and it was perfect. The material is of good quality and I can tell this will be a staple for many summers to come. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was due to the length. I am six feet tall and intentionally searched for something long enough to wear around excursions. I knew buying online was a risk but I went for it, and the thing ended up being used strictly for the pool and beach because it was just long enough to graze the bottom of my butt cheeks. For all the regular sized girls, though, I think it's perfect.
B00CXOMVF8|4|throwback costume that gets great reactions!! for those that remember the original power rangers.... looks AMAzING in pictures!!<br /><br />keep in mind visibilty is low especially at night and in bright indoor lights.. texting is nearly impossible .. DO NOT ATTEMPT to drive in this costume u will crash and possiby hurt yourself or run over a kitty,<br /><br />sizing is on point.. fellas if like me you're worried about displaying your bulge, wear a couple pairs of boxer briefs to make it sociallyy acceptable.<br /><br />downsides:<br />the red ink runs if the suit gets wet and will stain ur undergarments/skin pink. Not really a big deal... just hand wash costume before wearing,.,.<br />i wish the costume had a removable mask... very disappointing to wear to bar and everyone is hyped up and have to unzip and adjust to have a drink revealing your identity and putting a downer on the creepy sleazy derogatory yet socially acceptable (and fun) things u can do wearing a full mask costume in a bar never revealing your identity.<br /><br />other than that great costume. ps you will be cold in this!
B00VHDZLOE|2|Poor quality and too small unwearable for me
B00K1KZ3TM|5|Sturdy and yet feminine.  This chain goes with clothes nice!  Or, bare when my Mexican bodybuilder girlfriend  is on the beach in Manzanillo, Mexco showing off her two piece bathing suit!
B0055WQR2S|5|Got these for my 5-year-old granddaughter and she loves them, got the black ones too. She wore them today as it suddenly got cold in DC!  and she looked so cute.
B00MB3PBNU|5|I got these in today. They are exactly how they are described. Love them!
B003IYJJVQ|5|I gave these glasses as a gag Christmas gift and everyone loved them. They were passing them around taking pictures. Great gift.
B000AOR16W|5|This outfit is sure to please your mate; and you'll definitely you feel positively gorgeous...it's a win-win for everyone. Enjoy
B00GWBPY1G|4|THIS FITS THE SIZE IT IS FOR AND IT IS SO CUTE! BUT IT IS NOT MY SIZE SO I HAD TO GIVE IT AWAY:( IF I FIND MY SIZE I WILL BUY IT RIGHT AWAY!
B003ESKMDU|4|Ok
B00IZOCVT6|5|Great color and perfect fit.
B00U00G7BG|2|my wife likes it but size runs smaller
B00LURFGH4|2|I travel to Europe all the time and have many pairs of pants like this. I loved this look and was excited about getting them. However... This pair is not created for someone that has a butt! The band around the top that usually is flattering sits odd on this one. sent it back..
B000VK12CY|2|Fabric is kind of scratchy and not very comfortable. Fit is okay, but maybe a little smaller than it should be.
B00NH5HHBU|4|I ordered a medium which is my typical size for a top/blouse.  This dress is super comfortable and flattering but I feel runs a bit small bust wise.  If I had ordered up a size it would have been too large.  Bottom line - dress is best for a d cup or below.  It's also I am told somewhat see through so consider your color and where you wear it!<br />I added a cardigan and a slip and its super comfortable.
B004BX9WZ6|5|Runs small so order up a size or two.  Very nice looking, and the thumb holes will be wonderful this winter.  I also like the long length and little extra runching in the back.  A stylish hoodie that is just a little different than the usual hoodie
B00D4KGIPE|4|4 stars because I like the coat but the fit is odd.  I am 6'-1&#34; and 190lbs and ordered a large.  This jacket fits well, except the arms feel restricted sometimes.  Like trying to take the coat off while seated in a car, that's always a challenge, but this coat feels like a straight jacket.<br /><br />Pros:  Good quality construction<br />  Impervious to wind<br />  The neck is awesome, by zipping to the collar it blocks all wind from going down the coat and is comfortable<br />  The pockets are useful<br />  The hood is designed to stand up and protect your face from the wind, shield your eyes from the sun and still provide good visibility.<br /><br />Cons:  Arms are a bit tight, like when lifting elbows to should height.  Maybe a XL would be better?<br /><br />One of the downsides of mail order, it would be nice to try a large and an extra-large to compare the fit.
B00LQDXM3C|5|These socks are super fuzzy and warm on the inside but not ridiculously thick like other wool socks I've had
B00GY4V3EI|3|I read all the reviews and ordered a size larger than I am and its very large. For the price I guess you can say its thick but you can tell its not that great of quality by ends of the sleaves and around the neck collar. It shipped much sooner than expected and its great to wear for October. So far I have gotten many compliments on item.
B00JFT7NI4|5|I love it but it runs big. I have to return it and get a smaller size
B00OZIGKNO|5|Beautiful!  It looks amazing on me!
B00ZG9WWO2|5|Love rufskin clothes. Always fit my body very well.  the new pants style with out a string . waist is a little big for me. Since I have a 25 inches waist:-).
B0017UHCEY|5|Works perfectly! Keeps hair in place and smoothes head for wig placement.
B000QW6LE6|4|It took 1.5&#34; off my waist on the larger eye-hook closure. You must do it up from the bottom. I don't think I could possibly do up the smaller one yet! I have a 30&#34; waist and got the small. There is a bit of fat bulge at the top (to be expected) but not noticeable with looser clothing. I am also short waisted (5'4&#34; with a hollow-to-waist of 12.5&#34;) and had no problem with the length, I think the length is perfect for me. The front dips down just a bit to cover/hold that lower belly bulge.<br /><br />I am hoping to loose a couple of pounds so I got the small as it fits (tightly) now, and will still fit when I loose some weight. I have only used it a couple of times so I am not sure how it will hold up over time. I pre-washed (as per instructions) on delicate in a HE front loading machine with a laundry soap made for swimsuits and lingerie. I also laid flat to dry.<br /><br />I will update if it falls apart on me. :)
B00B9BFJQE|2|I expected this dress to be yellow or lime green.. but it's really a terrible color green.... it's not as light as the color in the picture. And, it's a very very heavy material... I figured it'd be light and airy like lace. Not the case. The zipper sticks really really badly, I can't zip it without help and it's not close to too tight.
B009DEP9LY|5|It fits better than expected and I get many compliments and everyone wants to get one and I am happy to share
B00HS1IHWW|5|Perfect！
B004RHWPIM|5|I wish you have different colrs in hte red check wallets becasue I really like these and it is really hard to find them
B008ER7XJ2|5|I received this as expected. The sleeves were a little faded. I assume it was from being folded. My son loves his hoodie, so I'm fine with it. As long as he is happy!!!
B004A7XXRQ|5|Great fit beautiful colors washes well! What more can you ask from underwear?
B00Q42QDLI|3|I  love this jumpsuit!!
B004D4Y40Q|4|Great jeans but beware that these will fade more quickly (or at least they did in my case) than most other dyes of these jeans.<br /><br />I wear 32x36 and am a pretty slender fellow, so finding jeans that I can wear can be quite the difficulty. Levi's 511s are my go to choice though, as they are long-lasting and well fitting.
B0052XWG3O|5|it accentuates the curves i have already perfectly, i dont find it unrealistic at all ...love it very very, much
B00USBWDGU|5|I absolutely love this workout shirt. Super comfortable and stylish. I ordered all the colors that were available on amazon.
B000P52ZGC|3|They're shirts. They cover my torso. They separate my uniform shirts from my sweaty armpits so I don't have to wash and re-iron my uniform every day. They run a little larger than I expected though, so keep that in mind.
B006LPHJ7U|5|I got this as a gift for a friend who was tired of bulky wallets.  He said it was the best wallet he ever had.
B00O9E45AO|5|Very cute, look just like the pic!
B008L5BO4M|4|These scrub pants are super comfy but run a little big.  I am 5'9 and 132, I went with a SMALL TALL, and they are a little big and long but thats better than being too small.  I may hem them a little instead of keep rolling the waist.  Being scrubs its ok that they aren't skin tight anyway. Nice fabric.
B0081SFCE2|5|fits great
B00B89XVRQ|5|great
B00DPEOAHW|5|High quality and good fit, just what my grandson needed for cooler nights.  We were pleased with this purchase, would buy again.
B00KICKBHC|4|Loved it! Received many compliments.
B002PINNJK|5|Absolutely beautiful dress. My baby girl looked like a doll in it. I did not use the hat. She wore a headband instead which looked great. Great quality. I looked through many dresses and this was the best one. Highly recommended.
B003LO1WM2|5|Cathartt Work Pants are very durable. Although the fit was slightly tight, they became comfortable after the material relaxed. As I wash these pants, my worst fear was that the fabric would not be breathable. (My dryer broke so clothes are air dried) The more breathable the fabric, the fabric will dry more quickly.  I was able to wash and dry these pants in a matter of hours as opposed to a 24 hour period. This is a great product.
B00874DVR0|4|Great Levi's. The fabric is a bit heavy for summer, but otherwise great jeans. Fit well, wash well (no shrinking).
B00C7WC4WG|5|i am very happy with these jeans i will most likely buy another pair very soon. thank you very much
B004C0UOVO|2|When purchased on 8/1/2011 I paid $79.99 plus $7.99 for shipping.  I was expecting a pretty nice table for that kind of money.    When I loosened the draw string for the table carrying bag, the plastic \\"lock\\" broke into two pieces.  Oh well, not that important.    The wood is cheap looking and has several spots of about 1 inch where wood putty was used.  The aluminum legs have several holes in them to set table height by a button snapping into the hole.  The hole's have rough edges with some burrs left behind from the manufacturing process.  For the quality of the table, a price of something like $29.99 would be appropriate.  To put it another way, you can spend $8 on a fold up lawn chair that is flimsy and will probably have a short life or $50 on a chair that is solid, well looking and last a long time.  I would put this table around the $15 chair quality.  To leave on a positive note, it does look OK, goes together and takes down quick, and occupies a small space when stored.  It is just way over priced.  Time will tell how it holds up.
B00F50AFHS|4|this shirt is awesome i love it but its just abit to long other then that fits fine
B00EXIWKFI|5|excelente
B00QR0HGGI|1|Ordered an XL....states it is a 38...this would fit a 24&#34; waist at best.
B00F2ZZO5O|1|This item did not arrive as the same article in the picture. It appeared as the article in the picture for seller Clothes Effect Women's Seamless Long Sleeve Turtleneck Top. It was too small and the sleeves reach above the wrist, not below as in the picture. I should have read the reviews prior to purchase. Disappointing. There was also no indication that it was fleece lined.
B002461DX6|3|Not too bad. But I was not happy receiving it 5 days late. Thanks
B004IOFI88|5|love these
B005GYWMQU|3|there is no problem witht eh product itself.  I love the babysoy line.  THeir clothing is so soft and comfortable, i wish they had them for adults.  The only problem is that I order this as a baby present for a colleague and ordered the 0-3 month size, however they received the 18-24 month size.  I thought maybe I made an error but it turns our the shipper messed up as the reciept/packing slip showed 0-3 months but the bodysuite they included was 18-24 months.  Imagine how terrible that come across when it's given as a gift for a colleague's new baby!
B004R1JSG0|1|Ordered x-large size, received a shirt marked x-large but was actually a small size. Returned shirt for credit.
B002OTT1IC|5|Bought this bag for a trip to France. To be more accurate, I bought it for the return trip as our favorite souvenirs are table linens which take up a lot of space. I prefer to travel light on the trip over (carry-on only if possible). We filled this bag with souvenirs and checked it on the way home. The nylon material is very strong, but make sure that you fill it until it expands or it's harder to carry/transport.
B009NOWI2C|5|I absolutely am in love w/ this top!<br />The picture does not do it justice. It looks even better in person.<br />Purchased the size small in purple.  Has the most flattering fit, the purple is vibrant and super soft, and the layering effect is awesome!<br /><br />I plan to purchase more from Patty Boutique.<br />Thankyou \\"PB\\" for selling beautiful clothes.
B0027YUNLI|2|It's ok but does not hold your butt up solid. It's a strange looking butt when u get it on. And I've owned many so I know how it should look when on.
B00C7VQQMG|3|Its a shame they don't carry xl
B000V6WKS8|5|This item was beautiful. I really love the way the design looks and how it fits.  I also received this item in a timely manner.
B003BO64SO|4|Fits well but do wish the straps were the elastic type
B003MDBSLC|5|Nice bra
B00A41E8AI|5|These are wonderful.  Fit well and are comfortable without adding bulk.  I bought a white and black and will recommend to others who want to fill in cleavage.  I love it.
B00EBNOQNO|4|I love this wallet for the most part.  I with the &#34;thumb window&#34; for my ID/DL went all the way down so you can actually put a finger behind it to slide it out, but this will do.  Cards fit a little too snugly inside, but I probably have too many shoved in there. Will buy again when this one wears out.
B006TLW44O|5|Great
B00DUH35NY|4|No trice,it's S , my wife fell some large,
B00EFG3PWA|5|This product is made with superb construction, attractive, extra button provided. The bamboo material is my ultimate favorite! Washes repeatedly and comes out looking and fitting like new.
B00EWC0IMW|5|These are great - launder like rags, hold their shape, don't shrink, last forever and best of all very comfortable with leg & waist elastic covered with nice soft fabric.
B005TPS73I|1|These Levi &#34;511&#34; jeans had to be returned.  I have two other pairs that fit perfectly, but thee were at least an inch too big in the waist.  So much for quality control.
B00S6YD50Y|5|Lightweight.  Perfect for workouts.
B00K6BWAN8|3|Not exactly what I expected but I do love it. The only thing I found to be different for me is the fact that I don't have a long top body so in my opinion my front pocket is longer than I expected it to be. With that being said; this shirt is a beautiful pink, made of very good material.
B00NTM6AMS|5|This costume fits perfectly everywhere but is Way too long in it's length so be prepared to hem this if you order it unless you are remarkably tall!
B0067UUUFM|4|Fit is right<br />Quality is good<br />Amazon price was right<br />Delivery (Amazon Prime 2-day) was on-schedule
B00D0AE1UW|5|Lost lots of weight and did not want to buy new pants.  So I bought these and they are working out great.  Couldn't ask for a better product.  Had some cautions about the snaps, but they have yet to come undone on there own.
B00J5RDO52|5|Bought this shirt for my husband for Christmas, as an inside joke.  He loved it.  Great quality.  Fits as expected.
B001EB8UWO|3|Bought these for my daughter. The tops fit fine but the pants ran a size or two larger than expected.
B00OP0R1F8|5|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and she loved it. It's held up very well (it's been 4 moths), fit great/as expected and the material was a nice quality and soft. I would definitely recommend.
B00NVES7MA|4|Quality not bad
B00BUCRW4O|5|Like butter.
B0074GWXFI|5|These pants are so soft and comfortable!  I got the first pair and loved them, so I ordered another pair!  You won't be disappointed.
B0045H0L1W|5|I bought these to use a Easter egg fillers and two of them fit perfectly in a small egg. I was able to fill 20 eggs pretty cheap with something I think the little ones will really enjoy!
B00IT8O1D2|5|Nice! Great color
B006SRTFWI|5|Purchased these for my husband - initially got the large as my husband is 6' and about 185lbs but the leggings were just too big. We returned the larges for the mediums and those were a perfect fit! He loves them and they keep him really warm.
B003ZZEEPY|5|match the oneies I purchased.
B00CFI3BY2|4|Nice, very fashionable!
B009WQJVV2|5|The advertisement boasts stain guard or stain block, but these shirts absorb stains, especially oily stains. The wicking action is very good and stays dry in the dead of the North Florida dog day summers. But they do not come very clea. Otherwise, an excellent substitute for a high-vis vest
B010GL508O|5|VERY NICE
B00CIZHQV6|2|The jacket was labeled to be my size but was at least two sizes smaller when it arrived.  It's cute but if I can't wear it, then it's no good to me.  I'm returning it as soon as possible.
B00KRAOPBI|5|I love my item!  Thank you!
B0091IDX1U|4|I like it as a way to show my support without being flashy.  Sturdy, doesn't spin around on it's back, and if forgotten and washed stays on and doesn't get damaged. I would buy again if I needed another.
B00CC6ZNC0|4|I like this shirt for my son, for fall it keeps him warm.  The long sleeve part is a little long by half an inch but only because my son is 6 months but because he weighs about 17 pounds the shirt fits him perfect.  I like the red and black combination and it is made from good material, it has been washed and it has not teared or anything like that.
B007OSHMLG|5|Great fit, fabric and color
B000ROC3YU|4|My son used his masks to create replicas of the masks worn by his favorite band.  The elastic is a little too thin and broke after a week, but the surface is great for sharpie markers.
B00OKA2R8E|5|Love them!!!!
B00QI0Q4QK|5|I purchased \\"Y-Color 5\\" and it is exactly as pictured! I bought this for my upcoming honeymoon and it will be a perfect cover-up. It is the right amount of transprency so it won't be mistaken for a casual dress nor is 100% see-thru. I ordered a M (5'4\\", 130lbs) and it fits perfectly. Material is very stretchy and will refuse to wrinkle. Great price!
B001T4SJ8Q|5|A gift - shirt looks even more awesome in person than it did in the picture!  Would order from this vendor again.
B00PJBGS92|3|I find this just okay.
B005Y2UCDE|5|nice
B004RE8LPQ|5|Bought these for my son who is 6'4\\".  It is hard to find cargo shorts that hit at or just below the knee.  The included belt is not being used.  Too macrame looking.  The shorts themselves are easy care.  Wash, dry and wear.  The pocket flaps don't turn up after drying.  Purchased these in 3 colors.
B000KHKVFM|4|These pants feel awesome and fit the waist perfectly. However,  unless you are 7 feet tall,  you will have to alter the length greatly. My husband is 6 foot,  and we had to hem up 8 inches to bring them to the bottom of his shoes . be sure to add the alteration charge to cost and see if still worth it.
B00KQ2K90S|4|So comfy !
B0072LBVAS|2|was way to small
B004I6QE70|4|Love the pants, they are very soft, read the reviews before I bought them, I too shrunk them a bit, when I tried them on before I washed them, they layed on the tops of my feet, after the wash, not so much, I would say I lost an inch or so. Size wise, I am a size 5 and I bought the small, im 5'2\\", and they fit great, waist was a bit snug, but Im still carrying around my \\"winter coat\\"
B00QV2AUFG|5|Love , Love Love! I have one in grey and wanted another one for the winter! I love this color of blue! Looks great with jeans or leggings. I love to wear this sweater on cold day when I am out walking my dog as well then shopping in style! This material is so soft and adds such a nice layer of warmth! You can dress this sweater up or dress casual!
B00PGRT18Y|5|Always love PattyBoutik clothes
B00EUT4S6E|5|Works perfectly and the price couldn't be beat.
B0061NU5MS|5|I got this hat for my girlfriend. She is into funky hats like this, and she loved it. It isn't cheap, it didn't fall apart or anything. It is very soft too and the dangling palm palms are solid. I would buy it again. Great price. Great material. Great hat
