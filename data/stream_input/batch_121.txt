B00EKW1NEG|3|Smaller than I expected as people say. Quality is good but if it was twice as long I would have gave this a 4.5 out of 5 stars
B007V2BK2W|5|This is my second heat shield purchase for our second car.  Some sort of heat shield is a must have for the South Florida sun.  These are custom fit and are more rigid than most with an accordion style fold.  The first purchase for our VW is about 3 years old and has been taken up and down over 1000 times.  It is showing a little wear but I could see getting another 2 years of use before replacing.<br /><br />Pros -<br />Exact Fit for your car windshield - VW Touareg and Nissan Leaf fit perfect<br />Thick insulated material and reflective blue outer material<br />Significantly reduces the inside temperature of your car even when going into the store for 10 minutes<br />A must have if you do any work in the car while parked - your AC unit will be on 3/4 less<br /><br />Improvements -<br />The Heat Shield has an outer stitched edging that wraps around the entire device.  When it is folded a person needs to remember how they place it in the seat next to them or in the back seat because once you start to open it you either have it going the correct way or upside down.<br /><br />The manufacturer should add a different colored material to the top driver side edge to immediately identify the correct direction.  (I added my Hockey number to the inside top left.)<br /><br />The other drawback is the size when folded.  The shield sits in the front passenger seat, the back seat or in the far back when every seat is taken.
B00KQXKG46|5|Great quality. Very bright.
B00B5V3J5Q|4|Delivered on time and excellent quality.  Fit was perfect.  Very happy with purchase and do recommend.
B00BMRZN66|5|The Terapump is amazing.  It is very easy to use and quickly transfers most liquids.  I use it to transfer fuel from a gas can to my boat and Jeep and it works flawlessly.  I highly recommend this product
B00A7BFOF8|5|I'm not sure why there were negative comments unless they didn't watch the video to see how to properly size them. They each needed to be slightly adjusted to fit my wheels, but they go on very snug and look great! The inside of the hubcaps are exactly like the factory Scion caps in design. Very happy with them.
B000CNMXTQ|5|Nice fit, works very well.
B00YGI4O4U|4|The one I got wasn't the exact one as it shows in the picture its like red and black cushion but k still love it anyways.
B00GLQBDVM|3|Looks great. How do you install it?
B00927G38U|4|Good quality, exactly as described, delivered as promised. I will no doubt place another order in the future.  I do recommend!
B004HMBK5G|5|Works great.Had other brand never worked correctly. THE masterlink works perfect
B00A2Z49NC|5|Nice Part
B001QVC5FA|5|Works great on my 92 3.0 toyota 4x4. Only complaint is I wish it was greasable. None that I found are unless they are twice as expensive. Seems really well built. Recommended.
B001AZH6H4|1|fell apart 1st time I used them! all 4!
B00HB8SVO6|5|Worked perfectly!
B000BO79AY|4|Excellet
B000C5UFK8|5|perfect fit, works good, I was not throwing any codes so it was not having issues, but did notice a smoother idle with it in place. However I also changed all the filters at the same time
B00MAUX45G|4|It's a very nice quality and sweet jersey long sleeved. But it runs about two sizes too small. I normally wear an xl in a shirt so I purchased a 2xl. Still too small. If you have a bigger chest this will not fit you.
B0002M9SCM|5|Awesome product. Cut-off was a straight line and can be easily aimed to the sides of the front of vehicle (purpose of fog lamps). Output was surprisingly brighter than my 55w low beams which is what I wanted so that I could see the side of the road during severe winter storms.<br /><br />Down side of this product is the poor to fair description of the wiring instructions and cheap terminals that were included. I made my own wiring and relay connector and wired everything under the dash to protect my the wires and relay from weathering. Purchased my own crimp terminals and soldered them to have a longer lasting connection that can better withstand Canadian weather. Switch was okay; however, I replaced it with a fancy one.<br /><br />Overall, this product is great byfar and exceeded expectations. They are less brighter than cree led bars but are SAE approved so cops pulling you over wouldn't be an issue.
B000CAXTHY|5|Yes, it fit perfectly. Just like the original equipment.  Happy Camper here.<br /><br />Interestingly, I first bought a K&N filter at more than twice the price....it looked like a high quality product, but it just did not fit the air box correctly...the groove where the grease was to be put in was not wide enough to accept the air box thickness.  It just was not designed correctly.  Shame, shame :-(
B007WU6QQ8|5|Very good quality and fast delivery.
B00O616PB2|4|These do an adequate job (better than stock) but the sylvania silverstars are much brighter
B001UCBLAK|5|These solved the rear end alignment problem on the Ford Taurus SHO 1989-1995.  My alignment shop said these were the best solution they have seen, and no problems adjusting. Worth the money because not only are alignment issues history, you also get all new arm bushings; greatly tightens the whole rear suspension.
B001MSVSG4|5|Excellent product. Looks beautiful. Arrived promptly.
B000UV8FNS|5|Great product , easy install !
B001C7YPCY|2|Warning!  The decal turned black after about a month or so on my car.  Although, to be honest,  I kind of like it black.  My husband bought it and put it on my brand new car - without telling me.  Bad husband.  I thought it looked a little big, so with it being black it blends in with my black car and isn't as noticeable.  Which is kinda cool... since it's a Deceptacon and all.  Random thoughts... the Deceptacon symbol reminds me of a fox... wearing a tiara.  The Autobot symbol looks like it is crying.
B001P286A8|2|Any instructions?  This is advertised as fast and easy installation but all I have is a box of loose hardware and nothing that tells how to install.  Can I get instructions?
B00CSBUOP0|3|there are better ones out there.  mine is starting to split and I'm easy on my things
B001KQCC9K|1|1st regulator failed in 2 weeks. Was replaced under warranty. 2nd regulator failed in 2 months.
B004XONS3A|5|Dropped temp 30* which is a lot better than before and very rigid construction
B00LEBLI82|1|I bought these to put in my RV. They worked great for about 30 min.  After they had been on for a while two of them burned up, literally.  They were smoking and very hot.  I took all 10 out and threw them away.  Not worth burning up my RV. VERY DISSATISFIED.
B003AOMJ7K|5|Seat covers were a little tough to hook up but worth the struggle i love the seat covers i would recommend them to anyone!
B00BOEN4XG|3|This is just a bit too wide for a 2015 Santa Fe Sport with auto lift gate.  The product is just fine but it didn't fit my model.  I had to return it.
B00O3GYZUI|1|Do not buy these. They are supposedly &#34;high beams&#34; and aren't even bright. My HID driving lights are brighter than these. Overall not impressed one bit.
B005K8E9FY|5|bought this item even though the reviews were not overly favorable. I literally change out a valve stem in under 30-seconds. use lots of liquid dish soap to lube up the tapered installation tube, hold it firmly against rim and pop tool with palm of your hand, pull it back slowly to seat it and you are done!!! Did not experience breaking or bending of tool others did while removing old valve stem.
B008YRL140|5|Came very nicely, yet oddly, packaged. They basically wrapped it in cardboard and shrink wrapped it. My car is black so I didn't have to mess with painting it. Comes primer semigloss black. It really gave my not-so-mean looking car the mean facade I was looking for. Says there are indentions for double sided tape but there are not. Comes with 4 screws but no holes. Be prepared to drill your own. EDIT: if you have an electric drill and Phillips head, you can literally screw them right in. Fitment was nice after I carved a curve into the bends. I just used a knife but you have to just see how it fits your particular car. I have a 92 civic sedan.
B001HBWVJY|5|These are great and very handy.  This is the second one I've owned and it finishes the look of the truck and is very useful.  Just buy it!
B002GZ72YY|4|great
B0009IBJE4|3|Awfully loud, I mean it's annoyingly loud.<br /><br />Also doesn't seem to be that &#34;fast&#34;.. perhaps my deep cycle trolling motor battery was dis-charged more than I thought.<br /><br />Not sure I'm keeping it though.. we'll see.. certainly not over-joyed with it so far....
B006VCGSP2|5|great
B00X52EVAK|3|It arrived as expected
B00IN9B0RW|5|The absolute best atv cleaning system I have used! It normally takes me 3-4 hours to make my atv spotless done it in 1-1/2 hours with this kit.
B001FLSMI0|5|Easy to install. Direct fit for My 2005 Suzuki Forenza. Installed about a month before this review and have had no issues. For the price you can't beat it.
B004809YBE|5|Quality product
B00P2KANI2|5|used these instead of $1600 dealer replacement on 2008 Malibu.  worked perfectly.  well built for being plastic.  simple 2 wire hookup.  recommend using loc-tite or thread locker on set-screws to keep things happy.
B00DWKWSTG|5|GREAT WILL ORDER AGAIN
B005146G1C|4|A little flimsy, but it fit in.
B00ZEJGDT4|5|Works great, has an o-ring that keeps dirt out of the filler neck and the magnet at the end allows me to place it on the fuel door hinge while I fill up. They say there's a baffle inside the filler neck that keeps dust and dirt out but mine was always dirty. Since you have 5o punch through it with the fuel gun, I think as fuel comes out of the fuel gun, it will push some dust and dirt into the fuel tank. May not be necessary but I like that I can keep it cleaner with this fuel cap.<br />Don't worry, it fits fine. Looks really small when I took it out of the packaging.
B000OR18BE|1|Tank is taller than outlet on my 5th wheel camper.  First time  using it I had to elevate the hose slightly to get black tank to drain.  Without warning the hose blew off of the connector.  Needless to say it was one nasty mess.  There is no lip on the connector to help hold the hose with clamp when under pressure.<br /><br />The clamp was on tight!!  I made double sure of that. Will try gluing it in addition to using the clamp.  If that doesn't work, it's junk!<br /><br />Added comment, down to one star!  When hose came off we were camped on daughters farm and it was raining.  Had to wait 2 days to empty the tank.  Lo and behold the tank was empty, the discharge valve gasket does not seal properly and the tank contents had all leaked out.  Fortunately it had rained and washed the gunk into the ground.<br /><br />Expensive piece of junk!
B00HZ873UA|5|Used on a ram 4.7 with 20s. Exhaust and intake. It really woke up the truck. 0-60 went from 10 seconds to 7 1/2. Interstate fuel milage went feom 17 to 20mpg. 93 octane performance tune is the best. Only issue is the firing advance was too much for my old plugs, had to put new and better plugs. My 4.7 now destroys 5.3s and 5.4s all day
B00VT9DKPI|4|It's a little bit bulky, not as as &#34;pretty&#34; as some other options out there, but it's strong, and very easy to install, and to completely remove which is just as important to me. I like the dent proof TPO panels, vice the previous model's aluminum paneling.
B00HQRUSYS|3|soso
B003FG61QS|1|They are yellow lights. Not white headlight with a tint of yellow... But veeeery yellow.<br />I loved them until after 30 minutes of driving on my first night -- then I got pulled over by a local cop and told they are too yellow. He let me go with a warning. 10 minutes later a State cop (Michigan) pulled me over and told me the same thing. Also letting me off with just a warning.<br />When I got home I looked up the state law and it said white or amber colored front lights. Went and spoke to a friend who is a police officer in a nearby town. The amber in the law is for the fog lights. Headlights in Michigan must be white. Maybe a hint of color but not as yellow as these are.
B00XZ9ODS8|5|Worked perfectly for my Focus 2003
B000EDOSSI|5|the fit was great . worked on our R.V. just fine
B008Q97R80|5|So far no MPG lost, however low throttle and torque seem to have more pep, a nice burst?
B003CSLOXE|5|For the price it is a nice top, easy to install and works well.  Installed it before taking a trip and ran into quite abit of rain, did not have any leaks.  Took longer to un-box than it did to install.  Well made product.
B005DMOJX4|5|simple install.  the pipe is odd but great kit.
B005VDW2QG|5|Looks great but a bit awkward to fit
B00CMW0SYW|5|Works much better than the BWD/CARQUEST one sold by auto parts store, at half the price.
B0001P4QAY|4|Works great as is and definitely speeds up attachment pickups and drops. The bolts need tightened regularly to ensure a solid grip but it is a quick fix. Would have given 5 star if bolts stayed tight longer.
B005SB6RUI|4|just what I needed  key west and back 900 miles no issues
B00FBGFTTK|5|I love my Volkswagen convertible and this things I put on it the word bug was a neat little deal I wanted one that said a message has been received ladybug but couldn't find one anyway I'm happy as hell
B00IKPGE6G|5|I replaced these on my 2007 Suburban once before do to the chrome peeling on the plastic. The first time I bought them from GM for about 90 bucks. A couple of years later the chrome is peeling again. I bought these because they were a third of the price. They fit and look just like the factory models. Six months later I have had no issues with the chrome peeling. Have to wait and see if they hold up in the long run.
B009PN9PG8|5|Just what I was looking for.
B001BB4LBG|2|Though the item fit my spare tire but the quality of the cover is cheap and stitching is poor.The color sent was black instead of steel grey. Dissatisfied.
B00029KBF8|5|This rack was delivered today.  Initially I couldn't tighten the rack all the way.  The bolt hit against the tube before it was tight.  I simply slide 2 washers on the bolt and that solved the problem.  The GOOD NEWS is I can still use my spare tire cover.  Here is how it was given to me while I was baffled on how to use my cover.  I took the cover off and installed the backing plate.  I used duct tape around the 4 edges to hold the plate totally still.  On the inside of the spare tire cover you should see a hole.  Measuring the hole to the left, right, top and bottom to where the seams are I found that the hole is perfectly in the center.  I measured the width and height of the mount on the backing plate exposed part (where the rack slides over it)0.  It measures1-1/4&#34;.  I made sure that when I laid the cover on the cutting board that the  word HONDA would be parallel to the edge of the board.  I drew a  box around the hole so each side was 1-1/4&#34;,  To make sure the box was drawn I measured from the hole to each of the 4 sides.  With that being correct I drew  line from the top right box edge to the left bottom edge.  I did the same with the other 2 edges.  This results with an X.  I used a utility knife to cut from each  point of the X to the hole.  I took the cover to the CRV,, placed the cover onto the spare tire from the top. I pushed the cover at the center and the tube came through perfectly and the word HONDA is parallel to the ground..  When I put the rack on I simply lift each of the 4 flaps on the tire cover where the tube comes thru and slide the rack in, inserted the security bolt and tightened it down.  In my 72 years I was never smart enough to do this, however within me I receiving instructions.  God had given me a blessing on being able to use the spare tire cover step by step.  Now I am sharing my blessing with you.  I did put the bike on the rack and it is a winner for sure.  Have a happy day. - Bobby Blue
B000B8JUNY|3|Ok it did fit the gas tank.
B009DB5CVO|5|These gloves are awesome. The extra large fit my hands perfectly and they're super comfortable. I didn't know this until I got them, but you can wear them and operate a touch screen phone without having to take them off. Will definitely be buying these again when my current pair wears out.
B00GSAUHB8|5|&#34;Excellent customer service. We were contacted twice by the seller to ensure that we were happy with our purchase. Item was as expected and fit perfectly. Good quality!&#34;
B002935IV2|5|works fine
B00XL5NQIE|2|Cheap plastic handles but does the job
B00UA3KACA|1|It was wrong one not even close was not for dodge Dakota
B00RW1MEWW|5|I have a KTM Duke 390 and initially payed the same price for a cover at Wal-Mart. Very disappointed in the one at Wal-Mart since it ended up with multiple holes and tears the first use I decided on this one. This cover is made of much higher quality and fits very snug. I also use a bungee to connect the lower holes for under the motorcycle. We have had some pretty heavy winds/rain and this tarp has held up to the test.
B00HV1V938|5|looks great and matches the 24 inch flaps on the bacl of our dulley, helps keep the truck clean
B006EGAIII|4|Great, can handle lower profile cars OK. I get a little rub on my '08 BMW 335i with the premium sport package (sits lower) but nothing I can't deal with. I just make sure I have a piece of felt sitting where the bumper rubs to prevent scratches, it's only a slight rub. It will move on smooth (or even semi-rough) surfaces though so if you have little rubber disks or nubs you can stick under the plastic it helps.
B00LBD3TQC|5|Good stuff, . Fast delivery!
B0096061TE|4|It's great however, it doesn't come with the screws!!!! So, you'll have to purchase 6 screws, as they are not included.
B0018YCRRG|4|Very nice quality, and fit my application.
B00BQE5HUW|4|I bought these and tested them to make sure they work, and they all did. they were fairly bright. I did not end up using them on my current project so i can not speak on their long term use.
B00KTHYFDW|3|Work well
B00UIDJ942|5|Was told I had to pay $135 by Kowaliga's Russell Marine.  What a joke.  It works great at a 10th the cost.  Do not believe the marinas.
B00AIJY2ZM|5|These are a perfect match for my 2015 Accord coupe. All the interior lights use this size. A little pricey but worth it.
B0009IBJAS|3|It charges great and maintains really good, however, it does discharge the battery if the a/c plug is unplugged from the wall.  It cost me a new battery.
B00480GYSA|2|Was expecting a more white/slight blue tinge to the color. It's barely a step up from the pale yellowish tint that halogens are known for. If your ok with the yellowish halogen color than get this bulb. Otherwise it doesn't produce what's advertised. But for the same price I should had gotten an HID conversion kit and used that. Don't buy this bulb unless you want a cheap replacement.
B006H33ZU6|5|Worth.  Every.  Penny.
B00R9UV8HS|3|A little pricey for what it is.
B008YFU3F0|3|One of the ballast doesn't work
B00EKTIOS2|5|Arrived On Time And Worked Just Fine Thanks A lot to the guys at Aidos I lost one of mine in a car wash and My Handle Looks 100% Again
B004I0KKQC|5|It was definitely a light for my car and it fit.
B00HHG02F8|5|Works perfectly and saved me from full alternator replacement on my 986. The install remedied inconsistent or fluctuating idle due to poor voltage output from alternator.
B00891DIF6|5|Like a champ!
B000C42S5E|4|Best economical shocks for Volvo 240's. According to my mechanic these are better than the OEMs
B0045DZCPQ|5|One of those things not used very often but very handy.  Works like a charm.  Highly recommend.
B0031BN1EC|5|got them today
B007FXKU8C|5|Blades work good.
B00VMMALKY|5|perfect for any marvel fan
B00VW948TC|5|Good quality.  Works for light tree removal.
B000WK36LI|5|Seems to have solved my issue of coolant disappearing on my DRZ400 with a big bore stroker engine.  AWESOME!
B00B9FCSQ4|3|It looks good. It's a little loose. But ok.
B00OC90BR2|5|Classy &#34;bling&#34; without without being over the top.  Really sparkles in the sunlight.  Fits perfectly.<br />I am very happy with the quality.
B007ZDTCD6|5|The best racing data for the money.
B000BM8RT8|5|Bought as a gift for my husband. He LOVES it! Came with an awesome case and has fast pressure for fill up. Only down fall after we filled al 4 of our jeep tires we let our friend use it for his and it was to hot to handle for about 10-15 min after. But still got the job done. :-)
B00GSAUHB8|5|Big fan.  Easy to install, easy to fold. Works as it says.  Great value for the price.
B00LIAOUU2|4|Easy installation no problems.
B00559PCI6|1|It was not the correct part for a 2010 Camaro 2ss
B006ZGKZ9E|1|These are light weight.  There is already a hole in the drivers side mat.  Not worth the money.  Plus shipping to return them is outrageous. Disappointed!
B000ZRW78Q|1|Neither remote will trigger the device unless I hold the remote witin inches of the controller even though remote batteries are charged. It id clear why this is so heavily discounted.
B007QSAH0C|4|This rack more than met my expectations.  I have used it both on my 2004 Sequoia and my 2014 CX 5 for a two-person Hobie kayak, which is pretty heavy.  Before the rack, it was practically impossible for my wife and I to get it up onto the Sequoia.  With the rack, I can put it up by myself.  The straps make it easy to slide, and I like being able to quickly undo the straps and toss it over the top of the kayak to tie it down.  I bought an extra set of clamps and strap for the front roof rack (I would highly recommend this).  Having both front and back clamps set narrower than the full width of the kayak keeps it from sliding forward or backward (before this rack one time my kayak slid off the roof, bounced off the hood of the Sequoia into the street when I came to a stop sign).  For extra safety, I put a strap across the middle of the kayak.<br /><br />Being able to lower the rack to 45° makes it easier for me to lift the end of the kayak up onto the strap.  And it is much more stable than having a little wife try to hold one end up.  Being able to easily slide the clamps back and forth is also a benefit since they need to have a wider separation when you load the kayak and then a narrower separation to hold it in place.<br /><br />This could easily be a five star product except for me five stars means &#34;perfect&#34; and very few things, if any, in this world are perfect.  I'd like to give it up 4.99.
B00EOGK182|5|Definitely improved the looks of my truck.  And the price was right.
B0066QR7SA|1|Although Amazon car match said it would fit my 2002, it does not insert itself into the motorized tube.  It is a hair too big.  It appears to be quality material but just does not fit.  My old shaft slides nicely into the tube.
B000ODF0Y4|4|Be forewarned, if you get the rear kit for a Silverado SS, you'll need to get different brake hose. Stock won't work. I bought a set of Russell stainless steel flexlines.
B00MATVMC4|1|I have had mine for about nine months and when i first got them i rated them high but now i was driving up the mountain this weekend and i had one off them explode under pressure and the other one started leaking thru a pin hole so were if your going to be changing altitude i dont recommend these
B00RUEBV5W|5|Nice
B0104J337S|5|great color match.
B00LL1ALQ0|3|helemt looks great. only complaint is that when you remove the ear pads, you're left with scratchy velcro. it rubs against my face every time I put on and take the helmet off. wish they incuded a cover piece.
B002GZ7LAE|4|Great quality, fits 2007 subaru Outback Legacy 2.5i wagon front.<br />Way too hard for me to ever do again.  The coils are too short and the whole thing to tight to easily compress the spring.  A short compressor won't compress them enough and a long compressor won't fit and needs to be hammered off the coils.  I got it done using straps and methods I won't mention here, but suffice to say I was dangerous and I am too stubborn.4 stars not for quality but for my lack of ability
B004MDSQ6Q|4|This is the second gadget of this type I've purchased, and this one is improved over the first. I like it's small size (key-size) and that this one does not have a sharp blade towards the bottom. My first one does and I've cut myself trying to open it.  I knocked a star off because of the way it attaches to my key ring. It would be nice if it would stay on my key ring when I open it instead of falling off. It's a minor annoyance that wasn't enough to keep me from purchasing a second one. Overall, a nice little item that has come in handy on many occasions.
B0088YE6YQ|5|Great actuator - especially for the price. I use it to lock/unlock my tailgate with the rest of the doors. It arrived before expected and came with everything needed for the install.
B000C9OXVQ|5|Works great!
B008OADGH2|5|The product arrived on time. Very satisfied with the order and product.
B005N53AM2|4|Great product! Comfortable and looks exactly like it's pictured. It was a little difficult to put on the steering wheel of my Nissan Altima but I eventually got it on!
B003EOXF4C|5|I like this. I filled it up with supplies and mounted it. Great addition to a Jeep.
B008RQD39Y|3|does the job and fit fine, but material is cheap.  Price was good so I didn't care.  You get what you pay for and this set has been in my car for 1 year now and is holding up ok.  The elastic on the strings that hold it on is no longer elastic though.
B00NTVM9YC|1|The gas pedal cover does not attach to the existing accelerator. Do not buy this item unless you're willing to use super glue
B00AN5S7KM|5|Saved a ton of money and working really well so far. I guess we will see how they do over the long term.
B00796KBFC|5|Very satisfied with purchase.
B001C6NE40|2|While this is a good product, it didn't meet my needs at all.
B00WHW227I|2|This product had a very poor fit on my spare tire. The cover was baggy even though I ordered the proper size. It would have easily flown off the tire if I was driving my vehicle.
B00ARUSVZY|5|Fit PERFECTLY!!!!
B00UXKND9M|1|Weak compressor leaked freon
B00TEH48I0|4|arrived very promptly and as described
B0039OFZ3Q|5|The front end of my 04 tj was hard to hold in the road it has a 6&#34; lift and 35&#34; tires and the suspension shock that was on it was new so I replaced it with this 2.2 rough country suspension shock and now it drives perfect I highly recommend it.
B00KHUQ9NK|1|Awful smell I threw it in the garbage and didn't even return!!
B005BH1HT0|5|great
B00O83NNMM|1|-Packaging was sub-par and smashed.<br />-Lights were burn out.<br />-Wired wrong white light on when brake was applied and red on when cargo light on.<br />-Mounting pins too large.<br />Worst experience possible
B00GJ1ET6U|5|Perfect fit and quick delivery. Very satisfied.  Thank you...
B00EHIOSPO|5|I was very satisfied with the customer service. The hid headlights were a fathers day gift and it was the best gift my fiancé ever got. It was easy to install and the shipment was fast. The lights are really bright and they are blue which makes his Acura stand out. Im very satisfied thank you
B00M0CQXRA|1|I am very upset!  I received my brand new, beautiful, chrome 3rd brake light cover for my 2014 Nissan Titan, and, promptly, cracked my truck's 3rd brake light housing, primarily, because of my impatience, but, mainly because I did not receive any installation instructions, what-so-ever???  Next time, I'll pay better attention to your recommendation to use &#34;PROFESSIONAL INSTALLATION!!!&#34;  As soon as I repair, or, replace my 3rd brake light housing, I will have my Chrome 3rd brake light cover professionally installed!  &#34;My Bad!!!&#34;
B009WG296Q|5|this tool made removing my door panel easy.  It is much better than trying to use a flat tool with no leverage.
B00PZYRDX8|5|Good just  i In case of a flat etc
B00Y5EJ3JG|5|Looks awesome
B00DELNHJI|5|I love the mirror.  It's rock solid and does what it's designed for!
B002PQJ8VY|4|The new lights went in easily and look great on the car.
B00BQYCKE8|5|Love these, very plush and very soft. Use them for buffing off polish and glass.
B000PG80DI|5|Nice and sturdy
B0055EMN7Y|5|Good
B00080QHMM|2|Would not really be picky except that the interface with the tire is not very positive. Looks better than it performed.
B00BYH6C1E|5|I wish I had one of these years ago.  I have been using a black t-shirt to the same effect for a couple of years now so glad to see a much more streamlined and purposed product.  I use them in my 4 door sedan and my two seat sports car and the material adjusts to each gap perfectly. Install took all of about 1 minute for each one. After you get the seat belt buckle through the pre-formed cut out you just tuck it in place and you're finished. Material is a slick synthetic and the filler has the consistency of memory foam to mold an d expand into the gaps very well.
B00KU4VF0U|5|A++
B0028JQZ5U|3|Works fine for a cheap creeper. But the way the headrest works in pretty cheap. Also had 2 wheels fall off in the first few hours of use, I found the pieces and re-attached them. Just something I shouldn't have to deal with on a brand new item.
B0007TQWKQ|4|ok
B00JAHAWJ8|5|Nice quality mirrors
B004X2B9II|5|Delivery was prompt and product was exactly what I was looking for. 2014 Ford Explorer fit was perfect. very sleek you hardly notice them. Installation lasted about 20 min.
B000CJ8CZY|5|Work great
B000BO0532|5|Put this in my 2015 challenger rt at my first oil change. Even though it's a new car it seems like it might run a little smoother with the purple in it. Also put on a royal purple oil filter. So far I'm happy with it.
B00OK702NO|5|Works great on my ATV, very bright for it's size.
B002MQAWIA|5|I use this to clean the windshield on my Motorcycle and it cuts through the bugs better than some of the other products I've used..  I keep a small can in my Bike and a large can at home.
B00MV9OBE4|5|Worked best. Just like its own.
B00EFDJB8A|5|great
B0070YPITW|5|The bad reviews are before they redesigned it.<br />Thicker material, smaller logo, it has a Gone With the Wind guarantee, meaning you can fully open your sunroof while driving & the company covers it if it is secured properly.
B0042H6BA0|5|great product at a great price
B0007TV6M0|5|Love it, been using it for years. Puts a beautiful shine on my cars that is easy to apply and buff off.
B007NNKCKK|2|I cannot recommend it. It's supposed to have a little notch where it goes on the shifter shaft so when you put the clamp it comes with it actually does something to lock it in. Instead it just slides up and down even with a hose clamp putting way more pressure. I had to go kind of McGyver on this
B003UXZ6RG|5|nice, nice fit perfect..
B00CXB84N4|5|Finally got to use it was all I expected will like it more this fall
B00GG9FB8U|5|Unbelievable! This stuff really does work. 2 capfuls (1oz) in 2 gal of water and I washed a Honda Accord in in the garage in 30-45min. Spotless! Almost looks freshly waxed. It was 80+ degrees outside in the middle of the day and I'm in the cool garage with only 2 gal of water. Highly recommended!! Tips: I used a wash mitt and some micro fiber towels to dry. Top down, wheels last with a small sponge. The mitt got really dirty, had to be washed after.
B00BLYSR9K|4|Installed Today so far so good took a while for delivery
B00IE63SPQ|5|Very fast shipping! Wasn't expecting to get this today as the estimated shipping was end of August to beginning of September. It came from Germany actually so I was even more surprised. High quality! Mine came with an extra star diamond decal, not sure what it is exactly. Overall 5/5.
B00CIVKNCE|5|Appears to be a well made product based on materials and finish, it also has more fin area than the OEM part.
B0052WHJY6|5|Shipment came on time and was easy to install.  Thanks!
B002W2A108|5|Amazing product by Uni !!! Just follow the directions on the back of the can, that's how easy it is. The filter oil is absolute phenomenal, it spays on and it stays on, no droopy stuff. Will buy again.
B0054YCW62|3|Hooks are week.
B00RDNQHWM|3|black emblem no color.
B003UT3XKC|5|Great stuff, a little goes a long way, saves money in the long run!!!!!
B000CITK8S|5|I already use 2 of these 1 on my pickup that I don't drive very often and 1 on my lawn tractor. Now my new boat will get one.
B003USAKRM|5|Excellent product. Firm and sure. First rate.
B000CMJRUA|1|Very flimsy and didn't fit my 1990 chevy at all.  Don't waste your money.
B00BPEOEFM|5|excellent product
B00CMX20H4|4|great
B00R0424JO|4|Install was simple if you are familiar with the basics. Adhesive on the back of the lights is adequate and once set, they will stay in place. If you're not sure which of the wires is the power and which is the ground, touch one wire to the + and the other to the - on a 9V battery and if it lights up the one touched to the positive is the positive for the lights. If it doesn't, swap the wires and retest and it should work. For me the pure white wire was the ground and the tan/off white was the power. I wired to a toggle switch inside the cab for a clean install. Rated 4 stars for now and depending on their performance over the next few months I may add the last star. Good product and always good service from Amazon.
B007T136OA|5|You'll need brighter bolbs... they look why better than stock
B00K68IJ54|3|Very pleased with, on that note they need to specify that it doesn't have a port for the secondary air injection 2.2L models. They state it fits all models from 05 to 10 2.2l cobalts. After some digging & found a work around the sai without removing completely & spending more $ to have computer flashed so no engine codes come on the product fit perfectly & was easy to install. Overall nice product & improved performance w a cat back installed also. Beware of the maf going bad though. It might have been coincidence but have to replace mine now & it happened after i installed this as a cai not a sai, & this has nothing to do with the secondary air injection either because thats way after the maf.
B003RX2X1Q|5|So easy to program. Saved me over a 100 dollars. I had it ready to use in shorter time than it took to open the envelope.
B00QMWQMAW|2|Disappointed with the mats
B0024E6UE0|4|Great product and will purchase again for next new camper.
B000NGQE5G|4|Ok, angle is not quite right but does the job
B00KZCMFH4|5|Exactly as ordered.....  Delivered early!!!!  Not hard to install...  Took a little over an hour....... LOOKS GREAT!!!
B001AWN7DY|4|Nice cleanable fuel filter.
B001DX7HRM|5|perfect fit and fast shipping
B0001EFSTI|5|An outstanding little tool, a typical Swiss+Tech quality product.<br /><br />Its six small tools in one, and it fits very conveniently on your key-chain. I use it almost every day for the usual small tasks we all have.
B0053BUCRM|5|Have on 09 FLHRC, about 800 lbs - this product works great - on the lowest setting it lifts the bike  just enough to get 1 wheel about 1/2&#34; off the ground which is perfect for cleaning wheels/tires as you can now spin the wheel with the bike stationary. Needed it to be a little taller to remove the front wheel so rolled the front tire onto a 2x4 to make it a little easier.  The bike is quite stable when on the stand.  One thing to note - lifting the bike with this is NOT a one person job, especially if you're raising it up higher than the lowest setting.
B0009H51SU|5|For this price, why not change it every 12,000 miles?
B000X25QB8|5|It fit perfectly.
B00HFA4IZQ|5|Love this I'm a total dog lover and love to flaunt it. I wanted something cute for my car without putting stickers on it so I bought this. I bought another that says &#34;I love my pit bull&#34; and they sit on each side of my license plate. Neither one has moved since putting them on. Great purchase
B00DQJA5XO|5|Got this for my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500 and its nice to replace that metal ugly antenna. This one is small and out of the way, plus blends in with the black accents pieces on my truck.
B008JQKCC8|5|good part.
B005XB3RK6|1|Bought this in 2014 as part of a 1984 Honda Sabre VF700s restoration. Finally got the bike running last month and after just 28 days of use the motor burned up.
B009S7I96I|5|Great product.
B00H93V5VY|5|Ordered for same day delivered, can't wait to have it on my challenger.
B00MRFWAC2|5|Best bummer sticker I have on my truck 😄
B00IA9NVU4|5|Very easy to install and looks great on my Wifes Yukon XL.
B00KZGMX68|5|I needed a windshield bag for my fairing and this is perfect, especially for the price. It has lots of room for storage for sunglasses, iphone, and maps.
B0007QGT34|5|quality product
B0033DUVQY|5|Everything I needed when paired with a Gates TCKWP335 timing belt kit to rebuild my wife's 05 Aveo. Had the entire job done in a couple hours with an extra set of hands. All parts were packaged well and had sufficient instructions on how to use. I would recommend buying that ridiculous water pump tool though if you're doing the timing belt at the same time. I thought I could get buy without it, but ended up having to weld one together to finish the job.
B008Y8WA62|4|Came exactly like OEM, but wish it came with better instruction on how to install it.  Thanks,
B00ODQ6HPE|5|Great product highly recommen seller is great to
B000AY71V2|5|Replacement for a previous Ranger License Plate Frame.  This one seems to be the best on the market.  Heavier metal frame with raised US ARMY and RANGER painted in black & gold.  Not a sticker so the appearance is far superior and the longevity should be better.  I will update you on any changes to appearance over the next year since it is exposed to the Florida sun.  RLTW
B004C443M6|4|Nice vest, true to size, would buy again!
B000HDCRH4|5|As expected and was a perfect fit, came with all the correct connection points
B007NQ7LSI|5|2015 JK Unlimited. worked great
B00Y75QZFI|5|FINALLY i own one!!! I have wanted one of these forever!!! The smelliest place is my car!!! It is the mud and the rain and the snow, the dust, the food crumbs!!! PETS!
B010MMWFP8|5|I have not had a chance to install the lights yet, but the quality looks good.
B0112SRD26|5|Just waiting to get the new car to put it on!!!  Perfect for the cat parent.
B001P29O5Y|5|You get value for  your money
B0002Z2MKO|4|This product took care of the odor from my truck AC system.  I tried a less expensive brand first, but the odor returned.
B00IS46L76|1|This item came broke. The paddle head of the paddle was broke off
B008CQDO20|5|We got this helmet for my son's birthday. It was perfect. Exactly what I was looking for, for a great price!
B0030MNMQO|5|Works best with electrical parts cleaner, does as it says.
B00HB9IF46|5|Shade  Fit Well.  However drilling and screwing in the side anchor snaps was very difficult;  not for the average consumer to do.  I did it because I am mechanically inclined and had a variety of specialty tools.
B00W8LRJFI|4|Great shipping time and did fit my blazer, tint was not as dark as I thought it would be but you wouldn't be able to tell from looking at it outside the vehicle
B0093GHSKW|5|Awesome helmate and price!
B000C9CC14|5|Good OEM item for a good deal
B00KBBL4H6|5|Just what I needed for my RV. Wish it came with a case. The cardboard box won't last.
B00MEVO5U4|5|Perfect
B0022ZSIP0|5|Working great so far!  Easy to install.
B00021XQLC|5|I use these straps on my side by side. I watch all my buddies  use the cheap little straps and I don't understand why they don't mind spending thousands of dollars on there 4 wheelers and will not spend a few dollars to tie them down. These straps hold everything in place and are very easy to release. I cut off about 22 feet of the strap and then burn the ends so they don't fray. I just replaced my three year old straps with new ones as the weather was starting to show on the straps but they still worked great. Spend a little money and be safe.
B000IOL9XK|5|The little woman wanted arm rests and she needed a drink holder. I like the way these look on my trike and they were a snap to install. You definitely need two people to hold the pieces while fastening them two the bike, but not that difficult, my 8 year old grandson helped.
B001L9XR2C|5|Amazing, looks just like my cat.
B004O844DS|3|ok product, ordered it with the extension,  however was missing 2 nuts and one screw and package was not opened. then went to install and that was a joke. the idea is right, it has lock nuts in plastic star wheels to hand install. Problem is lock nuts are harder than the star wheels and the plastic stripped not allowing the nut to turn. had to break away the plastic so I could use a wrench to tighten however, problems aside, its ok for the price and half of a Yakima mega rack
B007KPRU9W|5|Exactly what I was looking for!
B00MOKMDR2|5|Love it easy to install.
B00QSNVVQ0|5|These things are serious. Great price after shopping around.
B006UH5ZSY|2|I've now lost two of these reverse lock out caps.  Traveling a couple hours to put in the water only to arrive and not be able to back up.  So frustrating.
B00LW834Z2|5|worked great good price
B001H1IRKG|5|Shipped on time and an exact fit at a great price
B00H2VVQNU|5|works great but as stated some where it does not hold up in direct sunlight
B0032LV2QA|4|Works well, but doesn't keep the cold or hot as soon as it is unplugged.
B00FL1TTXC|5|This thing is great and I couldn't find another DC charger that allowed this many amps through so many ports at one time.  I use it in conjunction with a large battery pack and it charges all my devices simultaneously  in my backpack.
B00HRXTJQO|5|Just as advertised. Works well and stylish.
B000GANZZ6|5|No problems, so I guess it is working correctly!
B00D3QUIUA|5|Item as decribed. Came with instructions.
B00HY06S9G|5|Great buy for the price. I used in my trunk and my dome lens.
B00SF4O56S|5|I am very OCD about my cleaning and I hate having streaks on anything. The E-home microfiber cleaning cloths make me feel at ease with my cleaning. These microfiber cloths do not leave any streaks and do not leave any fibers behind. They are perfect for washing the windows and mirrors in my home. I have recently discovered using the microfiber cloths to clean and of my DVDs or blurays that are starting to skip because of dirty finger prints or small scratches and my movies will no longer skip. I think the think that really sold me on purchasing the E-home micro fiber cleaning cloths was the color. Usually you find microfiber cleaning cloths in ugly bright yellow but this was a nice turquoise that matched the rest of my home.
B002XLHUQG|4|These are great, they stopped the movement on the trailer back and forth,  outstanding!
B00PV37ZEA|5|This trash bag is really nice.  Specially for those with little kids in mini van.
B003CEFJ2U|5|Works great for mounting my HiLift jack on my Xterra.  Even over my Dephep rack.
B007SZLQLW|5|The workmanship was flawless the paint was perfect, easier than I expected to install, outstanding product!
B000CB7G9K|5|Best shocks!! If you own a ford ranger 4x4 or a level 2 ranger like me, these shocks will actually make it go around a corner. I'm amazed!
B00ZTT41U2|3|The carb itself is fine,  giving seller 3 stars based on they did not specify it is for much see ms250 saws that have a primer bulb, not the newer style.
B000E267JC|5|works well
B00N9ZKZWQ|5|Perfect  match. Well build carb. Cart runs like new.
B00KYB9XDK|2|Easy to install but feel rough on the toad
B000CM2V3K|5|great stuff perfect Fit.
B00JQZ3HBO|1|stopped working after a week
B009TC8IFY|5|Works as it's designed to. I use it daily as a technician.
B00BCRMBGQ|5|Awesome. Fit perfectly
B009IFIMH6|5|Fits my 2009 Volkswagen Routan Perfectly.
B00480J4JG|3|it was not needed the orginal was fine
B000BUU5WW|4|Item as described
B005PZMKZI|5|Good quality! It fits great my Toyota Yaris Sedan 2009
B00NIZZZ5Y|5|Fit fine at 1/3 of the dealer price. U Tube video to see how to install - simple!
B0066PHY0C|5|Handy and a time saver
B004ZVRGXO|4|Bought these for my 2010 Ford Fusion and so far so good! It has only been a week but there is no sign of &#34;flashing&#34; or &#34;flickering&#34;. Works like a charm thus far! Shipping just took a little longer then I expected (two weeks or so) but for the price, who cares haha!
B001SNRGAA|4|Not much to say at this point, They fit my two Subaru and are far cheaper then going to the dealer to get one.
B00C0SQ8KG|4|the light isn't as bright as I thought it would be, but  works well.
B00L2P1DPI|5|EXCELLENT AND APERFECT FIT.
B0028OJAIY|5|works as described, good to keep on your tool box
B004HOJYRK|5|Good product at a great price.
B00877SL2M|2|Not very bright at all. Should have gone with something with more led's on it.
B008ZDYLC2|5|A very good scanner. You get all you need, for a great low price. Recommended.
B002R10FQE|1|I ordered 2 items in this order, nothing worked. Now I am stuck returning them.
B000BQYH6Q|1|Cheap, light don't hold my trailer very well.  I don't use them.  I can use them on a small cart may be.  I had to order better ones.
B001O7PNS2|4|Easy to apply, nice shine. better than others I've tried.
B002UC1AYQ|5|works wonderful
B00ZD4TQ4Y|5|Loved it and expect to be harassed once people realize what the symbol stands for.
B002ZRQ4B0|4|worked as needed but had to slightly modify the attachment though
B00D9GYWTW|5|Very Nice item and good price to boot!
B002P8T22W|5|It fit perfectly and was relatively easy to install.
B001T7JWN4|4|OK
B00NY4TYFQ|5|Great kit. Fits my mini starter along with the factory starter perfectly on my LQ9 swap.
B008ADOICK|5|Was as described and works great. Thanks
B00EUUNJRM|1|Right out of the box I hooked it up and the whole middle of the lights were burnt out
B00029X0XI|4|Very easy to put on, product looks like it came from the factory after I put it on the car. You just have to take your time when you install it on the vehicle.
B002PLHB2W|5|Awesome product. Worked as advertised.
B00VOL4LYU|4|Good helmet for the price but it has the annoying loop-through strap.
B0068FVAS2|5|This is the best semi'synthetic on the market, bike always runs smoother and shifts well, for $30. shipped for 1 gallon, unbeatable!!
B00EA2VNMI|1|They don't fit the plates well, cant see the stickers in the corners. They rattle when you go over bumps.
B00KPXJVL6|5|If you're going to do it to it right. Two years later and things are still holding up good
B000C9DHIG|5|Updated design, easy to install. Works great.
B003CEN0WQ|5|Just had it installed on my Toyota Matrix when I went to the Pep Boys this morning to change my tires(BF Goodridge) and the fit is just right. Also it looks really good on my Matrix and in my opinion even better than the stock hubcaps from Toyota. And really great deal at under thirty bucks for four sixteen inch hubcaps.
B00GDC99C4|1|JUNK JUST LIKE THIER SCOOTER CARRIERS
B008S9CHZG|5|Hands down worth the price. Fits well. Solid quality.
B00J3QM4SS|5|One I ordered had a faulty software installed that caused it to go off randomly.  Called their support service and they solved the problem quickly.
B00029WSX6|5|mirror is great, mounting kit not good.  glue dried up
B003YDY7YK|5|Nice to have in the kit in case no 30A connection is available.  It should be noted that you need to either put a 30 amp circuit protector between it and your 30A RV cord, or be very careful.  Technically speaking, your RV cord is rated at 30A and what you are plugging into is capable of delivering up to 50A.  Your RV has a 30A breaker in it, so the risk lies between this adapter and your converter/breaker box in the RV.  That cable could experience a short and potentially overheat/catch on fire before the park-side 50A breaker throws.  If you put a 30A protector/power monitor on this adapter and plug your RV shore power cord into that, you will be safe (so long as your protector is truly 30 amps and will break on larger demands).  Those can be pricey, and most parks have both 30 and 50 available in their boxes...this is just in my kit for a &#34;oops&#34; moment so I don't get hung out to dry.
B00PJAXP1W|5|I researched a bunch of MC jackets online and glad I decided to opt for this one. All I can say is... Wow. All you buyers that gave this item 5 stars really know your stuff. Thank you for your recommendations. This jacket is about at high-quality as you can get (MUCH nicer than my Harley-Davidson name brand one), and for the price it is an absolute steal. It's durable and heavy-duty. For sizing, I'm about 5'10&#34;, 200 lbs. I ordered an XL and it fits me perfectly. It was actually a little snug in the arms and chest at first but then I took out the inner liner and unzipped the sleeves and now it's good to go. The only negative I can even think of is the inside pockets are maybe a bit small for most phones, but just throw it in any one of the jacket's other pockets and you're golden. Kudos to the folks at Viking Cycle Co. This is an exceptionally well-made product for a very reasonable price.
B0029TQDLA|2|They have seem to draw up with the heat.  The hook that attaches to the mirror cracks easily.
B00H1MPAKU|5|Excellent
B00MUEHRRI|1|Do not buy these mats 100% waste of  money. I wouldn't  give 3 dollars at a yard sell if i knew what i know now.
B003UM9GDM|5|While this isn't a commercial level product, it is ideal for casual home use by motorcyclists. I have a Road King Classic that has been lowered two inches. This just clears the frame.  It sure makes cleaning those spoked wheels so much easier. The only negative has been that it releases pressure too quickly when lowering the bike.
B00P7VVE84|5|Fits my X6 perfectly
B00AKJ0XM6|5|Fits fine in my receiver---no rattling or need to secure it, it secures itself.
B000VLF9NQ|5|Very quick install, just what we needed!!!
B00UJA3882|1|Breaks down when hot and will leave you strained. No power
B009PIKHYW|5|Fits very well!
B00A23V5EU|5|Got here in 2 days and took 5 minutes to change . Compressor worked the second we turned the key on
B00AVYGEJG|5|Perfect fit, well-made product.  Very satisfied.  Now I have a Stubby atop my Chevy Volt and on the back of my '06 BMW 330ci ZHP.
B000F19UUA|5|Fit perfect, dash looks new again.
B009DJLWZG|5|Great product, well made and is working great!
B004TC1KXG|1|Lasted only 2 months
B0118AY8XK|5|If you live in California, and you have a narrow face like me, BUY THIS HELMET!!! I went through 3 helmet brands and they were all too wide, this one fits perfectly, it's tight, but not headache inducing tight, which will allow for a healthy fitting once it shapes to my head over time. I absolutely LOVE the flat colors, and this is the first helmet that I've worn where the visor is actually acts as a visor blocking the sun rather than being short and outside my line of sight.
B0013FU1L4|1|Developed a steady leak after 1 year, 4 months. I bought this one because ACDelco is supposed to be a good brand and it's listed as OEM, but the original one lasted over 10 years, so this definitely isn't OEM. Supposedly there's a lifetime warranty, so I might add a star if that goes well. Despite that, I would not recommend this product. Lifetime warranty or no, I have no desire to change this part every year.
B003FBV8ZW|5|very nice for riding night or day.
B0095D34YM|5|Replacing universal pump I got at Autozone 5yrs ago, this is cheaper than universal pumps online or at local Autozone, and this has the correct electrical connects for my 2001 325i - I was able to remove the crimp on splices that powered the universal pump.
B00Y5HZMKW|3|It arrived when it was supposed to. it had a sticker with it which was cool. but it doesnt fit on my 08 scion tc, even though it says its supposed to.
B000VHXEJ6|5|This stuff is awesome.  I am very impressed.
B00DJSRSSM|2|Looked great for 3 months. The anodizing (black version) completely faded sitting out in the sun. The set screw rusted out in a month. The screw to mount it (which I was told would fit my vehicle) is too short and not the right thread pitch. (Volvo). I custom mounted it just for looks after I found out it wouldn't fit and now that it doesn't even look decent, I'll be pulling it off and throwing it in the trash bin after I buy a more quality replacement that fits...<br /><br />May fit BMW/etc, but does NOT fit VOLVO.
B000E4THCE|5|The driver side mirror for our Sentra is perfect.  The collision guy installed it in about 20 minutes,  and it works perfectly.  We also like the black color.  Its cool on the white car....gives it a little &#34;Highway Patrol&#34; look.
B000BUQOEU|5|These are great for holding down our awning at a trailer that unfortunately we can only go to on weekends.  Bought these so that we would be able to keep the awning up and out and not to worry about wind tearing it.  Attach to outside pole and to the side edge and they hold very tight with Velcro strapping. A must have if your a camper and know about the awnings capabilities of flapping in the wind.
B000CF6RX2|5|fit good, took 20 mins tops! thanks!!!
B00029KA6S|5|When I first moved to a warm part of the country, I learned quickly that I needed a steering wheel cover to keep from burning my hands all summer. The cheap ones didn't hold up; the Superior ones always last for several years. Even on the leather covered wheels of my current cars, these covers are more comfortable than the factory wheels after sitting in the sun.  And after cold-soaking in the winter, for that matter.  A useful accessory.
B00JMQRW9U|3|I was disappointed that the picture shown to the left - has the two frogs basically side by side.  On the pair I received one was up and one was down not lined up as a pair should be.  I felt it was a rush job, or poor matching by the person who packaged it.  It was a lower priced item and so you get what you pay for.  They serve their purpose and are functional.
B00L7UIUY0|1|This product sucks after we stop working don't buy it
B00VH6NIIW|5|This exhaust tip arrived in better condition than anything u could find at several auto parts stores! Price was competitive as well. Install was easy
B000CJSB2S|5|Precision is a great brand. 99.8% of the TIMKEN and BCA and at a 75% of a price. It is a great deal and works very well.  Be careful though in some cases Amazon would send you an Auto Extra bearing when you order Precision. That is wrong and you should call Amazon and send the item back. The real Precision is great but the Auto Extra is a usual Asian garbage. Works but not exactly high quality./
B000A6Z95U|5|factory fit on my ranger
B00W4XH7DY|1|Had high expectations for this. Was not even close to what I was expecting. The decal was just a cheap white 5&#34;x5&#34; sticker with a poorly printed USAF logo on it that close me almost $10 to buy. Could have pretty much done what they did at home. I was hoping it would look like the image, with better quality, and with a transparent background. Very disappointing.
B00EVQI5K6|1|too small by 1/4 inch imo
B005LDBI2K|5|Nice paint with primer
B001GQ0YLW|5|Great value!
B00BR9YJ0U|5|My wife and i put some serious effort putting it on but it fit perfectly on my 95 Ford Explorer. The color is a bright redish mahogany wood color. i thought i looked awesome on my old car that i'm trying to fix up.
B00192JFYA|1|Not unbreakable.  Fell on tile floor and split in half.
B00CB8WM2S|5|Got two of these for my son and daughter in law on news they are expecting. Even more reason now to take good care of themselves and be safe.
B0006Z9SQQ|5|Great product! Very useful:)
B00AFRIVNQ|5|Awesome filter for the price. Used this to replace a cheap aftermarket one on my 92 Toyota 3.0. Works great as has every K&N product I have owned. Highly recommended.
B00ONGTOA4|5|It was here on time i love thanks.

B00FTAYF2U|5|We replaced these on our 2005 Yukon XL after the older lifts were tiring out.  They would keep the hatch up, but you had to help lift the hatch up to help the lifts out.  After putting these in, (which took about 10 minutes) there was a new life to the hatch again!  Now the hatch doesn't need help being lifted anymore.
B00XVRUBVC|4|Good for small dent.
B000C5GATI|5|Very good product.<br />Works wonderfully.
B0006IX850|5|Very handy item for filling RV fresh water tank.  Absolute &#34;must have&#34;.
B000WWSZSU|5|Exactly what we ordered.  Delivered on time and fit perfect.  Good price!
B00IBKWSX8|5|This was purchased to replace a similar tank on a work trailer.  It bolted right in using the exsisting brackets.
B00480J4KA|5|great product. It is exactly what is currently on my car. Thanks.
B005CNNLRY|4|These do what they say.. They hold the dirt & water to protect the carpet.
B000EDOSKG|2|A lot of water comes out of it when it's attached to the flosset
B00NCUS8FY|5|A very simple way to smoke out that third tail light. Very very easy to install, like 10 minutes. Adds a little sexiness to my car. Very pleased
B0057FK08A|5|Perfect fit and easy to install.
B007ZGBLNW|5|WOW.  How bright.  Broke the 4 wheeler headlight mount some years back.  Tired of one light.  Bought a pair of the 30 degree version, and they are WAY brighter than original equipment.  Can see much better.  REALLY happy.  They are heavy aluminum backed...looks strong enough to last a life time.  Will update after a 100 mile trip on the wheelers.  Going to order another pair to replace the jeep fog lights.
B002SCQB88|3|Took it out of package and had a big rip in it. Had to fix it before I could even put it on seats. I guess you get what you pay for.
B00B2IO9RO|4|little pricey but seems to do the job. All around use grease
B000C9DRGS|1|Very hard rubber, almost feels like plastic, extremely hard to get on pedal, kept falling off,had to glue it on!
B001PWFPE8|5|.<br />Have had it installed for a month now.. worth every penny ..love it ..fits like factory. can open and let go of gate and it will not slam down. easy to install too.. everything you need comes in the kit..just hope the shock is replaceable when it eventually starts to leak or losses its gas charge?
B0000AY69V|4|It isn't the best one, but it is good for the price. The size and thickness of the towel are pretty close to ideal, but the absorbency of it could use some improvement. If you are a car enthusiast and are meticulous about your drying, then I would recommend microfiber instead of this. Minor streaking issues but nothing another wipe can't finish. Solid product.
B00G95QTU0|5|Love them
B0010DXYHW|5|Excellent fit and price, exactly what I expected.
B00NJ9MZH0|5|These fog lights are so much better than the OEM and my last set of after market replacements. Easy to install (at least in my 2007 Tucson). They are super bright and look awsome.
B003BZINKU|5|Good Product, fast delivery.. I'm a very happy camper....
B004PGOEPW|5|I have a unlimited sahara and it works great for me. I live in California so it gets to hot to go completely topless at the peak of the day and then it is freezing after the sun goes down so It give the coverage needed to still be free!  And their customer service is excellent! Bestop I really am glad that they decided to make a more affordable line of products.
B005OV35SE|5|Perfect!
B000GOG3LU|5|Perfect fit and quick delivery. Very satisfied.  Thank you...
B0072LHMME|3|I did three stars for a couple reasons, I'll start with the good:<br />Crucial for troubleshooting a speaker issue, takes a lot of guessing out of the equation and helps find a solution quick, which is we need in the mobile electronics field because time is money. Simple to use and is one of my more used tools<br /><br />The bad:<br />These things can be delicate, had to resolver the wire onto the clamps before, and can imagine that a few drops would break the casing.<br />Also, the battery drains fairly quick, and it's a 9v battery so they aren't too cheap to buy, if it ever starts acting weird it's the battery, trust me. Would have given 5 stars if not for the couple minor flaws. Worth more around 15-20$ but it beats troubleshooting without one. Get it, you won't be dissappointed
B0015GVK8Y|5|This is great.  We love it.
B001VM6Q0O|5|perfect match
B003RQBKLC|5|What more to say, it charges my phone, GPS, Bluetooth, and an iPod. I can't complain.
B00WMOIYE6|1|bought 3 of these for my toyota tocoma.... got them just fine.. a week after i put them in one failed.. seller replaced it, no problems... . after 6 months another failed and left me sitting on the side of the road.  also they are a little tight going in.. diameter wise.. a little to fat but they go in..
B00JN2N5C6|4|Perfect!
B005N6XC7O|5|Love, love this shirt and get tons of compliments!! Love the longer sleeves to go down over my hands, fits snug but it's stretchy so it's not uncomfortable!! Shows my cleavage nicely and though it's a light made shirt, you can see thru it a tiny bit but just wear a black bra and it's not noticeable. I lovvvveeee this top!!
B00JREPRJE|5|Fit perfectly.
B00QK40D4I|5|The wipers did not work for my car but the seller did their best to accommodate me. Tip just make sure they will fit your vehicle before purchasing.
B005H7DRQA|4|When i used the cleaner on my car I freaked out as it left streaks in my black leather seats... but after apply the conditioner they leather returned to a new like state.  I am happy with the outcome and in fact, bought the bigger bottle of the conditioner.
B00IEKNPS2|5|Ordered these in hopes of betting stoping than oem & very pleased with & they look great to with the black hubs & zinc coating for rust free hubs.Tops it off considering how crappie the oem one's get & you can see them through rims
B001O0U05K|3|My Acura TL 2005 now stops right where I want, but they make noise sometimes.
B00W5MG8XY|5|Very good tire pressure gauge. I now have of them.
B0010ECUMG|5|I Used these before,  carbon filters, sure helps on odors. Try it you will like it.
B000AME5J0|4|These are bright replacements from the fog lights on the motorcycle.  More white than what they replaced, which I'm pleased with.  We shall see how the durability is as the other bulbs they replaced lasted years in a bike that eats regular headlights.
B000CD57GC|5|work good
B000UKHHQ0|5|I have this shift lever installed on my KLR650 Gen 1 motorcycle.  The lever installed without any problem and the fit was great.  No interference with the case.  (The scratches on the case seen in the photo were present before this lever was installed.)<br /><br />I had significantly less room after the installation of the offroad footpegs and this lever fit the bill nicely.  The shift lever provided that extra room that I needed.
B000CMJQ4M|5|I've had the floor liners for a while now... about 6 years. I have them in the front (drivers and passengers side), second row seats and third row seats/cargo area for my SUV. They work very well at keeping the carpets underneath dry and keeping small amounts of liquids inside the liner. Definitely worth the money and the carpets underneath still look new. I also have 2 kids... the liners work very well.
B0105R1C5E|1|Didnt fit. No list for scooters  that are interchangeable
B00UUBDOW0|5|These are great, if you have a Chevy.
B00ZSY5PN0|3|This anchor was listed under the search for &#34;Anchors for a 20' Pontoon boat.&#34;  It arrived as promised. However is says on the anchor &#34; For up to 12' boats&#34;. No where in the description did it say for 12' boats. For my needs it is worthless!
B00G620ZVU|3|I got the Item and it was definitely used Items and the add said new.  One light did not work and the other light had burnt out bulbs.  I called and advised them of the problem and they quickly refunded us our money.  I like the looks of the light and would have rather received another pair, but they said they did not make them any more.  I thought that was strange.
B002UC17R6|5|worked - easy to install
B009DJV04E|5|fits perfectly, exact match.
B005DUMBYK|5|Perfect  fit
B00ZQ32VVC|4|Googles did fog up when I initially put them on outdoors. Not an issue because soon as I pulled off on the bike the fog disappeared. Guess thats all that counts. Very comfortable and styled nicely. They dont make you look like the Red Baron doghouse pilot from Charlie Brown cartoon. Highly recommended and would purchase again.
B0045XRK06|5|This works great. If you need an item like this, this is a great choice.<br />The arm is tight so it will stay as you want it.<br />The light is is bright.
B005CRE2K0|4|Had to return, didn't fit. But was helpful and receive refund.
B00KPWBBLA|5|VERY NICE AND FIT GREAT 2015 JEEP
B000ETQMIQ|5|I have one in each car. They stay where you put them and don't  collapse. My kids have put drinks in them and they don't leak. Great product!
B0001P071Q|5|I have owned the larger version of this wrench for two years.....based on my experience with it I purchased this one.  These are a solid design that has been in production for over 100 years.  The quality of this tool is quite good and the heat treating of the steel seems to be first rate.  Do not think that this is only for plumbing it is useful for many other jobs as well.  One of those things were they got it right the first time!
B005IZ170Y|5|Excellent seller and product.
B00FGYRYPY|5|Switches fit great and work as they should
B000C16XL2|5|Easy to install.  Just done today, but, so far, very happy.
B000COBLKW|5|great
B00GIBC52Q|5|Why spend over 30 for 1 emblem from the dealer when you can get a handful for much less. I installed aftermarket side steps which required the removal of the plastic side mud flap on my 98 TJ. When you remove the plastic a large hole bigger than a silver dollar is revealed which was used for pulling the Jeep down the assembly line during manufacturing. I used these emblems to cover the holes and it looks factory and great. Very happy.
B004LF6LFI|5|fits well
B00VAVPIVE|5|Fits a 97 civic hatch
B00AA7OFLI|5|Solid!
B0001EFSTI|5|One of the most helpful and indiscreet little tools! I can get through security with it, and unless you open it, most people don't notice it!<br />Found it sturdy and helpful for several years. They make great gifts and stocking stuffers.
B000BWFK9S|1|THIS IS SAD
B00C9R4SE6|1|Bulbs are too thick, do not easily go into sockets. You almost have to damage the socket to get them in. They come in different shades of white and do not match. I've ordered multiple sets, none of them are the same shade. I have a pair that lasted about 6 months and now flicker. I had to take them out so that I wouldn't get pulled over.
B00DMEFH7W|5|Nice
B00L2JZXC8|5|Great product and easy to install. No special tools required. A nice way to revive an old remote.
B00KZD8JV4|5|Great product! Worked much longer than the Chinese version.
B00EAM6JKO|5|Better then I expected! Great add to my shifter!
B000C33LPG|5|Fit fine on 2003 Toyota Mr2 spyder
B000COX0JM|4|Great synthetic oil for all my vehicles, 2013 RS/SS Camaro, 2012 Chevy Equinox, and Toyota Tacoma TRD 4x4!!
B009OSNJNO|5|Love how it protects my key and pick a color is to find it too : )
B0015SBOSI|5|A bit pricey but I love this shift knob
B004AHB2HE|5|One of the cheapest batteries I could find for my 2007 GSXR750 and it fit really well and starts the bike up no problems now for a few months so far!
B0042OV9ZA|1|Doesn't fit the standard 5/16 Dorman line; the black fittings with the kit work great but for some reason these 800-116 fuel connectors do not work at all. The nylon will only push over the first couple of ridges before it gets too tight and then buckles in the Dorman installation tool. Tried half a dozen times, tried loosening the nylon first with a hot air gun and also with boiling water just the tip of the nylon, but in all cases the fitting will go over just the first couple ridges then cause the nylon to bunch up and balloon out rather than sliding onto the fitting. I took a caliper to it, and they did measure several thousandths of an inch larger in diameter than the black fittings but otherwise seemed similar. Not sure what the deal is, but I'm ordering some Needa fittings which look to have the more standard barb on them, unfortunately they are some time out for delivery according to Amazon...
B004HYNGB0|1|This does not fit on a 2006 Dodge Mega Cab!! It was way to long... It was 8' long and the standard size is 6'25&#34; long... All thoe it says dat it fits ur dodge mega cab in green letters!!
B00KLKZF68|4|Brake is awesome but has a squeak constantly when you break....
B00CZBQCR2|5|Works as expected, installed these on a 01 corolla with manual door locks. Now I have automatic locks with my alarm. Great Product!!
B00A82A3RK|1|battery was cracked down the side, top was busted open ..poor packing<br /><br />looks used.<br />also looks like someone tries to open the sealed part with a screw driver..<br /><br />never should of been sold, more less sold as new
B009AD8Y7E|5|The graphics look great and they have lasted through numerous wash cycles.<br /><br />This shirt is made from unusually thick and sturdy cloth.  It seems like it's getting harder and harder to find shirts that aren't made from paper-thin cheap material so it was a pleasant surprise to receive a product that should last.
B001467GRO|5|Apart for having to be a little crafty on the installation & not offered in black after a little paint & paitcince it deff gives the car a completely different look from every other cobalt  especially if you dont have fog lights or use a different style that mount in another place than factory.
B0002BGELQ|5|Makes tapping into the fuse box so neat, simple and quick. Great handy product.
B000VU90GO|4|Nice heavy material and a good fit. Just what I expected.
B00FGR8Y4G|5|Was very satisfied love the mirrors great look on bike thanks
B000CFS028|5|Easy to install system. Improves handling performance and ride height on 2011 Toyota Sienna. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase these again.
B002P33KVQ|5|great
B00A6U9LD6|5|what i expected, nomore reaching down this extender sits nice.
B00XCIL4WK|5|I have planted the bulbs and they are coming up...cant wait to see them bloom..Thank you so much
B00DI95QFO|1|Very cheapy quality compared to the price I paid
B006QH54VQ|5|Always a great battery by Optima
B005FOMYIM|5|good
B0055DVS7G|5|No equal except OEM.
B001MOSBRW|5|Good
B000CLJOLI|2|The product description indicates a box of ten bulbs, not one. The 1 bulb worked great, but the ad is misleading. they did return the cost of the order because of the misrepresentation, but as I see here the ad has not changed.
B000C9HD9U|5|Fit perfect on my 01 Civic!
B0094MDNYU|5|Awesome sticker
B00DI0BISM|5|Gave as a gift. They really liked it.
B00J5CVOZY|5|I have a 07 Tahoe the seats are tan leather and I took a chance on this product and let me say I don't know what's in the bottle but it works. I saw the difference right away. I will no longer buy that armorol crap this is a winner. No smell no wet feel.
B00A1GDI6G|3|gasket was returned only because I ordered the wrong thickness
B00MUEHROG|3|It did Not fit my car make and model, but I love the Camo.
B00I5LWSRE|4|Not cheap (cost) but a quality product.  They show how you can have a turn in the set up but if you do you can't extend it the full length as you're short one vertical support for the last section.  I had to make a turn & just had enough length without the last horizontal piece so OK in my set up.  This should be clear & if you require a turn + the full length there should be another vertical support provided or you should be told you'll need one & the cost.
B00BITIMDO|5|Bought these since my old door handle broke off. Took awhile to actually replace after watching a few YouTube videos but I finally got it done. Works very well and haven't had a problem with it so far. It's been about 4-6 months since I bought this product I think.
B00B60519I|5|An elderly/progressive relative did not realize it was NOT the typical / naively superficial (Hash Tag-ish ?) COEXIST sticker.
B0087UJNWQ|5|Perfect fit.
B009NOZ5BI|4|Works really well in my 2015 Nissan Rogue as an upgrade to the rear hatch area light. A screwdriver to remove the cover and original bulb was helpful.
B003KS59WI|5|Sturdy, well built. Great accessory for my keys.
B00K69YXS0|4|I purchased two of these cup holders. One is hanging in the head rest post and the other is tucked into a crease in the center console (both cup holders are for rear occupant drink/cup accessibility).<br />They adequately accomplish their design objective, but the quality of the plastic is questionable at best--this is the only reason why I deducted one star.<br />Will update my review in a few months time.
B0032H6QJ2|5|best thing i ever bought
B00RW3E8DS|1|snap in half up on installation.
B00WM2HEE4|5|Works great light is very bright installed on my side by side . Bought wiring kit also was ok but really cheap made relay broke installing it was able to glue cove back on . Would highly recommend this light
B001RLZ8QM|5|New life to start up!
B008I2MP0K|5|odor in car when I turned air conditioner on, and have tried to get rid of it.  changing this cabin filter seemed to have worked to get rid of the bad smell.
B00G3BRNVY|5|I get better gas mileage out of this oil, and the interior of the engine seems cleaner after using this (I've had to change the valve cover gaskets twice and there was a notable difference)
B005UGIW86|5|Great Boot Saver.
B00C5MXJ7M|5|I am an HP Products authorized dealer. FYI all Dirt Devil central vacuum products are made by HP Products. These are fine, high quality units that will give you many years of trouble free service. Just remember to change your bag and locate the unit where it can get a good supply of fresh incoming air as it moves a large amount of air as it operates. These work great under the dinette seats in RV's I recommend installing a vent grille from a RV heating system or a marine type louvered grille for the air intake. As far as colors of inlet valves as mentioned, they are available in many colors. You can also connect a VacPan which really makes a nice addition to an RV. I will be happy to assist you with any questions, accessories, or parts nbsoundworks@yahoo.com
B00SILFZSK|5|Real AMG pedals, they took me 5 minutes to put on.  Arrived very fast.  I love them.  For $50.  It was a deal.  I am glad I purchased these.  Perfect fit
B00KH8KHH6|5|Amazing perfect fit<br />Ordered on a Tuesday and it was on my porch the next day<br />Great service
B00NBH6814|5|Extremely BRIGHT!
B000ARPVT8|4|Good product.
B00BITQ6UK|5|Fit perfectly on our 94 Honda Accord
B008F5RTYC|5|Installation '14 QX60 was pretty easy.  Instructions were printed clearly and literally in color.  Me and a friend installed in about 40 minutes.  Construction is obviously solid steel and is bolted on with 6 bolts.  Price is right also.
B00695Q3P6|4|Works perfectly. Use it for a little dinner and writing tray during my overnight security shifts. Low price makes it a no brainer  for me.
B000CQDKFE|5|Fits and functions as expected.
B00CLIWBHO|5|👍🏼
B0060A7HBE|1|NOT FOR AUDI A4 2002-2008.<br />VERY SMALL
B00BGTE84I|5|Very Good
B006QGD996|5|definitely does the job. we left them packaged up for awhile as a backup in the truck, finally used them this weekend--ratchets were easy to use and seemed durable. will update if not.
B00N4I89PS|1|Junk!.. Chinese Junk :(
B00DB3OEOQ|4|I was extremely hesitant at first.  I tried on a small section of quarter panel, and within 30 mins I had done the whole car.  No wet shoes, no wet driveway, and a clean, shiny car.  I saved up the rest of the product/water mixture, as you'll easily get 3-4 cars done with a 2-gallon mixture.
B010DP8PIU|5|Wow!!!! I must admit I had my doubts initially. After receiving this product and testing it, all doubts have been erased. This product is: 1) an external battery pack with two IQ USB ports, 2) a powerful flashlight, 3) a car jump starter. It far exceed my expectations.<br />My first test was on my 1999 Toyota 4Runner that has a 3.4L V6 engine. I totally disconnected the battery cables from the battery and connected them to the Anker product. The truck started without hesitation. I was totally impressed. I just cannot believe this small device actually started my truck. Well, it did!<br />Next I decided to charge my LG G Pad 7.0 for one hour. It went from 51% to 81% in just one hour. The G Pad 7.0 has a 3000 mAh battery.<br />Lastly I decided to charge my ASUS Padfone X. It was just a smooth and efficient in charging as my LG G Pad 7.0. The ASUS Padfone X has a battery size of 2,330 mAh. After the jump start, the LG G Pad 7.0 charge, and the ASUS Padfone X charge the product still had more than 75% capacity remaining. Impressive...The flashlight is very bright and powerful.<br />This product is very useful, convenient, and easy to use. I would highly recommend it as a car jump starter AND external battery pack. The powerful LED flashlight is a plus. The device can easily be place in a handbag or computer bag. It is quite light and is slightly larger than the Anker 16,000 external batter pack. I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.<br />You cannot go wrong here!
B005LXO0X4|5|Great product, super easy to install.
B000CB7564|5|Lowered my cobalt 2&#34; & front camber was way off, these bolts put her back into alignment with out a problem
B00RSOLXFM|3|It worked GREAT for about a month then it just appears to have stopped working. Maybe this one is just defective. Would be happy to send this one back for a replacement. When it did work it eliminated the smoke and dog smell in under 24 hours.
B0083SL82A|4|Some modification required to make it work and arrived a day late.
B00Z80BI1C|5|works flawlessly, make sure you get  o rings as they are not provided.
B004RCSS3I|4|They work awesome and they hold rope lights nice.
B00RSOLXFM|4|It works great! No complaints on purchase.
B009AA8IHI|3|Installation was easy in 3.0l v6 lexus rx300. -2 stars since this is the 2nd time replacing this part. I'm replacing the identical aftermarket brand part way sooner than if I had bought oem toyota part the first time. It's a lot cheaper though and the Made in China stamp on it should have told me that early failure was to be expected. If you're a diy'er this is only a 10 minute job so probably worth taking that risk anyway.
B000CEDZAG|1|Cheap, flimsy, and all around junk.  The lock cylinder was temperamental right out of the box.  The center pin of the latch is a rivet that is no where near tight enough and allowed the catch lever to flop back and forth.  After adjusting the striker bolt almost a half inch in order to get the lid to seal to the box and not rattle around, the lid flew open on it not 200 ft down the street and the lid tore completely off.  Why waste time and material building a box like this and put a ridiculously sub-par latch on it.  It may sell for about $225, but I doubt it cost more than $20 to build it.  Change your name from Better Built to &#34;Barely Built&#34;.
B000BEXWVY|4|worked so so
B00M5H6CVW|5|Excellent plugs.
B00T3Z2ENY|5|Needed to replace the bracket that was currently on my vehicle - due to license plate update.  Stripped the old screws from the old bracket.  This came with all new screws!  Works perfectly !
B008G34QKI|5|Thanks .
B00M9NK7KO|5|It works fine, as long as you are careful to use non scratching cleaning methods.  I'm using Zeiss lens cleaning cloths right now.  I used some paper towels on my old set when I had to clean them last year due to massive amounts of bug splatter.  Paper towels will scratch the face shield and the insert.  Live and learn.
B0014E36KM|1|I cannot properly rate this product honestly as I placed  the recommended amount in the power steering  reservoir according to directions on bottle, found out I have 2 bad seals on the rack and pinon  steering unit. will replace unit on vehicle again, if any leaks may occur ill try this product again.
B00AMPJ554|5|Excellent replacements.  Easy to Install.
B000UONVHU|4|One spark plug damaged. the outer electrode was jammed against the inner electrode.
B00745GNSC|2|Paint color is a few shades darker than original paint
B001EAWOE0|5|This thing works pretty good.  The only problem I have is that the jack comes out of the dash every time I pull out the cable plug
B00651BYGM|3|Looks good works ok
B00AWREOVC|5|I use these for cycling. They are cheap, durable, and they have small vents in top. A pair will easily last you hundreds of miles.<br /><br />Cons: Scratches easily, mild tunnel vision.<br /><br />For the $20 range, it's perfect.
B00KTJ1YWU|1|did not work to be programmed at the ford dealer
B001BY43SY|5|This is the best product for tires!
B000SL0R9K|5|Took it with us to Legoland CA, and it was hardly noticeable, but worth the buy.
B0002Q7ZGO|4|worked perfectly
B000AM8BF4|2|I bought this with an intent that it will come handy to jumpstart when battery dies. No where in the description it says you need to plugin to an electrical outlet to jumpstart. Also I am not sure how often the car will be near an electrical outlet when battery dies and you need to jumpstart. I did an overnight charge on my car battery and it worked reasonably okay
B0041MVALG|4|Arrived right on time, and we took it from Michigan to Florida, and had no issues.
B0068C1P9Y|5|used this to replace the molkt vm26 that came stock on my pitster 160 lxm and it made a HUGE difference in performance. bike now runs amazing, idles well, and doesnt flood out at all. gas consumption has drastically improved as well. great product!
B00BBJT0VY|5|Met expectations
B000PG6MCY|5|Yap!!! My neighbors officially hate me now. I love the new pipes.
B000NE7TJ8|5|These fit well and work well
B000MHNDSM|4|Worked just fine for me. Nice to have an inexpensive way to check &#34;spark&#34; that is safer than the old screwdriver to ground.<br /><br />It lights up when there is spark, fit my plugs and wires fine. What else does one need?
B00NLMEIIY|3|It fits but not back into the bag it comes in. Will work for what I need it for.
B00G8R69RC|5|These lights are great. They are really bright and construction is similar to the name brand lights you see at your local 4x4 shop. I haven't had any issue with broken seals or lights not working. Will be buying more of these for my bumper.
B005ZWM0R4|5|Works like a charm! Easy to use. Reads the fault codes and provides a description of the codes! Cleared the CEL. Reads real time metrics well. Easy to read dashboard. Downloaded the Android app for use with a tablet - worked perfectly!
B00Z9P1FMS|4|Switch works but lights in the switch don't
B008BE04C6|4|Thought it would be brighter
B00GYY2PUE|5|Easy to install and very bright. Exposure is turned down to show the color of the bulbs. Installed in a 1995 volvo 850 in under 20 minutes.
B006MX7ZRK|4|It's very good item, good material , very useful,<br />It's saved the day,,<br />Advise you buy it.
B004VXY5GW|3|I ordered the zebra print and received a black one. Even though it is not the color I wanted it holds trash.
B00JA3BMDW|5|I bought this to work on my A/C at the house.  It's the easiest way to read the temp of the air coming out of vents and this particular unit works great.  Like many others I've measured everything else in view as well for absolutely no reason.  My Pit Bull absolutely loves chasing lasers and she's even knows the sound of the button clicking on this and starts looking around frantically when she hears it.<br /><br />The unit is very light and seems to read accurately.  It takes a single (included) 9v battery that goes into the handle.  Overall it's a very handy device to keep around the house.
B0097SUH40|5|Great vehicle recovery bag!  I use this equiptment on a reglar basis as I enjoy off roading.  This is a good bag of accessories for the price.
B0039VPOCQ|5|It's very good item, good material , very useful,<br />It's save the day,,<br />Advise you buy it.
B004WNTY5I|2|ITS ALMOST OEM PART.  But not a precise fit....so if you have other CF cover installed next to it they will rub. My theory is buy them in set on the same brand Bestem for the all the  L side and some other brand of your liking with the R.  if you prefer covers of different brands mixed on both L & R side, try Sato, ilmberger,  wunderlich,...they're more but precise craftsmanship-like, they're seriously serious about it.  Also, with the insert/spacers installed you will end up with short OEM bolt.  You will need another bolt adding the length of the inserts
B000BNZPT2|5|installed in 10 minutes, works great.
B00RGZWIW0|4|Sturdy and does not slide around the trunk. Good size too.
B00O5UFNEO|5|Great product.
B0009JKIRC|5|I like zymol.  Smells good and is more natural than other brands.  Leaves a great shine that last.  Water beads for months.
B00E6M2C2M|5|Amazingly Beautiful. Not something you normally think of when talking about headlights right? When it makes such a HUGE difference in appearance I have to say again... Amazingly Beautiful! And it literally took me less than 5 minutes to switch out the units... 6 pins, 4 screws and two plugs and both of my headligjts were changed out...
B000VW4DVO|5|excellent damper, heavy duty and made a very big difference.
B004I0E23Y|5|Great
B00SL6Q8QK|5|works great delivered quickly!
B001KSGJKQ|5|Fit my 2007 Yukon Denali and fixed my problem of cruise control working intermittently.  Took less than 10 minutes to install.
B007Z8VG30|5|Love it!
B000P17NXQ|5|Just towed a 9,000 lb trailer from NC to D.C. behind my 1/2 ton Yukon and this brake controller did great.  Setup is easy, with three boost modes which allow you to quickly vary the intensity for different driving situations.  For example, while towing on I-95 at 70 mph, if I'm stepping on the brake, I mean to rapidly decelerate.  For this I used B2 or B3.  When just meandering around town, I don't need the brakes to exert a kung-fu grip at every stop sign I creep up to, so I used B1 or Boost off.  With the accelerometer functionality (instead of a mechanical pendulum), it doesn't have to be level to operate.  I installed mine right in front of my right knee, where it's facing up at about a 45 degree angle.  The instructions say you can mount it upside down if you want to, it just has to be oriented in line with the vehicle.  I like that the display can show half a dozen colors, so you can match it to your dash lighting.<br />Only complaint is that the permanent mount is kind of hard to install in tight places.  It's pretty basic: two screws mount the bracket to the vehicle and two screws mount the controller to the bracket.  You can't access the bracket screws when the controller is installed, so you have to install the bracket first, but then you need to screw the controller in from the side.  I had to use a right-angle screwdriver to tighten the right side screw, since it was so close to the center console.  Surely they could have put a little more thought into this.
B00O4GDEFO|5|showed up pink. Seems quality and wife is happy.
B00B9F4VL4|5|It fit perfectly and got it quickly.
B00LPWKQ56|5|So far no MPG changes, however the quality does look great and feel great, doesn't seem cheap at all which i was surprised for the price. Dry flow filter also good game bros. No changes in MPG ...only time will tell if any gains are present.
B00RE0KGDK|5|Can't beat the price I will be buying more of this
B00E70LKTE|5|Does the deed.  Easily snaps in.  If your turn signals are not working - it's your hazard switch.
B00BQVF8J0|3|You don't get many uses out of this backing plate.  The center of it gets steaming hot and the glue eventually breaks down causing the velcro to separate from the plate as well as shred your pad.  It was nice while it was together, but if you're a novice like me, don't think you're going to buy just one of these and use it for years.  I was able to use it MAYBE six times before it was toast.  Not to be confused with six cars or six sessions, but rather two buff passes and four polish passes on three different cars. (Not all at the same time.)<br /><br />I used this backing plate with a Porter Cable 7424XP on 5 and 6 with light to moderate pressure.
B002YKBPXA|5|item as described
B00Q1F7OGQ|5|fit perfectly and receive quickly
B0006IX87S|2|Well, you get what you pay for. By the 3rd day it's already leaking internally when under pressure. If you are discharging from the hose the leak goes away, but when it has to contain the water pressure it's spewing from one of the seals. For my purposes I can make it work for a while to get my money's worth, but won't buy again.
B00K4WR0SY|2|Cheap cheap cheap! Dont waste your money or your time.<br />Oh the other hand the Vendor was quick!<br />G
B00LFLAM7O|4|perfect match
B000HBM45Q|1|very thin, would not recommend!
B00651CLCS|3|Beautiful design but seems to have decreased signal quality
B004V3QBS2|5|Parts that fit a 1971 outboard aren't necessarily the easiest thing to come by...  Thankfully, the solenoid is not one of them.<br /><br />It was packaged well, had all the nuts and washers it was supposed to, and was affordable.  It performs exactly as it should and has not failed me so far this boating season (about three months into it).<br /><br />Don't hesitate to purchase this if you need a new solenoid.
B00TRM8C0W|5|Easy to install and makes the 2008 F150 stand out as a newer model year.  Customer service very helpful as well as the turn signal bulbs needed replacement. Very grateful on their ability  to work with the customer.  Thumbs up and Thanks again
B005I6MJOG|5|I was a little unsure because my awning was 20 yrs old and I had no idea what I was doing. I had my friend with some experience help me change it out and I am very happy with it.<br />Thanks
B00NFSNAS8|1|I used this pump to inflate seven bicycle tires and two car tires. It was smoking. I gave it several minutes to cool down in between tires and then it smoked some more and then stopped working completely
B00P06H6T2|5|Beautiful product first off, and shipping was AWESOME!!! Got it the NEXT day!!! We will DEF be using this buyer again for our bike needs!!! The black makes the bike look more sleek 2...bye bye chrome.
B00009WC2S|5|nice
B001O7PNXC|5|Easy to work with compared to m105. Left nice finish when used with m105.
B003JNYEPW|5|good .
B00LMM9AXI|4|Looks great...a little small, but the Manufacturer replaced my magnet when the first was lost in the mail, earning them another star!
B002YIACG8|5|This is an excellent device. Various settings for different trailer configurations along with a fine tune adjustment to get the required barking level just right.<br />Don't buy the mounting bracket like I did. It already comes with one!<br />Look for a self resetting 30amp circuit breaker too. You'll need it for the live wire to the 12V+ feed.
B0055MIGRC|5|Just as pictured and described. Love them.
B000CSGWZM|5|excellent long lasting plugs
B000C59LC6|5|Great
B00RB66KU0|1|ROTTEN EGGS;  WAY TOO SMALL !  And cheap, distorted, plastic surface.  Don't waste the money
B00TKTGNRQ|4|It was great
B004I6APUM|5|Good products fast shipping thanks
B00M78820I|5|I love this product. It's super easy to store and works like a dream!
B0002JN2EU|5|I've used this to clean piston cylinders. It also comes in an aerosol can. (That's Seafoam Spray, not Seafoam Deep Creep.) I had a snowblower which was blowing black smoke at startup so I let this sit in the cylinder for 10-20 minutes and flushed it out; it came out dark so I repeated a few times until it came clear then with the fluid flushed out (That's an important step; leaving it in and not flushing it out through the spark plug hole would destroy the engine) put the spark plug back on and turned it on and it blew the characteristic Seafoam cloud for a few minutes. After that there was no more black smoke. I did change the spark plug and changed the oil at the same time.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Nice sturdy bag, worked for roadtrip like we planned, easy to use and I would buy it again.
B004I18L08|5|The light came in a timely manner and fit perfectly on my 2007 Toyota Camry LE
B001OMLAFC|4|I got this for my '06 TJ.  Most of the threads good and bad do have some validity. Yes the design is a bit wonky and it doesn't fit the best of all the other options out there, but you're still in a Jeep witht he top off!!!!  The Jeep illustrated in the instructions does not have speaker pods in the rollbar.  If yours has the speaker pods, as mine does, you're going to have to work around this. While it's not the end of the world, it can be a bit of a challenge.  At the end of the day, it's not the best, but for $30+ bucks, it' s not the worst.
B000RH20T0|5|Tough bag. I had to modify straps to fit my RoadKing backrest. rain cover keeps out most rain. Heavy rain can seep up through bottom. Going to neatly spray on some weather proofing to the bottom of bag (Rust-Oleum Automotive Model # 248657).
B000CPI6VI|1|wrong part...looks like there are numerous connectors like this.  Does not plug in..suggest buying where you can be sure you have male to female connections
B00MEUMDRM|5|Quick service, exat fit
B000CSQID8|4|Arrived quickly with amazon prime, LOVE amazon prime. Exact replacement for what I had. Install in my case (2001 Celica) was a bit of a PIA, The top screw was easy to get at but the bottom screw was impossible to get at without removing the top radiator hose (there is always one screw thats a PIA). The car seems to idle much better but I haven't taken it out for a long ride yet. Price was good I thought and if you install it yourself you will save some money on labor charges at your locale garage.
B003FPF22I|5|Updated on my Acura MDX 2003.  Worked perfect.  Simple plug in...no mods needed.  Significantly brighter than factory bulbs. Great deal as a package.  Buy now!!
B0006303QC|1|Terrible quality adaptors - the thread on the filter will ruin the threaded plastic inserts. Because they are a &#34;weird&#34; unconventional style you can not find replacement parts ANYWHERE....so now I am left with a filter that can not be used.  JUNK.
B00XART84E|5|they worked out great
B00U3GX25G|5|I began this process by Googling and researching tons of bumpers.  I spent hours on Quadratec and Amazon searching through an endless supply of bumpers.  I ran across this company and read countless reviews on this company.  I read through the good and the bad, and finally decided to take a chance on them, due to the awesome price.  In ordering these, I already had the mindset that &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;  They came a few days early, and I was ecstatic!  I opened the boxes, and there they were, just as perfect as ever.  The negatives that I read about stated that the shipping box was all torn to pieces.  My box was a little damaged, but the actual bumpers were wrapped in tarps, flex paper, and tons of tape, they were most definitely protected.  Other negatives I read about stated that the bumpers were not painted thoroughly.  Mine came in, and I can not find one paint imperfection.  The ONLY negative (which really isn't a negative in my book)  that I can agree with is that it is hand-welded.  Who the **** cares?!?!?! It's a Jeep!  The bumpers did not come with directions, but if you have any common sense, you can put them on with no issues.  I love this product and this company, and I am one HAPPY CUSTOMER!
B00IAB4728|5|I had purchased four of the decals in white and had received all four plus a bonus decal in black! The quality of the decals is really high and they stuck nicely to different surfaces (laptop cover, car window, etc). I have had a decal on my laptop for about 3 months and the corners have not started to even peel despite constant use.
B00GBCY5ZW|2|Described similarly to a number of other selections as a &#34;set&#34; where the others referred to sets of 4, this is a &#34;set&#34; of ONE injector. The description is misleading.
B00JXNK1Z4|3|Front covers fit perfectly but not the back seat covers.
B007ZUGPJI|5|Fit perfect
B00GGX9UGU|5|Great product
B0023VKXT2|5|Fit perfectly looks good.
B00N8LN5D2|2|headlights blew in a month...
B00IW64J1K|4|Product looks just as shown.  Works well.
B008PRI6XS|5|Excellent choice.  So glad I went with OEM instead of the mass man stuff out there.  Was a little more work to put on (not 3M tape) but worth it.  Looks great like it came already on the car.  And was a GREAT price.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Great mat for all occasions
B007O5GX14|5|Works great
B00N2K6M2A|3|Didn't work for the first 2 cars and 3 android devices I tried.  Then I dropped it on the way out the door and it's worked ever since in my car.  No idea why that helped, but I'm never moving it again.
B00NLN8CDK|1|Box was destroyed upon arrival. No instructions. Have to cut originals to keep inner fenders
B00VVIQM34|5|Very easy to bend and flare.
B003FID1NW|5|Really easy to install!  I have a 2000 pontiac grand prix and I have no complaints auto zone said it would be 92$ for just the remote and then I had to take it to be installed for another maybe 70$ got two of these for about 40$ and installed both in a matter of minutes =)
B001DLOAMO|5|Biutifull
B008EM5RQI|5|verygoodiwilltellmyfriend
B00OQS942W|5|Nice product. Works just as well as OEM.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Great item worked out well
B00COYNZJ8|5|Wonerful as promised, made well and does the job while looking amazing. I live in Arizona and sad that the sun will bleach it but thats noones fault.
B0037R712I|1|they squeaked horribly. We've always used and trusted wagner in the past but this was terrible. Ended up returning and buying at autozone.
B000Z0HVHA|5|Works great and I like the color. Makes it easy to find at night.
B00T6KEXBW|5|Fits perfectly!
B00B8T1150|3|The screen runs alittle small for my x1. Gets alittle flimsy when its hot
B00PWG6AC4|5|Good
B004W04M6C|5|Love it. I cut it up so I could space the spike like I wanted. Sticks to helmet great even at 130mph.
B00HSHW664|5|WOW what an improvement from the OEM lights.
B00EENT636|5|Perfect. You will like I got a medium.
B00KV07LXI|4|The cover fits great. Looks great, and is a good deal for the $$!
B00HDMEUBS|5|Fits and looks great
B00JQ030DE|5|Absolutely Perfect! they were exactly what I was looking for. Extremely happy with this purchase. Classy Company.
B000CMD9TK|5|Great wheel locks. Exactly what I was expecting.
B006J3611O|4|Heavy weight material, good quality I will be purchasing more shirts from factory effex
B004RNR9BY|5|Far better looking around my pool than the nasty green version.
B0002Q7ZKK|5|This kit was awesome. I followed the instructions (which were very clear) and had this installed on my 1987 Toyota pickup in about 5-10 minutes total.
B00W8LRCFK|5|Very good cuality
B00CIQXKY2|5|Works as advertised.  How have 7 K on them and only show about 25% wear.
B00F06GQBQ|1|Much more &quot;blue&quot; than other 5000k bulbs I have used.
B00Y0TAEHQ|5|as advertised
B00VNJ49E0|5|Looks nice and it's small and dynamic. Not the best for reception, but it looks cool
B0026JJLDK|5|so far so good , looks well constructed  , wish they made the power cable longer and shorter more durable air line
B0066SF3VG|4|Ended up GIVING this to the BMW repair man, as it was IMPOSSIBLE to install.
B00XPDZ35Q|5|They look awesome! Easy to install. Bright and really complements the led tailight bar. Highly recommend! Shipping was fast.
B000KZ06L8|5|It's great!  It was so easy to set up.
B005PW6CFA|3|fast shipping, easy to install, received as described but disappointed because my car was unable to go over a hill while snowing. Still trying to figure out why my wheels keep spinning over the snow not even grip the road. but on flat surface perform well.
B00CPT1ES6|5|very cute
B00QJFB2YI|5|Love my lights bright works well easy to install.
B004QW8AQE|5|Perfect replacement
B008S2AJ8A|5|Love the blue color really bright stands out.
B00185FK1K|3|Not sure if it is the radio or antenna but the channels are very limited and when you do receive a station it fades in and out frequently
B000BTFBWM|1|grate product for my needs
B007TXY2D2|5|Great product, received with no parts missing and works perfectly!!  Thank you
B00D3QUHCO|5|Great Product.
B002MQDY4O|5|perfect good quality
B0009VA8MK|4|fits like a glove
B00BJ7YUI6|5|Excellent fit and style.
B00K0UKZEQ|5|Bolted right on a 1999 dodge ram 3500 4x4 5.9 cummins automatic and came with some of the needed gaskets. It worked the day I installed and have to heard any thing back from the customer. You have to use the studs and plumbing from the old turbo. The victor reinz turbo seal kit (bought it seperately) did not have all the o-rings for the plumbing. Didn't seem to add any power but was definitely better then the bad turbo it replaced. Has only been on truck for around a month so I'll try to update if it fails.
B00EDG0MTG|3|THE HANDLE CAME BROKEN OUT OF THE BOX, LUCKILY THE ONE PIECE I NEEDED WAS UNDAMAGED AND I WAS ABLE TO USE THE OLD PARTS TO FIX THE DOOR HANDLE. THE OLD OEM PARTS WERE A LITTLE BETTER QUALITY THAN DORMAN BUT IT DID SAVE ME ALMOST A 400$ REPAIR.
B009CBH1EQ|5|works great
B00CYLKBUM|5|Very happy with Happeseat Covers in comparison to conventional seat covers.  They are easy to install/remove/wash.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone who has an active lifestyle.
B004C6TYGO|5|1/2 hour to install!!!!  WIN !! WIN !!
B00P9OEZS0|2|This looked like it was going to work as we were spraying it on the fenders.  As it dried you could see all of the spots and two weeks later it looks like nothing was ever done.
B00SI7RCG2|5|Very nice lanyard. Strong and the clip holds. Not too long and not too short either. All in all a great keychain/lanyard.
B00AZPP0Y6|5|perfecto
B001Y93RKQ|4|These look fairly nice. They fit well, but seem to be flimsy.
B000BZXKP6|5|Great job.
B000CPAVZC|4|They work good
B00W8LR17Y|5|Great quality and fast shipping
B008S9QUGI|5|Works great!
B00VUILK82|5|I have a saturn ion really makes the cab bright lots of light
B002YCDU68|5|Installing this into my 2002 Ford Taurus fixed my serpentine belt's intermittent moisture-exacerbated squealing sound issue right up. It's been a month so far, and not a peep; smooth sailing. Everything fits well, and it was a surprisingly painless job.
B0024E6V30|5|Great buy
B00NT0ZYRW|5|Very nice chrome finish, looks good on car. Was gift and they loved it.
B00AESZ2S8|5|I was happy to find this hard to find  bumper sticker that enabled me to be proud of my Navy DAUGHTER. She's an officer and a pilot, and I wanted to proudly display this on my car. I put it on a magnet rectangle so I could move it to my next car if needed.
B00XBKFDWG|5|Perfect color of pink, not to hot, not to suddle
B0009YJD6E|2|So after putting this product on my Nissan 240sx and having it dyno tuned; I got excactly ZERO horsepower gain and actually initially decreased one or two horses on the first dyno run. Looks cool though. Don't throw your money away on products that say they'll give you horsepower gains. Cold air intakes do not give your vehicle HP gains. It's a myth.
B00UBCQ6GY|5|Love them
B00GV85KNM|4|Word perfectly
B003HIL3IA|5|Easy to install.  It took only 20 minutes.  What it did is it eliminated the lazy throttle responds on Focus SVT.  I used to have to push hard in traffic to fill the gap my car and the car in front.  Now there's no problem.  It's pretty quick when the lights turn green.  Not sure if there is any HP gain but my 2003 focus svt is now much more peppy.
B005CNO1GY|5|Quick service. Very happy with product
B00MQ69J0I|5|Patrick and the others at Irishwholesale are dedicated to the highest quality customer service! Loved my key chain and working with such a fantastic vendor.
B00CHDJAAE|5|Right parts fit my car good
B000BL10ZM|5|Perfect fit and clear lens to replace the yellowed old headlights. It even comes with new bulbs for the headlights. You reuse your parking light bulbs and socket. Well worth the time and cost. It does not take much to swap it with the old unit. Simple job.
B00L88QKCA|4|very nice looks good on my cart
B007ISGLZA|4|Talk about power & it's the type you can feel and hear it. Only reason I didn't give a 5 star is because I feel like the components for the heat shield mounts can be stronger and better designed. It feel a bit fragile, but over performance wise 2 thumbs up!!!! Love it when the engine roars.
B004MBS7CQ|4|Product meets expectations. Arrival time was a bit slow.
B00F7GZI68|5|Loved it! Cheered me up a little after someone hit my car.
B00VQL0QTW|1|Did not fit properly had to trim edges to get them in
B000GTZWLM|5|I customized an S&S air intake to fit on a vtx 1300, the addition made my bike even more of a beast.  Worth adding if you have this type of intake set up.
B00AK9YWDC|5|Tunnel bag was as expected and it's going to look great on sled.
B0024GQ0WK|4|does the Job for mophead :)
B00NBPYF7U|5|did the repair job to restore operation
B005HJMX4U|4|My one complaint is that the holder should be even deeper and wider.  I had to remove the key fob and key ring before the key would fit into the holder.
B000E4720I|5|Perfect fit.
B00FSKSLM6|4|I got a lot of compliments on this steering wheel cover. It adds character to your car!
B00LW6O8X6|4|These fit well on my 2011 Ford Escape, and were pretty easy to install, took me about 30 minutes.  The front seat covers are a bit billowy about the shoulders, so I used some double-sided velcro tape to stick them down.  Also, the center seatbelt on the back seat doesn't really work, since it can't be threaded through anything but a long cut in the fabric.  You could unzip one of the extra zippers, though, if you need to use it, it would just look a bit awkward.  I don't need the center seat, really, so I didn't mind, but someone with a family might find it annoying.
B000VLHBW8|1|Top leaks and isn't very tight
B00EZ9NW3Y|5|Sounds great on my v6 ram 1500. Took about 4 hrs,just needs 2 5&#34; bolts to go through solid frame in rear
B001GMX9GS|5|fast shipping I had it within a week we were going to go camping that next weekend hoping it would be here so I can hook up my camper product works great hooked up to SUV perfectly thank you so much
B002HCAXR4|5|this is my 2nd wix air filter. After pulling the one I put in at 30k - I had no rips or tears. It was appropriately dirty and did a great job for the last 30k. Expect no problems from the new one.
B000MK4GPI|5|A little short but nothing a large garment won't fix
B00VXWPZ0Y|5|Perfect  mats for the slushy Cincinnati winters. Great price and beyond fast shipping. The only issue would be a packing issue. The rear mat should be rolled instead of folded to avoid kinks but that is nothing a good hot day wont fix.<br />I look forward to dealing with you again.
B007NEN0M6|5|Nice
B002JH469I|5|Cool!
B002ZTOCH6|5|Great product
B00IIWF90S|4|They look good. They work well.<br />The only gripe I have is that I sometimes have brake squeal when applying the brakes.
B00859HI12|5|Good
B00CPGQ1GO|4|works
B00HUM5CDG|5|It pays to get a shade customized for your car.  I tried others that wouldn't stay up even with the visors in place.  This shade was simple and fit well.  The interior was protected from the sun and surprisingly cool.  Yes, it rolls up larger than those foldable disk things, but it also really works.
B004HDY8Z4|2|Fit the vehicle fine, started squealing within the first year.  There was a lot of pad left when I replaced them with semi-metallic.
B0031BNCSM|5|I used this to install some drag specialties t-bar for a harley.  Worked great and looks good, plus it adds 1 more inch of rise to your handle bars.
B00IQFDBOI|5|perfect fit love the price
B00KCRT4F8|5|Received before the date... Very nice
B00280BL9O|5|good value...no problems...
B0076C8WLE|4|Very good coverage and protection for the price.  Only complaint is the cover picks up lint from sweaters or from towels.  But I love it and would definitely recommend to a friend.
B007GRGH0C|5|Very Nice item and good price to boot....not to mention what a new awesome deep sound and increased performance!
B00DMBMBLA|4|Shipped quickly. Was exactly as described. Lots of small surface scratches but can't see them unless your face is a foot away. Overall I'm satisfied. Lost another one shortly after getting this one because I didn't have it seated tight. I didn't hesitate to order another one from them.
B00H3TMKOK|5|Perfect fit, beautiful chrome
B001LA18W2|5|This sticker is adorable and easy to apply.
B00M0DHC06|5|Beautiful, thick,shiny emblems. Looks awesome
B0034NXJTO|5|Just installed these on my mk5 Jetta Sportwagen a few days ago. Installation instructions were clear and easy to follow. I'll follow up with a performance review once I've put a few miles on them.
B008XSUEJS|2|This is more like foam and not rubber at all.
B00AOCN70O|2|Works great, but always has a terrible gasoline smell
B00ED6ZK5W|1|This product did not fit my vehicle despite the online documentation indicating that it would fit.
B000ZAPXBG|5|Great fit and looks very classy!  Love it over my leather here in Phoenix.
B0009N0W60|5|Very cool.
B0009IBJE4|5|Works GREAT
B000XOKNJG|5|Great bag installs easily, I put it on it rained for 2 days and I can say waterproof zipper covers work great, and straps are good quality and don't slide.now I will spray w waterproof spray just for peace of mind. BUY IT YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
B003AOEAHC|1|Ok, anyone that gave this anything more than one star review obviously didn't actually USE it.<br /><br />1. The roll bar and the fire extinguisher are both round. That means that this thing can either be tight on the roll bar and loose on the fire extinguisher or vice-versa. Forget about it staying secure on a trail.<br />2. Speaking of trails, if you DO manage to get it tight enough to keep the fire extinguisher from flopping around you won't be able to pull it out of this thing quickly in the event of an emergency on the trail.<br />3. It's not even remotely rugged. After 3 attempts to get the thing on tight enough to be usable, it ripped into two pieces.<br /><br />Waste your money elsewhere, this thing's for mall crawlers and cheapskates.
B00DQ9SRPC|5|well made
B000M5ZWBA|5|no issues
B0016LG0CY|5|I was build a solar panel kit. This is my first attend and turn out work out prefect as i expected
B008N3JTRG|5|great kit and came with everything.
B004W4MEC2|4|look very nice ...but... halos could be little more stronger
B002R38TCE|5|Great for a rag top cleaning brush
B004XRGGG8|5|Looks shiny and great
B001F1VZ8O|5|Fit right on my bike
B000B8N3MS|5|Its a gas cap... nothing more
B00ELJ9A3O|1|very little
B00LGDQSZ6|5|Excellent Quality
B00AR0PCFG|4|Worked good but needs the option to disable the post-cat oxygen sensors. Also it runs pretty slow.<br /><br />Overall a decent buy
B001KQB5V6|5|Excellent
B004QNTH42|4|This Coilover kit put my life in jeopardy. First off i recieved my Ksport kit with the &#34;Parts List Enclosed&#34; bag ripped off the box and definatly a few key items missing from the box. Since i had all the pieces to put the rear on i did so and lowered it modestly. I drove it for under a day before 1 of the bolts for the rear upper shock snapped it is a 12.8 claimed rated bolt this is bs. KSPORT is definatly pushing overrated bolts because no way a 12.8 bolts snaps like it did when i had them torqued to spec straight out of the Haynes manual. I am not only disappointed in amazon giving me this package with crap missing and parts list ripped off but all pissed at Ksport for almost destroying my Cadillac and causing me a huge headache besides indangering my life. Hell if i had my interior and trunk back in i wouldn't of noticed the snapped bolt and i would have ended up in a ditch.  And they want me to wait over 3 weeks for a replacement is this a joke i got the first one in 3days this is ridiculous im going to just pay more for someone to beat proper bolts into these KSport topmounts.  Well got the broken rear topmount bolt fixed for 170dollars and the front struts on and wheel alighnment bringing the total to 870 dollars. I already had whole car ripped appart for them since i did rear myself but didnt want to do the fronts then that bolt snapped right after driving i think the final conclusion on it is a faulty bolt guess i should be that suprised. Few people on Cadillac forums mention shotty quality control on these coilovers soooo. The kit should of really had more rubber spring guards cause i feel like these 10k springs make some noise unless its just cause they brand new.  Other than that whole mess these coilovers have actually met if not exceeded my expectations. The ride quality is a bit on the harsh side especially on harshest setting lmao. I love them the adjustment is very easy once they are on those 10K racing springs though are pretty nice.  Totalinvestment came to about 1900 dollars though to get these on should of been 1750 if it hadnt been for the quality control issue. Definatly saved myself some money doing the rears myself on my 2004 CTS.
B00029WYEY|5|Cleaned my re-usable filter on my car with this stuff it works like a charm
B010RTGIQI|5|great product easy to install.  i wish everyone sold products that actully worked as good as these do.  This sure beats spending over $200.00 per cable at the dealership.  great product.
B003ZMDOXK|5|Smells goooood!
B00EC0YY4M|1|did not fit my model car, even thought is says it did....
B010C8FAWW|5|Made all my friend laugh when I gave them theirs.
B008ZDYLC2|5|this far surpassed what I expected,it out performs my snap on at a fraction of the cost I keep this one with me all the time
B00QVMHI74|5|Received exactly as ordered by product description. Very fast shipping and reasonable price. Will buy again if needed.
B00MR3P9HW|5|Excellent
B001V8RYTA|5|this was a gift for son and future daughter in law
B00HZX4R3G|5|I would buy again.
B00F4MQJ5O|5|This light bar was just as bright as my buddy's $600 bar. Couldn't ask for more at this price.
B00TO3Y96K|5|Does not pull your hair.
B0009N30EQ|5|This works very well to hold all the important papers.
B000E8T810|5|Outstanding filter. Made in the USA. Has grippy textured surface which allows me to get a good hold of the filter, this allows me to hand tighten them on the engine more efficiently.
B007QBR8TW|5|I replaced the 130 amp OEM alternator on my 2002 GMC Yukon with this new ACDelco 335-1092 (145 amp) and it was a perfect fit.  Great price for a NEW alternator and no core charge or return to deal with.  Had the job done in under 30 minutes.  Yukon now has 200,000 miles on it and going strong.
B001C4SKX2|5|Right off the bat, I'm getting better mileage. Well worth the initial outlay.
B009LZQV3U|5|Worked perfectly on Acura TSX and 1/2 the price the dealer wanted for just a single replacement bolt.
B00A8MZ7IA|3|I expected a higher quality microfiber. These are just ok, they need to be thicker. A good sign of a bad microfiber towel is that the towel sticks to your fingers. These stick to your fingers, not as bad as really cheap towels, but definitely not like a premium microfiber towel. This would be a better deal if it was priced lower which would match the quality. A good microfiber towel is a good investment as it makes a drastic difference in car care and ease of use.
B000CBVEJ8|5|Great
B00846HT38|5|Looks good on my car and I also have good reception
B00CMY1P9M|5|Works GREAT. Product delivered on time and well packaged. The engraving on the keychain is nice and the keyring disconnects well. I keep my vehicle key separate from other keys so that the weight of the entire keychain doesn't wear on my ignition switch and cause issues down the road. Overall a nicely made, well built keychain for a great price.
B000QFX9AC|4|So far enjoy the bags and seem to be working well after a month and a half
B003VZLJFG|5|I bought the Rain-X based on reviews on several websites, including Amazon, and on prior good experiences with other Rain-X products. Saving 15% by ordering through subscribe & save made it a great deal. My 2007 Mazda MX-5 had one horribly fogged headlight. The other had been replaced about a year after purchase and it was fogged too, but not nearly so badly (perhaps they upgraded the plastic during that interval). The kit comes with easy to follow instructions - basically you &#34;sand&#34; in 3-steps the headlight following a specified pattern with small pads (wish they were a little larger, but then again, that might not work on smaller lights) and a lubricant, then polish with a microfiber cloth and restorer/polish, and finally finish with a sealant. Don't despair as you work through the steps - you can tell you are removing gunk and perhaps a thin layer of plastic and things look bad - but after applying the final sealant the headlight looks 99% factory new. I am impressed! The kit is complete, the only additional things you need are paper towels and water. Based on the amount I used, the kit should restore several vehicles. Don't know yet about longevity but I doubt it is a permanent fix - if it gives me 6 months or more I'll be happy.
B00P1C2LO0|5|Exact description!
B0058OU904|1|Not really what I expected.  Doesn't quite fit the visor.
B000CB3X4W|5|These are an inexpensive way to keep good wipers on your vehicle.  Make sure to measure the size you need. I usually get several and then keep an extra set in the car to change them out easily when the old ones start to streak. These last for months--and that is saying something because we live in Texas and the sun/heat out here is no joke.
B000PKX0KM|5|Flawless match to 96 Impala SS.  I was initially skeptical with any color coat to match the inside of the car I am trying to restore.  I took a chance and sprayed the dash pad and it perfectly matched.  I could not ask for any better.
B00CFCHSZG|3|I bought these because my new car is previously owned and does not have floor mats. I was unwilling to pay the ungodly amount of money the car manufacturer wanted for replacements.<br /><br />These mats stay in place well, much better than other's I've used, however the carpeting on them began thinning immediately after I started using them. I've had them for a little over a month, and already there is a bald spot where my heel rests as I drive. The mats are a decent value for the price, and matched the interior of my car perfectly, but I know I'm going to have to replace them before the year is out.
B005OZ5GXC|3|Fits good. The goldish tint across the entire picture was a little misleading to me. I figured it was a bad photo, and thought that the color of the cap could be silver to match my silver rims. The light gold cap is better than no cap I guess.
B001SG7U2G|5|Ok
B00BD55Y52|1|Absolute garbage. Checked before I purchased that they would fit the make/model of my vehicle but they did not. Too small. Cheap material. One of the elastic straps used to attach the seat cover broke while I was trying to put it on the seat. Save your money or risk getting what you paid for.
B003G9I4DW|5|Purchased as an on-hand spare.  Friend had one burn out while camping and had to revert to propane until the part could be replaced.
B000IE0EZO|5|I have not had to use this product thank God! But I feel safer knowing that if we ever to need to break a window we are prepared. We have this on our car keys.
B0009N0W60|5|Perfect
B000COA1SA|5|Great price, fast shipping.
B000C59SUG|3|Only an oem replacement, can easily extend and compress shock with hands telling me that it isnt that  strong.  Great price with lifetime free replacement if bought at orielly auto parts, cant really go wrong.  I had this shock ,but decided i need more strength and control with bigger tires.so i bout the rancho version ($55)  well worth the 20 premium. Cynlyder is fatter and  stronger, very hard to compress by hand to body wieght of force. That being said  i had  no issues with the monroe for defects or build quality.<br /><br />Now to the install ,  wow  what fun!!  To remove the factory stabilizer  as mentioned before  whats looks&#34;easy &#34;turns into a nightmare - long story short, a 4 lb slegde , balljoint/pitmin puller, grinder, drill.  I finally got it out with a torch and pickle fork!
B00GHSD3O4|4|As advertised.
B00LWDVKD0|4|great addition
B001XLG5FE|5|I took my1996 Miata to a large car show and put this on and I made a set of teeth for the grill and had a flock of kids AND parents want to take pictures with it.
B00I548REE|5|Came quickly, everything was in the package that was required to install it.  Instructions were good.  It required 3 different sized wrenches.  Using a 1/2&#34; breaker bar was required for the 13/16&#34; socket.  Suggest using either a deep well socket or a 2&#34; or better extension for the 13/16&#34; socket.  My wife loves the step rail and it looks good on my truck!
B000CGB4PW|5|easy to install and works as it should
B005S5E2HO|5|This is my 3rd towing harness and I can finally say I am happy and comfortable with the thoughts that I don't have to mess with the wiring (from my car) again.<br /><br />I bought a Curt harness and installed it a few years back.  All was fine and then 1 day half of the lights weren't working.  I tried everything.  I got them to send me a new one to replace the old one and I ended up with the same exact issue.  I started to think it was my car or something else.  I bypassed the box on the Curt harness on the white wire and it worked fine...for a little while.<br /><br />This year when I went to use my boat and half working harness, I decided to do some research.  Turns out that my issue happened to be very common with that brand.  I ordered this Tow Ready harness under recommendations of reviews I was reading and I couldn't have been happier.  This harness looks and feels like it will withstand time riding in the back of my car.  It was very simple to install as was the other one, but it feels a lot more rugged.<br /><br />I am hoping my trailer wiring issues are finally over.  Well we all know that's impossible, but here's to hoping I only need to worry about TRAILER wiring issues from now on.
B0078J1VH2|5|Great price and quality
B00BFDH9XM|5|TERRIFIC PURCHASE MY CAR NEEDED IT BAD
B008G1WVO8|5|Perfect fit to my 2003 Dodge Durango. Fast shipping.
B00ZC20NUS|5|Wow, I just received this amazing tool in the mail today and I could hardly wait to use it. The first thing I did was test the tire pressure in the tires on my truck, the LED readout was awesome and easy to read, so much better than my old tire gage. Get yourself one quick before they are all gone.
B00HQFB538|5|Works perfectly.
B000EFGWIU|1|Falls apart within weeks.
B00JQ1S736|1|didn't fit my 87 Honda crx
B00EHIOSPO|5|Fast shipping easy install works great
B000EW0KHW|2|Very hard to use and I am a mechanic however if you have more time than money it will get the job done.
B002692308|5|Looks like OEM and has the foam tape needed to attach it to the tailgate to keep it from falling off.
B006GJPUW2|5|must have the only way to go
B000CN5GQS|5|Not even sure what this bushing is originally intended for but I used it for my 2002 Volvo S80 T6 (P2 platform). This bushing worked great for replacing the original rubber factory bushing that was beyond salvaging. This is for the LOWER TORQUE MOUNT (SMALL ORIGINALLY SOLID BUSHING). NOT THE LARGE OBLONG SHAPED ONE. No one makes such a poly bushing for this. Do not use the supplied metal sleeve. Reuse the factory one.
B005M4GC74|5|Got here promptly. I appreciate it!
B00WUFSLZ4|5|fit good
B00BRNUCBG|5|I read a lot of mixed reviews on these cheap little bluetooth readers. Luckily mine has worked 100%. Ive used it on several of my cars and friends cars without any issue.
B0094V9GK6|5|Easy to install and worked great!!
B00Z01MUDO|5|Kelly, the owner called me personally to explain the situation with my package not arriving.<br /><br />Post Office screwed-up royally on this one so it was not Elites mistake.<br /><br />Thanks for calling me Kelly to shed some light on this.<br /><br />J.K. Thomas Motor Cars<br />Spokane Valley, WA
B0000AZ9KS|1|What a piece of crap. I used this on my way to Sturgis.  The ratchet teeth it are rounded off and will not keep the bar extended.  I tried to return it, but I was on the road and 1 day past the return day (yesterday).  Sucks...  Do not buy, as the it may not hold your stuff in place.  For me, that was 2 propane tanks and 2 5 gallon gas cans.  Yeah, I don't need those bouncing around my truck bed.  I hesitated buying this the should have listened to my gut.
B00UUB4TS8|5|4 clamps for 8$?! That's cheaper than screw clamps! Used these for my 2002 Volvo s80 t6 twin turbo. Used them for the plastic tubing on top of the valve cover that leads to the turbos and the dual in/single out plastic tube coming from the turbos to the intercooler inlet pipe. No complaints, no corrosion. Will buy again when I need my other sizes.
B005N53C9I|4|These seat covers are nice quality and seem to be durable. However, my headrests are slightly too small for the cover. There is excess material bunched around the head rest.
B00D96TWC4|5|looks perfect on my camry!  I love the lil button covers for the screws.
B007369PNM|4|Great.
B006YU7G8E|5|Good Deal!
B00VVF69E4|3|I installed this on a twin turbo s80 running 16psi. It would not operate at all unless I cut a few coils off of the spring. Once I did that, fine tuning with the washers made it work as it should. Good product for a cheap price, just wish I didn't have to cut the spring down for it to work correctly.
B00S20958S|5|Great little product for me and my husbands anniversary. Arrived quickly as well!!! And looks to be made well!
B00JXOJVZO|5|Excellent!!! all going well, just right for the job. AAAAA+++++++++
B002MEJDKK|5|Very reasonable in price. Nearly perfect match for my truck. Bolted up with no problems.
B00ZC20NUS|5|This 9-in-1 Multipurpose Tool is not only a tire gauge to check the pressure in your tires (car, bicycle, motorbike, etc), it is a flashlight, seat belt cutter (in case of accident and being trapped inside a car), a sturdy window breaker again for escape purposes when trapped), saw, opener, Philips head screwdriver, flat head screwdriver – all those little emergency instruments you never can locate when you suddenly need them – in one smartly designed case. It gave me a very accurate tire pressure reading. The back-lit LCD display was easy to read. It is a great tool to have in your glove box or center console.
B000AY68SO|5|Plate was a gift and it did not disappoint.  The color has held up quite well over a year or so.
B004N026W8|5|Replaced the white shower fixtures with the brushed satin finish dura faucet to match the rest of the rv. Looks great & easy installation.
B000C42RWS|5|Perfect fit. Huge improvement in ride and handling. good price on mono tubes. I bought the rears as well.
B00AWNVVUI|5|look good and works good
B000P6CJ9O|5|Great for raising the height of the ball. I needed to get the shelf I put on my vehicle higher. Does the job well!
B00029KA6I|5|Works great.<br />Easy to use
B00CU5BLXS|1|My visor still falls down.
B002ZTNV8W|5|They work great.
B003SS0AEW|5|Looks great and came on time
B00P8AJX9G|5|Nice quality 8inch antenna. I would have to say that this antenna is much better quality than the American Muscle shorty antenna. The American Muscle shortly antenna only lasted me one season. This one lasted me a whole year and its still strong.
B00JGC54KE|5|This vest is great! I have been wearing it for about 2 weeks now and it is finally starting to break in. It will probably take a few more weeks though. I am an athletic 5' 11&#34; 185 lbs.  I was right on the border of small and medium and I ended up going with the medium.  Fits well all around, has tons of pockets. People say just two inside pockets but it has two but it actually has 8.  2 smaller pockets on either side that can store pens, knives or spare pistol magazines perfectly.  Also has two larger pockets; one the zips up and one that is open and it feeds from the top. I am very satisfied with this purchase! I considered returning it for a small but I wanted it for a large motorcycle ride that I had planned so I just kept it. I also was worried the small would be too small at the waist. Also, I was worried I couldn't fit a hoodie or sweater underneath the small.  The icing on the cake is that the price is unbeatable.
B00Q7B2SD8|5|Super fast shipping. I literally got it in like 2 days. It is fantastic. It has a deep throaty sound it's loud but not overly loud for a 250. it really does have simple installation, unless of course the stock exhaust gives you issues. Lol. I couldn't be happier with this exhaust. It looks amazing. It's a lot lighter than the stock as well. All around great product. Extremely fast shipping. Fantastic price.  Phenomenal seller. I couldn't be happier. *additional, I did a custom fairing kit and additonal mods on my bike. This exhuast was my first official mod, i attached an additional pic to show the bike at its finest with the exhuast :)))
B008SEBQ2G|1|I was tired of removing my factory antenna everytime I went to car wash.  Unfortunately the reception was compromised significantly when the stubby was installed.  Any other suggestions?
B001QIUGVI|5|Has been extremely vital to me in my automotive endeavors. I do all the repairs on my car and this device is important.<br /><br />Get the one with live data. It is worth it. More expensive but if I had not gotten the version with the live data I would not have realized that I was having an idle problem (Rpms are displayed).
B006JN3UWM|5|This is the most convenient way I have yet found to protect the inside of my Volvo S80 from summer sun. The magnet could be a bit stronger but it does its thing well and sits out of sight when not in use. Save your money on the roll-up and fold-up varieties. Just be careful when releasing the tension so it goes back to where it should.
B00JXEP6PS|1|Lightbar was not as described. I ordered 2 of these and 2 6&#34; single row light bars came.
B00HWI7FG0|5|Perfect fit for a 2013 cr-v ex-l
B0034ZUZM6|3|The first one I received had a bad motor that would barely turn. The replacement was quickly sent and works great.
B00MXBI32Q|4|I bought this for my 2014 Nissan Juke.  The floor mats are great, but the cargo mat is not at all the size of my car.  I think it is desinged for me to cut it, but who wants to do that?
B0024GQ1AG|5|Nice looking helmet. Fits great and well built!  Worth the money!
B0051UGL0M|5|Good Deal!
B009G4759U|5|EXCELLENT PURCHASE
B00V7T76QE|5|Great sticker for all those Godzilla fans out there who wanna show their love for the Big Guy. Great size and artwork.
B00PC0G07A|5|extremely snug fitting over the steering wheel. Sewing it on took some time but the look is well worth the effort. Comes with two needles and two spools of string but one is more than enough to make it all the way around.
B005ELY57E|1|This product differs from model to which is referred
B000F0Z81G|4|Looks good and it protects from dust and heat
B009OBVS20|4|Used in conjunction with Meguilar's G3500 Power System Tool. The pad does a good job of compounding at a gradual pace – my initial concern was that it might take off the finish at a rapid rate – and removes scratches, abrasions, white spots, etc. without leaving swirl marks. The compounding liquid container is quite small, but was enough for me to do work on two cars, with plenty left over. (I tried two other compounding products that I had on hand – one a liquid, one a paste ≠ and they seems to work just as well.) So while I may not have needed the Meguilar liquid, I found the pad alone to be well worth the money. A different, more abrasive pad might have damaged the finish. A less abrasive pad could have made the job interminable and not produced results as good as I got.
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Looks like it does a pretty solid job after a few days of use. It's not too much trouble to fold up, but can take a little while to get to to fit just right in your windshield. Definitely a good price especially if it lasts for years to come. I would recommend this to friends and family.
B002IZFSSO|4|works great, i recommend it.<br />shipped on time .<br />will continue using
B002EC9MFG|4|Fit tighter than a Felpro... but extreme caution of leaving out the sun too long, as the length will shrink and width sort of widen.
B006G2MJZU|4|Just as good as the OEM part. But when someone tries to use it as a step, it does turn out so well.
B000BOAZM8|4|great for a temporary fix
B005VHW3XY|4|Our problem with this battery was that it wasn't listed that you had to put the acid in yourself and that was not an easy task.  Some of the slots didn't open up and had to be forced open.  The battery works fine and was certainly delivered on time.  Just wish we had known about the acid.
B006HHRJFY|5|great for making your own brake lines
B001O7I20I|5|Good Deal!
B00020CATC|4|I think the Dynamat did help dampen vibrations and made an airtight seal against the speaker frame.
B00062YWLA|5|A perfect tach for older V-8 engines, looks right at home under the dash of my '77 F-100.  Don't need to read above 6k and don't need a huge dial as well.
B00JAMYDFC|5|303 products are great!
B000AS3D3S|5|The product arrived on time. Very satisfied with the order and product.
B00TEDAE28|5|Turns yucky looking leather goods into beauts!
B004R31W62|4|Out of the box worked very well ( read the instructions carefully). Took some time to adjust the way I wanted 2005 Rio 5. May make a slight adjustment but worked well as I installed from stock. Its been working solid for a month now.
B00KM9YSUW|4|My Volvo originally takes a 65.1mm bore wheel and I had to adapt a 74mm wheel on. Knowing I needed a hubcentric fitment, I purchased these. They do work well in centering the wheel but my stupid volvos hub on the vehicle is designed with a taper that when you install this ring, it remains loose. If the ring were about 1/4-1/2&#34; taller, it would be able to lock on to the 65.1mm hub bore. Made it work though. Good build quality, would buy these vs aluminum ones anyday. The aluminum ones WILL CORRODE laying against your steel hub. Don't be afraid of them melting. I put a ton of heat on these the first week I ran them on the car and they held up no question. It is a carbon composite material which has a VERY high melting point.
B006MX81FA|2|Front seat covers fit. The back seat covers did not fit, not even close. The fabric on top is fine, the fabric on the sides feel thin. I'm not sure how long they will last.
B000VL9WTS|3|I would have TOTALLY given this a 5 star review but one major thing which I was told would be a &#34;non-issue&#34; IS actually an issue.<br /><br />Starting with the pros:<br />The quality is impeccable.<br />Very durable material.<br />Fit is perfect<br />Straps really bring the whole thing together for a tight and super secure fit.<br /><br />The cons:<br />If you (like myself) leave your soft top attached, this will NOT work.  I was told by a rep at Quadratec that this is the ONLY top that will work with my soft top peeled back but its just not the case.<br />Other than that, the only other con is that I got my shorts dirty throwing this thing over my jeep on my tires.... :)<br /><br />The Pics:<br />I was able to stretch one side on and click into the rail system which the factory top uses, I was stoked!  Then walked over to the other side........here's the pics (soft top is under there, peeled all the way back).<br /><br />The last pic is after I took my soft top off.
B000S01VQY|2|Meter doesn't seem very reliable. Seems like you have to hold the rods just right for it to get a reading right. Even when they are touching directly on another. I would recommend a digital meter for next time
B001B5DO4C|5|Runs perfect on my 1997 prelude.  Feels just like oem.
B000IYPNC8|5|It works!
B003MRMSPS|5|Great product and great deal!
B00BQ0NSY8|1|Didn't work.went to start it Wires on ignition switch smoked
B004W6LF20|5|Great!!
B000NUCO4M|5|good!!
B00801RLUI|4|fit good , easy to replace
B004AIKY40|1|Purchased this as a replacement in hopes of correcting a random/intermittent &#34;no crank&#34; problem which is quite a common problem for early Chevy Impala owners.  After I installed this Dorman replacement switch I soon found I had a new intermittent problem, the cars engine would shut off while driving, it happened twice and I knew I had a serious and dangerous problem.  I troubleshot the problem back to this recently replaced Dorman.  This item is manufactured in China and is very poor quality.  The rear housing has just enough play to cause the rear contacts to break connection intermittently, and at least one connection shuts down the engine.  I don't think this is a defective item based on my disassembly and inspection, it's just a poorly manufactured product with loose tolerances.  Lesson learned for me, I will now buy the OEM AC DELCO part even though it is 2x the cost of this Dorman switch.
B00CLG2TCS|5|Relocated my license  plate bracket and this covered the holes perfectly.
B000C5I6H2|5|Fit my GMC perfectly.
B006QH552E|5|last one lasted me 11 years!! lets see how long this one can hold out
B004J0V948|5|Great fast and easy. Needed quick radiator to move. So far radiator is holding up like a champ.
B007240F66|5|fit perfict, looks good too!
B00EVQHM9G|5|Great kit I would buy again
B00CZDQU3G|5|Nice. It came out good.
B0002MA4T8|5|Perfect
B00BYNJALM|5|Great shock could tell the difference right away when I took off the Ranchos the truck came with better then new ride
B008SFAMX4|5|Fits well. Seems sturdy.
B00Q34AJ0S|4|Its nice. Its feels comfortable to touch and it allows me to steer the steering wheel without fear of losing the grip and crashing into something.
B00THRJVB6|5|Got this cover 171 inch to protect again the weather and to keep my 2015 Rav4 clean,does a great job made well and easy to put on fix good on my vehicle.
B000O1C47M|5|Great product
B004Z760ZS|3|I'm sure it's a great rotor but as I was sent two left front rotors instead of a left and a right who would know. They are grooved so directional and fit one side only. The fact I also ordered brake pads  should have been a clue I would have thought.
B003KS59WI|5|I gave it to my son for his car.  He likes it and it looks cool!
B004ZF3A94|5|I bought these to upgrade my lights on my 93 z28 an I must say that I don't even have to use my brights anymore these are very bright. It's a very simple install just plug an play I recommend this kit to all who needs better lighting at night
B007ZDG8K6|5|They r wonderful thanks
B00UY5NXGE|5|I bought it for my honey, he loves it ... they look awesome on his truck and it is so easy getting in and out the truck now... thanks
B007XE5LTG|5|Just got it. Used it the one time and works beautifully for my 97 ford. It's kinda cool to see all the real time data his thing can give you. Seems to be good quality. Better looking LCD screen than I expected. Also comes with a carrying case for unit, cables and manual.
B000Q6UEW2|5|Had hard times removing oil filter on my jetta mk5 with bare hands, rubber globes and several filters from walmart, didn't manage to change the filter until I bought this part. With this one and a rachet changing filter on jetta mk5 is a joke.
B00G258I0G|4|Opens nicely.  It is perfect for my class B motorhome.  My only complaint is the height adjustments are difficult.  Overall though, it is extremely sturdy and stable.
B00FOVMYN6|1|Receive product and it is not working
B00BSB2E7C|5|They were inexpensive, and got them installed, they fit and seem to work great.<br />What else is there. They didn't change my life, but, they just might save it.
B00348CWJM|5|Love this hippie looking stuff!! Ordered 4 diff ones & put on my garage door. Brighten things up. Looks real cool.
B00V9L2SZE|4|its ok
B00FISBZAI|5|After a stroke, my left hand and arm were not very &#34;flexible&#34;.  This extender made all the difference.  I am now able to buckle my seatbelt without attempted contorsions to reach the female link of the belt.
B00QI7FPM2|5|Got it for my 2012 Altima its fantastic only used 2 screws thanks for making such a great product.
B00QLTTN5M|3|For the money I have no complaints & i'm comparing them to eibach springs i have on my monte carlo that cost over twice as much. The top 3 coils in the rear could use a wrap around them due to the fact they stack on top of each other so on bumpy roads you'll get some clanking noises. I used some outdoor velcro wrap, the soft side & it solved that problem. The fronts will be very loose fitting when installing on the factory struts to the point that there's no need to compress to install them & then when the car goes on a lift or jack stand they have excessive play. When on the road not a bad ride, not to stiff or bouncy if u have upgraded swaybars. Custom sevice was very rough. I ordered them, got confirmation that they were shipped & was charged then got an email stating they were no longer available. This was after i was told they were shipped. After constant back & forth & finally getting a diff color that was avaliable they were finally shipped. No for the test of time & see how long they hold up. They are installed on kyb struts & shocks  ment for altered suspensions.
B003NBFMMY|4|Made it on a 14 hour round trip through the rain and hot weather and everything stayed dry, bag is HUGE and it's easiest to fill it with soft sided bags to stuff it full with no sharp corners.
B00HVI8S7Q|5|Like most of you, your keys have taken a beating. Both of the keyless remotes for my car have broken around where the keyring goes. Just slap one of these on it and you're good to go. No reason to buy a new Remote when you can get one of these for a fraction of the price.
B001PNEB2O|5|factory fit. good product
B00D9C2CDO|5|Drove from Florida to Oklahoma with this thing packed and had no tears I did use two extra cargo straps just for safety. But this thing was awesome and pretty big definitely waterproof also. Would definitely recommend
B00WQTW394|4|Bulky, but works great. Unfortunately they don't come with the harness connectors to ensure a secure connection. Beware if you have covers in the headlight assembly and you may not be able to put them back on and cause condensation inside the lense.
B001QFD83Y|5|Fast delivery, perfect fit
B000IYNVN6|5|Fits my 87 4.0 Cherokee with AW-4 FINE. Need to cut off the new connector, and splice in you old connector. Easy. Fan is well made, mfg in Taiwan, not Chicom. Pulls more air and is quieter than the old 6 blade fan.
B001GEYXPW|5|quality mount havent installed ye let you know how it goes
B00W48WUE0|5|eye catcher. love it
B00US6BXA2|5|4 Ultrasonic Car Deer Warning Whistles 2 Packs...<br />ATB ..as advertised...swear by them!
B00MOKM53O|4|These sat in the box for a few days while I tried to determine how much time to devote to the installation. I checked YouTube for any helpful videos, but only found one video for this brand installed on a Ford F150......not all that helpful for my situation. Decided to tackle the job after dinner in the sweltering heat of the Florida summer evening. Set up a fan, got out the socket wrenches, and went to work. Turned out to be easier than I had imagined it would be.  The directions were adequate.....barely. My 2009 Silverado 4x4 rides a bit high, so looking at the underside was easy enough. Although the mounting brackets are stamped, I matched each one with the directions and painted them with white lettering (RT FRT, LFT REAR, etc), laid them on the driveway under the appropriate mounting point, and got busy. While the directions indicate to begin on the passenger side, I ran into a glitch with the body mounts there (one was bent inwards preventing the mounting bracket from seating correctly - an issue not of the manufacturer's making - I'll address that tomorrow). I tightened everything back up and moved to the driver's side.  Edit To Add : The brackets that attach to the body mounts *will* make a popping noise at low speeds over small bumps as they hit against the body mounts that are welded onto the frame. Took the truck by the local dealership and talked to their body shop man, and he tells me it's a common malady due to the location of the mounting point. GM steps mount differently, and they get no complaints. Aftermarket stuff, not so much. The cure ? Went to Home Debit, got some big 5/8&#34; washers and a few thin neoprene washers to make a home-brew spacer - just enough to put a 1/4&#34; or so between the body mount &#34;biscuits&#34; and the supplied brackets for these steps. Time will tell if my cure works or not. Your mileage may vary. Just be aware that this might become an issue after the install is complete.  By now, I had a pretty good idea how this was supposed to go. Loosen body mount bolts, slide on bracket, tighten bolt part way. Once both brackets were loosely installed on the driver's side, I propped the pretty chrome bar up with a piece of foam packing from the box to hold it in position as I screwed in the bolts that hold the bar to the brackets. While it might be helpful to have another pair of hands for that part of the install, it is certainly not necessary. Once the bolts and washers went into the bar, everything went quickly. Double checked the positioning of the brackets and the bar, tightened it all up, sat back and admired my new chrome step.....took all of about 15 minutes for one side.  The quality seems good, the fit and finish are just fine for my needs. The price was right, with free shipping, and it's a pretty easy DIY install....even at night, with only a pocket flashlight and a few hand tools. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the directions. If you're at all handy with a wrench, you can install these easily without a hoist or even a jack. GET SOME !
B00032K546|1|These did not fit on my 2013 Ford Fusion.
B012X49ENY|5|Before I decided to order this Wingbag, my handbag always failed forward on the car floor from a passenger seat when I hit the brake immediately. Now, my problem is already solved by Wingback. The Wingback is the perfect solution to keep my handbag from falling on the car floor. It's also the best place to store my other small items such as kindle, smart phone, hand cream and makeup bag. It's very convenient for me to reach. Everything stays in its place. My handbag and kindle are no longer on the dirty car floor.<br />I'm very happy with the material quality and craftsmanship. It's quite gorgeous and well design. It made from high standard leather, mesh and buckles. It looks classy and absolutely beautiful. I have been getting many compliments form my friends. Totally exceeds my expectations!
B00KTJ1YWU|4|This remote head key replaces one that was returned for refund,  The reason for return was the two halves of the head would not stay snapped together when turning key on or off.  Another problem was lettering on buttons was wearing off after 5 months.  I've had this key for such a short time it's hard to tell if it will perform well.I will follow up with an addition to this review in about 6 months.  I am, however, satisfied with vendor's service.
B004OXK7T8|5|great
B00V7COU9W|5|Love these foglights!!!! Easy to install if u have common sense haha
B000765E08|5|excellent all the way. perfect
B00EFGHF44|5|Looks great on the Mercedes. The logo is a sticker but it looks seemless. Since I have been reading other people saying that these peel after car washes, I'm going to cover up this area with some plastic before washing. I'll be washing my car by hand. No way this baby is going through an automatic.   So far the plate looks nice. No quality issues. I did not put on the silver bolt covers since I used different bolts . These covers don't fit on them. If the sticker starts to peel, I will update my review.   For now it looks great!
B000VWK4UI|5|I've actually have had this cover for three years now. And it has bailed me out plenty of times. It's not perfect but it does the job. The only complaint I have is it fills up with water and sags around the roll bars. Not a big deal though not much you can do about that. I do recommend you Scotchgard the covet at some point as when water sits to long it will slowly start dripping through. When I say slowly drip through its exactly that. I did have one buckle break (was my fault) but was easily able to fix myself. All the saps are holding up good with no issues. I use this covet everyday in the summer because I'm lazy and don't like putting my soft top back on till fall.
B000Q0R4QC|4|As others have stated, you will need to order two sets to do a complete head gasket job. There are varying opinions on whether you need to replace them. I chose to replace them. There were a couple pitted spots that i felt were no longer safe. If anything, more piece of mind. Not ridiculously expensive, perfect oem fit, and used the same 12 point socket as what came off. Hopefully they never have to be removed again.
B00CPACPVA|5|I'm ready to roll with my new gloves there so cute!
B004I1CVI6|1|Item received was not as described and as pictured online.  Had already been returned by another customer for the same reason!
B00HCVRPY4|4|Nice for the price.
B00A740VQM|3|It does its job, but you can tell it was very cheaply made. Arrived with a piece of the opening mechanism broken, so now the little button that is made to open it doesn't work or keep it closed.
B00BOFDSY0|3|I need the brackets to mount these lights because the factory one was rusted. I feel they should come with a bracket
B00UKG1X14|4|It's really nice I have a Kia Sorento the front seat covers its a little tide but it fit almost right the back cover it's fine it have enough space
B00SEMFVBO|5|Awesome - perfect fit - so helpful to have
B000CO86EG|5|I have used these four jacks for several days raising an old 12' x 12' shed up for rolling it to a new location. Slow but it works. Other option $1,000 to have moved 10'. Oh jack rental here in Sterling, AK is $16 ea per day, so you do the math on 4 jacks overal serveral days.
B007KFO982|4|It's good but not exactly 5 stars. It doesn't cover 100% of the windshield as shown in the picture. It covers about 95% with the visors down. Other than that I love it. It keeps the front seats cool from the sun.
B002VPA5IY|5|Great product worked as intended
B004RCSM98|5|Quick shipping and live product.
B0068ERZUA|5|Awesome product.  Less cushion than expected, but performs well.  Can feel the air flow.
B003TSRZC6|1|Northern tools has it for 7.00
B0012PNSO2|5|EXCELENTES
B000F34LZW|5|Items shipped on time and was as described. Great customer service. Great product. Highly recommend this.
B008HCV7VE|5|Doesn't really secure well.
B00OVB7LGA|5|Light weight but durable material, easy to cut.  Fit my 2007 Chevy Cobalt like a glove.
B007L2JNJ4|5|I couldn't ask for a better fit. They don't wiggle and flop like the strap type and no worrying about hardware to keep them tight like the slip on type. I would recommend the Fit System mirrors to anyone on a budget and not wanting those big gaudy tow mirrors that get smacked and broken anyway.
B000CNGVAS|5|Excellent product. Great price, how can you go wrong at $4.99 and free shipping. I just paid twice that amount for one at Harbor Freight a week before. I had to buy bolts, but I did on the one from Harbor Freight also due to it coming with the wrong size needed. Real easy install on my Wrangler TJ.
B007L8X1X2|5|Expensive but good quality
B00J1U3AVG|5|Perfect fit, cool mesh for warm days.
B00J09FONU|5|2000 tundra works well, 10,000 miles out.
B00C306H0W|5|Great value on these footpegs.  I had previously been running the factory rubber footpegs on my KLR650.  I can't begin to count the times that my foot was wet (or covered with silicone from work) and I slipped off the peg while mounting the bike and scraped my shin.  Not any more, these pegs have eliminated that problem.  I can't comment on the off road ability of the pegs.  I have not had the bike off road since the installation but i'll bet that they are leaps and bounds above the stock pegs.<br /><br />I also ordered the Moose Racing footpeg springs from Motorcycle Superstore. I could not find the springs for sale on Amazon.
B003FO2O1G|2|I purchased one for my RV and was very dis-satisfied with it. I am only able to get one station at home and am only 20 miles from the TV station. I put the original one back on and can get 26 stations. I will keep the original one. It was not a good purchase. I wasted money and time trying to get it to work. Unfortunately missed the deadline to return it so now I am even more disappointed. It simply didn't work and congrats to those that got one that did work.
B00CZG1ZRY|2|Bought this and mounted it on my front windshield.  Within 2 months (Springtime, not summer) the suction cup holes deformed to the point that the back of the suction cups pulled right through.  Was cheap enough that it wasn't worth contacting the vendor for a replacement.
B0006FK7YS|2|I bought one of these mops for a job I had and loved it. I decided to by one for home and purchases one that was about 15 dollars less. Big mistake. The head is flopping and flips over, the pads do not fit the size of the head and the first time I peeled the pad off the mop head the velcro came lose. You get what you pay for.
B001IZIFQC|5|This cover looks and feels thick and durable, not like the ADCO Model 22893 cover, which sides tear and puncture easily. The elastic with the bendable ends works perfectly and simple.<br />It fit my 2008 Fleetwood Victory 3959 Pup Up perfectly, it is long enough to cover up to and including trailer hitch coupler!
B0002UHVJG|5|Super easy to replace.  The old one was broken and the antenna on the RV wouldn't go up.  Now we can get that antenna in the sky and watch the news while camping!  Great price as well!
B00HJ6Q9KS|5|A+ seller. Item just as described.
B004FPABG4|5|Absolutely love this sticker. I got it for my dad after his first half ironman a few years ago and he loves it. This past week I did my own half Ironman and had to get the sticker! I love that it is the Ironman logo with the 70.3 written in it! And it really stands out on your car.
B000HBNTX2|5|An old stamdby
B00A161T3A|5|was able to use in the rickey bobby dodge last week car is faster.
B00651C998|2|It fits fine, but after one rain storm..the screw that connects the antenna to truck is completely rusted. Cheap.
B00CPL8OVE|5|I have used this in the past. It does wonders for my old diesel.
B000AM8BF4|1|Bought this in July, used it one or two times and already, it does not work.
B0027XEKQ8|4|good but no mounting screws
B001MOVJJE|4|I initially ordered the wrong power window switch.  Switch Doctor was very good about exchanging the switch and making sure that I got the right one.  The installation for fairly straight forward, even though it was something I have never done before.  Very pleased with the product and the customer service.
B0002JMEQW|5|Does as it states in the description.
B00E1ORIAQ|4|It's nice and all, but it looks more 3D in the picture. In real life it's quite flat and less sharp looking. From a distance it still looks interesting. Good for that outfit with a little techy flair.
B00L7R5AGY|2|Was disappointed wasn't the one I wanted had a skull design not just a solid blue and black
B00NBN1C78|4|Got this for my father who just got a big boat. Even nice boat trailers often don't come with jack or the tools you'd need to change a tire. It's hard to review something you hope you never have to use. I've read some complaints about rust after use, but again--hoping that this comes into play only for emergencies anyway.
B00QVP9KY0|5|great service by Apex
B00RW4N2JI|5|Good products fast shipping thanks
B00KTIYXLU|5|Worked perfect!
B004A2D4N4|5|This has been the perfect replacement. No more knocking! It was easy to replace.
B00122EENE|5|I was very pleased with this product.  As soon as I replaced it the problem never came back.  There is no need to buy this at auto zone for up to $300.00.  Buy from Amazon!!!
B00PX1OWA0|3|These are really small and I probably missed it in the description but for a lawn mower or a small trailer not for the travel trailer in which they were bought.  Atleast they were cheap!
B000HRX1JS|5|This piece of bike luggage is exactly what I needed for my Harley Davidson soft tail duece.I was able to put my textile jacket leather,vest,two pairs of gloves and two pairs of glasses in the main area alone and plenty of odds and ends in the other many storage areas.it will stay on my bike from now on it solved my storage issue perfectly.
B00JSJMUBQ|5|We had a hard time finding a steering wheel cover to fit my boyfriends '04 Acura RSX because the steering wheel is smaller than the average sized one.  We could never find one in stores that fit and they were all too big, but this one worked perfectly!  I ordered the small size for him and he struggled a little bit to get it on the steering wheel.  It took some muscle, but once he got it on it was the perfect fit.  It provides a nice snug fit and he absolutely loves it!
B000E7YP82|5|Great for the Subura Outback.  We love it.  Fits a double stroller and all our luggage.
B007XZK6UE|5|It looks amazing
B00KLKW5Z2|5|This carb looks great haven't installed it yet hope it will work as good as it looks very nice product
B001O7PNW8|5|Used m105 and m205 on G35 with PC DA polisher. Be sure to remove splatter immediately or it will be hard to remove. Cover anything that you don't want splatter on. Gave my car a great finish!
B00063073Q|5|This coil is the perfect fit for my 1998 Cherokee Laredo, but is necessary to buy an extra adapter cable to plug it in the original wiring. It works fine, I have been using it for week.
B00IGNPDZK|4|The product was as described but I just wish the lights were a little bit brighter
B00594OIWS|5|Fits like a glove.
B004J3A9A0|1|Kit came with everything thing I needed. Needle was flawless. Everything functioned properly and my trx400 now runs like a dream
B00T2GT9L4|4|I received it earlier than expected, and it seems to work just fine
B00435MNGM|5|I've been waxing cars on a regular basis for 24 years and this is the best 1 step, inexpensive wax I've ever used....
B001JK44LG|5|Works Killer
B0009IK9E0|5|It works fine
B00J4PJ3HS|5|Well  manufactured. Fit perfectly.
B00OQUJ6NC|3|I've had these lights for about 6 months now. One of them is already out. I've ordered another set... maybe I made a mistake with ordering the same one but I'll give it a try, since I like the color of the light. I'll let you know if they burn quick...   I don't think you'll find better white than this. Fits good, looks good. Installed on a 2006 330xi.
B006ZBABT8|4|perfec
B00UGRF3MM|5|Nice
B000CPAVCA|3|Paint didn't shine like the reviews said it was supposed to. I put 5 layers on and it was a gloss black for like a week then it faded into a matte black. It looks alright and it's easy to use, but this isn't exactly what I wanted it to look like.
B004X96ECW|2|The tip and the brush are useless
B001KXIHFG|5|Perfect Grease for motorcycle recommended by experienced mechanic or motorcyclist.<br />Stop using 4WD or lithium grease on your motorcycle chain. This grease works well on the chain of garage motor.
B00XF6R464|5|Perfect
B000JFJLP6|4|Great product. Fast shipping. Just wish it came with a charger.
B000COA1ZI|5|One of our factory original flares had been damaged so we went for these Bushwacker replacements to dress up our 14 year old truck.  They were easy to install and look great--my son even said he thought they looked better than the original flares.
B00WDWAKTE|1|Poorly
B000CLQIVC|4|Sorry I gave it 5 stars but this kit was supplied by mistake - not for my vehicle - - but it looked at least 4 stars to me!
B00CYLKBUM|5|Bought it for my Husband, and he LOVES it
B000C11PYW|5|I had huge doubts about this stuff. But having used it on two car tires and most recently on my lawn tractor tire (completely flat and came off wheel), I am sold on it. I was scared to drive my car after using this Slime because I didn't trust it one bit. However, the car tires I used it on held air better after using this stuff than the other tires that had no leakage issues...seriously. I drove on those Slime filled tires for a year with no issues. My lawn tractor tire was completely flat and rolled off the wheel. I looked on Youtube to find information on how to get a tire back on a wheel and get it to seal again. I followed the directions on the video and it worked for the most part, but I couldn't get the tire to seal completely (was leaking at stem and several places around wheel). As a last resort (should have been my first), I added Slime. It took a few hours of frequent spinning of the wheel to spread the Slime around (I almost gave up and ordered a new tire), but it finally stopped leaking and sealed. That was 3 months ago, still fully inflated, and I have not needed to add any air...seriously amazing stuff.  UPDATE: 1 year later: tractor tire is still fully inflated (no additional air has been added since adding Slime).
B00510GGNY|1|These do not stay on the mirror - as soon as u put them on the elastic is gone
B000C93DRG|5|Fit perfectly better quality than original.
B001H2PRD0|5|This was was perfect.  I was very leary to buy something like this off the net.  But Amazon as always delivered and met my expectations.
B00K56PPAY|2|does not actually fit my windshield that well, too small. When it gets hot out it gets rather flimsy and falls down
B00V7AVUBA|5|They fit Perfectly on my 2012 crewmax Tundra! It took about an hour to install and it was Quick and painless and my Girlfriend who is vertically challenged really appreciates them!! I had a little trouble with what side the brackets went on but my girlfriend being a collage grad and all looked at it and straitened me out strait away! I think they make my Toyota look classy but be careful when getting out of your truck on a HOT day the aircraft aluminum will burn your leg if it touches it just like a pipe on the side of your Harley will!! OUCH THATS HOT!!!!!
B000BOA0BY|5|Excellent packaging,delivered perfectly on time, and exactly as advertised! I highly recommend.
B00FH3YB5K|4|My purse no longer falls in the back seat. The plastic string pulls get stuck under the arm rest sometimes making it hard to close after being opened.
B007HGE2JU|5|Great Product.  Follow the directions for install and everything assembled great.
B003B9HKZA|5|Excellent!
B006B376WK|5|This duster replaces all other sprays, cloths etc. Makes the job of dusting not such a bad job. Dust actually clings to it instead of just getting shuffled. Love it
B002ZS4QCS|4|These hold 4 canvas bags for me. One of the rubber tips came off after using for a couple of months.
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Its a solid plastic kickstand pad.  Does what you need it to do.  Great product.
B004UCFBL2|5|Ok
B00KWNULFO|5|I've had this cover for a month now and so far it's great.  I've taken it on a few road trips, including to a very hot dry climate as well as through rain storms.  The cover has held up well and very little, if any, water has made it's way inside.  On one road trip the speed limit was 80 and I probably averaged 85 mph with no issues to the cover.  I've been very happy with this purchase.
B00COBW934|5|seller was so helpful. product works great !!!!

B000DINKPQ|5|Get with the 72102 for that classic 1960's land yacht sound.
B00RCBERJK|5|Perfect on my F150 along with the Novita EP27 Flasher relay.
B00LEBLI82|5|liked the first batch so much, i ordered a second batch and changed out every light in my toy hauler except the outdoor patio lights. They are not quite as bright but i noticed they draw about 1/8 the power the incondesents do. not as hot and maybe its just me but didnt seem to attract bugs as much??
B00757KJTI|2|Looks great on my 2015 Tundra but reception on local stations was reduced quite a bit. HD stations reception was totally lost.
B001AW2ARS|5|love it
B00FXLJ8U4|5|I haven't had to use it yet, but my nieces could have used it when they found themselves upside down in their car in a creek!  They couldn't get the door open or their seat belts off.  Now they will each have one for their cars.
B004HPSI6M|1|They were not compatible, they were just any ordinary charger and I was very disappointed
B00EQ2Z8XW|5|It's a good product, just like I think
B009FUF6DM|1|These are very cheaply made. They are thin compared to other microfiber cloth products on the market. I would never buy these again.
B000CLV3QW|5|Perfect fit fo 05 Ram Hemi 4x4  QC. Nothing else to say. Works great!
B00GLZPDQY|5|Love it..you have tobe careful on the sizing tho ,made sure everyone take a look at thr sizing charts
B00KTIXGLI|5|Amazingly bright on F150 third light. Way better than the cheap plastic alternatives LEDS.
B00D44SZ42|1|Bad part did not put out enough pressure to the engine ended up having to pay a shop to re-replace the pump
B0073WEZU4|2|Looks great. Radio reception sucks though
B00F8LEB9W|5|Was very happy to get the three button replacement remote in such a short  time after I ordered it.

B00MQ18FX0|5|Excellent
B00NZU0AYI|5|Love these switches.  I have 5 of these in my truck for light bar.  Rear lights.  Train horn.  And compressor.  Out of all of them. Only one has a loose connection. And the top part doesn't fully light up on the rocker hand switch emblem.  I just gonna  reorder that Switch .  All in all. They light up great.  Have a great click to them.  I also order the plastic housing that they sit in for a more secure and better look.  Very very happy with them  Update : STV emailed me and without asking!!!!! they sent me a free &#34;rocker hand &#34; switch to replace the half lit one.     I was already happy with all my 5 switches.   Great company.  Great great customer service.   Highly recommended.    Thank you STV motorsports !
B008DRJA30|5|Fit and work great
