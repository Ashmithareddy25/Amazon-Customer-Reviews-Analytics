0316779237|4.0|This is over the top and under the edge and into your face type humor. I didn't sense a single misstep: David Sedaris is a writer's writer.  As a humorist, you, the reader, must decide if his style appeals to you.  I know some people who would be horrified by this book. But I liked it.<br />I did not, however, LOVE it. I respect good writing to the utmost.  You get that here.  I respect an author who has control over his stories in every aspect.  You get that, too. I love humor more than anything, but...but...but I couldn't get around the fact that there was NOTHING nice in this book.  I mean, zero.  I  honestly feel that as humans we have SOME redeeming qualities,and I know he was kidding, but it was kind of creepy.<br />David Sedaris is really, really good at what he does.  In fact, there is no one out there who can top him at this.  So go ahead and get this book if you like, but don't expect me to say &quot;I laughed out loud through the whole thing&quot; or &quot;I laughed so hard the tears were falling down my face&quot; because, for me, that wasn't the case.  Four stars for top quality writing from a top quality writer.  One star missing for humanity.<br />best,  jean
0684853523|5.0|I didn't know very much about Stephen King before, but after reading On Writing, I feel as though he could be a neighbor, a coworker, or someone I run into every week. Mr. King takes us into his world and shows us what guides his writing and how he makes it happen. He is funny, informative, and fascinating. <br />Thank you again, Stephen, and keep up the good work.
B000007QQQ|5.0|This is one of the BEST early-70s singer-songwriter albums, or of any era for that matter. It is filled with soothing and moving songs that should really be better known to fans of James Taylor, Carole King, Jackson Browne et. al. It enhances that style with an added layer of English/Scottish mystical folk, with a nod to blues. Actually, the best comparison may be to Joni Mitchell. Martyn is a songwriter of rare sensitivity and flexibility, and this wonderful album, heard at the right time and in the right mood, is virtually guaranteed to infiltrate your subconscious and have you reaching for it again and again, especially on Sunday mornings over a cup of coffee. It's diverse, too: he throws in a Stonesy rocker here, an extended instrumental there (what a great guitarist!), but the ten tracks hang together perfectly. &quot;Head And Heart,&quot; &quot;Bless The Weather,&quot; &quot;Just Now,&quot; &quot;Let The Good Things Come&quot;...so many gems here! This and &quot;Solid Air&quot; are his two best albums by a mile (&quot;Inside Out&quot; isn't too far behind), but Martyn's body of work overall is admirable and worthy of the sort of wider attention currently being afforded his late friend, labelmate and colleague Nick Drake. After hearing this stroke of pastoral genius, I'm sure you'll feel the same.
0448060191|5.0|If you've never read this book, you simply have to! Women of all ages can and will relate to the follies of the little women. From burnt hair to boy troubles to feeling stupid and made into a fool, we've all been there and experienced it in some form or another. My favorite chapter is actually the first one (Though I can recite any passage from any chapter of the book word for word.) A Merry Christmas introduces us to the characters and show the unity and support in American families during the Civil War. Dark Days has you feeling the worst is around the corner, but then some sun peeks through the ice encrusted tree limbs. And though The Valley of Shadow brings about darker days yet, good things come of them, and in the end, life is beautiful! It doesn't matter what your usual style of reading material is, this is by far the greatest work ever published. I have this particular copy and there are about four or five exquisite full color drawings inside and some truly magnificent sketches, aslo. Don't even consider waiting one more second to pick this one up, whether you're a long time fan who's been looking for the perfect copy or a new reader, trust me when I say you will want this one longer than any library in the country will allow it out. Enjoy!
B00004XOWM|4.0|The whole idea of combing rap and rock sounds ingenious and even challenging, but through the eyes of Limp Bizkit it looks hilariously easy.  On Chocolate Starfish, nothing has changed.  You'll still find an intense set of thematic sounds geered toward piledriver guitars, funky hip-hop beats, and the lethal rhymes of Fred Durst, filled to the teeth with swear words and slang street terms.  However, the new use of bigger terminology and better songwriting is present, especially in the midst of track 4 My Way, and Take a Look Around, the Mission Impossible II theme that shines with the guitar work of Wes Borland.  Starfish is only further proof that Limp Bizkit contain the most underated musicians in the industry, not because the musical works of the album are spectacularly complicated, but because the sound is subtle but challenging in it's own simple rythym.  Durst looks to play mind games on the opening song after the strange intro by what sounds like a crack-fed alien being from another demension reinforming fans that &quot;Limp Bizkit is in the house.&quot;  In Hot Dog, the f word appears in every sentence of the teleptical freestyle and gives Slipknot a frightening run for obscene use of language in songwriting.  Perhaps the best effort of the album is the acoustically arranged duet between Scott Weiland and Durst, Hold On, which surprisingly enough reminisks old folkish lore present in the stream of Simon and Garfunkel.  Rollin' (air raid vehicle), My Generation, and It'll Be OK, are classic examples of the fine tuned mosh-music that Limp Bizkit excell at.  There's plenty of licks, bass struts, vocal mixing, and noise to go around, and plenty of moments that will get the bodies banging and flying.  Once again Limp Bizkit rise above the hum of the rap-metal scene, and though their mere concept is a childish way of thought, it is still technologically exciting, and dares to overthrow the annoying reign of pop music.  The production is outstanding, giving Durst'ssometimes pitiful vocal attempts a large boost in quality, and amplifying the sound of anger in an abruptly dark environment.  Limp Bizkit aren't going to last forever- true.  Limp Bizkit will become a passing fad of the rock fashion conglomeration- possibly true.  Of course the pleading of Nookie and Generation X won't carry on forever, but while it lasts, it would be a sin not to take it in with open arms.  Prepare your ears for another glorious shock-therapy session, this time engulfing a new edge that will add an extra bonus to the bleeding at loud volumes.  Take it from Wes Borland, &quot;if you didn't like Limp Bizkit before, then you're definitely not going to like Limp Bizkit now&quot;, in fact you'll hate Limp Bizkit.  Still, those ringing true to the quintet will be pleased, grateful, and once again satisfied with another helping of rap-rock nostalgia masters Limp Bizkit.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Limp Bizkit has followed up their great sophomore CD (Significant Other) with a worthy 3rd CD from the group. This CD does has some very good tracks, such as Rollin, Hot Dog, and Take A Look Around (Theme from MI:2), but there are many tracks I just don't like. But this CD is still very good, and worth buying. I was just hoping for a little something more.
B00003CX7L|5.0|I thought &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; being a sequel was going to be boring and not worth buying.  Boy was I wrong!  This was just as good if not better than the original.  As always the graphics were great and the plot was better then I expected.  I was totally caught up in this movie right along with my 4 year old.  Cant wait to watch it again!  &quot;If you dont have one, GET one&quot;.
B000002GJS|5.0|I'll confess that I haven't heard any of his new stuff, but, of the albums I own (specifically, his four previous to this one), I listen to this one the most.  It seems a lot more mature than his previous albums, music-wise.  The guitars seem less rough and the vocals seem to blend a lot better with the music.  This could be a production trick, but it's still true of the album.<br />There are so many good songs on this album, it's hard to know where to start.  There are rockers like IS YOUR MAMA GONNA MISS YA?, HOUSE ARREST, ALL I WANT IS YOU, and DON'T DROP THAT BOMB ON ME.  All of these songs are great to listen to...pure rock 'n' roll fun.  Then there are the ballads...THOUGHT I'D DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN, DO I HAVE TO SAY THE WORDS, and (EVERYTHING I DO) I DO FOR YOU.  All of these songs are heartfelt and emotional.  They are well written, both lyrically and musically.  The way the two types of songs are interwoven with each other makes this a really strong album.  Most rock 'n' roll albums only have one ballad on them.  This one has three, not to mention the fact that ALL I WANT IS YOU is thematically a ballad, but musically a rocker.  This album was put together brilliantly with changes in tempo in all the right places.<br />If you're looking for a good Bryan Adams' album to start with or just a good rock 'n' roll album in general, this is a sure bet.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This girl got it goin' on! Not only has her mpost famous love song from this album been anti-love, she has a song on here not about guys at all, called &quot;Lucky&quot; it is perhaps her best pop song. In it, she describes a fictitious movie star who. though everyone thinks she's lucky, she cries all alone. Brit sounds really good and her voice is very sympathetic, you can feel Lucky's misery here. Ooops! I Did It Again is talks about misleading a guy into believing she's in love with him. I like the part where she says &quot;Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways.&quot; Oooops!! That was mean, bad Hoku! It is actually an excellent song you HAVE to hear at least once. I think once you do, you'll be hooked for life. My fave song here is &quot;Stronger&quot; (The video debuts the 23rd for those of you who don't know.) Britney proves she doesn't need a man in this one (finally!) but she tries to copy Christina Aguilera a little at the beginning and it just doesn't sound right when you can't sing. Ooops! I did it again! I like the actual music here. It has that 80s sound. I don't want to say big band, because it's not, but it's more guitar and less drums than most of her songs. I also like &quot;What U See&quot; because Britney tells a guy that she's not going to change just because she's dating him now. If he doesn't like her tight dresses and makeup, he can get lost. I think it's great she's finally getting away from bubblegum and the miserable love-lost lyrics that usually go along with Britney tunes. This is MUCH better then Baby...One More Time and has a better message for girls. Be your own person, men are all pigs, and play with them a little bit when you can, not the other way around. Don't wait another second to try this out, I think you'll really like it.
B000000WCV|5.0|I had never been a fan of dance music until I heard Daft Punk some four years ago. Changed my life, from a dour indie rocker to a cheerful (I think?) house junkie. I remember hearing Da Funk on KROQ in LA and having my head absolutely explode on Ventura Boulevard. <br />While the album is in truth a bit uneven (the first half is a bit more enjoyable than the second, imho), at their best Daft Punk has no peer. Basement Jaxx, Cassius, Armand... They're all quite good, but none quite equals the sheer ingenuity of Thomas and Guy-Man.<br />I cannot recommend this album enough. It remains the finest dance album in my collection, if not the finest album period. The only thing that would've made it better is if they included the song &quot;Musique&quot;, their... vocoder, filtery-house track on the Wipeout XL soundtrack.
B00004XOWM|5.0|THIS CD ROCKS, the way they mix rap and rock is SO TIGHT i think this cd is better than the last one, it also features DMX,METHOD MAN, and REDMAN, and there is a phat track wit X-ZIBIT ,all da songs  ARE TIGHTcd I must warn you parents out there, The language is extremely strong. ... Overall, a true Limp Bizkit fan wouldn't miss this relese for the world.
B00004XOWM|4.0|I listen to everything from rap to country to classical and i know whats good. This is good. Limp has made another album that will sour them into the spotlight. Songs like &quot;Rollin&quot; and &quot;My Generation&quot; will run MTV and VH1 for the next several months. And to keep the audience listening, Limp adds in a remix of &quot;Rollin&quot; with Method Man and DMX. They are no longer in my opinion a one hit wonder or a 2 album wonder...this cd is putting them on the map as one of the newest up coming sensations that will people will listen to generations to come.
068484267X|5.0|This book is funny from beginning to end and makes you appreciate what you've got. I've never read of such destitute poverty before, but still laughed all the way through, which is a testament to McCourt's writing. His writing makes you see how ridiculous the adult world looks through the eyes of a child just trying to survive the his alcoholic father, Catholic school and the God-awful Irish weather!
B00004XONN|5.0|In the broad continuum of post-postmodernity, there arrives an album brutally Steve Reich-esque mingled with a dash of &quot;Minuet for Clarinet and Sledgehammer.&quot;  I listened to this album and got so excited...I left a load in me draws.  Thank you, Thom.
B00004X01U|4.0|This is no Ray of Light which I think is her best to date.  Music, however, is different and I like it a lot.  It is not what I expected though.  I was expecting her to stay on the &quot;spiritual&quot; path she has been on especially while being pregnant again during the making of this album.  It was surprising and I had to listen a couple times for it to sink in, but it did and I recommend it.  If you are a Madonna fan you will surely enjoy this CD.

0399146253|2.0|I am, for lack of a better adjective, a Cornwell &quot;nut&quot; having read all of her Kay Scarpetta books. The main flaw in her latest creation is....confusion.  Let's be honest - we read her forensic treasures for the mystery, intrigue and &quot;page-turning&quot; suspense! However, if there are (IF THIS IS INDEED POSSIBLE) too many twists and turns we lose track of her ingenuity - forced to sort through endless facts thrown in the &quot;mix&quot; rather than relish  her tempting forensic tale. Another problem was how &quot;slow&quot; the beginning seemed with much talk about Kay's instability and psychological health after her brush with (at the end of &quot;Black Notice&quot;) Chandonne.<br />There is also, unlike her other Scarpetta masterpieces, no finality to the story.  She, quite obviously,leaves us &quot;hanging&quot; (HOPEFULLY only 'til her next Scarpetta outing)- with a sloppy summation that, I feel, short-changes the reader!!!  <br />LONG LIVE KAY SCARPETTA!!!
0553278355|5.0|What a wonderful insight into the mind of someone who is tortured by depression. Plath does a good job of helping you to empathize with the main character so much that it makes you wonder if you could end up in the same state, which emphasizes the insidiousness of mental illness. This book made me almost cry just because of the beautiful way she describes her pain and feelings of isolation.
0876855575|5.0|First I wanted to know why he called it &quot;Ham on Rye&quot;. <br />I mean, I know that ham on rye is a sandwich but I figured that Henry Chinaski liked a drink and Henry Chinaski is Bukowski's &quot;literary alter-ego&quot; - which means Chinaski is Bukowski - and Bukowski was an alcoholic and alcoholics aren't that crazy about food (because, hey, why eat when you can drink?) so maybe it didn't mean sandwich. <br />I looked up the two words in a dictionary. Aside from the filling for a sandwich, ham is also the back of a pig. Rye can mean gentleman  (from the Romany word &quot;rai&quot;), or king (from the Sanskrit &quot;rajan&quot;). I felt clever then. &quot;Ham on Rye&quot;? King Pig. Gentleman Pig. That sort of makes sense. I like that. I didn't stop there, though. Rye is also a kind of grass used in the manufacture of whisky. Here we go, I thought. Whisky. That's more like it. Ham, too. Like Radio Ham. An actor who relies on stock phrases and gestures. An actor. Somebody who acts. A phoney. A phoney on whisky. That didn't make sense so much. Not the phoney part at any rate. <br />Thinking about phoney did the trick, though. Phoney = Holden Caulfield = &quot;Catcher in the Rye.&quot; <br />&quot;Ham on Rye&quot; and &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;. Both of them adolescent rites of passage. Sort of. <br />Got me thinking. It's been at least ten years since I read &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, so forgive me, but - if I remember correctly - catcher in the rye was Holden Caulfield's ideal job. The rye field on the edge of a cliff. Children playing, running through the rye. Holden there, at the edge of the rye and the cliff, saving the children (stopping them fall over the edge into experience or whatever it is down there). <br />If it was Chinaski in that field, those kids'd fall. He'd be boozing or reading. Those kids could fall off a cliff for all he cares. All those kids would probably hate him anyway. They'd all be the sort of kids who called him names whenhe was small. Chinaski would sit on the edge of the rye field, daydreaming about his teacher's skirt.              <br />&quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a book you read (and love? yeah, maybe) when you're sixteen, when you still believe in things, when chances are laid out like a hand of cards. You read &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; and you take it seriously. &quot;Ham on Rye&quot; is a book you read when you know a little more about life. You know life can be hard. Not all the time. Don't get me wrong. Life can be plenty great too. Just sometimes. Life can be hard. You don't always get what you want and it isn't always down to chance or fate or anything else. Sometimes life is tough through no fault of your own. Life can be beautiful (beautiful like a teachers's raised skirt? yeah, maybe), and life can be ugly (because, hey, it's always other people get the breaks, am I right or am I right?). <br />&quot;Ham on Rye&quot; knows it. Bukowski knows it. You know it. I know it. You find joy where you can. You find joy here.
0380788624|5.0|This is a great book. I was very sorry to finish the book, but at least at that point I got a life back. The story is a great read. Typical stephenson story telling. My wife, who is non-technical, couldn't put the book down.
6304030959|5.0|&quot;Jumanji&quot; is a classic movie that any1 could watch over and over again. It is full of eye catching surprises, horrifying phenomenon, excitement and is all just one great laugh. It is funny to think you can get all this from a movie that is based on a game called &quot;Jumanji&quot;.   It is based on a little boy called &quot;alan parish&quot; who hears a sound, like a constant thumping, in a construction site near wehre he lives. The sound comes from the board game Jumanji, and alan finds it buried in a wall of dirt in the construction site. He gets his friend &quot;sarah&quot; to play the game with him until he is lost in the game for quite sometime.  Eventually newcomers come to the parish estate, and the game is found again, alan is brought back into the movie.  After Alan and his new friends locate Sarah, they must finish the game to end all the happenings that come out of the game. They must fight of monkeys, lions and all kinds of phenomenon that come out of the game.  This is a movie full of excitement, and is a guaranteed watch by any1 interested.
B000006U44|1.0|Oh my worms, listening to this 1978 debut was a *nightmare*. Kate Bush sucked me in with her \\"Hounds of Love\\" LP first. Then a friend recommended \\"The Kick Inside\\" and that spewed me right back out. <br />Obviously, many enjoy this album; but let me warn you: it is NOT for everyone. All I heard were intolerably high pitch shrills and squealing of a talented young Irish bumpkin stuck in too-high a vocal range alongside dreadful songs with inconsequential piano music. It was extremely irritating to me (like nails on a chalkboard). I couldn't help but envision Kate as the old stereotype of the teenage girl singing near a pink, ruffled canopy bed, gazing out the window at horses in the foggy field, wondering what the outside world holds ... all while the hormones of insecurity explode through the music.  (Incidentally, I AM a fan of the shrills and sopranos and piano of bjork, elizabeth fraser & enya, suzanne ciani, respectively.)<br />Sadly, after listening to this I haven't searched further into Kate's repertoire pre-\\"Hounds of Love\\" in fear of touching on the sound of this CD again.
0375703764|4.0|The horror of horror stories (and by implication ghost stories, haunted house stories, creepy stories of any kind) pretty much starts to fade the instant anything definite gets said. If you hint at what the peculiar shapes made by the shadow in the corner of the room may mean, it's (possibly) terrifying. If you come all out and say, &quot;boo, look, it's a monster!&quot; It stops being scary. Monsters aren't scary. Nobody believes in book monsters (could be half to do with the fact that there are far enough monsters out there in the big bad world). <br />The trick to fear (book fear, at any rate) is - keep the rabbit in the hat. The rabbit only ever disappoints. Tell us you've got something in the hat. Go on about it if you have to. Lie if that's the best you can do (so it's a rabid, bionic, nuclear, fifty-foot high rabbit, then . . .). Just don't give the game away.<br />Danielewski has learned the trick, and &quot;House of Leaves&quot; is shadowplay atop shadowplay (an enormous shadowy black house that defies physical laws by existing within another perfectly ordinary suburban house). A horror story that obeys the fundamental laws of prestidigitation : obfuscation, sleight of hand, distraction. He doesn't even tell the story himself. (Hell, it isn't even a story, in the strictest definition of the word.) Johnny Truant - an LA tattoo dude - tells you about how he and his friend Lude discovered this manuscript in an old dead guy (Zampano)'s apartment. The manuscript tells you about this film - The Navidson Report - that Johnny Truant thinks doesn't even exist. <br />The film that the manuscript tells you about is made by Will Navidson, an award-winning photo-journalist. Navidson intended to make a documentary about family life. He bought a house. Stationed cameras roundabout. Recorded what followed. Only what followed wasn't what he expected. A door appears out of nowhere upon the living room wall (a living room wall that is flush with the outside world). You open the door and what do you see? Not the outside world, that's for sure. A ten foot black corridor. You follow the ten foot black corridor. Where does it go? Another longer corridor full of closed doors. You ignore the doors and follow the corridor. It leads you into a great hall. Through the great hall into a vast hall. Through the vast hall to a staircase that takes you eight hours to walk down. You're a little freaked out by now so you decide to make your way back. Only nothing is as it was when you first passed through. The stairs are only ten feet high. Doors have moved around. Corridors have moved, lengthened, shortened. The living room isn't where it was. The shape of everything changes and what is that sound? Sounds like a creature roaring back there somewhere. <br />The book itself doesn't keep shape : aside of the Braille, the 'lost' text (pages Johnny cannot find, pages Johnny spills ink on), burn-holes in the manuscript that obliterate letters and words, blood and claw marks, there are sentences that run across the gutter and fill two pages, words that are set diagonally at the page edge or compressed in small boxes (as the space within the house compresses). There is the now infamous 'labyrinth' chapter (footnotes in boxes, upside down, sideways, following page numbers, reversing page numbers). There are quotes in Italian, in German, in Spanish, in Latin, in Russian, in French. There are translations. The Zampano manuscript is a regular Babel (or rather, the razed foundations of a Babel, what's left after the end). <br />Only it isn't just the manuscript (or the film) you have to contend with. This is a book that has been edited to include emailed comments from characters involved in the action from after the second edition of the book (girls Johnny and Lude have slept with who don't approve of their inclusion). Navidson is filtered (if he's real) through Zampano (if he's real) through Truant, through an editorial team, through a publishing house, through the Internet. <br />It's neither either/or nor both/and. It's a new kind of game (on a very old board). Sort of : chess played on a Brancusi spiral with Giacometti figurines. Which for the most part is lots of crazy fun (you're reading, holding the book sideways on, turning everything upside down, reading 90 pages in about ten minutes). It's not perfect - parts of the 'Labyrinth' chapter are laborious, some of Zampano's extemporisation is plain boring and could have been cut (regardless of what Truant alleges, Dave Eggar-style in footnotes) and there are way too many footnotes - but, overall, by the time you (don't) get to the Scooby Doo-style unmasking, you've enjoyed the ride and - yes - seen genuinely unsettling things here.<br />You develop a kind of theory as to what the Book of Leaves is (leaves = pages = the book of books), which leads you to realise this isn't a horror story at all - it's a kind of skit (like Calvino's &quot;If on a Winter's Night, a Traveller&quot;). Not a trick, more a clever-clever (ab)use of genre. Which is fine. And entertaining. And different (which is cool).
B00004XOWM|5.0|This CD is awesome, you're gonna wanna pick it up.  It's got the Limp bizkit rock like normal, with some rap/hip-hop tracks like &quot;Getcha' Groove On&quot; and &quot;Rollin (Urban Assault Vehicle).&quot; It's definetely worth it.
0446677450|1.0|Save your money!  Whatever you pay for this book is probably too much.  It is full of useless rhetoric, and appears to be written at a very low level.  It is full of examples which just seem to farfetched to be believed.
B00004X01U|5.0|Finally!  Techno I can understand and relate too!  Madonna has done it yet again- re-invented herself and her music to flow with the times.  If there is anyone out there that could hold themselves from hitting the dance floor when &quot;Music&quot; is on you must not be a fun person. The beat is catchy and with just a touch of some funk. &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is sure to become another club hit.  It pulsates and has a beat that takes you to another level of fun with its synthesized back ground and its sampled words (&quot;rumba, rumba, rumba&quot; and &quot;samba, samba, samba&quot;).  So, then we hit her ballad,&quot;I Deserve It&quot;...  Yes you do Madonna and we are all happy for you. This song has come a long way since her &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and &quot;Crazy for You&quot; days.  You can definately see the change in Madonna and it's all good.  I recommend this to anyone who loves to move and reflect on what life may throw next.
B00004T8RK|5.0|this cd is a wonderfull work by the group. It has a wide array of songs dealing with many different subjects.

B000002H2H|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is Metallica's greatest pre-Black Album album. A lot of people say it's Master of Puppets, but I personally think this one is better.<br />Here are the pros and cons(and takes):<br />Pros:<br />* This album shows the versatility of Metallica, when they were 22-23-year-old! Anti-war epics, ballads and instrumental work aren't something you hear a lot from young rockers.<br />* Contains an excellent set of songs. Here are some quick takes:<br />-&quot;Fight Fire with Fire&quot;: the albums opening track is definitely Metallica's fastest song, and probably the fastest song of all time (mainly the rhythm guitar). James plays Rhythm guitar with his usual good taste and flawless accuracy, but this time, it's way faster. Whoever thought that he could outdo any song on &quot;Kill'em All&quot;? Like, did anyone think that, say, &quot;Metal Militia&quot; or &quot;Whiplash&quot; could've been beaten? Not me, and I was proven to be a million miles away from being correct.<br />Folks: you have to hear the songs yourselves to know what I'm talking about. And believe it or not, as if the awesome speed of the song wasn't enough, Jaymz plays even faster at the chorus! Wow!<br />Totally awesome thrasher.I give this an 7 out of 10.<br />-&quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;: the album's title track is an anti-Capital punishment epic. A lot of people say the song ain't that much, I disagree a little. While the melody of the vocals was inconsistent at times, over all, the song featured some amazing instrumental work. For instance, listen to James' guitar after the second chorus, and you can't help but admire the amazing speed. The intro is excellent, and it gets much better after several seconds.<br />I give it a 4.<br />-&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;: well well well! Here, the REAL Metallica starts to shine! If this song isn't great, then I don't know what to call it.<br />Let's take'em one by one: the lyrics show staggeringly beautiful poetry and balance, which makes it one of Metallica's best lyrics to date. The rhythm guitar(played by vocalist/songwriter James Allan Hetfield, for those who don't know) features one of Metallica's most powerful riffs(if you count Metallica's powerful riffs, you will never finish), and its tune is awesome and REALLY memorable. As for Hammett, while he didn't do one of his usual right-after-the-second-chorus-solos, he did participate with a memorable riff at the beginning and between choruses. As for the bass, well! Let me just say that the bass is THE most memorable part and definitely Metallica's greatest bass work so far(here it's done by ex-bassist Cliff Burton who died later, but the bass is done later much better by Jason Newsted, the current headbanging bassist). As for Lars, what could I say about this drum legend? Everything Lars does is absolutely amazing. I've yet to hear someone who drums better than him. His use of drums and percussions in this particular song is extremely powerful and very well-timed.<br />Any music fan will love this song. Take my word on that. I give it an easy 10.<br />-&quot;Fade to Black&quot;: Metallica's first ballad. Not bad. Good Hammett solo. Some fast rhythm riffs by James. Fine lyrics. The first 20 or so seconds are my favorite part of the song, where they show mingling of the two guitars. However, if you want Metallica's best pre-Black album ballad, listen to the album &quot;Master of Puppets'&quot; &quot;Sanitarium&quot;. For Metallica's finest ballad, listen to &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; on the Black Album.<br />I give this a 5.<br />-&quot;Trapped Under Ice&quot; and &quot;Escape&quot;: to me, they sound like fillers.<br />-&quot;Creeping Death&quot;: do I really need to say anything about this particular song? I bet you've heard it or at least heard about it endlessly. It's one of Metallica's all time greatest songs, featuring what I consider guitarist Kirk Hammett's finest solo to date. The lyrics are just so cool, and James' rhythmguitar riffs are totally delicious. Lars, as always, shines, with his flawless timing, very powerful drums(definitely the heaviest drums and percussion I've had the pleasure to experience) and spectacular use of percussion.<br />This song is one of the fans'(and definitely the band's) favorite songs in concerts. It features one of the greatest moments in heavy metal history: the part of the song right after Hammett's solo(starts there, and ends with the last &quot;killing firsborn man&quot;). This part is mind-blowingly powerful and amazingly enjoyable. If you are a regular music fan, you will feel sheer joy listening to that specific part. If you are a heavy metal fan, you will get what I call a musical orgasm. You don't have to believe me; just listen to the song and wait for the solo, then when the solo ends, pay attention.<br />Cliff's bass at the end adds more depth and life to the song. It's kinda sad. I don't know why, but the bass just sounds sad. It sounds like a part that would be played when someone dies. It's very beautiful though.<br />It gets a 10.<br />-&quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot;: Metallica's first instrumental(lets not count &quot;Kill'em All&quot;'s &quot;Pulling Teeth (Anesthesia)&quot;, since it was mainly bass) is a musical masterpiece that shocked me. What shocked me is how could a young rock band have so much depth? I could understand it if they did it now, but way early? <br />Anyway, this stunning piece of art has only one flaw: it's a little too long.<br />I give it a 6.<br />Bottom Line: <br />-For regular music fans, you might like &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; and &quot;Fade to Black&quot;. The other songs are a little too heavy to be enjoyed by non-heavy metal fans.<br />-For heavy metal fans, I highly recommend this album.<br />-As for Metallica fans, they don't need what I have to say,because they already have this album.
6305169187|1.0|This is a much more patriotic version of DEEP IMPACT in which not only does Bruce Willis emerge as an institution-hating, flag-waving, macho hero, but his daughter does as well (how is this possible?) Can the events in this movie actually happen? No! In ARMAGEDDON truck-sized meteors shower Manhatten with a force that overturns cars and creates craters several feet deep. People have to hide behind cars, lampposts and buildings to avoid them. Actually each meteor of this size would create craters hundreds of feet deep, hundreds of yards wide, and would vaporize all the cars, lampposts, buildings and people in the area. In ARMAGEDDON Earth is threatened by an asteroid &quot;as big as Texas&quot;.  There is only one asteroid in the solar system this large -- Ceres with a diameter of 1025 kilometers -- and it is not an Earth-crosser. It isn't needed. The asteroid that collided with Earth 65 million years ago and spelled the end for the dinosaurs (and most of the rest of life) was probably 6 miles wide.
B00004XONN|5.0|How many bands can toss conventionality, marketing sense and even their own instruments to the wind? And pull it off. Radiohead. The only thing I think die-hard fans WANTED from this album was for them to stick one thing: alienation. <br />The reason OK Computer connected is that it's not just pretty art-rock, it's a message about living in a fabricated, virtual world. Kid A is a message as well: The world is going to hell, fast. &quot;try the best you can.&quot; Corporations have taken over. Just look at the music biz. This band expresses their utter frustration with this bleak future through music, sounds, whatever you want to call it. <br />Kid A sounds like someone desperately trying not to lose their mind in dealing with the future. (much like OK Computer) Songs about disappearing, following the pied-piper out of town, dinosaurs roaming the earth, seeing you in the next life, living in a fantasy... No one wants to swallow reality's bitter pill. It's an album about escaping, but to where? The next life?<br />I think the album is perfectly expressed by a moment in Morning Bell, about halfway through, where you think the band is going to transport you to some spine-tingling musical climax (&quot;round and rooouuunnnd...&quot;) Instead, the song just drifts off. Sadly. Beautifully. Back to reality.<br />Great stuff. Not for everyone. Not for optimists. Keep it up Radiohead. I particularly appreciate the message about global-warming in the Special Edition CD cover.
B00004YKUX|5.0|This is the best CD of Johnny Cash's three studio albums from American (which include; American Recordings, Unchained, American III).  Johnny Cash covers music from other artists and also shares some of his own new compositions.  Johnny Cash also welcomes many famous guests to perform with him.  Legendary performers such as Tom Petty, Sheryl Crow, Merle Haggard, and June Carter Cash aid this album into becoming an instant classic.  If you are already a fan of the newer Johnny Cash material you will love this album. If not a fan, you are soon to become one after a listen to his new one AMERICAN III: Solitary Man.
B000002H33|4.0|What is it about this album? The fans that deserted Metallica when they changed their style(i.e. the so-called &quot;hardcore fans&quot;) consider this the greatest album of Metallica's career. While this album certainly stands out and blows away anything that bands like Motley Crue ever did and could ever do, it definitely isn't Metallica's best.<br />Pros:<br />* Very versatile and deep album.<br />* The A-side is just amazingly good.<br />* Quick takes:<br />-&quot;Battery&quot;: Cool thrasher. Is it just me or does its overall structure sound just like &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot;? A little acoustic at the beginning and then, boom, Heavy Metal madness! Listen to S&amp;M for a better version.<br />I give this version a 5.<br />-&quot;Master of Puppets&quot;: one of rock's all-time greatest sons, a super-popular favorite among the fans, and an amazing epic. Just listen to the fans when it's played. The best version of this song is in S&amp;M, although you might find the symphony a little annoying at the beginning of the song.<br />I give this a 9.<br />-&quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot;: Wow! How innovative could you get?<br />What is it with songs that are inspired by novels? One of Nirvana's best songs (&quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot;) is inspired by a novel, and this one is no different. I give it a 7,but the S&amp;M version is ten times better in every possible way.<br />-&quot;Sanitarium&quot;: Metallica's best pre-Black Album ballad, and it's absolutely amazing. Heartbreaking and well-written song, this is probably the first song you'll like.<br />I give it a 7.<br />-&quot;Disposable Heroes&quot;: It starts strong, and then gets a little annoying. If you want a better war song, try &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;.<br />I give it a 2.<br />-&quot;Leper Messiah&quot;: While it spreads a noble message (apparently, attacking people who say something and act otherwise), it gets repetitive after a short while.<br />I give it a 3.<br />-&quot;Orion&quot;: This instrumental piece is late bassist Cliff Burton's favorite, and I am not surprised by that, since he was pretty active in it. However, it isn't better than &quot;The Call of Ktulu&quot;.<br />I give it a 3.<br />-&quot;Damage Inc.&quot;: this thrasher's got a pretty cool name. I don't think it's that good though.<br />I give it a 2.<br />I know that the last 4 ratings will upset a lot of people, but hey, it's just my opinion. You're not obliged to take it.<br />Cons:<br />* As you might have guessed, the B-side isn't as good as the A-side.<br />Bottom Line: a satisfying choice for metalheads, but other than them, I don't think you'll like it that much, except for &quot;Sanitarium&quot;.
B00004XONN|5.0|They just ain't gonna do what you want 'em to. But just 'cause it's weird doesn't make it bad; and no, just because other people did it first doesn't make it stale. There are some songs on this album I could do without (treefingers, optimistic) and it is by no means like any of their other albums. But is The Bends like Pablo Honey (no, thank God)? Is OK Computer like The Bends? No again. If you think that Radiohead couldn't crank out another OK Computer, think again; they've already got the songs recorded (it'll be out next year). Why would they? What purpose would it serve? We've got enough of those bands in the world already, trust me.  That being said, don't listen to this album comparing it to the earlier works. It's not even comparable. However I think the strangeness of it is really overstated, and seems to be mainly based on the lack of un-altered vocals. The sonic texturing is not much different than other albums, but more understated, less bombast. And the songs are downright catchy; in fact this may be Radiohead's MOST pop album since the mediocre Pablo Honey. Heck, it's even got a dance tune. The most important thing about radiohead is the emotion realized in every tune. That's something you get from too few artists today, and something radiohead has yet failed to do, even on this admittedly different album. You just have to work at it a bit more. If you want somebody to bake you a cake and decorate it in all your favorite colors, call your mom... they just ain't gonna do it. Thank God.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead have once again produced an amazing album that redefines the definition of rock.  Or is it even rock at all?  Kid A owes a bigger debt to electronic artists like the Aphex Twin, post-rock outfits like Tortoise, and modern classical than it does to standard rock conventions.  Opening track Everything In It's Right Places mixes a quiet pulsating beat, processed vocal cut-ups, and synths to form an eerily soundscape.  But Thom Yorke's inscrutable yet lovely vocals hold it together.  Throughout the album disparate elements come together to form new exciting shapes.  The National Anthem thrills with it's driving bass line, multi-tracked Ondes Martenot, and cacophonous horns.  But outside of the experimentation, there are also beautiful songs.  How to Disappear Completely is a downright gorgeous ballad.  As strings swoop down and surround Yorke's voice he repeats the simple mantra-like lyrics over and over &quot;I'm not here, this isn't happening&quot;.  Optimistic is only full return to guitar orientated rock and it won't disappoint.  It's immediately recognizable melody and classic structure make it most conventional Kid A track.  Motion Picture Soundtrack ends the proceedings in a somber mood as Yorke mourns over lost love.  It all ends too quickly and you'll wish it would never end.  Every track is something very different and special and all of them are great.  There's no filler on this album, it's meant to be listened to all the way through.  This is an album you can come back to again and again and never be bored with.  So don't believe the naysayers.  This isn't an overly avant-garde album of &quot;sound effects&quot; or random techno... .  This is a beautiful original work that takes experimental sounds and makes them into something new and while not &quot;radio-friendly&quot; suprisingly accessible once you get into it.  So if you're into good music at all Kid A is a must purchase.  It's Radiohead's best album yet, and definitely up for album of the year as far as I'm concerned.
0140434089|4.0|A gothic, male, version of any Austen novel you care to read.  Dark, brooding, sensuous and sensual, with brief lesbian undertones.  Many delicate touches but a gripping (if nowadays predictable) mystery tale, which also points up certain Victorian values regarding people, especially those set apart from middle and upper class sets.  A wonderful, imaginative book, which has left me thinking about it ever since.
B00003CWTI|4.0|P.T. Anderson once again shows his brilliance.  With another Phillip Baker Hall(The Insider, Hard Eight) team-up Magnolia was a brilliant Altmanesc story of one day in the valley.  Astounding fast pace directing and fantastic performances make this a runner-up for the best picture of 99' next only to &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;.  This is proof that the indy scene is where you look for future talant.  Let's just hope it's financial failiure doesn't discourage P.T.
B00003CWTH|3.0|To its credit this is an engrossing marvelously directed film that sucks the viewer in and refuses to let go.  It is also one of the best cast and acted movies I've ever seen.  The performances aren't great in that grand over the top way where everyone says &quot;What a great performance!&quot; The perfromaces are great in that you forget that you are watching actors and start to believe that the characters you see are real people.<br />On the downside, the movie never manages to go anywhere, and the stories never converge and are never satisfactorly concluded.  And what exactly was the point?  Still, this is a must see movie for anyone who really appreciates film, but I wouldn't want to own it or even see it a second time.

0060977493|3.0|Language beatiful and poetic but can't understand why it won a literary prize.  Not particularly well written, in my opinion.  The novel contains many very interesting images and the social history content is, in my mind, gripping.  I do find the time-travel tiresome though, and was not crafted in any way to keep my attention.  However, this is a very beautiful book, even although it is difficult to love any of the characters involved, we can identify with some of them.
6305807086|5.0|Easily the best picture of 99' and one of the best of all times &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is one of those fantastic journeys that is just so original that when you are finished you are left in awe.  What could be simply wrote off as a comedy is in actuallity a &quot;metephysical can of worms&quot;.  From the symbollism of the board to the desperate search for unatainable love it leaves drama to wallow in the shadow of comedy.  Go in with an open mind and prepare to leave with a blown mind.
B00004XOWM|3.0|I have been listening to Limp Bizkit ever since Three Dollar Bill Y'All came out. I loved that CD, and later bought Significant Other.  I liked it, but not as much as Three Dollar Bill.  I recently bought Chocolate Starfish the first day it came out, having heard Rollin' and My Generation, and I have to say, although the CD is good, I was dissappointed. Some good songs include Livin' It Up (recording of the full version of the song Durst did with Christina Aguileria at the MTV Video Awards), Rollin', My Generation, Hotdog, and Take a Look Around (from MI:2). However, songs like the other version of Rollin' with DMX, Method Man, and Redman, and Getcha Groove On made it more sound like I was listening to just another Rap CD, which is dissappointing coming from Limp.  To Limp Fans who liked both of their other CD's, I would say that it is worth the money, but it is dissappointing.
B00004U8PA|5.0|This movie is the best movie it has been around for 25 years and hasn't died yet it's like a disease that tons of people have caught and just can't seem to get rid of. I love the rock-n-roll songs that just get stuck in your head and you'll be singing them for weeks. I've got all of my friends addicted and they'll back me up on this it is the best cult, sci-fi musical. Many people have ventured into the castle and abandoned there sanity and will agree that it's one of the best movies ever.
0684853523|5.0|There are a great many books out there telling you what you need to know to be a successful writer. Some of them contain nuggets of truth, while some are no more than pretentious garbage. I'm very happy to say that Mr. King's book contains many, many nuggets of truth. In fact, it's one of the few books on writing that I've read that is also entertaining. The book works on two levels.<br />The first level is the pure entertainment aspect. Mr. King gives us snapshots of his early life which he says is &quot;my attempt to show how one writer was formed.&quot; Many of these snapshots are amusing and all of are just plain interesting to read. If the book never went beyond this point it would be a winner.<br />However, the second level is advice on writing. For aspiring writers it is a God-send. He likens his advice to the toolbox carted around by his carpenter grandfather and then his Uncle Orem. He shows what a writer needs to put into this toolbox and how to use it. He then goes on to describe how he works and writes even including a part of a story in rough draft form and then in second-draft with the edits marked. However, this is not a pedantic, dry work. Mr. King uses humor throughout. The overall message is that writing is fun, or should be.<br />All in all this is a good read with much helpful information. Whether you want to write, or just want to see how one of the world's most popular novelists goes about it, I recommend this book without reservation.
B00003CWRX|4.0|Mann's intense use of silence for suspense creates a great backdrop for the allstar performances of L.A. Confidential's Russel Crowe and the man who needs no introduction Al Pacino.  Although you often wonder how historically accurate this film is you cannot deny the brilliant use of wide aspect ratios and silent anticipation.  Although it's not Heat, it's a great film.
0679879269|3.0|First of all, I must say that Phillip Pullman is an extremely talented author. I think he has an awesome imagination and his works belong beside the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, Madeline L'Engle, and C.S. Lewis. Fantasy is my absolute favorite genre of literature and Pullman plays to my book-lust beautifully. But- and there's always that but- being the God-loving Christian that I am, I am a little more than disturbed about the whole Authority-destroying thing. I realize that without this element, the whole trilogy would be, well, let's just say different. The whole plot revolves around Lord Asriel's rebellion against Heaven and God. It scares me a little to think of the liberties Pullman takes in describing God as weak, manipulating, decietful, and as just another angel. He makes the reader want the rebellion to suceed and want God to be destroyed. I think Pullman is very wrong in his views of life and of a Supreme Being. I am not sure that I am glad I read this, and I'm not sure that I wish I hadn't. I am still absorbing the whole story, since I just finished the book a few minutes ago. I hope you, as the reader and as a human will learn the truth about God's love and His heavenly home for anyone who believes and accepts. God bless, and happy reading to you all.
0790736233|5.0|This movie stands head and shoulders above most science fiction.  I was really moved by it when it came out...  Before I forget, I want to recommend looking at &quot;Carl Sagan: A Life&quot; by Keay Davidson, or at &quot;Black Holes and Time Warps&quot; by Kip Thorne.  Both have some discussion of this movie -- Kip Thorne's discussion mostly has to do with Carl Sagan consulting him about the wormhole idea, but still.  Or, for more about the Drake Equation, look in your copy of Michael Crichton's &quot;Sphere&quot;.<br />This movie captures the excitement of astronomy, and the feel of SETI-like programs, to a &quot;T&quot;.  Jodie Foster is terrific -- I wonder if she considers this one of her better roles.  I hope so, because she blew me away.  Tom Skerrit plays a complete jerk, which is sort of a stretch for him, as he generally seems to get more solid, midwestern-American-values sorts of roles...  He does a good job though.  Rob Lowe has a minor but interesting part, as the movie's version of the real-life Ralph Reed -- look it up, seriously, that guy is worth knowing more about.  Also, Angela Bassett plays a powerful African American woman with her usual aplomb.  She brings a lot of intelligence and vividness to her part.  James Woods is pretty terrific too -- I would give a lot to hear his input on various scenes, he's no dummy, science-wise, as a real-life M.I.T. graduate. <br />The excitement of science is what you walk away from this movie feeling.  So often scientists in movies are &quot;mad scientists&quot;, or maybe an action movie hero type with a slightly introspective streak.  Jodie Foster's character is an atheist, a scientist, and of course a woman, but she makes a great heroine.  Generally this movie just rocks, and rocks hard.  I imagine that Carl Sagan would have considered this a fantastic curtain call, before he left this planet.  Two thumbs up.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This cd combines elements from the first and second cd and also uses hardcore rap(with songs featuring Xzibit and DMX)and techno.  The messages in the songs are usual limp bizkit stuff.  You may sometimes wonder if the songs have any meaning.  Don't get me wrong, many of the songs on the cd have substance, but don't expect to get inspired by the lyrics of these songs.  Who really cares about the message, though?  The important thing is the music and Durst's style are definitely enough to make you forget about the messages.  If you like cool music, get this album.
B000002KO3|5.0|Fear Of Music is better, still this is a heck of an album.  Dance, techno, beauty.  David Byrne and Brian Eno have their last collaboration and make it a good one.  A must have for Heads fans.  Perfect from beggining to end from the lesser known Born Under Punches to the big MTV hit Once In A Lifetime everyone loves this album.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I got the CD for a present from my friend, and it really sucks. The band has no talent, the lyrics are equivilent to 'retard talk', and they are just a ripoff of original bands like Rage Against the Machine, which, by the way, is the band that started the whole 'rap core/hip hop/rock' thing in 1992. Don't waste your money, this band is limp.
B00004XONN|5.0|&quot;Kid A&quot; definitely takes a while, and many listenings, to sink in.  But once it does, it reveals itself as a masterful album.  Completely innovative and abstract, but with just as many pop hooks as &quot;OK Computer,&quot; and with sonic landscapes worthy of Brian Wilson, Brian Eno, and Trent Reznor all wrapped into one.  A real landmark album that leaves everyone else out there, with the possible exception of Beck, in the dust.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Human Clay, a modern rock album musically and lyrically superb and rich, is thematically as sophisticated as any classical mass.  With minor guitar riffs, dark dissonant melodies, and lyrical depth Human clay consistently delivers  throughout giving the album a dark murky tone.  Similiar to a Mozart Mass, particularly his Requiem, Creed's Human Clay is a musical mass for life, the spirit, and the soul. Besides the singles released, the album is full of other outstanding tracks which are equal if not better to the released material. Favorites include &quot;Faceless Man&quot; which tells the story of getiing in touch with the inner spirit, &quot;Never Die&quot; which is centered around youthful immortality, &quot;Wrong Way&quot; , and &quot;Say I&quot; which is a introspective look at human self-percetion from without. Human's clay lyrical content is poeticly consistent in depth and meaning.  Human Clay, the overall theme of the album and also an interesting title  focuses on issues of life any introspective person can relate to, not only in the physical world but in the spiritual world as well and  the human search to bridge these two worlds. Amidst a parade of  superficial pop music today Human Clay is exceptional and in the sense of being a classic, phenomenal despite the seeming rendundacy of grunge music.
6303407188|5.0|Tim Burton's best(yet OOP) film casts Burton favorite Depp and the Mission Impossible great Landau(in his best performance).  It makes Wood's already hilarious image and makes it funnier with the image of brilliance they portray him with.  How can you get funnier then looking behind the scenes of already horribly funny flims? You can't. PLEASE GOD, RELEASE THIS ON DVD.
6304078102|5.0|One of the most beautiful films I have seen. Totally overlooked by most reviewers, however, was the magnificent, touching  performance by the beautiful young Jean Louisa Kelly as Rowena. Her presence in the film was a gem of casting; her voice is that of an angel.  She brought me to tears.  And now we find that she is also a fine comedy actress, as witnessed in the new CBS sitcom, &quot;Yes, Dear.&quot;Hopefully, we will see much more of this lovely lady in the future. I am in love.
B00004Z400|4.0|I LOVED White Pony.. In fact I had downloaded the album off of the 'net before it was release officially, and the promo had Back to School on there. I was upset it wasn't on the CD. NOW I understand. A marketing gimmick! Well, I will probably still buy it, just because I'm a die hard 'tones fan, but it stills seems like a crazy idea.  If you don't own White Pony, buy this one.  If you have it, I wouldn't bother.
B000002KNY|5.0|The best Heads album and my second favorite album of all time next only to Floyd's Dark Side.  Byrne creates a transition between Buildings and Remain in Light that remains forever embedded in my mind as a social commentary and funk album that will stand as one of the all-time greats.  If you like this avoid post Speaking In Tounges albums.
020530902X|5.0|This book is the grand daddy of style books, and still the best.  It is simple and easy to follow, and provides excellent examples.<br />I recommend this book to all my writing students, both from law school and from fiction workshops.
B000006TRV|5.0|The band Pink FLoyd can never out do this album.  If anyone has ever had psycological problems this is the album for them...along with the movie this is the best thing ever written.  Just the music can pull emotions from you you have forgotten.
B00003CWPR|4.0|In the year of American Beauty this film was blown off by the moviegoing public.  A tragedy.  Awe-inspiring direction from the maker of all time greats like 2001 and Dr. Strangelove works in syncronization with the team-up performances of Cruise and Kidman.  One of the three best films of 99' and Kubrick's best since Barry Lyndon.
0679879269|4.0|Pullman's elegant and descriptive writing is as wonderful as ever.  The epic battles involving the Authority, Metatron and the rebellion are inspired.  The relationships that continue to develop between Lyra and Will are delicately balanced against the action and philosophy of the book(s).<br />But the book was too long.  The stories of Father Gomez, Mary and the Mulefa are throwaways and ultimately disappointing.  Why are they there?  What do they add to the mythology or the plot?  Not much, especially in the case of Fr. Gomez, who is ostensibly hunting Lyra throughout the book but never becomes a menacing character that we actually worry about.<br />Another round of edits would have made this book perfect.  Even so, The Amber Spyglass wonderful as it is, and the series taken as a whole is destined to join the Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia as fantasy masterpieces.
B000024D4R|5.0|When I first heard Animals I, like many other Floyd fans at their begginings, wanted The Wall or Dark Side.  I found Animals to be boring.  Thanks to a fellow Floyd fan I was convinced to take a closer listen.  Now several months later I have come to find this is one of my favorites (if not the favorite).  It's beautiful guitar work, repititious, simple, but effective lyrics, and mesmerizing keyboards make this a masterwork to behold.
B00004YKUX|5.0|This is a wonderful album from an American legend.  It ranks right up there with American Recordings in terms of latter-era Cash performances.  If you don't get chills listening to his death-row voice trembling in defiance and fear as he approaches &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; then you don't have hairs on the back of your neck.  Just two songs later, though, the crystal-clear harmonies in &quot;Field of Diamonds&quot; will bring you to an entirely different emotional space.  The covers of &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot;, &quot;Solitary Man&quot;, and &quot;One&quot; make you wonder how such familiar songs can be reinvented so completely and convincingly.<br />This album is good stuff - grab it today.
B000007T2Z|4.0|Alternative music always seems to be able to come up with some surprise. Quite often, such a surprise is the synthesis of different styles heard before. But still, the molding of older elements can lead to amazing results. Godspeed You Black Emperor managed to create such a result.  I have to say I am a big fan of Mogwai so in a sense, it is no surprise that I like this album. Godspeed etc. use some elements Mogwai made popular, namely slowly building noisy guitars. But then, Mogwai probably took it from somebody else etc. etc. What Godspeed etc. added are violins and tapes so that, in the end, the result is a claustrophobic soundscape. The CD is never boring although it clearly violates everything people &quot;know&quot; about song writing. Plus, I have to say, now that Sonic Youth can't produce long and non-boring musical paitings any longer, it's good to hear somebody else can.
B000001E7L|5.0|this is the gold from this band! absolutely amazing!  no complaints worth every penny if not more.  i have been listening to this album for years and i breath it!  amazing amazing tracks if you want to get into them this is the best to hear first.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Here in England, Limp bizkit are new on the scene, but I got their previous two albums last year, and it seemed like forever before this one came out. I have to say that I was highly disappointed - it isn't a bad album, but it doesn't strike me as being really good either. There is more rap in this album, but it doesn't go down very well - lots of peps have said this. Saying that though, I love the track 'boiler' and 'my generation' - but already it is getting over played so I will have to put the album away, and listen to three dollar and sig. other until album number 4 comes out. Buy the album to support Limp and get them to the top though.
0887308589|5.0|This hilarious book looks at the life - or at least that significant part of life spent at work - of an employee at a large corporation.    I've read this book while working for Intel Israel, but the book reminded me of my previous work for the Israeli army (probably because my managers and coworkers at Intel did their job well).    The memories of being assigned ridiculus tasks by pilots & tank commanders turned project managers by virtue of 'hiding in the attic for 4 years' resurfaced, as well as memories of enlisted personnel being trained to become officers en-masse in place of technical training (little budget for professional courses, lots of budget to train the technically untrained to become managers).    Being able to look back and laugh at it was a releasing experience.    How many people were rewarded for saving a few cents' worth of printer paper, and then order by a major to spend thousands of dollars from one of the squadron's budgets so that a big amount of money would be allocated to it the next year, and being reprehended for failing ?    The ability to look at corporate life with all their beurocratic wierd twists and illogical abberations and laugh is most refreshing.
1573226521|3.0|The Beach is the perfect book to read if you are backpacking in Asia which is exactly what I was doing when I picked this novel up.  The dialogue is sharp and the novel is impressive in its intensity and in its commentary on the pursuit of the exotic.  This young, first time novelist has captured much of the controversy that exists in Asian tourism.  Many westerners long for and, in some cases, expect the true untouched &quot;exotic&quot; when they travel to Asia.  Of course, the irony lies in the fact that once they discover the &quot;exotic&quot; it is no longer truly undiscovered and hence it loses some of its allure.  The weaknesses of this novel include a disjointed ending and a tendency to borrow plots from other books such as the classic island suspense novel, Lord of the Flies. Richard, however, is an engaging character as are his friends in the island community.
0385495323|5.0|I also read Simon Singh's book on the Fermat theorum, and I think he has an excellent very readable style of writing.  He certainly makes code writing very, very interesting.  No doubt at all that this is a five star book for me -I'm eagerly awaiting the next topic that Simon tackles.<br />On the really (really) picky side, I would have expected to have seen some more questioning and possible lines of attack on the PGP system -especially after the entire book seems to be devoted to pointing out that after many ciphers were considered unbreakable they were eventually cracked.  <br />Hats off to Simon Singh again.
B00004XOWM|5.0|The usual intro that fans have come to expect kicks off this album, but do not be decieved; this not just the brilliant nu metal album that was eagerly anticipated by all, this album is full of expresion, this is the most angry and hungry i've limp bizkit sound since breakstuff. Although this is probably one of the best albums i've ever had the privelage of listening to, i cannot help but be deeply disapionted by'my generation' fred's usually powerful voice sounds like an angry briteny spears; whitch scares only 8 year old kids listening to pop music(did i mention how awful she is?).The weakness of one track cannot destroy the brilliance of this album. GO AND BUY IT NOW!!!
B00004XOWM|4.0|If you are like me you didn't like Significant other, becuase it was done for money, and it was trendy, but i liked the first two songs off of chocolate starfish and the hot dog flavored water, so i bought it the first day it was released. Limp goes bake to the basics, this album is much better than significant other, and unlike 3 dollar bill not all the songs sound the same. Durst works with his voice, and adds some great rhymes to the album. this is definetly worth the money
B000005S37|5.0|It is hard to add something original after all the other reviews on this page (someones very good, indeed) but I try to tell you about my own experience. I bought this record and I put it on the Cd player at my car. I hardly stand it the next five days, always listening to it, everytime I catch the car to go anywhere. My friends avoid me, telling me I was insane. I carry a girl who was hitch hiking on the road, and she was the only who liked it. Anyway, on the sixth day listenig to it, really having a very bad time, my ears opened up and the sound, the pure sound of great melodies hidden under all the noise filled my brain. Now I enjoy MMM very much. I mean, it is a far different experience from Transformer or Ecstasy or any other of his &quot;normal&quot; albums (except maybe White light/White heat, a very noisy one too), but is curious and can open your mind to instrumental music, and noise music (every Sonic Youth fan must love this album). Read also the &quot;notation&quot; of Lou on the cover, saying that his intention in doing music was not write abot sex, drugs and violence. I think it is the first time an artist explains an album on the cover. Other thing I must say is that Lou developed this album mainly to get rid of the record contract with RCA, and that he considers (I don`t know if today he thinks the same) it is just a bad joke and noise with no sense at all. Well, I think different. Sorry, Lou
B00004XOWM|4.0|this cd is awesome almost all of the tracks are tight if you are a bizkit fan this is a must have for you..  the reason i only gave it a four is the song &quot;hold on&quot; with scott weiland is horrible not very much like limp's usual stuff but overall this is a great cd.
0316920045|5.0|The novel's beginning is so odd and somewhat off-putting as to be like a qualifying round.  One is disoriented but at the same time being lulled by language and phraseology that will become consuming.  Then the chapter re: the pot-debauch and you know you're caught and in deep trouble.  Read it for an hour and you begin speaking in long, parenthetical sentences.<br />It will make you think that it's changing the way you think and look at the world but also make you a bit self-conscious about whether you're supposed to be taking it all that seriously.  I loved it, and feel like if DFW were to decide to start the church of Infinite Jest I would join.  Isn't that stupid?
B000031XCR|5.0|This CD has Celine's greatest hits and 7 new songs, including my favorite &quot;That's The Way It Is&quot;.  The CD is well worth buying for the great songs from the past and her new ones.  My biggest beef is that they edited &quot;To Love You More&quot; and &quot;It's All Coming Back to Me Now&quot;.  I also wish they had done a two pack, but that's ok 'cause I got the rest of her albums.  If you like Celine, you'll love this, so buy it!
B00004XONN|5.0|Over the last year or so, the Billboard charts have been dominated by mainly pop and hip-hop (not counting Santana, of course). The fact that a CD like Radiohead's latest effort can debut at the top of the charts is quite a surprise. There are no singles or videos planned from the album, and I can't imagine any of the songs being played on commercial radio stations. If that's the type of station you normally listen to, then Kid A will probably sound unlike anything you've ever heard before.<br />  The first thing that Radiohead fans will notice is the apparent lack of guitars. There's nothing that comes close to songs like \\"Creep\\" or \\"My Iron Lung\\" on Kid A. Ethereal is the permeating theme here. Starting with the contemplative \\"Everything In Its Right Place,\\" the song centers on a sparse arrangement of just keyboards &amp; ghostly vocals. It's this track that sets the mood for the rest of the disc. \\"The National Anthem\\" starts off with a pounding bass line, and then about halfway into the song, things slowly begin to dissolve into a cacophonous orgy of free blowing horns. Not exactly your basic top 40 fare.<br />\\"Treefingers\\" is an eerie instrumental, similar to something you'd hear on one of the early Alan Parsons albums, or maybe a Brian Eno record. The CD's best (and most commercial) track is \\"Optimistic.\\" It's also one of the few times you hear any real guitar licks. Looking a good headphone tune? Check out \\"In Limbo.\\" With all its spacey textures and nuances, you'll hear something new each time you listen. <br />Kid A is the perfect example of one of those albums that you need to hear several times (and at a reasonable volume, I might add) to really appreciate. The good thing is that the songs have something about them that draws you back for more. You may not like them the first time you hear them, but you'll want to hear them again. The grandiose, thematic scope heard on 1997's OK Computer is nowhere to be found on this album. What you get instead is a glimpse of what the future of music may hold. There's one thing you can't deny about this record--it's different. And in this case, with the abundance of rap/metal and pop artists that have been on the charts recently, different is good.
0790734060|5.0|This is both a dramatic and comedic movie. Wonderful from start to finish with great performances, cinematography, a witty script and original music by Mozart. A Gem!!!!!!!
6305907145|5.0|I'm a big Jane Austen fan, but I think that Mansfield Park is her least enjoyable book.  The movie mixes Jane Austen herself, into the character of Fanny Price, and the story is all the better for it.  The book's Fanny is a repressed wimp, and she is ultimately praised for this.  The movie's Fanny has Austen's bitting wit, and a strong will.  The movie also de-emphasizes the story of putting on the play, which was a bit of a yawn in the book.  The film is beautifully crafted, and the acting is very good.  Even my fiancee, who doesn't like chick-flicks, enjoyed it and gave it 4.5 stars.
6305546789|5.0|After twenty some odd years you might expect that Halloween's lost it's appeal but to the contrary, it's as scary today as it was when it was first released.  Directed by a young John Carpenter, staring a budding star in Jamie Lee Curtis and made for practicly nothing it's no wonder Halloween's made it into the yearly retation of scary movies come October.  Curtis plays an awkward teen whose intellengence ostracizes her from most of her other classmates, a character trait that been beaten into the ground since.  So she finds herself without a date, watching The Thing (which Carpenter went on to remake) as she babysits for one of her neighbors.  The most frightening aspect is that Michael Myers intrudes on her daily life, she doesn't even have to leave home to find herself stalked by a knife-weilding manic.  Dr. Loomis chimes in at the last moment to save the day but most of his part's a wash.  He could've been utilized to ellaborate on Michael's condition, his sexual identity, his predatory instincts but instead is refined to telling tales of nothingness.  Still for those of us interested in the dynamics of a serial killer it's worth analyzing, especially when you've seen it so often, it keeps things interesting.  The DVD offers two versions of the film, but the twelve extra minutes serve little purpose but to break the pace of the film and is without of the 5.1 sound of the original.  The digital sound and remastered picture quality make this well worthwhile, even for those of us duplicating the disc.
B00004XOWM|5.0|I've heard many of the songs on this CD and if you are a Limp Bizkit fan or any other hard rock/rap fan you definatley have to buy this. &quot;Take a Look Around&quot; is one of the best songs on the CD (theme from M:I 2) and both of the &quot;Rollin'&quot; songs tie it up together nicley. I'm definatley getting this CD as I'm a huge fan of EMIN3M and Limp Bizkit. BUY THIS NOW!
0453007686|5.0|Wow! This is a really great children's book! Author, Jon Scieszka really wrote an interesting and entertaining spinoff of to the well known original story of the Three Little Pigs. This would be a great book for teachers to use in all the elementary school classes. However, ideally this book could be used for second and third grade children.  The book was basically about the wolf's version of what happened in The Three Little Pigs. I don't want to give the story away, but who ever reads it will find it quite enjoyable and humorous. Teachers can incorporate this book to teach lessons on QAR, people's different points of view, and writing persuasive letters or letters to the editor. It is a truly a useful book which can be used in many versatile ways. It's a great book!
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead has burned the traditional rock bridge and has conjured some swampy incohesive sonically bastardized stew of noise as a replacement.  <br />I love Kid A and couldn't ask for more. <br />Well, I could ask for this one thing: The limited edition packaging has somewhat ruined the rush-out-and-get-your-copy-ASAP phenomenon of this album for me. Not only does the album not have any lyrics or words, but its whole message a piece of propaganda--a call to arms against global meltdown. Yes Thom, let's beat this thing once and for all. <br />Radiohead sure must have gotten a kick out of penalizing the limited edition buyers (it's about the music, not the packaging, right?) by giving them less images less words less radiohead for more money. Not to mention the extreme inconvenience of the CD holding &quot;slip&quot; in the back. I'd rather a jewel case for usability (and that's not saying much at all). <br />The music is the beautiful garbage you'd expect from 21st century art-rockers Radiohead, though Kid A wears some shabby clothes. <br />        jon
1573225517|4.0|I was recommended this book when a friend of mine told me to read it; he then began this strange habit of asking me to list my top 5 favorite movies, songs, books and so on.  After reading the book, I began to understand his obsession and even (I admit with embarrassment) began to take part in the fun.<br /> Horby's portrayal of Rob (frighteningly my own namesake!) seemed just a bit too familir to me.  Not just because it reminded me of me, but so many other of my friends.  The book IS funny, yet tinged with a sadness too.  It was pathetic sad, and yes, funny too when Rob went to visit all his past girlfriends to find out what went wrong.  This brand of dark humour perhaps was too much for me - at times I almost found the novel humourously bleak.<br />Nonethless, Horby succeeds in creating orginal, funny, and , unfortunately, believable characters.  A highly recommended book.
6305949980|5.0|Not only is this film fantastic, this DVD was just as good.  The menu designs were really good and I loved all of the special features and Tim Burton's earlier movies.  It was really good.
0451169514|4.0|This is far and away Stephen King's best novel - but not his best writing if I can compare it with novellas where The Body (Stand By Me) and Rita Heyworth and The Shawshank Redemption would rank ahead of this.  So it is his best horror.<br />Yet I have never seen this is truly a horror book.  Cujo, The Shining, Christine, Carrie - those were horror.  There was an element of horror here and yet this book is not ABOUT that somehow.  The predominant theme in this book is friendship - the overpowering love that can exist between close friends.  This love never dies, it lives their whole lives.  King truly put a part of his soul into this book as he weaves a heartwrenching tale that leaves me still thinking about it 13 years after I have read it.
B00004XOWM|4.0|I do miss the nookie. But on Choclate Starfish Rollin, My Generation and The One keep the cd in the player long enough before you wanna thro the nookie in there. This album is very good, well written songs and great vocals. The band sounds greater than ever and Xzibit as a guest, did a great job. Congratulations to Fred and the boys on a great third album.
0790729725|5.0|THis movie has it all: drugs, killings, stealing, bribing, everything.........Check it out
B00004XOWM|5.0|Limp Bizkit have created the best cd i think that they can at this time.. it's just nonstop head bobbing to this thing.. fantastic grooves throughout.. I think it shows that Fred Durst and co. wanted to show people that the last cd wasn't just a fluke.. that they belong at the top of charts.. I could have just downloaded this whole thing.. but.. for something that shows the joy of music as much as &quot;chocolate starfish..&quot; does.. well.. they've earned my money..
B000002I25|5.0|Without a doubt this is the best album by &quot;The Doors&quot;.  My personal favorite is &quot;The End&quot;.  Every song on here is very good.  This is a must have cd.  The first ever by them.  Check out &quot;the end&quot;, it has very weird lyrics, its long, and the beat is AWSOME........GET IT NOW!!!!!!
B00003CX7L|2.0|I think there's something fun about it all.
6304795254|5.0|I had no idea what this movie was about when i first rented it.  For one, there has never been a movie like this.  Kind of hard to figure out throughout the movie.  Its about Micheal Duglous and he plays this game where all sorts of people are messing with him, like shooting at him, talking to him on the TV, you gotta watch this one.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I have to admit when i first heard this cd i was disapointed. It wasn't what i expected after getting dookie and the others (1039 Smoothed out slappy hours, kerplunk, insomniac, and nimrod. I expected it to be a lot like the other ones which had a drive into kinda sound, but this one is a little slower and dosen't have the same grinding guitar sound. At first i wasn't sure if i liked it but now i think it is great. The cd is a little slow but it still has great green day lyrics and a catchy sound. Some of my favorite songs are &quot;Castaway&quot; &quot;Warning&quot; &quot;Church on Sunday&quot; and a couple more like &quot;Macy's Day Parade.&quot; Even though i think this cd is great i still have to say that dookie is their best cd. Green Day has matured over the years and their music is changing but they are still my favorite band and always will be.
B00004U9MS|4.0|I picked up this album in France simply because there was a reference to Radiohead on the sticker. I was hooked the first time I listened to it. But yes, sometimes it seems like they are trying to sound like Radiohead but their music is great in a different way. I would suggest this to anyone who likes moody British rock without a lot of thinking involved. It is definitely one of my favorites for this year.
B00004XOWM|5.0|I luv this album it rules and my fav songs are, hot dog, getcha groove on and rollin but i like many more. Limp really did a good job and i am also going to get the limited editetion with eminem on it. THIS CD IS WORTH EVERY PENNIE I SPENT ON IT. Rock on Limp!!<br />If you didn't like this album check out their pervious releases:<br />Three Dollar Bill Yall$       and<br />Significant other
B00004XOWM|5.0|Limp Bizkit is the coolest band out there now.  So naturally their CD would rock, but this album is totally my favorite so far.  Rollin' and My Generation are my favorite songs in the CD.  So I totally say that everyone should buy this album!!!
B0000507UD|4.0|This album is okbut not worth the money for two bonus trax, pick up the regular one and save yourself some money
0345350499|3.0|I read &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; when a few years ago when I was thirteen years old, and I have to admit that Marion Zimmer Bradley has this over-sensitive, doubtful, extremely romanticised way of writing. Morgaine was thought to be mischievous, although she never was and her jokes were anything but funny (humor was a little lacking too). She was always whining, whining that she is the &quot;little, ugly fairy&quot;, and somehow, by the end of the book, I thought: &quot;Okay, this book is encapturing, but it is too flowery and sugary, and whenever they just 'offended' eachother, it was as if the world went under, and Morgaine had to escape to the Fairy Lands.&quot; I know that it was another time and another era, and that, back then, beauty and mind was different. Bradley tries to distinguish characters with various and completely different personalities, but as I see it, too many of them just result as being the same, and there is no contrast to the extremely frail personality Morgaine obviously has and between anyone else. The women cry, the men cry, the animals cry, there's basically no one with strength in the book. I can't guess how many oceans she cried by the end of the book. <br />The book was magical, it had an aura in it that made me page through the book, and not even skip any page like I usually do, OR read the end, because I'm bored. I love reading life-stories, but if Morgaine had A LITTLE more fire in her, a little more strength, which everyone lacked in the story, I would have enjoyed it as much as reading &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. I recommend that others read it, and form own opinions, but keep my comment in mind...
0399146253|3.0|By the time I had read The Last Precinct, I had already seen Patricia Cornwell give several interviews about it, so I had a certain expectation about what kind of book this would be.  For the most part, her descriptions were accurate, which is unfortunate.<br />From the beginning, this is a completely different Kay Scarpetta than we've read about before.  Cornwell claimed in her interviews that this could be a stand-alone book, that it wasn't necessary to read the previous books to understand this one, but I disagree strongly.  It literally picks up where the last one left off, and if you didn't read Black Notice, chances are you won't have a clue what's going on.  There are half-hearted attempts to bring the reader up to speed on the various characters, but they seem forced and uncomfortable.<br />The storyline is much the same as in previous books, despite Cornwell's assertion that this is the first time we see Kay in professional jeopardy.  There's a bad guy, Kay gets personally involved, Lucy goes off on some weird tangent, Kay's professional judgement is called into question..the bare bones of this story are the same as the others.  What bothered me most about this book was the extremely sudden and startling change in the way we see Kay, and through her, all the other characters.  She suddenly analyzes every thought, every emotion; we see all of the characters in a new light, and it is almost without exception, unflattering.  Suddenly we are literally forced to consider Kay's sexual orientation, Marino's weird attraction to her; even the deceased Benton is re-examined and somehow comes off looking the worse for it.<br />Cornwell said in the interviews I saw that she doesn't model Kay after herself, but there are several aspects of this book that almost feel voyeuristic.  The forensic and investigational parts of the book almost seem like an afterthought.  The main purpose of this entry in the Scarpetta series seems mainly to explore her psyche; at the end of it all, I've lost my respect for the character.<br />I had a hard time deciding how many stars to give this book.  Taken alone, simply judging this book's writing style, plot and character development, I would have given it 4 stars; as part of the Scarpetta series, comparing it to past books, I would have rated this one a 2, so I split the difference and gave it a 3.  Fans of the first books in the Scarpetta series who were upset after Black Notice probably won't be any more thrilled with this entry; fans that haven't read the first few books in the series and liked Black Notice probably would find this an interesting follow-up.it all, I've lost my respect for the character.<br />I had a hard time deciding how many stars to give this book.

0613071255|5.0|My first introduction to David Baldacci was back in 1996 when People Magazine picked his first book, Absolute Power, as the &quot;Page Turner of the Week&quot;.  I thought the premise of that book was phenomenal and I became an immediate fan.  For some reason, I skipped over Total Control and went on to read his third and fourth books, The Winner and The Simple Truth.  Both were good reads but nothing compared to Absolute Power.  I'm glad I went back and read Total Control because it's in true Baldacci form in my opinion.<br />In this offering, Baldacci takes the typical American family, Sidney and Jason Archer and their little daughter Amy, and pits them against corporate greed at its worst.  Sidney (the wife with a man's name) is a corporate attorney.  Jason, the husband, is an executive with a technology company.  Since Sidney is working on a deal that will merge her husband's company with another major technology firm, she is privy to many things that could lead to trouble.  Jason, on the other hand, is struggling to make more money so that his wife can become a stay-at-home mom to their daughter.  While this concept is characteristic of many American families, sometimes this drive can lead to a downward spiral of events from which there is no return.  When Jason disappears, it is up to Sidney to try to clear his name while trying to save her own job at the same time.  This book is replete with all the scenarios that followers of the thriller genre have come to expect.  There's a plane crash, a car chase, espionage, kidnapping, phone-tapping and the usual sinister characters you find in most of Baldacci's books.<br />I read most of this book on the plane traveling from Minnesota to Philadelphia.  It never seems to fail that when I'm flying, I'm usually reading a book that involves a plane crash.  The good thing about this book is that it is so fast-paced that I arrived at my destination without even realizing I had been in the air over three hours.  If you're looking for something that is suspenseful and believable, I think you'd enjoy this one.  I'd like to add that as I looked around to see what other people on the plane were reading, I was not surprised to see other readers with Baldacci titles in their hands.  I guess he's come a long way since that first book back in 1996.  Kudos to you David Baldacci for your well-deserved success.oking for something that is suspenseful and believable, I think you'd enjoy this one.

B00004SCX6|5.0|This CD is awesome for any kids at any age!. The album is a bigger improvement then the last one she had this one has songs on there that are really cool and don't get annoying after awhile but if your looking for a CD to buy for your son or daughter this is for you and there is no bad language like on the eminem CD's. It's worth the money trust me!
0790729725|2.0|This great film has been adequately lauded elsewhere.  The DVD, however, is terrible.  It is unecessarily and inexplicably 2-sided, which is very irritating.  The sound transfer is inconsistant, with dialogue getting lost in the background sound during several scenes.  And if you care about extras, there are none to speak of on this DVD.  A commentary from Scorsese would have been great, but there's nothing.  I love the film, but if I were recommending it to a friend, I would actually tell them to see the video instead of the DVD.
B00004XQP4|4.0|This Album is still very good its just like it sounds the same and well they always do but they ROCK and this does have some bad words in there not to many though so for kids like around the age 10 or older u should check into buying this green day is the type of band that like either u like it or you dont so listen to the preview first but awesome cd check it out
B00004XOWM|4.0|&quot;Limp Bizkit Presents Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot;...Definitely one of the funkiest titles I've heard in my lifetime so far. And, I'm sure it wont be the last. Funkiest is definitely one word to describe this album. Its got a nice blend of Rock and Hop-Hip. A testament of that is &quot;Rollin'&quot; (both Air Raid&quot;Rock&quot; and Urban Assault&quot;Hip Hop&quot; Vehicles), &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot;, and &quot;My Generation&quot;. Tho LB has lost a bit of their Punk edge that they had with &quot;Three Dollar Bill$ Y'All&quot;, there's still a hint of it in the song &quot;Full Nelson&quot;. This years (and into 2001) angst anthem(s) are definitely &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;My Way&quot;. The track &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; feat. Mr. X to the Z (Xzibit)has got a nice beat going there made by DJ Lethal. And the collaboration with Scott Weiland on the melody ballet &quot;Hold On&quot; is reminisant of &quot;Nobody Like You&quot; of last years &quot;Significant Other&quot;, only softer. There are also spoken cameos from actors Mark Wahlberg, Ben Stiller, Pro Skater Rob Dyrdek. This album wont compare to LB's breakthru &quot;Three Dollar Bill$ Y'All&quot; But it's a good album..more of a experimental album but like Wes Borland said,&quot;I think we have a solid fan base that will buy it, no matter whether it's shunned by the mainstream or not,that's who we made it for - them (the fan base), and for ourselves.&quot;  Die-hard fans of &quot;Three Dollar Bill$ Y'all&quot; will probably look at this album in disgust, Fans of &quot;SO&quot; will like this album....but if you're like me..both a fan of &quot;3DBY&quot; and &quot;SO&quot; and welcome changes in the music world then you'll enjoy this album.
0440219078|5.0|This book is the best book you will ever read if you ask me!. I mean this book has everything you want in a book and its for all ages there is nothing bad in there really unless your child doesn't know about death yet then you should wait. This book is perfect and it doesn't cost so much money so its worth it! trust me! once you read it you will understand!.
6304711905|5.0|This movie is in my all time top 10.  Val Kilmer as Doc is absolutely magnificent!  The writing for this movie was exceptional.  Sam is a gorgeous hunk as usual and Russell is top notch.  It'll make you want to strap on a six shooter.  If you appreciate quick wit, suspense and drama this is the movie for you.  You will not be sorry!
B00004SYWZ|5.0|This album is only but excellent, what can i say, specially for Velvel (my favourite one), to let you win, thought that it was you and i wish i cared. I would recommend it.
B00000I924|5.0|Like fine wines, Beck gets better throughout the years. In my opinion this work stands over wired and blow by blow. Such artyfacts as brush with the blues combined with powerful compositions as what mama said and the slight taste of angel give this last Beck work a first place in my musical preferences.<br />For me, much better than Clapton and Page, only can be compaired with Hendrix and Mc Laughlin.
B000025SUE|5.0|It's too bad that this lovely recording hasn't been more widely available because it's a real classic. The tunes are all wonderful - each with their own flavour and mood. Chet sings and plays throughout the CD and gives breathtaking performances. &quot;Everytime We Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Blame It On My Youth&quot; are two highlights of this set that are played with an almost unimaginable delicateness. The rhythm section is superb as well and certainly deserves great praise for their tactful accompaniment of Chet. This is one of the finest Baker recordings I have - it's a absolute gem!
B00003CWLF|5.0|Extra-Ordinary, an Absolute marvel of a classic masterpiece. A movie I would not mind having in my collection, and will, just as soon as it is released.<br />This film as you may already know, is the based on a true story remake of THE KING AND I, however, THIS IS NOT A MUSICAL. But trust me, you will not be dissapointed in any way. It is a wonderful film filled with beautiful scenery and gorgeous sets. The reinactments of the wars and rebellions were not perfect, but very well done.<br />Reasons for the Rating Pg-13 are as follows: Violence, an elaborate execution, mild torture and slavery, and some sexuality. But it is still a movie that you and your family can watch again and again, and enjoy forever.<br />This is a very romantic and powerful film, I give it an A plus and two thumbs up. THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY CHORIAGRAPHED FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN.<br />This is Acedog from The LuckyDog Newsletter: Movie Review Have a beautiful trip trough the foreign country.

6304779607|4.0|Cobra makes Rambo 3 look realistic and intellectually appealing.<br />A giant cult of insane axe-murders (not as cool as it sounds; remeber this is bad action not bad horror) takes on Stallone. <br />Guess who wins.<br />This film is pumped full of testosterone-fueled corniness, and seeps with pointless violence. If you laugh harder whenever Sly tries to be more serious, then get this, or at least rent it. <br />In my opinion, Cobra is a laugh riot!<br />P.S. There is one frightening thing about it however: Brian Thompson, an underrated character actor who is scary as hell itself.
B00004XONN|4.0|It would appear that our good friends Radiohead have pushed the envelope successfully. Any fan of the band would know that the bar was raised quite a bit from The Bends to their best OK Computer. In the case of their new album, Kid A, Radiohead takes us to outer space and keeps going. So you liked OK Computer but think this is tripe. Good. You are obviously not a fan of all of music's possibilities. Kid A starts with the slinky &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; complete with lush analogue keyboard sounds and Autechre-esque bleeps and blips. Knowing these sonic magicians, most these keyboard sounds are probably made by guitar. While it is a slower, interospective album than previous offerings, it still remains in the great headphone tradition of Pink Floyd and Eno. Sonically mesmerizing!! Nope, it won't make your local mainstream &quot;alternative&quot; radiostation playlists. But you shouldn't be listening to that garbage anyway.
B000009QPQ|5.0|I listen to a lot of cd's.  You could almost say it's an addiction.  Most of the ones I buy these days, I listen to 3 or 4 times, then forget about.  I guess listening to such a wide variety of music over the years has made me a little hard to please.  Something's really got to stand out to get my attention.  You can see where I'm going here - these guys got my attention!  This Jayhawks cd is almost constantly in my cd player - not because I have to justify buying it by listening to it a certain number of times, but because I honestly can't wait to hear it again.  I have to force myself not to listen to it over and over because I'm afraid I'll get tired of it like I always do, but so far it just gets better each time.  Heck, I have to force myself not to listen to each song 2 or 3 times in a row!  A prize like this more than justifies all the money I've thrown away on disappointments that end up collecting dust in my cd collection, and believe me I've wasted a lot of money over the years.  If you decide to get this one, do yourself a favor and listen to it at least 5 or 6 times before you make a judgement, and especially before you post a review.  Something this good just can't be fully appreciated with one listen.  The 5 star rating gets thrown around a lot, and I'm as guilty as anyone, but these guys really deserve it.
B000001GKC|5.0|Too bad I don't have six stars : it's worth it .It is the first time I hear all the sounds of this great symphony , and I must say I am socked by the reachness and the greatness of this recording !!  Karajan made his final recording as if he knew he would meet Bruckner , and somehow this was intended as a gift . This is far more remarkable than  other recordings of the 7th - even the one from 1971 on EMI with him and The Berlin Philharmonic .  As far as I am concerned , The Vienna Philharmonic  gave his best and probably there will never be something quit like this recording . The tempi are a little bit changed , regarding his '71 recording , but that makes the recording more interesting . The trumpet in the scherzo is absolutelly magnificent and by the way , I finally heard the flute in this movement : Karajan brings out the details of this symphony , something he missed to do with The Berlin Philharmonic . In the end , if you want a recording of the 7th , go out and buy this one !!!
0679736646|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of science fiction (fantasy is more my thing), but I'm taking a course in it this year, and one of the novels we were assigned was _Ubik_.  I picked it up this evening with a sense of reluctant duty... and put it down about four hours later, finished and wondering, \\"What *was* that?\\"<br /><br />I mean this in a positive sense!<br /><br />_Ubik_ reminded me, in some ways, of a very good mystery novel:  something is fishy in Denmark, and you're constantly tantalized with hints of just what it is and who is at fault.  This kept me entirely hooked into the book, and I was left dazzled by the possible meanings of the ending.  Sure, the prose might not be flawless, but who really notices when the plot keeps you turning the pages like mad?  I don't know a thing about the rest of PKD's work, but I'd certainly recommend _Ubik_, even for those who aren't enamored of the genre.

0380002930|2.0|People nowadays use the words 'masterpiece' and 'classic' maybe a little too much. There are only a few fiction books I really love among all the ones I have read; this is not one of them.<br />People have said ther is suspense in this book, but bewarned its only at the very verye end. In the beginning I was almost put to sleep by the rabbits and their endless journeys. I enjoy intellectually mature books- even long descriptive books (e.g. Tolkien, Les Miserables)- but I couldn't get myself involved in this story to much of any degree. It just required too much energy to stay focused on this book because it didn't offer up anything interesting. The rabbits just kept going from place to place to place looking for a warren. <br />If you have to read this for summer reading, be prepared for a long mundane tale. otherwise, just skip it.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Fred and the boys are back with their third CD, &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water.&quot; These rap/rock musicians bring a lot of energy to their music, and this disc is no exception. I think this CD is more influenced by their rock side, with songs like &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Rollin' 'Airraid Vehicle'&quot; but there are some major hip hop songs on there as well (&quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; [W/ Xzibit], and &quot;Rollin' 'Urban Assualt Vehicle' with Redman, Method Man, and DMX). I like this CD. I especially enjoyed the collaboration with Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots on &quot;Hold On.&quot; Bottom line is this, if you're a big Bizkit fan, you've already got the CD. If you're unsure, pick it up. It's good, and it's got a good flow and feeling to it. It's the new music for this new millennium.
B000009ROK|5.0|These recordings are exquisitely produced, played, and sung. The songs are glorious and there isn't a moment that isn't top-notch. This is incredible musicianship from start to finish.<br />Disc # 1: &quot;Romance&quot; from '91, is my second favorite of the set. It has 12 beautiful tracks and Armando Manzanero's &quot;Te Extra&ntilde;o&quot; is utterly sublime.<br />Disc # 2: &quot;Segundo Romance&quot; from '94 has 11 tracks and more beauty for your ears...Pepe Guizar's &quot;Sin Ti&quot; is fabulous, as is &quot;Historia de un Amor&quot;.<br />Disc # 3: &quot;Romances&quot; from '97 is my favorite of the three, with the lushest string arrangements this side of heaven. It has 14 tracks/15 songs, a wonderful upbeat &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; and one of my favorite melodies, &quot;Ma&ntilde;ana de Carnaval&quot;. Whether you buy this singly or as part of this set, don't miss this CD. It's an absolute must in any Latin music collection. Top 10 on the list !<br />The package (for me the packaging completes the work of art): It comes in a double jewel case, the front half has disc # 1 and the 3 individual booklets, discs 2 &amp; 3 are in the back half.  I wish this had been a set like Alejandro Fern&aacute;ndez' &quot;Mis Primeros Exitos&quot;(so perfect in every way !) with each CD individually wrapped and separate in a lovely box. This extraordinary trilogy of some of the best music ever recorded deserved that extra touch of elegance. Nevertheless, get them singly, or get them as a set, but get them...and enjoy these Latin classics done to perfection.
B000005H40|5.0|This is John Coltrane's only release on Blue Note records (at least under his name), and it is also one of their biggest sellers - and for good reason. Blue Train is not as adventurous as his Giant Steps or as hypnotic as A Love Supreme, but it is still very compelling. This is great straight-ahead jazz, whether it be the grooving &quot;Moment's Notice&quot; or the mellow and romantic &quot;I'm Old Fashioned&quot;.  Coltrane was a true visionary who died too young; at the risk of sounding pompous, there are three greats of whom we'll always ask &quot;what if&quot;?: Mozart, the Beatles, and John Coltrane.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This new album is the best that I have heard in a while. Limp Bizkit keeps with the same rythm but has added more bass to their songs this go around.  If you liked the 2 previous albums you can't go wrong with this one. These songs have a lot of self feelings from each of the band members. Everyone enjoy, I know I am.
B00004XONN|4.0|Review after review has commented on how the music on this album has similarities to other types of music or how Radiohead has gone down the tubes or how it't their most brilliant ingenius CD ever or how it isn't really rock...My review is inbetween all those dissenting opinions.<br />True, Kid A sounds like other music particularly with the obvious Drum-and-Bass influence on &quot;Idioteque&quot;, but it isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The music on the CD is still pretty good and Thom Yorke's voice, while sometimes distorted, sounds as good as ever.  Kid A is not an inviting CD the first time you hear it.  Unlike the blazing rousing first song &quot;Airbag&quot; from OK Computer, Kid A starts off with the low-key &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; complete with no guitars whatsoever in contrast to &quot;Airbag&quot; with its guitar assault.  Instruments foreign to rock albums appear all over Kid A like trumpets, organs, drum machine beats, harps, and synthesizers.  Most of the songs build up to obvious crescendos especially &quot;The National Anthem&quot; with a horn portion that will likely make you cringe the first time you hear it.  <br />However, it all seems to work most of the time.  This CD is best listened to as a whole.  It's only 50 minutes long including the short hidden track after &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;, so it's almost made to be listened multiple times.  This isn't Radiohead's best CD and it certainly isn't their worst.  It isn't what most would consider rock, but then again most people don't consider the Beastie Boys hip-hop despite obvious indicators.  If you're new to Radiohead listen to &quot;The Bends&quot; or &quot;OK Computer&quot; first.  What you'll find is that Radiohead always delivers the unexpected.  No one expected &quot;The Bends&quot; to follow &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; and nobody expected &quot;OK Computer&quot; to come after &quot;The Bends&quot;.   And I think no one expected this CD to be the way it is.  Radiohead always brings the unexpected.  And with this CD they brought a good CD different from their previous efforts.  It's not the be all end all of rock/alternative music and not the slump all rock bands supposedly have.  It's just a pretty good CD.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This is a really nice album.I really like the new single.But I like one of their old single better.But I forgot what the single is called.
0786707283|4.0|The first two parts of this book are excellent.  Part One is chilling because of its depiction of what is now known as Anti-Social Personality Disorder.  The fact that it was written way back in the 50's long before American Psycho's Patrick Bateman makes this even more creepy.  Part One manages to put the reader in the killer's deranged little mind and even makes us cheer him on a little bit.<br />Part Two of the book is excellent because it is completely different from Part One.  It puts us in the shoes of the victim from Part One's sister as she tries to discover the identity of the killer and narrows it down to two men, but which one?    <br />It's unfortunate that Part Three is so typical after the cleverness of Parts One and Two.  The ending isn't nearly as shocking as the end of Levin's later masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby   but up until Part Three you'll be on the edge of your seat.
B00004XOWM|4.0|This CD is well worth the money.  It is very good and there is more than the two good songs that you have heard so far.  The Cd is very good.  I really enjoy it.  Of course the best songs are &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Rollin'&quot; but there are two &quot;Rollin'&quot;'s on the CD.  One is the original and the other is one done with Method Man, Red-Man, and DMX.  That song also is very good.  Great CD.  A great purchase.  Well worth it.  You will love it if you like Limp Bizkit.

0395389496|5.0|It is far too easy to express cynicism about Christmas. Likewise, it is far too easy to put down the Christmas season as too commercial. And it is far too easy to dismiss a seasonal gem such as The Polar Express as simplistic and sentimental. But this tale is one of belief, of keeping something which is childlike, not childish, and that just doesn't grow old.<br />The narrator, a boy, lies awake listening for the sound of the bells on Santa's sleigh, a sound a friend who doesn't believe in Santa Claus says that he won't hear. Indeed, he does not, but what he does hear is even more wonderful and remarkable. He hears the hiss of steam and the squeak of metal, and when he looks out the window, he sees a train outside his house. It is the Polar Express, heading for the North Pole.<br />Once aboard, he finds that it is full of children, all in their nightclothes. They sing Christmas carols, drink cocoa and eat candies as the train races northward. Finally, they arrive at the North Pole, and the narrator is selected to receive the first gift of Christmas. He asks for, and receives from Santa Claus himself, a silver bell from the sleigh.<br />Although the boy loses the bell on the way home, kindly Santa returns it to him, and the boy discovers that the bell has a remarkable quality. Only those who still believe in the wonder of Santa and the spirit of Christmas can hear the bell. His friends and his sister eventually cannot hear the bell, but even when he grows up &quot;the bell still rings for [him] as it does for all who truly believe.&quot;<br />The story is accompanied by beautiful pictures that capture the nighttime journey. The author employs somber tones in most of his scenes, speckled with snow and highlighted with starlight and the glowing lights of the train. He captures the cold and mystery of the night, contrasting it with the warm interior scenes.<br />Every child should own this book. It is a magical story that they can appreciate for the rest of their lives.s.
B00004XONN|5.0|it makes me ill to read reviews that say &quot;this is not radiohead,&quot; &quot;this is not music,&quot; or perhaps the worst of all, someone telling radiohead that &quot;they are a rock band, and they should stick with that.&quot; what right do you have to say things like that? radiohead does not make music for people with narrow minds. since when has there been boundaries set on what is and is not music? this album is beautifully haunting from start to finish. it is not like anything they've done before, but this is what makes music so special. if you want the same music on every album, don't listen to radiohead, you will be disappointed. and by the way, if this was not radiohead i would still LOVE this cd. so go out and by this cd. and here's a suggestion, listen to this with headphones on. have an open mind and enjoy.
B00004TH6O|5.0|having put up with the likes of korn and limp bizkit (limp!) i discovered this album, which is startling in every song, especially quick and to the pointless, featuring spectacular vocals- i think he's called nick eldorado that sings. this is the first proper rock release of 2000, except iron maiden's latest album- graetness.
B00004YKUX|5.0|Cash delivers perhaps the most soulful, moving set of his career complete with clean, simple acoustic backup.  The rebellious &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot; will touch a familiar chord inside most listeners.  The tragicomic &quot;Nobody&quot; summarizes, in a few concise stanzas, the existential loneliness most of us feel in a world where too much is changing too fast.  &quot;Before My Time&quot; and &quot;Wayfaring Sranger&quot; are both breathtaking.  Contrary to some early reviews I've read, Cash's voice has changed since his last solo outing.  There is just a hint of frailty to the voice, and the occasional reaching for notes, but that only amplifies the material he has so ingeniously assembled here.  I am neither a die-hard country listener nor a serious fan of Johnny Cash, yet I would include this album on my &quot;desert island&quot; list. It's a masterpiece, and a steal at any price.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|sitting here and not rushing out and buying this album? well, the first time i heard this was at christmas 99. my brother took his cds to our house and allowed me to listen to them- well, listening to this i came to the conclusion that this is the greatest music ever recorded in the world, well to see reviews of individual songs you may look elsewhere, but you shouldn't still be sitting at your computer having read this review, but buying this classic album.
073660314X|4.0|I'm a long time fan of classic creature features. I grew up on the stuff. Saturday Monster Theater, my hometown station called it. Every Saturday afternoon at 2pm you could find me rooted two feet from the television, rods and cones soaking in the black and white flickering images of mummies and werewolves and monsters and creatures from boggy swamps. It was a genuine passion that resulted in many nightmares and a heightened imagination (and, I like to think, a warped sense of humor). One of my favorites was Frankenstein. The creature embodied the spirit of the boogey man that strode leisurely through my dreams while I ran against Jupiter's gravity. I watched it every time it played. I was around six before my dad told me that Frankenstein wasn't the monster's name. That is not truly the case in Shelley's novel - the monster moniker fits well on several characters. Hers is not the kind of gritty fright you get from The Evil Dead or the kind of nerve-fraying suspense Scream offered. In fact, it is a novel in the truest sense. It was written nearly 200 years ago in a time when it took writers years to perfect a masterpiece. It was crafted in an age when stories were told around campfires and not on the brain-sucking portal to the mindless world of programming directors and slathering yes-men. It is not concise and if you're looking for a relaxing, fast paced read to pass an afternoon, then you can stop reading now because this tome has meat. I do not believe in revealing plot in a review, so suffice it to say that this is a novel of love, obsession, vengeance and ignorance. It burrows into the psychology of a man and a \\"wretched creature\\" and you'll be surprised at what turns up. Though the most common school of thought seems to be that this novel is a twisted analogy of God and man, creator and creation, I believe it is almost a testimony against prejudice. I'm not a Shelley scholar, but this screams from the pages louder than Mae Clark from our Zenith console twenty-five years ago. A slighter lesson is that, if we confront our demons too late, we hurt the ones we love.  But it is truly the story and not any theme or correlating allegory that makes this a novel worth reading. For me, it's always the story. And I will reveal none of this one here. I will say that there is no Boris Karloff lurking behind a tree within Shelley's romantically articulated pages. If you're looking for a literary companion to your childhood memories of the black and white horror staples, you won't find it here. But you're apt to find a lot more.-five years ago.

B000001FDQ|5.0|My dad had a copy of an old Star Licks instructional video with Wolf Marshall playing licks in the style of someone called Yngwie Malmsteen.  Who?  Anyway, years later, I happened upon a Yng CD at a flea market.<br />WOW.  It was the Yngwie Malmsteen Collection, but the two songs that stuck out were Black Star and Far Beyond the Sun.  Upon seeing that both of them were from Rising Force, and hearing all over that it was his best CD, I went out and bought it.  Icarus' Dream Suite is one of the most beautiful contemporary songs ever written, and every song on the CD showcases unparalleled technical skill on his scalloped Fender Strat.  It's one of those CDs you listen to over and over and never get tired of it.<br />Since then, I've bought more than a half a dozen Yng CDs and videos and never looked back, but Rising Force is his penultimate classical-arpeggio-over-heavy-chord-riff CD, and I suggest you buy it if you're a guitar or keyboard player, a classical or metal fan, or if you just want a change from the normal pentatonic riffs.

B000000WFF|3.0|What was it that Entertainment Weekly called them?  &quot;Disposable Entertainment at it's Finest.&quot;  I couldn't have said it better.<br />   Yes, three or four, or maybe even two years ago, the Spice Girls were still &quot;good.&quot;  But, seeing as they haven't put out a chart topping album since '98, well . . . what can I say?  Believe me, this is NOT a rip on the Girls, (three years ago, I was the biggest Spice fan that you could find for miles) just that they haven't done anything in the last couple years except for sit on their butts and have babies.  Really, the &quot;spice&quot; left the group right along with Ginger.  <br />   I love most of the songs on this CD (except for 'Move Over' and 'Do It').  They're inspirational and have a nice beat.  The only problem that I have is that they tend to follow a repetitive pattern, which is almost like their trademark.  They should have switched producers for a couple of their songs to give em a new twist.       Overall, this CD is OK.  Not great, not bad, just, good to have in your collection.
B00004XOWM|5.0|this is the best limp bizkit cd. the best song is Rollin (Urban Assault Vehicle) it has Red &amp; Meth and DMX. But every song on here is da bomb. definetly worth the money.
068484267X|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I've read in a LONG time. It was refreshing to find a book that could keep my wandering mind and High School attention span in check. The trials of the Mc Court family were nothing to laugh at but I often found myself trying very hard to surppres laughter while reading in a classroom where you could easily hear a pin drop. The humerous sections were not based around the events that were taking place, but more around how Frank, as a child, viewed what was going on. The McCourt children knew very little of life and death. What they did know was taught to them by their drunken father and manic depressive mother. Frank seemed to have a slight grasp on the idea that once his younger siblings died he would never see them again, yet he still had many innocent questions. At a very young age Frank was questioning how death happened. He saw a dog get hit by a car and bleed to death. Later on he made another child bleed on the playground. Thinking that blood was death after seeing the dog die from it, Frank feared that he had killed his friend when in all actuality it was a minor injury. Later on in the novel when others take ill and die Frank questions why there was no blood and yet they died. The lack of knowledge and simple questions that Frank had as a child added a great deal to the novel. It was almost depressing when I realized that he would never get those questions answered and just keep wondering. While reading I found myself often forgetting that this was a true story and wondering how an author could come up with a plot line with this many twists and turns. All in all I LOVED this book. It earned each and every one of the five stars not only because it kept my attention for longer than humanly possibly, but because of the way McCourt took tragic events and somehow made the reader believe that for a split second something comical was going on.
B0000507UD|5.0|If you're into rap or into hard rock, this CD is great. Rolling and My Generation are probably the best songs on it.
B0000025DV|5.0|. . . and into the realm of, well, damned good pop music.  This is a true story:  I was a snot-nosed little Yes fan in the late 70s, but now and then I'd lower myself to something as vulgar as an ELO concert &quot;just for something to do tonight.&quot;   When this tour came to town, I had heard about the plastic flying saucer stage, and I have to admit, that kind of gave a me an attitude going in.   And (this is the fun, hard-to-believe part)-- I had actual front row center seats (radio industry connection gave 'em to me.)  Despite the in-your-face-oh-wow effect, I was pretty bored by the over-the-top, yet coldly overproduced show.  (Shame, too, because I really liked their &quot;New World Record&quot; and &quot;Face The Music&quot; tours.)  A decent show, I suppose, but probably I was too stupid and whiney to enjoy it.<br />Flash forward 20+ years:  (Another true story) -- I had purchased every cd I that I legitimately wanted, and found myself bored in a cd store.  &quot;Hmmmm.  Let's pick the worst, most bad taste cd we can think of, and go home and laugh at it.&quot;  Mean, no?   Here's the fun part:  I bought &quot;Out of the Blue,&quot; took it home, played it, and immediately LOVED IT!   I proceeded to go out and buy almost every cd in ELO's backlog (all of them from their second album to &quot;Balance of Power,&quot;) and there's really something great going on here.  Time has been very, very kind. [And their album &quot;Time&quot; is quite fun, too.] Two months later this showed up in Q Magazine's &quot;What We're Listening To,&quot; column. Could it be that ELO is becoming hip again?  Honestly, do yourself a favor.  Buy now.  It's like eating a can of chocolate frosting in one sitting.  A genuine, delicious guilty pleasure.  PS:  This pressing needs remastering desperately.  The cheapo packaging kind of sucks, too.  If anyone knows of a Masterdisk cd pressing for sale, or a remastered version, please e-mail me.   Hope you enjoy this disc as much as I do!
6304578482|4.0|Okay, it doesn't matter that I've seen this movie at least 36 times, I never get tired of plugging it.<br />Romy and Michele are invited to their 10-year High School Reunion.  But when they start filling out their questionnaire (&quot;They want to know what we've been doing for the past ten years.&quot;) they realize their lives aren't all that glamorous after all.  So they devise a little scheme, making up a story involving the invention (and design!) of Post-It Notes.  Thus spawns the great debate: Who's the Mary and who's the Rhoda.<br />Of course nothing goes according to plan, and the two decide to part ways once they arrive at their reunion back at Sagebrush High in Tucson, Arizona (&quot;This town is, like, so unhip!&quot;  &quot;Oh, I know!&quot;)<br />Despite the lengthy dream sequence in the middle of the movie, it made me wonder which group I belonged to in High School.  Definitely not the A group.  Lisa Kudrow was made to play Michele, the half-wit blonde with a heart of gold.  Mira Sorvino was just as convincing as her best friend forever, Romy.  The two could only be upstaged by the inimitable Janeane Garofalo.  Throw in the perky Toby Walters (played to a &quot;T&quot; by Camryn Manheim) and Alan Cumming as the &quot;pocket-protector&quot; geek who constantly lusts after Michele and you have one cute story.<br />Of course, no matter how much I like this film, the cheesy dance sequence towards the end always makes me cringe.  But it's still cute nevertheless.  When I want to reminisce of my own 80's high school days, I'll pop in this video and wax nostalgic.
6300213714|5.0|Walter Hill ( \\"48 Hrs\\", \\"Hard Times\\", \\"Extreme Prejudice\\" ) shows his directing flair for action, drama and style in this crackling 1979 movie about a Coney Island gang falsely accused of murder and fleeing from their accusers....the other NYC gangs and the New York City Police Department.     Hill successfully adapted to the screen the moderately popular novel by author Sol Yurick who worked with the NYC Dept of Welfare in the 1950's. Yurick used the basis of ancient Greek history and the torturous trek home by Greek soldiers after their leader , Cyrus the Younger, was killed in the Persian Wars...and simply updated the setting to modern day NY and it's raging gang warfare embracing the five boroughs !     Set amongst a hostile, nocturnal world of neon lit train stations, baseball bat wielding gang members and lethal, gun toting women \\"The Warriors\\" moves along at a frenetic pace with a fine selection of young actors taking the lead. Michael Beck plays the cool headed, war chief \\"Swan\\", seeking to get the other members back home to Coney Island alive and in one piece. James Remar is unforgettable as the woman chasing, hot headed \\"Ajax\\"...always out to prove his manhood with his fists. And David Patrick Kelly is perfect as the murderous, but cowardly leader of the Rogues.     Attending a combined meeting of dozens of street gangs deep in the South Bronx to hear the Gramercy Riffs plans to control the streets of New York, the Warriors are wrongly accused of the shooting death of their charismatic leader, \\"Cyrus\\". The finger of blame pointed their way, they flee via any means they can and upon their way back to home base encounter violent opposition from the low life \\"Orphans\\", the shaven headed \\"Turnbull AC's\\", the face painted \\"Baseball Furies\\", the seductive all female gang, the \\"Lizzies\\" and even rifts within their own ranks lead to trouble.     The film was roundly savaged by several sections of the community (mainly law enforcement & welfare groups) upon it's release for apparently inciting gang violence and it's poor depiction of inner city street kids, and yes, there were several nasty incidents at theatre's upon the film's release, but these have been blown well out of all proportion. Although, I must say when the film was released in my country (Australia) it was already riding a wave of notoriety, and attracted \\"bad boys\\" in their droves to watch this \\"infamous\\" gang flick. When viewed in the cold light of day, the film is actually fairly cartoon like in it's depiction of urban violence and most anyone who receives a beating seems to be left just rubbing their head and moaning ( think Sylvester the Cat ) in discomfort !     Actor Thomas G. Waites who played the Warriors gang member \\"Fox\\", disagreed with the script and effectively walked out in mid-production, so a grip doubled for Waites in several scenes and Waites' name was removed from the final credits. Additionally, the \\"Fox\\" character's fate was re-written to have him die in the film after being hurled in front of a subway train.    Interestingly, out of a on screen line up of promising young talent, very few of the cast went on to any real major fame & fortune in Hollywood. Lead actor Michael Beck (Swan) went on to appear next in the sugary \\"Xanadu\\" with Olivia Newton-John, and by his own admission, it was not a great career move, and his film career unfortunately never really flourished. James Remar (Ajax) has easily experienced the most success (with about 70 feature film's under his belt) and he has continued his motif of tough, aggressive leads in films like \\"48 Hrs\\", and plenty of \\"straight to video\\" action fare...plus Remar even crops up regularly on \\"Sex and the City\\" & \\"Third Watch\\" re-runs ! (It's good to see that hard hitting \\"Ajax\\" never left New York.) And the terrific David Patrick Kelly has kept busy, usually in other sinister, criminal roles...check out his performances in \\"Commando\\", \\"The Crow\\" & \\"Wild at Heart\\" !   Sadly, young actor MarcellinoSanchez who played graffiti artist \\"Rembrandt\\" died from cancer only a few years after the films release.    The recently released \\"Ultimate Directors Cut\\" of this cult classic has several superb extras. Apart from an introduction from director Walter Hill, and some interconnecting comic panel art between sequences in the feature, the DVD has four mini featurettes chock full of interviews with key cast members and production staff discussing key sequences in the film, plus the phenomenal cult following that has developed for \\"The Warriors\\".    A colorful, exciting and fast paced film...albeit corny in places with that silly love story sub plot with bee stung lipped, Deborah Van Valkenbergh...\\"The Warriors\\" is a bona fide cult film with a legion of fans across the globe.

B00004YKUX|3.0|This disc is a disappointment when compared to Cash's previous two American releases. American 1 was stark, hard, and a near perfect artistic achievment. American II (Unchained) was lighter fare but contained some dynamite cover songs like Rusty Cage and Beck's Rowboat. On American III, Cash's originals are fairly weak and in the case of, I'm Leavin' Now, and Country Trash, just bad. At his worst Cash sounds like he's doing his take on those William Shatner commercials (see track 5- Nobody). I believe this is due to poor song selection. Johnny Cash is one great interpreter of songs and there are some excellent examples here. Track 6- I See A Darkness, is as good as anything I have heard him sing. The Mercy Seat is powerful; and his cover of U2's One is quite good. From the opening song, Tom Petty's I Wont Back Down, it is obvious that his voice can still haunt. But while Solitary Man may have seemed like a cool title for the disc and a good description of Cash's legendary persona, the actual song of that name by Neil Diamond (!!) is beneath a talent like Cash's.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas' debut album, &quot;Illmatic&quot;, is undoubtedly a contender for the greatest rap album of all time.  This Queens prodigy's superior lyrical flow is clearly evident from the head bopping &quot;NY State of Mind&quot; to the smooth, laid back &quot;It Ain't Hard to Tell&quot;.  &quot;Illmatic&quot; is one of those unique albums that you can listen straight through and not have to hit the fast forward button once, a rarity in this day and age of suspect rap albums from even more suspect MCs. Definitely a hip-hop masterpiece, definitely ILLMATIC.                                                          JD
B00004XOWM|5.0|Really cool. I prefer track 2, it is cool.
B00004XOWM|4.0|I had never bought a limp bizkit cd before but i had heard their two previous albums.  They had some good songs on them but they also had their not-so-good ones.  Their new cd, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, is quite similar in that respect.  It has a few really good songs, like Rollin', My Generation, etc. (the ones heard on the radio...) but there are also those songs where, after lisining to them, you ask yourself, &quot;hmmmm...that was strange....&quot;  There is also a much more prominent rap presence on this cd.  So I'd have to say, overall, this cd is definately worth buying, even if it is only just for the good songs.....
B00004XOWM|5.0|Yo, this CD just blows all other CD's outta the water.  Every song on here is awesome.  From the hardcore sound of &quot;Boiler&quot; on to the fresh beats of songs like &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot;, you can't listen to em just once. Combining rock, hip-hop, rap, Limp Bizkit is definitely the best band out there.  If you liked Three Dollar Bill Y'all and Significant Other, you will absolutely love The Chocolate Starfish and The Hotdog Flavored Water.  Get this CD!
B00004XOWM|3.0|Limp Bizkit's new cd is nothing to be to proud of.They have gone towards being more of a rap band then a metal band.If you are true fan you will buy and not like it as much as the others.But for a first time buyer of this band I would not advise you to buy this record.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Limp bizkit must have made this cd in between bathroom breaks at their local pancake house.This cd is appropriatly named,Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog flavored water, because of Fred Durst fondness for beach side cook outs.CS and HGW shows limp bizkits sad descent into the WORLD OF MUSIC NO ONE CARES ABOUT. Let us pray that they realize this and go away forever so people that won't listen to their &quot;watered down rap rock&quot; don't have to hear the 7 yr old LB fans crying over the new LB cd they bought with their bubble gum money.
B000002UEB|5.0|Looking back at my 10 years of listening to metal, this is one of the best examples how great this genre can be. This album was a big punch for all those stereotypical thinkers that metal was aggressive genre without big musical importance. They also thought that it was a good field for gold digging by musicians with no-talent. My answer to them, look at music business nowadays. They were dead wrong. They never listened to \\"Operation Mindcrime\\", \\"Seventh Son...\\", \\"Master Of Puppets\\", \\"Images And Words\\", \\"Dusk And Her Embrace\\", \\"Into The Nightside Eclipse\\", \\"Countdown To Extinction\\", \\"Heartwork\\" and countless other examples of pure musical ecstasy.<br />I always liked concept albums but there are few bands that can do it, and do it right (Grave Digger and similar silly bands are out of question). This album, Savatage's \\"Streets\\", latest DT's \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" and Opeth's \\"My Arms, your Hearse\\" are one of the best concept masterpieces. I think that important role is to catch listener's attention with storyline but to have songs that can stand alone.<br />What can I say about \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" which wasn't already said? One of the best dual-solo work, great vocal harmonies, great storyline that shows how intelligent is this band... anything on this album is done great.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Now I will make this sweet and short.  This CD has loads of swearing (parents, if your kid wants this CD get the edited version) which sometimes makes a song better or kills it.  The best song has to be Rollin' (Urban Assault Vehicle) since the song features Limp Bizkit and also DMX, Redman, and Method Man.  All these songs will &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; all night long with it's sweet guitar, bass, precussion, record scratches, and it's kick[ing] vocals.
0060925000|1.0|I am sorry but after reading all those praises about this book i could not resist. I think that this book is totally crap and if u read it u might think in the end..&quot;What the hell?&quot; The book is long..and when i say that i mean it. It portrays 30 characters and they are all one worser than the previous one. DO NOT READ IT. I WASTED 2 and a half weeks on it and i could have read something more decent in that time. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! MAKE BETTER USE OF IT!!
6301640659|4.0|First I want to say that any film that affects you either in a negative or positive manner,is probably a film worth mulling over.  As a police film this film is extremely effective in making you feel how deep and how personal an undercover investigation can be.  As a representation of a portion of the gay population of that time it is set an a convincing style. An any manner if you are a Pacino film enthusiast, this film is a must. His sullen character is convincing and will definately leave you with a &quot;what the hell?&quot;
B00003CX7L|5.0|This is a winner. As well as the old characters, there is now the puppy (who Woody has complete control over), Evil Emporer Zurg (you'll have to watch it to see how he turns out), and of course, the Barbie dolls. First seen in a Heffner Mansion style party situation, these chics really know how to party.<br />Kelsey Grammar is great as Stinky Pete, and Jesse and Bullseye fill the rest of the team. I was ready to cry when Jesse told her story. <br />I particularly liked the references to Star Wars, and the visual teasers of Jurrasic Park. There are probably a ton that I missed.<br />It is better than the original.
0767802659|2.0|Having read the book several times by Mr. Heinlein, I must admit that this movie is an absolute FLOP! It states that it is based on the book, and that is about as far as it goes.  I sincerely hope that Mr. Heinlein did not roll over in his grave when this travesty was released.<br />Sure, the computer graphics were stupendous! That is why I have given it 2 stars. Even that is being generous. It seems that the producers spent all of the money on the graphics and then realised that they still had to outfit all of the &quot;troopers&quot;.  The troopers armor was about as advanced as the what the US Army used in Vietnam; Flak Jacket and Helmet.  The book is all about the very advanced, powered-armor that the Mobile Infantry used in combat and the exacting, grueling training that the individual had to endure just to become qualified in using said armor.  <br />The Mobile Infantry was the heart of the novel, whereas they were a &quot;leftover&quot; in the movie. Also in the book, the &quot;Bugs&quot; were technologically advanced, having starships, missiles, etc..<br />If the producers would have spent more effort on the capabilities of the Mobile Infantry and not squandered most of the effort on the &quot;bugs&quot;, this could have been a supurb movie.<br />As far as the &quot;Totalitarian State&quot; goes, once again the book is different.  The movie made humanity seem like the &quot;bad guys&quot;.<br />In the book, to be eligible to vote, one had to have served his country/nation by serving in the military or other type of public/government service.  The reasoning behind this, is that the veteran has &quot;earned&quot; the right to vote, and would be more reluctant to use military power for political means.  I actually think that the idea has merit. (You have to read the book to understand why.)<br />This movie is a prime example of &quot;See the movie BEFORE you read the book.&quot;  Once you have read the book, you'll probably throw the movie away if you already have it.  Sorry about the long review, but this movie really got my goat after reading one of the classics of science-fiction lierature.
B00003CWTI|1.0|This movie is absolutely perfect.....perfectly awful. After sitting through three hours of watching this train-wreck of a film, I contemplated taking legal action against the studio for abuse. I had high expectations going into this film because I enjoyed Paul Thomas Anderson's last effort in 1997's &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. In this movie, he tries too hard to be Robert Altman. The lives of different characters slowly intertwine as the movie unfolds. The problem is that the characters are so unlikable and unsavory that you can't help but hope that they all would be killed in the end. The only saving element is the oscar-nominated performance of Tom Cruise. His character (Frank &quot;T.J.&quot; Mackey) is a laughable self-help guru for men. It is only during his scenes that the movie comes alive. His testosterone-fuelled speeches at an all-male convention are the best. Unfortunately, he is only on screen for a total of twenty minutes. If you feel compelled to rent or buy this DVD, just look for the Cruise scenes on the menu. Save yourself two and a half hours of agony and skip the rest of the movie.
B000006Z8E|5.0|This is excellent Prog Rock at it's best. For the longest time I only had the American &quot;Maticore&quot; release (now Japanese Import Only), till last year. I bought everything available, as you see by the selection their going out of print. Get yours while you can! You won't regret it. This is up to or better than many British Progressive Bands from the same era.
B00000K19E|5.0|Simply put: I love this movie.  With &quot;The Matrix&quot;, the Wachowski brothers have crossed stunning visuals with an imaginative and intelligent plot.  Clearly, they are influenced by John Woo, Jackie Chan, George Lucas as well as several graphic novel artists.  Each scene in the movie is framed like a cell from a comic book.  They even managed to make Keanu Reeves seem tough! Without a doubt, this is still my favorite movie from the last three years.   This DVD is excellent.  Warner Bros took full advantage of the 5.1 Dolby Digital format and you can hear the results with every playback.  There are a lot of extras including a &quot;Making of&quot; and interviews with the cast and directors.  I cannot wait to see the rest of the Matrix trilogy.  Hopefully, the Wachowskis won't keep us waiting too long.
6305078564|5.0|Can a miniseries based on an old book instigate friendships, inspire hobbies, and influence one's vocabulary?   It is a truth universally acknowledged!!! :o)  This adaptation has achieved cult-worship status online and beyond, evidenced by the birth and growth of a major Jane Austen discussion site originally conceived in its honor.  In the eight years between my first reading of Pride &amp; Prejudice and my first viewing of this wonderful adaptation, I built up a good many mental images as to what the characters should look like, how the scenes should be blocked out, and how the various locations should appear.  Amazingly enough, this miniseries duplicated almost PRECISELY every detail I'd imagined!  It really makes you fall in love with the story...whether you're an old P&amp;P fanatic or a complete Austen 'virgin,' you'll stay up all hours of the night to finish watching the whole thing!!!  Before long, you'll find yourself quoting the characters and using &quot;Austenspeak&quot; involuntarily!  On a more personal note, my obsession with this production got me involved with a myriad of other fans from all over the world, and reignited my latent Austen fascination.  It also got me interested in historical costuming and Regency history and dance.  Happy thought indeed!
B00003CWL6|5.0|When this movie was first released in theatres back in September of 1999, I shyed away from purchasing a ticket at the box office.  I had seen the reviews and was unimpressed.  Ironically, it starred Kevin Spacey who is among my favorite actors working today.  The subject matter (at first glance) seemed contrived in it's satirical look at modern day suburbia.  It seemed prime for a Sunday 8pm time slot on the Lifetime channel and not the big screen.   After seeing &quot;Magnolia&quot; (which I hated) in December later that year, I was in no hurry to see &quot;American Beauty&quot;.  The two films seemed all too similar in tone and dramatic content.  I was glad that I finally gave in earlier this year and rented this fine work by first time film director Sam Mendes.  Unlike &quot;Magnolia&quot;, this film has a discernible purpose: to give the audience a voyeuristic view into the life of Lester Burnham (Spacey) and the supporting players and draw similarities to how we view our own lives. The rest of the cast is suberb (especially Wes Bentley who steals every scene).  &quot;American Beauty&quot; is a poignant and powerful film which I highly recommend.
B00004XONN|5.0|There's nothing much to say but just... Outstanding.
B00004X01U|5.0|MADONNA - MUSIC (2000) - AN ESSENTIAL RECORDING<br />When Madonnaphiles heard 'American Pie' on the airwaves in 1999, many of them went ecstatic over her cover of Don McClean's classic. With William Orbit lending his trademark signature stamp to the production, it showed us that upcoming work from Madonna would be of the same impeccable quality.<br />A few months later, we all heard 'Paradise (Not for me)' which was the first ever collaboration between Madonna and Mirwais, virtually unknown even in his homeland France (indeed, even French clubbers have admitted to no knowledge of Mirwais pre-'Paradise'). Admittedly, this was a fresh new Madonna to many of us. Just when we all thought that she couldn't possibly do something original, she stunned both her critics and fans with a song, that could quite possibly, be her weirdest yet.<br />In June 2000, bootleg copies of Madonna's new single 'Music' were leaked to the Net, and Madonna's constant delay in releasing the CD single will most likely hinder her chances of a Number One Single. The song itself is no 'Paradise', though it IS produced by Mirwais. Accompanied by an astonishingly unimpressive video, 'Music' the single does attempt to incorporate new-age synthesizer sounds and voice-morph into the traditional club trance rhythm routine, and it succeeds to an extent. The lyrics, though, are at best juvenile, and hardly worth noting. Inspite of that, 'Music' seems to have captured the interest of even non-Madonna fans, with its incredibly catchy opening lines : 'Hey Mr. DJ......' - we all know the rest by this time.<br />In August 2000, a full month before the release of her next album 'Music', the entire collection appeared on the Net, first at Napster, and then at various other download sites. Heres what I thought of it.<br />'Impressive Instant' - Very William Orbit, and a cosmotechno secondtrack that is bound to become a big discotheque hit. Madonna's voice on this track is modulated to various degrees, with great effect. Some absurd lyrics are carried off with great style, and Madonna amazes once again.<br />'I Deserve It' - This is one of my favorite tracks on the album, just because Madonna explores country terrain, with mature and soulful lyrics. Mirwais shows us that hes not just good with the synthesizer, and that he can come up with a classy ballad if he wants to. An excellent song, that would no doubt be a hit in rural America as well as anywhere else. Like the other songs on this album, this track stands out for its repeat value, and its ability to draw you into singing along. Beautiful.<br />'Amazing' - This is the song I least liked on the new album. It obviously owes its roots and heart to 'Beautiful Stranger' and it appears that Orbit has run out of ideas. Whatever happened to originality? Its so uninspired, and looks very rushed. I only hope they dont release this as a single!<br />'Runaway Lover' - Alright, so there HAD to be a followup to the 'Ray of Light' Single, I guess, and this is it! Very funky, very danceable, and very genre-defying. She could have worked harder on the lyrics, though. At times, it sounds like Madonnas trapped in her 'Erotica' days, but she should remember that that was more than eight years ago!<br />'Nobody's Perfect' - I would call this the finest Madonna song ever recorded. Mirwais does an excellent and spellbinding job of transmogrifying Madonna's voice into a heartstopping wail that sounds almost ghostly. It is utterly bewitching and indescribably beautiful, all rolled into one. If theres something that Madonna has to be proud of on this album, its this song. The words, the music (you'll LOVE the way Mirwais holds the song together and links it up) and her voice all sound incredible and original. The best thing on 'Music'.<br />'Don't Tell Me' - This song reminded me of 'Secret', perhaps its due to the wonderful beat at the back. The lyrics are VERY nice, and so is the melody. Midway through the song, you tire of it, and wait for it to wind up. But soon after, you find yourself humming it and wanting to play it over and over again. I think thats the sign of a really good pop song, and this one IS !<br />'What it feels like for a Girl' - There has been talk that this single will not augur well as the second single from 'Music'. I agree, as its rather dreary upon first listening, but WAIT!  Play this one innumerably and chances are that you'll fall in love with it. I say that this one is the most lyrically lush track on 'Music'. And the opening riff, spoken, is touching. It should make for a great video, though I cant ever imagine boogeying to the remix versions!<br />'Paradise' - Sure, its old now, but I'll never forget the effect this song had on me the first time I heard it! I almost froze when I heard the 'Alien' part come on - Madonna says 'There is a light above my head' as if shes straight out of the X-Files. Weird, and VERY enticing. What a track! For those of you wondering what the French bit is, the translation is thus : 'All around me, I could not see, who the angels were, Surely not me! Yet once again, I am destroyed, yet once again, I do not believe'. I may have got my tenses wrong , but thats really what shes saying. Her first ever French on a record ever!<br />'Gone' - I didn't care too much for this at first, but now its one of my favorites. This single will be the last track on the US version of the CD (Japan will have 'Cyberraga', a song that Madonna has recorded with Indian musician Talvin Singh) and Europe will see 'American Pie' close the set (groan! ). Its a mature song, and though it isn't a musical masterpiece, it does show us a grown up and content Madonna, and you then feel all warm and comfy inside yourself!<br />Thats it!...An EXCELLENT album, and the ultimate pop masterpiece.<br />Kabir Ahamedit to wind up.

B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is one of those movies that doesn't just stun and amaze you, but adds something significant to its genre.  In Gladiator's case, it's in the action scenes.  Most action movies try to slow down the action (Braveheart, The 13th Warrior, etc.) for at least some of the battle scenes.  Not Gladiator.  Oh no.  Gladiator does the opposite.  Along with some camera techniques that I can't begin to describe, this makes for possibly the most visceral and engaging action sequences since, well, Seven Samurai.          As for the story, it is surprisingly well done, and while many discredit the movie for its &quot;historical inaccuracy,&quot; it is sure a whole lot more historically accurate than say, The Patriot.          Actors are generally strong from the indomitable, electrifying Crowe to the loasthome yet, admittedly, effective Phoenix.  A broad range of realistic characters is well represented here.  The musical score is stirring, ominous, and, when necessary, complements the action very nicely.  At over two and a half hours, this is one movie that really takes advantage of its length (seven battles makes for a long movie and a whole lot of head-lopping).          Not for the faint of heart.  Certainly for just about anyone else.  Definitely for those who have been starved for some really engaging swords-and-axes-and-arrows combat.  <br />    But why am I wasting my time writing this?  Gladiator can be described in three words: SEE IT NOW.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This cd is perfect. It balances the different influences of Limp Bizkit's music perfectly. The Hard-hitting heavy rap-metal style of Limp Bizkit's &quot;3 Dollar Bill,Y'all&quot; days is here as well as the refined smooth style that  took up most of &quot;Significant Other&quot; also present is straight out rap in &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; (with guest Xzibit), a long well composed rock song &quot;Hold On&quot; featuring Scott Weiland from The Stone Temple Pilots, and a bass-pumping rap version of the Single &quot;Rollin' &quot;, perfect for the system in your car, with appearances by DMX, Method Man, Redman and produced by Swizz Beatz of Ruff Ryders fame. With an  original intro and outro and an intresting cover by none other than Wes Borland. I think everyone should have this cd but that's just my opinion, the bottom line is you always have a choice.
B00003CXGP|4.0|American Psycho left the same impression on me that The Talented Mr. Ripley did; An unsatisfying or unfulfilled ending. It is not necessarily that I expected for Bateman to get his upcommance.Maybe I just missed the powerful subtlety of the climax of the film itself. Christian Bale is an excellent actor who must have had some kind of personal chuckle imitating an uptight, arrogant, wall-street American yuppie. Even his &quot;American&quot; accent was flawless !He played a character that you really not only hated for his literal cutthroat antics but for his annoying behavior and obessession as a neat freak !Yet, there appeared to be times in the story where his &quot;sickness&quot; was also a cry for help...like a rabid or diseased dog waiting to be caught and put out of it's misery. Bale gets 5 stars for his stellar performance.<br />My understanding of the film was that it was a twisted/dark satirical comedy coinciding with a slasher/thriller movie (sort of like a recording artist ala Sarah Brightman singing opera while on the next track singing a pop ballad all on the same album); Different genres within the same context or realm. It was not just about a nutcase hacking people, but it was also a social commentary about commercialism, consumerism, and capitalism (the &quot;holy trintiy&quot; of Wall Street and upper class America)!<br />This film falls under the category of &quot;eclectic and off-beat&quot;. While it sports all the glamor and typical nuance of a Hollywood big budget film it also serves well as an art house independent film for the Cannes Film Festival !
B00004XOWM|5.0|Fred Durst and Company have done it again!  This album is much better than previous releases.  There's plently of rock and also some hip-hop flava that will satisfy the cravings for all limp bizkit fans.<br />My fave track is &quot;Hot Dog.&quot;  The chorus is so funny!  Keep on rockin guys!
B00000DQSS|5.0|This is truly one of my favorite of her albums, and I've heard them all.  It's worth it to have the whole album for the strange and haunting Infant Kiss, which is told from the perspective of a confounded nanny who is attracted to one of the young children she cares for, who is possessed by a grown man (This is from a movie that Kate saw, French I believe, but I don't know the title).  &quot;I say goodnight tonight/I tuck him in tight/But things are not right/What is this infant kiss that sends my body tingling?&quot;  Just Kate and the piano, but wow at those harmonics.  She's really a genius.<br />There's tremendous range on this album.  Babooshka and Violin are cantankerous and energetic.  Delius and Army Dreamers are steeped in music, and soft.  Irony, beauty, complexity, texture...it's all here.<br />Very deep, ready to be listened to hundreds of times.  Absolutely worth it!!!
0140177396|1.0|I know a lot of people are going to be mad at me for saying that I HATE this book, which is why I have decided to leave this anonymous. Anyway, it's probably just a personal thing.  It was very boring.  The fact that I had to read it for my english class and write an essay about it probably didn't help, but I NEVER would have read this on my own. The writing isn't even that great.  And the only reason people like it is because it's a classic.  And the only reason it's a classic is because you've been TOLD it's a classic!  It's an old book, and it has some theme and deep symbolic meaning, blah blah blah.  But if you actually want a good book, I don't suggest this one.  If you have to read this for your english class, I feel sorry for you.
B0000507UD|5.0|hey listerners!!! this is the best limp bizkit cd ever. Not only the single take a look around and my generation are rapcore monuments, the whole cd rocks. Sometimes a hip hop title like getcha groove on, or the very unussal limp bizkit ballad hold on. 15 tracks including intro and outro make this record a 75 min. long cd, so buy it.
B000002UB3|5.0|Admittedly, Abbey Road is not my favorite Beatles album; in fact, it barely makes my top five list.  But it still gets five stars because, well, they are the Beatles after all, and there are some great songs on here.  Numbers like &quot;Come Together,&quot; &quot;Because,&quot; &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money,&quot; and &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; stand out as some of the finest work the Beatles have ever done.  On the other hand, McCartneys bouncy but boring (&quot;granny music,&quot; as Lennon would say) &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer,&quot; Ringo's simplistic &quot;Octopus's Garden,&quot; and Lennon's contributions to the side two medley aren't particularly outstanding.  Simply stated, this album has weak links, moreso than Rubber Soul, Revolver, and Sgt. Pepper. That being said, this album benefits from two of the greatest songs the Beatles ever wrote, and they were written by none other than George Harrison.  &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; are classics that, in my humble opinion, eclipse anything that Lennon and McCartney wrote for this album.     So to sum up:  if you're looking for an introduction to the Beatles, try Rubber Soul, Revolver, or Sgt. Pepper.  But if you are a Beatles fan and this is not in your collection, it's definitely worth your time and money.
B00003CXE7|2.0|Five stars,  five stars,  five stars... yeah, yeah, sure.    GLADIATOR is as over-rated a movie as was released this year. While it's no BLAIR WITCH PROJECT in that respect, it still gets an insane amount of praise for so ordinary an effort.<br />Yes, Russell Crowe is magnetic (and I guess if you're inclined in that direction, sexy and hunky) and Ridley Scott can still pull off his usual hat tricks (he remains the best director making bad films in the business) but really, this is a hollow effort.<br />But, yes, the gladiatorial scenes are a sight to behold.  No doubt about it, Scott is a visual master and the combat scenes are intense and rousing.  If only the rest of the film were as vital and entertaining.  It's not just that we've seen it all before a million times, it's that it is so so ordinary about the whole thing.  The critics grousing about PHANTOM MENACE should have been doing double duty here and I bet they weren't.<br />So, for sure, if you haven't seen GLADIATOR yet, rent it, but buy it only if you, for some silly reason, really love it.  <br />If you are looking for some great action scenes and rousing conflict on the field of battle, this is a place to look.  But, if you also want to see a great film to go along with it, I think you need to look elswhere.   <br />Thanks for your time people.
0767812417|5.0|I must say, I've never really been a big fan of musicals perse, but four years ago, I caught this delightful rendition of the Charles Dickens classic on the ENCORE movie network and I instantly changed my tune. I love movies, and I have always loved movies, but I never got so much enjoyment out of watching a film in my life until I saw OLIVER!. It's &quot;freely&quot; adapted from the Dickens novel, and there's the inclusion of song and dance, but the film still manages to stay fairly close to its source, and the entire production is successful at capturing the mood of 19th-century England, and the spirit of Dickens' original novel is alive throughout. Those not familiar with the story, OLIVER is the tale of a little orphan boy whose life has been nothing but workhouse servitude. When he finally escapes from his turbulent and unhappy life, he falls in with a band of young thieves led by the incorrigible Fagin(Ron Moody, Oscar-nominated). British child actor Mark Lester is appealing and absolutely adorable in the title role. Jack Wild(Oscar-nominated) is equally winning as his slick sidekick, The Artful Dodger. In fact, Lester and Wild worked so well together in the film that they went on to appear together in the popular 1971 release MELODY. Oliver Reed is appropriately menacing as the brutish Bill Sykes. The film was directed by Reed's uncle, Carol Reed. Some might say this film compares in comparison to David Lean's straight-faced 1948 filmization of the Dickens classic. That version of the story is also a confirmed classic, but it's not nearly as much fun as this one. If you're a parent and want to introduce your children to the classics, this film is the way to do it!
B000022TSF|5.0|i've read a lot of customer reviews saying that they didn't like the movie, it was overrated, and the ending was lame.  I disagree disagree disagree!  i read a review saying something like &quot;why was it even called chinatown, it wasn't about chinatown?&quot;<br />this is simple.  the story is about jake gittes.  jake gittes saw some horrible things while working in chinatown; what he saw and participated in while working in chinatown contributes heavily to what he does in the film, and also his reactions to what happens around him.  this is a guy who was forced to sit back and allow things to happen before, and he'll be damned if he lets that happen now.  the ending is not horrible.  the ending is perfect.  look at the symmetry to it...this horrible bloody end occurs IN CHINATOWN, of all places.<br />as for &quot;overrated&quot;...that's a horrible word.  how can something be &quot;overrated&quot;?  whether you like a movie or not should be based on what you bring to it.  if you don't like it, you don't like it.  you're not going to see why other people do like it.  chinatown is a fine film, and the dvd transfer isn't too bad.  i'd like to see it on a better transfer; it's not even a cut above the vhs transfer, but such is life.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is the best cohesive effort that Pink Floyd put together after their founder went bonkers.  Animals blends all of the best elements of the post-Syd Floyd.  Waters is in a most cynical mood as he addresses the issues of classism, government, and oppression.  Gilmour's playing is simple but inspired.  Wright's keyboards (as usual) are overlooked but essential to holding this work together.  Mason is more than adequate on the drum kit.  The songs are long, Dogs clocks in at over 17 minutes and Pigs(Three Different Ones) and Sheep come in over 12 minutes a piece.  Dogs is really the heart of the album and is an amazing work, dare I say Waters shining moment.  Pigs on the Wing Pts I and II are really just intros and outros to the album.  Contrary to popular belief, Animals is very easy to listen to, even though the songs are long they are magnificent.  All Pink Floyd fans should own this album, if you don't then you have missed a vital piece of their catalogue.
B00004XONN|4.0|First of all, this album is not nearly as bizarre as the people who hate it and the people who like it contend.  It's definitely not nearly as strange as any given album by Mogwai, Godspeed You Black Emperor, or Sigur Ros (who released a better album this year than Kid A).  All the reviews that say &quot;this album would be laughed at if it weren't by Radiohead&quot; are disingenuous at best, ignorant at worst. If this album was by any unknown band, there would be 15 or 20 glowing reviews here by a handful of connosieurs.   But, as it happens, Radiohead is a multiplatinum rock band, and so this album is garnering reviews both from critic types who think that rock stopped developing with the Replacements and save  their plaudits for various kinds of revivalism, and middle agers who vaguely remember &quot;Karma Police&quot; from the radio and bought this cd in tandem with the new Wallflowers album. The thing is,outside of the first couple of tracks, this isn't all that shocking. There are some incredible songs here, from Optimistic (which could have been on OK Computer), to the Warp records tribute Idioteque, to the fake free jazz on National Anthem. Unfortunately, in an attempt to make each song different than the last, the band has failed to develop any sustained mood. In the end, the album feels too brief, momentarily stunning for the duration of each song, but too unfocused to be satisfying as a whole, much like the b side compilation that many of its critics have accused it of being. In a year where decent rock albums have been scarce, however, it feels a bit like a luxury to criticize a very good one for overshooting its mark. Despite my criticisms, this is still one of the best albums of the year.
B000031WD9|5.0|Let me say that I thought the movie was pretty good, but the real reason EVERYBODY should check out this DVD is the feature-length commentary with director Paul Weitz, producer Chris Weitz, writer Adam Herz, and cast members Eddie Kaye Thomas, Jason Biggs, and Seann William Scott. <br />I got this DVD a long time ago, and just recently watched the movie with the commentary.  I think I laughed just as hard with the commentary as I did the first time I saw it.  It really is worth checking out.
0399146253|4.0|The Last Precinct is a follow up to Black Notice.  It is a very good book but it is not as good as some of the others in the Kay series.  This book will answer any lingering questions you may have had when reading Black Notice.  It is almost as if it should of been in just one book not two.  However, I did enjoy it a lot.  Patrcia Cornwell is a wonderful writer.  If you are a big fan you will like.  It also seems that the next book if there is one will turn in another direction.  If you think about it most things in life really do go around in circles and then you choose another path once you are satisfied.  I think this is what Cornwell is trying to do with the Scarpetta series.
B000002546|5.0|Genius!  Pure genius.  There are really no other words to describe this album.  Truly a great album, by far the best, most influential instrumental rock/fusion album of all time.  You hear Jeff Beck licks in everyone who has learned to play guitar since this album came out!  When, as Jimmy Page said, Beck is on, he is the best there is.  On this album he is definitely on!  And to me there is no finer instrumental song than Cause We've Ended as Lovers.  The bending, the legato slides, everything about it is perfect!  <br />More than any other player Jeff Beck epitomizes the Guitar God.  You must listen to this album, over and over and over...As perfect a recording as there ever was.
B00004XOWM|4.0|I was surprised by this album. I'm not a huge Limp Bizkit fan, but this album is good. Wes obviously has grown as a bassist. The whole album is heavier than the other 2 albums. I recommend this album to people who like a rap/metal mix.
B00004THAY|5.0|Wow!  What can you really say about these two guys?  They are simply the best in the busines.  While Claptons recordings of late (From the Cradle being a notable exception) have been slick, pop numbers, this album brings him back to the forefront of the blues.  This is where both men belong.  It is almost as if they have been recording together forever! There are some incredible moments on this album.  The title track is great, but Key to the Highway is fabulous, and I Want to Marry You is exceptional as well.  Buy this.  King hasn't sounded this good in a while, and Eric is back!
B00004WGC4|5.0|This is now rightly regarded as a comic masterpiece and after watching just one of these episodes you will understand why. Considering the fact that some of the episodes were made over 25 years ago, this still stands very well with its fast, furious, razor sharp witty dialogue and nothing but excellent comic playing. Its an absolute gem! John Cleese and his then wife Connie Booth wrote all 12 episodes in the two series' that were madein 1975 and 1979. The quality never falters through any of these episodes. John Cleese and Andrew Sachs provide most of the laughs with Cleese playing the permantley stressed and raving mad, Basil Fawlty, the incompentent owner of the appropiatley named Fawlty Towers and Sachs as the Spanish cook who has many hilarious moments with his delightfully fractured English, prompting Basil to continually justify to his baffled guests &quot;Oh don't worry, he's from Barcelona&quot;. Classic stuff! Prunella Scales as Sybil Fawlty and Connie Booth as the poor put upon maid have their fair share of laughs too. Its impossible to select a favourite episode so i'll let you judge for yourselves. A CLASSIC! HILARIOUS! An important contribution to British comedy. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
B000005PRX|5.0|BATMAN RETURNS is my favourite Batman movie in the series, but I know lots of people think this is the worst one. I don't care, I just love this movie. The Gotham City in Batman Returns is the most beautiful of the series, I would like to live in. And Keaton's performance is the better than last one. In face, he is the best actor who can act Batman perfectly. Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer are also done the terrific job, but Christopher Walken's Max Shreck is the most wonderful villian of the movie. well done! Danny Elfman's music is just the best. Tim Burton, we thank you. Thanks for give us just a beautiful and darkful Batman movie!
B00004Z4WR|5.0|this movie is great.  this is one of the finest movies of the year.  it has explosive action, and a moving story.  obviously the people who did not like this movie have never done any sort of crime, but for those of us that are criminals or ex criminals will simply love this movie.  amazing
0783232039|5.0|It's been two long years since I could finally bury the hatchet, and bring myself to watch this!  Now, with great shame (and pride) I lower my usual standards (on a once in a lifetime basis), and provide this thoroughly sick and violent flick with the coveted &quot;5-star&quot; designation.  Times have changed since Rod Serling's &quot;Talky Tina&quot; (a reasonable facsimile of myself) set the standard for an evil doll syndrome that reached epidemic proportions, and in fact still lives!  A very clever script and consistently dry wit won me over!  I expected things to become dull and unravel, but it never happened!  Jennifer Tilly is perfectly cast as Chucky's horror (in this case, similar to whore), devilish . . . (rhymes with &quot;pitch&quot; as in pitchfork). This film offers a delicious display of John Ritter's charming versatility (the proof is in the pudding).  Ritter was formerly  relegated to &quot;Master of the French Buffoonery&quot; for his work as gay boy &quot;Jack&quot; in &quot;Three's Company&quot;.  This relationship (Chuck and Tiff) was every bit as trashy as (The Twilight Zone's) Erich Streator (alias Telly Savalas) putting the clamps on me after I developed a paternal fetish.  The technical crew could have been more discreet regarding the graphic violence.  Excellent picture and widescreen quality makes it pretty obvious that when compared to me, &quot;Talking Tiffany&quot; is chopped liver.  For more details, click &quot;More About Me&quot; (Tina).
B000002GD8|4.0|This album is fun and innovative.  The lead vocals are destinctive, different and compliment each other.  Its a keyboard, guitar, and woodwind based album.  The best cuts are Sister Moonshine, Poor Boy, Lady, Just A Normal Day and The Meaning.  Yes The Meaning is a fun high energy rocker guys! I can't believe all the negative comments about it.   Actually all the cuts are good.  I'd say this Supertramp album is second only to Crime Of The Century (which is a masterpiece).
0782008372|3.0|I just bought this DVD yesterday, and watched it last night.  I  noticed no pixellation, no digital artifacts, and it was  displayed in 16:9 widescreen.  Perhaps they've partially remastered this wonderful movie...I didn't have as much of a problem as many people seem to have.<br />My negatives are as follows:  <br />Cheesy menu, but that's not my priority in choosing a DVD anyway.  Blade Runner has the same problem, and is still a wonderful  movie.<br />Slightly grainy when shown on my 19&quot; monitor...not a problem on a regular TV.  Looked like the grain was from the film, not an artifact.<br />Surround sound track pretty iffy...also not a problem on a simple traditional TV.  Not sure why this was so pronounced on one  system and not the other.<br />The &quot;still shots&quot; were done as they used to be on LASERDisc, which means as individual sequential frames.  My DVD player is  not set up to step both forwards and backwards...only forwards,  so this was slightly annoying.<br />Anyway, overall this is a decent DVD.  It's not my best quality disk...that honor would be saved for &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  But for such a cheap disk, with such a great movie, it's a good buy.<br />It lost 2 points...one for the surround sound audio track, and  one for the lack of more sophisticated menus.
1559211407|4.0|Helene Hanff was a New York writer and Frank Doel was a London bookseller.  This book chronicles the letters they wrote over a period of many years to one another.  Although they never met, they became true friends bonded by their love of literature.<br />Having read this tiny little gem, I can tell you that I'm not even sure why I liked it so much.  Maybe it was because I loved seeing a warm friendship develop between two total strangers.  Maybe it was because I loved the dry wit of Helene and the staunch Britishness of Frank.  Maybe it was because I liked hearing about the WWII years, how the people of Britain sacrificed, and how one caring American woman made a difference to this small group of Britishers.<br />One note:  this is the only book I have ever read that is truly enhanced by the video.  Read the book, then rent the movie.  Anne Bancroft is the perfect Helene and Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Frank.
0808574914|4.0|This is a really funny book that elementary students are certain to enjoy!  THE WITCHES involves much storytelling between a  grandmother and her grandson, who remains nameless, and her vivid descriptions of the characteristics of witches.  Children will most certainly love the idea that the kind lady next door, or even their classroom teacher, could possibly be a witch!  Witches don't like children, so you better watch out! You don't want to know what they might do if they catch  you.....
0684853523|5.0|This is a book that every writer (or aspiring writer) should read.  In his straightforward and no-nonsense way, King strips away the bull and drives home the point that there is no magic key to unlock the door, no secret known only to the initiated that will make a writer successful.  His stories of his own struggle are at times hilarious, at times poignant.  I alternately laughed and cried my way through this book because, as a struggling writer, I saw myself on every page.  Bravo to Steve King for his honesty and courage in writing this wonderful book!
B00004TRD8|5.0|This DVD certainly sets the standard for which all other future releases should strive for. This is perhaps the first movie release to actually utilize the full potential of the DVD format. Right from the intro to the menu, it becomes apparent to the viewer just how much effort went into the making of this DVD. it's got more options and settings than you can shake a stick at. If you're a sound buff like myself, you can't afford to pass on this one. i even pulled out one of my retired Pro Logic receiver to help decode the extra surround channel in DTS 5.1 ES. That extra surround channel surprisingly adds more depth to the already impressive sound effects. unfortunately, those effects are sparse. Now all we need is for George Lucas to come around and release The Phantom Menace on DVD. Afterall, the extra surround channel in 5.1 ES was poineered in that movie. Final thoughts: Get the movie and enjoy. It's got something extra for everyone, whether you are a sound buff or a behind the scene fanatic.
B000002HH9|4.0|Reading some of the unfavorable reviews of this album, many cure fans feel that this is their weakest offering and rubbish in general. I would wager that most who feel this way first really got into the cure with disintegration(as did I),and they would classify them as a goth band(I would not), along the lines of a group such as bauhaus. This label has been refuted by both robert smith and simon gallup who seemingly dislike the intrinsic limitations which accompanies this categorization that has dogged them since the release of faith. If you look up interviews transcribed from foreign publications when this album was released, you'll learn that they never considered themselves as being a goth band in anyway. Simon comments that they never wore black lipstick, nailpolish, or lamented graveyards. They also said that this perception of them has made for interesting encounters with fans who have seen them downing pints in a pub, and laughing like madmen without a care in the whole world. They even started out with a large skinhead following due to robert's shaved head, although they did not musically represent the skin head ideals, but sometimes people get caught up in the appearance more than the substance. If I believed that the cure were a goth band, and heard trks like the sardonic club america, the insanely happy mintcar, and the jazzy gone, imploring me to; get up, get out, and have some fun, I'd be thoroughly apalled as well. Anyone who has listened to pre-disintegration cure realizes that this  deviation from harder, serious trks. has been consistent. Listen to older trks like lovecats, the catepillar, why can't I be you?, and the mariachi-esque the blood, and tell me if they scream goth to you?! Since pornography, the cure have had a tendecy to produce quirky trks, and eclectic cultural musical infusions. The primary difference is the pervasiveness of these elements found on WMS, making it aptly titled. Undoubtedly, many also dislike it's lack of any thematic structure where trks seem to be cohesive expressions that fit in a whole mood, which is very atypical of the cure. If you do read interviews of the band relating to this album, robert states that they intentionally approached each trk so that it would be self-contained. The thinking behind this is that each trk could theoretically be a single. The cure also defied their label by releasing the 13th as the first single, with it's latin vibe(4 yrs before everyone else jumped the train), and blaring horns, instead of a safer, less representative trk like want. They didn't pull any punches, they wanted everyone to know that this album was a myriad of sounds. I listened to this album without the perception of the cure as a goth band, and gave it a another serious go once I realized that it intentionally lacked thematic structure by design, not incompetence. In doing so, the only trk that I dislike lyrically and musically is return, but the 13 remaining trks are solid to great. For those of you (and there are many) who consider the cure a goth band, no trk by trk descriptions layered in colorful metaphors by me or anyone else can convince you that is a worthwhile album. I only ask you to consider the cure's tendency, or perhaps agenda, to alienate fans. People who loved the up-tempo trks recorded before and on three imaginary boys probably were a bit confused by the sparse, atmospheric tones of 17 seconds. People who felt that pornography was an abrasive, pounding masterpiece were filled with a new despair when they heard smith gushing;&quot;Your'e so wonderfully,wonderfully, wonderfully pretty&quot; on lovecats. People who loved the balance of kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, may have felt cheated when they couldn't find a trk similar to just like heaven on disintegration. It wasn't a case of bad judgement which rendered some tremendous trks as b-sides to WMS singles(adonais, waiting, a pink dream, ocean, and it used to be me). These trks are all more palatable to people who prefer the &quot;goth&quot; aspects of the cure, and all would have been more pragmatic singles, if they wanted to pandar to people who envision them draped in black from head to toe, sitting in the corners of candlelit rooms, and stylishly sipping blood red wine from 15th century goblets. This extremist view has contributed immearsurably to the cure being one of the most under-rated bands in history, despite massive sells, and a devoted fanbase spanning the globe. This is most unfortunate for a band that has musically explored punk sensibilities with trks like plastic passion, stripped down, atmospheric moods on 17 seconds, synth-pop, middle eastern tones, jazz flares, horns, flamenco, harps, oboes, dank cellar basslines, and spiraling guitar riffs, and much more. I begrudge no one having their favorite side of the cure, their favorite type of mood, as long as they never forget that it's just one aspect of a band which has consistently shown us many...and I love them all.
B00004YKUX|5.0|Faced with his own mortality, Johnny Cash is still rediscovering his artistry.  &quot;American III: Solitary Man&quot; is his third solid release in the last six years.  Working in collaboration with Rick Rubin, Cash has produced another thoughful and moving album.  Johnny contributes for songs, while covering the likes of Tom Petty, David Alan Coe, U2, Nick Cave, Bert Williams, Will Oldham (!) and Neil Diamond (don't laugh, its a great song).<br />  Cash and Rubin once again take chances, and the result is wonderful.  If Cash's vocals are a little rougher than last time out (1996's &quot;Unchained&quot;) it just adds to the emotional wallop of the music.  This man has made such great music for so many years. I've been listening to Johnny Cash for almost all my life and, even during the long period in which he was phoning it in in the recording studio, Cash was more interesting than almost any other musician.  The fact that Johnny Cash is still making great music is a marvel, and I hope everyone that reads this gets to hear this terrific album.
B000002KD9|5.0|Heh, heh, what can I say, there are so many great reviews here on point concerning this, Neil Young's greatest contribution to music. Tell you why?  Well, it's so pure, so honest, folksy and sensitive--in a positive sense. To me it's intensely personal--epitomizing Neil Young's character.  <br />There's not a lot of electric guitar here--it feels like being in a large room with a high ceiling listening to acoustic piano and guitar played by someone who really knows how--great ambience. The electric is funky, minimilistic, to use another reviewer's term, and perfect; see for example, &quot;Southern Man&quot; and &quot;When You Dance...&quot; <br />Young wasn't afraid to use a straight country song, Don Gibson's &quot;Oh, Lonesome Me&quot;--although he turns it into the blues.  All the other music and lyrics are his.  Some gems:  &quot;Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself, when you're old enough to repaint but young enough to sell?&quot;  Or, &quot;When you dance, do your senses tingle and take a chance...while the lonely mingle with circumstance.&quot;  And &quot;yes, only love can break your heart...&quot;  <br />This record, too, may touch your heart.
B000002GJH|4.0|This album, alongside every Pearl Jam album, is one of the best albums I have ever listened to.  Hunger Strike, by far the most notable and best song on the album, delivers power and feeling like few other grunge songs ever have.  Ed Vedder, as always, delivers his usual soothingly deep vocals.  If I had any complaint about the album it would be over Chris Cornell's screaming.  I know that's simply how he sings, but it does get annoying.  Otherwise, this is a great album
B00004WEJZ|1.0|Did anyone out there who bought this DVD or reviewed it take the time to watch it? There is an entire scene missing from it!<br />After James Bond crashes the formal gala affair and leaves the doorman in the coatroom, the film jumps directly to the video duel between Largo and Bond. The scene in between is missing. That scene is where Bond surprises Domino. She had previously seen him at the health spa where he gave her a rub down, she thinking he was a member of the staff. The scene that is missing is where Bond introduces himself to her and she stumbles over her lines ordering a \\"Bloody Mary with plenty of Worchester sauce.\\"<br />For that significant omission I can not recommend this DVD. Also, other than the trailer there are no extras on this DVD. The aesthetic qualities of this film speak for themselves.
B00004XOWM|1.0|How do bands like this make any money? It just makes no sense to me how, when there are so many great bands out there, the ones like this, with their sloppy, garbled musicianship, shallow lyrics and awful rap-rock infusions get all the fame and recognition. I hope someone like Kurt Cobain comes along soon to start up another alternative revolution and wipe this kind of garbage off the musical map, putting REAL Rock N' Roll back on top where it belongs.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is a great album to add to your c.d. collection. The best song on this album is &quot;Diluted&quot; (in my opinion). If you like Coal Chamber, Korn, Sevendust, and/or Godsmack, then you will definitely like Slipknot. Get this album and go see them in concert. They put on a great show.

B000003TAB|4.0|Incesticide is NOT Nirvana's finest album.  In fact, it's not &quot;really&quot; an album in the way that Nevermind and In Utero were.  It is, instead, a compilation of various unreleased studio tracks.  Despite this fact, though, Incesticide is my favorite Nirvana album, simply because it is the most listenable.  While I don't want to describe the album as &quot;shallow&quot;, it is far less deep than Nirvana's other releases.  This album is sort of a &quot;Bleach Lite&quot;.  Some of the songs on this album are down right fun.  Tracks like &quot;Sliver&quot;, &quot;Molly's Lips&quot;, and &quot;Turn Around&quot; are a far departure from &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot; or &quot;Something in the Way&quot;.  This is not a &quot;pop&quot;-ie album, though.  To insure this, harder edged tracks like &quot;Dive&quot;, &quot;Anyeurism&quot;, and &quot;Downer&quot; were included (leading to the lop-sided feel of the album).  Basically, then, this album captures the range of Nirvana and is, on the whole, a great sampler of their amazing career.  If you've never listened to Nirvana before, start out here.  Or... at least until they finally release that Boxed Set (hint, hint).
B00004XOWM|5.0|Limp Bizkit has done it again.  This is by far the best Limp Bizkit album with the smash hit Rollin' and the incredible mix of hardcore and headbanging rock.  There is not one weak song on this CD and is one of those rare gems in which you can listen to the CD all the way through and still crave some more Bizkit.Keep the party goin with this awesome CD.  Keep up the good work Fred.
B00004XOWM|4.0|I bought the album yesterday it is a good cd with some great songs but there are a few bad ones. both rollin tracks are good and so is hot dog. Hold on is one of the not so great song it is real slow and NEVER gets going. But all in all its good and if your a fan go get it
B00004XQP4|2.0|I bought this album the first day it came out, and the first thing i thought was..&quot;A lot of fans are gonna hate this&quot; Not as many as I expected hated it, but atleast i am not the only one who thinks it sucks.  A few people complained about Nimrod cuz it was softer, but I liked it, cuz the songs were GOOD.  Warning is a letdown.  What happened to the driving guitar distortion Billie loved to use on songs like &quot;Longview&quot; and &quot;Geek Stink Breath&quot; and other classics?  Beats me, he must of lost his distortion pedal.  The only songs worth listening to are Blood... and Minority.  I suggest that any new fans should buy the albums in this order: Dookie, Nimrod, Insomniac, Kerplunk!, and 1039... then Warning.  Hopefully someday they will get back to their punk/rock roots.
B000006U44|5.0|When did YOU fall in love with Kate Bush?<br />For me, it was in 1978 when she appeared on Saturday Night Live, at the suggestion of Eric Idle. She was #1 in England at the time and a complete unknown here in the States. I searched record stores for years--YEARS for anything from this vision, this beauty, this amazing singer. When her albums were finally available here, in the early 80s, I was not disappointed by &quot;The Kick Inside,&quot; from which the two songs she performed on SNL, &quot;The Man with the Child In His Eyes&quot; and &quot;Them Heavy People&quot; appeared.<br />And then there was &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; the song that made her a star and basically put you on one side or the other of the Kate camp. Her observations about everything from saxophones to sex were different and exciting. <br />&quot;Room for the Life&quot; is the weakest song on here, but what you'd expect from a 19-year-old songwriter with a feminist bent. Aside from that, this album is so good you have to do a double take when it's over. Get it and play it and enjoy it and love it. And Kate, hurry up and make another CD soon!
B00004YKUX|4.0|The recent re-releases (Love, God, Murder, and the Folsom and San Quentin prison sets) seemed to suggest that Cash was now destined for relic status. Far from it. This album is a relevation. Cash's inspired versions of Will Oldham's &quot;I See a Darkness&quot; and Nick Cave's &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; show that he is more than willing to push the &quot;alternative&quot; envelope. More than that, he's stamped his dignified moral authority all over them, as is the case, to a lesser extent, with David Coe's &quot;Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)&quot; and U2's &quot;One&quot;. Of the Cash originals, &quot;I'm Leaving Now&quot;, a duet with Merle Haggard, is probably the best. Another highlight is Sheryl Crow's appearance on &quot;Field of Diamonds&quot;. Like &quot;Unchained&quot;, the album features Tom Petty and various Heartbreakers providing sparse, acoustic support, with production by Rick Rubin.  I've had a promotional copy for a few days now, and it hasn't left the player yet. And probably won't for some time.
B000009RC2|5.0|This was the first &quot;mainstream&quot; jazz/rock fusion album.  It launched a whole new style of music that is still viable today (althought not as popular).  Some of John MchLaughlin's earlier albums (Extrapolation and My Goals Beyond) were leading up to this sound. Other artists, such as Weather Report, were just starting to experiment with the style. But when Inner Mounting Flame came out in 1971, there was nothing else like it.  It legitimized the sound and led the way for such artists as Chick Corea and Return to Forever and all the spin offs.  It should be noted that all of these pioneers were disciples of Miles Davis.  As this music evolved from Davis's discordant jazz style, it eventually evolved into new-age jazz (for better or worse).<br />Not only was this one of the first, it is one of the best.  The Mahavishnu Orchestra could be considered a minor supergroup.  McLaughlin played with Davis and a number of other jazz musicians.  Jerry Goodman (violin) came from a progressive rock group called The Flock.  Billy Cobham (drums) was a session player and was part of the Becker Brothers group, Dreams.  Jan Hammer (keyboards) was classically trained in Europe and was a recent Czech refugee. Rich Laird (bass) was a photographer.<br />The music is a real fusion of hard driving rock and jazz.  The tracks are a mixture of fast, energetic tracks, featuring guitar, and slow melodic tracks featuring keyboards.  Hammer and McLaughlin dominate the album.  Of the four Mahavishnu Orchestra albums, featuring this line up, it is probably the best, with the strongest compositions.  However, I like Birds Of Fire better because there is more variaty in the music and has tracks that feature the other musicians.  <br />This line up recorded 3 studio albums.  The third studio album (Lost Trident Sessions) did not get released until this year.  Instead, a live version of three of the tracks of the third studio album were released as Between Nothingness and Eternity.
0767802470|5.0|Das Boot is one of the few movies that does everything right.  It is a riveting, true story of a Nazi U-boat tour during the 2nd half of World War 2.  The Allied Navy at that time was numerically and technically superior, and U-boats had to play some incredible cat &amp; mouse games just to survive.  In it's last half, Das Boot turns into a disaster movie as the U-boat sinks to impossible depths, and the crew races to fix the ship before their air runs out.<br />Although 3 and 1/2 hours long, Das Boot is never boring, and simply takes its time and gives life to every character onboard.  The acting is suberb - these are young sailors, naive about war, who question the Nazi regime and fight hard just to stay alive.  They truly witness the horrors of war, and Das Boot has many great scenes that you will never forget.<br />The picture has been cleaned up for this DVD, and is bright and clear throughout.  The movie is presented in 2 parts, one on either side of the disc.  That's right, you have to flip this DVD over to finish the film, but because of the length amd power of Das Boot, this is a good thing - you will need the emotional break!<br />Das Boot will always be best DVD to show off your surround sound system.  As a great submarine movie, the film relies on sound to portray much of the action and tension.  From all directions, metal creaks and snaps, bolts burst, and water drips.  The sound effects for the entire film were completely redone to take advantage of Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS.<br />This movie was originally shot in German, but the overdubbing is the best ever done.  Many of the actors performed their own dialog in english, and thus carry the same weight and resonance as their german performances.  Still, the german is powerful and fitting for a Nazi U-boat film, and generally easy to understand without needing to turn the subtitles on.<br />The best extra on this DVD is the full length commentary by director Wolfgang Petersen and leading man J&uuml;rgenProchnow, both whom feel this film was the greatest work of their lives.  Not only do they discuss the unique special effects used for this film (the entire u-boat interior set was placed on hydrallics to simulate explosions) but they also discuss the difficulties of making a realistic WW2 movie 20 years ago.  Germans at that time had tremendous guilt about themselves and the war, and felt that any Nazi soldiers had to be protrayed as inhuman, evil killers, when in fact they were often normal men caught up in a huge conflict.  Wolfgang also describes the first american viewing, during which he sat terrified of the reaction he might receive from such a sympathetic opinion of the Nazis.  As the film ended and the lights raised, the audience gave him a huge, standing ovation.  He deserved it - Das Boot is a wonderful, wonderful movie.
B000001F95|2.0|There are three very good tracks on this CD featuring Knopfler on guitar.  The rest is basic Irish music featuring a traditional Irish type of flute.  It is an aquired taste.  I found it to be high pitched and annoying.  The music works well as the soundtrack of the movie which is love story set in the background of the IRA.  But, the story is bleak and depressing, and so is the music.  Out of the context of the movie, the music isn't that pleasant to listen to, and would be a real downer for a Sunday brunch or a dinner party.  Someone calls it challenging.  It is a challenge to sit through it.<br />If you like the Titanic soundtrack, you would probably appreciate this.  As a bonus, you don't have to listen to Celine Dion sing.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is my favorite movie. The action scenes are great and it has a good plot. Natalie Portman before she became big.
0790751089|5.0|Lo que quiero que más prestes atención a esta película es el hecho de que Francesca tiene algo BUENO, pero que no la hace sentir conforme; no la llena. Con Robert podría tener eso, pero por deberse a la familia que conforma, no puede irse con él a pesar de las oportunidades claras de hacerlo.  ¿Diana, dónde está el anillo? ¿Dónde están tus hijos? ¿Dónde debería estar el corazón?<br />Hay oportunidades en la vida que difícilmente se dan más de una vez... a Francesca la misma oportunidad se le presentó dos veces (la escena de los autos es la segunda). <br />Si dices que no, talvez no haya tiempo de una tercera oportunidad. Si dices que no, que sea porque no lo dudas.<br />No hay más que esté en libertad de decirte, así que bueno, pase lo que pase, ojalá al menos hayas disfrutado la película.<br />Un beso y un abrazo.<br />Artefice di Pioggia.
B00003CWL6|1.0|I thought this was a &quot;B&quot; rated trash movie.  What a disappointment.  Kevin Spacy is such a great actor - this was a total waste of his talent.  I cannot believe it won the oscars it did!
0792846338|5.0|It's hard to imagine anyone else portraying Annie Wilkes on the silver screen than Kathy Bates. Her slow revelation of insanity to her captive favorite author is so captivating and so disturbing that you'll be thinking of her everytime you require medical attention.  James Caan plays Paul Sheldon very well and the small supporting cast (especially the recently deceased Richard Farnsworth as the sheriff) make this an enjoyable adaptation of the brilliant novel.  Although some of the more graphic elements of the novel were slightly altered (the hobbling scene for instance) for either rating or budget constraints.<br />The exploration of human psychosis is the key element here, and no one since Anthony Perkins in Psycho has brought a more convincing and somewhat sympathetic mad character to life.  Kathy Bates definitely deserved her Oscar for the role.  Rob Reiner's direction is spectacular and all in all this is one of the best suspense films ever made.  And also one of the best film versions of a Stephen King work.  An essential film for all!
B000002J1O|5.0|What Amazon.com states in its &quot;official&quot; review is true indeed: The Lamb lies down on Brodway has overshadowed Selling England by the pound but only in terms of popularity, not of overall quality. This is an epic, complex journey, sometimes Genesis get a bit too pretentious (but this is a well-know peculiarity that affects most prog bands) but we can forgive them for that because the lyrics and the instrumentation are simply amazing.  Buy it!
B00003CX8J|5.0|I'll admit, I was skeptical when I first heard that X-men was being made into a movie.  Natuarally, I looked back at what happened to Batman and shrugged.  But when I found out Bryan Singer was directing, I became hopeful and I am not dissapointed.<br />X-men is a stylish artistic ride through the world of X-men.  Plus it has something some writers can learn from: a story.  The characters in the story are the most important, and each character has a personality of his or her own.  Although I would of liked to see a little more of Storm's character.  Plus the movie was cast almost perfectly.  Patrick Stewart and nobody else could have played Professor X, it was perfect.  Plus the production design, costumes, and special effects are true to X-men, and make it even better.<br />Although some HARDCORE fans may try to find things wrong with this, it is just a very well made film.  I also can't wait for the DVD, it will be great.<br />Highly Reccomended.
0671034065|1.0|The second to the worst book I've _ever_ attempted to read. (The worst?  &quot;Left Behind&quot; by Tim Lahaye.) Don't bother buying it or even checking it out of your local library. Its a total waste of time! Its not even a good trash read for a beach or a long weekend.  Skip it and save yourself for something enjoyable!
B00004XONN|5.0|Ok, first of all.  Radiohead had 3 &quot;classic&quot; albums before this.  The guy that wrote the first review had no idea what he was talking about.  Anyway, I'll make it clear.  If you're one of the MTV-type that just likes trendy music, and you only liked OK Computer because it was the cool thing to do....then you'll hate this cd.  This album seperates the true fans from the &quot;fans&quot;.  They use more synths and give it an ambient mood to it, that's probably why people hate it so much.  You just have to love Radiohead to like this album I suppose.  If you haven't been in to Radiohead before, and you like ambient music like Aphex Twin, then you will like this album.  It also has a few acoustic songs on there that will please fans of their older style.  It has a little bit of everything for everyone.  If you think about it, it's just the next step up.  OK computer had some techno-influence, you had to see this coming. Buy it and listen to it a few times, it'll get better and better each time you hear it.  Help cleanse the Billboards of all this horrid rap and Kid Rock type [stuff].
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is by far the best Bizkit CD! It is so meaningful! It is intense and you can rock to it at the same time! You would be a fool not to pick this one up!
0694515302|1.0|I have given the lowest possible rating to the cassette version of this book. It is abridged - poorly!  Very boring and sounds like an infomercial for his services rather than the inspiring, sound information of the book. VERY DISAPPOINTED in the TAPED VERSION!
B00003OST8|5.0|This is one of my very favorite movies. It works on every level. The story is a classic one, and Hollywood, for once, re-created the story on film with a minimum of re-writing. The scenes are colorful. The music is well done. There's lots of action, some clever dialogue, and there's no doubt who are the good guys and who the bad guys are. Finally, Robin Hood is the quintessential role for one of Hollywood's classic actors. Errol flynn simply fits the part perfectly. It's as though he was made for the role. The other members of the cast take their parts very well, also. This is a fun and entertaining movie, suitable for viewers of all ages. No video library should be without a copy.
B000003TAR|3.0|I was a little disappointed with this album. Nirvana had an excellent album with, &quot;Nevermind&quot; and I think they peaked with it. This album has: &quot;Rape Me, All Apologies, and Heart-Shaped Box&quot;. I really enjoy these songs, but not too crazy about the rest of the album. Give it a listen and you decide!!!
B000005ZGZ|5.0|I love Fugazi.  Red Medicine - the album where Fugazi started branching out and slowing down - initially was the most off-putting thing I'd ever heard, but now I love it.  End Hits, its followup is now one of my favorite records.<br />I admire the band's early classics like &quot;Repeater,&quot; &quot;Waiting Room,&quot; &quot;Merchandise,&quot; &quot;Nice New Outfit&quot; or &quot;Margin Walker,&quot; but this record tops those excellent punk numbers by moving on from deliberate abrasion.<br />&quot;In On the Kill Taker&quot; had the band tinkering out with complex rhythms and structures, but often they couldn't break free of feedback-and-screaming while doing so.  This CD throws all that out the window - &quot;Floating Boy&quot; is pure dub, &quot;Five Corporations&quot; is the only punk song in 7:4 time I've ever heard, &quot;Break&quot; and &quot;Recap Modotti&quot; are downright funky.<br />Of course, the lyrics are always superb (especially the anti-borders Jeremiad &quot;Place Position&quot;) and Fugazi's performances have finally caught up completely with their songwriting.  Buy this awesome album!
B000001EAQ|1.0|YUCK! This is total sellout time for U2. What went wrong? The world will never know. I guess that what happens eventually. It becomes a business and the passion to write great music fades away. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM! Pick up someting earlier like, &quot;War&quot;, &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, or &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;, but not this album!
B00000IAU3|5.0|Words wouldn't do justice to this CD. I've had it for several months now and I never tire of it. Frequently a CD is bought just for one song (Perhaps Roswell's &quot;Here With Me&quot; or Eminem's sampled &quot;Thankyou&quot; in this case?), but here is a CD where you can enjoy it start to finish. I don't really like reading reviews in which Dido is compared to Sarah McLachlan or other singers, because they're all young, female, and talented--so what? Dido has her own style, and it is absolutely incredible. Buy this CD, because I can assure you, you won't be sorry!
B00004XOWM|5.0|thats right...the limp...b-i-z-k-i-t is back...and they havent missed one beat getting here. On the bizkit's latest album...they have the same blend of rap rock that we have all come to love...fred...wes...and the rest of the guys really deliver on this one...and i was happy to see a little bit more Dj Lethal...and the &quot;helping hands&quot; on this album really rock.<br />theres a few more tracks like re-arranged on this album (personally one of my favorites off significant other) which might anger the more heavy metal fans...but hey...theres plenty of break stuff too... so shut up...and pack up...and go buy this album.<br />toodles and mahalo
0679879269|3.0|Pullman's last installment of His Dark Materials is somewhat disappointing.  The book is well-written and thought provoking, but unfortunately it goes too far against the grain.      To begin with, the book has been heavily marketed as a young adult novel, but with this final installment teachers will be thinking twice about recommending any of the three books. It certainly goes against many of the foundations of Judeo-Christian beliefs, and it will be difficult to convince even the most liberal parents to accept it.      I also find it hard to believe that anyone trained in theology, especially a Roman Catholic nun would not know what &quot;play the serpent' means. Someone of Mary Malone's intelligence could certainly figure this out.  How insulting to the reader's intelligence.      Though the book was enjoyable to read as an adult, I feel as if Pullman duped the education community and dealt a heavy blow to reading teachers everywhere.  They are stuck with two outstanding novels that will interest and excite their students, but are unable to recommend or use the third.  What a shame.
B000001FN3|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project created an album around the works of Edgar Allan Poe. One of my favorite bands combined with one of my favorite authors. How could I do less than love this album absolutely?<br />The album starts out with the disembodied voice of Orson Welles, speaking the words of Poe at the beginning of the instrumental track &quot;A Dream Within a Dream.&quot; &quot;The Raven&quot; begins with a mesmerizing bass beat and Alan Parsons' EMI vocoder vocals. Listen to this song through headphones, and you will completely lose yourself in the musical world APP has created. Leonard Whiting sings lead, with old favorite Eric Woolfson on backup, and a chorale accompaniment that will give you the chills.<br />&quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, in my opinion, is the low point of the album. That may in part be due to Arthur Brown's vocals, which I just don't like as much as some of APP's other singers. However, this still perfectly captures the suspense and paranoia of the Poe story. &quot;The Cask of Amontillado,&quot; hauntingly sung by John Miles, Terry Sylvester and Woolfson, is easily my favorite track on the album. The overlapping vocals of Fortunato and his tormentor evoke the terror of the clammy crypts, made even worse by the soothing refrains (&quot;You'll feel your life slipping away&quot;).<br />&quot;(The System of) Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether&quot; is a fun, rowdy tribute to one of Poe's lesser-known comic tales, sung by John Miles and Jack Harris. &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; is a five-part instrumental epic that starts out with more narration from Orson Welles. The final track, &quot;To One in Paradise&quot;, is a sensitive and lovely song, reminiscent of some of Alice Cooper's quieter moods. Terry Sylvester sings lead, backed up by Woolfson and Parsons.<br />The liner notes are exquisitely detailed, giving a chronology of Poe's life and works, along with an interesting essay by Parsons about the re-release and remastering of the album. This is a rich and meaningful album, as well as a loving tribute to the master of horror. Listen to it on a dark and stormy night!album. This is a rich and meaningful album, as well as a loving tribute to the master of horror. Listen to it on a dark and stormy night!
B00004RJ74|3.0|The commentary from the director and writer was very verbose. They rarely talked about the scenes. This was a commentary that was easier to listen to if you weren't actually watching the movie. Scenes would trigger memories of events happening as they were making the movie and they would go off on tangents for long periods. Although the stories they relate are interesting, I'd prefer they actually talked about scenes in the movie.  Another drawback to the commentaries was you couldn't change them by using the `Change Audio' button, but had to change it at the main menu.  Since you couldn't hear the dialogue during the commentary, it would have been nice to be able to easily switch back and forth. The full-length documentary film `Full Tilt Boogie' was interesting and showed what it was like shooting the film.  This comes on a completely separate DVD. The name of the documentary comes from a line one of the crew uses to describe the shooting of the film. The gallery stills run very fast and aren't that interesting. The music videos include the song used for Salma's dance. This is just lifted from the film and some other shots from the film are intercut, but nothing new. The Zztop song is included and features Clooney and Salma in a completely different location. It looks like someone's expense house. The plot for the video isn't very interesting. The outtakes are mainly actors not getting their lines right and aren't funny.  The cut scenes aren't very interesting either. The longest one being a much more graphic and gross bar fight scene which even I couldn't stomach. The director also gives commentary on how he shot the opening scene and the bar fight scenes. This was along the lines of his commentary for `Desperado', only not as good. Finally the a 30-minute featurette is also included and gives some more interviews with the cast and crew, some scenes are lifted from `Full Tilt Boogie.' Overall, I'd say if you have this film on the previously released DVD, I wouldn't bother replacing it. There is nothing interesting enough that is added.
B00004Z1MN|4.0|Great movie; I wish it had been promoted more.  Does anyone know where to find the soundtrack...I can't find it anywhere.
B00004XOWM|5.0|WOW. LIMP BIZKIT ARE BACK AND EVEN BETTER. THIS IS DA BEST CD I'VE EVER HEARD. THIS IS ONLY SUITABLE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE LIMP BIZKIT
1570425671|3.0|Sedaris is indeed at his best with non-fiction.  &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot; is terrific, and &quot;Dinah the Christmas Whore&quot; is very good. The fiction pieces, however, are all weak, repetitive, and overlong; &quot;Seasons' Greetings&quot; in particular is painful to listen to, and mean-spirited in a way that none of the other pieces are.
B00004YKUX|5.0|When Tom Petty released &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot; in 1989, his song about self-sufficiency came off as little more than a laid-back look at life. But to hear Johnny Cash sing the words &quot;Well I know what's right/I've got just one life&quot; on &quot;American III's&quot; kick-off track, it almost feels like the song was tailored to the life that the legendary Man in Black has led. After all, Cash has explored every facet of sin and salvation for almost 50 years, and at this point, bolder words couldn't describe it better. On his third outing with producer Rick Rubin (who was at the helm for 1994's breathtaking &quot;American Recordings&quot; and 1996's Petty and the Heartbreakers-backed &quot;Unchained''), Cash's distinguished voice and delivery again take other songwriters' works into deeper places; even on such familiar songs as U2's &quot;One&quot; and Neil Diamond's &quot;Solitary Man&quot; he adds a poetic feel that was perhaps clouded in their original forms. Putting a Nick Cave song (&quot;The Mercy Seat&quot;) in the lineup also was a smart idea, as the suspenseful dead-man-walking fable captures a vulnerable Cash caught between life and death, perhaps mirroring what Cash has been going through during the last three years with Parkinson's disease and Shy-Drager syndrome. Much of the album feels like Cash and his buddies, including Randy Scruggs, Marty Stuart and Merle Haggard, just sitting around a campfire playing guitar (and sometimes fiddle and accordion) while Cash's love of singing a simple song takes center stage. Also of note are the sweet romp of &quot;Field of Diamonds&quot; (which features a playful three-part harmony courtesy of Sheryl Crow and his wife, June Carter Cash) and the jolly, self-deprecating &quot;Country Trash.&quot; The ominous closer, &quot;Wayfaring Stranger,&quot; however, hammers home the point that this legend indeed has just one life -- something that, in his old age and state of health, could be taken from us at any time. Still, &quot;American III'' is a fitting endpiece to the trilogy Rubin has masterfully crafted; while Cash was truly a solitary man on &quot;American Recordings&quot; (simply his voice and his guitar filled the record), &quot;American III&quot; shows he can get by with a little help from his friends.e.

B00004XOWM|5.0|Limp Bizkit has out done themselves.  I lost some confidence in Fred and the boys after Significant Other, but Chocolate Starfish is awesome.  There is the mellow tunes and rap beats of S.O. mixed with the powerful vocals and riffs of 3.D.B.  You hafta check this album out, definately a classic.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Limp Bizkit's recent musical offerings have proven them the most influential of todays artists. Chocolate Starfish is no exception, and if the music business was a stretch of roadway, this band is a Ferrari - faster, harder, and more agile than the rest. The initial offerings for radio &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Rollin&quot; are both high octane, super catchy tunes that leave other radio tunes in the dust. And the other songs on this record go a long way to proving that this band will be around for years to come. Fred Durst seems to know the importance of &quot;staying power&quot; and this cd establishes them as a musical force to be reckoned with long into the future.
B000003BF1|5.0|From the first track to the last, &quot;Let it Bleed&quot; is spellbinding rock and roll. This is time-capsule, put-it-in-a-rocket-and-send-it-to-an-alien-civilization stuff. It also reminds me of one of my favorite movies -- &quot;Goodfellas.&quot;
B00004XOWM|3.0|Fred Durst said in recent interview that their new album musically was going to be more like &quot;Three Dollar Bill Y'all&quot; rather than &quot;Significant Other.&quot;  &quot;Three Dollar Bill Y'all&quot; was an intense, raw in your face record that was a mirror image of the band themselves.  &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; may not capture the raw intensity of the first album, but it still packs quite a wallop.  Musically, these guys are getting tighter as a band.  Wes Borland is one of the most inventive guitarists out there today and John Otto (the backbone of the band) is way too underrated a drummer and deserves his props.  <br />I think the biggest problem with the album is Fred Durst himself.  While he incorporates more melodies on the record (and is actually quite good), his lyrical content leaves something to be desired.  While some of his rhymes may have been fresh in the early nineties, they seem kind of dated today, almost silly at times.  For example, in 'My Way,' the last line of the chorus is: My way or the highway.  Did he take that out of The Cliche' Dictionary?  Personally, that was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Just kidding Fred!<br />Anyway, as a Limp Bizkit fan, I was a bit disappointed, but it is a solid record with 'The One' and 'It'll be OK' as some of the highlights.  Don't get me wrong fans, this album still rocks and I can't wait to catch them live.  It's just that I was expecting more but if you are a fan, buy this record.  Then rock it on your system, pull up to a carload of girls, and pull down your pants and do the hot dog dance!
B00004XOWM|3.0|The new Limp Bizkit cd brought a few dissapoinments to me but there some excellent tracks on the cd. Hotdog is a profanity laced moshfest with distorted guitars and a fairly heavy sound next it is followed by another stand out track, My Generation. Well I thought if there was a reason to buy this cd then this is it, great work by DJ Lethal in this track. The only thing I didnt really like was the copius amounts of bad rap in this cd, I think on Rollin (Urban Assualt Vehicle) thats DMX I dont know but damn that sounds good. But other cameos arent the best, and Fred always has to mention Limp Bizkit in each track it gets irritating. Its a shame their are no tracks like Re-arranged though.... Still its gonna get tired really soon and new bands like Static-X, Pitchshifter and other in this new sound will soon dominate the airwaves. Expect Fred and Co to hang around a little bit longer..
B0000047CX|5.0|I'm one of that &quot;younger generation&quot; people here keep refering to and I love this record.  It is one of the beautiful I've ever heard.  I already loved the Sinatra/Jobin CD and was looking for more in that bossa nova style.  This CD provided that and more. This will be on my CD player during many late nights to come.
B00004XOWM|4.0|this cd overrall was pretty tight especially for ya limp bizkit fans. but myself not a major fan but i did like this cd alot... good lyrics especially in &quot;hot dog&quot; the lyrics were kind of amussing to me because of the overuse of the F word. well to any rap and rock fans... give this cd a try... you might like it... well atleast i thougth this cd was great. Strange outro... 10 mins! oh well enough of reading this just go ahead and buy, preview, or whatever!
B00000DRA9|4.0|This is an excellent CD for those lovers of 80's classic fantasy ( Legend, NeverEnding Story, Labrynth,  ... )<br />It is definatley worth the money
B0000507UD|5.0|The album is completly full of quality tracks. A big step from Signifigant Other and 3 dollor bill. It is faster and harder, but it is still just as good. The bounus disc gives you the excellent faith and a re-mix of counterfit. I also gives you the amazing videos from N 2 gether now, nookie, faith and re-arranged! in short - IT RULES!
B00004YYDI|5.0|One of the most astounding pieces of film I have seen.  Not only did Luc Besson capture the grittiness and violent aspects of this film, but he made the characters seem alive and likable.  With this international uncut version, you see a side of the two main characters(Leon &amp; Mathilda) that you did not in the original.  It is absolutely the best film about this profession, and I recommend this title to anyone who enjoyed the first version and to people that love a great story and lots and lots of blood.
B00004XMVH|4.0|A writer/director can take only so much artistic license before a story that is supposedly truth-based turns into a sham.  Jonathan Mostow runs dangerously close to that line.  The list of inaccuracies and improbabilities in this film is lengthy.  As has been noted numerous times, the British and not the Americans cracked the enigma code.  There were no blacks serving with whites on submarines, due to the segregation policy of the U.S. military before 1946.  The Germans were not evil, cold-blooded killers who strafed unarmed survivors.  The likelihood of a single torpedo hitting a ship showing only a bow profile is astronomically low, etc., etc., etc..  <br />If you put aside the fact that this was pure fantasy rather than fact-based fiction, this film was great entertainment.  The story was engrossing, the action was non-stop and the suspense was extremely well done.  Mostow uses every submarine film device ever invented and gives the crew a continual flow of crises to solve.  Yes, it smacked of U.S. nationalism to a fault and the music was so insipidly patriotic it became corny.  However, though this was a shamelessly derivative work, it was intense and twisty with great special effects, and that made it worth watching.<br />Many people have compared this film with \\"Das Boot\\", concluding that this film pales by comparison to that classic.  \\"Das Boot\\" is one of my all time favorite films, but I really don't think you can compare the two.  They were really telling completely different types of stories.  \\"Das Boot\\" was a highly realistic character study and \\"U-571\\" was a fantasy action/adventure flick.  The only thing that they had in common was the fact that they each took place inside a German submarine.  <br />The acting was nothing special, but in defense of the cast, the film wasn't really about the characters so they didn't have much to do except look tense.  The best performance was delivered by Harvey Keitel as Chief Klough, the old sea dog who held the crewtogether.  Matthew McConaughey was hollow and wooden.  This was not one of his better performances.<br />Despite a long list of grievances, this film still delivers high power entertainment and rises above its many flaws.  I rated it a 7/10.  Be prepared to suspend a ton of disbelief and then enjoy the ride.
B00004XONN|5.0|I feel like I shouldn't be reviewing this yet after only having it for a week and a half, but here goes.<br />Luckily, I went into &quot;Kid A&quot; open-minded. I heard it was quite the departure from my beloved &quot;OK Computer,&quot; arguably the best album of the decade. While &quot;OK Computer&quot; is like a pair of wide-open eyes staring at the madness in the world, &quot;Kid A&quot; is about the madness inside your own head. The lyrics are almost completely enigmatic. They don't work if you think about them too much, but they do work on an almost unconcious level. The franctic and panicky lyrics of &quot;Idioteque&quot; are the best example. (&quot;Women and children first / I laugh until my head comes off... Here alone, everything all of the time / Ice age coming / Ice age coming&quot;) I like the comments that this sounds like rock music from the future, but I think the best way to describe it is as the Finnegan's Wake of music.<br />Not only are the lyrics spectacular, but the music shows a real craftsmanship. The musical box that opens &quot;Kid A&quot; is the infancy of the machines. It is the perfect backdrop to the somewhat paranoid version of Peter Piper. &quot;The National Anthem&quot; ends with a brass section pounding out something that barely seems to have any arrangement in mind. Is it jazz in the 22nd century? Who knows. &quot;In Limbo&quot; has instruments that fade in and out as if from another radio station, and ends with a buildup where all the music turns to static, and the static fades out until all you hear is the churning of a machine. It cannot adequately be put in words. &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; is another fine song. An accordion accompanies the first verse, where the refrain is &quot;I think you're crazy, maybe...&quot; The second verse is backed by a few harps playing cliched dream music, which is perfect because what else have we ever heard harps play? That's what we might hear in our dreams.
6304341849|5.0|Picture yourself, a young Englishman in the early teens of the twentieth century. You are handsome, sensuous, rich and will be the up and coming power broker in the years ahead. You are also &quot;homosexual&quot;, that dreadful &quot;condition&quot; which if revealed could destroy your little kingdom. What do you do?<br />     Maurice explores the above question as we gaze upon two young men who are trying to come to terms with their homosexuality. Clive ( Hugh Grant) is the uptight aristocrat who knows he is gay but attempts to keep it under wraps. One must be practical, you know. Maurice (James Wilby) his lover is unashamed of the relationship and is celebratory of his love for Clive.<br />      The two men battle back and forth over what they can and can not do. Maurice goes through his own personal crisis of rejection, questioning and anger in accepting himself as well as trying to receive affirmation from Clive.<br />      This is an excellent video on the struggles that these two men have in homophobic England where discovery could mean the end of a career and disgrace. Underlying the emotional turmoil of the two men we find a class issue full of snobbery on both Maurice's part ( his initial encounter with Scudder, a servant), Clive's obsession to achieve and a contempt for women. Clive uses a woman for a cover while Maurice gets enraged over what as he sees as his sister's love for Clive. Enter into this remarkable love story filled with all of the tensions and heartaches of two men trying to come to terms with their sexuality.
0679879269|5.0|It's October. I'm waiting slowly, ever so slowly, for my Wheel of Time Book 9, and even slower, my Harry Potter Book 5.<br />Suddenly, I remember a series I had enjoyed before. It was unfinished, the last book wasn't out. So, I found to my joy, that it had come out, finally, and shortly thereafter I had the book in my hands.<br />Be forewarned, however! This book has something that Wheel of Time and Harry Potter still lack -- an Ending. And this ending is the kind I like. The loose ends are pretty tied up, yet you still have a burning desire to write bad fanfiction. So much is left open to the reader. I was personally crushed. &quot;No! This isn't the way it was supposed to happen! Where is my Happily Ever After!?&quot;<br />You see, this book has a moral. A really good moral. I'll leave you to discover that. But I can identify with the ending. It's so sad though. Some complain about the slowness of the thing. I found it to be slow pased, but good in that way. There was no clear climax, I thought...But perhaps the entire mess with the bomb has something to do with it.<br />In any case, I'm rambiling. Buy the book. Read it. Read it over again. Cry. Cry for the people of the world, cry for Will and Lyra. But most of all, find the moral, and hold to it. It's a wonderful way of life, to be true.<br />Enjoy.
B000002BYD|2.0|What has happened to the grunge rock behemoths that were Pearl Jam? While I was at school, their iconic guitar rifts epitomised the frustration of my youth and was perhaps the perfect music for almost any situation that I happened to be in. Unfortunately, I drifted. Having experimented with all kinds of weird and wonderful music genres, I returned about one month ago to my old albums. I proceeded to rediscover successively &quot;Nevermind&quot;, &quot;In Utero&quot;, &quot;Vs&quot;, &quot;Vitalogy&quot; and &quot;Ten&quot;. This is music at it's very best. Unfortunately, my inquisitive nature lead me to find out what Pearl Jam have been doing more recently. Oh dear, the classic rock anthems have been replaced with soft, unmemorable ballads, meaningless drivel and more 'thoughtful' songs. With the notable exception of &quot;Brain of J&quot; (which betrays their previous and infinitely preferabe origins) this album almost reduced me to tears, wondering what malediction has reduced one of the greatest bands of the 1990's to betraying what propelled them into the fame they have today. This is not evolution of their music, it is almost complete degeneration. They score two stars, one for previous merit, the other for not being Hansen.
B000002GVO|5.0|. . .the Eagles took me through high school and college.  I can't remember a time when they didn't have a single on the radio from 1972 through 1979.  This album was so, so different from the earlier ones.  It wasn't just Joe Walsh joining the group and adding his wild guitar playing and personna, either.  By 1976, the group was at the top of its game, and moving a little bit away from &quot;country&quot; rock (or &quot;Crock&quot; as some music critics called it back then).  You can still hear a little bit of the &quot;country&quot; flavor in &quot;New Kid in Town&quot; up until you reach the bridge part in it, and also the intro to the title track, as well as &quot;Try and Love Again.&quot;  The rest of it is rock until you drop:)  What to make of the title track, by the way?  Some people say it was symbolic of the group members' trying to walk away from the partying, drugs, casual sex, and Satanic worship they'd dabbled in, and how even though you can stop those things, you still have the bitter memories and regrets for the rest of your life.  Others say it doesn't mean anything. . .Glenn Frey and Don Henley &amp; Co. were just up to their usual great storytelling tricks.  It's still a fun song to listen to, as much for the great instrumentation as the story.  By the way, most people think it's Joe Walsh doing all that great guitar work that follows the last lyric, but it isn't.  It's really Don Felder, the blond-haired tall drink of water who said little and played much.  Joe's influence is heard on many of the other tracks here, such as &quot;Victim of Love&quot; and &quot;Life in the Fast Lane.&quot;  <br />Many of my younger friends discovered the Eagles' work during their reunion tour, when their new album featured a more &quot;unplugged&quot; version of &quot;Hotel California.&quot;  But as far as I'm concerned, the definitive version of their sound is here, in the original production.  This, and Volume 1 of their Greatest Hits, are must-haves for Eagles fans, old and new.
B000005IRG|5.0|I've never done this before, but I have so thoroughly changed my mind about this album that I felt compelled to post another review and right my hideous wrong.  I gave it 2 stars and lambasted Verlaine's voice.  However I've now listened to it about 10 straight times through giant headphones and Verlaine's voice has grown on me to the point where it is no longer grating, allowing the unbelievably fantastic guitar interplay to come to the forefront where it belongs.  <br />Absolutely a milestone record, and far better than Blondie (I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!)  The title track is one of the few songs in all of rock and roll, alongside such esteemed company as the Who's Won't Get Fooled Again and Dylan's Desolation Row, which justifies being very long with its incredible guitar interplay.  This is one of the most underappreciated records in history and deserves the same retrospective seminal cult status as VU + Nico and Big Star's Radio City.<br />I was terribly misguided to give Marquee Moon only 2 stars in my previous review.  If you, too, are turned off by Verlaine's voice, I can only beg you to get over it so you can get to the stunning climax of the record, the shrieking, majestic guitar leads at the end of Torn Curtain.
B00004XOWM|5.0|When I think of Limp Bizkit I don't expect flowing melodies or insightful lyrics, I want angry lyrics and loud beats; Limp Bizkit has succeeded in accomplishing that. I also appreciate how this album is about 70 minutes since a lot of CD's are only about 40 minutes these days. If you liked any of the previous two albums then I suggest buying this one.
630018403X|3.0|Ahh, this movie.  Oh, dear.<br />This film was released at a time when I was especially susceptible to it; I was 15 in 1985 and was smack in the middle of the target market.  I must have seen it at least half a dozen times since, and while my admiration for the craft of it has grown, my perception of what the film actually _does_ has sharpened and become more caustic.<br />In brief, Hughes starts with a superb premise and proceeds to systematically fudge it, rather than threaten the commercial appeal of the film.  Watching it now, it starts soooo promisingly, with John Bender (Judd Nelson, excellent) in full bulging-eyed effect as the potential Lord of Misrule in this teenage purgatory.  He is rude, obnoxious, and genuinely threatening as the quasi-berserk working-class loser.  Over the course of the story, the various denizens of detention learn to overcome the prejudices they have about each other, and leave the building as a supposedly coherent bunch of Human Beings.  <br />This is the bit that I find implausible.  There were John Benders in my school, and they were this frightening, almost this intelligent, but no way were they this vulnerable.  (In case you haven't guessed already, I am represented here by the Anthony Michael Hall character - the studious nerd - except that I wasn't that studious and no way did I do so well academically.)  It was necessary for Hughes to flatter his largely teenage market by promoting a dream of solidarity - teens against the oldsters! - that simply didn't exist in the mid-Eighties.  Hughes does manage to capture the utter distrust and dislike of authority amongst these kids; they defend Bender from the unpleasant teacher, even though they don't like him, and that much is accurate.  (Trivia note: Paul Gleason, the classic 80s rentavillain, he did exactly the same hardass mo-fo schtick in Trading Places, is great as the teacher, who happens to be called Richard Vernon - I'm guessing, after the veteran UK actor Richard Vernon, whoplayed the elderly square in the train compartment in the first reel of the first Beatles' movie &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;.  Teen revolt intertextuality.  Somebody follow this up, please.)    <br />This could have been a seriously radical (in every sense of the word) film if the other kids had turned on the Nelson character and torn him to shreds.  Instead, he gets the prom queen and even gets to stick her diamond earring in his lobe.  Of course, the film I dream of would never have been made.<br />Still, it was something of a pleasant shock, when you were 15, to find your most subversive sentiments being aired in a Hollywood movie, even if the film ignored, glossed over or otherwise fudged them in the wind-up.  So I still enjoy The Breakfast Club, even though I no longer believe it.  The thing I find depressing is that teenagers today seem to be even less rebellious...
0140157352|4.0|This book provides a marvelous structure for learning about negotiation. I have always felt, however, that standing on their own the methods of _Getting To Yes_ are a little unrealistic--they assume that the other party wishes to negotiate as well. This assumption is corrected in _Getting Past No_, which may profitably be read in conjunction with _Getting To Yes_ to enable the reader to develop a more useful skill set.
B00004YKUX|5.0|There's something irresistable about an old, wise rebel singing songs of despair and melancholy. Johnny Cash has carved out this niche for over 45 years. He's walked the line and gone down in a burning ring of fire. He's surpassed illness and critics. &quot;American III: Solitary Man&quot; follows &quot;American Recordings&quot; (1994) and &quot;Unchained&quot; (1996) as Cash's third cd produced by Rick Rubin (Beastie Boys et al.) Cash shines on remakes like Tom Petty's &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot;, Neil Diamond's &quot;Solitary Man&quot;, U2's &quot;One&quot;, Nick Cave's &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot;. When Cash is dark, he's very dark like the lyrics in &quot;I See A Darkness&quot;. He can turn on a dime and produce sad, painful comedy like &quot;Nobody&quot; and &quot;Country Trash&quot;. He never loses the heart and soul of country/folk playing and singing. At 68, Cash is the oldest, coolest artist in my collection, and I look forward to each of his recordings because it seems like he always has some new way of seeing life and relationships. Some artists have nothing to say or make a few cds and then have nothing to say, but Johnny Cash continues to show the wisdom of age and experience and its value in our lives. I don't like country music much, but I sure do dig Johnny Cash. &quot;American III: Solitary Man&quot; stands on its own.
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna is synonymous with words like metamorphosis &amp; chameleon.  What makes her the most engaging artist of the 20th century &amp; what this album forbodes as making her the most engaging artist of the 21st century is the sheer scope of her talent &amp; musical foresight.  If you thought Ray Of Light was radical Madonna, then this album will surprise you even more because its combination of folk/electronica/pop with the aid of Mssrs Orbot and current man du jour Mirwais reveal a truly amazing masterpiece.<br />The album's title track sets the pop mood for the album with some psychadelic acid-rock.  The album's following song, Impressive Instant is the killer though as it rummages through the archives of leaden rock and adds a twist of experimental electronica, and stirs with a lashing of pop.  It is quite a revelatory peace, guided by the refrain 'I'm in a trance'.  It constitutes the song's ambience, and takes you out of 'it', with no narcotic requirement.<br />The remainder of the album slows down the pace somewhat although the likes of Amazing &amp; Runaway Lover do clinch the dance market.<br />American Pie, Madonna's folk-dance tune of recent characterises the mood of the remainder of the album (and is included in the UK version of Music, as it was her 10th Number 1).  I Deserve it is quite tender, and the next single (according to recent press), Don't Tell Me, No is a catchy folk-pop song, which is screaming for a dance-makeover, &amp; with luck shall continue the mass success Madonna has enjoyed since Evita.<br />Along with Impressive Instant, Madonna's reworking of Mirwais' Paradise is a true gem, and the douleur of Madonna's voice as she embraces death and leaving her lover is simply chilling.  The mood of the electronic ballad sets the tone, and if you speak French, the words simply break your heart.  I have never equated Madonna's ballads with an ability to make you cry, but this one does so with panache.<br />Music is a cleverly eclectic, albeit inspired and complete musical piece, which lacks dull moments (What It Feels Like For A Girl is the weakest, but not awful).<br />Madonna, we salute your vision, talent and musical genius.  <br />If this album is an omen for Madonna's career in the 21st century, well she's going to be President of the Music Industry, &amp; has set a musical trend which can only be aspired to, but never convinvingly emulated.
0792156684|2.0|I liked parts of the movie especially the action scenes in the last half, but I didn't like the characters very much. If the two main characters were different and a different storyline to them was given, it might have been better. The charcter setup just seemed to easy for a movie supposed to be this big. I don't think that the scenes follwed history well either. Lets just say it should have been rated R. It wasn't up to all the hype either. Leonardo DiCaprio definitely wasn't the right actor for the role either. He was mainly just there to attract to under 20 girls. I would rather have a good movie with a good cast and have a lower gross than to know the movie wasn't that great with these characters but know it made $600 million. Definitely didn't deserve an Academy Award. Maybe for effects. Send this movie back to the ocean. the best thing about it was Celine Dion's song...which got on a lot of nerves after a while too. One star for the end of the movie. One star for the only interesting characters played by Billy Zane and Kathy Bates.  Oh well. Besides the fact that it is the #1 grosser, it is pretty forgettable to me. Skip this one.
044651652X|1.0|I can't believe that there are readers who spent so much time writing paragraphs and paragraphs telling how bad this book is.  I'm not saying they're wrong.  They're as right as I am writing this review, but are all those words worth this disgusting book.?  I only read it because my ladylove liked it so much.  I'll give you some reasons why this book is a load of horse manure.  The author describes Robert Kincaid as a quiet, shy kind of guy.  But boy, can that guy talk.  He's one hell of a screwed up protagonist.  The worst central character of any work of fiction ever written.  That Francesca must have been one desperate woman to even think of having an affair with this self-centered, swollen-headed piece of turd.  Compared to the book, the movie's a work of art.  It's amazing how the scriptwriter for the movie could have produced a passably good story out of the horse manure that the book is.  During an interview the author remained silent when he was asked who his choice of Robert Kincaid would be for the movie.  He obviously wanted to be Kincaid.  To be honest, he would have suited the role of the aging Francesca better.  I cannot believe the man had the audacity to churn out six more pile of dung.  The amazing this is, there are folks who read such crap.  What's the world coming to!
B00004XOWM|5.0|This CD really shows the limitlessness of where Limp Bizkit can go - if they set their mind to a certain style of song, they can accomplish it. They have hardcore rap (Rollin'{urban}, Getchya Groove On), hard metal (Full Nelson), anthems (My Generation), quiet and soulful (Hold On, My Way) and Eminem style quips (Hot Dog). They truely are a widely diverse band. They have moved away slightly from the last albulm, it is far more similar to their first LP, which I believe is a move for the better. This CD is really one of the better CD's of the year, and after a few listens it'll grow on you. In the words of singer Fred Durst himself - &quot;If you hated Limp Bizkit before, you're really gonna hate us now, but if you liked us before, even a little bit, you're really gonna love us now.
B00003CXCK|5.0|Why, oh why, isn't this movie available on DVD?  I do realize that it is filmed in grainy black and white and the visual advantage of DVD would be under-utilized, but such a powerful story needs bonus materials to satisfy and educate the viewers.<br />Most aspects of this movie have been well covered by other people writing some fine reviews here, but one aspect that everyone seems to overlook is the side story where Amon falls for a jewish girl and has conflicting thoughts.  He can't understand his desire for her, when he has long accepted the treatment of the jews as animals.  In a scene where Schindler is trying to buy her from him, Fiennes does a very good job of portraying his grief of dealing with his own changing views.  Also in this scene, he makes Schindler realize that he is aware of what Schindler is doing, but will turn a blind eye to it anyway.  So not only has Schindler been mellowed out by the racial environment, but it was obvious that it was starting to affect the monster that Fiennes portrays as well.  If things had been allowed to progress as they were, perhaps Amon would have curved his own anti-semitic views under the influence of Schindler.
B00004XOWM|4.0|This is right there witht the &quot;NOOKIE&quot; baby!
B00004XONN|1.0|This new release from radiohead pales in comparison to ok computer.  It simply lacks the melodies present in ok computer that are also absent in pablo honey and the bends.  Whining unintelligeble vocals are alright if they flow with the music, but in Kid A, the music is just as whining and unintelligeble. Not worth the plastic it's printed on.
B00001NFCY|5.0|This group is just awesome.  I never really liked rock or alternative, and still don't.  But I do like Creed a lot.  I don't know why, I guess they're just good.  They have good lyrics and good guitar play.  They should be the model for many other rock type groups.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Don't let the cover fool you, this album is very much a Limp Bizkit record! This album has more collaborations with other artists. I particularly like the one with DMX. Not as good as Significant Other because the lyrics aren't so good but still full of foul language and loud guitars! Check it!
B00004XOWM|4.0|The beat, bass, scratches and wild pumping vocals really sets this disc apart from the previous 2 albums. Fred Durst has roped in the right artists to guess appear on this record like icp(2 provoke the hell out of eniemn) n method man(to keep the hip hop roots flowing) the songs are all jumping and some melodic. definately worth the money. the lyrics are fab and the songs are quite easy to digest. it has a bit of the rap metal element in them as well as the sound from disturbed to keep this record pumping. The only thing that was dissapointing was that there was no collaborationg with primer 55 a band that can repell this album into greater greatness. good this wes went back to the 6! too much of 7 string sound destroying good ole guitar cuture. may this be a turning point to rap metal and trigger the sound of orgy/rammstein inspired music.
0399146253|2.0|Loyal fans of Cornwell will be sadly disappointed in this first person introspective that reeks of psycho-babble.  One is not sure what Cornwell is trying to prove, but it is certainly an abysmal failure.  Recommendation is to NOT read this book near an open flame as the temptation to toss it in would be too great. Let's hope Cornwell comes to her senses when writing the next book of this series --------
B00004XOWM|4.0|If you liked significant other or 3 Dollar Bill, you'll love this CD. If you've never heard of Limp before, you'll like it to.<br />Although the popular songs that everyone have heard of (Rollin and My Generation) are the reason most people might by this, there are a lot of other good songs here too. Even the intro and outro are reasonable.<br />This CD is a little softer than their previous two releases, but in my opinion it's much much better, including great songs like &quot;Take A Look Around&quot;, &quot;It'll Be OK&quot;, and &quot;Rollin (Urban Assualt Vehicle)&quot;, the lesser known version of Rollin.<br />My recommendation: definitely buy it!
B000005DQR|5.0|This album takes Mr. and Mrs. shadow outta the shadows and into the light !Heavamercy !
B0000507UD|4.0|Who thought that they would put out an album that rivals all of their previous releases?  I did.  I was not disappointed.  The hard hitting &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; is probably their best song ever, not to mention the split personality song &quot;Rollin'&quot;.  All around great album to just sit back and chill to.  Although you might be tempted to get out of your seat and jump around.
B000003JDA|1.0|Being a die hard Tull fan, and after just seeing their tour pass throught New York, I was excited to see all the 5 star reviews for the CD.  So, I went and picked this CD up immediately. How disappointing. The India influence was refreshing to hear, however, his lyrics have no direction and the music is scattered at best.   Tull, known for scattering his music and putting it together again beautifully, on this CD forgets to put it together. Has he ran out of important statements to say to us??
6303369170|5.0|Lili Taylor is a godess!! This film opens a window into a realm that very few can recreate. Depp is sexualy alluring as allways, and Dunaway radiates a beautifull energy. Open mindedness is recomended while watching, so, allow youreself to be engulfed by the pure honesty, and disturbing glory of this wonderfull, seductive film. ... ... But, thats just my oppinion.
0684853523|5.0|This is a great biography.  Stephen King's life is facinating and inspiring.  From his early recolations of pain through his persistence at writing and his recovery, it makes for great reading.  It also makes  a great introduction to the real meat of the book.<br />    It's as if your favorite English teacher wrote the best horror stories.  But wait, he does!  Not only that, he just encorages you to rumage through his desk.   Borrow the vocabulary and scramble up the words to make your own sentences.  Brush up on your grammar and discard those uneeded adverbs.  Pick up the pens and write with them.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Pretty good this one. I have bought and heard there first two and id give them both a three outta five. This has got to be fred dursts best effort with his singing although there maybe a few to many bring it ons. I like the way the band has hit back at Trent Reznor because he was the one who dissed limp first. Anyway im not gonna blind you with meaningless opinions.

B00003CX5A|5.0|Burton does an excellent job with this classic american horror tale... The visuals are stunning and do are excellent at conveying a terror by gaslight tale, and the DVD is great for delivering them in the clear and crisp manner they deserve. Depp does a great job as the stalwart believer in fact and evidence, and really makes a great Constable Crane.<BR>All in all this movie is a great on, and seeing on DVD is a must. Any Burton fans wil agree this is a MUST HAVE, and most people can enjoy this twist on a classic american 'myth'.
B00000JCOV|4.0|Indeed this is not for everyone but if you like Korn, Coal Chamber, or MACHINE HEAD this will rock your World. Slipknot is a very hard band with great singing by No. 8 (Corey) and Great drums and percussion by nearly half the band (there are nine people in all).  Also if you have a chance to see them in concert BY ALL MEANS GO!( But stay in the back because the Mosh Pit gets very Hectic and dangerous, unless you like that sort of thing.)
B00000J2KT|4.0|This is really two movies in one. The first half covers the slow descent into insanity of one Pvt. Leonard Lawrence &quot;Pyle&quot; (Vincent d'Onofrio) as he and other recruits endure the gruelling boot camp overseen by Sgt. Hardman (R. Lee Ermey). The last half of the film covers the Vietnam Tet Offensive. The underlying theme throughout the film is how war deprives us of our humanity. Stanley Kubrick paces the film well and gives the war in Vietnam a different look unseen in other related films. The all too familiar jungle scenes are replaced with the &quot;concrete jungles&quot; of war-torn Saigon. I read that it was shot entirely in England, for Kubrick hates to venture far from his London home. The only qualms I have with the DVD is with the picture format. Instead of widescreen, we're stuck with the sole option of pan and scan. Thus, the four star rating. Maybe Kubrick viewed it in standard format and decided he liked it better. Who knows. This is still a great movie and worth the viewing.
0679879269|5.0|This book is incrediblely well done.  So many books are called &quot;new classics,&quot; but it is really true in this case.  Every step of the way was magical and unpredictable.  I have only one small quibble with the author.  I was saddened by the statement that &quot;Christianity is a lie; a beautiful, strong lie, but a lie, nonetheless.&quot;  Unfortunately, not all parents are broadminded enough to allow the &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot; that a fantasy calls for, and thus many children will not be given access to this fine book.  However, it is true that CS Lewis certainly felt free to be strongly pro-Christian in his fantasies;clearly Mr. Pullman has the right to feel otherwise.
B00004XONN|5.0|Everyone i have talked to either loves this album or thinks it is horrible noise. Hardcore fans seem to be overprotective of the album and are quick to say &quot;it is even better than OK Computer&quot;. I don't see how you can compare the two albums. they are completely different and unique experiences. Ok Computer works as a whole, while Kid A is better if you focus on each song individually. I don't consider myself a hardcore fan. I loved The Bends and OK Computer and Pablo Honey is above average. Kid A is nowhere near as accsessable as those albums. Some of the songs may be a little offputting at first, but if you sit and listen to them individually there is a quiet beauty in them. Strange sounds may come and go and some may complain about the lack of guitars but the thing that has always been Radioheads best instrument remains :Thom's voice. With each album he seems to let the reigns loose a little more and this time out he achieves a new high. On &quot;The National Anthem&quot; his voice is filtered and comes out beautiflly. &quot;How to dissapear completely&quot; is probably the most beautiful song the band has ever done. The best on this album, for me anyway, is &quot;Idioteque&quot;. The feeling of desperarion in the song is palpable.  So is this Radiohead's best album. I don't know. But why catorgorize? Just enjoy the wonderful music made by talented people.
B00004XOWM|4.0|highly enjoyable combination of pretty weighty grooves, sweet melodies &amp; *juvenile* lyrics. 2 songs are rap, 2 songs are kinda *mellow*; the rest is pure action, same standard as &quot;take a look around&quot;, really good, very accessible (of course). (try helmet for something with similar heavy grooves -basically helmet invented that *genre*- and a lot more b r a i n s). j!
B00004TH6O|3.0|This release from the 'Queens Of The Stone Age' is a fast paced,hard rocking,'no-brainer' 42 minute romp.It's great music for getting you in the mood for a rip-roaring night on the town.This is self-evident from the first few seconds of the first track,'Feel Good Hit Of The Summer'-which is just a repeated list of various 'substances',backed up by a hard-rocking guitar riff.Track 2 is excellent and sounds so like Soundgarden.In fact the c.d. just sounds like so much music that's been done before,such as 'Black Crowes' and 'Faith No More'.There is nothing at all new here in this c.d.-which is why I felt I couldn't give it a higher rating.There are plenty of good songs on the c.d.,especially 'Auto Pilot'which is less 'in your face' than the other songs.The change is a welcome relief.The title of that song is very apt-just put yourself on 'auto-pilot' and you'll find this a quite enjoyable c.d.
B00004YKUX|5.0|Once again Johnny Cash walks the line of greatness with his new album.  The tracks are clean, crisp, and some beautiful.  The standout track has to be his cover of U2's &quot;One&quot;.  He adds a slight melancholy tone to this already somber tune, but in a way only he can.  The guitar playing in this song is outstanding, and makes you want to stop and soak in all that is being played.  I first heard this album in a local record store the day of its release, and I could not get enough of it.  I only have three words for those reading this review: buy this album.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Phat beats, Phat bass, Wes working his Guitar Magic, DJ Lethal tearing it up, and of course, that guy Fred on lead vocal, combine their talents to produce a good follow-up to &quot;Significant Other&quot;. Not quite as hard as &quot;3 Dollar Bill Y'all&quot;, but certainly capable of holding it's own musically, vocally and lyrically. The robotic intro sounds pretty dope, and from track 2 straight down to the end of the cd, you pretty much get sucked in to the hypnotic beats and rhythm. Listen to &quot;Hot Dog&quot; and count how many times Fred says the &quot;F&quot; word, and how he disses NIN...enough said. &quot;My Generation&quot; has that heavy sound to it with the beats and guitar meshing well with Fred's vocals. &quot;Full Nelson&quot; is tight...sort of basic, but it flows. You'll wanna crank up the volume in your car when you hear it...and may want to punch someone who has dissed you. &quot;My Way&quot; is smooth vocally, not too hard and not too soft...just a smooth flowing track...&quot;Rollin&quot; is phat...a song to cruise to... &quot;Livin it up&quot; is smooth too...it uses &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; sample from the Eagles, but it fits in perfect. You might say &quot;The Eagles???&quot;...but don't worry, the sample fits the song and is utilized well. The smoothest track is titled &quot;The One&quot;...just a laid back track with good bass and drums. The vocal is tight and Fred actually sings. It sounds cool...&quot;this could be the one....&quot;. &quot;Take a Look Around&quot; from MI2...enuff said, and a few other tracks that round out the cd. All in all, it is a CD with balance. Not too many hardcore tracks or mellow stuff, but somewhere in the middle. X-Zibit, Scott Weiland and others guest on some tracks so it has a flavor that all will enjoy. There is a little something for everyone. This album will go platinum in 2 seconds...everyone is waiting for it. Go and get your copy...trust me, if you like anything they have done before, you will enjoy this CD too...
B00004XONN|4.0|Just like OK computer (which I still play every day), this album is slowly making me obsessively play it. Completely different from OK Computer, yet still wonderfully imaginative and sonically stunning. I think it is 4 stars now. Talk to me in a week, and it may have reached 5.
B00000IAU3|5.0|After buying this CD, I made one very large mistake: I let my friends listen to it.  Now they're told their friends and everyone's trying to get me to loan the thing to them, saying they'll return it &quot;in a little while&quot;.  But I'm smart enough to know that when you loan a CD this good, you never get it back. One listen, and you're in a total state.  There isn't a bad song on here.  There isn't even a mediocre one.  This is some of the best music I've ever heard.  Each track is different, yet they're all &quot;her&quot; somehow.  The track most people will listen to first is the one she got known for, &quot;Here With Me,&quot; the theme from &quot;Roswell&quot;.  Though that is a beautiful song, there are many others that should be given a chance.  On &quot;Hunter,&quot; the rich guitar chords and ethereal background voices play off each other brilliantly.  &quot;My Love Has Gone&quot; is an echoey, Irish-folk-music-sounding ballad that will make your heart ache and bring tears to your eyes.  &quot;Best Day of My Life&quot; sounds like a catchy, laid-back cross between Jewel and Vitamin C.  The title track, &quot;I'm No Angel&quot;'s earthy folk-rock sound and meaningful lyrics make it one to prompt you to hit &quot;repeat&quot; multiple times.  On &quot;My Life,&quot; she experiments with bluesy piano riffs and a choir, and pulls it off beautifully.  But the best track on the CD is &quot;Isobel&quot;, a passionate song about a runaway.  It has in it some of the best chords, best vocals, best hooks, and best lyrics of any song in history.  I can't begin to describe the spell it puts on you.  It's utterly amazing.    After listening to the CD, I turned on the radio.  All the false love songs and &quot;moon-June-soon&quot; rhyming were a pale shadow of what I had just experienced.   Who is this girl and where has she been hiding?
0440416027|5.0|Skellig is an extrodinary piece of literature. It is equally good for both adults and children. Skellig is beutifully written. It is extremely lyrical, almost like a very long poem. The plot is thin, but still, the detial makes this book impossible not to finish.      Michael has just moved to a new house, with no friends, and on top of that, his family is in a really hard situation. Michaels new baby sister is sick, and they don't know whether she'll live. And Michaels new house is dilapidated and the &quot;garage,&quot; as the real estate agent calls it, is so broken down that it's unsafe to go inside. Michaels house seems empty. He is very lonely.Michael however, goes in. He finds something, a creature like an angel, but not quite.      Great book, maybe one of the best I've read. Definitely a must-have. Five stars!
B00004XOWM|4.0|Well let me say first of all this album was very much anticipated by me.  I made sure to be at Best Buy right at 10:00 when they opened so I could get a copy of the CD with the bonus CD included.  The bonus CD I thought would be a couple of songs that would be great, that people would envy that only a select few had on print.  What I got was a screw off session, which is cool to see the band having fun, but to me is totally useless because I won't be listening to it in the car.  The album itself is as good as their last.  The thing that I most enjoy about Limp Bizkit is Wes Borland's ass kicking guitar riffs and Fred Durst's voice.  I think those are the reasons I stick around and listen.  The only disappointments I have with this album is that the song &quot;The One&quot; sounds exactly like &quot;Re-arranged&quot;, but not even half as good.  I also wish that the lyrics would get a little more in depth than &quot;just don't give a f@$k&quot;.  I would love to hear some songs with rage against the machine deepness to them.  &quot;Hold On&quot;, &quot;Rollin air raid vehicle&quot;, and &quot;Livin it up&quot; are my favs on the album, and all though I like DMX, Meth, and Redman--I don't think the remix of &quot;Rollin&quot; should even be on the album--same with &quot;Getcha groove on&quot;.  All in all it is a solid buy, but I guess I was expecting a little more from this album.  Better luck next time.
B000009QPE|3.0|I have never liked Slayer that much. Even though this album is supposed to be a cornerstone in thrash metal I don`t see why. I mean it`s barely 30 minutes long and there is no classic songs. But I gave it three stars because there are a few good songs here such as Angel of Death and Reigning Blood. The problem is that the songs are almost always the same pace and they are too short. Nonetheless I still have two Slayer albums so I don`t dislike them that much. I think this Satanic thing is ridiculous but I must admit that when I`m pissed off I do enjoy listening to this cd; it calms me down.
B00004XOWM|2.0|What the hell? I go out to the store to buy the new Limp CD and I get this?  This isn't a horrible cd, butit is a huge dissapointment compared to what it could of been.  I've been a big limp fan since the days of Three Doller Bill Y'all, and I was a bit dissapointed with the release of Significant Other, but this CD takes the cake.  Tracks like &quot;My Way&quot;, and &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; are the two stars in this review.  Without them, this cd would be just another coaster for my coffee table.  Buy it only if your a hard core limp fan.  Otherwise, go pick up Three Doller Bill Y'all...
B000004286|5.0|I never really liked classical music. I bought this album because I loved the music in the movie and have always been fascinated with bagpipes. Unfortunately, there weren't a whole lot of bagpipes on this album (I had to go out and get MORE MUSIC FROM BRAVEHEART). <br />I love this album. It evokes the same emotions as the movie: love, pride, sadness. I put it on when I feel like relaxing or when I'm feeling romantic. A very good all around album...James Horner does beautiful work, although I still haven't picked up his soundtrack for TITANIC.  <br />Anyway, if you liked the movie, you just might like this album. Go back and watch the movie and pay attention to the music throughout. Unlike a lot of soundtracks these days, it follows the movie pretty closely.
B000002IV8|5.0|This was the first Overkill album I ever bought.  I heard From The Underground before but didn't get into it because of Bobby's voice.  After finding a used copy of I Hear Black at the Wherehouse for 5 bucks, I'd have to say this is the best record I've heard in a long time.  I've grown to get used to Bobby's vocals, and downright love the combination of him with the best metal I've heard in years.If you've heard of Overkill and like hard driving metal that is filled with talent, lots of time changes and emotion to spare, pick this up and prepare to get run over.  World of Hurt and Spiritual Void are my picks for this album.
B000001FTD|5.0|Among the living is a pretty good thrash album. It is even considered by many as one of the best thrash albums of the 80`s. Is it their best? I`m not sure, there`s two other albums that are pretty good as well. Those being Persistence of Time and Sound of White noise. It`s probably better that P.O.T. but I`m not sure about the other one. Nonetheless this is an excellent album which showcases the talent of Anthrax and which helped solidify their status in the big 4 (Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer). Highlights include, many of the songs actually but my favorites are I am the law, Skeleton in the closet, and Indians. An overall very good album, no worries here.
B000025802|5.0|When I first started seriously collecting classical music, I tended to avoid box sets.  As part of my classical music self-education, I wanted to buy recordings by various respected performers, conductors and orchestras in an attempt to understand how performances and styles differ.  Of course, even back then I made some exceptions -- the Borodin Complete Shostakovich String Quartets, Rudolf Kempe's Complete Recordings of Strauss' Orchestral Works, Toscanini's Beethoven Symphony Cycle, and this Dvorak Cycle by Rafael Kubelik.  My original reason for purchasing this title was threefold.  First, I adored Kubelik's recording of Dvorak's Slavonic Dances on DG, so he seemed the perfect choice for Dvorak's Symphonies.  Second, unlike Beethoven or Mahler, there were not numerous single-disc Dvorak symphony performances available, particularly for the early symphonies.  Third, the value was and continues to be amazing.  But if the music isn't good, then no matter how inexpensive the title is, it's no value at all.  Well, rest assured these performances are amazing.  For example, I still find this to be the single best performance of the 9th Symphony (From The New World), more magical than legendary accounts by Reiner, Szell, Fricsay and Paray.  However, it was the early symphonies that were the initial treat for me -- particularly the 2nd and the 4th.  If you are not prepared to purchase the cycle, you can always get the very same versions of the 7th, 8th, 9th and \\"The Wood Dove\\" on a DG two-fer, or the 8th and 9th on the DG Originals disc.  But if you love Dvorak, the whole cycle is the one to buy.
0790729644|5.0|Gone are the lightning-quick reflexes, the heroic gunfighters and the clean death duels. Unforgiven strips all the myth and glory out of the western genre and we're left with a story that rings a bit more true than most other films of this genre.<br />Clint Eastwood plays William Munny, a retired killer determined to take on one last job to help support his family. As director of the film, Eastwood goes to great pains to differentiate this tale from the many other westerns he's made. The vicious gunfighters in popular lore are revealed most often to be drunken sociopaths who are usually more lucky than good. Munny knows the myths for what they are. He doesn't waste time quick drawing and spraying bullets around the room when careful aim and direct shooting are more likely to win the day...especially with half a bottle of whiskey in the belly and a nice helping of luck, that is!<br />Fine acting by Eastwood and co-stars Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman, coupled with a terrific screenplay and fine directorial effort also be Eastwood make this movie well deserving of the numerous Academy Awards it won.<br />This movie doesn't set out to nullify all the wonderful westerns that precede it, but it certainly succeeds at taking a fresh look at one of the more popular genres in American film.
B00004XOWM|3.0|First of all I've got to say that I'm a huge Limp Bizkit fan, `Significant Other' is one of my favourite albums of the last few years and I even liked `Three dollar bill...' so I'm sad to say that I found this album a bit of a let down.  This is quite a shame because when the band are on form, like on first single `My Generation' and the hip-hop track `Rollin (urban assault vehicle)', they are absolutely awesome.  Sadly the problem is because `Hot dog....' is basically a pop album, no don't get me wrong, the band haven't gone all commercial (the riffs are still heavy, Fred's language is at it's most explicit) but it's just this album is designed with a certain market in mind (e.g. the `streetwise' white boy rap scene) and it seems contrived to fit all the criteria's for that market.  A lot of shops may stick this in the `alternative' section but I can assure you there's nothing alternative about this album.<br />Like most pop albums this has it's share of fillers, `Hot Dog' rips off the chorus from theNine Inch Nails track `Closer' (yeah, I know it's an attack on them, but it could be more subtle), `Full Nelson' is just a remake of `Stuck', and `Livin it up' is just four minutes of Fred talking about himself and has one of the worse samples ever (from an Eagles song).  There's also too many skit's and unfunny in-between song interludes, which is just a case of the band having more fun than the listener, and I must also mention that the lyrics are atrocious, if Fred really is a spokesperson for this generation, then this generation is completely screwed.     <br />Fillers aside, there is still some good stuff to be found on the album.  The mellower tracks like `My Way' and `The One' see the band in fine form (although neither beats `Re-arranged' from the last album), `Take a look around' is a classic and, surprisingly, the RnB flavoured `Getcha groove on' is also very cool.  So there's enough good tracks to make this album purchasable and, on the whole, this is a decent album with excellent production and some cool special guests. So why is it a letdown? Well it's contrived and manufactured  and it tries too hard to be trendy, which is a shame because if the band concentrated harder on the music they could have made another classic to sit alongside `Significant other'.  A disappointment but if you can accept it for what it is then you will probably like it.
B00004YKUX|4.0|You would think that after all of the medical problems Johnny Cash has had lately that this CD might be sad entry, but you would be wrong. From the opening cut of Tom Petty's &quot;I won't back down&quot;, to the interesting &quot;Country Trash&quot;, Cash is in fine form. He also has some heavy weight help including Sheryl Crow,Tom Petty,and old friend Merle Haggard. There are some moments when his normally strong voice wavers just a touch, but they are few and far apart. One of my favorite tracks is &quot;Nobody&quot;.All and all one to listen to again and again.
6302638771|5.0|I watched this movie in my Literature class today, and I had to turn away when they showed that terrible footage of him getting shot in the head.  This movie will keep your attention.  It talks all about &quot;the magic bullet&quot; and the many people that were involved in Kennedy's death.  A very gripping movie, I recommend it if you are fascinated with this story.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is a great cd.It is one of the best buys you can get.It has &quot;Rolling&quot; and &quot;My Generation&quot; and many more songs which are great.If your a rock fan,this is a definite buy.

B00004XONN|5.0|This work is a sonic melted mixdown sludge of a great deal of music that has gone before it - classical, disco, hip-hop, dada, blah-blah. Yes, there are patterns evocative of and similar to Mingus, Sun Ra, Eno, Glass, Kraftwerk, Aphex Twin, Underworld, Beck, Bowie, Vangelis, Blade Runner sound effects and many others, and to me it's beautiful. Those who argue that any of them &quot;did it better&quot; or that Radiohead should &quot;stick to rock&quot; are making highly personal aesthetic judgments, and good for them. I appreciate all of these artists in my own ways as well. Much in the same way that Music for Airports is a self-consistent work about a feeling and place and mood, so is Kid A. But rather than just being a placeholder for emotions, Kid A speaks to the isolation, confusion, and worry about what technology is bringing us all to in the 21st century. I'm not saying that great Art has to be relevant; I'm saying that it makes me meditate on my own feelings and that's OK by me. I believe that scribbles made by three-year-olds can be as beautiful as any Rothko or (enter favorite artist here), and it doesn't require a lot of dissection because it's how it makes you feel in the end. And I appreciate a mainstream band like Radiohead taking the leap into the highly diverse Beck-like amalgamated sludge rock arena. Maybe it'll get some people to explore other types of noise than they're used to. What excites me is that Kid A, like many of us, asks: what's next?
B000001EMW|4.0|Apocalyptica is a band with four Cellos that run around the world playing other people music, and they really do a good job... Off course that they ask the permission of the real musicians, soo the don't get suit. If you are that kind a guy that like all kind of musics specialy Rock and Classical music. You will definetily like this album, specialy for the Metallica fans that can apreciate their sound in a diferent way. But don't expect much if you are those guy that love Metallica because off the hard sound and the huge Morche pits in the concerts. This is an album for people who apreciates the good music that Metallica has to give us...
B00004XOWM|3.0|As happens with most bands that play the rock rap crowd there are some songs that you'll love and others you'll hate.  My favorite is My Way for the way it starts out and picks up.  Most of the rest are good to listen to but don't stand out for me, although the intro is cool for the weird sound.  Anyway, love it or hate you'll find something worth while so check it out.
B00004XONN|5.0|This album had quite a bit of hype surrounding it. When such a media frenzy is built up expectation's get made. Kid A met and went far beyond my expectation's.   Radiohead in my opinion is one of the greatest band's ever to exsist. I'm terribly dedicated so I suppose I can't aproach this review objectivly, but I'll try my best.  For those who are comparing this album to OK Computer, or even The Bend's, stop. The band will never do something that they've done before, with that fan's of certain album's will feel alienated from new material, as is the case for some with Kid A. You have to look at the album from a &quot;music&quot; fan's stand point and not a &quot;Radiohead&quot; fan stand point. Musically this album is amazing, and if you dont own it already it's a must have.  Thom Yorke is a genius as are the brother's Greenwood, Ed O'Brian, and Phil Selway. The album is simply brilliant and deserve's all the hype that surrounded it.
B000001EL7|4.0|Contrary to the amazon review, this was not the last album with the original Kiss line-up, but I'll move on.<br />This album represents, to me, the high water mark for Kiss in the seventies. The songs are all classics, and even the remake of &quot;She Kissed Me&quot; isn't too unbearable. Also, this is the first album that all four members sang lead vocals.<br />That said, don't be too hard on poor old Ace. No, he doesn't have a great voice. Neither does Gene, but that doesn't stop him. <br />Overall, this is a must have for diehard Kiss fans, and the newest recruits in the Kiss Army. For the uninitiated, this is a great example of seventies Rock and Roll at it's finest.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Well, I might as well just put it this way, I was looking forward to this record so much that I went out and bought it the night before it's release. Since then, I have listened to the record over at least 3 times a day and I have to simply say that I love it. Like Signficant Other, this record isn't so heavily rap mixed with rock but rather combines good melodies with heavy guitar riffs throughout and hints of rap here and there. And it turns out sounding surprisingly good. The opening track, &quot;Hot Dog,&quot; it a great opener with tons of energy and is very catchy. You all know how &quot;My Generation&quot; sounds, one of the 1st singles, and the 4th track &quot;Full Nelson,&quot; is another one of those, &quot;I'm gonna break some () now, full of energy&quot; cuts. &quot;My Way&quot; has a clever and catchy beat to it, as does &quot;Livin' It Up&quot; and &quot;Boiler.&quot; However, my two favorite tracks would have to be &quot;I'll Be Ok&quot; and &quot;The One,&quot; as these can show you the kind of deep lyrics that Durst can think of when he puts his head to it and the perfect melodies that the rest of the band can put behind his songs. All in all, I loved this album and would recommend definately to anyone who has any interest in this band.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a must have.  It's my flat out favorite movie.  No home should be without it!
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is one AWSOME cd people ROLLIN will have you slammin all night long. I cant stop listening its even better than there last album (Significant Other) If you like Limp Bizkit GET THIS ALBUM (oh and please vote this review as helpfull THANX)
B00004XOWM|5.0|This here is one good CD!  If you like Limp atall, you owe it to yourself to get this CD, really good!  It's also cool that they have two versions of Rollin' (Both are good).  My Generation is the same song, you all know and love, same with Take a Look Around.  Hotdog is kinda cool, Full Nelson has a good beat, My Way is straight up cool.  All of the tracks are awesome, allthough The one, extends from that song, to this other one, that's also really cool.  Yeah, whatever, just get it.
0380804557|5.0|I walked into a book store to get some coffee and maybe read a magazine.  I saw Stardust, picked it up, and didn't stop reading it till I reached the end, two and a half hours later.<br />Neil Gaiman is a master.  This fairy-tale sweeps you away into the world of the Wall.  Gaiman has the story planned out from the first page.  The characters and plots fit together perfectly, there is not a hair out of place in the words.  Everything that is said is important, but don't let this overwhelm you:  this is defeinetly the kind of book that you can read over and over and find something new and different each time.  It is certainly a treasure, and, leaving out the single curse and a few racy scenes, would be an amazing read-aloud book to a kid.  The book is great for them, as well as the lucky person who gets to read it to the child.  It is easy to understand and they can say &quot;Oh, wow, I get that!&quot; and help the other reader understand what is going on (sometimes kids pick up on the little things ;)<br />I highly reccomend this book.  It is worth the price and so much more.
B00004XOWM|4.0|If you thought Limp Bizkit's last CD was good well your in for a treat there new CD Chocolate Starfish And The Hotdog Flavored Water is ALL that and more. Buy this CD you wont be dissapointed it will keep you up all night busting to some phat beats and hard rock SUPREME SWEETNESS!!!!
B000003TAR|5.0|only analogies involving fire can possibly apply to this greatest album of the nineties. it will singe your eyebrows at fifty paces, it cant help but enflame the soul of the listener.hearing it makes you realize that nothing,or no one that insisted on makeing this type of inflamatory full sensory poetry could  exist for to long beacuse as in all other exeamples nature hates fire.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|im sorry, but for those of you who believe that atdi is rehashing someone else's act or being childish or whatever, there is something wrong with you, namely musical immaturity. i would agree that this might be the future of hardcore, but i find it hard to believe that anyone could follow their footsteps. trying to follow what they've done so far is a humbling experience in itself. and im not talking about whatever kind of fame they have gained in recent years, im talking musically. and if you dont understand, listen again, and really listen--to the words, the music, the everything.  get some good headphones and hear everything that is going on there, and those doubting the production's worth should surely reconsider. and i could go on forever about these guys live. like in most cases, the people who hate these guys just dont understand yet, and maybe never will.
B00004XOWM|4.0|I kinda knew what to expect from this one and I wasn't disappointed! There was a big gap between the first two albums but this continues in &quot;significant&quot;'s vibe, meaning the heavy stuff plus a lot of cool moody slower stuff, something I liked a lot on the previous one! Some people find it's the same formula again and yes it is but it's good! It's like Korn, they always sound the same but it's always good!! The only thing I like less on this album is Fred's lack of originality in his texts, I always loved the way he raps and it's still good but he uses a lot of expressions word for word from &quot;significant&quot; and he doesn't say a lot!! Still the vibe is there, the grooves are there and it (musically) delivers the good , I think!! My favorites right now are Boiler, Rollin', The one, Livin' it up and It'll be O.K.!! I can't imagine what this album(especially Hot-dog ) sounds like on the edited version, ouch!!
0679879269|5.0|pullman's writing is so vivid, he makes you feel everything along with the characters. this is a beautiful finish to the trilogy and if you liked the first two, (who didn't) then you should definatly read this. however, it took me three years to get over the ending of the second book of the sally lockhart trilogy and i don't think i will ever get over the end of this book. pullman seems to have something against leaving the reader satisfied. although a completly happy ending would not seem apropriate i think there should have been a little less bitter and a little more sweet. read this book with a box of kleenex.
B00004XONN|5.0|Simply that: astonishing. This is like nothing I have ever heard before. I really think they've reinvented music here, they're going someplace I don't think anyone's even been.<br />At some point in the future, this will be regarded as one of the most influential recordings ever. Buy it.
B000002H6C|5.0|Stands solitary atop the heap, proud and unsurpassable, as the greatest document in the annals of modern metal.  Sure, the production is weird (poor Jason Newsted, like Rodney Dangerfield he never got any respect, at least not from these clowns) but it works.  You must own this awe-inspiring creation.
B00000016K|5.0|If you aren't familiar with Cream, this is where I would start. Its a truly superb album, marred by a few sub-par songs, but on the whole this record can go toe to toe with just about any rock 'n roll record ever made. Its that good! The album is a fabulous blend of blues and psychedelia, and if you don't know what that means buy this album and give yourself a treat. The only other record ever made that excedes Wheels of Fire in those categories is Jimi Hendrix's &quot;Electric LadyLand&quot; (but that album is one of the five best rock records ever made.)<br />Some of the outstanding songs include &quot;White Room&quot; a blistering, psychedlic blues that was the albums greatest hit. It combines Eric Clapton delicious whah-whah guitars with Ginger Baker thundering, polyrythmic drums, and Jack Bruce's great vocals. A masterpiece all by itself. But the album doesn't stop there. &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot;, an old  blues number, is taken to the roof tops with Clapton's swirling, screaming, crying guitars. Then there's &quot;Deserted Cities of the Heart&quot; - a very fast number who's energy is only topped by its sense of desperation. <br />But the real killer songs on this album are the live recordings - Robert Johnson's &quot;Crossroads&quot;, and another old blues number &quot;Spoonful&quot;. &quot;Crossroads&quot; shows Cream at its manic best - they set out on a blistering pace and don't look back. The two guitar solos on this cut alone are worth buying the album - just a full scale rail against the heavens! Just when you think it can't get any better than that, along comes &quot;Spoonful&quot;, a slow, blistering blues  with gut wrenching singing and guitar playing. Both are just stunning!! <br />If you're a Cream fan, all you need to know is whether or not the GOLD CD is worth it. There are two versions of this CD available - the &quot;remastered&quot; version and the &quot;Gold CD.&quot; I have both, plus several copies of the original vinyl.<br />The Gold version costs twice as much as the &quot;re-mastered&quot; version, but its worth it if you care about sound quality. The sound balance on the Gold version is both warmer and clearer. There's a little bit of a raspy edge to the &quot;re-mastered&quot; version that is absent from the Gold CD. <br />In addition, the GolD CD brings out lots of nice details, and a greatly improved stereo image. You'll hear  Jack Bruce's bass more clearly. There are lots of little sonic treats that jump out - the glockenspiel sparkles on &quot;Pressed Rat and Wharhog&quot;, the double bass drums that Ginger Baker was famous for really jump out on &quot;White Room&quot;, and Clapton's guitars just sound so warm and clear throughout the whole album. If you're listening on an inexpensive hi-fi, Walkman, or something like that, its probably not worth buying the Gold CD. You won't be able to hear the difference. But on a good setup, this Gold CD really pays off - its a &quot;show off&quot; type of recording.
B00000JBCP|4.0|Este es el mejor disco que le he escuchado a Mana, quiza por los areglos que metieron en el y la frescura del sonido que lograron inyectarle. Las letras son obias, directas y, como en &quot;El mulle de San Blas&quot;, un poco forzadas. La elecion de covers fue excelente y los cambios de ritmo en sus canciones clasicas son muy vitalizadores. Un disco para oirse.
B00004YKUX|5.0|This is one of the most heartfelt albums I've listened to in a long time. While I felt that on Unchained not all the covers became &quot;his&quot;, that is certainly not the case here. These are all Johnny Cash songs, regardless of who may have originally written them.  The album finds Cash decidedly more reflective than on many past efforts. One imagines he is in a similar place in life as Bob Dylan was when he made Time Out Of Mind (although Cash lacks Dylan's natural pessimism).  Overall a sterling effort that leaves me desperately hoping there'll be many more to follow.
B00001QGPS|4.0|This is a great album bringing together two great artists, Method Man from Wu-Tang and Redman from Def Squad. This album was  my first real exposure to Redman, but I've been a Method Man fan for quite some time. And those who have always loved Method  Man's great lyrics and smooth flowing will not be disappointed with this album whatsoever. Redman was also a pleasant surprise to  me, very creative and very smooth, though not quite as intellectual at times as Method Man can get he provides a lively  companionship to Method Man.<br />  There are quite a few vivacious beats and some absolutely fantastic lyrics on this disc, but my one complaint has to be that the beats  could be stronger. Many of them are not all that great, and seem to lack originality which is why I wind up giving this disc only 4  stars. The other major reason is that though there are a lot of good tracks on this album there is a lot of stuff on here that is only  so-so and thus I find myself skipping tracks quite a bit. On the bright side though Erick Sermon and The RZA do a great job of  producing several of the tracks.<br />  My favorite track is probably &quot;Fire In Da Hole&quot; which just has a great all around sound to it. No real story or narrative here but it has  one of the best beats on the album and has some really nice lyrics as well. &quot;Da Rockwilder&quot; is of course a great track, but it's really  too short. &quot;How High&quot; is done in a great remix version on this disc and is some ways better than the original version. &quot;Cereal Killer&quot;  is a narrative story about sneaking into a house and capping some unsuspecting victims. Not always my cup of tea, but it's done here  with a wit and wordplay that has me laughing all the times.<br />  Oh I should also mention &quot;4 Seasons&quot; which is a great track featuring Ja Rule and LL Cool J as well. It really shows that LL is here to  stay, and that not-so-new comer Ja Rule has a lot to show us over the next years. I also want to mention the &quot;Blairwitch&quot; parody  this is one of the funniest skits I've heard on a rap album in years.<br />  If you like hip-hop this album is an absolute necessity. If you're not sure but you want to hear some extremely literary lyrical flows,  then this is a great album to listen to. If you like this album, I highly recommend that you check out Wu-Tang's Enter The Wu-Tang  probably one of the most revolutionary hip-hop albums ever. Overall Blackout! is a great disc and highly worth the purchase.comer Ja Rule has a lot to show us over the next years.

B00004XQP4|1.0|Sorry, but this album is actually quite awful.  Firstly, I luv these guys; I thought Insomniac was great when people were dumping all over them.  Nimrod was a bit more progressive, but still enjoyable.  On Warning: There's only one song (besides the single, Minority) that I found listenable.  Sheesh, there's almost a polka on there.  Sure the masses want progression etc., but lest ye not forget GD is supposed to be a punk band (I'm not going to get into the whole punk ethos here).  I would say progress with the lyrics and the arrangements, but the guitar is almost non-existant (sounds like blue-grass).  Oh well, the new Offspring is coming out.  This album is definitely passble.
0385495323|5.0|That a well written book on cryptography should sell is no surprise, but what impressed me was Singh's brilliance at bringing the reader along easily as the text ventures into more and more complex matter.  Great teachers have mastered the technique of taking the student from where he is to where the teacher wants him to be.  Singh is so talented at this that one could pass a test under him as teacher without doing any homework.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|It's about time someone made an american version of Das Boot, this movie is non stop action with a fairly unique action plot as compared to the run of the mill Arnold specials.  Check this movie out if you want something a little different that won't bore you to death.  If you want to hear Kissinger talk about the British saving us all by finding the enigma machine check out the local VFW or the history channel.  Otherwise, crank up the volume and enjoy!

6300213714|5.0|I have to say I was in the 5th or 6th grade when I saw this movie.  I have probably seen it over 100 times and I never get tired of seeing it.  I annoy the hell out of everyone around me because I recite the dialogue word for word.  I just want to say to one of the earlier comments that the television version does have quite a bit of extra footage including the expanded opening sequence.  I also want to plea to Walter Hill and Paramount to please release this movie on DVD, a directors cut with the extra footage and commentary.  I would be the first in line to get it!
B00003CXDG|3.0|The opening sequence of the movie sets the tone for the movie.  We are introduced to a buffed-up, shaggy-haired Tom Cruise climbing the vertical face of a rocky cliff in the middle of some barren landscape.  It is a beautiful, breath taking, death-defying ballet, but it is an entirely solo act.  The premise of the television series was that a group of skilled government operatives would be brought in based on their specialties and orchestrate a complex mission.  The first MI movie actually showed some of this spirit in the opening embassy sequence, but lost its steam as the complexity of the plot wore that movie out.<br />MI:2 is basically all Tom Cruise all the time.  He drives, he fights, he dons disguise after disguise, he jumps, he kicks, he hides, and does all those things that action stars do.  Sure, there are a couple of support agents, but one is a glorified chauffeur, and the other just looks at a computer screen and looks worried.  The plot is standard action movie fare.  Bad guy, a former MI operative himself, wants to get his hands on a ultra-deadly toxin and its vaccine.  He plans to use it to demand billions from Australia, and the only one who can stop him is Mr. Cruise.  The key lies with a former lover of the villain.  A jewel thief, played by the beautiful Thandie Newton, she is recruited by Mr. Cruise, and they both promptly fall in love.  Much mayhem and destruction follow, as well as the predictable twists and turns, which climax in a mano-a-mano between hero and villain.<br />The movie bears the hallmarks of the direction, noted Hong Kong action filmmaker John Woo.  There are the beautifully choreographed gun fights, the use of slow motion to enhance the drama and the mood of the characters, as well as the requisite doves flying in slow motion.  The special effects are par for the course, with plenty of explosions, bullets and locations that seemed to have been built for the sole purpose of being destroyed during gun fights.  One special effectthat is particularly effective (until it is used for the upteenth time) is the removal of masks.  It is truly fantastic what a leap in technology we have from MI:1's mask removal sequence and MI:2's mask scenes.<br />All in all, it is an average action movie that strays too far from the more cerebral Mission Impossible roots to land squarely in James Bond territory - there is even an M like character portrayed by Sir Anthony Hopkins.
0399146253|4.0|Kay Scarpetta does not kill Le Loup-Garou, as evidenced by his continual presence throught The Last Precinct. I would suggest that only readers familiar with the revisited cast read this book. You will not understand the dynamics of the realtionships played out in this novel. While Black Notice was not her best book, it took us through the dark places we expect people to visit after murder touches their lives, along with the introduction of new, hateful characters that I'm sure will pop up time and again as did Carrie Grethren.  The Last Precint shows the mending of the souls of our familiar cast. It is not as entertaining as her previous books but it was necessary for Cornwell to create closure for her characters. I am pleased with the turn Cornwell is alowing Kay Scarpetta to take in her career.  With her realization of her own damaged psyche and her practice of creating angst ridden relationships she will no doubt be a more compelling character in the next book.  I do hope with all my heart that Pete Marino, by far the most likeable character in her series, will not get lost in the shuffle. I feel this book was a gift to fans of the series. We previously have been privy to every nuance of the two main characters. They were 'profiled' for us as we knew every move they would take. We are now left wondering if there will be a change in Kays and Petes relationship, will there be a change of venue? My interest is already piqued. The Last Precint was a book that I could simply not put down as each page brought a new plot twist.  Was it her best work? No.  But it was a good read, especially for series fans.  I am certainly looking forward to the next installment.  I am sure that Patricia Cornwell will hit her stride and give us a good time getting to know the new Kay Scarpetta.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I think 1999 was one of the best years for cinema in a very long time.  In fact, I cannot remember a better year.  Every year I write a &quot;Top 10 Films of the Year&quot; article.  In 1999, I had to do fifteen and I still had to make cuts that I didn't want to.  But &quot;American Beauty&quot; was put at the top of my list without a second thought.<br />This is a movie about modern American life, about desire, about unhappiness, about love, lust, sin, and redemption.  This film gives me chills every single time I see it, no lie.  It is funny, sad, uplifting, and all too true.  The tagline &quot;Look Closer&quot; sums it up perfectly.  You never know what's going on behind your neighbors picket fences.<br />The performances in this film are top notch.  Kevin Spacey IS Lester Burnham.  He makes me believe in his characters motivations and actions.  Annette  Benning is absolutely brilliant.  Chris Cooper is utterly amazing and Wes Bentley is (to use an overdone term) a revelation.  And I do not believe that Mena Suvari got nearly enough attention for her performance.<br />The script is dead on perfect.  Brilliant themes, perfect pacing, funny, and enthralling.  I cannot wait to see what Alan Ball turns out next.  The cinematography is beautiful.  Every shot is a work of art.  The lighting, the colors, its perfect!<br />Sam Mendes masterfully helms this picture.  He uses great restraint and controls what could so easily get out of hand like a true master.<br />See this movie.  See this movie NOW!  You won't regret it, I promise.
B00004XOWM|4.0|This cd is pretty good. The songs are high energy but it still didnt capture the sound on the first album. Limp has gone pop, but the songs on this cd are still decent. yah.
0790734850|5.0|This is film noir at it's best, rivaled only  by  The Maltese Falcon. A smart film revolving around 3 cops, a call girl and the sleezy tabloid writer with his finger on the pulse of LA. The characters are beautifully developed and played. Spacey is slick and corrupt, Pearce is the ambitious one and Crowe is a time bomb waiting for the right moment to explode. Kim Basinger exudes the sexy 50's starlet type role. James Cromwell as the corrupt police captain is equally compelling as he plays the  three cops  against eachother to dangerous ends. A slick smart film that will hold your attention from begining to end.  It is a must have for any film fan!
0380804557|1.0|There are only so many things to say about this book.  It is a trivial little story about nothing.  Though it may have some value as a multi-part comic book, it has no value as a true book.  Having read most of Gaiman's works (Neverwhere, Sandmans [as the came out, mind you, not one of those who came later and thought they were in on it], his short fictions in multiple collections, etc.), I was looking forward to reading this book, which I had passed over when it came out (annoyed by the many reprintings of Sandman).  But finally monthes ago I got to it and it was wretched.  There is nothing good about this book, no nothing at all.  It is a childish pulp book.  Though it may be better than that fool Harry Potter and Oprah's book club, it is not good for Neil Gaiman.
B000002UWL|5.0|Behavior is a beautiful album about youth, fame, love, loneliness, and AIDS. It's the first album where Neil Tennant spoke his feelings, and he does so with class and style. It was the culmination of the PSB sound and craft - Neil Tennant's wistful vocals amidst a shiny backdrop of swooshing analog synths and blowing winds. It captures the boys at a crossroads in their life, having dealt with fame, loss, and middle age. All throughout the album, there's a sense of waiting, waiting for something to happen, waiting for someone to say the words \\"I love you\\". It'll remind you of a memorable time in your youth, of a bittersweet lost love.

B00003CXE7|2.0|I was very disappointed in this film from Scott.  I have liked most of his films.  I didn't think the action scenes were that impressive.  The first battle, you couldn't see what was going on in it.  Russell Crowe's character was never really challenged throughout the film.  I did think Crowe did a good job in the film.  It was to expected after standout performances in LA Confidential and The Insider.  The story just did not draw me in.  Everything looked too easy for Crowe's character (I know I am repeating myself here).  It is just disheartening when a good director and a good actor get together and they make a mediocre film.  A similar film is Braveheart.  Braveheart is a much better film than this.  That film thrust you into the battle scenes and made you care about William Wallace.  That film had heart, while this film seemed cold and distant.  I am sure Scott and Crowe will bounce back with their next projects.
B00000255O|4.0|&quot;Man-Child&quot; may not be filled with as many hooks as &quot;Headhunters&quot;, &quot;Sextant&quot;, or &quot;Thrust&quot;, but it is still an essential record for fans of Herbie or true electronic funk.  &quot;Hang Up Your Hang Ups&quot; has one of the best get-you-going intros with its incessant guitar.  As expected, Herbie has a lot of sound effects that he puts to good use, maybe not as crazy as &quot;Headhunters&quot; but spacey nonetheless.  This is more of a commercially inclined record, but it still has its share of tempo changes and showcases.  Stevie Wonder blows out an amazing harmonica solo on &quot;Steppin' In It&quot; and there is a killer bass solo on &quot;The Traitor&quot;.  The album ends with &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, a dark tune that alternates between a brooding stomp and a funky shuffle; it closes the album on a somber note.<br />Each song averages 8-9 minutes.  There are a multitude of players on this record and its evident by the busy styles you hear.  Worth checking out if electric funk is your thing.
B0000033RY|5.0|This is a 'greatest hits' album. I own two copies of this CD so I can have one in the house, at work, lent out, or in the car.  I have two other Cactus albums on vinyl, Cactus and One Way or Another.  I also have two other CDs, One Way or Another and Hot n Sweaty.  I used to have Restrictions on 8 track long ago which was my introduction to them.  I would recommend any Cactus to Boomer/Gen-x people as well as the younger listner as an excellent representation of quintessential non-pop of the early 70's (not to be confused with the late 70's which seems to define the 70's these days).  These guys were one of the original alternative/boogie rock bands in rock history.  The material, although somewhat derivative, comes from a myriad of sources, synthesized into a unique sound.  If you like a kick in the pants while you drive, then this album is for you. While some material is a little dated, the majority of it stands the test of time as well written.  In its day, it was extremely innovated and ahead of its time back when this genere was known as progressive rock.
079073463X|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time about a week ago and I liked it a lot. The only things that bothered me were the music, and Michelle Pfeiffer's short hair. If she had had long hair and if the music were more &quot;medieval&quot; sounding then it would be perfect. About the movie... I won't write a summary of the plot, because several people have done so already, but if you like medieval romances, watch this movie. You will probably want to buy it. Also, I am surprised I haven't heard of this movie before, being that it has famous actors (Pfeiffer, Broderick) but it should be famous.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|Maybe I'm giving this CD a preliminary review. Bjork's stuff, more than any other artist, has to grow on you. It demands multiple listenings. I haven't listened to this album repeatedly like i have with Post and Homogenic, but Bjork really scores with a sort of techno musical, really modern and inventive. I saw the movie a few weeks ago, and liked it... maybe if you see the movie first and then listen to the CD you will have a different opinion. Can't wait for her new studio album next year.
B00004XONN|4.0|Wow, this would have made a great soundtrack to fight club(not saying the dust brothers did a bad job). This new Radiohead album is amazing when you consider the songs themselves and the production. Although different from their past albums,in kid A it appears that radiohead is almost trying to break away from the norm and write songs that hold no boundaries or rules.It breaks away from the typical pop- rock cycle we've become so familiar with and they create something that I feel goes much deeper, so deep we will not all love it right away, but like fine wine we'll have to aquire the taste because although different its beauty shouldn't be ignored.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Limp Bizkit's third album &quot;Chocolate Starfish And The Hotdog Flavored Water&quot; is a really phenomenal work. It's even better than its predecessor &quot;Significant Other&quot; which already could be considered a masterpiece.<br />The album starts with such furious tracks as &quot;Hot Dog&quot; (features *extremely* explicit lyrics) and the smash-single &quot;My Generation&quot; followed by the rythmic &quot;Full Nelson&quot;. Then the relatively relaxed &quot;My Way&quot; gives the audience a chance to breath. After that &quot;Rollin' (air raid vehicle)&quot;, probably the best track on this CD, takes it away again. Later on there's the remarkable &quot;Take A Look Around&quot; a.k.a. the Mission Impossible 2 theme.<br />In spite of all this praise there are, however, two weakpoints on this album: &quot;Hold On&quot;, which I must admit is a quite lame song and the ridiculous outro. But that's it.<br />&quot;Chocolate Startfish And The Hotdog Flavored Water&quot; is a well-done mixture of metal rock, hiphop and alternative. It has metal influences than Limp Bizkit's previous album but hiphop passages have not become less. Make sure you turn up volume and bass to the max when you listen to this brillant work!
630471193X|3.0|i think this is a pretty good movie i actually went to see it two weeks in a row when it was out at the movies.now i own the tape.travolta gives a good performance.as does everyone else.i disaggre with the other viewres who said that this is one of the best movies of all time its not that great.Intersting factoid. david gallgher who plays sedwicks son. also start with travolta in look whos talking now.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|The extremely heavy-handed hollywood style made parts unwatchable - the worst being the German destroyer ( I don't think the Germans had destroyers ) dropping 2 depth charges every 20 seconds as they cruised along, but the people in the sub were having to endure 10 of them blowing up in a 10 second period, and all of them too close to survive. If you want a sub flic, see Das Boot.
B00003CXCT|5.0|When I first saw the movie &quot;Star Wars&quot; I was like &quot;wow&quot;! Who would of known that the next 2 would be as good as it. Usually when a sequel is created from a movie, it is almost never as good as the first, but George Lucas managed to pull it off. Take this for instance- If you were watching A New Hope right now, not knowing when it was made, when would you guess that it was made? It was so far ahead of its time, a 1977 movie!! The movie is suspenseful! It was very clever in the Death Star trench scene. Never have I seen a better ended movie. George Lucas took what he had and turned this movie into one of the most popular movies of all time. You don't need a movie run by computers to make a great movie. This is one of my favorites! If you are into science fiction, this movie is for you!
014028009X|5.0|I loved this book!  I fell in love with Bridgett and missed her for weeks after I was done reading.  I told my best friend about it and she loved it as much as I did, she was in hawaii when she finished reading it, and went all over the island looking for 'The Edge of Reason' to continue the story.  Bridgett is soooo funny, her adventures made me laugh so hard that I cried!  I wish Helen Fielding would write a third book.  If you read The diary you have to read The Edge of Reason, it's even better!
B00003CX5P|2.0|Let me start off by saying that The Phantom Menace is an OK movie. Sure the graphics are amazing in this movie, but doesn't it seem that it might get a little boring if the special effects swallow the almost the WHOLE MOVIE?! There were not those suspenseful, dramatic, romantic parts in this movie. Take The Empire Strikes Back for instance. It was made in 1980 when there wasn't near the technology for special effects then, and STILL it was one of the most popular movies OF ALL TIME! So does there have to be that many computerized stuff in a movie to make it great? To me, there were too many annoying characters (Jar Jar Binks). If you are in to the special effects of the movie this IS the movie for you. If you are like me and actually want to have a good story in a movie, watch the original trilogy. They need to spend more time thinking of the story rather than finding effects that would impress the audience.
B000031WD9|1.0|For some reason, this movie didn't make me laugh out loud. It didn't even make me crack a smile. What's so funny about seeing a person screw a pie? I didn't understand why every teenager in the entire world calls this &quot;one of the best movies ever&quot;. I personally thought it was non-stop immaturity and gave out bad messages to teens (i.e. sex has no reprocussions). If you're looking to be grossed out by a bunch of raunchy oversexed people, go for it, but if you want to remain mature and take your comedy on a different level, avoid this movie.
B000001Y42|5.0|So since this is a classic, I'm gona rate every song.<br />1. Intro- Bizarre, but cool<br />2. Pollution- What a song to start off with! Once you hear it, you'll be blown away!<br />3. Counterfeit- Cool song, one of my favs.<br />4. Stuck- My 2nd favorite.<br />5. Nobody Loves Me- Kinda cool, kinda annoying.<br />6. Sour- Awesome song. Its got that mad kinda Fred Durst.<br />7. Stalemate- My Fav! Very cool song with a great beat.<br />8. Clunk- Average.<br />9. Faith- The best cover song I've ever heard<br />10. Stuck Finger- Bizzare.<br />11. Indigo Flow- Too rap untill the end when it gets cool<br />12. Leech- Loud, but loud is good!<br />13. Everything- Good past the 15:00 mark<br />So basically, this is a classic!
6305776326|5.0|Being a Catholic school girl for so many years (and I still am!), this movie cracked me up. Molly Shannon and Will Ferrel are hilarious. A must see for anyone who enjoys SNL.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is the CD. Any hard rock fans, this is it. An excellent CD, from song 2 (song 1 is an annoying intro) up. Highlights of this CD are &quot;(sic)&quot;, &quot;Eyeless&quot;, &quot;Surfacing&quot;, &quot;Spit It Out&quot; and the secret song after song 14. This CD is for any rock fan in the world!! Buy it today!
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is a must be for any fan of hard rock and heavy meatl. It just simply Kicks ASS!!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|I very nearly did not watch this one, I bungee jumped head-first into the conclusion that it would be about some macho guys fighting to determine who was the most macho. I was so wrong. Edward Norton plays the main protagonist, a cubicle worker for a large corporation, a man who's so devoid of life-force he can only find peace by attending self-help groups for the terminally ill. On a business trip he meets Tyler Durden, an easy-going salesman. They find that fighting - simply fighting, with no animosity or purpose - fulfills a need within themselves. Others join them, until they eventually have a club as fascist and mindless as the corporations they scorn. Along the way, the plot delves into some very dark and masochistic places, and the surrealistic story not so much draws us in, as forcibly abducts us, and we are played with, teased, and disturbed. The acting through-out is excellent. Brad Pitt completely becomes the charismatic Durden, who serves as our guide to this warped Underworld. Helena Bonham Carter is the morbid and trashy Marla Singer, a kind of groupie to the dying. Another excellent job was done by Meatloaf. There is a lot of pain here, but the pain and ugliness gives rise to black and sardonic humour, and by the end every last part of my soul, no matter how hard and critical, had been touched.<br />The questions this story asks are disturbing. How much pain are we inflicting on ourselves in order to feel alive? Are our comfortable modern lives at odds with, and at risk of being destroyed by, our innate need for struggle? When we reject one set of values do we fall prey to another? Oddly enough, given the violent theme and the black humour, there is no meanness here, and the characters are not set up to be made fun of, (which I felt was the case in American Beauty), nor do they need our sympathy. There is no intent on the part of the characters to destroy life, but rather to destroy that which prevents us from experiencing life. I loved it, I loved being held hostage by it, and I am grateful to the artists who made it.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This album is the best yet. it's just beautiful. I love what Fred and the guys have done on this album. I don't know what it is but they just keep getting better and better. The only song that i didn't really like is Hotdog because he uses the F word about 50 times. I also really like what they have done with Rollin. The rock version and the rap version are phat. I like how they always make something for everybody. This is a must have!
B00004STPT|4.0|In a period of lackluster movie soundtrack releases, &quot;Gladiator&quot; shines brightly and magnificently.  Its blend of ethereal, haunting movements and glorious, epic, sturm amd drang make for the most interesting and fulfilling music heard on the big screen in years.  Holst was definitely on the mind of someone when this score was conceptualized as was Gorecki ( the beginning of track 14 is eerily akin to the 1st movement of Gorecki's Symphony of Sorrowful Songs ).  The use of Lisa Gerrard was nothing short of genius as her ethereal, otherwordly voice brought a sense of antiquity to the film.  In my estimation, a good soundtrack will arouse images from a film; a great one will bring forth the emotions intimately tied to the individual scenes and the film as a whole.  This soundtrack is clearly the latter- it moved me and made me feel the despair, heartache ( track 5 ) and glory of Rome.  I give it a four only because I think Zimmer &quot;lifted&quot; a few too many ideas for his score.......but I can't fault him much.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|Movie is highly suspensful, lots of action, and has a pretty decent plot.  The tension runs high throughout the movie, and the special effects are excellent.  Acting is pretty decent, and you can feel yourself pulling for the main characters.<br />Ignore people complaining about how this movie rewrites history; Hollywood was making a movie for American audiences and used Americans. Their job is to make money not make historians and Britains happy.  If you want the real thing watch The History Channel.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is the tightest Limp cd yet!Probably the tightest tracks are the 2 rollins.Buy this cd cuz its off da hook!
B00004U8PA|5.0|I loved this movie soooo much! Tim Curry is hilarious! However, this movie isn't for everyone. It starts out with the Goody Goody all American geeks- Brad and Janet getting engaged and going to see Dr. Everett Scott, a friend. On the way to see him they get a flat tire and end up in the isane mansion of Frank-N-Furter. Where he and his fellow transylvanias are holding a convention for transylvanians. As the night goes on all sorts of crazy things go on. This movie is fun and catchy. I recommend it to anyone who likes cheesy films, like me.
B0000025BL|5.0|This album has sold more than 35 million copies worldwide, and it continues to sell aproximatley 200.000 copies each year.  There is a very simple reason to it's succes: It is one of the greatest albums of all time and of all genres!  Do yourself a favor and buy this album. You'll never stop listening to it - no matter what age, gender, religious belief you may have. If one album can unite the world and bring us peace, it's this one... :)
B000001DTM|5.0|It is hard to say which album is U2's best.  Their foray from standard rock into more atmospheric music when they did Unforgettable Fire is as abrupt as their move from The Joshua tree era into Achtung Baby.  Each album they have released has its own peculiarities and beauty that makes it unique in its won right.<br />Nonetheless, this is U2's most PUBLIC change, a change from the 80's rock icons they were into a dark, loud, postmodern, self-mocking band that showers the listener with a storm of soaring sounds.<br />This is their best album in my opinion as U2 have pulled out all the stops and in being ironic and sarcastic, they somehow bear their heart more than in any album.  The yearning sadness of One, the suffering of Love is Blindness, the proclamation and exaltation of change in Zoo Station.  Each song is a textured symphony that is rock at its best.<br />Lyrically, this is also a triumph for Bono.  Phrases like &quot;Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief, they kill their inspiration and sing about their grief&quot; (The Fly) are startling in what he is implying.  The anthemic words &quot;We're one, but we're not the same, we get to carry each other&quot; from One have captivated millions of hearts that still break when they hear the song today at concerts.<br />This is perhaps the best rock and roll album ever put out by the best rock and roll band ever.  To steal a quote, all bands following U2 are mere footnotes to their great works.
B00000634J|5.0|We all must admit, John Lennon knew what he was doing.  He made good music.  All the songs on this CD standout as good, but some more than others.  Tracks 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 standout as his best works.  Some of the songs like &quot;Instant Karma,&quot; &quot;Whatever Gets You Through The Night,&quot; and &quot;#9 Dream&quot; just don't do anything for me.  Track 6, &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; is an awesome song except for the two minute ending of John groaning.  Obviously, &quot;Imagine&quot; is the best track, but don't forget about &quot;Working Class Hero.&quot;  &quot;Mother,&quot; &quot;Jealous Guy,&quot; and &quot;Love&quot; are my other favorites of the whole CD.  You can really hear the emotion behind these three songs.  This CD is definately worth it, even if Yoko Ono gets the money.  Buy it now if you don't have it.
0060977493|5.0|What a strange and wonderful book this is!  It is written in a style that is diarming at first, yet captivates the heart.  The characters are believable and yet have a haze of mytique about them all that is the stuff of legends.<br />Roy narrates a story that is packed with sadness and tragedy.  The love between a brother and sister that is broken by so much pain is aching in its intensity and power.  As the story of abuse unfolds in its frank and shocking way, one can only sit back and scream at the inhumanity of those who harm little children.<br />There is no question that the narrative style of Roy's writing is difficult at first, but it has a rhythm, a cadence that you have to slide into and become part of.  Then the story becomes a part of you.

B00004YKUX|4.0|This is a truly moving album - full of wisdom and wonder, wit and world-weariness. It starts off in an almost poppy vein with the folky twang of Tom Petty, but all to soon the real mood of the album comes through with the spectacularly moving double whammy of i see a darkness and the mercy seat. These two troubled prayers to God and death are the highlight of the album. Maybe the highlight of Cash's career.  Its an awesome album in every respect. Hell, it even makes a U2 song listenable.
B000002UCN|3.0|If you like Harrison, but not necessarily the Beatles, this is for you.  It has all his memorable Beatles' songs and then his solo work up to about 1976.  But that was 15 years ago.  What are we to do today wi th his other works?  I suggest that a new compilation be made, sans the Beatles stuff.  Put all his best solo works in one compilation and you will have a 5-star album.  But, like I said, if you're a Harrison fan like me, buy this for now, if you don't have any of his albums.  &quot;Bangla Desh&quot; is an increidbly powerful song.  &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; &quot;Give Me Love&quot; and &quot;What Is Life&quot; are also good songs.  &quot;You&quot; isn't.  It seems too commercial for my liking.  Think Backstreet Boys.  &quot;Dark Horse&quot; is a good song, but George sounds like he his throat is a little &quot;hoarse.&quot;  If you don't have much money and want Harrison stuff, buy this, its a good place to start.  But I suggest buying his solo albums separately.
B000002H4C|1.0|The rock in this is as annoying as the OST to LADYHAWKE-just there to keep the&quot;kids&quot; happy-the dummies; The symphonic score has far more beauty-it has a truly epic, sweeping mythical quality about it; In 1980, along with the film, two OST LPs came out: the ROCK soundtrack, and the SYMPHONIC Music by Bernstein; Too bad we cant have that today on CD...BTW the SONGS on HM2000 are much better. The MUSIC is OK, but not as good as EB's Score...
0451191153|5.0|Many pseudo-intellectuals think they are geniuses for being able to read a book of this length.  I am no intellectual by far but have read many books on philosophy.  I believe this book to be one of the most important pieces for people of any age.  This book puts life in perspective.  It shows, quite cleverly, that there are rewards beyond materialistic ones.  It also shows that greatness is not necessarily what others believe it to be but what the creator gets out of it.  I first read Atlas Shrugged at the suggestion of my brother.  I read it in about 3 days, seldom putting it down.  I went on to read every novel written by Rand.  I think that she is a very important author of our time and whether you believe in her philosophies or not you must read it.
B000002U9W|5.0|This album is great to those of us who like a little of everything in our music.  The title track is a good combination of classical and rock.  At the time of this recording there weren't too many groups doing arrangements like this.  It is simple but very pleasing to any hardcore fan of The Floyd.  Track 2 - &quot;If&quot; is a good example of Roger Water's music to this date.  Although it's not one of my favorites, it's still worth listening to.  Track 3 - &quot;Summer of '68&quot; is a really good upbeat melody.  Very nice piano work and lyrics.  Track 4 - &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; is my secon favorite of the album.  Although the album version is a little dull, it still has a nice feel to it.  Just goes to show that David Gilmour can write good music.  Track 5 - &quot;Alans Psychedelic Breakfast ....&quot; Is to me probably a little bit of a waste, but that's only my opinion.  <br />This album is worth a listen to.  Try it, you'll like it.
0399146253|4.0|Kay Scarpetta is recovering from a run-in with Jean-Baptiste Chandonne (featured in the previous novel &quot;Black Notice&quot;. It seems Chandonne is the suspect in the werewolf killings that Scarpetta has been investigating, but as she and Marino look further into the killings they see the murders have traveled to New York City.<br />When brought in for questioning, Chandonne, spins a wild story about his being &quot;framed&quot;.<br />Scarpetta must unravel every thread of his story to find out if he is actually telling the truth, or is there a sinister plan behind his story, before any more women are murdered.<br />&quot;The Last Precinct&quot; is a slow starting novel, but when the action kicks into gear (about 160 pages into the book) it cooks, readers will be forced to turn pages to find the outcome of the story, as well as what will become of the novel's characters (Scarpetta, Marino, and Lucy).<br />Patricia Cornwell brings &quot;Scarpetta&quot; into the millenium, in a novel that boils with suspense...One of the better novels in the series.<br />Nick Gonnella
630512762X|1.0|Obviously the &quot;action movie&quot; audience is very much lacking in anything resembling standards.  I rented this film after being told how &quot;awesome&quot; it was.  I found myself alternately laughing at it or wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he made it.  The whole premise of the film is a joke.  Switching faces?  PLEASE!  By the time they got to where Nicholas Cage was hanging on to the side of speedboat, basically waterskiing without WATERSKIS, I was laughing so hard my sides hurt.  I had expected better after Broken Arrow, which, while quite DUMB, was at least entertaining.  I only hope this review will save some poor innocent from buying this monstrosity.
0790731002|3.0|Joel Schumacher takes over the Batman franchise in this episode in which Batman takes on the Riddler &amp; Two-Face, while taking on a crime-fighting partner in Robin.  Despite the brighter colors and air of campiness, there are enough dark moments to make this a fun film.  Val Kilmer is a solid Batman, while Jim Carrey channels Frank Gorshin in his take of the Riddler.  Chris O'Donnell has the right attitude as Robin.  Unfortunately, Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face is completely underdeveloped, while Nichole Kidman is just there for decoration.  Unfortunately, Schumacher would completely abandon Batman's dark elements and create a disaster in the film after this...BATMAN &amp; ROBIN.  That said, this particular film is entertaining, despite it's flaws.  Recommended
B00004XOWM|5.0|Well, I guess I'm the first one to review this CD... I'm sitting here listening to it, and there's do doubt that this CD is great. It's got the same style, beats, and guitars that you'd expect from that red baseball cap wearin' frak Fred, Lethal, and the rest of the crew. The star of the CD is definitely the &quot;Rollin' Urban Assault Vehicle&quot; remix of &quot;Rollin&quot; that features DMX, Method Man and Redman. DMX just can't be touched and Wu-Tang lives on... Also, an interesting note is th additional production and writing that went into some songs from none other than Scott Weiland from STP. The songs he worked on, at least &quot;Hold On&quot; that he co-wrote with Fred, definitely have his touch, with a melodic guitar and his vocals reminiscent of one of STP's lighter songs from the &quot;Purple&quot; album. Fred and Scott even harmonize surprisingly well (I'm having Alice in Chains flashbacks...). Anyway, the reason this only got 4 stars, is that it seems to me that the lyrics aren't as good as those from &quot;Significant Other&quot;. But the more I think about it... in fact, no I just changed it to 5... for the creativity of having the rough songs like &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Hot Dog&quot;, with the melodic sounds of &quot;Hold On&quot;, and the hip hop touch of the &quot;Rollin&quot; remix. This CD is still rockin with awesome beats, but still keeping that hard edge Limp Bizkit fans crave. Excellent CD.
6305075468|5.0|Despite the German names, this is the classic silent version of DRACULA.  Max Schreck makes a perfectly creepy Dracula, called Orlock in this film, with his rat-like face, elongated hands, and looming shadows.  This is a classic example of German Expressionism in film.  The tinting and sharpness of the print makes this a silent film treasure to enjoy. The audio commentary is also very helpful for the film student.  If you like silent films, this is one I highly recommend.
B00004XONN|5.0|Would people please stop whining about Kid A.  If this album dissapoints you, you are not really listening; you're simply trying to place a template for what you think rock music is over an album that is a creative depature from any model. Kid A is an engaging album that presents a different way of creating music and musical effects.  The results of this effort are truly original, captivating, emotional and painfully beautiful.  Every track has something to offer on its own and as part of the whole.  So please don't complain; rather, try listening to the album without comparing it to other Radiohead albums.  It simply isn't &quot;another&quot; Radiohead album; because Radiohead has not and will not just make &quot;another&quot; album.  If you listen to the music and let it stand on its own as a creative expression, then you will enjoy Kid A for what it is: an extremely satisfying and enjoyable piece of art.  My advice: Don't think. Listen.
B0000507UD|5.0|This LIMP BIZKIT album is by far the best one so far just listening to it if you are a LIMP fan is music in a class of its own and its not a class to be messed with. The album appears to be a combination of the two previous albums. For example some of the songs have very raw guitaring like the first LIMP album with a calmer singing tone to it like the 2nd album and vice versa. Overall this album is not one to be messed with a definate 5 stars with not a hint of doubt!!
0783240503|5.0|I watch &quot;Joseph&quot; about once a week, and I love every moment of it!!  The music, the cast, the costumes, everything is superb.  It's wonderful to see a Bible story I learned about in Sunday School as a kid given the full Andrew Lloyd Webber stage treatment.  Whenever I watch it, I can't help but sing along (I know most of the words by now--scary!).  Donny Osmond is the perfect Joseph.  He has an excellent voice and is very convincing as he goes from happy go-lucky innocence in the beginning to a mature leader at the end.  And the brothers are hilarious.  Their facial expressions are worth the price of the video alone!  This musical will definitely leave a smile on your face.
B00004XOWM|5.0|i first heard limp bizkit's 3 dollar bill yall which blew me away, with rap and metal. then came there significant other which was dope with break stuff and nookie but not as heavy as the original. now chocolate starfish and the hotdog flavored water, which was both of them together with heavy tracks like &quot;hotdog&quot;, &quot;full nelson&quot;, and &quot;livin' it up&quot;. and songs like &quot;re-arranged&quot; but better lyrics and phatter beats like &quot;the one&quot; and &quot;my way&quot;.If you liked both or just one of there past cds, it has something for everyone   buy this cd you won't regret it
B00004XOWM|4.0|I think that is isnt as good as Significant Other. But it is good!
1878424114|5.0|The ideas presented in this book are so interesting and yet so simple, it's common sense.  I recommend you to summarize the 7 laws and print them, so you can remember to apply them.  That's what I've done and it's working.
B000002JAX|5.0|I have been searching for this CD since last year, when I first heard Ms. Peyroux on FUV/Fordham University Radio Sta. - I love any Billy Holiday music, but,when I heard this great voice and then saw her on a cable sta., I was overjoyed.  The CD is great and I am purchasing at least 4 more this year and giving them as gifts for the holidays.  Pls. tell Ms. Peyroux that there are people out there who want more music from her, Please!!  When I listen to her CD, it's the 40's all over again, I love it.
0060919760|5.0|This book changed my life.  After I read it, I moved to another city, got another job, and started thinking in a more open, optimistic way.  It was a great help!
B00004XOWM|5.0|We all knew that &quot;Rollin'&quot; and &quot;My Generation&quot; were amazing when we heard them on the radio or we saw the video on TV, but the whole album is a smash. &quot;Hot Dog&quot; and &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot; stand out as incredible options for the next single. I suggest that you get this album because it is the definative L.I.M.P Bizkit!
B00000AOUD|5.0|Although it is easy to lump Thick As A Brick with all the other progressive conceptual albums of the era, this masterpiece stands apart from the others by adopting a refreshingly tongue-in-cheek attitude mixed with a bitingly cerebral commentary on the nature of english society.<br />The music is beautiful, delicate acoustic textures and lilting flute melodies giving form and substance to the wittiest Tull lyrics ever penned by Anderson (under the pseudonym of 8 year old prodigy Gerald Bostock, no less), and though the overall effect is epic, it never becomes pretentious or tiring. When Ian Anderson steps up to the plate, accesible progressive rock is an oxymoron no longer.<br />But the icing on the cake is this new remastered edition. The quality of the recording is such that it makes my remastered editions of ELP's Tarkus or Foxtrot by Genesis (both albums from more or less the same era) sound lo-fi. Let the critics argue which album is better than which; audiophiles will have no trouble choosing which one SOUNDS better. The live track, previously availabe on the 20th anniversary video, is absolutely spectacular, albeit a somewhat inferior sound as far as the vocal track goes. And then you get an interview... wow!!<br />Perhaps Mr. Anderson intended this album as a spoof, but it is in fact a masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and buy it.
630575067X|5.0|Well, it was not what I expected, but then again I was remembering the thrill of seeing Star Wars for the first time on the large screen at age 12.  It was a good movie, and the special effects were fantastic though.
B000001FTQ|5.0|Its a good EP if you're willing to pay an above-average price for it.  If you like Bad, and you should :), go download Bad from Live Aid.   Like others have said, its breath-taking.  Also check out Bad from London (with Jeff Shankar I believe, 1993?), and also live from Rattle and Hum.  Anyhow, Wide Awake is definitely a worthy EP.
B00000DGUY|5.0|listen to the old versions of these songs, then listen to the remastered versions...big big improvement.  especially cool if you have a cd player with HDCD capability.  the only song that's missing is 'down to the waterline'. :)
B00004Z400|5.0|The Deftones are arguably one of the most original, creative and bold forces for music currently on the planet.  So I must ask,  why oh why oh WHY did they re-release this classic album with this extra track.  White Pony stands out because it gets the Tones out of that rap metal crap genre now populated by losers such as Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach.  Was this something to get the kiddies on TRL interested in buying the CD by pandering to their tastes?  I know these guys need to make money, but Jesus.  I was really starting to place Deftones up there with the godlike Radiohead.  But now....
B00004XOWM|5.0|This album surpasses theie last one.cuts like get cha groove one withxzibit keep the hip hoppers happy and hard songs like boiler keep the metal kids happy.  much more effort seems to have been put in this and it has paied off, big time.
0684853523|4.0|You probably need to be two things to get the most out of this book--a writer and a Stephen King fan. ON WRITING is aptly sub-titled &quot;A Memoir of the Craft,&quot; and it's just that--part autobiography, part how-to manual for aspiring writers.<br />The first part of King's book is the most readable. He discusses how he came to the craft, and the background that formed him as the world famous writer he is today. By turns hilarious and emotionally moving, ON WRITING is a rollercoaster of a book--but like any rollercoaster, it's a fun ride.<br />The part of this book that deals mostly with writing techniques is the most disappointing. We expect to learn something new and amazing, but King doesn't provide any trade secrets and, despite his opening statement declaring his wish to pen something that wouldn't be just another &quot;how to write&quot; book, ON WRITING takes a turn for the worse and becomes just that. What redeems this section is King's style. You'll get the feeling you're sitting across from him, collecting writing tips while he turns on his Yankee charm. <br />The real flaw with ON WRITING is that this book doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up. Is it a memoir? Is it a how-to book? Is it a rant? Whatever it is, it's a good read--one any writer will enjoy.
0345350499|2.0|I felt this book (and series) were quite overrated. I like only a few fantasy books/series, and love a lot less. This was definitely not one of the books that impacted me.<br />Although the book starts out well, it grows increasingly stale after that. The Arthurian legends have been incorporated into so many fantasy books that a book has to really execute fresh ideas in order to stand out from the crowd. None of the characters are particularly well drawn either.<br />If you really love Arthurian legends and can't get enough of them (is there anyone really like that) maybe you might want to read this book. Otherwise, i wouldn't recommend it, to fantasy fans or newcomers.
B00003CWPL|5.0|If only one film had to be chosen to show in film school, this would have to be on the top of the list. Eraserhead fills the screen with enough visual sexual puns to give Freud a nightmare in this offbeat David Lynch classic. It is an amazing banquet of tightly controlled images that bombard the senses. From the Man in the Planet's release and fruitless attempt to &quot;pull back&quot; to poor Henry's vain effort to shake off the responsibility that he's inadvertently stepped in, this film takes the viewer down a very different sort of rabbit hole. Alice definitely doesn't live here.     The audience follows Henry into his forced marriage and watches him as he turns on the spit of his actions' consequence. This universal tale of a moment of pleasure and its inevitable outcome can make you squirm!      Particularly potent is the dinner scene with Mary's parents where Henry learns that &quot;there's a baby&quot;. From the moment Henry arrives the audience is bombarded with claustrophobic visual references to birth, responsibility for actions and to ultimately sexual desire turned rancid as Mrs. X in a feverish display attempts to seduce Henry's not-so-attractive personae.     But it is Mr. X who gives us the male perspective with his soliloquy of building a life out of thin air as he describes putting in the pipes (to control everything) and then going numb from it. He fatefully points the way for Henry when he describes massaging his numb arm back from its dead state. And then, in a supreme act of irony, Mr. X  hands Henry the knife, bidding him to do what he can't. But poor Henry's attention is riveted only on the near future as he hallucinates (or does he?) the chickens oozing afterbirth.    In the end, the audience is left with hope, but not until Henry earns his &quot;Horrible Henry&quot; moniker. But it is the hope of irony. Does Henry pay? Or is he doomed and are we all? In heaven, everything is fine-or so we're led to believe.    Greatness in film is in the creator, not the accounting office. Shot on a shoestring, Eraserhead transcends. Once cannot imagine the production to be any more lavish. This is a must-see for any serious film student. Its dark and quirky imagery and it's tightly controlled editing shows that real genius is not a substitute for meagbuck budgets.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Like Braveheart, this movie touches on the idealistic and poetic.  The fights are very real and powerful.  The movie acurately depicts the cruelty of the slave trade in Roman times. I think this movie is Russell Crowe's best performance
6303327982|1.0|This so-called &quot;polemic&quot; director, who already gave us the masterpiece PLATOON, the entertaining &quot;ANY GIVEN SUNDAY&quot;, the intriguing &quot;JFK&quot; and others, reached the lowest part of his career in this lousy picture, one of the worst thing I ever watched. Of course his &quot;good&quot; intentions were clear: criticize the American press love for news of violence, etc, etc. But the way he chose to do that was outrageous: half way through the movie, you cant watch it anymore, so bad it is, so bad taste, so ridiculous. This is no surprise, taking in consideration the fact that &quot;Blood lover&quot; QUentin Tarantino wrote this garbage... Watching this, youll only be adding polution to your brains ..
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Bjork, a musical genius.  All of her albums are excellent.  From &quot;Debut&quot; to &quot;Homogenic&quot;, yet &quot;Selmasongs&quot; tops them all.  When I heard that her new album was coming out, i quickly bought it and immediatley fell in love with it.  I had it for about a month before i saw &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;. After I saw the amazing, breathtaking movie, even though I knew all the songs by heart, I felt as if i had bought an entirely new cd when i listened to after the movie.  The cd meant so much more to me, and made so much more sense.  So, go out and buy this cd and go see &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;!
B000002UAR|5.0|This album is great. I especially like Lennon's compositions- they are the most focused and creative of his career. &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; is soooooo far ahead of its time. It was only in 1996, when the techno outfit the Chemical Brothers released the single &quot;Setting Sun&quot;, that a song like this was duplicated. NOBODY was using sampling and looping techniques back in 1966 except the Beatles. A splendidly psychedelic album.
B00004XONN|4.0|It's not impossible to love this album. It's also not impossible to hate this album. My first reaction after I heard the whole album was...&quot;What is going on here?&quot;.. but after listening to it for god knows how many times, I kinda like it. Not as much as OK Computer but good enough for a 4 star rating. Take a listen to How to Disappear Completely. Thom Yorke whining 'I'm not here.. I'm Not here' will hypnotise U...Optimistic.. one hell of a track.. Idioteque.. the beat will enchant you.. and last but not least.. take a listen to Motion Picture Soundtrack...grand...splendid.. especially when Thom cries out 'I will See you in the next life', really send shivers down my spine. Kind of reminds me of Exit Music... Beautiful...
B000002UAX|5.0|This is a marvelous album. it's the last Beatles album I heard but it is the best. McCartney is at his most understated, with beautiful folk-ish songs left and right. Lennon also chips in with some marvelous songs, esp. &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun,&quot; &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot; and &quot;Dear Prudence.&quot; George's contributions are more scattershot, from the outstanding &quot;Long Long Long&quot; and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; to the throwaway &quot;Savoy Truffle.&quot; and I must add that &quot;Revolution 9&quot; is a marvelous song. Altogether this album is the Beatles tackling pretty much all 20th century music, from heavy metal and avant garde to folk and country. The best Beatles album if you ask me. Now if only those guys at Apple would remix the album into its full stereophonic glory rather than the &quot;processed stereo&quot; in which this masterwork is sloppily rendered.
157492589X|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was released on national tv as a mini series.  It immediately became one of my favorite movies.  The best thing about this movie is how most of the characters become immortalized in death.  We, the viewers, will always remember them and the saga they shared with each other and, more importantly, with we the viewers.  Some people simply don't like the film because it is a western....but I say to you, if you make it past the first hour then you're hooked....and after some more time it doesn't even seem like a western anymore...it just seems like a great flick.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Intresting thing about this movie is that people either love it or hate it. I found it to be one of the best movies I had seen in a while. Now I'm not saying this becuase i'm a guy and i like gory movies. This movie blew me over. It was brilliant in its mastery of reinacting the life of a gladiator and furthermore it had some of the most powerful speeches and thought provoking ideas that I have heard since braveheart. I give this movie 5 stars and I'm sorry that I couldn't give it 6.
B000023VR6|1.0|Dre should have quit after &quot;The Chronic&quot; came out. That album was good, not on a lyrical level but because it was new and different. How long can Dre pretend to be a gangster. &quot;2001&quot; is one of the worst rap albums in recent memory. Dre just can't compete in a scene full of talented young rappers who don't have to pretend to be gansters to sell albums. If you want a good album check out &quot;The 18th Letter&quot; by Rakim or &quot;Heavy Mental&quot; by Killah Priest.
B000021XS0|5.0|As an avid Prog fan, and die-hard DT fan, I have listened to this CD close to 200 times. Without a doubt when the great big book of rock and roll is written, this album should take it's rightful place in the top 5 Rock albms of all time. Right next to The Wall, St. Peppers, Darkside of the Moon, And Operation Mindcrime.Crazy, You say! It's Great, but not that great? A careful listen to this masterpiece of music is all it takes. Along with the most creative and complex musical stylngs and engrossing lyrics, It is a concept album. A form of music that has largely been ignored by most music lovers as well as critics. With the exception of the afore mentioned albums, this type of music and album is difficult to write, compose and record. As a musician of this genere for many years, I can atest to what kind of talent, ambition, and drive, it takes to pull off this type of work. This CD is not a run-of-mill, sounds-like-the-next-guy, sugar-coated, radio-friendly, Record Company-money making, cookie-cutter type of album. This is an album that showcases this bands incredible talent and heart, to go out on a creative limb an deliver the most intelligent, thought-provoking, piece of music since &quot; The Wall &quot;. Make no mistake about it, Dream Theater is unquestionably the best Rock/Hard Rock/Metal/Progressive band the world has heard in 20 years.A DT fan can only hope that the rest of the unsuspecting public new this secret that DT fans have known for more than a decade. If you buy only one Rock/Hard Rock/Prog Metal CD from this day forward, this CD should be in your collection.
B000002J1Y|3.0|An amazing recording, definitely worth resurrecting and spinning on the turntable again - sorry the CD player (Personal Digital Audio player?)!<br />just sit down with your headphones on and a good book, slumped down &quot;in the chair that really fits you&quot; and drift.<br />If popular music can be compared to evolution, with unexpected mutations here and there, providing some musical styles with an advantage over others by fulfilling a need that maybe the artist did not even realize was there, then Yes represents an evolutionary dead-end in Rock history.  Rock-and-roll since 1972 definitely did NOT go the way of Yes' overblown, operatic, occasionally self-concious Art-rock interpretation. Nevertheless, it is beautiful to observe, preserved in time like some Neanderthal skeleton.
0920668364|5.0|My family and I had the opportunity to hear Robert Munsch tell his stories to a room full of kids and thier parents at a storytelling/Family reunion at Saint Vincents College in PA.  The auditorium was full of giggles from Robert's wild use of exageration and full of tears from mom's and dad's that know the love that he writes about.  For those of you who feel &quot;love you forever' story is bizarre, check out his other books...Alligator Baby, Good Familes Dont, or The Dark.  ALL his books are silly and full of over exageration...thats his style. They are meant to make kids LAUGH.  Just so happens that this book makes you laugh AND cry!
B000002H70|5.0|When I first bought this cd at the age of 12, i had no knowledge of The Cure except through friends. When I first listened to this, my life opened up before my eyes, and i realized what good music was. Disintegration is a beautiful landscape of soothing guitars, deep bass,soft keyboards, and an atmosphere of desparing love and misery. If you have ever experienced lost love, or betrayal, your thoughts will be mirrored in Robert Smith's celestial voice. He brings you on a journey through his life. There is not a single bad song on this cd; all of them keep the attention of the listener until the very end. There is no best track, because the best track is the whole cd. If you know the cure, you will already know that this is their best cd. So do yourself and buy this perfect epic masterpiece, and see what I mean when i say that this is my favorite cd of all time. You will not be dissapointed

0783222955|5.0|Gregory Peck stars in this near perfection film adaptation of a magnificent novel. Atticus Finch (Peck) is a district attorney assingned to defend a wrongfully accused black man of the rape &amp; assult of a young white women. All during the main plot Atticus' children Jem &amp; Scout discover the truth of rasicm, &amp; the mysterious nieghbor Boo Radley. <br />The film has to be considered one of the greatest dramas ever made, &amp; what makes the film even more enjoyable is that is family oriented.
0783240236|4.0|I've always felt kind of ambivalent about The Birds.  Yeah, it's Hitchcock, and you get lots of cool Hitchcockian touches (the lack of a musical score makes the film much scarier than it otherwise would have been), but am I the only person who thinks there's way, way too much exposition and character development?  Every time I see it I find myself losing interest in the overdeveloped story until the brilliant restaurant scene, where everything is suddenly funny and entertaining and offbeat.  And that part when Tippi Hedren sllloooowwwwlllyyy walks up the stairs to investigate a suspicious noise and opens the bedroom door to find thousands of little feathered menaces... it's brilliant.  But you have to sit through so much gray, uninteresting, irrelevant character interaction to get to that point that the payoff almost isn't worth it.  Of course it's good to have deep, rounded characters in a movie like this instead of just a bunch of thick-skulled teenagers from Dawson's Creek, but this is overkill.  You could cut more than half an hour of dialogue scenes out of this movie without really hurting it.  But I seem to be in the minority on this one, so if you love this movie go ahead and get it.  You could certainly do a lot worse.
B00004YMVC|5.0|&quot;Everything &amp; Nothing&quot; is Sylvian's &quot;best of&quot; collection of the last 20 years' work.  It goes as far back as a couple of forward-looking tracks recorded with Japan (with newly-recorded vocals), including &quot;Ghosts&quot;;  and encompasses out-takes from &quot;Dead Bees on a Cake,&quot; his most recent album.  It's a significant body of work by one of the most subtle, exploratory, and frankly spiritual singer-songwriters of our era.  Many of the songs -- such as &quot;Orpheus&quot; and &quot;Scent of Magnolia&quot; -- engage issues of integration in the deep psyche in ways that Jungian thinkers like James Hillman and Marie-Louise Von Franz would have admired;  several of the lyrics seem addressed to what Jungians call the &quot;anima mundi,&quot; the Soul of the World -- often embodied in a beautiful woman (or in a fiery spiritual male figure, such as the &quot;Riverman&quot; in another tune.)  Like Eno, Sylvian is a curator of sounds rich and strange, provided for the sessions by his old bandmates in Japan, as well as such illustrious guests as Jon Hassell, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot, David Torn, and others.  One of the best tracks on this collection, &quot;Cover Me with Flowers,&quot; teams Sylvian up with Steve Tibbetts, an ECM recording artist who should be more widely known.<br />I'm not sure this album functions all that well as a &quot;best of,&quot; in the sense of &quot;If you own only ONE David Sylvian album, buy this.&quot;  If you did that, you'd be missing songs that are at least as good or better than anything here, such as &quot;Red Guitar,&quot; &quot;The Ink in the Well,&quot; &quot;Taking the Veil,&quot; plus many of the instrumental compositions that fleshed out his albums &quot;Gone to Earth&quot; and &quot;Words with the Shaman.&quot;<br />The many out-takes -- comprising at least half of this 2-CD set -- raise an interesting question about Sylvian's artistic choices. Many of the out-takes from &quot;Dead Bees on a Cake&quot; are better than the album itself.  Certainly &quot;The Scent of Magnolia&quot; is a more compelling song than &quot;I Surrender,&quot; the rather smug, self-satisfied, and musically inert (that Sade guitar lick and all) single from that album that also appears here.  &quot;Cover Me with Flowers&quot; is also superior to most of the &quot;Dead Bees&quot; tracks.  The very best song recorded for those sessions -- a complex masterpiece called &quot;Les Fleurs du Mal&quot; -- seems to have suffered the fate of being just a B-side on one particular EP &quot;I Surrender&quot; release, and is not rescued from obscurity here.  (It's worth seeking out!)<br />But there's a gravity and a powerful arc to this sequence as Sylvian has sculpted it.  A bonus EP included with the import version only contains two different mixes of &quot;Magnolia,&quot; with a great tune called &quot;The Blinding Light of Heaven,&quot; as well as the title track from Sylvian's best album, &quot;Brilliant Trees,&quot; with a slightly reworked vocal.  Fans of Eno, Fripp and Hassell should check out Sylvian, and &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot; and this collection are fine places to start.<br />I can't say enough about the fragile track &quot;Come Morning,&quot; which was featured on an album by Nicola Alesini, &quot;Marco Polo.&quot;  In a single verse, Sylvian attains the exquisite, compressed, profound insight of the great poets, with the sounds around him as perfectly arrayed as the flowers in a wild garden.  It's hard not to weep from the beauty and wisdom contained in this one tune.ad Bees on a Cake&quot; are better than the album itself.

B00004XOWM|5.0|Limp Bizkit have improved alot from their last album, SIGNIFICANT OTHER, but they still haven't achieved the perfectability of their first album, THREE DOLLAR BILL YALL.  I have been listening to Bizkit since my friend told me about them before they were even on MTV.  We bought the CD the day it came out.  Here is my review: 1) intro: just an intro -/5 2) hot dog: my favorite song on the album right now.  The song is heavy and it is funny how it is a spoof of NIN songs. 5/5 3) my generation: Another great song, but i hope they don't overplay it like Nookie. 5/5 4) full nelson: This one is pretty cool.  It is more of a hardcore song. 3/5 5)my way:  The first time I heard this I thought of rearranged.  It is better, though, because of the heavy parts in the chorus. 4/5 6) rollin(air)-I dont really like this one that much. I dont know why but it seems kinda dumb.  2/5 7)livin it up- This is really cool. Think limp bizkit + the eagles life in the fast lane.  5/5   8)the one- fred has alot more relaxed songs reminescient of rearranged.  this is another, it has a cool heavy part at the end. 3/5 9)getcha groove on- I dont like straight rap so this one sucks. If you like N2gether Now then you will like this. 1/5 10) Take a look around- this is from MI2 and it rocks.  I think it is probably 2nd best song on the album. 5/5 11-13) I can't really remember these, because I kept listening to the beginning. 3/5 14)rollin(urban)-this one is worse than the original.  I do think it is funny because DMX shouts WHAT! after they do the rollin part. 2/5<br />Overall, it may sound like a gave this album a bad review, but trust me it is awesome.  It is some of the best new stuff out there right now.
B00004TWZF|2.0|I absolutely love this movie.  However, I am American and I probably fell in love with it more because of the music than the actual movie (though I do love the movie also).  Luc Besson did an excellent job.  I am glad he changed the music from Eric Serra to Bill Conti for the American version.  It would however, have been nice to see the full length with the Bill Conti music.  I have heard both soundtracks and in my mind, Bill Conti created the only music for this film.  I won't be buying the DVD since it contains the Eric Serra soundtrack but I finally found the American version on VHS (out of print now).
B00004TL21|5.0|If you are a long-time fan or have just heard the deftones you can appreciate their new masterpiece, White Pony.  I can't even tell you which songs are the best because they are all perfect and you have to listen to them all in order to get the most from this album.  If i had to pick, i would say digital bath, passenger, change, and knife are the best.
B000002LCK|4.0|This is one of those albums that anyone should have in their collection if they liked New Wave or discovered it after its heyday.  This was the first &quot;electronic&quot; album I had ever heard, ten years ago at the age of 13.  I was only familiar with what was played on top 40 radio, and knew nothing of this group.  When I heard this album, it ran chills up my spine- they craft masterpieces from supposedly souless, superficial electronica.<br />Of course, Bizarre Love Triangle is the highlight here, but there are other great tracks, like Perfect Kiss, which to me is a superb postmodern composition.  The part where they use the chirping frogs' ribbits against a synthesizer background is absolute genius.  <br />My other favorites are Subculture, Thieves Like Us, and True Faith.  I will forever associate the majority of the material on the first CD with my youth.<br />The only letdown is that you are forced to by this as a double album, and the second CD is really irrelevant (sorry to sound so cold), unless you are a diehard New Order fanatic (nothing wrong with that).
B00004YKUX|5.0|Johnny Cash and producer Rick Rubin have now collaborated on three wonderful albums, each with a distinct focus and feel. I think this is the best of the three. With beautiful understated guitar from Norman Blake, a vocal contribution from Merle Haggard, and a stunning version of Nick Cave's The Mercy Seat, this is a 'can't miss' for Cash fans. Cash really inhabits these songs, and in three cases, Solitary Man, One, and The Mercy Seat, makes them so much his own that with the passing of time we'll probably call them 'Johnny Cash songs.' My favorite album of the year so far.
B000001FLA|5.0|This is the 3rd Yngwie CD I bought, and at first I disliked it because, unlike Rising Force, there were only two instrumentals on it.  But I eventually came to accept the lyrical masterpieces like &quot;Magic Mirror&quot; and &quot;Liar.&quot;  But back to the instrumentals.  They are two of Yngwie's best songs ever.  &quot;Crying&quot; takes you through about 3-4 minutes of passionate acoustic playing, followed by a screaming electric guitar response.  And in his trademark epic, &quot;Trilogy Suite Opus 5,&quot; you hear a wide variety of skills and sounds, including a lightning-fast guitar opening (some parts of the riff are even accompanied note-for-note by the bass), a heavy post-intro, and Yng's usual freestyle shredding.  But as the song fades out, and you think it's over, an acoustic riff takes you by surprise, and then the guitar and bass come back in with another metal mashing session.  By the end of the long piece, you'll want to go back and listen to it again and again!<br />As usual, the singing pieces in the songs are very hair-band oriented.  But the highlight of many of the songs are the amazing guitar solos.  I had a bunch of transcribed Yngwie arpeggio and sweep picking excercises that I'd been practicing, and I was very excited to hear them played (faster than I ever could, obviously) in &quot;Magic Mirror&quot; all in rapid succession.  The cover of this CD pretty much tells it all: the lyrics and feel of the album are very fantasy/medieval inspired, and Yng takes on the world with nothing but his Fender Strat.<br />Buy this CD!
B00000K3D4|5.0|The movie itself is a winner.  The plot is suitable for children, yet David Bowie is suitable for anyone else (-:  It's unique, and it is wonderful.  Everyone should see the movie, just like ET.<br />The DVD is also top notch.  The &quot;making of&quot; segment has much more to it than the one on the VHS.  It also has talent files, and trailers to Labyrinth and the Dark Crystal.  <br />I recommend this as a movie, and specifically as a DVD that uses DVD technology to the fullest.
0553278355|5.0|I read this book under the impression that it would be a stereotypical mental illness book.  Once i read the first chapter i knew that it was different from any other  book that i've read.  The emotions that she goes through.  The way she describes her feelings.  I was enraptured throughout the entire story.  I couldn't believe that someone could go through something like she did.  It was unbelievable.  And the ways she pondered her suicide, i never knew that was possible.  For some reason or another, it appealed to me when she explained the she wanted to draw a warm bath and slit her wrists, watching her red blood flow out of them.  Likes red clouds.  I don't understand why that was so appealing to me.  It was a incredible book and it opens your eyes to the possibilities that a human can go through.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Don't get me wrong limp bizkit is really good, its just that they have tons of talent. How can you say they don't when they have three singles from this cd already released before the cd comes out? I don't know, and I'm not going to try an figure it out. My personal favorite song on this album is hot dog, don't ask me why, its just the first track I heard (besides the singles), and it stuck. I like the remix of rollin, i love it when bands put other versions of singles on the cd, cause it gives you something else to hear of that song, I mean how many times have you heard the regular rollin? Anywayz definately limp is improving lots, but at this rate, I think limp is going to have to wait for three or four records before I give em my five star.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Like sone other Pearl Jam releases there are a few songs which take a few listens, but from the opening rokcer through the accustic ballads Thin air and Of the girl this album is very satisfying! Light Years is one of the best in the PJ catalog and then the experimental Parting ways is moving. The one song which dosen't do it for me id Grievance, although a live version I heard did the tune more justice. If you are looking for 10 the return you will be dissapointed, but if have followed the grouos career and appreciate the risk taking, which most modern bands fear to take, then you will be satisfied with this release.<br />pickledjoe
0783225970|5.0|Scarface was the first DVD I ever purchased.As always,the movie is a masterpiece and the disc is well worth buying. The documentary and deleted scenes are like manna from heaven for Scarface fans.The documentary is insightful and informative and features terrific interviews with Al Pacino,Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone.The highlight of the documentary is,undoubtably,the hilarious overdubbed clips from the TV version of the movie. Most movie deleted scenes on DVDs are usually  a big waste of time.Not Scarface though,the outtakes are awesome. The photos on the Still File were great but, unfortunately,they took forever to load.A lot of people complain about the picture quality of the DVD but I had no probelm with it.It was fun reading the subtitles to see what the characters were saying in the movie,too.Overall though,it's a great movie on a well stocked disc and it is a must buy for Scarface fans. As Tony Montana never said &quot;In this country,you gotta get the DVDs first.Then when you got the DVDs,you get the power.Then when you get the power,then you get the women.&quot;
0790751089|5.0|Hola. Espero que para cuando leas esto ya hayas visto la película. Lo importante de rescatar de ella es que Francesca tiene una vida BUENA pero no satisfactoria. Con Robert puede tener lo que busca, pero aunque se anime a arriesgarse, Francesca sabe que se debe a la familia que ya había conformado...<br />Diana, ¿Dónde está tu anillo? ¿Dónde están tus hijos? ¿De que lado de la luna está el corazón?<br />Pocas veces se presenta una oportunidad así dos veces. A Francesca se le dio y las dos las rechazó (la escena de los autos y el retrovisor). <br />Si dices que no, talvez no haya tiempo para una tercera vez. Si dices que no, que sea porque en realidad estás segura de que eso quieres.<br />Ya no estoy en libertad de decir más, así que pase lo que pase, ojalá al menos hayas disfrutado una película que demuestra que no todo el cine &quot;hollywoodense&quot; es para las masas.<br />Hasta entonces.<br />Artefice di Pioggia.
0679879269|5.0|What a great book.  This book bumps The Golden Compass and the Subtle Knife up a knotch.  It could have been a bomb out, but it wasn't, it made the trilogy so good that Pullman will go down with the greats.  As for comparisons to other fantasy novels, I have just one thing to say;  Harry who?
B00003CXE7|5.0|After experiencing this film for the first time I walked out of the theater with a huge lump in my throat. Such haunting glory, such subdued greatness....it was as if I had been in the Coliseum fighting along side Maximus (Crowe). One cannot begin to explain the pure genius of this motion picture. It brings you to emotianal, physical and pychological climax in less than the first thirty minutes only to bring you back again.   Crowe, Phoinex and Neilsen all act with Oscar worthy preformances. Neilsen with her absolute helplessness, Phoinex with his twisted, evil and ambitious potrayal of the emperor Commodus and Crowe with his heart wrenching character Maximus: Father, General, Gladiator, hero.  Not only are the actors stunningly beautiful, the visuals are likewise. If you have ever wanted to know what Rome would look like before Attila the Hun, before natural disaster, before collapes, this is your chance. &quot;Gladiator&quot; will take you from a quiet villa in ancient Spain to the over-crowded, energy-packed streets of the greatest empire on earth.   With visuals never before attempted and acting that of gods, what is left to stir your senses more? Music. &quot;Gladiator&quot; contains one of the most glorious soundtracks I have ever heard. Hans Zimmer amasses cellos, ancient mandolins and precussion instruments, latin vocalist and his already untouchable talent to create a spine-tingeling score worthy of any award. I especially loved the song played during credits, &quot;Now We Are Free&quot;. It truly gave me goosebumps.   I don't recomend that you buy this, I command it. &quot;Gladiator&quot; is for anyone who loves action, adventure, romance and characters so deep with emotion you cannot help but watch it again. I have seen this movie four times and every time I come out feeling as though I should not speak or else the soft fog of the moment will break. Buy it. You will love it.
0783114893|4.0|Some movies leave a peculiar taste in your memories. In 1986, I saw Robert Harmon's HITCHER two or three times when it was theatrically released and, some fifteen years later, I bought it right after its DVD release. I simply had to have this movie in my library. To be honest, it's not because I want to watch HITCHER twice a month during the next ten years, but rather bacause I want my friends to discover this movie and be as disturbed as I was the first time I saw it.<br />The thriller genre has not produced so many great movies as the other Hollywood genres. Mainly because the producers and the directors are more interested in spending their budgets in explosions and car crashes than in a good screenplay. So, most of today thrillers are technically perfect but so dull and stupid. HITCHER, on the other hand, can easily be read at different levels. And that's the mark of a good movie. Entertaining yes but not only.<br />HITCHER raises a lot of questions and scarcely gives direct answers to them. Why does Rutger Hauer always appear when C. Thomas Howell is tired or is about to sleep ? Is he nothing else than a nightmare ? Why so many ... allusions - verbal or symbolic - concerning the relation Hauer-Howell ? And so on.<br />This HBO DVD presentation is not perfect, the images being only average, but nevertheless should find a place in your library if you like a great thriller with some food for the mind.<br />... .
B000002J1B|5.0|This is an unbelievable album.  I have never heard anything like it or anything that resembles it.  It is a treasure trove of complex sonic sounds majestically and beautifully interwoven together.  There are moments of happiness, anger, sorrow, joy, calm, aggression, power and docility, and that is just in \\"The Gates Of Delirium\\" alone.  Steve Howe's guitar solo is ear shattering on this piece, and the \\"Soon\\" part is some of the most beautiful soaring moments in the history of Yes.  If a person asked for one song to sum up Yes,  \\"The Gates Of Delirium\\" would be the song that was given.  It is hard to describe the `war medley' other than the aforementioned remarks.  One only needs to listen.  <br />     \\"Sound Chaser\\" is as experimental a piece as anything in the Yes catalog.  It is like riding a roller coaster.  I literally feel like I'm sliding up and down, side to side chasing the sound around the room, the title is very appropriate.  Patrick Moraz plays a very pivotal role particularly on this song, the jazz influence he brings adds a unique style to the music and blends surprisingly well with the rest of the styles the band incorporates.  The rhythm section of Squire and White is in about every time signature in this track while the playing is flawless.<br />     \\"To Be Over\\" is simply beautiful, peaceful yet powerful.  This song is very accessible to any lover of music not only of this style or genre.<br />The recording and mixing of this record is different to say the least, (recorded in Squire's garage on a mobile unit).   It is sharp, tacky and ear piercing at times, but if nothing else it adds to the uniqueness of the sound. <br />     This is a landmark recording in the history of music.  It is hard to believe this was recorded in 1974 and it is light years ahead of anything recorded even today, as is much of Yes' material.   Yes must be commended not only for being experimental and pushing the boundary of creativity but at the same time creating a wonderful piece of beautiful music without letting their creativity destroy it.  Which very, very few bands can do.  This is a great example of 70's recording, unadulterated musical freedom on a major record label, which doesn't exist in today's world.
B000006TRV|5.0|Originally, The Wall was (as is my knowledge) intended to be an album, stage production, and a film.  The brainchild of Roger Waters was and is considered to be the most comprehensive and intricate works based on a concept (despite its striking similarity to The Who's &quot;Tommy&quot;).  Ladened with stories of war, longing, and the oppressive English school system, Roger Waters' lyrics paint a colourful picture.  From the kick-off of &quot;In The Flesh?&quot;  The Wall is a classic. Another Brick In The Wall (part 2), Mother, Young Lust, Hey You, Comfortably Numb, and the ever-pleasing crowd favorite Run Like Hell are the most well-known.  But aside from these songs, The Wall has many other gems, that act almost all act as segues to the next.  If you're just getting into Pink Floyd, The Wall is a &quot;deafinite&quot; choice, along with Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, the less-known Animals, and if you like the spacey, more jamming stuff, even Ummagumma.
B00003XACV|5.0|This score is very original, and very moving. I highly reccommend this score. I am honored to have it in my collection. Thomas Newman always does such a wonderful job with his music, and this is proof!
B00004XOWM|5.0|Get this cd. its nothin like the other 2 cd's, but its better then them. i wish i could give it  1,000,000,000,000 stars
B00004THAY|5.0|This album is CLASSIC. Clapton and B.B. kickin' back and Burnin rubber.  Blues this good must be heard. Only one man puts more FEELING into his blues.  That man is Leslie West.  &quot;As Phat As it Gets&quot; is the newest recording by the hottest blues/hard rock act to graduate from the original Woodstock.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Once again the band that mixes hip-hop and rock together called Limp Bizkit has made another incredible album. As good as Signifigant Other was Chocolate Starfish and Hot Dog Flavored Water is Better. This album has some killer tracks on it including Hot Dog, My Generation, Rollin, Gettcha Groove On, and the theme from Mission Impossible 2, Take a Look Around. In this album their is songs featuring Xzibit, DMX, Method Man, Swiss Beats, and Redman. If you like hip-hop or rock I think you should go out and buy this CD now.<br />&quot;It Totally Reeks With Awsomeness&quot;-Edge and Christian, World Wrestling Federation
6305907145|2.0|I felt the art direction gave the whole movie a beautiful haunting, Vermeer look. It indeed had the look of an oil painting with dramatic gothic lighting.  <br />Since it was called &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; and all the publicity lured me in with promises of Jane Austen's &quot;favorite&quot; story come to life.  I guess I was looking for a good story.<br />I could not find the good story. <br />Take away the film effects and costume/lighting and what do you have.  Characters that individually made the description pathetic an understatement, and collectively were over the top.  Not even Jerry Springer could not find so many dysfunctional people in one house.  Opium, slave rape, alcoholism, neglect, hatred, abandonment, rat infestation, etc.  I could just hear the moviemakers  deciding to throw it all in there, afraid people would think the original story is some insipid 18th century romance novel.<br />Which we know it is not. I fear that they may have created a 21st century insipid drama.<br /> I know that many people are critical of Jane Austen's Fanny as being too afraid, fanatically religious, and too goody-good. This Fanny was disappointing since she had no personality at all, and just stood and watched. She constantly looked at us as if to distance herself from the film. <br />Jane Austen is a tough story teller to compete with, but I can't escape getting the sense that the creators of this film are just a tad conceited at there own ability. All at Jane Austin's expense. It is always a controversy as to what plays to a contemporary crowd.  I am not blasting the writers/director's license to express their own creativity. They can write what they want, but I could not say I thought any of this movie culminating in anything worth watching.
B000002KMV|5.0|Most critics and fans tend to overlok the greatness of this album.  Though it continues in the same vein of DIRTY MIND, the fusion of rock and funk is more characteristic here.  Tougher and funkier, in terms of the lyrics and Prince's vocals, many of the moments here are among Prince's best (the title track, &quot;Let's Work&quot;, &quot;Private Joy&quot;, &quot;Jack U Off&quot;).  The rest don't reach as high, but are still great nonetheless.  Also, &quot;Annie Christian&quot;, where Prince speaks demented lyrics like 'I'll live my life in taxicabs', is the man's weirdest hour.
B00000JJQK|5.0|It's pretty tough writing a review for an album where it appears that everything that can be said about this album has been said.  However, if Brian Wilson had that attitude about songwriting before doing &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, then we wouldn't be listening to it, right?  So here's my two cents:<br />If you have the mono mix of this album, it is worth the extra money to upgrade to this CD.  The stereo mix brings out the Boys' voices to their fullest.  It will fill up you car or your home stereo much better than the mono version.<br />Pop (or rock) music can be sophisticated, but still be accessible, attract new generations of music fans and reward repeated listenings, like &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.  If you were to believe the critics of 2000, you would think that &quot;Kid A&quot; by Radiohead just passed &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; in the music department.  Don't believe it.  In another 35 years, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; will still be revered and loved by new generations, while &quot;Kid A&quot; will probably be looked at with disdain, a pompous monstrosity, much like the the works of Emerson, Lake and Palmer are looked at now in '00.<br />Oh yeah, the music on here is great!  Unlike their earlier hits, which are badly overplayed on the homogenized, baby-boomer oldies stations, the songs here never seem to get tiresome.  It's kind of like a hazy summer day at a tropical beach, with dark thunderclouds on the horizon, at least for me.  Any fan of rock or pop music should have this CD in their collection, without question.  Once you have it, the recent Brother Years compilation (1970-86) will make a fascinating bookend for &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.  It does show that &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; dwarfed nearly everything else the Beach Boys did afterward, even though there were some interesting stops along the decline.
B000002UB3|5.0|I have been listening to this album since 1969. It's the best pop album!!!
B00004XQP4|4.0|This CD appears to be dividing people even more than &quot;Nimrod&quot;.  Of course there are the fans who want Green Day to make the same album, 3 chords over and over to retain their punk &quot;cred&quot;.  Then there are fans who don't want to hear the same thing over and over again and will gobble up &quot;Warning&quot;.  The &quot;cool&quot; critics will hear the pop influence and cry &quot;Sellout!&quot; ad diarrheum.  One can easily see that review pattern here even in the Amazon world.  That aside, I find &quot;Warning&quot; is a worthwhile CD.  It's great to see a group grow up and change musical styles and expand their lyrics past masturbation, even if they fall flat on their face once in awhile.  The expansion of styles is evident on many tracks, especially &quot;Warning&quot; (goofy lyrics, though), &quot;Misery&quot; and &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot;.  Despite the increase in acoustical and wind instruments, the songs are no less intense than their earlier efforts.  If you're a fan of Green Day and don't mind them adding some extra chords to their songs, then this CD comes highly recommended.  If you like the single &quot;Minority&quot;, you'll like &quot;Warning&quot;.  For those that can't get out of the &quot;Dookie&quot; chute, you'll know where to find that CD with the brown binding...
B00004XOWM|3.0|I've listened to most of the songs and so far they've seemed to be sub-par from what i expected. Rollin'in my opinion is the best song on the cd, and it isn't even THAT great. I like the song but it isn't nearly as good as other songs he has written. Song #2, Hot Dog is pretty good too because it is entertaining to listen to all the swearin and bad mouthin of other people that he does. Numbers 10 and 11 are also alright to listen to since they actually have some kind of melody and flow to them and it mixes it up from beats such as Rollin'. If i knew all of this information before I bought the cd I would have 2nd thoughts about buying it, but I still would. After listening to it more I'm sure I'll like them better overall. It would be hard to follow up on his last cd Significant Other which was spectacular...so buy the cd, it should be worth it.
B00004XOWM|5.0|I think that this is the best cd limp has ever made. I'm a serious fan and love all of their cds but this one is the best. They have matured a lot in ways, yet their are still the best rock band out there. If you like limp bizkit or rock i seriously suggest this cd. Its a must buy, so go out and get it. You'll love it. Limp Bizkit rocks!
B000001EAQ|4.0|This is easily U2's most underrated record. Having adopted irony as its theme for the 1990s, wrapping themselves in uncharacteric sonics, 'Pop' (1997) is probably one of U2's most personal records.  Here's a song-by-song:<br />1. \\"Discotheque\\".  Although many discouraged fans could not get beyond the kitsch of the video (a big mistake to release in advance of the record?), it has one of the nastiest little guitar riffs ever and is certainly not about the Village People in a dance club.<br />2. \\"Do You Feel Loved\\".  Nowhere is the presence of Flood as producer and Howie B. on the sampling board more evident, in this, a lyrical ode to those lovers/fans who would invade Bono's space.  Somehow it all works.<br />3. \\"Mofo\\".  Bono's one and only ode to his mother, who he lost at age 14, is also the most heavily-influenced by a club music mentality.  Again, a lot of fans just couldn't \\"look for the baby Jesus under the trash.\\"<br />4. \\"If God Would Send His Angels\\".  Similar to \\"Stay\\" from 'Zooropa' (1993), this version remains superior to the unduly cut version that was released as a fifth single.<br />5. \\"Staring at the Sun\\".  An uncharacteristicly acoustic number peppered with an Oasis-like sensibility, this was probably one of the best-received singles from this much-maligned record.<br />6. \\"Last Night on Earth\\".  Lyrically picking up where \\"Discotheque\\" left off, this is one of the few straight-ahead rockers, although it went nowhere on the charts as the third single.<br />7. \\"Gone\\".  A relatively straightforward rock song musically, it is also a lyrical high point and the only song from the record still performed consistently live.<br />8. \\"Miami\\".  If this record deserves to be maligned, perhaps the seemingly purposeless lyrical play of \\"Miami\\" is the reason.<br />9. \\"The Playboy Mansion\\".  There is nothing too memorable here, lyrically or musically, as this tune would have made a better b-side.<br />10. \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\\".  An attempt to recapture themood of \\"Love Is Blindness\\", it is simply not as successful, as far as brooding ballads go.<br />11. \\"Please\\".  Unlike much of this record, \\"Please\\" is beautifully simple, with Edge providing his characteristically understated echoed notes to dramatic effect (a la \\"With or Without You\\").  With multiple interpretations to the lyrics, the cover of the \\"Please\\" single chose a political one.  As it was not even promoted in the U.S., this is simply one of the most underrated U2 songs ever.<br />12. \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\".  As with 'Achtung Baby', the record ends on a distinctly dark note, as Bono is uncharacteristicly cynical in his spiritual ponderings.  Although it is often performed live in an abbreviated and minimalistic form, the samples in the backing track make the studio version utterly haunting.
0783243499|5.0|This is a black comedy done to perfection. Once in awhile a film comes along that exceeds all expectations, and this is that movie. It can be watched several times. This is a movie to watch without distractions, if you walk away for a second, pause the movie. It is entertaining on so many levels. The monologue/dialogue is superb! The storyline takes you back to the materialistic 80's, Regan era and makes you laugh out loud. Christian Bale's performance of Patrick Bateman is flawless. Patrick Bateman is a sadistic, good looking, professional, educated, serial killer, that can hold down a brilliant conversation about his seemingly very caring views on  world affairs. Mary Harron (director) takes you on a journey you will not soon forget. I would not recommend this movie to anyone that needs a plot spoon fed to them. Anyone, else....Own it!
B00004XONN|5.0|for those of you who have been saying that &quot;kid a&quot; isn't what radiohead is all about or that there are no real &quot;songs&quot;, then you shouldn't listen to this in the first place.  who are you to say what radiohead is or isn't?  if you're looking for corporate produced music - listen to n'sync or backstreet boys.  but for those seeking to hear something creative and beautiful then &quot;kid a&quot; is for you.  all true artists are creative and don't always do the same thing over and over again, otherwise they're not truly &quot;artists&quot;.
B00004XOWM|5.0|And I thought &quot;Significant Other&quot; was the best rock album I've ever heard.  This album is a lot better.  I was shocked at how much they'd improved.  Anyone who doesn't like Limp Bizkit either doesn't like rock or is...  Every track rocks.  &quot;My Generation&quot; is he hardest track on the album and might be their best song to date.  It has awsome DJ and drum solos and a crushing guitar line.  &quot;Rollin'&quot; is the second best track.  It's second version, whis one with DMX at the end of the album, I thought would be another cheap sounding remix, like KoRn's &quot;Make Me Bad&quot; remix or just about any other remix that just about ruins the song.  Again, I was wrong.  This 7-minute track is almost as good as the other version.  Any rock fan will enjoy this album, whether he admits it or not.
6301562143|5.0|BATMAN is my favourite movie since I was a child, and Michael Keaton becomes my favourite actor since BATMAN come out.

6305313687|5.0|American History X: rated R, 1 hour and 58 minutes    American History X is a well-thought out thriller in which Edward Norton stars as an extraordinarily astute neo-nazi who becomes repentant for choosing the path of becoming a racist skinhead. The characters in the movie are exceptionally developed with skillful actors to match their complexity. Edward Furlong plays Norton's confused teenage brother. Furlong's acting is sensational, but Norton in particular displays talent literally beyond human conception. He delves so deep into the character of Derek Vinyard that he easily wins over the audience in thoroughly convincing them of his animosity. At one moment in the movie, Derek marches back triumphantly after brutally slaying a black man. In this flash, Edward Norton presents a facial expression like no other. His eyes are filled with deathly delight, his mouth twisted in a grin of sheer pleasure, and his cheeks glowing with the image of death. At this instant, as well as throughout the whole movie, Edward Norton puts in his greatest effort and captures and provokes the audience utilizing his incredibly skilled acting ability. I firmly believe that he is worthy of holding the best-actor title at this year's Academy Awards.  The plot of American History X starts off with Daniel Vinyard being assigned an enormous report containing all of the details on how his brother had become active in the nazi community, how that impacted his life, and all of the events leading up to the present day. Initially he is overwhelmed and does not take it seriously, but his brother, who just returns home to his family after being incarcerated for the murder of three men, forcefully urges Danny to complete the thesis. Danny titles the report American History X and proceeds to type it up with minimal success. As time passes by, Danny begins to undergo painful flashbacks involving his brother and his own childhood. He submerges into his past and progresses greatly with his life story. Itbecomes obvious that Derek is the main influence on him. Derek introduces Daniel to the life of hatred and crime. After their father dies trying to put out a fire, being shot by a colored man, the two boys' lives change dramatically. This is the supposed origin of Derek's loathsome ways. Later on, it is known that the source of Derek's anger goes much deeper beyond his father's death. Now out of prison, Derek seems to be strangely reformed. Jail has traumatized him and taught him a valuable lesson that he could not have possibly learned without his outstanding perception and intellect. The rest of the movie deals with Derek attempting to restore his own life and correct his younger brother's before it is too late.  Chilling and forceful, American History X is aimed directly at the hearts of sensitive Americans like myself. American History X is truly more frightening than any typical horror movie; it portrays the harshness and injustice of reality in an extremely effective manner. It is in my opinion, the most powerful and emotional movie of the decade. The movie is created as a wake up call to America. The violence, racial prejudice, and malevolence that take place concealed amongst the citizens of the US are expressed to a maximum velocity in the movie. As well as acting as a warning, the movie offers great insight into questions that many of us have forever yearned for the answers to. It accurately exposes the means by which a seemingly average and intelligent human being can be metamorphosed into a vicious and cruel hate monger.   American History X is an incredible entertaining and educational experience. The movie brought tears to my eyes during certain sequences and fury during others. It hit me head on with all of its intensity and I came out of the film perplexed and abysmal, yet in no way do I regret seeing it. I strongly would recommend that anyone with the tolerance for excessive violence and graphic depictions view this movie.<br />Profound and mesmerizing, American History X, also starring Elliot Gould, Beverly D'Angelo, and Stacy Keach, directed by Tony Kaye, is in my eyes one of the most rich and enlightening movies of its time. I give it a flawless A+.
0399146369|3.0|I eagerly anticipate Cornwell's novels and usually am more than overly excited to share with my friends the newest Kay Scarpetta novel, but The Last Precinct for me was a disappointment. The writing itself is up to Cornwell's usually 5 star work for me, but the story line, just left me wanting more of what wasn't there. Kay is a strong character, but she was so wishy-washy to me in this book. Trying to see her as vulnerable at times just came out as bland to me. Black Notice had a little bit of everything and I guess I just kept thinking of it considering the characters are carrying over.
0064407667|5.0|This Series is nothing short of brilliant.  However, not for every child.  Clever kids, smart children, quiet 'outsider' types and those who like to defie thier parents should definitely read this one.  It's one of the few books that is better for boys than for gilrs!  Average kids and simple adults just won't get it.<br />   What we have here is Gothic for children (I refer to &quot;Gothic revival&quot; as outlined by Richard Davenport-Hines in his book &quot;Gothic- -Four hundred years of excess, horror, evil, and ruin&quot;) The literary merit of these books is beyond question.  There are hundreds of linguistic jokes (&quot;to snick&quot; means to wound; Mr Poe works for &quot;Mulcturary Money Management&quot; --- go head, look up 'mulct')  The author includes himself as a charater.  In each book we find out a little more about what happened to him and his Beatrice (&quot;Dearest, darling, dead.&quot;) <br />As for the concern about the 'incest' mentioned in the review below, I understand this to be a lack of knowlage concerning classic lit. - the evil uncle coniving to marry his pretty niece is stock story line from Plautus, the Mid-evil stage, all the way to Molaire and 19th C. melodrama.<br />Finally, the books are handsome to hold a wonderfully illustrated- -making them fun to own.<br />Make no mistake; horrible, awful and very sad things happen to the Baudelaire children but that is all the more reason they are perfect heroes for the 10-14 year old set.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|Other reviewers have said it all below -- this is Dire Straits' finest album.  Telegraph Road is a fifteen-minute cinematic masterpiece - on every level: the melody, the arrangement, the atmospherics, the distinct and perfect contributions of each band member, and above all the way it builds.  A long lonely whistle... a story of 'progress'...a story of love struggling against a backdrop of economic depression... and the rousing ending that comes on like ten, twenty, a hundred galloping horses.  I hadn't listened to it in a couple years, just put it on last week... it's amazing when the artistic beauty of a rock song can move the listener to near tears.
B00004XONN|5.0|I'm not going to berate the people that gave this CD a bad review, even if they have listened to it several times before placing judgement, because the album simply isn't for them.  Look back to what you first thought of OK Computer, you probably thought it was a little overboard (even the critics weren't overly wowed by OKC at first).  It takes time to really appreciate what Radiohead is trying to do. I was somewhat disappointed in Kid A at first, but after a couple of listens, I found that most of the songs were stuck in my head while I was at work, and I couldn't wait to get home and put the CD in.  What at first sounds like just a series of experimental sound clips takes on a beautiful musical quality after several listens.  Radiohead continues to put out music that stretches the imagination, and challeges their fans.  All the reviewers that mention &quot;Creep&quot; in their reviews make me laugh.  You listen to Pablo Honey now, and it's tough to believe that's even Radiohead. But to try and even compare this to their &quot;Creep&quot; days makes no sense other than to show the progression of their work. Listen to the end of &quot;Blow Out&quot; on Pablo Honey and you get a 7 year preview of Kid A. <br />&quot;The National Anthem&quot; might just be the greatest driving song ever recorded.  The firs time I listened to that song in my car, I found that I was driving about 90 mph during the closing section, between the driving bass and the manic horns, you just get lost in the music.  &quot;How to DIsappear Completely&quot; is a beautiful, emotional song.  &quot;Optimistic&quot; would have been at home on OKC, and is fabulous.  &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; is a great closing track, leaving the listener in a dreamy state of mind. Great CD, but it's not for the close minded.
B0000025CP|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am not a metal fan at all. Let me then go on that for at least 15 years I have had one version or another of this album. Long after I got tired of Iron Maiden, Motorhead and the like, only this gem and the early AC/DC remains. This album is the most original piece of Hard Rock I have ever heard. The sound is like that of no other record in the genre I know of. Instead of sounding like the factory floor, the inner city, industrial wasteland or a medieval battlefield, this record sounds like the soundtrack for a science fiction movie. The extremely polished guitars give a dramatic air of stillness emanating from the wall of sound. The other factor making this one of the great albums of Rock is the complete   originality. Because nobody seems to have followed the direction they were indicating, every turn of the guitars, and the melodies still sound as if they were invented yesterday. There are very few pieces of music where you can say that after 22 years. Purely because of its musical qualites this one willnot be soon forgotten.
0679746048|3.0|First of all, it's not like the movie.  Is it better or worse, I'm not sure.  I don't like how the movie took such creative liberty with the story and it's characters but I also don't like the way the book jumps around so often.  Though some might say the chaotic way the memories are written reflect the author and main character's own unconventional thinking.<br />The book shows us how people with \\"mental problems\\" were all lumped together and for the most part not treated but locked up and subdued.  Were these people totally emotionally fit?  Well, no, but being locked away was not everyone's answer.  <br />I'd like to see a book of the same subject matter about the 1990's and how treatment almost seems the opposite.  Doctors seem happier to keep upping the Prozac dosage rather than lock them up for awhile.  It is interesting to see how people's conceptions can change.
B00004XOWN|4.0|&quot;Rollin'&quot; is the best song with Redman, Methodamn, DMX and &quot;My Generation&quot; is pretty cool. Though cover is misleading this is theri best album yet.
0316777722|5.0|I read David Sedaris' book NAKED this past summer.  Now, I have to read it for a class I am taking at UMass-Amherst.  So, to get a discussion going on the writer, I decided to pick up his newest book.  All I can say is that this book was hilarious.  My favorite story was &quot;Go Carolina.&quot;  It was about David and his speech impediment.  I could relate to this story because I had a speech problem when I was young.  The first half of the book deals with David living in the US, and then goes into his life in France with his boyfriend Hugh.  All of his stories are entertaining.  The most memorable people in the book were David's father and his sister Amy.  I hope David Sedaris continues writing witty and memorable stories like in ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY and NAKED.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty was a truly unusual film which demonstrated that gay couples can be the best-adjusted, most mellow people.  The other characters showed family values of family friction and family violence which heteros cutely call &quot;domestic&quot; violence to avoid associating their sacred &quot;family&quot; with violence.        Heteros should concentrate or being nice to other heteros and being tolerate of those not born hetero.  FAMILY VIOLENCE is not a boon.
B00004U8JU|2.0|DTS? Not really. Normally, DTS shows great care in encoding and overall has amazing sound quality. The sound quality on this DVD is preposterously bad - it does not deserve to carry the label DTS. It sounds like a poorly-done Dolby 5.1 soundtrack! It has no umph, the surround is used to sparringly and obviously, and the dialogue is obviously dubbed.<br />An otherwise great DVD is ruined by awful sound. Buy the regular collector's edition: I'm sure the sound is about the same.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious!  The way that the Wayans Brothers actually took all the famous horror movies and collaborated them into one gigantic SPOOF is awestriking!  I saw this and was rolling on the floor laughing!  A word of advice for any teenager, DON'T SEE IT WITH YOUR PARENTS!  This movie is terribly funny, and gave me stomach cramps for days from the histerics.  This movie puts the Farrely Brothers (There's Something About Mary) to shame.
B00003CWL6|1.0|Okay, so its not that bad, but if you expect a genuine classic in the vein of Schindler's List or Shawshank Redemption, then you'll be disappointed.  The film includes some important adolescent issues, but then so does 'She's All That', and every other high school drama.  It certainly glamorises drugs, as the characters never receive any ill effects in the film's duration.  Even 'Trainspotting' managed to address the dangers of drugs.  Worst of all is the ending - a tacked on who-dunnit that doesn't blend into the rest of the story.  If American Beauty had not won Best Picture, I wouldn't be quite so critical about it, but the Academy really should have gone with The Insider or Being John Malkovich.
B00004W3MS|5.0|I had never heard of this Reykjavk based band until last night, when I saw them in concert, so I was completely unprepared for the experience.  I left feeling as if Id attended a strange ritual combining classical music, avant-garde rock, and a mass.  Sigur Rs manages to bring the ethreal feel of a Philip Glass opera together with the ambiant tone of Radiohead, the serene, tortured vocals of a gregorian chant performed by Smashing Pumpins, with occational ephiphanic peaks of driving drums and impelling base echoing the rage of Tool; and yet the totality is their own.  The concert was more like a trance, I wanted the audience to stop clapping between songs so I could simply float between waves of sound and silence in this extraordinary realm the band managed to create - they performed like classical musicians rather than rock-stars, not speaking, not posing, merely playing their ethreal mucis and leaving the audience in some transubstatiatory state.  Brilliant.
B00003CX7L|4.0|Not as original as the first Toy Story, but it is a very cute, well made movie. My kids loved it!
158234082X|2.0|Here is a great way to save some time and money - read this sentence: Restaurant kitchen staff drink alot and use alot of drugs, they also use alot of vulgar language.  There you have it! The whole book!  Kind of Hunter Thompson meets Julia Child.  Quite repetitious and superficial.  A bit of a disappointment.
0783240503|5.0|As a young child living in London in the early 70s I was one of many lucky kids that found themselves amazed by the live performance of this fantastic musical called JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT. It was so incredible that now, more than 25 years later I can still remember the lyrics to all the songs. Today, I rented a copy on VHS and for more than an hour I happily sang along with the cast. To my complete joy I found myself as amazed as I was as a kid. Donny Osmond is a perfect charismatic Joseph. Maria Friedman is great as the narrator. The songs are fabulous and the story is obviously timeless. All actors are wonderful and you can tell they were all having fun. I knew I would like this new version of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT, but I had no idea I would fall in love again. I am so impressed with the whole production of this new version that I will be buying the DVD soon. I recommend it without reservation to family members from 5 to 90!
B000002G23|5.0|I love this album more than anything!  I checked out this album at the library because I couldn't afford to buy it yet.  There's a beautiful picture of Sting on the wall that's in the Marysville library.  It says, &quot;Sting for American Libraries&quot;.  We just  bought a new stereo system with a CD player.  It sounded like I  died and went to heaven!  I love to just put all four CD's in  and listen to them all day when my daughter's at school.  I can turn the sound all the up and it won't bother anyone! I will  never never never get tired of listening to this album.  I could listen to it for the rest of every minute of my life and I would never never get tired of it.  I really want to buy it when I can afford it!
B00003CXHJ|1.0|I REALLY didn't like this movie! It was about 30 minutes too long for what it had to offer. And besides it's special effects and talented cast that isn't much. I not only dislike it for the fact that it is boring, but it is not historically accurate which has hurt some other recent films like The Patriot and Perfect Storm. For better submarine films, check out The Hunt for Red October or Crimson Tide. For U-571, wait for cable or just skip it altogher. Not worth the time.
B00004R99U|5.0|Meeko, Flit and Percy, these the are names of the original animal friends who get in and out of mischief, befriend each other and accompany Pocahontas in the vast Winter panorama of colonized North America to the hustle and bustle of 17th Century London. That is the setting for \\"POCAHONTAS II.\\"<br />This is an excellent sequel. I never thought I would be saying that about a direct-to-video movie. I was wrong and \\"POCAHONTAS II\\" is a strong testament to that.<br />The film is very faithful to the original characters all around. With the introduction of John Rolfe the story follows the historic Pocahontas as she crosses the Atlantic as the Indian Princess and emissary of her people to London to be received at court and be lionized by English society.<br />Eventually she confronts Governor Ratcliffe and the real drama begins. Ratcliffe is much more a villain in this film than he was in the original \\"POCAHONTAS.\\" To give any more details would be inappropriate. There are many surprises along the way, but Meeko, Flit and Percy are featured throughout so it makes this excellent family fare. There are also at least five knew songs that I was able to count. They were very good and fit each scene perfectly.<br />I was really impressed by the artwork on this feature. This time we get to see the North American virgin land of towering forests covered with Winter's snow, frozen waterfalls and white covered cliffs drawn again with a freedom and energy that posses real power and reverence for the land. In contrast we get to see London congested with buildings and people, horses and carriages crowded in cobble stone streets. Most important to any film, it has a good story, which combines the settings and narrative perfectly.<br />The DVD widescreen picture quality and stereo sound is excellent. I highly recommend this feature. It went far beyond my expectations.
B000006OBQ|4.0|This is Frank on his home turf; he rules it and you can hear it throughout the album.  While I love the way he kicks with Basie, I miss the string section on some of the tunes.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is a great album! Fred Durst and Limp Bizkit have done it again. This is one of those albums where you can listen to every song and not have to skip a track. The album has the MI2 theme and a remix of Rollin' that features Redman, Method Man and DMX. This is an album for all music fans. If you don't already own then go pick it up!
B00000253N|5.0|A classic piece from the 70s, a timeless piece for the kids.
0385491026|5.0|Generally, I like to be analytical and logical when writing about literature. This is what we are taught at university, after all. This novel, however, left me so astounded that I couldn't even talk about it to friends. I finished it more than six months ago and, in a way, have been grappling with it ever since. Scenes from it seem to randomly invade my mind. Surely if a mere work of fiction can hold this power for such a length of time, it must be worth more than the sum of its parts.<br />The only point I really wish to make about it, is that there should be no gender discrimination in recommending this novel. Why anybody should feel that it is meant for a female audience is beyond me. Within the extremely rich layers of its narrative, the novel reveals essential truths about the way in which the process of growing up affects everybody. The fact that the main characters are women is simply not relevant beyond the fact that the narrator herself is a woman. Margaret Atwood is far too great a writer to have confined to such banalities.<br />&quot;Haunting&quot; is possibly the best way to describe this work and I am sure that every perceptive reader will be haunted by the way in which Elaine's experiences are eventually reflected in her art. It is, quite simply, one of the greatest novels I have ever read. But then again, every Atwood novel I read (and I have read them all) just confirms my opinion that she is one of the greatest writers of all time.
B00004YC2F|5.0|I have NEVER heard a Rachmaninoff third concerto recording so inspiring and driving and passionate. Volodos, Levine, and the BPO really do pour their sweat and tears into this monumental work. Volodos' playing is beyond what I expected, and he phrases and shapes everything in this piece. It is a fresh outlook on such a frequently recorded warhorse. I'd give this recording 10 stars if I could...it's definitely a must buy! The transcription of the 2nd movement of the Cello Sonata is also absolutely breathtaking, and so are the performances of the other solo Rachmaninoff pieces. If you buy this cd, you definitely will not be disappointed.
B000006IUQ|5.0|&quot;The Edge&quot; will keep you you on the edge of your seat, no pun intended. Unlike most action thrillers &quot;The Edge&quot; is tense, well acted, and clever. As always Anthony Hopkins is superb but the big suprise is Alec Baldwin who was very good in this movie. The scene where they fight the bear will have you gasping fo breath. It is too bad that this movie wasn't a huge hit in theaters, it should have been. If you get a chance rent &quot;The Edge&quot;, you will not be dissapointed!
B000002UAX|5.0|The most imaginative, curious, strange, magical and fantastic album ever made. This album is positively bursting with originality and consequently it has gone on to become a legend whose name has became the yardstick by which other great albums are measured. There never will be another album quite like, simply because the circumstances of the time were unique; the Beatles had proved all there was to prove, so the pressure was now off. At the same time they were in the process of disintegration.<br />    From the opening sounds of a jet airplane coming in to land, to the final strains of the lullaby Good Night, from the tragic Julia to the maniacal Helter Skelter, this double album is unforgettable. A bona fide masterpiece that has withstood the ravages of time like no other...... Listen to it
B00004XQP4|2.0|Green Day used to be my favorite band, but when Nimrod came out, I could see them starting to go down hill. Green Day is running out of orginality. All of their new stuff on Warning sounds like softer versions of their old stuff, and they have ripped the beetles off many times in this cd. I know that they are not changing their sound just to be popular,(like blink 182), but they could've done a lot better on this album. There isn't one punk song on it, and everything sounds the same. This is definatly Green Days worst work. I wouldn't waste your money on it. Instead buy some NOFX. They are one band that will never sellout.
B00000JPHD|3.0|I'm not sure why this movie is considered such a classic when it seems silly at best, Bela Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula is almost comical.  Then again I was born 49 years after this movie was released.  I was expecting something much more sinister and scary.  The actor who played Renfield was the most enjoyable character in the film, he did a fine job as a psychopath.  I'm just guessing that for every scene with Dracula in it some short person stood directly in front of him shining two small flashlights under his eyes.  I couldn't help but laugh when the opossum appeared (my only theory is that it was supposed to represent a giant rat) but I was almost crying when the armadillos were shown!  The image of Dracula that Lugosi has made the stereotype of vampirism is probably the only endearing quality in this film.  The Max Schreck portrayal of Dracula in the 1922 Nosferatu was much more engrossing and frightening, and that was without sound!  This is a must see for Horror fans if not just to make your own judgement call.  The dialogue and the Wallachian accent of Lugosi make this enjoyable, but scary?  Not by a longshot.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This is proably one of hte best green day albums yet.  They refrain from bad languatge pretty much.  They have catchy melodies and their lyrics all have some meaning to them
6304240554|5.0|The Living Dead are back and this time they're going shopping, for live human flesh!  Four survivors of the mass hysteria that ensues from the original Night of the Living Dead hole up in a Mall, feeling safe and secure (with everything they could possibly need there for the taking).  Of course those pesky zombies are attracted to the living (their sustenance) and the four must contend with the slow moving hordes of the undead.  George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is arguably as good, if not better than Night of the Living Dead, depending on who you ask.  Much more graphic, and this time in living color, the zombies are even more relentless and vicious.  But in this post apocalyptic nightmare it's not just the zombies that are the threat, but bands of anarchistic survivors as well.  It's every man for himself as our quartet battle to save their new home from the dead and the living.  A great social satire on the materialistic American ideal that in any given catastrophe could literally become a deathtrap.  Violent, funny, and excruciatingly frightening, Dawn of the Dead is a must have for any Horror fan's collection.  Followed by Day of the Dead and a 1990 remake of Night of the Living Dead (directed by special effects wizard Tom Savini, who was responsible for the zombie effects).  &quot;When there's no more room in Hell the Dead will walk the Earth.&quot;
B00003CXFG|5.0|I've heard people gripe that this movie is a rip off on Alien but I can't see how--there are no guns, no alien-hybrids, no talking robots.  And that just makes the plot that much stronger because the characters are more plausable, their situation easier to understand.  And of course there's Riddick and Frye, two dynamic characters that are a joy to watch!  Frye appeals because she isn't perfect; you are drawn into her struggle. And Riddick is fabulous--it's so refreshing to have somebody to cheer for.  And personally I was pleased to get away from the over-used Hollywood superstars and the folks from all those teen-flicks. I'm definitely going to be on the lookout for more from Radha Mitchell!  There's so little you know about Riddick, and just like Frye he keeps changing, adapting, growing throughout the movie.  I admit that Frye's death at the end is not the best move but the fact remains that by this point you're so attached to Riddick you're at least releived to see him get out okay.  And don't get me started on Vin Diesel--he puts in a show stopping performance, no matter how mysterious his charcater's background may be he's funny, scary, and complex all at the same time. And he's got a really cute smile to go with it.  I would recommend this movie to anyone--it's entertaining, refreshing, and of course Vin Diesel is gorgeous so you can't go wrong!
0679879269|5.0|I haven't actually finished the book yet but I'm about half way through and it is FANTASTIC!! It almost seems like Pullman's writing style has improved since The Golden Compass. Every scene is full of detail, and he creates worlds that are so real! I would recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy or science fiction. Only one thing--if you're not the kind of person who is willing to accept a fictional religion that contradicts many aspects of the religions of Earth :) , you might not like that aspect of the book...eh whatever, I think you'll still love it. :) Just be careful. You have to be willing to imagine.
B000002JOH|5.0|All I can say about this album is &quot;Wow!&quot;.  It is a magnificent achievement, very heavy, very intricate, and occasionally melodic, in short, everything a metal album should be.  Okay, so it's a distant second to &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot;, but this album is a work of art in its own right.  Standouts would have to be &quot;Walk&quot;, &quot;F. Hostile&quot;, and the two &quot;ballads&quot;, &quot;This Love&quot; and &quot;Hollow&quot;, the latter being the better of the two, and the best song on the album.  I'd also say it's Pantera's second best song, right behind &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot;.  It's mainly better than &quot;This Love&quot; because the melody and heaviness blend together better, and the chorus in &quot;This Love&quot; didn't seem very well thought out.  But, they're both great songs, anyone who thinks Phil can't sing should hear them.  He almost sounds like Layne Staley at certain points.  Anyway, if you want an album that's good and heavy, has a bit of slow stuff, and has music that doesn't sound like something any idiot could play, this is the album for you.  And, if you like this album, check out &quot;Burn My Eyes&quot; by Machine Head.  All hail Pantera, one of the heaviest, most awesome bands alive!
0679745203|5.0|When a young nurse and a maimed thief from Canada, a bomb sapper from India and a half dead man from the Libyan desert --probably a Hungarian-- gathered in a villa in Tuscany, Italy, it was not due to a joke of geography. It was mostly the cruelty of a war of nations, whose heads of state wanted to change the border lines among nations. That was the beginning of the memories by a man who mapped the desert and learnt to hate nations. Although desert-wise he had put the heart into the wrong place. Eventually he lost his identity and was told us as &quot;The English Patient&quot; by Michael Ondaatje's namesake novel (1992). If not the geography let's respect at least the men who made and loved it!  (Excerpt of &quot;In Situ - A society of explorers&quot; as published by me on Oct.16, 2000 at [...]
B0000029AL|4.0|Ah, Aerosmith, how do you describe them? Hard, driving rock with plenty of mainstream accessibility (but not to the point of absurdity). This is where it all began, way back before they started doing pop rock. They were delivering some of the heaviest music of the time. Every song on here is great, but the standout track would have to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite Aerosmith songs of all time, &quot;Dream On&quot;. This song came on the radio when I was driving in my car yesterday, and I just had to crank it (even though it's really not that heavy). However, although the whole album is good, there's really nothing else on here that's all that memorable. &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; is a much more solid album. If you want to hear some great music, this is inarguably a wise choice. Not quite the best album of '73 (It can't compare to &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;), but it's still a heavy metal landmark.
0780631684|5.0|I give it five stars because i thought it was an original thriller, a change from the slasher type overdone horror  films. The movie had a great storyline in that it tests  the characters mortality, and may even make you think  about you own, a scary movie for most of the family, due to that it has no nudity or much harsh language &quot;a bit violent    in some parts of corse&quot; a must see.
0380730367|5.0|Oh my god.  I've read all of Dennis Lehane's books.  Now what?  Sure I can read Faye Kellerman and Jonathan Kellerman and Martha Grimes and P.D. James and on and on and on.  But, there is no one like Dennis.  Now Dennis, I don't want to put any pressure on you, but you need to start writing right away.  I don't know how long I can remain patient.  So stop reading and start writing.   Julie
B00003CWL6|2.0|It's a tragedy that this film won Best Picture (just as it was a tragedy that Shakespeare In Love one the year before, and even worse, Titanic the year before).  It's also a tragedy that this film was incredibly overrated by its viewers.  What does it say?  That so many people can &quot;relate&quot; to the desperate and pathetic characters of this suburbian hell-reality?<br />I thought some of the themes in this film were worthy of presentation.  How ridiculous society (not just middle-America) has become with its over-indulgence of material goods, loss of immaterial and spiritual wealth and wholeness, lack of closeness within the family unit, complete voidness of morals of values...it certainly is a shame!  But the danger of the message in the film is its existential ending, its answer being utter hopelessness and helplessness.  Please.  There are solutions to all of these problems, but unfortunately, neither the makers of the film nor the fans realize this even though they continually ask us to &quot;look closer.&quot;<br />There is some unrealism that should be pointed out in the characters.  I didn't buy the whole &quot;closeted-homophobic military man&quot; character.  I'm not denying that such contradictions in human character exist, however, the film portrayed the character as someone who was mainly concerned with his son, not personal egocentric struggles.  I interpreted Cooper's character's final actions to be purely empathetic and wrathful.  When he kissed Lester Burnham, it was to empathize with his son whom he thought was engaging in homosexual activities with Spacey's character.  When he killed Burnham, it wasn't out of rejection of his homosexual pass, but out of anger for the prostitution of his son.<br />Certainly, the movie deserves some praise for its content, although it is not as original as people claim.  If I am not mistaken, &quot;Ice Storm&quot; incoporated similar themes, and in some ways, was a more successful film in representing society's moral grayness.  I thoroughly enjoyed Kevin Spacey's sarcastic, hedonistic character, (though I do not think it was Spacey's best performance as some have stated.  The deception he created in The Usual Suspects and mystery he upheld in Seven were, in my opinion, more oustanding, substantial, and challenging than his role in American Beauty will ever be) and did empathize with him in the end.<br />It is not surprising that this was a directional debut, as the director overwhelms the audience with its directed narration, leaving no intuitive challenge for the deeper viewer.  I personally desire movies that carry more subtle themes, challenging the audience to understand the meaning of the piece.  With American Beauty, the messages are so naked and apparent that it only encourages brainlessness viewing.<br />Overall, an average movie challenging deep themes.  It deserves this heavy criticism in order to counterattack all the false acclaims it has been given.ty's moral grayness.  I thoroughly enjoyed Kevin Spacey's sarcastic, hedonistic character, (though I do not think it was Spacey's best performance as some have stated.  The deception he created in The Usual Suspects and mystery he upheld in Seven were, in my opinion, more oustanding, substantial, and challenging than his role in American Beauty will ever be) and did empathize with him in the end.  <br />It is not surprising that this was a directional debut, as the director overwhelms the audience with its directed narration, leaving no intuitive challenge for the deeper viewer.  I personally desire movies that carry more subtle themes, challenging the audience to understand the meaning of the piece.  With American Beauty, the messages are so naked and apparent that it only encourages brainlessness viewing.  <br />Overall, an average movie challenging deep themes.  It deserves this heavy criticism in order to counterattack all the false acclaims it has been given.
B000007177|4.0|I like the second disc much more than the first one (the &quot;The Chateau D'Isaster Tapes&quot;).  The second disc offers a good sample platter of many of the musical and vocal styles that Ian Anderson created over the years.  The first disc is for hardcore Tull fans, I believe (I like it, just not as much...).  The second disc had more broader appeal.
0792156684|1.0|The story of the Titanic was a mysterious and tragic classic...until Cameron decided to ruin all of its history and beauty with a poorly written, immature, and not to mention-FICTIONAL love story poorly acted by two rather annoying actors.  And I used to call Cameron (The King of the World) one of my favorite directors!  Director of Aliens (the second of the series, and arguably, the best out of the series), the classic epic-The Abyss (absolutely beautiful, and excellently written and played), and both Terminator and Terminator 2 -- I expected much more depth, magic, and REALISM from Titanic.  All it turned out to be was a shallow and cheezy romance that Cameron held above all the characters that were NONfictional.  How does that do history justice?  If you're going to make a movie based on a true story, you should NOT throw in a fictional romance and ignore all of the real stories that should have been respectfully represented.<br />A disgrace!  And a waste of a whole lot of money!
B00003CWN3|3.0|It is difficult to give this film an accurate rating since there is such a disparity between the way the story is presented on screen and the individual performances within the  film.  The story itself is only an average re-telling of real events and it seems rather disjointed when taken at face value.  The viewer is supposed to feel Brandon Teena's confusion and emotional highs and lows, but the writing only partly succeeds in that endeavor with the best writing coming toward the end of the picture.  Although the technical aspects of the film were average at best, the individual performances more than make up for any weaknesses.  Hilary Swank's performance as Brandon was absolutely stunning.  Her Academy Award win was very well deserved and it is difficult, if not impossible, to find a better performance in American film.  The fact that the Academy chose not to award Chloe Sevigny's performance in this film is something of a travesty given the incredible talent she possesses and the wonderful chemistry she and Swank have on film. Even with a supporting cast of relatively unknown actors, the performances were not hindered in any way.  The fact that the actors were so good in this film should go a long way toward proving that a name is truly secondary to talent.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|So VH 1 (debut) is about establishing a major new guitar talent. The songs (not all) contained within that album are mainly vehicles for Edward to flex his &quot;lead&quot; guitar virtuosity: lots of flash. Although, the pop - sensiblity is definitely in bloom, there. ~~~ Gradually ... Edward's incorporation of &quot;chords&quot; became more dominate to the overall picture, thereby serving the _song_ in lieu of overall guitar wankery.  Fair Warning is the apex of song arrangement for the band. It's certainly the most complex album (musically) they have recorded - IMO.  It's their most understood album - IMO.  To my knowledge, it's their least-selling album.  Many people don't &quot;get&quot; it.  It's their loss. I deem it to be Van Halen's &quot;coolest&quot; (BEST) album in their catalog.  If you disagree, that's okay!
B00004XOWM|4.0|If you enjoyed &quot;Significant Other&quot; in '99, you'll be plased to know that this CD is anything but a let down.  Its only weak point is it has 4 or 5 mellow songs that don't really fit in with the apparent theme of the rest of the album.  Overall, though, it is a great CD and is worth what you pay.
0399146253|4.0|After Patricia Cornwell's disaster of a novel in &quot;Black Notice,&quot; I was quite skeptical and queasy about reading &quot;The Last Precinct,&quot; but I felt that urge to read it. I am very glad that I did. This book is so much better than &quot;Black Notice.&quot; The summary on Amazon.com and Patricia Cornwell's website says that the book goes on about a hundred year murder mystery case, and Kay Scarpetta is investigating it. That is not true. This book takes place about five days later from where &quot;Black Notice&quot; left off at. Eighty percent of this novel is about the preparation for the trial that is coming up over the serial killer and attacker of Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Jean-Baptiste Chandonne, who was captured at the end of &quot;Black Notice.&quot; Chandonne makes up an incredibly absurd story, saying that he was framed for all the murders that he did by the government, CIA, FBI, and other branches. He makes it sound like he is a pawn in a chess game. He says that the government is just using him to get to his powerful drug infested family in Paris, France. He says that Kay Scarpetta is part of the conspiracy and says that he was just trying to talk to Kay at her house and SHE ATTACKED HIM! Unfortunately, many reporters and government officials believe this nutcase and Kay Scarpetta is going to go on trial for the murder of Diane Bray, one of the victims of Chardonne's killing spree. Kay Scarpetta, along with slob and drunken faced cop, Pete Marino, and with Kay's lesbian niece Lucy (whom I detest greatly), must try and prove Kay's innocence. While they are doing that, they all discover that some of Kay's closest colleagues and acquaintences are involved with Jean-Baptiste Chandonne and his powerful family, who are drug dealers and gun dealers. Kay and the slob (Marino) must bring down these people to get to the truth of the matter. Unfortunately, Dr. Kay discovers that Benton Wesley, her old lover who died in &quot;Point of Origin&quot; may not havedied by the hands of Carrie Grethen, who the police and Kay both thought killed Benton. Finally when Kay puts all the pieces together, she discovers that she needs to bring down the whole Chandonne and find out who the true killer of Benton Wesley is before she is found guilty and rots in a prison cell. In the middle of the novel, Lucy and her lover, Tiel ask Kay if she wants to join them with their new organization, called THE LAST PRECINCT, a new independent crime fighting organization. Will Dr. Kay Scarpetta quit her job as a medical examiner of Virgina? Will she be going to prison for the rest of her life? Who really killed Benton Wesley? The answer to all these questions and more are all revealed in one of Patricia Cornwell's best novels, &quot;THE LAST PRECINCT!
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn is a beautiful Christian women who did a wonderful job with this album.  Im sure you already have it but if you don't please get it.
B00004XONN|2.0|I'm quite pleased to see that the most recent reviews of KID A are negative.  These are music-lovers who gave this CD a chance, instead of slapping on the knee-jerk &quot;brilliant&quot; label after one listen.  Reality is indeed setting in, and in another six months it will be unanimous:  This album's a stinker.<br />If Radiohead is the Pink Floyd of our generation, then KID A is the UMMAGUMMA (disc 2) of the band's discography.  This is not the radical advance in musical sensibilities that critics are slobbering over.  This is self-indulgent junk.  Note to Radiohead:  If you're going to &quot;experiment,&quot; do do on your dime, not mine.<br />Other British rock groups (ELP, Yes, sometimes Floyd) have &quot;liberated&quot; themselves from previous rock'n'roll ideas to make bloated, posturing, pretentious music.  Now Radiohead has made the same mistake.<br />I'm so harsh on this CD because Radiohead is one of the best bands of the 90s.  Their previous two albums are modern-day classics.  Even &quot;Optimistic&quot; and &quot;In Limbo&quot; from KID A are fantastic.  But they're merely diamonds in a pile of sludge.  KID A is a regression, not an advance.  If you are new to Radiohead, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT start with this album.  You'll scratch your head and wonder what all the fuss is about.  Lord knows I am when &quot;Treefingers&quot; is playing.<br />Years from now, we'll look back on KID A as either a transitional album to other classic CDs, or the beginning of the end.  I predict it will be the former.  The only good thing about KID A is that it's already making me excited for their next album.  Two stars because Radiohead is better than this.  One can only hope that on their next album, they'll actually play guitars.
B00002DE2L|4.0|This is an enjoyable version of Vivaldi's famous sonata which is also one of the earliest known program pieces.  This version centres on the violin playing of Anne-Sophie Mutter.  The virtuoso ability for which she is known is readily apparent.  As a result, the Trondheim Soloists are overshadowed.  For example, the harpsichord is often featured more prominently in Spring than Knut Johannesen plays in this interpretation.  The adagio molto of Autumn eschews a flamboyant harpsichord solo for a more reserved reading, and in the Hunt, I found I was forced to strain my ear to hear the happy trills from the keyboard.  Which is to reiterate the dominance of Mutter who is more than up to the task and I am not disappointed.  There is a great deal of energy, excitement and bravado in her playing.  I especially enjoyed &quot;Winter Frozen shivering in the icy snow&quot; for the aural painting it projects.  I enjoy the thrill of Tartini's Sonata in G minor, also.  Mutter makes it exciting and daring.  I personally, do not appreciate the packaging.  However, I found it could be replaced by a conventional CD jewel case -- no harm done.   If you are interested in the violin playing of Anne-Sophie Mutter or in a violin-centric reading of Vivaldi's famous Four Seasons, this CD will be interesting to you.
B00004XOWM|5.0|I love the new cd by Fred, Wes, Sam, John and DJ Lethal.  If you loved Significant Other, you will love this one also.  I don't have a favorite song cause I love them all.  The One sums up my looking for Mr. Right, but anyway thats a different story.  Buy this cd, its worth the money.
B00000K0DT|1.0|The fact of the matter is that Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie's USUAL SUSPECTS is one of the best films to come out of the studio system in the last ten years.  However, all of their marvelous work is for naught when MGM releases this horrible example of MPEG recording technology.  No attention was paid to the cleanliness of the image, thereby creating a picture that looks like I downloaded it off the internet.  Newton Thomas Sigel's contrasty neo-noir cinematography is jumbled with ghosts of character's shirts, velour blinds and other mistakes of modern technology.  While DVD normally would provide the average cinephile everything they could possibly want, this sad example of the future is annoying and ultimately makes one pine for seeing it projected in a ratty neighborhood theatre.  Do yourself a favor - find a widescreen VHS version.
6303540082|5.0|This is the famous account of the 1990 Blond Ambition Tour, complete with lots of backstage and hotel footage, sometimes bringing in the famous such as Warren Beautty, who in one memorable scene complains about madonna's desire to always be infront of a camera. The live footage is pretty hot, shot during some of the blond ambition american tours. The version of 'like a virgin' is delightfully sleazy. for an insight into the life during a major concert series, an insight into madonna, and for the spectable of various sizeable egos colliding, THIS IS A MUST SEE! it is not as honest as it purports to be, but it is the closest as any preformer is likely to let his/hers audience
B00004XQP4|4.0|With WARNING, Green Day finds (IMHO) the balance they were searching for on Nimrod (a great album itself, but in ways a bit lopsided).  With these 12 expertly crafted songs, Green Day walk the perfect line between their anti-authority past and their more grown up side which first showed itself on &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life&quot;.  Not to be repetitive, but it is true that &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot; succeeds in the same way, and to a larger extent, in establishing their more mature side.  They even offer a cautionary tale in the rollicking &quot;Jackass&quot;, which takes a direct stab at the very people they used to be.  Not an easy thing to pull off without sounding overly self deprecating, but Green Day do it quite well.<br />If you want Green Day just as it used to be, go for Insomniac or Dookie....if you want Green day as it used to be and a lot older and wiser, get your hands on Warning.  You won't be disappointed.
B00004XONN|5.0|Right.  They finally did away with the overblown power anthems, the screeching guitars, the weepy vocals, and all the other rock posturing that previously weighed them down.  What they have to offer now is something that gets closer to the meaning of their world than anything before.  Congratulations Radiohead!
B00000J8EK|3.0|I enjoy the music on this CD.  Alot of it reminds me of psychedelia from the late sixties.  As with many others who have written, LET FOREVER BE reminds me of the Beatles in their RUBBER SOUL phase.  SUNSHINE UNDERGROUND is no Superman playing hurdy gurdy, even so, it is peppered with images of Sargent Lucy walking down the lane to find a penny but tripping into fields of strawberries under a diamond sky. Hope Sandoval should have asked Alice before she went ASLEEP FOR DAY playing the part of Nico as chanteuse.  DREAM ON your pillow of surrealism.   The acquisition of New Order on OUT OF CONTROL is a joyful day at the beach for me.  The krafty MUSICal RESPONSE, reminds me of a time when Wir fahrn fahrn fahrn auf der Autobahn with munchies in total SURRENDER wondering if I GOT GLINT? I won't tell you about the bats -- you'll see them soon enough.  If you are willing to put aside Block Rockin' Beats for an hour, and get into the farout, this CD will be interesting to you.  Turn On, Tune In; Don't you want to trip like they do? ;D
B000002HHB|5.0|Merchant always struck me as precious and affected - only a little better than the unspeakable Jewel. But this CD (which I got as a present) really is tremendous; one of those, like Big Star's Third, which seems to yield only one good song at first, but ends up sounding like a greatest hits collection. &quot;I May Know the Word&quot; is a masterpiece, but I like 'em all. Even though the songs are quiet, they are not dull or background music; each song is going somewhere, has something to say, and builds up to a climax. Get this CD, guys - it's more than just chicks' music!
B00004RF9B|5.0|This is a MUST for you, an SF fan. Mind storming revelation of what you have in your deep unconsciousness, say `id' as Freud named it. Imagine what could happen if your `id' is materialized and set free out there. Compare this movie with Michael Crichton's &quot;Sphere&quot;.<br /> HOWEVER, wait and see if the price goes down further. I bought this DVD at $16.98 a few weeks ago, and now(when I'm writing this review) it's $15.98. I enjoy buying books and DVDs at Amazon, but this weired price policy of Amazon sucks; Makes me feel I got fooled. :(
0780631684|3.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed watching Final Destination. There are definitely some flaws in the story--it would have been more believable if &quot;death&quot; was natural rather than supernatural as they portray it in the movie. Anyway, the DVD version has an alternate ending and some deleted scenes.  Worth buying? Maybe not.
B00000613T|5.0|In this recording of Mahler's 9th Symphony, I find two things of great significance.  First is the fact that it is performed at a tempo just barely fast enough to fit onto one CD.  Some may think that the performance will or could suffer from such treatment.  However, I never get the feeling that the symphony is being rushed.  The performance is controlled (something Boulez has been known for), but beyond that, it has a sense of accomplishment in that the message that Mahler was trying to portray is caught and translated onto disc.  Only two other performances have been able to do this: both of Karajan's performances.  In certain spots, Bernstein and Zander show brilliance, but on the whole, their performances lack something.  It must be an enigma because I can't place my finger on what is missing from their performance.  In the end, a listener must judge a performance on how it makes them feel.  Von Karajan and Boulez move me in their performances of Mahler's 9th symphony.  Zander and Bernstein impress but fail to persuade.  Given that this performance is on one CD I'd recommend it to money-conscious buyers, however, my first picks are definitely Herbert von Karajan's performances (either of them).
B00003CXHJ|3.0|Let me first suggest that while watching the movie U-571, we think and honor Marian Rejewski and the Polish team of Mathematicians who first broke the code for the Enigma machine in 1932 and the British team working at Bletchley Park who continued the work of the Polish during WWII. <br />It's sad that Hollywood has yet again resorted to the distortion of the truth in favor of big budget dollars, and preying on the ignorance of movie-goers. Let me also suggest, that in doing so, Hollywood yet again does a great in-justice to our men and women from the United States and from around the world who fought in WWII. <br />To boast that this movie reflects actual events is mis-leading, and the viewer should be cautious as the writers and director took great liberties in distorting the truth, and history itself. <br />However, to say the budget did not go all out in effects would be wrong. I was quite apppreciative of the action, the acting, and the all around brain candy this movie provided. In fact, I look forward to adding this movie to my collection so long as those who watch also endure a brief history lesson.
B00001OH7T|4.0|Bowie never caught my attention, except for &quot;SpaceOddity&quot; (which I still think a great song), until this LP. The horns throughout are at the core of this LP's forward motion and beat. &quot;Young Americans&quot; knocks your socks off from the intro. This song is fun and eludes to being something substanative (and maybe it is in some abstract way). It didn't matter whether it was full of profundity or not for me, it has a beat that sounds energized and relevant twenty-five years later. I really thought this was going to be a trend in a new kind of music, perhaps it was a forerunner to the &quot;New Wave&quot; of the 80's. &quot;Win&quot; has that Motown sound. Really moves smooth! &quot;Fascination&quot; not a hit by itself but a great LP filler song that keeps the momentum going. &quot;Right&quot; sounds like something the Spinners would have done. Kind of jazzy and soulful. &quot;Somebody Up There Likes Me&quot; the most Motown song on the LP. Again the horns are the centerpiece along with Bowie's voice. Sit back and enjoy this one. &quot;Across The Universe&quot; is a whole new interpretation from Lennon's two versions. This one has a defiance and militance that Lennon's did not. Lennon's was tender and vulnerable. Bowie's is self-assured and almost cocky. Really, really like this version. &quot;Can You Hear Me&quot; is the most tender song on this LP. Of all the songs this one stays in my head when I take off the headphones. Bowie knows how to manipulate words into a seductive string of sweet nothings. &quot;Fame&quot; pairs Bowie and Lennon in what must have surprised even them. It must be a hoot to talk about the burdon of being famous when you're mega-famous. Sort of like the burdon of having mega-millions and bemoaning how hard it is to spend it all. This song is one of Bowie and Lennon's best. My cd has three bonus tracks not listed here. &quot;Who Can I Be Now&quot; doesn't fit into the LP. Not a bad track or an especially inspiring one. Nice to have it included but doesn't add much of anything to the original concept. &quot;It's Gonna Be Me&quot; has some really slick guitar playing. This one fits into the original concept much better. Bluesy and soulful. &quot;John, I'm Only Dancing Again&quot; I think this is a bad take-off of the BeeGee's &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot;. I would have left this track off the cd.

0060976624|4.0|Nick Naylor is your classic American weasel.  Like Bill Clinton at the cutting edge of convincing his country that he didn't have sex with Monica, Nick almost persuades America that smoking is good for you.  As a tobacco lobbyist and two-timing master of manipulation, Nick bolsters the smoking world.  He slivers his way through Clean Lungs conventions and talk shows with Oprah and Larry King, squashing his health-crazed rivals and attaining the crown to his profession.  But Nick obtains more than just a pay increase.  He must brave a mass of enemies involving his jealous boss, BR, his alluring assistant, Janette, the non-smokers of society, and fanatical abductors who try to kill Nick with nicotine patches.  Nick's only outlet from the havoc is when he's lunching with his two best friends, the spokespeople for the alcohol and firearms industries, or-when he's getting laid.        Although Christopher Buckley creates a humorous mockery of corporate America, this novel contains some loopholes.  The language can be too elaborate at times, tripping up the reader before he can ingest the action.  Nevertheless, I recommend this read.  The plot portrays the wicked reality behind what moves the money of America, while the suspense keeps the pages turning.
B00004YKUX|4.0|I'll be the first to admit, I could listen to Johnny Cash sing *anything*...and his huge, dark-toned voice has only gotten better as the years have otherwise ravaged him. Only Johnny Cash could possibly cover both Neil Diamond and Will Oldham on the same album, and still come away with an LP that makes sense. The release is peppered with recent Cash originals, which are brilliantly simple and honest testaments to love, god, life... The covers are masterfully chosen. I would argue that the release is worth the price of admission simply for his take on the Will Oldham-penned &quot;I See A Darkness&quot;, which is utterly heart-paralyzing. Hearing Oldham sings this song will stop you in your tracks, hearing Cash sing it will change your life. He also bends Tom Petty's &quot;I won't back down&quot; to his own dark, ultimtaely redemptive means. Altogether, the album is very satsifying package. With Cash's health constantly in question, it is simply amazing to see him still operate on this level. As the millinium hubub slowly dies down, and the dust settles, I think a case will need to be made for Johnny Cash as one of the best singers that 20th century produced. This, joining his last two releases on American, certainly can only help his case.
B000003EUL|5.0|This is THE Brahms 2, played by Richter at his best - his magnificently commanding virtuosity at its most smilingly joyous and confident, and Leinsdorf and the orchestra are on equally great form. The 1960 recording presents a realistic acoustic and balance, and the strings sound as they should - like a BODY of instruments, surpassing many a more modern recording. Orchestral tuttis are therefore thrillingly three-dimensional. Richter's big chordal passages are thrown off with tremendous aplomb. He was making his first appearances in the USA when this recording was made, and it surely captures the magic promised by the meeting of already legendary Russian virtuoso and great American orchestra. Perhaps it's this which gives the recording that indefinable feeling of rightness that characterises recordings we call classic or great. When orchestra and soloist usher in the hushed return of the opening horn theme midway through the first movement, time seems to stand still - its one of those sublime moments of truly great music-making that make you catch your breath. Here then is a recording of Brahms 2 with all the excitement of a live performance, yet technical security is taken for granted by all concerned so that they can focus on making music together. Other recordings of this concerto, notably the Gilels, are lauded as highly as or even higher than this one; I don't know why. The Gilels recording sounds harsh and the performance feels studio-bound by comparison. Richter and Leinsdorf breathe a freer air, their disc feels like a live performance caught on the wing. That you get a fabulous Appassionata thrown in just makes a great disc completely unmissable. If you come across Richter's own comments disdaining this performance, please allow even the great man to misjudge himself on occasion... He seems to have found it on reflection too vigorous, but its power (as well as its breathtaking beauty) is what makes it so great.
B00004XOWM|4.0|After 2 smash hit cd's Limp Bizkit shows that they are still in both the rock game and most definately in the rap game.  With Tracks like Getcha Groove on with Xzibit, Fred shows that he can rap and nobody can doubt his skills.  With tracks like Rollin Fred shows that no matter how much he raps he is still the man and he can rock hard.  And for a second straight cd they put a love song in there and if that song is brilliant.  Everyone should have this cd and have it soon.
B00004U2A1|5.0|Evil dead 2, while being a sequel, is in my opinion, the best of the trilogy. Everything a true horror fan wants is on abundant display.

B00004W510|5.0|The Band were basically a Canadian band (Levon Helm being the lone American among the five), but they were able to tap into and convey the stories and sounds of America's heartland better than any band from this country ever had or has since.  They were such adept musicians that they could play an immense variety of instruments that give the group a sound that was original and different.  You get everything from the hoe-down feel of &quot;Rag Mama Rag&quot;, the sound of a civil war dirge in &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot; to the sweet and wavering  &quot;Whispering Pines&quot; to the sing along &quot;Across The Great Divide&quot; to the optimistic &quot;King Harvest&quot;.  The album sounds like it could have been recorded at some dancehall in the middle of Kansas.  The remastering gives the album a new and fresh sound and the alternative takes provide a glimpse into the creative genius of one the best bands of all time.
B000000OA6|5.0|The history behind Queen's last album (as a 4-peice) is well-known now... Freddie Mercury striken with AIDS, using up every bit of life energy he had creating his final works, right up until the day he passed.  The band putting aside their creative and personal differences and working together to make the magic happen once more.  Innuendo was the result, and as a whole, it is far and away Queen's best album, only rivaled by their second, Queen II.<br />  Innuendo doesn't start typically... usually Queen selects a short light-hearted intro, or a quick burst of rock, this time around though, it's Bohemian Rhapsody II, the title track, a 6 and a half minute #1 single behemoth that tackles a variety of musical styles that make Bohemian Rhapsody, and just about every other song the band's ever done, cower in it's wake.  The song 'Innuendo' is right up there with the very best they've ever done... but the best on this album is yet to come.  <br />  Some of these songs are totally autobiographical from Mercury's standpoint, such as the aforementioned Innuendo, the humorous 'I'm Going Slightly Mad', and even the off-the-wall tribute to his cats 'Delilah' has an underlying note of sadness beneath the playful exterior.  These songs are sung by a man who is certain that he is going to die very soon... and those emotions can't be replicated or faked, this entire album carries a weight of emotion with it that only makes every song stronger.<br />  Headlong and the Hitman show that Queen still knows how to rock, the latter in particular is the heaviest song they cut in years.  These are the Days of our Lives is almost tear-inducing, a beautiful 'closure' song for Mercury, recalling his past with satisfaction and looking confidently towards his new life. All God's People sounds much like George Michael's hit 'Freedom', Ride the Wild Wind isn't quite as immediate as the rest but it's a deeply textured song, almost like Phil Collins on steriods.  Don't Try so Hard and I Can't Live With You are simply amazing displays of Mercury's voice.  In fact, the entire album seems to be Mercury's reaffirmation of who the greatest rock vocalist of all time has always been.  He hasn't sounded this good since A Day at the Races (and this is not an exaggeration), and this is simply amazing considering he could barely even hold himself up to sing during the grueling sessions.  <br />  Nothing prepares for the finale of the last Queen album, though.  Bijou is a haunting, beautiful guitar peice by Brian May that almost seems to convey Mercury's spirit going to the other life, and the Show must Go On is self-explanatory, Mercury refuses to give in, despite the fact that he's near death.  The last line of the album is ... 'I have to find the will to carry on with the show.. the show must go on'.. and afterwards the words 'go on' echo into oblivion, a perfect ending to Queen's perfect album.  <br />  Innuendo hasn't been done justice by it's sales or it's overall popularity, there's not a bad song on this album and the performances by each band member are among their best.  If you're any kind of Queen fan, it's a crime to not own this.

B00003652R|5.0|I've never been much into progressive but this album rocks! I bought it almost 10 years ago and I've never grown tired of it, I keep finding something new each time I put it on,there's such a perfect of lyrics and music,such an intensity,it still leaves me wicked after all this time. The moment Fish yells out &quot;A childhood...please,give it back to me&quot; and the band launch into Treshold is so good you have to listen to it to understand what I'm talking about,and there's so much more on this album,of course Kayleigh is almost an all-time favourite but Heart of Lothian(Fish's unconventional tribute to his homeland) and Lords of The Backstage alone are worth the price of the cd,not to mention the energetic closing numbers,Childhood's End and White Feather,although this album is to be appreciated in its entirety,really. I also recommend the Clutching at Straws album and many songs both with Fish and Hogarth,but Misplaced Childhood is something unique indeed,you don't have to be a Marillion fan to enjoy this masterpiece,this record can't be labelled,it's neither progressive nor metal or pop...it's simply great,unforgettable music.
B00004X01U|1.0|I'm a huge fan of Madonna, but I was bitterly disappointed with this album. The title track is the only decent tune on the entire album, and stands in the shadow of Ray of Light.<br />I managed to get a refund for this crappy album, and got Sarah McLaclan's Fumbling towards Ectasy instead, much better, buy it!
B000001EAQ|2.0|It was a cold, wet windy night in the city when the bricklayer phoned me. He sounded upset and asked me to find out what had happened to his favorite band, U2. The name rang a bell, so I went down to my local bar and found it on the jukebox. It was supposed to be Rock'n'Roll, but it sounded more like clubby, dance music. There were samples, overdubs, and distortions all over the shop, nothing that sounded like classic rock guitar, and too much irony for my taste. I decided to find out what was going on. <br />I was in luck Bono and the gang were in town, staying at some fancy Playboy Mansion. I drove out there, climbed the wall, gave the doberman a steak and caught them down by the pool.   &quot;Reach for the stars boys,&quot; I yelled as I pulled out my rod.  After they had stopped touching each other, I asked them to spill the beans. <br />&quot;We wanted to be liked by the critics,&quot; Bono confessed. &quot;Dance rock crossovers were really trendy, flavor of the month, that kind of thing.&quot;<br />&quot;What about your fans, those simple hard working guys who like to come home and put on some good old fashioned emotive, chest-thumping rock and roll?&quot;<br />&quot;Who?&quot; he asked with a puzzled expression. <br />&quot;I'm talking 'bout the joes who cough up greenbacks to keep you guys in business.&quot;<br />&quot;Oh that big thing with lots of heads that comes to our concerts,&quot; the Bass Player chipped in.<br />&quot;Listen buddy, unless you want to Wake Up like a Dead Man. You're a rock band so take off those silly shades and start behaving like one, okay.&quot;
B00004TH7Z|5.0|As a long time metal fan that cut his teeth on MC5, Blue Oyster Cult, Black Sabbath, then onto DIO, Priest, Maiden, and the Scorps, it is good to hear quality metal again.  While the CD features plenty of familiar, stereotypical &quot;Maidenisms&quot; in terms of intricate guitar, melodic harmonies, and deep lyrics, they have touched on some new and innovative areas of metal.  This is clearly Maiden 2000 and is the sound and shape of metal to come. Once again, Maiden sets the standard.  No need to comment on individual tracks, if you are a Maiden fan at all, BUY IT, PLAY IT LOUD, and tick off the alternative, rap, and hip hop listening [fans]!!
0812550757|2.0|Let me start off by saying I LOVED 'Ender's Game'...with that said, I just did NOT like 'Speaker For The Dead'.  It had a place here and there that had me interested in the story and all...but this story is SO DIFFERENT from 'Ender' that it almost seemed like it was written by someone else.  I liked the Orson Card I read in 'Ender' but if his writing style is more like what I read in 'Speaker' I'll just stay away from the rest of his books.  I hoped against hope that 'Xenocide' would redeem<br />what I felt, but sorry to say, it didn't.  Now IF you like these books, I am truly happy for you, however they just didn't do it for me (I don't know why, but I was just bored with them).  I have high hopes for 'Ender's Shadow' but after 'Speaker' &amp; 'Xenocide' I'll await for the paperback before I buy it.  Again my apologies to fans of these books.  I'm not a bad guy, I just didn't enjoy the books.
0684853523|5.0|And given his last few books, I think that's a safe statement.  This is only King's second non-fiction work (his first, &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, was out of print last time I looked), but he's definitely got a good track record for the genre.<br />He starts off with a brief autobiography, and we learn first-hand what makes the Master tick (i.e., how he got started and why he writes what he writes).  I'm a fan, but I had no idea that King was a recovering substance abuser (sorry for the spoiler, folks) until I read this book - or that his mother was (not by choice) a single parent.  King doesn't spare us or himself - he delivers the full story of his life until now, warts and all.<br />Then he launches into what he believes makes a good writer (at least, what worked for him).  Most of this is, of course, just common sense - at least, it does now that I've read it.  But it's King's style of writing that's the hook here.  He doesn't use big words, and his explanations are easily understandable by the average person on the street.<br />I do have some disagreements with King, though.  For one thing, he apparently praises John Grisham, one of the worst writers ever to make the best-seller lists.  He says, &quot;critics who dismissed THE FIRM and Grisham's later books as poorly written and who profess themselves to be mystified by his success are either missing the point because it's so big and obvious or because they are being deliberately obtuse.&quot;  He then says that Grisham wrote about something he knows, and that makes the book &quot;brave and uniquely satisfying.&quot;  Sorry, Stephen - but that's EXACTLY the point - the fact that Grisham is writing about something he knows doesn't detract from the fact that his style is something out of a &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; book, and that he probably took lessons on other facets of the craft from Danielle Steele or Jackie Collins.<br />But that's only my opinion.  It doesn't detract from the fact that in general, King haswritten an excellent primer on writing.<br />One other thing.  The last section of the book deals with King's auto accident in 1999.  Again, he doesn't omit any of the details of this portion of his life.  He will have to update it for the paperback version, since Bryan Smith died a month or so ago.
0380788624|5.0|This is the best book that I have read in a long time.  Stephenson weaves the story back and forth through time and place expertly.<br />This is a big story, with tons of details and characters.  Most lines come together very nicely, but just enough is left open for a sequel.<br />If you have any interest in technology, history, or just good character development, get this book.
B00004XOWM|1.0|If I could give this l/4 star, I would!  This is the biggest ripoff CD of the year 2000.  It is utter filth and garbage.  This group is only interested in ripping off teenagers that bought this based on the group's name.  To continually use the &quot;F&quot; word throughout the album, just promotes this band's ignorance.  They lack originality, morals and disgrace the music industry.  Don't waste your time buying this CD, you will just promote them to do another piece of garbage and be putting your hard earned money in their pocket.  There is plenty more to choose...
0812589041|5.0|I was in a slump and picked up 'Ender's Game' mostly because the selection I had to choose from wasn't all that great...however I obviously made the right choice.  This book isn't at all like other science fiction novels I have read.  As I have talked with others' who have read this book and read some of the reviews the oft-repeated opinion of this story is that those who read it could identify with it because of Ender and the way he was portrayed.  I have to echo those statements as well.  Ender seemed to be an extension of my earlier life in school, how I viewed the world, and how I was treated by others.  I was also drawn into the plot that Card has created here as well.  Not only was it entertaining, but creative without trying to be sophisticated.  All in all, Battle School was very similar to MY school (only mine was on Earth...) and since I am cheap, I am patiently waiting for the paperback edition of 'Ender's Shadow' and hopefully it is as good as the reviews say it is.  I also understand ANOTHER new book is nearing publication in the world of Ender Wiggen.  Before I wrap up, I have to say that this is the ONLY science fiction book I know of that many people have read that are anything BUT sci-fi lovers.  This book transcends a LOT of areas that most novels don't even come close to approaching.  My pre-apologies to lovers of the other sequels of Ender's Game...sorry but I just COULDN'T get into them at ALL. They were SO different that they seemed completely UNRELATED. I thought it was just me, but I have come across many others who also feel the same way.  I have also attempted to read them more than once thinking maybe, just maybe they would appeal to me at a later time...nope, nosiree Bob.  Didn't work.  Sorry.  But Ender's Game WAS and IS absolutely wonderful.
B000002ADT|5.0|I don't know if Miles Davis knew it at the time but he made a masterpiece when he made Kind of Blue.  It is a phenominal piece of music from beginning to end.  I have listened to it many times and specially when doing work on my pc.  This is music that really takes me away. Quick story:  I have a friend who had never heard jazz before and I asked him if he did not mind me playing the cd. He agreed and I put it on, right off the bat he was hooked the same day he went and bought it and now he is a fan of jazz music. If that does not convince you that this cd is an absolute marvel then nothing will. peace.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Fans of Limp Bizkit shouldn't be disappointed by this CD.  Although any true fans should have the CD by now.  I prefer this CD to Significant Other, even though that CD was great too.  Limp Bizkit again goes from hard (rollin') to relatively soft (the one).  I bought the limited edition 2 CD set, but I don't believe the extra song is good enough to buy that unless you have the need to say you have the limited edition.
B00004TFK3|4.0|The &quot;Men in Black&quot; limited edition is one of the best DVDs available.  It is loaded with entertaining features and has a very funny commentary with star Tommy Lee Jones.<br />The film itself is very funny and doesn't wear out it's welcome.  It's a good purchase.
B000023VR6|4.0|No doubt about it, Dr. Dre has once again come up with a brilliant rap recording with fresh beats and compelling soundscapes, skits that don't burn out after the first couple of spins, and one superb, ear-arresting track after another.  For the haters that declared Dre was ovah while they bit his style, &quot;2001&quot; is vindication and then some.  My favorite cuts?  &quot;Let's Get High,&quot; &quot;Still Dre,&quot; &quot;What's the Difference,&quot; &quot;Next Episode,&quot; the hilarous &quot;Pause for Porno&quot; and tender (yep, I did say tender) &quot;The Message&quot; with a whole stack of Mary J. Bliges in the background.  Maybe the best rap album of the year, definitely one of the best albums of any genre of the year.  And yes...it is misogynistic, drug friendly and offensive.
B00004XOWM|4.0|It it a pretty good CD i especially like Rollin Urban Assault vehicle.  It has alot of colaborations with great rappers like Exzhibit and Methodman.
B00004YKSD|5.0|Val Kilmer's extraordinary portrayl of rock legend Jim Morrison is timeless. The film has progressively become a cult classic because of it's chaotic yet introspective tale concerning The Doors and Morrison's rise as a legend.
B00003W8NM|5.0|At first I didn't want to watch this film because it looked like a poor excuse to exploit violence.  I was forced to watch the film, but after the first ten minutes, i was hooked. The plot line follows an average joe-shmoe (Norton) who's life is going down the sewer.  He then meets Tyler (Pitt), a do-it-yourself kind of mentor.  Together they create &quot;Fight Club&quot;, a free organization of beating.  But this is just the start. Fight club contains great plot twists and every scene is AMAZING.<br />The acting is top-notch and David Fincher (director) keeps the same satire-yet-drama feel as the book.  A must see for everyone.  Men, women, and...well maybe not children.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This cd rocks if you like limp bizkit you'll love this  I give it 2 thumbs way up.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I first heard about Radiohead from my brother, but it was not until this summer that I first heard them. At first  I wasn't too blown away  by them, but recenty I decided to take a chance and pick up Ok Computer, this time I was blown away. From the opening lines of Airbag to the Microwave ring slowly fading at the end of The Tourist I was entranced. Every song on this cd is amazing and unlike many other cd's I own there is not a bad song on this cd, and it is the only cd that I own that I don't skip any song, with the exception of Radiohead's latest cd Kid A. Unlike many other artist's on todays market, Radiohead does not lure you in with the latest hit single, and also unlike many artists today, every single song on this cd is different, each one entrancing you in a different way.  So the next time you are in the market for a new cd pick up Ok Computer I promise you wont regret it.
B000002NIW|5.0|One of the most spine tingling CD's that I have ever had the pleasure of listening to.  Dai the Flu runs through my head on a daily basis.  This CD is less electronic(i guess you could say) than White Pony, its absolutely incredible.
0553275569|5.0|Don't get me wrong, the movie was terrifically fun, but the level of detail is necessarily much lower than in the book.  Whole portions are left out (flights between John Glenn's and Gordo Cooper's for instance) and others are treated lightly (the astronaut selection process).  Reading this book in 1999, I was able to glance into another seemingly more innocent and black &amp; white time.  To read about the naivete of the pilots prior to joining the Mercury program is a nice change from the everpresent cynicism of our modern era.  This book is patriotic, yes, but it is also an historical work, and a gripping one at that.  If you think you know it all from the movie, guess again.  Go buy it.
0684800713|5.0|those people who say that the book is useless because of its apparant lack of any plot or story or what-have-you are missing the point (if there ever is a point. hmmm...); a novel. let us think. a novel is a snapshot of a time a place an incident the lives of some people whom to them the actions are meaningful. to say these events set forth are pointless and therefore this damns the entire novel is akin to saying that y'know i don't know lets pick something at random, say marvin gaye 'lets get it on'. now the power and beauty of this song cannot merely be expressed through saying it is just about sex as this book cannot be summed up simply by saying it is about people drinking, nor can 'taxi driver' be summed up by saying it is all about one man who has guns and shoots them. i dont know; i just think that some people are expecting too much synthesis too much summing up of everything from one novel which yu just cant get ever ever ever. 'sar' is as beautiful as otis redding singing &quot;you left the water running&quot; and that cannot be summed up by saying its about one man whose girlf left the water on! the emotional power comes out through something more, perhaps something personal to you. and in some sense the lack of any great overacrhing commentray in 'sar' is its point; hemingway cant express whatever there is to express because of the horror! the horror! &amp; stoicism, its all underneath, iceberg etc, 9/10 underneath surface....look for the gaps. alll i know is that th' book meant as much to me as hearing bob dylan or elvis or al green or seeing the godfather for the first time or whatever. dont be misled by my email address either, yes i like hemingway but not that much that i cant criticse him (&quot;across the river and into the trees&quot; is total crap)...

0393316041|4.0|Okay, the man had/has a cult of personality, and he was flawed.  Aren't we all?  Fact is he was one of the greatest minds of the century and he had a unique and sometimes uncompromising view of the world.  I picked this book up by chance, and now I'm reading about chaos theory, subatomic particles, quarks.  The man had a way of convincing people that these things were not and should not be beyond them.  The stories in this book point out his humor, his desire to teach and learn and his showmanship.  A curious character indeed.  Read it!
6305095574|5.0|Without question the greatest horror film ever made. A masterpiece. Make sure the kids are well tucked away in their beds and long asleep. There's enough violence here to warp their entire life. They're in bed? Good. Pop the DVD in and hold on tight for the bloodiest rollercoaster ride of your life! Axes, chainsaws, demonic possesion, horny trees - its all here! Truly a Saturday night classic for generations to come. When all is said and done, you can clean the blood off your T.V. It splashes everywhere in this flick!
076790382X|5.0|This is my favorite Bryson book (so far).  Having lived in Europe myself, I can relate a bit to the shock of returning home to America in all her glory.  Mr. Bryson's observations on the post office, the grocery store, walking vs driving...all clever and funny, but too too true.  I never thought I'd read a travel book about my own country, but there you have it.  This one's worth your time.  If you'll excuse me, I have to drive next door and buy a box of toaster-pizza.
B00004XOWM|5.0|The cd is great! Well that is a couple songs are great! Which is most of them LOL! Well I just LOVED it! The best songs are My Generation, Rollin' (air raid vehicle), Getcha groove on, Take a look around, and Rollin' (urban assault vehicle)! All I am really saying iz GO GET THE CD!
630575067X|2.0|I understand that folktales reach out to us because they are familar to us, yet I can't help but wish that Lucas would do something new and different.  I have no idea why the Jar Jar character is here, no idea why they felt the need to explain the &quot;force&quot; in bad psuedo-science terms, and little respect for something that seems more geered toward making money off of toys than entertaining an audience.  I was very very disappionted.
B0000024ZC|5.0|Gentle Giant was one of the lesser-known prog bands of the 70's, but don't let their lack of radio hits scare you away.  This band had everything a great progressive rock group should have:  Complex lyrics and arrangements, lofty concepts,and above all virtuoso musicianship.<br />THREE FRIENDS is a &quot;suite&quot; of sorts in six parts, describing the relationship of (you guessed it) three friends as they go their different directions in life.  It's an interesting concept, but one that's not really necessary to follow in order to enjoy the album.  The music stands on its own merits.  <br />This album runs the gamut from quasi-medieval harmonies to hard-driving guitar solos, with everything in between.  It's incredibly eclectic, but still manages to fuse together into a cohesive whole, especially after repeated listenings.<br />I recommend THREE FRIENDS highly.  My one complaint is that it's a very short album, but even that works in a vinyl nostalgia sort of way.  If your tastes run to progressive music, this is a worthy addition to your collection.
6304143184|4.0|There is nothing innately wrong with sentimental however the &quot;cuteness&quot; factor on this was a bit overwhelming at times.  I could however emphasis with the main characters, human and non-human so I stayed interested in the story.  Have never quite figured out the flying bike thing.  The family seemed very well though perhaps a bit to gender typed.
B00004XONN|5.0|I have little to say about Radiohead's newest album.  It has become a little to personal to talk about to the anonymous masses.  I recommend anyone who is interested in where music is headed to buy this album.  &quot;Kid A&quot; is a litmus test for the openminded and progressive.  This is the most important album since, well..&quot;OK Computer.&quot;  Radiohead is just operating on a different level.
B00000K2SC|5.0|I must admit I have a fondest for Keanu Reeves but I don't see everything he is in and I am a picky science fiction fan.  That said the effects were wonderful, the twists entertaining, the questions about the nature of reality intriguing, and the sound track intense.  Of course this is a rehash of the &quot;machine will be humanity's downfall&quot; but an interesting turn on the old idea of mere slave or destruction.
B00003CX8J|5.0|Not only have I been a long time X-men fan, but have antisipated the arival of the Uncanny X-men to the silver screen for a long time. This movie lived well up to its expectations, with special effects that eat Jurassic Park for lunch, and fight scenes that would knock out The Matrix, X-men, was undoubtedly the most enjoyable film of the summer. <br />Now myself being a huge X-Men fan, absolutely loved this movie.  But this is a movie for people that know nothing about the series also.  With a very descriptive storyline, and character interaction relatioships, X-men hit the nail on the head with orinal movie, with many sequels to come.  <br />Director Bryan Singer did an excellent job of not revealing too much of the story in two hours, but revealing just enough to keep audiences coming back for more.  Newcomer Hugh Jackman was such a resembolence to the Wolverine of the comic series, it was scary.  With the outstanding performance he gave, he will be a global superstar for sure.  With other excellent performances by Patrick Stewart, Ian Mckellan, Halle Barry and others, the X-Men series, will be the most popular since Batman for sure.<br />I highly recommend this movie to any movie fan --period.<br />With the excellent performances, direction, storyline and special effects,the X-Men most definitly, will be back.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A only recieves rave reviews, I'm beginning to notice, from people who, like myself, have even a small bit of history with the genre of IDM, or Intelligent Dance Music. Radiohead take a LOT of nods from Aphex Twin and similar artists on Kid A -- those who are even on passing terms with such music will discover that Kid A has managed to take Radiohead's earlier sound and submerge it in a new style; it's almost as if this record were a regular Radiohead record, covered in layers of an unquantifiable *something else,* melding the two perfectly to create something wholly new and original -- a feat breathtaking in its scope and stunning in its execution.<br />To those, however, who are just discovering this &quot;something else,&quot; this record probably sounds like twiddly crap. Do yourself a favor and listen to some Aphex Twin before you listen to Kid A. And if all else fails, remember that Radiohead *are* planning to release another, more &quot;conventional&quot; album in six months or so...
0446525537|4.0|If you loved Sparks' other books, you'll love this one, too.  I thought that it started slower than his other books, but once it got going, I couldn't put it down.  It's a touching story and it's a guaranteed cry :)
B00000G3HZ|5.0|This video exemplifies life and relationships I experienced firsthand as a &quot;boomer&quot;- Class of 1968.  Included in this well directed flick are a great cast of talented actors illustrating extremely believable dynamics.  And, no matter how many times I watch, my pleasure factor and interest have not diminished.
B000001OAA|5.0|I remember the time when Alternative Rock was still supreme. Before primitive bands like Limp Bizkit bored us, and shows like TRL existed, modern rock radio was overflowing with great bands. Garbage are one of those great bands. Their s/t debut is filled with huge hits, addictive chorus hooks, great production, amazing musicianship, top-notch vocals and lyrics, and it's all oh so catchy. Songs like &quot;Queer&quot; and &quot;Stupid Girl&quot; are known by just about every Alt-Rock fan worldwide, and they're obvious favorites. Personally though, my favorite track is &quot;Only Happy When It Rains&quot;. It completely mirrors my life (the lyrics sound like Shirley was reading some of my poetry), it's catchy, it's addictive, and I absolutely love it; it's tied with &quot;Milk&quot; as my favorite Garbage song. Other strong tracks are &quot;As Heaven Is Wide&quot;, &quot;A Stroke Of Luck&quot;, and &quot;Vow&quot;. I think &quot;Vow&quot;, aside from &quot;Only Happy When It Rains&quot;, is the catchiest song here. &quot;Milk&quot; is just touching. It's beautiful and haunting, dark and hopeful, potent and mesmerizing. As you can tell, I'm very much obsessed with the song. All of these songs have a moody and dark tone to them, something I absolutely love (I listen to lot of Gothic music, it's one of my favorite genres). In fact, I remember reading somewhere that Garbage are like the modern day Siouxsie &amp; The Banshees. Though I've never been a big fan of that band, I can see why that was said, as Garbage posses a moody aura. Please, don't dismiss Garbage as &quot;just a girl band&quot; because of your ignorance, this really is an amazing band. I really can't praise this CD enough, no filler, no bad tracks, no boring songs, it's just that damn good. I'm glad to see that at least Garbage are still holding strong and making great songs through this depressing state of music. You cannot go wrong buying this CD, I don't see a reason as to why you shouldn't own this. Now,if only their new CD would arrive sooner.......
B00004XONN|5.0|There is something about Radiohead, they just seem to be able to do what needs being done. Kid A, the long awaited (three year) follow up to what many call the best album of all time, OK Computer, measures up uniquely as the progression of all their previous albums. At first listen, one eyebrow raises. Does anybody really like a Radiohead album on first listen? I hated The Bends when it came out, then I loved it, I badmouthed OK Computer when it came out and have since, in repent, decided to shave a few years off my life for such blasphemy (those few years will be donated to the lifespan of the album, so, if my calculations are correct, OK Computer will fall from favor in the year 2388 plus three years from me, so that puts it at 2391...). So, am I really a good judge, a worthwhile reviewer? No. But, you are reading anyway.       I am of the to-understand-Kid-A-one-must-understand-OK-Computer school of thought. I believe that all of Radiohead's releases, album releases anyway, are concept albums, and, furthermore, I believe that you can string them all together like popcorn on a string. They exist simultaneously as the past present and future of what we all can identify with, as my friend puts it, &quot;I wasamwill-be here&quot;. If Pablo Honey (the seeds were sewn then) was about feeling isolated, different, alone, unwanted, unheard, the central character was using his one true gift of observation (that's why we all liked it so much). Then, that character moves on to The Bends, as the title suggests, the pain due to coming up too fast. That can be interpreted in many ways, and fame being only one of them, but I think, more devastatingly, our hero gets the bends just by getting up in the morning, coming up from the sea of dreams too fast, the pain of existence in a cruel and uncaring universe. In The Bends, our hero notices that the fake-plastic world is not quite all right, but through his reports (to us) he seems to be the only one who notices, all the madness, and he feels himself sinking in the quicksand, and smiling-strangers reply to his pleas for help cheerfully, they say, &quot;We cannot help you, you are on your own..&quot;. Then, we make it to OK Computer, where man-vs.-a machine-like-society. The same ones responsible for the mini-malls and chain-conveniences, to make life better, easier (fitter, happier, more productive). OK Computer is where our wild animal is beaten and trained to heal, sit, stand, smile, all the while with fear in his eyes, remembering the training and the freedom only too well. If OK Computer was training/taming man the animal, then Kid A is the domesticated, subdued, behaved result.        Kid A, on first few listens sounds a lot like AIR (French Band). While AIR has more of a seventies backdrop to their scores, Kid A is pure NOW. And, while AIR is dreamy and free, Kid A is panicky. Kid A is said to be the first cloned person, reborn into place, still in the shell of another. What an idea!        Anyway, the songs are great, textured and layered and thick and gooey. Everything In It's Right Place picks up right where we left off, full of lethargic anxiety, National Anthem is just fantastic, complete with horns. How To Disappear Completely is acoustic and sweet like several of Radiohead's B-sides, with the lulling lyrics &quot;I'm not here, this isn't happening&quot;.  Optimistic is anything but, well, it's rich in sarcasm at least. Idioteque is chock full of trademark Thom Yorke falsettos, bridge chorus's, and strange mix of yodeling, screaming and slurring. Morning Bell is Bostonian, it seems. And the lush strings in Motion Picture Soundtrack make for a wonderful ending.         You don't have to like this album, but you really should. Oh, yeah, be sure to tear apart the plastic packaging to find the secret hidden prize!
B000003TAR|3.0|couple of great songs, couple of forgetable songs , of course there are a couple of misconceptions that I would like to dispell. Mainly the idea that Kurt was the sole orignator of having a song start soft and end hard and go back and forth. ANy fan who belives this only proves why they think nirvana is the best; their knowledge of classic rock is sadly minimal. The idea of contrast can be traced back to Led Zeppelin's 69( and even farther back, try the WHO) release. Babe I an gonna leave you follows the same format, of course this was some time before nirvana ever fromed, but i guess this shows that kurt some how convinced jimmy page to follow that format. Sounds pretty dumb right ? so does the idea that nirvana is the end all best of all time , they had a lot to say and that this and Nevermind( though not bad albums) are the best and make everything look like crap .
B00000HYXB|1.0|None of Tolkien's vision is caught within, except perhaps his worst nightmare. With a band and a singer that sounds nothing more than pretentious high brow metal nerds. Yes there are metal nerds. The singing is even worse, sounding like Michael Bolton with a head cold. Tolkien's stories are just not told best through music but through words. Seriously. If as Zappa says writing about music is like dancing about architechture, then making music about books is even more useless. Didn't Rick Wakeman teach the world anything? Its not even that I don't have a stomach for metal, I do, its that I can't stand poorly executed and pretentious music in general. Can you even call this metal?<br />Music Fan....Glad she didn't spend money on this album!
6301969588|5.0|My god! This movie is so orignal and weird, no wonder they banned it in England. Just don't let young kids watch this. It freaked my little sister out, because there are really circus performers in this movie, and the end is a real kicker. I recommend it if you are not faint of heart. BOO!
0345349571|3.0|While this book has some fascinating detail of the 14th century, I don't agree that it is the most &quot;readable volume on this subject.&quot;  Tuchman goes off on tangents which make the book difficult to follow and easy to put down.
B000002WYT|5.0|I don't think there could ever be a &quot;bad&quot; DMB song.  And this cd is proof of that.  The entire cd is a great blend of different songs from calm to loud and back again.  They're like a fine wine -- they just get better with experience.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Like many people that are now reading this I have been waiting for this CD to come out since it was orginally titled &quot;Limpdependence Day&quot;. And when I finally got it I wasn't dissapointed. Limp Bizkit once again blends hip hop and Rock into an amazing album. Though some of the songs are a harder rock, and some are more rappish, I recomend it to any fan of either gendre. Some of my favriote songs are The One, and My Generation. The rest are great too. I really enjoyed some of the ballads on this album (though they are few). It's nice to see the softer side of the band.<br />I'd recommend this album to anyone that dosen't mind um... colorful lyrics and loves Rock/Hip hop blends.
B00004YKUX|4.0|This is a truly moving album - full of wisdom and wonder, wit and weariness. it starts off in an almost poppy vein with the folky twang of tom petty, but all to soon the real mood of the album comes through with the spectacularly moving double whammy of i see a darkness and the mercy seat. these two troubled prayers to God and death are the highlight of the album. maybe the highlight of Cash's career.  its an awesome album in every respect. Hell, it even makes a U2 song listenable.
0140186395|5.0|East of Eden is the kind of book that is a true joy to read.  The bittersweet ending is the highlight of this study of one family's internal conflict.  The character of Samuel is one of the richest that exists in literary history.  His words are always a comfort both to the other characters and to the reader.  East of Eden is John Steinbeck's grand opus.  Some will be daunted by the length but Steinbeck can warm any reader's heart with finely drawn characters, an intense plot, and beautiful imagery.  Do not pass on this!
B00004XOWN|5.0|This album is the best the band has ever produced! I thought it would be hard for them to beat Significant Other but with all the talent in Limp Bizkit you can count on them to produce good music. They have their own style unlike all those boy bands out there who call themselves talented! My Generation, My Way, Rollin', Livin' It Up, Take A Look Around, and Hold On are some of my favorite tracks. The Outro is hilarious too.
B000002IOJ|4.0|yet painfully aweswome the title track is an awesome song. yeah, these guys are influenced by metalica, but they carried on a traditon better thanmetalica and it shows through. i think all their albums up until their horrible attempt at death metal were good. thrash lives through this album. all the songs are great why not get it?
B00004XOWM|5.0|I think it is one of their best cds out there!! keep on doing  what you are all doing!! love ya
B00000JJQK|4.0|This is a great collection of pop songs,though not up to the level of its inspiration Rubber Soul its still a very good album,though it does have some filler.Pet  sounds is also a little insubstantial and lacking the  true beauty and cohesiveness that made Rubber Soul a masterpiece.I would have given this three stars except for the pop gem 'god only knows' brian wilsons saving grace in the rock world.And to all the beach boys fans, its really futile and unfair to compare them to the<br />beatles,by most accounts a vastly superior group,just enjoy them for what they are without unrealistic expectations.No band can expect to match the pure beauty and wonder that was the beatles,least of all a surfing band. The beatles may irritate many of you for obvious reasons, but please just enjoy the music.And believe me I really like  it ok! But sgt pepper it aint!
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is about the marriage of a guy who is at best deep at the surface. His recollections of his past at the end are none too deep either..they're shot in black and white and reminded me of early 60's nostalgia pieces like To Kill A Mockingbird, utterly unconvincing.<br />Annette Benning and Kevin Spacey as husband and wife(brillantly played by both) have entered the competitive world of America and it is shattering their marriage and their integrity. They make absurd choices that entrap them further, so that finally murder and death wishes(she wants to shoot him and he lusts for a Lolita looka like and deals with drugs with a teenager , which looks like gay sex to the teen's father..all of it crazy and risky) become suitable options for this couple who do anyhting but RULE.<br />The children of American Beauty are anti- American Dream in every way; their vocabulary is cynical jargon designed to disarm and also to protect them from the crushing world of adult relationships in which they find themselves asked to model. They look better than the adults aS they see through the sexuaL and psychological messes in front of them. They have to survive and do so with some imagination, except for the blonde girl who is Spacey's object of desire; she's dull, unimaginative, and one of them puts it, sadly knows it. <br />The Marine Major's wife with her catatonia is superb; she typifies the only stance one could take in this very real world of realtionships..silence and immobility, a willed retreat into madness as a seal on whatever humanity she has left.<br />The end  of the film shakes it all up, and the film turns into a who dunnit with the principal parties as potential suspects of murder. This throws the film into another genre..a sort of Agatha Christie plot, where Miss Marple will come and figure it all out. Kevinb Spacey leaves a puzzle behind, but it is a bland one, easy to decipher..there';s nothing worth the trouble in this world, and kids in it know it.<br/>American Beauty as a term and not a title, seen in part in the sexy use of rose petals, is a fading illusion, a cliche, and  truth, as Spacey alludes to in the end,  is nowhere to be found in this environment..as truth seems to be at the bottom of a bottomless well...like the dreams they all have, fractured by their own loneliness and sad belief that marriage is as good as it gets, or that independent living without depth is better. the gay guys  too have unfortunately assimilated and they look bad, ignoring the reality of homophobia, not wrestling with any issues at all. Part of the issues not faced by the gay couple is the marine next door trying to forge a desperate realtionship with Kevin Spacey, that becomes ultimately deadly, unfulfilled, and a bit shocking in its conclusion, but maybe the only complete intercourse in the film..it gets a little beyond the Hitler plate that the Marine keeps under glass, and closer to the white bag in motion, not stagnant. But this is all framed in a world of absurdity.<br />See this film and never mind the reviews of those who only saw it on video tape with pizza interruptions etc...It's for adults, and for people who have a background and a foreground.
B0000024SN|4.0|Most fanatics will direct you towards &quot;Bookends&quot; or &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, but the comfortable variances among &quot;Sounds Of Silence&quot; deserve recognition too.  Sure, songs like &quot;Leaves That Are Green&quot; and &quot;We've Got A Groovy Thing Goin'&quot; don't carry the musical or emotional weight of their more ambitious later work, and the morbid lyrics of &quot;Richard Cory&quot; deserve a more somber interpretation, as they do on &quot;April Come She Will&quot;, but hey, it's only their second album!  The Beatles never cited these two as an influence, but hearing this makes you wonder if they cued up this album while passing the peace pipe during the recording of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;.  Simon &amp; Garfunkel easily shift themselves into a Byrds-ian jangle stomp on &quot;Blessed&quot;, &quot;I Am A Rock&quot; and the title track.  If Dylan went electric, why can't they?<br />There are hints though, of the more complex music they would produce later.  An echoing trumpet trails throughout &quot;Somewhere They Can't Find Me&quot; and &quot;Leaves That Are Green&quot; gets its playfulness from a sprinkling harpsichord.  It's a noticeable stir for a duo whose first album was loaded heavy with Christian spirituals; now they're singing about robbery, Soho and suicide. Highly recommended for eclectic folk taste.
B0000028RR|5.0|Everyone must get the entire collection of Rage albums.  Why?  They will be their only three.  Today, Zack De La Rocha announced he was quitting the band.  And I bet the rest will disband soon afterward, so buy all three of them.  They are three of the most fun albums you will own, with this one being the very very best.
B000005RT8|3.0|Paul, always known to latch on to current trends in music now and again, takes a stab at the new wave/synthesizer craze with 1980's &quot;McCartney II&quot;.  Like 1970's &quot;McCartney&quot;, Paul wrote, performed and recorded the album in solitude, with Linda adding harmonies - hence the album title.  While his foray into keyboard cheese doesn't fare as well as his catchy flirtations with disco, this album does have moments.  However, they're usually when Paul turns off the Casio and picks up a guitar.  The opening track &quot;Coming Up&quot;, is an infectous piece of optimistic pop-funk that is still a mainstay in Paul's live shows.  &quot;On The Way&quot; is a hollowed-out blues ballad that ranks up with earlier (and overlooked) gems like &quot;Oo You&quot; and &quot;Let Me Roll It&quot;.  &quot;Nobody Knows&quot; and &quot;Bogie Music&quot; are essentially sloppy but funny boogie stomps.  The album does meet its quota of trademark McCartney sugar ballads like &quot;Waterfalls&quot;, &quot;Summer's Day Song&quot; and &quot;One Of These Days&quot; that are nonetheless lovely to sing along to.  <br />Note the import version contain the extended bonus track &quot;Secret Friend&quot;, a bubbly but simple instrumental piece that probably serves as Paul's finest attempt at synthesizer whirlwind circa 1980.
B00004XOWN|5.0|Usually I think a CD is good if I extremely like 3 or 4 songs. On this CD I LOVE 6. I expect a good CD, when I buy a CD at all. This is a Superior CD. I like Rock and Hip-Hop, and a CD like this is like having your cake and eating it too. It's one of the best crafted (musically and lyrically)discs I have ever heard. A prime example is Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle). It has sweet rhymes and an awesome Rock beat. The Band also showcases pure hip-hop (Getcha Groove On) and clear Rock (Full Nelson). Simply put this album is for fans of good music!
B000002KCC|5.0|I am a Neil Young fanatic. <br />That being said, let me just state that this is the BEST Neil Young record. Ever. <br />It took me by surprise, really-having recently picked up the other two albums in the Danny Whitten/Bruce Berry trilogy, On the Beach and Time Fades Away... I was expecting something more downtrodden and depressing. What you have here is simply Neil at his darkest best: Dark acoustic, and dark electric. It's that simple. Rolling Stone writers might endlessly wax poetic, but it comes down to that simple statement: On Tonight's The Night, Neil and various Horse(s) and Nitzsche and Nils Lofgren put together an album that has all the elements that have made Neil such an incredible force of nature. <br />Raw emotion, gallows humor (the cover portrait is no tossed-off mistake; that &quot;Hippy Lounge&quot; Neil persona pervades the entire experience)...it helps if you can imagine that man singing these songs. And the fact that there is no lyric sheet helps. For once, I let his words and sounds just seep in. It will hook you right off the bat and will just keep getting better...oh yeah, that's what the best of Neil always does!<br />This is also a good companion piece to Zuma...sort of the darker side to Zuma's soaring Horse tracks. Just buy it now.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Buy this album! Bizkit keeps up its tradition of hard rockin tunes!
B000002KD5|5.0|This album and &quot;Rumours&quot; never left the family tapedeck on our yearly trips to Southern California. And really, is there any better music to drown out the I-5 Blues? Christine's little melancholic pop ditties; Lindsey's country-hick tunes, and Stevie's Faerie Godmother poetry.....yes, while Rumours is somewhat tighter and perhaps the better-written of the two (especially in Lindsey's case: listen to &quot;Crystal&quot; a few times if you think he wrote nothing but great little banjo/rock tunes), I have recently rediscovered the wonder that is this first foray into the post-Peter Green Mac. And it grows on me every time I listen to it. <br />Christine especially shows herself to be a top-notch pop writer; there are simply no bad Christine songs here. And Stevie's tracks (&quot;Rhiannon&quot; of course, and &quot;Landslide&quot;) roll off the vinyl/digital like honey. You can almost see her skinny Californian arms reaching out to wrap you up in some Patchouli-drenched poncho to keep you warm. <br />It must also be said that despite my misgivings on &quot;Crystal&quot;, Lindsey turns in some of his best work too. World Turning (with Christine) and Monday Morning are instant Lindsey classics, of which there are loads. His banjo and acoustic and electric work here is top-notch. And that voice....<br />All in all, a must have for fans as well as those only slightly familiar with these tracks (do you people actually exist?) from 70's FM radio. This music will always stand the test of time.
6305841861|4.0|The follow up to the creepy Evil Dead is actually a remake of the same but on a more high scale level.  The transfer is quite good, but again, this movie is not that old so the original print is not that dated.  While the first of the series focused on a more surreal set, the follow up relies heavily on physical slapstick and extreme gore.  You will either find yourself totally creeped out or laughing too hard at some of the effects and send ups of horror films.  Either way, this is highly recommended viewing for fans of the horror genre.  Mostly overlooked upon it's original screening, this is fast becoming a cult classic.  Get it while it's not!
006109594X|1.0|I read a lot.  I have read techno-thrillers(all of Clancy,Coonts,James H. Cobb and many others); I have read Sea stories(all of Patrick O'Brian, C.S. Forrester,Nelson,Lambdin,etc) Also, I am a small boat sailor, a Naval Institute member and a Viet Nam veteran. Been there, done that in a lot of the areas covered in this book.  Its a shame that Mr. Robinson fails to convey any impression that he has even a nodding acquantence with the material about which he is writing.  I didn't throw the book away in the middle and I did finish it, but it was a near run thing.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|A surprise and a total shock coming from David Lynch; a director who has, in my humble opinion, disappointed me more times than not. &quot;The Straight Story&quot; is simply the best film made in the last decade and will one day finally be regarded as the masterpiece it truly is. How Disney could have bungled the marketing of this great film is beyond reasoning. It is rated G but is no more of a &quot;family&quot; film than &quot;The Tigger Movie&quot; could be considered porn. Children could never understand its deliberate pacing and complex emotional core of patience and moral responsibility. By the end of the film I was choking back tears and so moved I could hardly get out of my seat. Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek give performances that make you remember what acting on film used to mean. Please do yourself a favor and watch it somewhere quiet with no interference so that you may listen and savor this extraordinary movie. There will not be any more like it for many, many years.
0345298349|4.0|I was once a Russian speaker and junior Kremlinologist, but the closest I got to Moscow was Belgrad.  Yet when I read this book, I felt I was there.  I felt I could smell the place.  I asked an old Moscow hand if it were that authentic and she said yes.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I ran out and got this CD the very day it came out. Bruce and Adrian are back? Count me in! But I was already preparing myself for dissapointment. The '90's were rough on Maiden -- and metal in general. Could they have recovered? Did they have anything more to give after all these years? Or would this be yet another upsetting release by one of my all-time favorites (like Metallica)?<br />Well, thank God for Iron Maiden! I popped on my headphones and emerged 67 minutes later with one of the biggest smiles I've worn in ages. Every single track was great! I mean, even for Maiden, that's rare! I had heard the beginning of Wicker Man on ironmaiden.com, but the chorus (which I hadn't heard)slayed me! It was like the old Bruce, but maybe better. I think my favorite on the disc is Ghost of the Navigator - it is like so many great Maiden songs before it - it has great tempo and meter changes, a fierce gallup, and a great story. I feel like I'm being tossed about the seas when I listen to it. To me, Maiden has always been great at creating images, and they do that throughout this album. After hundreds of listenings, the album still holds up.  I have yet to tire of it!<br />If you ever liked Iron Maiden, you MUST get this album. I promise that you will not be dissapointed. For me, it was a chance for me to discover my childhood again, and to realize why I haven't really liked music in a long time. Thank you, Iron Maiden, thank you!<br />Up the Irons!
0440224764|4.0|John Grisham's reputation for a great thriller has not been damaged.  This is a great, fast-paced read with a little deception and romance tossed in to give it a well-rounded appeal.  I felt the ending was a bit predictable, the foreshadowing was too obvious to leave much question as to how it would end, but still a great story.<br />Patrick is on the run after four years and millions of dollars and is captured and tortured to reveal the location of the money.  Once the FBI takes over, Patrick reveals his plan to work his way out of almost everything that comes his way and gets a surprised in the end.
B00004W55E|5.0|THIS IS THE ONLY CD I HAVE EVERY BOUGHT WITHOUT LISTENING TO IT FIRST, THAT'S BECAUSE RACHELLE FERRELL HAS NEVER DISAPOINTED ME, THIS ALBUM IS THE BOMB, &quot;ALL PRAISE BE&quot; TO HER! I LISTEN TO THIS EVERYWHERE IN THE CAR AT HOME AT WORK, MY FAVORITE SONG OF THE ALBUM IS &quot;I CAN'T EXPLAIN&quot; I GET A CHILL WHERE I HERE THE OPENING NOTES. I LOVE GAIA (A SONG ABOUT MOTHER EARTH) AND I ALSO LOVE &quot;REFLECTION OF MY HEART&quot;, I REALLY LOVE EVERY SONG AND CAN GIVE A REVIEW ON ALL, BUT I FEAR I WON'T HAVE THE SPACE, ANYWAY IN CLOSING, GET HER OTHER TWO ALBUMS, YOU'LL LOVE THEM TOO!
B00004XONN|4.0|I've read a lot of reviews that said Radiohead was in a &quot;no win&quot; situation when trying to follow up OK Computer.  I think they've clearly won.  To me, Radiohead is all about the mood their music creates, and about finding the little nuggets of beauty buried within the recordings.  This album is loaded with them, and while the music may not be instantly accessible, upon repeated listening the melodies begin to creep up on you and take hold.  The bass riff coupled with the excellent in and out drumming on National Anthem has locked into my mind today.  Yesterday it was the beautiful Morning Bell.<br />This album is different, but really not THAT different.  If you liked The Bends and OK Computer which were very different albums from each other, you'll like Kid A.  If you're a Radiohead fan, you won't be disappointed.
B000002OVJ|5.0|The record industry--a.k.a. the bunch who sell music--don't necessarily give a flying leap what the music lover wants. This album, the Who's only decent live album, is a perfect example of that. One gem you'll find here is &quot;Tattoo&quot; from &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot;. It wasn't on the original vinyl release, and it's one of the best in this whole set. Instead, we got a long version of &quot;My Generation&quot;, which is the classic hit plus a lot of garbage and noise, making the cut at least 9 minutes too long. You'll notice that here, since they left that track in. I have nothing against a 14 minute song as long as it's all MUSIC. There's an extended &quot;Magic Bus&quot;, with a mini-sketch in the middle featuring Daltrey dickering with Townsend over the price of the bus--but not only is that section fairly entertaining in terms of Vaudeville, the rhythm section keeps chugging along underneath the dialogue in that signature Bo Diddley beat that's one of the song's most catchy aspects. At over half the duration of &quot;Generation&quot;, there isn't 1% of its potential for boredom in this track. And I guess I've saved the best for last--&quot;Young Man Blues&quot;, which I guess not even the Industry could resist--it made it to the old release as that version's opening track--reminds us in retrospect that this band had to have been a major influence on Grand Funk Railroad.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Rollin and My Generation are fair, but &quot;The One&quot; sounds so much like Re-Arranged it's ridiculous. Their other two albums are so much better. Don't listen to all the others who think they have to follow pop culture and immediatly give this album 5 stars and say &quot; LIMP BIZKIT ROCKS YO&quot; Try to listen to someone else's copy before you buy it yourself to see if you like it.
0792157869|5.0|Few sequals can live up the standards of their predocessor, (in this case there are two)  But INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE really does make you proud...of Spielberg, Ford, Lucas, Williams, the whole crew. I suppose this film holds special value to me since it was the only Indiana Jones film I had the pleasure of seeing on the big screen.  The story is excellent, just like the other two, the acting is impeccable, and I can't wait for the fourth one.  Our story opens with a flashback, starring the late River Peonex as Indy, for which we view three instances that make the indiana jones the man he is, and the man that became a hero.  First, we see where he gets his scar on his chin, his trademark whip, but most importantly, bringing us to the present, (1938) is when Indy recieves his felt fidora.  The Raiders March flurishes as this moment is reached in the film.  Classic.  Sean Connery is perfect for the role as indy's father, who else to be Indiana Jones' dad than James Bond himself?   The script is brilliant, the sets astounding, visuals spectacular, and the music score breath-taking.  Just like its older brothers, LAST CRUSADE hits it right on every element.  I can't say enough about these films.  The sound mix is excellent for a vhs.  Most entertaining is the fighter plane sequence, which zooms all arround the theatre.  The widescreen format is also beneficial.  So sit back, watch all three of these movies, and enjoy the greatest adventure films of all time.  HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!
0792833236|4.0|Such a good movie... the greatest tradgity of all time was when it lost the academy award to the Ordinary People in 1980.  This was the biggest tragedy of all time.  However, this film reminds me of this film, &quot;Two Lost Worlds (1950)&quot; Same sort of conflict Man versus Himself throughout this film.  The only reason why my rating was at 4 stars was because when I first purchased it the outer casing was slightly flawed.  Other than that it is very suitable and I watch it over and over again along with all of my favorite french films from the 50's.
079284632X|1.0|Any commercially released video of this Wes Craven classic is going to be a cut version. The so-called \\"uncut\\" Vestron issue wasn't uncut, and this new MGM version sure isn't. Whether there will ever be a definitive LAST HOUSE print is open to debate. As Michael Weldon wrote, \\"LAST HOUSE has been cut, recut, and had scenes replaced and removed so many times that stories about various legendary shocking scenes are hard to disprove.\\" Regardless, more complete prints are available; I'm not at liberty to say where, but do some looking on the web. No wonder this movie has gotten so many negative reviews here. People are judging it by seeing a watered-down version. Don't impulse-buy this (here or elsewhere) because you're surprised to finally see LAST HOUSE back on video. It ain't the real deal. [NOTE: This review applies to the VIDEOCASSETTE version, NOT the August 2002 DVD, which is reasonably complete.]
6305807043|5.0|The really wonderful movies - the ones you think about while you're going to sleep at night for years to come - are the ones that are met with a round of cheers mixed with a round of &quot;what the hell?&quot;s and &quot;I don't get it&quot;s.   &quot;2001&quot; met with that reception.  So did &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot;  So did &quot;Natural Born Killers.&quot;  So did &quot;Raging Bull.&quot;  So did &quot;Nixon.&quot;  So did &quot;Rushmore.&quot;  &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; now takes its rightful place among the greatest movies of all time.     This movie does everything right.  It's mind-bendingly original obviously.  It's blissfully entertaining from start to finish.  It's very funny - on many levels (Charlie Sheen's self-depricating cameo is a revelation).  And it's a wonderful drama.  As usual, John Cusak plays a hero who is sympathetic but also flawed and sometimes contemptible.      &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is a must buy.  It IS that good.
6305657947|2.0|I was disappointed in this movie because as it unfolded, I never cared about the characters. The robbery plot was well thought out but the only character development had to do with how money was not enough for either of them. The only resolution to this dilemma was still superficial at best. I normally like Pierce and Renee.
B00004U9WQ|5.0|About all the hype of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; being an adventurous film, it's funny to me that it doesn't come CLOSE to being as adventurous as &quot;Muzzy II&quot; (and the animation quality is much better too).  I've seen this movie at the theatre in 1999 and now I own the DVD.  Like Muzzy II there is a daring rescue required (Woody being kidnapped when his arm ripped) but it's only sort of like Amanda being kidnapped by Corvax and Thimbo.  This movie tells about Woody's life with Jessie and has new toys (Tour Guide Barbie, Mrs. Potato Head, etc.)
B00004XONN|5.0|As a Radiohead fan, I must say that on the first listen of this album, I was very disappointed. Even though I was expecting a different sound, I was like WHAT IS THIS? It wasn't until the third listen that I began to appreciate some of the songs individually. Optimistic, National Anthem, and How to Disappear Completely were the ones I kept coming back to. Then, I decided to give the whole album another chance. Then another, then another. Before long, I was repeatedly listening to the whole album without forcing myself to. I was enjoying it for what it is - an album as a whole. Songs that I considered ridiculous noise like Everything In It's Right Place and Idiotech became powerful singalongs to me. Before long, even the title track became infectious. And for those of you that skip over Treefingers - shame on you. As an individual song, it may not be my number one choice, but it fits into the album perfectly bridging the emptiness of How to Disappear with the Optimism of Optimistic. <br />Definitely the best album of 2000 so far and if it keeps growing on me like it has been, I might be calling it the best in the last 20 years!
B000000W5L|5.0|If I was stranded on an island for the rest of my life with only one album to listen to, Exile On Main Street would be my choice.  It gets better every listen, for years on end!  This is the Stones at their best -- a symphony of raw blues, soul and rock.  If you can't appreciate this album, you can't appreciate music.  Anyone trying to decide what Stones album they want to buy should start here.
B00004XOWM|5.0|When I first laid my hands on this album, I looked at the back. It immediately seemed very similar to their previous album, Significant Other. There were the Intro- and Outro-tracks, and at position 10 and 3 their already released singles Take A Look Around and My Generation. But don't ship off this album as simply a copy of their previous album, there is much more to this album than may seem at first.<br />Well, the album starts of with an intro, not very special. But then the second song 'Hot Dog' kicks in. This song is very aggressive, and the f-word is heard many times. I don't know many people who can express their anger in this way (without going to aimless screaming), Jonathan Davis form KoRn being another. After 'Hot Dog' the album continues with 'My Generation'. This song expresses the feeling of Fred's generation being blamed for all kinds of stuff. He replies to all their blames by telling them that he won't care, unless they start to care about them. I have to make a remark about 'Take A Look Around'. This song is just brilliant. They listened to the old Mission Impossible-theme, and gave the song a total work-over but in their own style. Seldom have I heard a remake of song being better than the original, but this is the case. The way the songs starts off is just excellent. To me, this song is the definite highlight on this album.<br />The album contains other highlights such as 'Full Nelson', 'The One'(one of the less up-tempo songs on this album) and 'It'll Be Okay'. <br />After listening to this album, I must say this album leaves me with a better feeling than Significant Other. Fred Durst' voice is really cool, and the bass-play is very neat. There are people who consider Limp Bizkit as just 'screaming noise', but I would recommend those people to listen to this album twice. They'll see that there is more to this album than they would have suspected.
B000000W5P|5.0|I love this album.  It is the Stones at their ironic best - mocking themselves and everyone else in a way that only Jagger and company can.  But what makes this album rise above so many other Stones albums is the inclusin of what I consider the best Stones song with Keith on lead vocals -- &quot;Before They Make Me Run.&quot;  Forget &quot;Happy,&quot; this song will get your rocks off.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Wow.<br />So I was eagerly waiting to get the new CD, after seeing Bizkit live and playing Significant Other so much that it wore out the cd.  I was looking for more hard hitting, angry intelligent Durst.<br />Too bad.<br />Instead of Other's pointed message and catchy tracks, CS&amp;THFW was full of pointless dribble (give me the microphone, let me throw down...) and the same bass line over and over.  Nothing to mix up the album, nothing new to throw out, nothing worthwhile.<br />It just seems like an attempt to suck all the $ possible out of their remaining 2 minutes of fame.  Look elsewhere for your angry rock fix.
6301008944|5.0|I discovered this movie when I was about twelve and my whole family loved it.  It was misadventure after misadventure, and definitely provided plenty of laughs.  I haven't seen it in quite a few years now, but I remember almost every word of it because I watched it so many times when I was younger.  It is one of the classics, in my humble opinion!<br />Every one is so spunky and loveable in this film, especially the red-haired kid whose favourite catchphrase is.  &quot;...Ya think?&quot;<br />I really reccommend this to families, (with kids over twelve).  The small amount of swearing and suggestive behaviour isn't enough to deter parents from letting their kids watch such an entertaining movie.  Well, I don't think it should be anyhoo.<br />The story is a real roller coaster ride, and a bit of a nail-biter, if like me, you tend to get caught up in the midst of things and forget that it's just a movie!  There is never a dull moment with this little gem.  Watch it, enjoy it and feel good, is all I'm trying to say.
B00004U30D|1.0|Without question, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Very slow paced, and only occasionally funny.  Want to waste two hours of your life?  Watch this film.
B00004XONN|5.0|I found this aulbum another amazing addition to all of Radiohead's aulbums.  Yeah, first listen gave me a headache, just like OK Computer,  but like OK Computer you have to give it time to settle in your mind.  Well I have listen to it about 20 times I can say the aulbum is extraordinary.  I don't know enough to say it's better than OK Computer, but the aulbum is everything.  Totally original and different for one thing,  don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  Only a band like Radiohead would jam a theatre with 8 Jazz musicians to create a such a random song such as &quot;The National Anthem&quot;.  There's a lot to the aulbum, the whole message of Kid A is a warning of the future, playing God and such.  It's art,  all the sounds create a really textured aulbum it's just fantastic and takes your breathe away sometimes.  Yeah it takes a while, but I'm sure I'm going to think this aulbum is twice as good by the 40th listen.  Don't buy the message that it's a piece of trash - it might sound random but it truly is art.  If you cried to OK Computer, you'll understand this aulbum.  You can almost feel the fear in the song &quot;Idioteque&quot; as Yorke yells, &quot;This is really happening&quot;.  Good music is relative, and this aulbum got me.
B00003CXFG|4.0|The unrated version of this movie only has an additional three minutes of footage, but it actually seems to have even less than that. There were basically just little segments throughout the movie that were extended by a few seconds, just to add that little bit more blood and gore. Didn't really add anything, nor did it take anything away. The extras consist of a couple commentary tracks, lame making of featurette, trailers, web links, etc. Not a lot, but my standards seem to be getting higher. The movie itself is a good sci-fi horror flick. I particularly love the opening sequence when the ship crashed on the planet. Those special effects were awesome. If you haven't seen this movie, I would rent the dvd before you buy it, just to make sure you like it, but if you like sci-fi this is a good film to add to your collection.
B00003CXB6|4.0|Having watched THE LOST WORLD again, I liked it better than I remembered from its theatrical run.  My only criteria for technically rating DVD's is picture quality and sound.  I think Universal has done a great job in both of these areas.  I hate it when studios use a bad print to make the DVD -- THE LOST WORLD looks crisp and the colors are fine.<br />The bonus stuff is pretty cool.  The storyboards and preproduction paintings are very attractive and very interesting.  The cut scenes are fun to see -- the more I watch cut scenes on DVDs, the more I realize WHY scenes get cut.  Included on THE LOST WORLD disc is a 3 minute scene of an IMAGIN Board Meeting where the members vote Hammond (Richard Attenborough) out of the company.  Yawn.  The plot point is handled in a later scene where, with one line (&quot;They're voting me out of the company&quot;), the information is relayed simply and quickly.  Movie-making is so interesting!<br />Anyway, like others have said, THE LOST WORLD is no JURASSIC PARK, but it is fun in its own ways.  The T-Rex and trailer-over-the-cliff action scene is a blast!<br />Enjoy the film, and have fun with all the DVD extras.
B00004WG4G|5.0|This film is like the perfect woman, it is physically beautiful and it's inteligence absolutly shines through also. You can't keep your eyes off it and you want more and more but the film knows how to pace it's audience well. Most films have some cool moments, this one has brilliant genius ones and the rest film is cool all the time. The themes are serious and adult-like, infedility, a broken marriage, family disfunction, death, hatred, pot smoking etc. but there is an almost child-like charm about it that hipnotizes, the same way that it's uncanny music sundtrack also does. <br />To tell you what the film's story is about would be defeating the same way it would be like telling you what &quot;Star Wars&quot; is about, both films transend their simple story lines and absolutly draw you into the character's universes.<br />In a few words, it's cinema at it's best. Magical.<br />Roberto Mena
B00000JCB2|1.0|this album sucks i would never buy it......i heard it at my friends house and i have their old album.......limp bizkit has to be THE worst band ever......fred durst is a complete idiot with an annoying voice who cant write lyrics.....i mean break stuff....if u want violence listen to cannibal corpse....this is an album full of pure crap on plastic the only reason id buy this is to break it
B00004X0M6|5.0|Laura's voice is amazing. It gets under your skin. Lyrics are beautiful and reminds you about love and friendship. Enjoy it!
B00004XOWM|4.0|This page is classic limp....they rock it hard and fast on this one
B00004XOWM|5.0|I'm a huge LB fan and could not wait to get my hand on this album.  This album is a new level for them (just as Fred Durst promised).  All the tacks rock.  If you are already a Bizkit fan you'll love this record.  If you started hating Limp after Significant Other, you'll hate them more.  However, if you dug Significan Other, this is the record for you, plus you might win one of the gold CDs and get backstage passes for life.
B00004XMTC|4.0|Out of the two un-official Bond movies (the other which is 'Casino Royale') Never Say Never Again is definetly a Bond movie to at least rent. Never Say Never Again has one of Sean Connery's last movies as Bond and is probally the longest Bond film yet. If you are truley dedicated to Bond and want to see a different &quot;style&quot; to the Bond movies; Never Say Never Again is the movie for you. But if you want to stick to the official movies that have the same Bond &quot;old school&quot; style; Never Say Never Again will only be a rental then..
0679879269|3.0|This third book in the His Dark Materials sequence is not quite as satisfying as the first two.  While waiting for this book to come out, I heard bookstore rumors that Pullman was somehow &quot;stuck&quot; and having trouble making progress on this book.  As a writer, I can certainly understand that. I understand it especially well, now that I am reading the book and finding it has an oddly disconnected feel, as if it were too widely flung, too disparate in all the elements it tries to bring together.  Something is missing at the heart of this book that was there in the earlier ones. Perhaps there are simply too many worlds to keep track of in this book. You don't feel you are sucked into the book the way you did with The Golden Compass.  Still, it's a very enjoyable read.
6304346107|4.0|This version of Emma is wonderful.  It stays true to the original story completely, and a movie based on a Jane Austen novel must do that to be any good.  Emma is the daughter of a wealthy man in good social status in the small town of Highbury.  In the beginning her governess( Miss Taylor) is getting married to a  man of great social stature.  Emma had played matchmaker and considers the wedding her own achievement.  Her friend Mr. Nightly tells her she simply made a lucky guess and nothing more.  However her mind does not change and she is determined to find (the minister) Mr. Elton a bride as well.  Her mind is made up when she meets sweet simple Miss Harriet Smith the natural daughter of someone and not that respectable.  Once she and Harriet become friends, Harriet is proposed to by a farmer(from Mr. Nightly's estate)named Robert Martin.  Emma convinces Harriet to refuse him because her is below her station.  Nightly tells her she has not done her friend a service.  Harriet is later rejected by Mr. Elton because he loves Emma.  When Emma finds out she is shocked, and tells off Mr. Elton who storms away.  He later marries a woman named Augusta for her money.  Harriet eventually marries Robert Martin.  Emma likes a man named Frank Churchill for a while ,but he was secretly betrothed to another girl(Jane Fairfax).  Then she realises that the man for her is Nightly and marries him to live happily ever after.  And we hope never to make another match.
0780622553|4.0|Seeing this masterful and imaginative dark odyssey on DVD has reminded me how completely the makers of THE MATRIX are indebted to Alex Proyas's earlier vision:  in both films, the hero an unaware messiah figure who needs the help of outsiders to awaken him to his own true powers; the human race is held captive by hidden aliens who seek to control our very sense of reality; the telekinetic rebel is seeking a lost (perhaps imaginary) human paradise (&quot;Zion&quot; or &quot;Shell Beach&quot;), etc. etc.  DARK CITY was there first, and the film is a small masterpiece of completely self-contained noir fantasy, brilliantly done.
B00004XOWM|5.0|I tell ya, I never was a big fan of Limp.  I'm a NIN boy and was quite angry with Fred and Trents little battle.  I never would have expected to fall in love with this cd.  I had heard some samples of it online and ran right out and bought it.  This cd shows how much the Bizket has grown up and their music has matured.  On this cd they dive into a dark type rap metal with Tool like guitar attacks and beats, just listen to Boiler and you'll know what I mean.  I also give Fred alot of credit for basically takin on every artist that has ever said a word about him.  I also felt a little bit better when I found out he got permission to slay Reznors lyrics, I just wish they couls patch things up.  This record also has a a NIN feel, it shows what an influence Nails is on Limp.  I advise you to go pick up this cd, its an awesome party cd to real pumped up awesome hooks to.  Definatly the best Limp Bizket cd released
B000002UVX|4.0|I have a question for all the Hendrix nuts out there...on the original CD of BOG, at approximately 3:50 or so into the song &quot;Power of Love/Soul&quot;, it sounds like there's a &quot;break&quot;, like the tape stopped and they had to patch it (it's where Jimi starts singing after the instrumental break). Has this been &quot;fixed&quot; in the remastered version, or is it the same?
630382790X|5.0|I've spent the last few days reading Tom Clancy's new novel &quot;The Bear and the Dragon&quot;, and I can't think of a worse example of all that's horrible about ultra-conservative US politics. It was racist, xenophobic dribble, that I found deeply offensive. Especially since I'm an Australian-born person of Asian descent.<br />So today I decided to borrow Apollo 13...again. And re-discovered one of my favourite aspects of America, that Americans themselves seemed to have disowned or simply forgotten - their Space Program.<br />Apollo 13 is a fantastic showcase that shows what people (and in particular the brilliant people at NASA) are capable of under the most terrifying, horrifying circumstances imaginable. I'm actually planning to buy the novel on which the movie is based, I was so inspired and moved by what I saw.<br />The acting, cinematography and direction in this film are absolutely faultless. I liked Tom Hanks performance in this film a lot better than Forrest Gump...which is quite amazing when you consider just how brilliant a film Forrest Gump was. OK, I guess like Hanks I'm a huge admirer of the NASA space program, so maybe I'm biased.<br />But being a musician, my favourite aspect of the entire film is James Horner's magnificent, brilliant, classical score. Let's face it, would Star Wars have been as successful a movie as it was without John Williams? Would Star Trek have continued as long as it had without Jerry Goldsmith or Alexander Courage? Horner's score is unashamedly patriotic, but in a way that a person from ANY country could empathise with. And there's such a poignant wistfulness and romance about this music that breaks my heart.<br />In the end, Apollo 13 (the film) showcases a part of human history that everyone should be drawing more inspiration from. We all dared to dream that humans could travel to the moon and back...and succeeded. NASA (and the US) became a shining example to the rest of the world, and showed what humans are truly capable of. And now the whole world has forgotten...or taken it for granted. <br />Buy this movie, don't just rent it. It's a classic and my number one favourite movie of all time.
0446310786|4.0|I really like the theme of this piece.   I learned that people really are good once one gets to know them.  I liked this book, because it really doesn't leave one hanging as some books do.  I had to write four reports on this book; I thought it was easy because the book is very interesting so I really didn't mind reading it.  I started to read the book even before it was required.  This book is good, but I did think that it didn't make sense at the beginning when I frist started reading it.
B000002UB6|5.0|This is one of the Beatles best albums, if not the best.  Underrated, it was the only Beatles album to get negative and harsh reviews. Although it was #1 on Billboard, it sold poorly compared to their previous efforts.  Let it Be boasted three number one singles: the title track, Get Back, and The Long and Winding Road.  The Long and Winding Road is A particularly beautiful song, with the strings, piano, and the female chorusLet it Be has always been a favorite song of mine, not just by the Beatles, but by any group.  If you really look at it, it was more of a mature album.  Ironically, the #1 album on Billboard before this album was Paul McCartney's first solo album.  This album should not be overlooked.  Listen to it for yourself.
B00004RJ74|5.0|when i picked this DVD up at my local wal-mart i noticed that it was a little heavy, when i got home i found out that there are 2 DVD's in the package, which i was supprised.  the first Disc has the movie &quot;full Tilt Boogie&quot; which was an awsome behind the scenes look at what was going on during filming. <br />     the Sceond disc has the movie itself plus tons of extras!  the commentary was pretty cool (quentin was so excited 'cause it's his first commentary) the hollywood goes to hell behind the scenes was pretty much the same as full tilt boogie, but it did have some extra stuff that boogie did'nt have.  if you don't have from dusk till dawn on DVD get this version, but if you do have it on DVD, rent this version.
B000002UB3|4.0|This album is one of the Beatles' best efforts.  Every member of the band made a contribution.  The best songs are &quot;Something&quot;, &quot;Octopuses Garden&quot;, &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and &quot;Come Together&quot;.  However, I thought the suite weakened the album a bit.  If it wasn't for that, i would have given the album five stars.  Still, John, Paul, George, and Ringo created a milestone in pop rock.  This is a great album: GET IT!!
B00003CX95|5.0|so many people said watch this movie!! i had heard of it and actually rented it 2 times with the intention of watching it, but when i looked at the 2 tapes sitting on my table flashbacks of titanic played in my mind (soooooo long!!) so finally a friend had it on DVD and we watched it one day.<br />    i was very impressed with the amazing story line and the excellent battle scenes.  the commentary with actor/producer/director mel gibson was really cool, but i was hoping for more bonus items, but with a awsome story, i was glad to have finally seen it
0684800713|5.0|As with all wars, World War I ended with more than just a calamitous death toll of circa 40 million. Since most breadwinners were either killed or maimed in the war, many families were forced to face the devastation of loss on their own.  Compounding this tragedy was the loss of irreplaceable manpower.  Economic costs, caused by the destructive forces of the war, ran into trillions of dollars, bringing countries like France and England to their knees.  <br />A spirit of doom, despair and disillusionment pervaded the world.   Old ideologies seemed to mock the reality of the times and the youth who had lived through the war had abandoned them in exchange for a more licentious lifestyle.    This was a time when writers like Hemingway and Fitzgerald began to express a sense of lost direction in their writing, producing such timeless masterpieces as:  &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, by F. Scott Fitzgerald and , by Ernest Hemingway.  Published in 1926, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; established Hemingway as the \\"big man in American letters\\" as Allan Tate wrote.  It is the story of American and British expatriates living in post World War I Paris, which gives a vivid description of hopeless love and unconstrained behavior.  Battling against creative dry-spells and depression, Robert Cohn and his friend, Jake Barnes, mingle with large crowds of fellow expatriates. These single \\"thirtysomethings\\" represented the \\"lost generation\\", the youth that had emerged from the war disillusioned and directionless, living by the bottle and the temporary euphoria it provided.  <br />Drifting from the left bank of Paris and the colorful, lively clubs that dotted its landscape, to the savage excitement of the bullfighting in Spain, these young men and women desperately sought to find a connection.  Whether through their friendships, or through their failed attempts at love, theirs was a struggle to beat back loneliness; to fill the void the war had gouged in their souls. But they did sowith laughter, idle talk and a bottle of good wine.  Days were spent walking up the Rue du Cardinal in Paris looking for a good place to eat, or fishing for trout up in Burguete, Spain, dreaming all the while of unrealized love.<br /> Hemingway's seven-year stay in Paris had no doubt contributed to the realistic, picturesque account of France in the 1920's.  There, he hooked up with a group of writers and other artists in a circle known as \\"the lost generation\\", which he creatively and credibly reproduced in his novel.  He also spent much of his time in Pamplona, Spain watching, and sometimes participating in, bullfighting competitions.    However, it was Hemingway's own semi-tragic involvement in World War I, which nearly cost him his leg, that gave the novel its soul.  Through his own experiences, Hemingway successfully fused the gap between reality and art, and offered his readers a timeless masterpiece.
B000031WD9|4.0|i thought this version did'nt differ much from the r rated version, but the extras boosted this rating from 3 stars to 4.  i did like the extras and the audio commentry, the outakes and the hidden music video (see if you can find it) the movie itself is a good coming of age movie, but some people might find it a little offensive.

6305311463|5.0|this was a very good purchase. i thought about buying the regular version 'cause it was cheeper, but i'm glad i went with this version.  the second disk has some good stuff, but i thought it was a little short.  the audio commentry is the best thing about the first disc.  hearing ben affleck  doing an impression of billy bob thorton from &quot;sling blade&quot; had me rolling!! the unrated footage was pretty cool, also. if you liked the movie and want to find more about it, this is the best way to go.
B00004X01U|2.0|In my opinion, this album certainly lacks depth. It sounds like the woman has not matured. The lyrics are surprisingly empty and cliched in most songs. Some parts are catchy (Music, Impressive Instant, Paradise -- how lovely to hear her speak French, my mother tongue), but not enough to make me listen to the songs over and over again like I usually do with Madonna's music. Even when I first heard &quot;Music&quot; on the radio I was suprised it was actually made by Madonna. Could have been made by Britney or some other teenagers.  The album leaves me with a strange feeling.
B00000K3UU|4.0|being a kind of adam sandler fan, i automatcally  wanted to see this movie.  when i finally got a chance to see this on dvd, i was plesenty supprised.  although, this is a little tamer than i'm used to, this was a great  movie to add to my collection.<br />     Plus, if your gonna watch a adam sandler movie with your kids, this is the best one, it's not to harsh and has a good story line.  the extra content is ok, the 2 music videos are pretty cool.  overall, it's a good teen family movie.
0140131558|4.0|Whatever you might think that the anti-detective novel The New York Trilogy is about it ultimately boils down to love. The love of writing, the problem of authorship and last but not the least the love of a woman. In the three novels the narrator shifts in character. First he is Quinn working under the alias of his fictional character Work who presumes the identity of Paul Auster the detective who in turn .. I think you get my drift. What do all theese characters have in common? They are all trying to describe the world in words. They all fale it seems. All but one, the last character in the last book, the nameless narrator succedes. Why? Because of the love of a woman (Sophie - the &quot;madonna&quot;) who teaches the authors alias that writing is secondary to love, the keystone in life.
B00004STDN|4.0|i think the extra features of this DVD save it from being a 3 star movie.  this is a good &quot;basic&quot; action movie where silvester stallone plays a mountian climber who battles it out with bad guys on a mountain.  the plot is ok, and the acting could be better, but it's a good 2 hour time killer.<br />     the extra features are the best part of the disc and really was the main reason why i bought the DVD.  the commentary is cool (although stallone isn't on there much) and the deleted scenes are pretty cool.
0399146253|3.0|I'm a big fan of Cornwell so she gets the 3 stars for her ability to write. This book, however, does nothing to enrich the series. It is basically a long, drawn out therapy session in which Kay discovers and embraces her demons. To be honest I found myself wondering why I paid for the book when she should have paid me for listening. NOVELIST, HEAL THYSELF!!<br /> The characters of Kathy Reichs (Tempe Brennan) and Robert Walker (Jessica Coran) still deliver the goods. Spend your money there!
0790731479|5.0|this movie has been one of my favorites for a long time!! the DVD gives great sound and picture!  <br />a must buy if you like funny horror movies!
0684171600|5.0|I missed reading Treasure Island as a child, but I'm happy to write that I enjoyed it thoroughly as an adult.  The plot is simple yet entertaining, and moves at a rapid pace despite Stevenson's vivid descriptions and well-developed characters.<br />This particular edition, by the way, is beautifully bound, with stunning illustrations and rugged, high-quality paper.
B00001PE4D|4.0|WOW!! i liked this movie alot the DVD has some good extras and the movie itself is worth the purchase of the DVD.<br />     This movie is about a brother and sister who are bored with normal life, and using their money and power, try something much more mean: destroying a young gir's life.<br />     the DVD has lots of extras including 2 music videos, some deleted scenes, and more.  it's a great movie to add to your collection.
0679879269|5.0|This conclusion to His Dark Materials is better than the first two, a befitting climax to the trilogy, and both heart-warming, tragic, and bittersweet.  I reccomend everyone to read this story, and the two proceeding it, as it one of the most well-written books I have read.
0780631684|5.0|Since it's around Halloween time (as i write this it's 10 days before halloween) this is a pretty cool movie to see for halloween!  the movie is about this guy who gets on a plane with friends and classmates from his french class, but has a horrible dream that the plane will blow up.  he gets into a fight and gets kicked off the plane, which after takeoff, blows up.  the rest of the movie is great, and i thought the picture quality and sound are also excellent.  the story was pretty cool, and i really liked the fact that the killer is more of a feeling than some guy running around with a mask.<br />     The extra features are great! there are some games where you calculate the time where you will die, and another where you try to see how good your psychic powers are.  i love the commentary with the actors (they crack jokes through the whole movie!!) if you like teen thrillers, get this movie!
0553106635|5.0|The problem with fantasy authors these days is that when they write, they set out to write good fantasy. When George R.R. Martin writes, he sets out good literature. What he ends up with is what we've all enjoyed these past four years, excellent quality literature that makes you better for having read it.<br />This series is for an emotionally balanced person. That is, one who can appreciate as well as endure the entire spectrum of emotions. One who is not too dependent upon the good feelings and are vulnerable to the bitter ones. For it is a bittersweet story, filled with despair and hope, grief and joy. All of it good to the very last drop.<br />This series is also not for the squeamish little girls in you. Violence is as real and horrid as it should be. Sex is not overlooked either. Some may find fault in the inclusion of these elements but I assure you that they are not for gratuity's sake. They have purpose, to set the tone for the entire series. They are to make you uncomfortable, for comfort dulls the senses.<br />So that you do not get any misconceptions, this series is not entirely bleak or monotonously disturbing. There is much wonder and mystique, and a sense of romance. It is a well balanced series, with a grim serious tone to it. That very tone however, serves to heighten the aura of magic about the whole series.<br />And lastly, while this series is grim and solemn, it won't damage your psyche or make you a cynical and jaded person. Its entertainment value is still quite high, but not at the cost of its intellectual value. It's a fun read for those with sophisticated taste in epic fantasy. Having said that, beginners to the genre will find it hard to read. There are lighter novels and series which are easier to digest and get into. For those who are disillusioned fantasy grognards, this series will turn you into babbling fools again. For those buying book after book from Jordan or Goodkind, you may be ready to graduate to a higher level of fantasy andbroaden your horizons.<br />If all of this has not convinced you yet, consider this. This series is one of the few, if not the only series to have gotten better with each installment. That's hard to say of very many other series...hint hint.
0684853523|4.0|Wow.  It's probably not, in retrospect, too difficult to make the idea of a rabid St. Bernard or a possessed car seem at least mildly interesting, but you know the writer's talented when even a segment about the perils of adverbs is funny, exciting and can't-put-it-down material.<br />Hopefully this book will bring to King some of the respect he's long deserved.  While I haven't loved all of his books equally, I've always felt that King was underrated as a writer, so I really loved this book not only for its honesty and optimism, but also because it is (again) a sterling example of why this guy sells a zillion books a year.  As usual, King's deceptively easy and conversational tone (even in a book about writing) makes the story a hard one to put down.<br />King offers something for everyone in &quot;On Writing.&quot;  Whether you're a fan of his books and simply want to hear more about the mind behind the art, or are an aspiring writer looking to pick up a few tips, this book's worth the purchase price.  King not only gives fascinating glimpses of his own past (and I thought my babysitters were bad), but also offers professional, hard-nosed advice on the art of writing, and how to succeed if you're really willing to buckle down and get to the tough stuff.  And even when discussing the dangers of adverbs or the harsh realities of the profession, King is gently supportive of his readers' ambitions, and reminds us that the writing really is supposed to be part of the reward.<br />The book ends with a segment that's worth the purchase price alone -- a fascinating and sometimes horrifying account of King's own brush with death last year.  The fact that he makes even this material amusing says a lot about King in general (it suddenly occurs to King, lying mangled by the roadside as he chats with the genial, slow-talking guy who hit him, that he's been hit &quot;by a character from one of my own books&quot;). Fascinating no matter what your reasons for buying, and well worth a read.th a read.
0671646788|4.0|This book opened the door to a whole new way of thinking for me.  It shone a light on possibilities I hadn't known were there.  And it changed the direction of my life.  ...And yet I wrestled with some reservations while I was reading it, and still have reservations - some parts were too simplistic.  But overall, it's engaging and worthwhile and I still refer back to it for inspiration.
B00004XPQM|4.0|Hmmm, I fail to see how this movie was &quot;that bad&quot;, i actually liked it and do not see why wanna be critic's and critic's alike think only movies such as &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; can only achieve high ratings.  This movie was quite suspenceful, and not even the best of avid movie go-ers could guess the final destination of the actors in this film, who are no Tom Hank's or Sally Field's, but they get the job done and diliver a good over-all performance.  So if you want another good friday night fright film for your collection or just like the suspence and thrill of guessing someones final destination, check this film out, you wont be dissapointed and will probably watch it again.
B000001ESP|2.0|Whereas in previous RUSH albums the listener is challenged to ponder a young mans new found individuality and his struggle in a socialist state, or the inner struggle between reason and emotion and it's ultimate resolution as told from the prospective of various Greek gods, in Moving Pictures we are treated to songs about driving a car or being a famous rock band. All but gone are the themes of history, politics, and poetry. Soaring epilogs from the past such as \\"I see the works of gifted hands that grace this strange and wondrous land. I see the heads of men arise with hungry minds and open eyes.\\" or \\"Let the truth of love be lighted, let the love of truth shine clear. Sensibility, armed with sense and liberty, with a heart and mind united in a single perfect sphere.\\", have been replaced with moving refrains such as \\"My uncle has a country place that no one knows about. He says it used to a farm before the motor law.\\"     Not only are the intelligent lyrics and verbal mastery missing here, the music suffers as well. YYZ comes off like three talented musicians showing how well they can play rather than any real attempt at making a great piece of music.    Moving Pictures is indeed a landmark album. Marking the departure of one the most intelligent, gifted bands ever assembled. Replaced by a band that packages songs for radio play and the masses. Listening to this album one would have to assume that \\"living in the limelight\\" was not just the universal dream, but RUSH's dream as well.
0792846710|5.0|This movie scared the crap out of me when I was little. Now, years later, it isn't as scary but now it's funny. I know that sounds weird. Anyway, I recomend this to anyone, it still is one of my favorite movies. I really would like to see it on dvd or see a sequel!
B00000JJM2|5.0|&quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; is an okay movie, but the soundtrack is awesome!  The songs &quot;Be my Baby&quot;, &quot;Hungry Eyes&quot;, and &quot;She's like the Wind&quot;  are my favorites.  They are great to listen to if you're having  a bad day.  If you want to buy a great CD, I recommend buying  this one. It's fabulous!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|My family greatly enjoyed this simple and heartwarming movie.  It isn't often you can sit down and watch a movie as a whole family in today's world.  This is a wonderful story of love for family and finding a way to heal old wounds without lengthy and wasteful dialog.  It is amazing that this movie was made in today's hollywood where sex, violence, and car chases take precidence over a great story line. Richard Farnsworth is magical and shows us what acting is all about.
B000002IJL|5.0|It is a great movie, which makes it a great soundtrack.  When I can't watch the movie, I just listen to the soundtrack and I get reminded of how great the movie is.
0783228317|5.0|This movie can best be described as weird, in a good way. It starts out funnier than anything I've ever seen, then takes a right turn into freaky, but still manages to remain funny. Most people won't get it, and it will be dismissed as a movie that started out funny, then it took the drugs that were in the suitcase, and became freakier than hell. Or maybe not, all I know is I loved it.<br />&quot;You people voted for Hubert Humphrey - and you killed Jesus!&quot;  Watch the movie, if only to hear that one line.
B000002TP7|5.0|I have to say that any serious hip hop beat freak will dig the funk on this album. Their earlier stuff is a little too frat boy dorm room let's get some chicks in our 'dope' party-ish sound. But this album shows some serious thought processes at work and some heavy philosophies at play. The beats are tight and the rhymes are strong, with more conviction than before and frankly this album is incredibly inventive and original in many ways. They are really exploring on this album and it's all good. The beats man. The beats are cruel, man. The theme of ill communication is also nice, with their voices muddied and fuzzed out. Some serious conceptualizing. deep. This album is a classic in all respects.
0684853523|5.0|I am not a writer and I don't have aspirations to be one.  I read books on writing to enhance my enjoyment of reading.  I've read &quot;Bird By Bird&quot; and all of Lawrence Block's books on writing.  Mr. King's &quot;On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft&quot; is one that any lover of fiction can enjoy.  I read it as an &quot;airplane book&quot; last weekend and found myself smiling and chuckling out loud at many passages.  Mr. King's book will doubtless be assigned as a text in writing classes (or, maybe not, considering his opinion of such classes).<br />Also, you needn't be a well read fan of Stephen King to appreciate this book.  He makes references to examples of good and bad writing outside his own works.  His use of humor to emphasize his points is appropriate and well placed.  <br />I had a writing instructor in college (required class) who taught that fictional writing would ruin the reading experience. Since I love to read, I was grateful to &quot;hear&quot; Mr. King say, &quot;If you don't have the time to read, you don't have the time or the tools to write.&quot;  This book enables the reader to read with greater knowledge of the craft and the writer to continue enjoy reading, and both will gain more from the experience.
B00003CX95|5.0|Between the sensational acting, the astounding costumes and effects Braveheart is a historical saga not to be missed. Mel Gibson plays a reblious Scottsman fighting for freedom from England. The king a merciless ruler with a feeble son is heading straight for death without and aire. Sophie Marceau portrays a princess who falls in eternal love with Gibson, a role that did not quite fit her but she made the best out of a flaw. Braveheart is undoubtablely Mel Gibon's best work ever. A few historical flaws here and there, but otherwise a perfect must see movie of the year.

B00004X0Q0|5.0|ATD-I's first album proper for a major label is a fantastic effort, everything that punk should be, angry, visceral,imaginative, and downright entertaining. This isn't the kind of punk that floods MTV these days. It's about as far removed from bands like Greenday and Blink 182 as you could conceivably get.<br />The energy flowiing through this album is almost tangible. Each one of the songs is like a miniature atomic bomb. To borrow an album title, it's like a 'Tactical Neural Implant'. Intelligent, angry and unpredictable. This is the best punk album this year.<br />My personal favourite songs are the single One Armed Scissor, Invalid Letter Dept.(with it's refrain of &quot;dancing on the corpses ashes&quot; and a destructive riff nearing the end of the song).<br />If you want to experience the real alternative and true punk scene at the moment, then get out there and buy this. It's damn worth it.
B00004XOWM|4.0|When I went out to get ''Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water'' I had high expectations, since ''Three Dollar Bill Y'all'' and ''Significant Other'' were really good I expected good stuff, and this album is nothing but good music. Although I say you have to be a rock fan to understand this album if you're not a rock fan don't buy this album because this is really an album for rock fans or Limp fans. But still this album is very good, the guys of Limp Bizkit have just put out their best album yet.
0399146253|1.0|This book is really Black Notice Part II.  The question is, did Black Notice need a part II?  First of all, forget all that promotional talk about Jamestown and a 400 year old mystery.  Cornwell obviously had an idea for a book then changed her mind and went in a totally different direction.  I wish she hadn't.  First, you have to wade through excruciatingly boring psychobabble with Kay's friend Dr. Zenner (the real mystery here is why Kay forgets Zenner was her shrink in earlier books but denies it here --  besides the fact that the weak setup of Kay for murder required it).  I nearly didn't make it past that part, which is a full third of the book.  Second, the book is low on action.  An enormous part of the book either replays old scenes -- we relive the Loup Garou attacks, Bray's murder, etc. -- or has Kay watching other's actions, like a long section where Kay watches a videotape of the werewolf being interviewed by someone else.  All of which leaves very little new and real action for Kay.  Then there is the ending, which is absurd.  Without giving anything away, let's just say when you stop to think about it all, you know it could and would never happen.  In addition, Cornwell seemed compelled to tie in her last few books.  Just about everything gets answered here, including things you never asked.  It just adds to the dopey ending.  On a down note, Marino does nothing but get drunk and act foul.  I can't recall if he had a single police action to perform.  Lucy becomes an even more unbelievable and unlikable superwoman, if you can believe that.  On the upside, I still like Kay, even though she's only a shadow of the wonderful character first introduced over a decade ago.  And Cornwell has good pacing.  Even when scoffing I had no trouble turning the pages, once out of the Zenner psychobabble, as I do with her non-Scarpetta books.  And Jaimie Berger, the Linda Fairstein-ish ADA from NYC, is wonderful.  Gee, maybe Cornwell can start a new series with Berger.
B000002UAO|4.0|This was my all time favorite beatles album. I spent most of my life listening to my dad's record of it. Here is something I think everyone should know: any version you buy of this album now will not be the origional version. Listen closely: drive my car REALLY doesn't belong on the album. And there's others too. What can I say, it really makes me mad. So, thats why the four stars. Its a great album...just those damn record companies...
0395645662|5.0|This book will become a classic among the many wonderful novels about the potential for counter-utopias (creating the opposite of a better life for humanity), and deserves far more than five stars.  I found it as interesting and rewarding as 1984, Brave New World, and Atlas Shrugged.<br />Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills. With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.<br />To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. The Giver was one of her picks.  She said, &quot;It's an awesome book, Dad, and it will only take you an hour to reread.&quot;  My wife then chimed in and said I really should review this book for Amazon.com.  So here it is.<br />Ms. Lowry paints a bleak picture of having achieved equal lives for all.  Everyone gets the same things, and interactions are modulated so that there will be a minimum of social disorder.  Think of this as socialism turned into a low-security prison camp operated by the inmates with the help of drugs to keep everyone's minds and emotions numb.<br />The book evolves through the life of Jonas, a 12 year old, who has lived this life of great civility and little intensity up until the book's beginning.  Then he goes through a great ritual in which each young person begins specific training for their life's work, as determined by the collective to best fit their skills and personalities.<br />Jonas is to have a role that he did not even know existed.  He is to be the one person in the society who will have memories of what occurred before the collective state was formed.  His tutor will be the man who has had this role until now.  That man is the Giver.  I won't tell you any more, because I don't want to spoil the story.  The rest proceeds much like what would occur with a hero in an Ayn Rand novel.  The resolution of the conflict is a particularly inventive and thought-provoking one.<br />This book is particularly good for showing the dangers of having everyone think alike.  I heartily endorse its message of exploring new thoughts and experiences.  Those provide us with greater comfort than a grey conformity that we do not even perceive as such.<br />After you have finished enjoying this outstanding book, I suggest that you ask yourself what rules your family has that could be creating missed opportunities to be more caring and close to one another.  After you locate those rules, I suggest you have a discussion about the benefits of changing those rules.  Good luck!<br />May you find warmth and love wherever you go!!e was formed.

6302725534|4.0|If you want the story the way it is presented on the stage, this is not the version for you.  You will need to get the new Disney version with Kathy Bates.<br />This film is NOTHING like the Broadway show, its an entirely different animal.  Aileen Quinn stars as Annie, with Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan, Bernadette Peters as Lily St Regis, Ann Reinking as Grace Farrell, Albert Finney as Warbucks and Tim Curry as Rooster.<br />The director, John Huston, has turned the show into a huge, bellowing blockbuster, with huge fanfares and leaping dancers. The show is really a simple tale of a girl in search of her parents, and who finds a home in the arms of a millionaire.<br />The climax, with Annie dangling over a bridge thing, is completely unrealistic.<br />Also, there is no real romance between Grace and Warbucks on stage, and yet here we are led to believe that by the end they are...!<br />But, if you want Annie on hormones, buy this by all means, but buy the Disney version too for the real telling of the tale.
B00000DFSK|4.0|This record has the essentials for the non-hardcore fan of U2 in the 1980s.  The only singles that are truly missed are &quot;Gloria&quot; from 'October', &quot;Two Hearts Beat As One&quot; from 'War', and &quot;In God's Country&quot; from 'The Joshua Tree'; but for the sake of fitting everything on one CD, the choices of tunes in this collection are well-calculated.  Also, a fan merely looking for a best of collection will probably not be phased by the fact that some of the songs appear here in an edited version (&quot;New Years' Day&quot; and &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;) or that a superior live version of a track has been overlooked (compare the version of &quot;Bad&quot; on here with the version on 'Wide Awake in America').<br />For those who want to expand their 80s-era U2 collections beyond the &quot;Best of&quot;, I recommend (in order of quality):  (1) 'The Joshua Tree'; (2) 'War'; (3) 'Rattle &amp; Hum'; and (4) 'The Unforgettable Fire'.
B000031XCR|4.0|I remember being abroad @ school in France in '93 and coming across this French-Canadian singer who was all the rage at the time.  Her voice was so beautiful that I bought one of her CD's, even though I barely spoke a word of French.<br />Fortunately, she was discovered by a larger audience and broke into English-singing CD's, and what an amazing career she's had since.  I, too, was disappointed that some of her earlier hits were not included, but overall this is a very strong set of some of the most widely-purchased pop music of the last decade.<br />Her new songs are beautiful, too - the cover of &quot;The First Time..&quot; is absolutely hauntingly beautiful.  She's obviously learned that her voice has power, but that there's equal beauty when she scales it back and just lets the music take her where it will.  I'm over the &quot;duets with dead people&quot; so &quot;All the Way&quot; was a non-event for me.<br />A definite must-have for any and all Celine fans, but don't miss her earlier work - which is great, but under-represented on this set.
B000001FS6|4.0|U2 were completely panned by the press and some hardcore U2 fans for 'Rattle & Hum' (1988), which is purported to be U2's ill-fated egocentric exploration into American music.  Leaving pretentiousness in the eyes of the beholder, a lot of people liked this record, a mix of studio songs and live tracks from 'The Joshua Tree' tour and for good reason.  Here's a song-by-song:<br />1. \\"Helter Skelter\\" [Live].  OK, the ego does get a bit out of hand here, but this is one of the standout cover tunes.<br />2. \\"Van Diemen's Land\\".  The Edge takes vocals on this nice ode to the working man which is abruptly cut off in mid-verse.<br />3. \\"Desire\\".  The first single, an obvious musical tribute to blues legend Bo Diddley, continues to be one of their most popular and infectious songs.<br />4. \\"Hawkmoon 269\\".  Although there is some lyrical help from Bob Dylan, this is one of the studio tracks that really does not work.<br />5. \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" [Live].  An uninspired cover which is memorable only if you saw the movie.<br />6. \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" [Live].  With embellishments by a real gospel choir, the song is performed the way it was meant to be.<br />7. \\"Freedom for My People\\".  This is just a snippet of a street performer.<br />8. \\"Silver and Gold\\" [Live].  A great live version of a non-LP track, seethingly delivered by Bono toward an apathetic American audience.<br />9. \\"Pride (in the Name of Love)\\" [Live].  What live record would be complete without the consumate U2 anthem.<br />10. \\"Angel of Harlem\\".  As one of the songs recorded at the historic Sun Studios, complete with a horn section, this lyrical ode to Billie Holiday is a U2 classic.<br />11. \\"Love Rescue Me\\".  With the accompanyment of Bob Dylan, this one never really picks up.<br />12. \\"When Love Comes to Town\\".  Although many U2 fans did not appreciate the prominent vocals and guitar of B.B. King, the lyrics are \\"fantastic\\" (as the King puts it in the movie), and if you love the blues . . . <br />13. \\"Heartland\\".  You can almost see the Mississippi going by on this song, a mood piece which works much better than \\"Love Rescue Me\\".<br />14. \\"God Part II\\".  A great rocker about contradiction and a lyrical and musical prequel to U2's \\"reinvention\\" in the 1990s.<br />15. \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" [Live].  With a recorded intro of Jimi Hendrix doing \\"Star Spangled Banner\\", this is the consumate version of this song.<br />16. \\"All I Want Is You\\".  Although it seems a bit out of place on this record, this is simply one of the best U2 ballads ever.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Another great CD from Savage Garden.<br />Affirmation is truly one of the most positive songs I've ever heard, in a non-We Are the World-way.  A permanent fixture on every workout CD I've burned since this album came out.<br />I don't think I need to go into a song-by-song as my rating speaks for itself.. the only song I didn't care for was &quot;I Knew I Loved You ...&quot;  I think it was the range of the song vs. the range of the voice behind it - not a great match.<br />Other than that - don't listen to the words about it being depressing.  Truly good CD's have songs that can play to whatever emotion you may be feeling at the moment.. those of us with a pulse feel many, so a diverse CD such as this one is a great soundtrack for everyday life. :)
B000001E18|3.0|If you did not like 'Achtung Baby' (1991) or 'Pop' (1997), then 'Zooropa' (1993), which was put together in a short period of time during the ZooTV tour, is definitely not for you.  A message to those early-U2 fans (on this, the eve of the release of their second 'Best of 1990-2000') if you thought U2's approach to the 1990s was a sin, then they are definitely going to hell for 'Zooropa'.  Here is a song-by-song review:<br />1. \\"Zooropa\\".  If you want to pigeon-hole this album, it could best be described as art rock, as producer Brian Eno's influence has never been more pronounced.  The title-track magnum opus, with its three different moods, is a perfect example.<br />2. \\"Babyface\\".  Lyrically playing on the theme of TV being \\"better than the real thing\\", this song is a bit of pop fluff that may have best been left as a b-side.<br />3. \\"Numb\\".  This is definitely U2 at their most experimental, with Edge's monotone lead chant and Bono's newly-found falsetto playing prominent roles.  Whether you like the song or not, you have to admit that the video was one of their most interesting.<br />4. \\"Lemon\\".  Again, Bono's falsetto is featured prominently, and the backing track with the delayed chords would spawn several dance remixes.  However, it is the subtle lyrics that makes this a strong track, even if it does drag a bit long.<br />5. \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close)\\".  The most traditional of the U2 fare, and the only one that still shows up in the live set, relies entirely on lyrical imagry for fuel.  (NOTE: This version is more to-the-point than the version that appears on the actual soundtrack to the film of the same name.)<br />6. \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car\\".  Another foray into industrial/dance beats and heavy samples, the lyrics explore the the nature of addiction.<br />7. \\"Some Days Are Better Than Others\\".  Nice bass and funny lyrics on this one, although if recorded during the sessions for any other record, it would probably have been a b-side.<br />8.\\"The First Time\\".  With a very subdued instrumental and somewhat heavy lyrics, the only thing bad about this tune is its striking similarity to \\"All I Want Is You\\" from 1988's 'Rattle and Hum'.<br />9. \\"Dirty Day\\".  Being the only true rock song on the record, this is one of the stronger songs, with the lyrics focusing on a regretful relationship between father and son.<br />10. \\"The Wanderer\\".  With Johnny Cash on lead (deep) vocals, which (as you can tell from the other reviews) fans either love or hate, this tune is easily the lyrical high point of the record.  (NOTE: A somewhat superior version of this track with additional lyrics appears on the soundtrack to Wim Wenders film, \\"Faraway, So Close!\\")

Such a small yet powerful book that can change so many lives. It makes everything so clear and to the point...Every sentence, every word has magic that shoots straight to the heart...Like music, it feeds the soul.Thank you don Miguel and Amber-Allen Publishing for these wonderful words of wisdom. I highly recommend this book along with don Miguel's other books, The Four Agreements Companion Book and The Mastery of Love.
B000001FA4|3.0|While it is true that this record was a huge leap forward for U2 and while there are some great songs on this record, the relative quality is somewhat marred by 4 of the songs that are at best, overindulgent, and at worst, just plain boring (&quot;Promenade&quot;, &quot;4th of July&quot;, &quot;Indian Summer Sky&quot;, and &quot;Elvis Presley in America&quot;).  Don't get me wrong - the other 6 songs are fantastic.  Nonetheless, even the best songs on this record have better live versions on other U2 records (&quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot; on 'Wide Awake in America' and &quot;Pride (in the Name of Love)&quot; on 'Rattle &amp; Hum').<br />It it worth noting that this is first U2 record bearing the influence of the Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno production team that later yielded the masterpieces 'The Joshua Tree' and 'Achtung Baby'.  In this case, I think U2/Eno/Lanois were all trying too hard to sound new and fresh.  But as 'The Joshua Thee' would later demonstrate, there is no substitute for good song-writing.<br />For these reasons, I would rank 'The Unforgettable Fire' as one of U2's most overrated records.  If you are looking to expand your 1980s-era U2 collection beyond 'The Best of 1980-1990', first acquire the records that came before and after - 'War' and 'The Joshua Tree'.
6300214826|4.0|Apocolypse Now starts off as a very promising movie. It gets into the pysche of soldiers very well. the disturbed feelings, confusion as to what they are fighting for etc. Having read many books about the conflict in Vietnam and feeling very strongly about it i could feel the pyschological tensions throughout the movie and could feel it build as it builds in the charachters as they go deeper into the jungle. However once they reach their destination i felt that the movie got lost in it's attempt to be an existential movie and got caught up in   the bizarness of the camp to the point of making it freakish. the first two thirds of the movie are excellent in terms of acting and cinematography but the ending is very disappointing.
B000001DTM|5.0|Although 'The Joshua Tree' is a more thoughtful album, lyrically, 'Achtung Baby' is the best overall record.<br />Abandoning the soap box for a new attititude, an appreciation for irony, and a distinctly electric sound that defied the unplugged trend that was taking over popular music at the time, this record was touted as one of the many \\"reinventions\\" of U2.   That said, it has everything that has always defined U2 - post-punk political angst (\\"Acrobat\\") and well-written ballads (\\"One\\" and \\"So Cruel\\").  But on this, their seventh studio release, the band found a groove (\\"Mysterious Ways\\") and a sense of humor about themselves (\\"The Fly\\").  Although the lyrics represented a shift toward more familiar subjects like relationships, Bono continued to wax philosophical over Edge's haunting guitar (\\"Love Is Blindness\\").  And as for those 1980s-era detractors who would assert that this record represented a selling-out of U2's sense of spiritual underpinnings for pop tendencies, I would answer that they simply do not understand the beauty of subtlety (\\"Until the End of the World\\").
B00004STPT|1.0|I may be the only person on the planet who thinks Zimmer ripped of Gustav Holst's Mars and his scoring partner ripped off Yanni.  The sound quality is stupendous, but if the Planets wasn't a public domain work, Zimmer would have his rear end sued for copyright infringement.  Overwrought.  One or two cuts will do ya.  For folks who'll never listen to classical music, go ahead.  I know I'll get hate mail, but I'm just stating an opinion here.
B00004Y9PP|3.0|Pitch Black is a good movie, but really it's just a jumble of a bunch of sci-fi movies thrown together.  It is a good movie, Vin Diesel is great and some of the coloring and cinematography is really inspired.  There are also good visual effects which lend to the overall glossy sheen of the films appearance.  My only problem is that Pitch Black does not break any new ground as a sci-fi adventure, it is well done but shamelessly copies aspects of other sci-fi movies like how the light harms the aliens.  Its pretty much a given that most of the cast is dead weight(literally) from the beginning, leaving only the strongest to survive.  I would recommend renting it, but only hardcore sci-fi buffs should buy it.
B00003XACV|5.0|Not as orchestral as Shawshank Redemption or Little Women, but if you've seen Gideon's Crossing - they are already ripping the American Beauty ST off.  Imitation is supposed to be one of the highest forms of flattery.  This is one of the most original scores I've ever heard.  Even though this is very pop sounding at times, the choice of instruments here is creative and bizarre, and the fretless bass on many of the tracks will keep your subwoofers popping.  A great addition for any Thomas Newman fan and ST collectors.
B000001ESP|5.0|There is not much more that can be said about Moving Pictures.  Clearly it is Rush's most polished effort, with the band clicking on all cylinders.  Peart's lyrics are intelligent and tackle intriguing subject matter(the &quot;trappings&quot; of pop stardom and Witch Hunts).  Lee and Lifeson's music is simply astonishing.  Tom Sawyer is definately overplayed and ironically so because Neil wrote the lyrics to it on a limo ride over to the studio as a filler song on this album.  Red Barchetta is a great song, more for the music than for the lyrics.  YYZ is one of the strongest instrumentals ever put on record, Peart's drumming never ceases to amaze.  But, anyone who really listens to Rush knows that the second side of Moving Pictures is far superior to the first side.  The Camera Eye is a sprawling, amazing work, multi-layered with lush soundscapes, one of Rush's best (and most overlooked) songs.  Witch Hunt is a nice departure from the innate accessibility of Moving Pictures, it is truly a song that takes numerous listens to appreciate.  Vital Signs is another hidden gem which is notable for its incredibly simple 4/4 drum part by Peart.  I luckily got to see Rush perform Vital Signs live on the Counterparts tour, it was amazing.  As much as I have lauded this release, I will say this, Hemispheres is a better overall album and Rush's best.  But there can be no doubt that this work ranks among the best progessive rock albums ever released.  It is really mind-boggling that Rush was never voted in to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame given their 26 year career and musicianship.  But really who cares?  All Rush fans know that Rush is an amazing talented band that the mainstream public fears listening to because they can't understand Peart's lyrics!
B00003CWTI|5.0|WITHOUT DOUBT ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE LAST THREE YEARS, AFTER THE CRITICAL SUCCESS OF BOOGIE NIGHTS EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING AT WHAT PT ANDERSON WAS GOING TOO DO NEXT. WELL WHAT AN PERFECT MOVIE. EVERY SINGLE PERFORMANCE WAS OUTSTANDING ESPECIALLY TOM CRUISE AND PHILIP BAKER HALL. ANOTHER THING AIMEE MANNS MUSIC WAS SO PERFECT IT MADE IT EVEN BETTER. I HAVE JUST WATCHED THE DVD AND THE DOCUMENTARY WITH PT ANDERSON REALLY  SHOWED ME HOW MUCH DETAIL WAS PUT INTO WHAT LOOKS LIKE ON FILM AS BEING QUITE EASY. THE MOVIE HAS A RUNNING TIME OF OVER 3 HOURS BUT I WOULD LIKED IT TO OF BEEN LONGER. HOW THIS DID NOT WIN ANY OSCARS IT A MYSTERY TO ME, ESPECIALLY THE BEST SUPPORTING CATEGORY.WITH THIS MOVIE PT ANDERSON HAS CREATED SOMETHING WHICH IN A COUPLE OF YEARS WILL BE ONE OF THE TALKED MOVIES OF ALL TIME. LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT HE WILL DO NEXT. IF YOU LIKE MOVIES AND YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT MAGNOLIA YET PLEASE DO SO TO AVOID EMBARRASSMENT FROM YOUR FRIENDS WHEN YOU TELL THEM.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is not regular beauty, it is deceitful, it is simply a cover for the ugly truth, but in that, it does a beautiful job. Or at least this movie does.<br /> Kevin Spacey, Anette Bening and their daughter seem like a wonderful all american happy family who live in a wonderful neighbourhood with wonderful gay neighbours. Then however, comes Lester's (Spacey) inside look into their lives. The wife is is a working mom who has turned into a complete workaholic whose only passion seems to be to beat her oponent in real estate. Lester has a lousy job with a company he can't stand. The daughter, although not as shallow as she may seem, is the ugly girl with the beautiful popular (or is she?) friend. <br /> Suddenly, one day, when Lester is about to lose his job, he realizes: I have nothing, it doesn't matter what I do, things can only get better! He blackmails his boss, gets a job at a drive through fast food restaurant, and adopts a completely new lifestyle. Meanwhile, the wife goes crazy with her new found love, her real estate enemy. <br /> The &quot;ugly&quot; daughter, who is in fact quite goodlooking, has problems of her own. The &quot;freak&quot; who lives next door has become obsessed with her. He follows her around with his camera, simply stands there silently and films her. Instead of scaring her, she becomes more and more interested in him. She finds him to be a lot more than simply a &quot;freak&quot;. He is an intelligent, individualistic person, interested in more than the shallow stuff teenagers are supposed to be interested in. He too has more dimensions than we initially see. Both are unique in the way they see beauty. It is not good looks, it is not popularity, it is everything. In a plastic bag, dancing on the wind...<br /> The mask is torn and the dysfunctional family becomes visible. But they don't care, they're living the lives they always wanted, no matter what people think. But will it last?<br /> Both Kevin Spacey and Anette Bening do some fabulous acting here. Bening plays her part very convincibly, and is extremely funny as the over-stressed workaholic working mom. Kevin Spacey is also perfect for the part, he plays his character in a very amusing way as well, especially when trying to hit on his teen daughter's best friend, who's a real American beauty as you find out later on.<br /> The characters are really charicatures of certain types of people, a good example being the boy next door's dad, an ex military man, hard on his son, hates homosexuals (or does he...?), makes his son do a urine test every couple months to make sure he's sober, amazingly written, very insightful.<br /> American Beauty is a very amusing movie, although very sad and a little depressing when you think abotu the characters a bit more, but absolutely an amazing movie. The fact that it was such a blockbuster movie made me a little weary of seeing it, considering the quality of many movies nowadays, but this came as quite a surprise to me. I actually saw it 3 more times after that and would gladly see it again. Almost everyone I know who has seen it, absolutely loved it, for various reason. Don't let the rating withhold you, if you're not into movies with nudity, strong language or drug use, because this movie contains very little, and is without a doubt worth it!!!

6304362498|5.0|Michael Radford's film of George Orwell's novel is perhaps the greatest cinematic adaptation ever made from a well-known literary source, and it stands out as one of the most memorable and underrated British films of the past thirty years.  Radford treats the book neither as grim political prophecy nor as  Wellsian flight of sci-fi futurist speculation.  Instead, we are presented with the ruined world of 1948 as seen through a glass darkly - NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR done straight as a kind of medieval morality play for the post-totalitarian age.  The end credits inform us, with but a modest air of self-importance, that the picture was shot \\"in and around London, April-June 1984, at the exact place and time imagined by the author.\\"  And the uncanny meta-fictional parallels don't stop there: the actors are so close to Orwell's descriptions, they practically seem born for their roles.   <br />Resembling a gaunt, ashen-faced figure out of Egon Schiele, John Hurt is ideally cast as Winston Smith.  As Julia, Suzanna Hamilton (first seen as a lovelorn dairymaid in Polanski's TESS and then as the paralyzed daughter in BRIMSTONE AND TREACLE) has a haunting and mysteriously stirring presence.  Beyond the bluff, two-dimensional gamine of the novel, she brings a genuine warmth, substance, and fascination to her character - a little reminiscent, at times, of a young Harriet Andersson sans the continental coquettishness.  Her pale, wiry, broad-hipped body has a simple, unaffected, even startling beauty; and in her more physically revealing scenes (there are many in the film), she radiates all the tactile sensual grace of a nude by Munch or Degas. <br />The late Richard Burton, featured in his last screen role, is the oracular Thanatos to Hamilton's Eros.  As the grand inquisitor, O'Brien, he inhabits this shadowy and inscrutable character with more than just a sly hint of the demon-plagued Jesuit priests he portrayed in THE EXORCIST II and ABSOLUTION.  In a maliciously Swiftian twistof irony, the famous Burton voice - the voice of classical drama, of poetry, indeed, of all that is held to be ennobling and edifying about mankind's estate - becomes a subtle and precisely modulated instrument of dehumanization.  His death shortly after completing work on the film lends it a particularly cruel and all-too-human pathos.  When he says to Hurt, \\"you are thinking that my face is old and tired...and while I talk of power I am unable to prevent the decay of my own body,\\" the lines in Burton's craggy, weathered face speak volumes for him.  It's an exquisite swan-song performance, patient and quietly devastating. <br />In addition to the superb ensemble cast, much credit is due to production designer Allan Cameron and cinematographer Roger Deakins, who shoots everything in a grainy, desaturated monochrome of blues and greys.  The stark high-contrast photography often evokes the power and purity of Dreyer and Bresson, and there is even one extraordinary shot of a battered and delirious Hurt awaiting torture that is an unmistakable homage to Falconetti's famous haircutting scene in LA PASSION DE JEANNE D'ARC.  Also notable is Dominic Muldowney's operatic score, an ingenious and even moving parody of Elgar's patriotic overtures and Prokofiev's Stalinist anthems.  But it is Phyllis Logan (the star of Radford's first feature, ANOTHER TIME, ANOTHER PLACE, and a supporting player in Mike Leigh's SECRETS AND LIES) who provides the film with one its most caustic conceits.  As the unseen voice of the Telescreen Announcer, her incessant nannyish hectoring suggests a more shrill caricature of Margaret Thatcher. <br />The film is impressive less for its fidelity to its source than its harrowingly vivid sense of realism, and how unobtrusively Radford manages to transcend the faults and contradictions of the novel to create an entirely plausible dystopian vision with a life of its own.  That in itself makes NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR a great and original piece of filmmaking -its seamless perfection is still practically unequaled in the English-language cinema of recent years.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This album is great!  Fred durst is an awesome vocalist.  I would really buy this, it is even so much better than the last one.  Ok and rollin' and Hold On are the best songs on here but all  of em are cool.  This is not garbage!
6301966015|5.0|Michelangelo Antonioni's BLOW-UP offers us a subtle and disturbing reading of the modern world.  The film follows a day in the life of Thomas, a young hotshot fashion photographer (based on the notorious David Bailey), played with puckish insolence by David Hemmings.  Antonioni's particular brand of phenomenological Neorealism is based on the idea of the camera lens as a way of exposing the ultimate truth, or lack thereof, that underlies the surface of the world.  We watch as Thomas investigates his photographs, scrutinizing them obsessively and blowing them up larger and larger so that eventually they become nothing more than an abstract collection of dots - a kind of Rorschach test in which almost anything can be read.  The received cultural baggage of the image is eliminated until all that remains is purest subjectivity of the spectator.  Once this threshold of semiotic referentiality has been crossed, the suspicion of a murder in the park gleaned from a series of augmented photographs would seem to say more about Thomas' own paranoid state of mind than what his camera may or may not have recorded.  <br />This subtextual aspect of the film has been compared to the controversy surrounding the various interpretations of the Abraham Zapruder film as a definitive and reliable record of the Kennedy assassination, and in particular, the mystery of the notorious `grassy knoll.'  The possible incidence of adultery and The Girl's desperate efforts to retrieve the negatives seem an oblique reference to the scandalous fallout of the Profumo affair.  Vanessa Redgrave, with her thick, dark brown hair and affected temptress-naïf manner (hinted at by a schoolgirl outfit and arms folded seductively over her breasts) seems meant to evoke, for a British audience at least, then-recent memories of Christine Keeler.  Thomas himself resembles Odysseus in the way he is continually thwarted by chance meetings that cause him to lose sight of his mission, and the film's meandering, episodic structure does indeed seem to contain elements of classical epic.  His shirtless tryst with The Girl, for example, recalls Odysseus' first encounter on the beach with Nausíkaa, and the rock concert and marijuana party he attends afterward suggests a journey through the Land of the Lotus-Eaters.  <br />Like Antonioni's earlier LA NOTTE, the action of BLOW-UP takes place entirely within the span of twenty-four hours.  It follows the travails of a solitary person in a highly subjective manner, with the unmediated banality of his experience conveyed through relentless longueurs and temps morts - roughly approximating, in stripped down cinematic language, the narrative design of James Joyce's ULYSSES.  But just like Godard in LE MÉPRIS, Antonioni inverts the themes of Joyce's novel by revealing the search for human contact in sex as a spiritual dead end and showing man as ultimately bewildered, uncomprehending, and impotent before the demands of the modern world. <br />As a self-referential odyssey through the heart of a modern city, BLOW-UP seems a trenchant comment on the nature of success and what it does to people.  It certainly was Antonioni's greatest commercial success (as a struggling film student in Bologna during the Fascist era, the director was also a champion tennis player who had to sell his trophies to buy food and pay the rent).  New wealth and creature comforts can often bring us a false sense of power and security, which eventually turns to disillusionment, and even a desperate feeling of helplessness, when we come to learn of mysterious (and perhaps malign) forces existing outside the scope of our control and understanding.  Here, the Marxist Antonioni demonstrates once again that this malaise of modern life is not caused by technology and consumer culture but rather by man's failure to adapt to the conditions of the new environment he has created for himself.
0805002014|5.0|My eighteen month old daughter absolutely loves this book! She has learned about animals and colors by reading this book.  She brings me the book and says &quot;read&quot; and I love seeing her enjoying learning about new things. Her eyes light up when she can point and say &quot;dog&quot; and know that she is right. This is a wonderful book for any child.
B00000J7J4|5.0|I continue to listen to this album regularly.  Having been introduced to Santana in 1995, this album re-affirmed his genius as a guitarist for me.  Highly recommended!
B00004XPOZ|5.0|I've had a copy of the re-re-re-release classic movies, namely the 1990's movie (the evil formatted copy). Then saw the real version on the scifi channel, the widescreen, with comentary from Billy De Willams and making of each film. Went to see the 20th anniversary release in the theatres for a dozen times and was blown away. Bought the only version out there, the widescreen version of the special editions. I'm going to buy the another release of these movies in widescreen, with a making of episode two.<br />The only way you could ever truely enjoy these classic movies is in widescreen and not in the evil version. Space is a pretty big place and is wasted on watching Star Wars and any other space movie formatted. It's the only way to hear John William's wonderful classic scores, the THX sound quality and Dolby Digital Sorround Sound. To see the battle in widescreen feels like your in the movie, to see it formatted is a waste of time and money. But to see it on DVD is truely would be a treat and I'll buy twelve dozen copy's. I'm thinking about purching a DVD player and buy only DVD movies.Star Wars DVD would be placed in special place and would be the Holy Grail of my movies.<br />P.s. I want Star Wars in DVD.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|selmasongs is an interesting EP. obviously a soundtrack to the movie, it plays well on it's own too. Scatterheart and I've Seen it All are by far the most rewarding songs on this mini album. With an instrumental overture, and a song completely about climbing stairs, we are really only left with 5 true bjork numbers. Combining the energy of &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot; with the sonic force (albeit a much more subdued version of it) of Homogenic, we are given a wonderful collection of songs that may not rank among her greatest work, but in true Bjork fashion, gives us another glance into the mind and heart of a true artist.
B000001FRY|5.0|Very few recordings on the charts in 1980 can stand up to this today. Sooo much back in the day seems silly now, but this does not. No pop-synth bubble gum music here.
B000002AHC|5.0|&quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; is--aside perhaps from the mighty &quot;Revolver&quot;--the greatest pop album of all time.  Inspired by The Beatles' recent achievements, embroiled in bandmember controversies (David Crosby was fired and Mike Clarke quit during the sessions), fuelled by drugs and yet reaching a creative peak that kept refining and expanding on the experimental direction of &quot;Fifth Dimension&quot; and &quot;Younger Than Yesterday&quot;, the splintered Byrds somehow managed to come up<br />with a collection of songs which stand more like polished jewels than mere tunes.  &quot;Notorious&quot; was to represent the final evolution of the group's sound before the backpedalling to country music that followed on &quot;Sweetheart Of The Rodeo&quot;; it  fared well in the UK (peaking at #12) but stiffed in the US (#48) where the group were suddenly considered passe.  It is a stunning work, a diverse collection of sounds and lyrical subject matter which is nonetheless unified by the group's <br />Taoist sense of ebb and flow; the sonic delights are smooth, tasteful and subtle, with not a single note or arrangement out of place and some of the most ingenious song fade-outs/fade-ins in the history of vinyl.  The end result is a song cycle which  takes one on a sonic trip that begins with an amphetamine rush and ends on the moon, with each sound--no matter how diverse, ranging from string quartets, raga-ish guitar solos, moog synthesizers, celeste, phasing, horns and those heavenly vocal harmonies--coalescing into one hypnotic rush, like a series of linked watercolors.  This is pure art, a producer's wet dream, aiding some of the strongest lyrics and melodies ever written.  Crosby's presence is essential, although the album might have been even greater had he stayed (he claims to have written &quot;Guinevere&quot;, &quot;Wooden Ships&quot; and &quot;Laughing&quot; all on the day he was fired, and it is highly possible that the exquisite &quot;Guinevere&quot; and &quot;Laughing&quot; would've placed on the album).  What we are left with instead is the still-eyebrow raising CD bonus cut &quot;Triad&quot;, which should've also been on the album and is now restored to its rightful place.  McGuinn and Hillman also reach artistic heights here, and Hillman's bass playing is a wonder to behold.  What is so great about &quot;Notorious&quot; is that it is an epic that manages to fly naturally and harmoniously; it is neither too grandiose or too mild, but hits that perfect middle where social comment (the vivid anti-war sentiment of &quot;Draft Morning&quot;), wonder (the underwater mysticism in &quot;Dolphin's Smile&quot;), bittersweet reminiscing (&quot;Goin' Back&quot;) and surrealist pop storytelling (&quot;Old John Robinson&quot;) reflect and reinforce each other to create a tapestry that casually insinuates its philosophical brilliance without ever outstaying its welcome.  This is most certainly an album that requires the listener's full attention (preferably through headphones), as all of the little production nuances must be heard to be believed (remember, this was recorded in 1967).  It only boggles the mind that the album could've been even greater had Crosby stayed, as it is already one of the top two or three greatest recorded statements of all time, and a perfect recreation of the changing attitudes of America in the mid to late 60s.
B000001ESJ|4.0|On this album, Rush showed a maturation of their progressive rock style.  There are a few shorter songs (including their first AOR hit, &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;) but the meat of the album really lies in the longer pieces: &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot; and &quot;Xanadu&quot;.  The latter in particular is fantastic, one of Rush's all-time classics.  The title track is also wonderful and one of the band's most underrated tunes; the start-stop middle section may grate on some, but if you aren't bothered by Geddy's screeching on &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot; then it shoudl be of no consequence.  This is an album well worth picking up.
B00003CXCS|5.0|I have been anxiously awaiting the DVD release of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and the final result is worth the wait. The clarity of the picture is incredible.It seems in the widescreen format that one sees a lot more than the typical pan and scan.  Richard Rodgers immortal score sounds wonderful. I really enjoy the feature that allows one to hear the score without dialogue. None of the heartwarming and touching qualities are lost in this version. No matter how many times I see it, I still get misty eyed.

6301647734|5.0|Elwood P. Dowd is happy to share a drink with anybody he meets,  and he likes to give them his card and invite them to have dinner at his home. His charm is disarming. People will tell their troubles over a drink, he says. Then he introduces them to his friend, Harvey, and Harvey is sooo much bigger than anything they've got... Harvey is an invisible (usually), six-foot tall white rabbit. Harvey is also too big for Elwood's society-conscious sister, Veta, and her unattached daughter, Myrtle Mae, to cope with. Veta makes a mistake, however, when she tries to get Elwood committed to a sanatorium.<br />Jimmy Stewart is superb as Elwood P. Dowd, but Josephine Hull steals the show as his totally flustered sister. She is, quite simply, at her wits' end. This is one of only two movies that I know of that feature Hull (the other is &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;). Both are personal favorites, and Hull is excellent in both. The rest of the cast is also outstanding in this adaptation from a classic Broadway play. Many moments are hilarious, some are touching, and it all adds up to a terrific movie. This witty romp will be welcome in almost anyone's video library.
B00004XONN|5.0|I have been a longtime fan of Radiohead.  They have always had music that was just on the fringe of pop/alternative and has always been somewhat avante garde.  I bought Kid A without hearing anything off of it, and I thrilled at what I found. Kid A is a bit of a departure from previous Radiohead ventures, trading in their usual rock/guitar sound for a more ambient-techno feel.  The sound suits them well and easily conveys the moody spacey sounds of the CD.  Nothing sounds like this... it is hard to even put into a genre.  Is it techno?  Is is pop?  Is it Alternative?  Yes... it is all of the above and yet not really any of them.  If you can have a religious experience while listening to a CD, this is it.  No review will do it justice... if you like Radiohead in the least bit, buy the CD.
B000002O3I|5.0|It's impossible to play favorites with any song performed by Howlin' Wolf and this two for one compilation is no exception.  The Wolf's skill on the guitar and his slightly scratchy voice make each song an individual masterpiece.  Containing his first two albums, &quot;Howlin' Wolf&quot; and &quot;Moanin' In the Moonlight&quot; this is one Blues album not to be missed.<br />Required listening for any fan of the Blues from one of its most influential and endearing artists.
0553106635|5.0|This was an amazing book. Martin takes you on a rollercoaster. He flips you up and down, turning you around until you don't know which way you are facing. I'd been waiting for months for this, and when I finally got it I couldn't put it down. It can be really irritating, coz you finally get to a cliffhanger with one character and he changes to another. It was great to see some more characters added to the first person view, and gives you a much larger insight into their personality. One thing I really like about Martin is he's not afraid to kill main characters off. Many authors will not touch a central figure, so to have so many drop off like flies was a real shock. And then the epilogue, who was expecting that? I recommend this to anyone who wants a really good, epic fantasy series. Excellent characters, great plot and makes you see everything from all sides. The only warning, the guy is only getting started, we're in for a long haul. But it really is worth it. Buy it, you will not regret it.
B000002L3P|5.0|Kenny Wayne Shepherd proves he's worthy of some pretty lofty company, drawing comparisons ranging from Jimi Hendrix to Stevie Ray Vaughn (both of which he states as influences).  And like those late great musicians Shepherd plays the guitar as if it were an extension of his own arms.  Every song is a conglomeration of seemingly impossible riffs and strong lyrics.  An intense and near perfect debut that made Kenny Wayne Shepherd a household name.  Standout songs are  &quot;Born With A Broken Heart&quot;, &quot;Aberdeen&quot;, &quot;Everybody Gets The Blues&quot;, &quot;While We Cry&quot;, &quot;I'm Leaving You (Commit A Crime)&quot;, and &quot;What's Going Down&quot;.  An essential album for guitar worshippers everywhere!
B000002I8D|5.0|&quot;Face Value&quot;, an album featuring tracks primarily rooted in soul and r &amp; b, is in a class by itself. &quot;In The Air Tonight&quot; is wonderful power-pop, while songs like &quot;I Missed Again&quot;, &quot;Thunder And Lightning&quot;, the remake of Genesis' &quot;Behind The Lines&quot; and &quot;Hand In Hand&quot; feaure r &amp; b influences provided by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's brassy horn section, which is heard on a majority of the tracks here. The Motown sound and psychedelia are featured in the tracks &quot;If Leaving Me Is Easy&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; (where Phil can be heard singing a line from the Wizard Of Oz's &quot;Over The Rainbow&quot;- sort of unusual). There's also a jug-band feel to &quot;The Roof Is Leaking&quot;, and mambo rhythms featured in &quot;Droned&quot;. Phil Collins does a good job here in utilizing different musical styles, which makes &quot;Face Value&quot; worth its weight in gold and is a must-have CD.

B00002MHS1|5.0|The original 1970 disc \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" is one of those albums that marks the end of Sixties music for me and I have always thought of \\"Glad\\" as the song that really allowed Traffic to justify their name and really jam. I truly cannot think of a better instrumental number from this period (the end of \\"Layla\\" does not count), plus I have an irrevocable association in my mind for the song and one of the more interesting movies I saw my first semester of college.  Ironically, this was not supposed to be a Traffic album but the first solo album for Steve Winwood, who was still only 22 years old at that point although already a veteran of the Spencer Davis Group with the classic \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\" on his resume as the definitive screaming organ piece of the decade.  Winwood intended to play all of the instruments on his album (just like Paul McCartney did on his self-titled solo album that same year), but then Winwood had Jim Capaldi and then Chris Wood to help work on the sessions and suddenly Traffic had not only its first album in a year but its best one.<br /><br />The most amazing thing about this album is that while you have the opening track \\"Glad,\\" perhaps the best example of jazz influence in rock and roll, you also have the mournful folk ballade \\"John Barleycorn,\\" with the voices of Winwood and Capaldi entwined over and around an acoustic guitar.  You would swear these songs had to come from different albums because they really have nothing in common representing jazz and folk as they do. This time around the band takes the time to explore their songs, with four of the songs lasting longer than six minutes, which in 1970 was really considered pushing the envelope.  It also signaled a new level of musical commitment for the group to artistic rather than commercial success, since these were the four longest songs they had recorded to date. The group might still be jamming, but at a higher level that before their last breakup because they are simply on the same wavelength at this point.<br /><br />The other thing that strikes me about Traffic is that they really knew how to start a song, especially the awesome piano lick that begins \\"Glad,\\" but also on \\"Stranger to Himself\\" and \\"John Barleycorn.\\"  The album made it to #5 on the Billboard album chart.  \\"Empty Pages\\" was actually released as the obligatory single and although it is arguably the catchiest tune on the album and shows Winwood's virtuostity on the electric piano only made it to #64 on the singles chart.  As for the question of whether \\"Freedom Rider\\" is really about Jim Morrison of the Doors, you can make of that what you will, but it is too late for me to make that a major association in my appreciation of the song.  \\"Stranger to Himself\\" is actually a message song, but focusing on the lyrics is always problematic on this album given the attention that must be paid to the music.  That is why \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" is arguably the greatest Sixties album not produced in the actual decade of the Sixties.wavelength at this point.

B00004X01U|4.0|I have always liked almost all of Madonna's songs. The ones on her new CD are definitely great, especially &quot;Music,&quot; which is number two on the charts right now! I thought the CD had a great variety of Madonna's new songs. I enjoyed every one of them. I didn't really care for the front of the album though, I felt that they could have come up with something a little more enticing. Madonna is one of those singers that will always be good, popular, and successful. This new CD is well-worth the money because it brings many hours of enjoyment.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|This is a groundbreaking Heavy Metal debut from this party hearty band.  Eddie Van Halen alters the style of hard rock guitar playing with his numerous whammy bar effects and dive bomb noises.  Eruption is a frequent guitar solo played by many guitarists of other bands during the course of a concert.  Outside of that Ice Cream Man, Running With The Devil, You Really Got Me, Janie's Crying, and Aint Talking About Love will always go down as hard rock classics.  Little Dreamer and Feel Your Love Tonight are somewhat hidden gems.  And I forgot to add what charisma on the part of that David Lee Roth character.  This is one of the first three Van Halen discs to get.
B00000JY1X|5.0|How did I come to buy this 3Cd set from the Magnetic Fields when I had never heard of them or Stephin Merritt only a month ago?<br />I accidently discovered Stephin Merritt's 6ths Wasps' Nests album on National Public Radio on KUOW in Seattle, Washington.  The song &quot;San Diego Zoo&quot; was played in an overlay between two segments. Captured by the music, I called the station and got the album title. Following an impulse, I purchased all of the 6ths albumns via amazon.com sound unheard.<br />Blown away...I jump into the mix and discovered Stephin Merritt had a rather amazing history. Within weeks I owned all of the Gothic Archies, MF and the Sixths works. Only naturally, I bought this 3cd set sound unheard, too!<br />This is a fabulous collection of bittersweet love songs with humorous lyrics and glorious rythms. With all the pain of Lou Reed songs, yet the clarity of Richard Thompson, Stephin Merritt captures all the varying hues of love from start to finish. These 3 cds are why I bought an expensive sound system instead of a decent TV.<br />While our airwaves are littered with the benign pop tunes of B. Spears and BackStreet Boys etc....it is refreshing to know there are artists out there willing to ignore the big labels to constantly and consistently put out great music. However, I have a sneaky suspicion it is the Big Labels who will not ignore such talents for long.<br />My SONY CD player holds five CDs at a time. For the past 2 weeks it has contained these 3CDS and the 2CD White Album. Pretty good company.<br />Cheers to Stephin, Claudia, Sam, John, LD, Daniel, Shirley and the rest of Magnetic Fields for putting out an album that rivals anything I have heard in years.
0060930349|5.0|Mr. Johnson is simply astounding in his ability to present the complex history of the birth and development of the United States in a interesting and coherent whole. He defies the current revisionist hegemony in our academic institutions. Johnson correctly recognizes the important contributions of business, those derided in historical scholarship as &quot;robber barons&quot;, to both society and the forging of a world power. His treatment the misguided social policies of the FDR era and afterward has been borne out by time. Read Johnson's Modern Times to see where such social engineering leads to when taken to extremes. And while I respect the leftist guilty conscience of the critic below and will concede that cases such as the Civil Rights movement might have been given more space, however mere confusion of confederate generals does not a bad book make. Howard Zinn is your man (he desperately wants the Indians to win), or any of the other works of resentment which fill the shelves. While we have not in every case lived up to our ideals, Johnson brings out the truth that the United States has made many remarkable achievements and done much good in the world. This perspective has now been given its due. I highly recommend A History of the American People, as well as any of Johnson's other works.
B000003N7R|5.0|Brilliant in every way! I especially like &quot;Take the Coltrane&quot;. Pure genius! Should be a desert island disc for all jazz lovers, all music lovers! Period!
B00004XQP4|1.0|Hi,  My name is johnny caustic.... I think Green Day are the worst band in the world. I listened to this CD and I was getting all these negative vibes from it. . . I think Billy should sing about real punk rock like Blink does and like Smashing Pumpkins. I had Billy stay over at my house once and he started playing my acoustic guitar and singing The Beatles songs. I saw them live when they played in New York. I had to travel a long way and it wasn't worth it... Though I did get to go backstage and I handed the drummmer a cardboard box of over 30 hatemail letters I haven't got around to sending, then he started talking to me about how their new album was going to be so new and different from their other stuff, and then I started pushing him and getting in his face so he backed off. I think they need to make the songs on this album faster and more positive, I wrote a song called &quot;I love you and we should seriously get together sometime&quot; and I think their songs need titles like that to make us feel more like the emo kids we all are inside. That moral majority song is really great and I heard that they put in some really quiet jokes in the left speaker if you turn the rest down. My stereo can't do that, but try it for yourself. [Bye] Haha!

B00004XONN|5.0|Since the day i listened to OK Computer, I couldn't even imagine that there could be a better album than that. But i was completely wrong! Kid A is better than OCK(in my opinion) but it is actually different than OKC and there is no way we can compare them. OKC is a masterpiece itself, but each Kid A's song tends to be a masterpiece. Songs like &quot;Everything in it's right place&quot;, &quot;National Anthem&quot; and &quot;Idioteque&quot; show the (huge)gap between Radiohead and other bands. Radiohead (with Kid A) showed the road to the future. &quot;Radiohead have just walked off the edge of the map. Who will dare to follow them?(BBC)&quot;. That was a very brave try from Radiohead.Thanks them for offering us MUSIC!
B00004XPPE|5.0|What a movie! I have seen this film at least 10 times and my  heart still races each time. This is one movie that had the guts to pull out all the stops. No happy hollywood ending here,  they go all out, giving the viewer a good look at the cold war sixties, and the fallout of playing with nuclear fire.  The small but powerfull role that walter matthau has is priceless. If you are looking for a good thriller, you won't be disapointed with this one.
B000002U82|5.0|It's incredible to see 500 plus reviews of this the most luminous, intellectual LP of rock n' roll. Every note, every lyric, every heartbeat has its place in this masterpiece. I had just graduated high school when &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; was released. DSOTM came out the year before &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot; and brought rock n' roll, as we knew it, to its finest hour. From &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; (1967) to &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot; (1974) rock n' roll crescendoed into the outer sphere's pinnacle of the thinking man's psychedelic vision of humanity. And DSOTM flung this movement of heavy metal into that final orbit of being the quintessential statement of art and politics of the flower power generation.  I suppose one could go into the different tracks (nine of them) on the LP. But for me the whole cannot be broken down into parts or tracks. Each song blends into the next without any signal that there is a separation. If you haven't heard DSOTM then you've missed rock n' roll's finest, purest hour. This is a symphony of perfect synergy! The history books of our generation will all mention the triumph of this masterpiece. It would be incomplete without DSOTM's inclusion.
B00000JXV7|4.0|This romantic comedy is in the same vein as It Happened One Night, The Out of Towners and Planes, Trains and Automobiles. It is the most similar to It Happened One Night, in trying to decide on marriage. Things were a lot more clear in that age. The parents in this comedy are great too. I am a Sandra Bullock fan, she is good in this part.  I mean it is modern times and you don't have to get hysterical. I believe it was ingenious some of the plot twists they chose. It is not slow moving or boring, very entertaining. Feel free to email me with questions or comments.
0399224459|5.0|Many child development experts now know that if you don't just read a book but embellish on every page, your child will learn more and be much more interested in reading. Good Night, Gorilla is *ideal* for this style of reading and learning. <br />Each of the first ten or so times I read it to my daughter, I noticed a new detail that had slipped my attention previously. My favorite fun detail is the balloon s-l-o-w-l-y rising into the sky. You can see the balloon or its trailing string on almost every page.<br />I recommend this book whole heartedly and will continue to read it to my daughter until she tells me to get over it.  ;^)
078324228X|4.0|&quot;The Hurricane&quot; tells the story of Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter (played by Denzel Washington), the boxer framed for murder and who served 19 years in prison before being exonerated in 1985.  The movie, directed by Norman Jewison (&quot;Moonstruck,&quot; &quot;A Soldier's Story), goes back and forth through time, interspursing Carter's early life and boxing career with scenes from his prison life.<br />The movie seems disjointed, combining the black-and-white slow motion boxing scenes of &quot;Raging Bull&quot; with the plot of a prisoner framed for murder with stirring music (&quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot;) who remakes himself by self-education in prison (&quot;Malcolm X&quot;).  (Jewison, by the way was supposed to have made the biographical film of Malcolm X, only to let Spike Lee make the movie when Lee protested having a white man do it.  This was fortunate, since &quot;Malcolm X&quot; is a much stronger movie than &quot;The Hurricane,&quot; with a clearer, more effective structure and better storytelling.)<br />The movie also draws its lines between good and evil in a simplistic fashion, as the bad Detective Pesca (Dan Hedaya) takes aim at the wholesome Carter.  It does not draw the depth in its characters that a &quot;Malcolm X&quot; or &quot;American Beauty&quot; does and loses credibility because of it.<br />One major reason this film is entertaining despite these problems is the acting, especially the strong performance of Washington, who immerses himself in the role (and who probably should have won the Best Acting Oscar).  Also very strong is Vicellous Reon Shannon as the 15-year-old boy who reads Carter's biography and is inspired to help free Carter (as well as eventually go to college).  <br />Carter's story is the other force driving this movie -- in today's society, where calling a racist a &quot;racist&quot; is often considered more offensive than being a racist, the story of a boxer likely on his way to the world championship is put in prison (and kept there well into the 1980's) is sobering.
B00000253N|5.0|An era began with Dylan's &quot;Freewheelin'&quot; and ended with &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot;. Bookends to a period in time in the United States that couldn't be contained by the convestional wisdom of the past. It was a revolution with somewhere to go but a &quot;somewhere&quot; that couldn't last. &quot;Blood On The Tracks&quot; was one man's broken heart splattered with every footstep, and a generation's broken dreams splattered in the footprints of every life. BOTT summed the reality of living life without the illusions of love, peace and humanity. Sure they remain the ideals to strive toward and measure our existence. However, what does it all mean when you can't keep it together in your personal life. The words become hollow when you haven't the wisdom to live them as Dylan, the very human sage, scrapes his belly on the hard asphalt bleeding bleeding in every song. &quot;Tangled Up In Blue&quot; (what a powerful and poetic title) tells you how it all began as he sits reflecting back. &quot;Simple Twist Of Fate&quot; (Baez did a hilarious interpretation) one of his best songs. Great imagery and dark humor. &quot;Idiot Wind&quot; looks at himself and wonders how anything works out when you think of what idiots we are. &quot;Meet Me In The Morning&quot; great blues piece. Sounds like his &quot;best of&quot; early stuff. &quot;If You See Her, Say Hello&quot; is my favorite cut. The honesty and courage of these lyrics are unforgettable. This song really bleeds! &quot;Buckets Of Rain&quot; (Midler did this as a duet with Dylan on her &quot;Songs For A New Depression&quot; LP) is another instant classic. Even when Dylan distances himself (like he seems to do here) he bleeds everywhere. The next Dylan release to equal BOTT was his &quot;Time Out Of Mind&quot; cd (more blood splattered on the tracks and on the walls, the ceiling, everywhere!). Listen to them back to back. Listen to &quot;Not Dark Yet&quot; and &quot;Make You Feel My Love&quot; then listen to &quot;Meet Me In The Morning&quot; and &quot;If You See Her, Say Hello&quot; (especially the cut on &quot;the bootleg series&quot; which is infinitely more poignant and cutting) and the cycle of Dylan's heart floods through the gates. TOOM is a more desperate and cutting and telling continuation of BOTT.
B00004SCX6|3.0|Some of the songs are pretty cool, but the music of the upbeat songs sounds similar to me.  And the total sound of the album is just like Baby One More Time.
B000002I25|5.0|This is the album that made them big. If you know little to nothing about the Doors and have heard very few songs, this is the album for you. Hits like &quot;Light my Fire&quot;, &quot;Break on Through&quot;, and &quot;Alabama Song (whiskey bar)&quot; are excellent.  &quot;Backdoor Man&quot;, &quot;End of the Night&quot;, &quot;Crystal Ship&quot;, and &quot;The End&quot; are amazing songs.  Morrison's haunting voice on &quot;crystal ship&quot;, &quot;end of the night&quot;, and &quot;the end&quot; is almost enough to send chills up your spine.  This isnt the Doors best album, but it is definitly in the top three.  There is a wide variety of music styles on this album, so it is tough to go wrong. The best reason to buy this album is for the songs that are NOT on the greatest hits collections.  Although several are, the ones that arent make this a real treat.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Limp bizkit just does not have it anymore. Unless they remake a song with GOOD lyrics like &quot;faith&quot;, they can't write a good song. The first cd was original. With songs like &quot;counterfeit&quot;, and &quot;sour&quot;, they really did mix in the hip hop with some hard stuff. This new one is crap. They lyrics are so meaningless, and half the time don't make any sense. The songs are almost all hip hop (and not even very good hip hop) without any screaming or muxing in any other hard core. Don't waste your time or money on this junk. Get something better such as Primer 55, or The Deadlights. If you are looking for some good hard core i recommend Mudvayne, or Snot. They are much better and more talented.
6305127689|3.0|This movie is fun for teenagers who like to walk around with their shirts off and talk about girls they want to sleep with.  Trust me, I was one when this movie first came out.  It's also a stunning documentary of homosexuality in the Navy. The story's about a school of Navy fliers who compete to be &quot;Top Gun!&quot;.  Tom Cruise stars in his first blockbuster as &quot;Maverick&quot; a role he will recreate in &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; and even &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;.<br />The action still holds up and Cruise is still cool if that counts for anything, even that guy from E.R. is still funny.  <br />But for me, where this movie sort of hits a wall is Kelly McGillis as Cruise's girlfriend.  What were Bruckhiemer and Don Simpson thinking?  Did they lose a bet to McGillis' agent or something?  In some of the love scenes, I thought Maverick was making out with Iceman.  They should of had Meg Ryan as Cruise's girlfriend, I mean she was in the movie anyway.  McGillis is an okay actress but she has to rank up there with Margot Kidder and Andy Dick as one of the most unattractive leading ladies of all time. <br />I'm still waiting for the sequel.

0679879269|5.0|As the finale to His Dark Materials, this book is a beautiful, thought provoking book, while remaining a fun read. I was definitely impressed with Pullman as a writer after reading this series. Pullman has been compared to Tolkien, but his stories are so much more imaginative... Tolkien based most of his mythology on Norse and Old English mythology. Pullman invents whole new universes. The part with the mulefa i enjoyed especially. The multiple plotlines were handled well, thought; some have criticized the 'cardboad' characters but Will and Lyra were very well developed as growing young adults, not just as children any more.<br />Also, as with any provocative book, people have taken offense at Pullman's depiction of Christianity. All I can say is, I was raised as a Christian but later had doubts. This book really provoked my mind further and made me think about Christian history, and to my mind much of what the book said was true. Anyway, to have a healthy debate you need both sides and if the Christian Right criticizes this book on these grounds I will definitely lose what little respect I have for them.<br />The ending was very well done, and haunting (people may not realize why Mary Malone was the tempter, but its because of her stories about love and the marzipan- which provoked that incident between Lyra and Will, akin to eating the forbidden fruit).  It was also heart breaking... I am normally not a sentimental person but this ending really affected me.<br />But read this book. Its a thrilling series if nothing else... but very beautiful as well.
0440219078|4.0|I picked up this book because someone told me it was a science fiction and I am always on the look out for new sci-fi.  I was instantly hooked.  This book is a page turner.  It's about a boy who lives in a community that does not have freedom of expression or freedom of choice.  When he turns twelve he is chosen by the community leaders to be the receiver of the Memories.  Throughout the rest of the book strange things begin to happen to him.  He must confront his value system and struggle to find a place where he belongs.  The ending leaves you wanting more.
B00004WGAI|5.0|...this IS the best film version of 'Jane Eyre', and I've no doubt that Charlotte would agree. <br />One day in the eighth grade, my English teacher Mrs. Thompson informed us we would be watching 'Jane Eyre' in class that week. I'd heard of the novel but never read it, and I had no knowledge of the plot or characters. I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not but decided to keep an open mind. Within half an hour I was hooked, and deeply disappointed when the bell rang to signal the end of class. I wanted to stay and watch it all in one sitting. I went to the library that day and checked out the novel.<br />Our class watched 'Jane Eyre' all week, and I fell in love with it! Everything was just perfect: The scenery was gorgeous, the story suspenseful and satisfying, the characters intriguing. No one could have played Edward Rochester and Jane better than Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, and no one has. Ms. Clarke is the right combination of gentleness and reserve, while Mr. Dalton is brooding and outwardly gruff yet full of tender feelings. The minor roles are played well, too. <br />There's not much I can say about this production that hasn't already been said by the five other reviewers... Let me finish my review by urging you to buy this truly excellent film: if you love Charlotte Bronte's novel or even haven't yet read it, be assured that this is the most faithful and well-acted film adaptation available. It's a real treat that will be savored every time you watch it.

Sir Richard Grenville of the ship The Revenge, and his men fought heroically, against overwhelming odds. Instead of surrendering, they took on an entire fleet of Spanish ships, 15 ships to 1, 190 men to their 5,000, and fought bravely for over 15 hours to their certain death. Sir Richard Grenville is a well known historical figure who's story has inspired not only this song, but poems by Tennyson and Robert E. Howard.
B000002B5L|5.0|I agree that No Woman No cry wasn't a patch on the marley one, but it still ain't bad. The rest of the album is classic material, even the other copy's were very good, even if only for their lyrical content. My favorite tune on this was zealots.
B00004XONN|5.0|At the time of this writing, the cover of SPIN magazine poses the question - &quot;Radiohead: The World's Greatest Rock Band?&quot; I haven't read the article and I think this CD is amazing, but &quot;ROCK&quot; band? It seems so out of context. I associate the term &quot;rock&quot; with a certain range of '70's sounds. The only '70's sound that I would compare this to is maybe some of Brian Eno's more atmospheric/ambient stuff twisted by the desolate, lonely but lovely vocals of Thom Yorke. I guess this sound is so different they couldn't come up with a name for it. Nonetheless this CD is incredible.<br />Tracks 1 &amp; 6 (Everything In Its Right Place and Optimistic) are pop songs for the new millenium. If you haven't already heard them, tune in to your local &quot;alternative&quot; or college radio station. If they aren't already in heavy rotation, some program manager has his or her head up their proverbial arse. <br />Track 2 has the distorted vocals of someone giving birth to a new musical form on the moon. The only link to gravity is the soft insistence of the drums.<br />Track 3 - The National Anthem - is a wilderness of sound with caucophonous saxophones and other brass that manage to barely hang on to the song structure like improv jazz ala Critters Buggin' at their least melodic. It sounds like a bad night after too much coffee, cigarettes, computer dissonance at 3 am and you're exhausted and can't sleep. Yet it hangs together at the end.<br />You come down from this schizophrenia with Track 4 &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; which sounds like Thom Yorke floating alone in space with a guitar strumming in the background as he contemplatively prunes his bonsai bushes on a future space station mission. A few satellites whir quietly by and whiz out of range. Trumpets float in softly with a sound reminiscent of Miles Davis' &quot;Sketches of Spain.&quot; If you found &quot;fake plastic trees&quot; on &quot;The Bends&quot; a little too much like the bands America or Bread (I did), this song will make up for it. It will not get airplay due to its slow movement and complex song structure, but deserves to be heard and is a reason in itself to own the CD. Imagine Pink Floyd at their most contemplative, softest and quietly emotional. The deep emptiness of space with all its possibilities are in this song. <br />Track 5 - Treefingers - is like an Eno-esque rendition of a slow, warm sunrise soundscape.<br />Track 8 - Idioteque is a little bit of stripped down d&amp;b mixed with keyboard hiccups and eery Thom Yorke vocal loops that wind around each other, repeat and meet back up, creating another layer of rhythm. Unlike most of Radiohead's songs, the vocals in this one (Ice Age Comin' . Ice Age Comin' ... This is really happenin' ... Take the money and run...)lack the typical ballad structure of many of Radiohead's songs. Thom's voice is more instrument than narration, but contains social commentary and it's bouncy and catchy enough to sneak into your head and ramble around off and on throughout your day.<br />Compared to the rest of this CD, song #9 - Morning Bell - sounds positively sunny though it switches its moods delicately on and off in a light zephyr of sound.<br />Two final comments. First, the point to describing these (likely to be) lesser known tracks is because I fear that many people will take comments like &quot;pop music&quot; and &quot;not so weird&quot; to mean that it's mundane or similar to music you can find elsewhere. It's not. Though stripped down, many of the songs have subtle layerings, a comfortable groove, and a balance of the simple and complex. Second, while there are definite &quot;hits&quot; on this CD and songs that stand on their own, Kid A should also be appreciated as a whole and listened to in its entirety from beginning to end. If not, you risk missing the artistry, balance and emotional flow of this masterpiece.
B00004YM0D|5.0|&quot;Remember the Titians&quot; is a realistic feature that triggers a lot of emotions, and it demands a good soundtrack.  But good doesn't even do justice to this; GREAT is more like it1  You'll almost forget you're listening to a movie soundtrack, more like a typical recollection of 70's hits.  &quot;Aint No Mountain High Enough&quot; and &quot;Na Na Na Na&quot; steal the show; also noteable are &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot; and &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot;.  On another note completly, this is one of Disney's best soundtracks for a live action feature EVER--keep it up, Disney!  Usually, soundtracks for live-action movies just include instrullmental tracks, and don't appeal to many people as albums to purchase.  But this one ROCKS DOWN THE HOUSE!  I wish ALL of today's live action movies turned out such good music.  Don't you agree?
B00000K3UR|5.0|This is so coo! It's about an unresponsible 32 yr old played by Adam Sandler who wants to prove to his ex that dumped him for an older responsible man that he is ready to grow up. So, he adopts a 5 yr old boy Julian played by the adorable twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse. It's a great funny movie!
0783240236|5.0|The Birds is a wonderful movie with a lot of suspense. The DVD itself is very good, the documentary is very instructive and well made. Don't listen idiot people who complain about the extras of the DVD, watch the movie and the documentary instead.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Now I've been a fan of Limp since the beginning even before they became TRL main frames. Fred and crew rock hard and that's what they do on CSFHFW. Rollin' is just the coolest track around. The song pumps and while Fred's lyrics maybe not outstanding I don't care. The whole CD from the intro to Ben Stiller laughing at the end just is amazing. The tracks are pull of bumb and sweet vides. Top tracks My Generation, Rollin', Livin' it Up, Take a Look Around MI:2, Hold On. The only weak tracks are getcha groove on and well that's it. The songs no N'Together. But the Rollin' remix is SLAMMIN'!!!!! Fred, Meth, Red, DMX and Swizz beats throw together one hell of a track. Major props to Fred and crew Chocolate Starfish is off da HOOK!
B00003CXE7|1.0|I thought this was the most boring movie I had ever seen. I fell asleep to it twice. It seemed to move at the pace of 2 miles per hour. I defintely do not recommend this film.
B00004XONN|5.0|If not for the exceptionally beautiful and human indulged musical triumph that you can hear in each note in each song on this entire album, then buy Kid A simply because this world is too full of Britney and N'Sync bullcrap. Kid A comes at a time when the musical landscape is desolate and bleak, deluged with unimpressive lyrics and juvenile melodies. Remember when Nirvana came out and kicked that freak Michael Jackson and his equally freaky sister Janet off the charts? Wasn't that a glorious time? We all felt sooo good. It feels even better now. Thank God for Radiohead and thank the Heaven's for Kid A. Stylistically, the songs on here range from Aphex Twin and Mu-ziq inspired drill and bass to Sinatra-esque crooning. All the songs on Kid A have a delightful moral: humans rule. Regardless of the technology you hear on this album, you can't help but be reminded, somewhere in the song, that there are a pair of human hands twisting the knobs or pushing the keys.
0140186409|5.0|An extremely touching tale of a family seeking greener pastures, this book will surely change the way you look at big time capitalistic maneuvers. No denying that the big corporations brought the deadly efficiency and productivity to major markets, but in the face of all the success, one would tend to forget the millions of people who suffered for most of their lives to make way for the changes.<br />It also brings us up close to the situations during post-depression times which drove people to abject poverty and suffering. The kind of treatment the characters of the book undergo due to the policies of the rich landowners will surely make you shudder with shock. People can be so cruel at times to their own fellow beings that it is hard to comprehend the reasons behind such behavior!<br />Inspite of all the adversity, the characters in the book exude a level of endurance that is truly heartening. Anyone who reads this book will definitely face life's problems in a far more spirited and never-say-die manner. It definitely redefines one's conception of adversity and pain!<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the happenings which have moulded modern America. If not for the historical insight, this book is a fantastic journey into man's calibre to face challenges. One could read it just to discover the emotional strength of Ma in the Joad family. I am sure this is a book to be remembered for a lifetime!
0441172717|4.0|I think the fact that there are over 480 reviews of this book on Amazon.com, almost all of them 5 stars, tells you something - this book is one of the best-loved sci-fi books in existence, inspiring an almost cult-like following.  And no doubt Dune IS a fine work of epic fiction (\\"a cast of thousands\\"), but it is definitely not perfect, as many reviews would have you believe.   Let's start with the many positives: in Dune, Frank Herbert has created a complex, richly-textured, fascinating, internally consistent (for the most part), other world.  The world comes complete with it's own fascinating politics, economics, awareness of ecology (specifically, the importance of water), language (largely borrowed from Arabic), mythologies, good guys and bad guys (of course), heroes, traitors, etc.  And it's a rip-roaring story which is almost impossible to put down!<br />What you also get in Dune is a whole hodgepodge (sometimes confusing, sometimes ready to fly apart at the seams) of Zen-influenced philosophy, Machiavellian political intrigue (rival houses, the Emperor, CHOAM, the Bene Gesserit \\"witches\\", Mentats, spys, assassins, etc.), Arab-influenced desert culture and language, ecology, \\"planetology\\" (and Kynes, the Imperial planetologist) mysticism and religion aplenty, human psychology, a whole inter-galactic economic system (based on \\"spice\\"), and Star Wars-quality adventure.  Whether or not this all manages to hold together is a good question, and I basically (with reservations) think it does, this book is really not comparable to any other that I know of, exactly.  And things are not as \\"black and white\\" as they seem at first glance - although the Harkonnens ARE really nasty and the Atreides ARE really good (the Fremen and others tend to be far more ambiguous).  And of course, there is possibly Herbert's greatest creation, the giant sandworms (\\"makers\\"), and the precious \\"spice\\" produced by them without which the whole empire would fall apart.   Paul Atreides himselfis a smart, likeable, charismatic character, and is basically an excellent example of a the somewhat cliched \\"boy comes of age and grows into a man\\" character.  Actually, Paul's growth in this novel is not just from boy to man, but actually further, to something way beyond (almost superhuman), namely the Kwisatz Haderach - the man (can't be a woman, for somewhat obscure reasons which come awfully close to nonsensical psychobabble) who can see where others cannot, and who bridges space and time.  <br />I DO find the whole concept of being able to \\"see the future\\" fascinating the way Herbert presents it, not simplistically at all, but as a dynamic process whereby, like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the very act of observing something changes it.   In fact, Herbert's view of the future (and the past) is basically an incredibly complex set of possibilities converging at a nexus point (in Dune, it's mainly Paul Muad'Dib) and subject to change via the slightest move.  How does Paul remain sane with such knowledge and such a \\"terrible burden\\"?  How is he able to act and not remain paralyzed with fear when he knows that anything he does might unleash a galaxy-wide \\"jihad\\"?  That's all really interesting stuff, and Herbert generally handles it well.<br />Now here are the main problems (far fewer than the positives, and if you are one of the &quot;cult&quot; people, you might not want to read this!) with \\"Dune\\": 1) sometimes Herbert gets carried away with all the mystical/philosophical mumbo-jumbo and jargon (seems brilliant when you're 16, sort of like \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", but give it a couple of decades and see what you think then!); 2) Herbert sometimes forgets that his characters are just people, not superbeings, which I think makes them less believable and harder to relate to (unlike, let's say, Frodo in the Lord of the Rings); 3) all of the plot twists -- the \\"feints within feints within feints\\" can at times get a little confusing/tedious, even after multiple readings; 4) all this \\"terrible purpose\\" stuff can get annoying and a little over-the-top and silly at times (sometimes I feel like saying &quot;c'mon Frank, lighten up a little bit!&quot;); and 5) Herbert is an adequate, but certainly not a great prose stylist.  <br />But, all that said (cultists can start to read again now), Dune is still an excellent book and well worth reading, probably several times, each time on a different level (there are many here in this multi-layered book). Definitely DON'T waste your time on the awful movie (unless you're a big Sting fan), and also I would say avoid the sequels as well (I've read most of them).  Frank Herbert had one first-rate (despite its flaws) book in him, and this is the one!  Essential reading for any sci-fi fan.
0671027344|5.0|Not only does this book let you into a life of an unknown person, it lets you into your own life. After reading this book before my senior year started (a few months back...) I realized I really needed too - and wanted to change things. This book shows how the little everyday things you do, DO MATTER. And how you can outcome anything with friends. Good solid friends. I can't explain it, but this book has been on of the few that has kissed my soul...very tenderly. I think every child should read this in highschool. It shows your everyday struggles and lusts for life. To be...you is the key. This book will help.
B00004U2A2|5.0|This movie was certainly interesting. My friends and I had to watch it a couple of times to actually get the full affect. Bruce Campbell's performance as &quot;Ash&quot; our, unlikely hero, is truly a credit to acting! The only thing is that it was just a remake of the first one! It seemingly took place afer the first Evil Dead, but everything happen again, and in the same order! But, despite that, it was truly a great movie. Not really a true horror film, but definately scary.
0446677450|3.0|The author got rich investing in realestate and now thinks he knows all the answers.  He recommends that you quit your job and never work for someone else.  Brian Tracy in The Pyschology of Achievement recommends learning a specialized skill, becoming an expert at it, saving your money and you have a good chance of becoming wealthy.  The author recommends that you go into business for yourself (but then points out that a huge percentage of businesses fail.) He also misrepresents tax rules - he says that if you form a corporation, you can deduct personal expenses legally through the corporation.  This is not the case -cars and other expenses that are not for corporate use are taxed to an individual as compensation (or should be).  He stresses financial literacy but really doesn't seem to have the basics down. The author refers to a house as a liabiltiy (and I think he really believes it) Houses are indeed assets (mortgages are liabilities and so is my credit card bill for buying this book)
0345350499|1.0|I read this book as a member of a book club.  It is very long, 900+ pages and I did not find it worth the effort. Other women in my club really liked it, but I found it depressing and dark.  Life is too short to struggle through a book like this - there are other great things to read.
0380002930|5.0|This is not some cutesy kids book about talking rabbits. This is a thoroughly engrossing, mature, novel; every bit as detailed and well-written as Tolkein's The Hobbit. It has all the makings of a classic: myths, folk tales, characters you care about, and wonderful descriptive language.<br />Watership Down follows the tale of a group of rabbits fleeing from their warren after Fiver--a young rabbit--has a vision of disaster. Hazel (the leader), Bigwig (the loyal fighter), Dandelion (the bright storyteller), Fiver (the prophetic runt), Blackberry (the creative problem-solver), and others must travel farther than they've ever gone before to find a new home. Even when the rabbits discover a near nirvana, they still have dangers to face.<br />A fast-paced, beautifully crafted novel, Watership Down will linger in your memory long after many books are forgotten.
B000002UVZ|5.0|This album came from deep in the Reagan Era. For that generation of college radio listeners, it may just help you remember how much fun this music was and how good it still sounds today. It is upbeat, loud and fun. Life's Rich Pageant helped push this band into broader popularity, while it contains the raw edge of the first IRS Collections. It contains some of the best of this band, before they became mainstream and serious.
0767903854|5.0|Whilst I was in New York the other day a friend gave me this book.That is strange I thought( I am an Australian, why would someone want to give me a book about Australia ). I read it on the plane on the way home - well what else is there to do when flying for 20 hours. I was surprised - Bill Bryson told me things about my own country , some of which I didn't know &amp; a lot which I take for granted but which I never understood visitors to this Island/continent/country may not know about. For anyone planning to visit AussieLand I thoroughly recommend this book and also to Australians to get a visitors perspective of our great land.
B00000FCBC|4.0|I think that this is one of their best releases. My favorite is the Mercyful Fate Medley. I love the way they remade Satans Fall(I listen to Mercyful Fate also). Other good ones on the medley are Curse Of the Pharohs and Evil. Other good ones are Sabbra Cadabra, It's Electric(I am a fan of Diamond Head), Free Speech For The Dumb, Tuesdays Gone, Helpless, Last Caress, Am I Evil?, Blitzreig, and So What. Let Me tell you this though, do not listen to the small hours. I don't know why but I hate it. Stone Cold Crazy isn't so good either. Oh by the way don't listen to Loverman, or don' Well let me just say this the ones I listed above are the Best so listen to em.
0446677450|3.0|Very provocative book about the beginnings of financial guru Robert Kiyosaki.  Its best value is the fact that it provides a very different point of view when it comes to prosperity.  It also proves how important it is to educate children in financial issues from a very early age.  This is a valuable book if you are trying to learn more about personal finance.  I don't like the self-promotion of CashFlow Technologies throughout the book, and i think there are cheaper ways to learn about your finances than by buying an expensive game, but overall the book is interesting, reads quickly and more importantly, gives you a different way to look at money.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|Every so often a film comes along that so completely fulfills the demands of its genre that all such films that come after it seem to be little more than pale imitations in comparison.  Such a film is the 1981 German classic, \\"Das Boot,\\" undoubtedly the gold-standard against which all other submarine sagas must - fairly or unfairly - inevitably be measured.  Since that film pretty much exhausted the great humanistic themes of brotherhood and survival to be found in this category of films, the American submarine films that have come afterwards - \\"The Hunt For Red October,\\" \\"Crimson Tide,\\" and now, \\"U-571\\" - have been forced to turn to high level suspense plotting to supplement the standard genre conventions.  Each of these films has its moments but, the truth be told, one ends up invariably comparing these pieces of pulp entertainment to a genuine work of cinematic art - and there is just no comparison.<br />In a way, this genre, more than virtually any other, suffers from the cramped restrictions of its underwater setting.  There just isn't a lot to DO in a submarine and, hence, the directors of these films are obviously very limited in the way they can approach the material both visually and dramatically.  Thus, we are subjected to the endless tight close-ups on the men's worried, perspiring faces as they cast their eyes upward and strain their ears during the inevitable depth-charge and how-low-can-they-go-before-they-break-apart sequences.  We know that, before long, we will be watching that needle moving precariously into the red zone on the depth gauge, followed by the customary popping bolts, creaking hull and spouting water mains as the ship challenges the limits of its diving capabilities.  (Not one of these subs, in the history of the movies, by the way, has ever failed this test).  To get a little visual action into the picture, the cinematographer will, at some point or other, begin shaking the camera chaotically to simulate exploding depth charges a mere stone's throw from the ship's egg-like outer shell.<br />Unable to even approach \\"Das Boot\\"s cinematic and technical expertise, \\"U-571\\" attempts to generate excitement with its action movie plotting and ambiance.  Regrettably, neither the story nor the characters in this film are particularly engaging.  Mathew McConaughey stars as Lt. Andrew Tyler, a naval officer who manages, through a complicated series of partly planned, partly inadvertent circumstances, to lead a group of men on board a German u-boat, kill most of its crew and cruise around the North Atlantic in a Trojan Horse type operation, while uncovering the German codebook they have been sent to find on the ship.  Unlike \\"Das Boot,\\" whose primary concern was to make its recreation of life aboard a sub as realistic and convincing as possible, \\"U-571\\" loses its way in a welter of action film histrionics, cardboard cutout characters and maudlin sentimentality.  Taylor is supposed to be a second-rate, overly-sensitive officer whom the bigwigs trust so little that they refuse to assign him a boat and a command of his own - but do we doubt, that by finale time, he will have proven himself to be a leader in the true-blue military tradition?  None of the characters in this film seem to differentiate themselves from one another in any way that would make us care about them.  They all seem to be, essentially, a group of dressed-up actors playing at soldier - a far cry from the fully fleshed-out and convincing set of characters that comprised Wolfgang Peterson's crew.<br />Perhaps it is unfair to judge \\"U-571\\" in relation to that earlier epic work.  (After all, \\"Das Boot\\" runs several hours longer than this film).  Nevertheless, it is a measure of the true greatness of that incomparable German masterpiece that it literally left nothing for future films to add to the genre.  It is all there in that one work - complete and perfect in its artistry and form.  Very few films sum up their genres as consummately as Wolfgang Peterson's \\"Das Boot.\\"ang Peterson's \\"Das Boot.\\"
B00004XOWM|3.0|Let's make this one simple. All the ignorant fans who think that this is Limp Bizkit's greatest album out of the three. Do me and the World a favor and wake up! This is by far not the best Limp album, not even Significant Other.. 3 Dolla Bill Ya'll is by far the best Limp Bizkit album to date. Now.. I still do like Significant Other and Chocolate Starfish.. these two albums are done fairly well. .. And a point to those who call bands like Limp, Korn, Metallica and other rock bands quote &quot;sell outs&quot;. Can you honestly say bands like these have sold out simply because they try new tunes.. and new ways to do their music? No you can't.. all you arrogant fools better realize how many bands in this World are sell outs to you. Because pretty much every group out their has tried new stuff.. GET OVER IT!<br />Now, to the Chocolate Starfish. The title of the album just makes you want to buy it and see what lurks inside this piece of plastic. The two releases singles, &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Rollin'&quot; were nice ways to get the fans hyped up for the album. But to be honest.. this could of been much better if they waited a little bit longer to perfect the songs and possibly write some new and better lyrics. Fred's lyrics are very simple and easy to comprehend, not that it's a bad thing. But he needs more originality. Although this album does have it's high points. Me, being more of a rap based fan.. you will love the tracks &quot;Gethcha Groove On&quot; with XZibit.. and the &quot;Rollin'&quot; remix featuring DMX, Method Man and Redman.. who are all three talented MC's in the business.. much better than Fred will ever be. &quot;Hot Dog&quot;, &quot;Full Nelson&quot;, &quot;Livin' It Up&quot;, &quot;Take a Look Around&quot; and &quot;It'll be Okay&quot; are your best best for good songs. But, I guess &quot;My Way&quot; is also an okay tune. To make this simple.. and in terms you ignorant people will understand. Limp Bizkit is a good band.. I'll give themthat. But in terms of creativity and patience to make their music what it once was.. GOOD. They need to work on that one.. it's not a must.. but if you are a die hard IGNORANT fan of Limp Bizkit.. then buy it for all I care. Just don't expect anything special.
6300213668|5.0|I know this movie through my Sec 2 performance, cos we used &quot;We go together&quot; as our song for the dance.It's really a sweet memories to me.It's full meaning.I feel so touch after watching as it descibes how those charators faced the problems yet this doesn't discourage them inspite giving them the couragous.How I wish I can like them, having a happy ending.
6305075379|1.0|Don't buy this Video. With DVD technology it would have been a no-brainer to provide both sound tracks, the original Aussie version and the rotten American dubbed version. These dopes chose to give us the one that nobody wants. Perhaps if nobody buys it they'll get a clue.
6304539487|4.0|This Anime is an excellent, thrilling ride. The animation is out of this world. Each and every detail is put into each action scene making it almost realistic. The Plot goes without saying to be most intense and mind boggling. Down side is the voices in the dubbed are kind of without expression. They kind of flatline it. I was also dissapointed by the length of the film. Anyone who see's this might feel that some of the happening's in the movie are left unexplained. Some people on the other hand might like the idea of making up the untold part of the story. But dont make my opinion your base for buying this film. To me it is truely excellent, Next to Akira and Neon Genisis Evangelion(even though its storyline is carrried on through 13 tapes). Buy it. You'll like it.

I guess I was hoping for something different....a HAPPY ending!! it would have been the best book ever *almost!* if the ending had just been more like what I wanted to happen, in my opinion.
0679879269|5.0|Harry Potter? C.S. Lewis? Tolkein? Pullman puts them all to shame, working the magic for a third time with the Amber Spyglass. Ghosts, ghouls, angels, witches, bears, and that evil golden daemon are back again, as Pullman catapults us in to a world (worlds) very different than our own, but eerily parallel. Will, Lyra, and the bulk of the characters from the first two books are back, more developed and lovable than ever, and as determined as before to give us an amazing story. With its theological implications, its amazingly detailed plotlines, and its grand theme of how the simplest things have the most profound consequences, this book is without a doubt worthy of sharing a trilogy with its predecessors. It remains to be seen if this amazing epic will be read by millions, but for those who do read it, you will be as happy as a mulefa (read the book). Eric
B000002J1M|5.0|.... long, long ago (okay, we're talking early '70s, so maybe not THAT long), an uppity bunch of European rock enthusiasts, mostly college buddies, introduced us culturally starved Western yahoos to a new realm of music which became known as Progressive.  It broke away from the standard of much popular stuff of that day, incorporating elements of jazz, classical, and generally abstract deviance from your basic 4/4, 1-4-5 blues progressions that permeated a musical form which, back then, only got really exciting whenever somebody took an extended solo.  And sometimes even that didn't work ......<br />Enter Genesis.  A five-piece, electro-symphonic ensemble fronted by Peter Gabriel, a quirky storyteller who shaved the middle of his head and dressed up in nightmarish costumes.  On the surface that would seem a cheap gimmick.  Then you really listen to the music.  The opening, soaring chords of Watcher of the Skies suggest anything from a panoramic view of a vast canyon to hurtling through space at the speed of infinity.  The song relates the tale of your everyday God-Man who is doomed to witness the folly of mortal beings as they come and go over the ages, with no recourse but to ponder on the meaning of it all.  Timetable diminishes the energy level, brings us a bit more down to acoustic Earth, with the melancholy observation &quot;Why must we suffer each race to believe that no race has been grander?  It seems because through time and space, though names may change, each face retains the mask it wore.&quot;<br />Get 'Em Out By Friday envisions a society which imposes a four-foot restriction on humanoid height - we're running out of all that time and space!  Can-Utility and the Coastliners (an enigmatic title if there ever was one) leaves the listener with the impression that mortal leaders, whether political, holy or whatever, are ultimately born to disillusion and disappoint; &quot;See the little man with his face turning red!  Though his story's often told, you can tell that he's dead&quot;  And we are once again the Watcher, overseeing the folly of it all.  End of Act One.<br />Act Two starts off with a serene, melodic view of further &quot;Horizons&quot;, a solo guitar watercolor sketch of the promise of a new day, a new vision born of the previous disillusioning images of societal ruination.  And just as we've digested the resonance of the final gentle chord ...... Supper's Ready.  This 23-minute work is a seven-course Apocalypse served hot, so bring a hearty appetite and remember to activate your prayer capsule.  This significant piece epitomizes what the group Genesis was all about (emphasis on WAS), runs the gamut of earthly view through all the absurd distortions that reality can manifest, pulverizes it entirely when all the Antichrists of the ages get together to party in 9/8 (yes you CAN dance to that beat) before flinging the doors open to a blinding white warm Heaven, the promise of illuminating our true way home.<br />No, this is not just another normal rock album.  Not even for Genesis.  It is hard to believe nowadays that they used to be THIS group.  I think these guys really died and were replaced by impostors.  No matter.  The fact is, FOXTROT got recorded, it is a work like no other, the kind of album one listens to when they want something not as background music, not as lifesyle reinforcement, but as literature.  It is The Bible as written by Lewis Carroll, set to the music of, oh, Ravel or Stravinsky, played on guitars (Steve Hackett, Michael Rutherford), drums (Phil Collins), and '70s state-of-the-art electronic keybords (Tony Banks).  And like progressive rock in general, it's not for everyone ..... just the few true Watchers.  Like Yes' &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, it is a journey.  Indispensable Genesis, with a very visible touch.  You could almost forgive Phil Collins for his reworking of &quot;Groovy Kind of Love&quot; ......n tell that he's dead&quot;  And we are once again the Watcher, overseeing the folly of it all.

B00004X01U|4.0|Okay, when I first got the album and played it, I really didn't like it. Upon repeated listenings, it grew on me. If you're expecting more of the soul searching that was on &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, then be prepared: this is NOT that album. This is more like Madonna does bubblegum pop... only exploring a genre of music which still hasn't really crossed over into the mainstream. There's a bit of techno on the album and perhaps too &quot;interesting&quot; for an older more conservative listening audience. It's not as toned down as the music on her last album. It's got more pure techno on it.<br />There is one song that I guess has a message &quot;What It Feels Like For a Girl&quot; which is a great number.<br />One of the best numbers on the album is &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; which reminds me of &quot;Thief of Hearts&quot; from the Erotica album. Only difference is I didn't really like the &quot;Thief of Hearts&quot; song but like &quot;Runaway Lover&quot;.<br />Then, there's &quot;Amazing&quot; which is very much like &quot;Drowned Kingdom&quot; from Ray of Light meets &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot;. This is, by far, my favorite track on the album.<br />The song &quot;Music&quot; is great! The rest of the material on this album is either fair or okay or passable.<br />Still, if you're a Madonna fan, it's worth getting.
B00000J6AG|4.0|I'm not a techno fan.  As a matter of fact I dislike most of that stuff.  I know this isn't true ultra-orthodox techno, but it's techno enough.  This CD is fantastic.<br />For years I've heard about Moby's genius (even from people that don't like this kind of music), but was always a little hesitant of buying one of his records for the simple fact that I'm not too keen on this genre.  <br />Well, as one of the naysayers, I must humble myself and proclaim brilliance on the part of Moby!  My brother loaned this to me a while a go and it hasn't left my player since.  As a matter of fact when he wanted it back, I went out that very evening and purchased it for myself.<br />&quot;Run On&quot; is my favorite track on the album.  Its got that great mixture of groove and gospel.  Its amazing how he seamlessly weaves styles so disparate as gospel and techno.  &quot;Porcelain&quot; is a splendid track as well.  The floaty, ethereal, whispy drift is addictive.  &quot;South Side&quot; has a loose vibe and makes for some good driving music.  <br />Some moments are less glimmering than others (hence the 4 stars instead of 5.)  It is, however, one of the best popular albums to be released in years (when I say &quot;popular&quot; I'm referring to non-folk and non-classical forms.)
B00004X0Q0|2.0|i wouldnt really say these guys are from el paso anymore. i mean its safe to say that they really arent going to claim recedency there again. this album only has about 5 good songs. 1,2,3,4,10. but even those seem like they are going to wear thin on me in time to come. cedrics lyrics are laughable sometimes and the album in general is overproduced. try not to get me wrong im extremely proud of these guys. i just think they should try to start from scratch on their new album. and please cedric i hear you're a big a coke head. try to cut it out and dont scream so much. i was showing one these songs to my father and he just laughed and shook his head. over time i understood more and more why he laughed.
B000000WF0|4.0|I really like this album, great and powerful songs like &quot;the drugs dont work&quot;, &quot;sonnet&quot;, &quot;bittersweet Symphony&quot;, and &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, these songs is my biggest favourites on this record. Strong songs about the real things in life. About money, about love, and about the bad things whith drugs, and about to be yourself, and how good that is, and to feel lucky. Its deep melancholic, real, pure poprock music, whith a little blues in. Its too bad that the band split up. But Richard Ashcrofts solo-career is very good, he is always making good music, whith other musicians. The album &quot;alone whith everybody&quot; is a great album. Good title to. &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; is a great album of the 90s, their best record, whith no doubt. Good lyrics, good instrumental music. A great teamwork between all this. Its a very emotionell record, and that cant be wrong, Hes soloalbum is also good on similar ways. &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; is a solid album. And there is also good videos to all of Richards songs. Its great storytelling music, and it gives the right emotions about to feel free and to feel good whith relating to the lyrics/music. Its like this whith favouritemusic, including other bigger favouritegroups for me.And its on similar ways for other people. Its great music. So it cant be wrong to buy this kind of music. Its worth the money. / Bye.
B00000APLB|5.0|A previous review has the Stones performing at a club in Montreal.The club was the EL Macombo in Toronto, Canada.They performed at the club prior to performing thier stadium show in Toronto.Anyone who knows this club will tell you this is where rock bands in Toronto played during those years, something like the Fillmore clubs in San Francisco and Philly.This is the Stones at there best, a must have cd with a raw sound that does not sound contrived, get it and listen to the EL Macombo side you will love it.
B000002C25|3.0|This album is not so great as &quot;What´s the story morning glory&quot;, but &quot;Be here now&quot; has some really great tracks, mostly &quot;Stand by me&quot;, and &quot;All around the world&quot;, the other tracks is not so good, but they are good enough. Definetly Maybe is the third best album, thats my opinion. I´m not a big Oasis-fan, but i like many tracks of them. A good group on lyrics and instrumental rockmusic. They´re not so much better live then in the studio. Gallaghers is sometimes some real badguys, whith much trouble around themselves, mostly unnecessery. Liam has a voice which oasis need, but i like Noel better, cos he is the man who´s making the good storys in the songs, and good on guitar to. And not so agressive as Liam. The best songs of them is &quot;Supersonic&quot;, &quot;Some might say&quot;, &quot;Wonderwall&quot;, &quot;Don´t look back in anger&quot;, &quot;Stand by me&quot;, &quot;All around the world&quot;, and &quot;Go let it out&quot;. These songs has also good videos. I miss Noel on vocals on many songs. I hope he´s gonna do a solocareer. Good lyrics and instrumental play in these songs. &quot;What´s the story...&quot; sold very much in the year -95-96, one of the most bestselling brittisch records ever, but...ten years before, it was &quot;brothers In Arms&quot; by Dire Straits. And Brothers In Arms is a much better record, from a much better group,and it was a bigger bestseller to, and is still going strong enough. so there is no competition there.<br />The last realease by Oasis, &quot;Standing on the...&quot; is a bad record, whith a N.Y picture on, and i don´t know why they have that picture on the album.  But &quot;Be here now&quot; is a very good album, so if you are a fan of Oasis, then you must have this one. /thanks.
B00004XQP4|5.0|There &quot;classic rock&quot; record, Or so says Gutiar world magazine. I dident have any other records, I lost them years ago. Ive bought them all again. This album is very good except for a few things. Before I bring out the negitive, lemme talk about the songs. WARNING- is a good song, acoustic. And is the first glimse of the fall of Tre as a drummer, which I will mention later. I like it, it is catchy. BLOOD, SEX AND BOOZE- This sounds closer to something from in my opinon there best album Nimrod(well tied with Isomniac). Its more of a rock song, then most of the rest. A highlight. CHURCH ON SUNDAY- This is probly my favorite song on the album. Great chorus, and great song writing. But of course Tre, is missing, I will mention later. FASHION VICTIM- One of the more average songs on the album. Basic rift, with a good chourus. The not great production, and not so great drums, keep parts of the song from shining. CASTAWAY- A good song. The closest song to punk on the album. A new turn of punk for green day. Good everything. MISERY- Youv read reviews about this song. With the madelion and the other greek sounds. Great song. So far 5 out of 6 songs are worth-while. DEADBEAT HOLIDAY- somewhat amusing lryics,and a great chorus. Drums and production at another low. But still great. HOLD ON- good lryics, but bad drums keep this from beging spectacular Still great , but not as good as it could be. JACKASS- somewhat punk, more production problems, still good. Waiting- They played this on the mtv concert special. It sounded much better live then on the album, specially the drums. MINORITY- you heard it already. MACY'S DAY PARADE- very good song. A balad, and very peaceful.<br />Tre sucks at druming on this album!, horrible sounded snare durms. Still the positive side is that, every song sounds different.
B00004U9LT|5.0|My three-year old has been enchanted by the Snowman video since he first saw it.  It is very refreshing to find a children's video that is not annoying, preachy, or pure commercialism.  His father and I actually enjoy watching &quot;Snowman&quot; with him, and our son has not gotten tired of it in over a year.  With superb sound and lovely animation, it is a must for every child's video library!
0679879269|5.0|Despite a slower paced beginning,The Amber Spyglass had a masterful conclution bursting with emotion.  All of the loose ends and ideas that had been hanging from the first two books were sumed up beautifuly.  Although I finished it a few days ago I'm still haveing trouble getting over the ending which was really really sad. It makes the book more powerful than a &quot;happily ever after&quot; but still.  My only real  critisisim to the book is the amber spyglass itself.  Unlike the golden compass and the subtle knife, it had very little relevence to the main plot.  Still this is just a minor critisisim and the book more than reached my expectations.  Its somewhat sad that this is also the last book in the series, because it means that I will not be able to read more about the characters.  However, a fourth book would seem somewhat inapproipiate.
0156421178|5.0|George Orwell went to Spain in late 1936, in his role as a journalist, but then, pretty inevitably, put  down his pen and spent the next year fighting with the P.O.U.M (Partido Obrero de Unificacion  Marxista) Militia against the Fascist forces under Francisco Franco.  Homage to Catalonia, written  immediately after his return and published in 1938, tells the story of his military service with the  POUM, both against the Right and the Left, and, in quick succession, of his initial hopes for the  classless society that he thought he had found on first arrival, then of his disappointment with the level  of disorganization of the Leftist forces and finally of his disillusionment when pro-Stalinist &quot;allies&quot;  began attacking Socialists and Anarchists who refused to toe the Soviet line.  Orwell, who by then had  nearly been killed when shot through the neck in battle, and his wife were ultimately forced to flee  from Spain, to avoid Stalinist security forces, which had labeled him pro-fascist.<br />The one thing, more than any other, that makes Orwell one of the great literary and cultural figures of  the 20th Century, is that it was this last fact that truly galled him.  Orwell was committed to the idea of  revolutionary Socialism.  As he says when the security forces attack POUM:<br />  I have no particular love for the idealized 'worker' as he appears in the bourgeois Communist's  mind, but when I see an actual flesh-and-blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the  policeman, I do not have to ask myself which side I am on.<br />He was fueled by an animus towards the class system which is almost incomprehensible to us  Americans, but which came naturally to young British intellectuals, particularly in the wake of the First  World War.  Accordingly, he was not unsympathetic to the Soviet decision that they had to take over  the Left in Spain; in his revolutionary heart, he could understand that such a maneuver, however brutal  might eventually serve the greater cause of the Workers.  No, what he could not tolerate was that the  perpetrators and their fellow travelers in the Press lied about it.  It is the essence of the man that being  purged was tolerable, but having his political beliefs portrayed incorrectly was intolerable.<br />Orwell's concern for honest language is easy to discern in 1984 (see Orrin's review) and Animal Farm  (see Orrin's review) once you know to look for it, but it is first evident here.  He recognized early on  that one of the ways in which dictators would attack freedom was to degrade the language and by  cheapening the meaning of words, deaden the emotional reaction of the citizenry to events.  Prescient  in so many ways, Orwell was never more correct than when he made this connection between the  integrity of language and the integrity of the men using it.  One can only imagine a profile of Bill  Clinton as written by Orwell.<br />The Spanish Civil War is second only to the Hitler/Stalin pact as a dividing line between mere  Left-Wingers and genuine Communists.  It was here that the true nature of the Soviet Union first  intruded itself upon the public consciousness to such a degree that its defenders truly had to be  considered apologists, not simply naive do-gooders.  Orwell, objective and honest as always, wrote  only about what he saw, so his portrayal of events is necessarily incomplete and, writing while the  conflict was still going on, he was not able to form the really harsh judgments that our historical  perspective allows us to make.  But it is to his great good credit that he wrote what he did and when he  did.  Many of his brethren on the Left refused to do so for fear of hurting &quot;the cause&quot;.  Orwell chose to  tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may; for that alone he should be celebrated.<br />GRADE: Aserve the greater cause of the Workers.

0790729725|3.0|Imagine a movie where you get so caught up that you want for it never to end.  Goodfellas is that movie, I my opinion it's better than The Godfather, because this injects a slightly more humorous side to the tale of Harry Hill and his Mafia pals.<br />However just as you think the dvd is running well, the screen goes blank and you have to flip the disc over.  Surely Warners coud release a special edition of this movie and keep it all on one side.  I've awarded this movie 3 stars because the movie is still powerful it's just annoying that Warners looked at the cheap opinion of manufactuer on this wonderful movie.
0156347113|1.0|The outstanding faults of the economic society in which we live are its failure to provide for full  employment and its arbitrary and inequitable distribution of wealth and incomes.  -Conclusion to The General Theory<br />With these two assertions--the first dubious, the second simply wrong--John Maynard Keynes unleashed  the most terrifying period of government expansion and social experimentation in the history of  Western Man.  Keynes basic argument was that the boom/bust cycle of the economy was inevitable and  that government should intervene to dampen both the peaks (via confiscatory taxation) and the valleys  (via deficit spending).  The goal being to guarantee full employment and to redistribute wealth.  Now,  it's understandable that the generation of men who faced the Depression were driven to propose some  aggressive solutions, but if we have to choose one, this is the moment when Western Man blinked.  Keynes basically abandoned a two century old faith in the efficacy of capitalism and proposed that  laissez-faire be replaced by the firm hand of government.<br />The ensuing fifty years saw virtually every nation of the West surrender increasing control of the  economy to the government, accept extortionate tax rates, pile up staggering deficits, and, all the while,  spiral farther and farther into the abyss.  The Keynesian Revolution brought the West to its knees  before Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan seized back control and began the long, and as we speak  uncertain, process of returning power to the marketplace.<br />Interestingly enough, while the Left remains in thrall to his thoroughly discredited theories, it seems  that Keynes himself might have been one of the first to abandon his own handiwork (this after all was a  man who ditched the Bloomsbury Group and homosexuality when he fell in love with a ballerina), had  he lived to see the disaster it was producing.  In the conclusion to his book he states:<br />  ...the ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are  wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood.  Indeed the world is ruled by little else.  Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are  usually the slaves of some defunct economist.  Madmen in authority, whom hear voices in the air,  are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.  I am sure that the  power of vested interests is vastly exaggerated compared with the gradual encroachment of ideas.  Not, indeed, immediately, but after a certain interval; for in the field of economic and political  philosophy there are not many who are influenced by new theories after they are twenty-five or  thirty years of age, so that the ideas which civil servants and politicians and even agitators apply to  current events are not likely to be the newest.  But, soon or late, it is ideas, not vested interests,  which are dangerous for good or evil.<br />While his theories proved to be catastrophic, this paragraph is not only accurate, it proved to be  prophetic.  The real nadir, the West's point of greatest danger, came about twenty five or thirty years  into the Revolution, when Richard Nixon abandoned the fight against Keynes and embraced the welfare  state.  With the last line of defense nearly routed, Goldwater, Reagan and the like were lonely voices  crying in the wilderness, the final crack up came &amp; by the late 70's people were talking about malaise  and the failure of democracy and all kinds of defeatist twaddle.  We were fortunate that folks were  desperate enough to finally take a chance on the Iron Lady and the Gipper.  Likewise, we are living  through the first generation of the return to markets.  Clinton could have been a significant historical  figure had he had the courage of his supposed convictions and dragged the New Democrats over to the  side of individual freedom and limited government.  As it is, the ideais still being fought by the Left  and we will see if the eventual result is a return to big government, or the kind of stasis we've achieved  now, with government growing, but slowly, or whether there is a Democrat on the horizon who has the  stature and vision to lead the party back to the future.<br />Hopefully, Keynes was right and the power of the idea of freedom ensures its eventual victory.  But, it  must be acknowledged, Keynes General Theory was one of the greatest threats to our freedom that we  have ever weathered.  This book was a source of great evil in this century and Keynes must shoulder a  significant portion of the blame for the sorry state of the West circa 1978-79.<br />GRADE: Ffreedom and limited government.

B000002I2M|5.0|L.A. Woman is a classic of a classic song, and also the best song on the album. The rest of the album is very good, too. But, the title track really is one of the best tunes ever. What I like was the fact that there was a change of pace on these songs. Prior Doors songs seemed to have too much keyboard or seemed too slow and winding. The guys picked up the pace on this one and it shows. Jim Morrison sounds great when he sings in an angry tone and really belts out the lyrics here. He truly should be considered one of the great rock singers in history. L.A. Woman is a testament to that.
0553275569|5.0|As to just what this ineffable quality was. . .well, it obviously involved bravery. But it was not  bravery in the simple sense of being willing to risk your life. . .any fool could do that. . . . No, the  idea. . .seemed to be that a man should have the ability to go up in a hurtling piece of machinery and  put his hide on the line and then have the moxie, the reflexes, the experience, the coolness, to pull it  back in the last yawning moment--and then to go up again the next day, and the next day, and every  next day. . . . There was a seemingly infinite series of tests. . .a dizzy progression of steps and  ledges. . .a pyramid extraordinarily high and steep; and the idea was to prove at every foot of the  way up that pyramid that you were one of the elected and anointed ones who had the right stuff and  could move higher and higher and even--ultimately, God willing, one day--that you might be able to  join that special few at the very top, that elite who had the capacity to bring tears to men's eyes, the  very Brotherhood of the Right Stuff itself.  -Tom Wolfe, The Right Stuff<br />I don't know whether Tom Wolfe invented New Journalism or merely noticed that it was aborning,  even he would probably credit Truman Capote's In Cold Blood, but he's certainly one of the greatest  practitioners and The Right Stuff one of his greatest achievements.  The essence of this &quot;new&quot; writing  style was that non-fiction writers would write with a distinct authorial voice and would utilize the  techniques of the novel.  Most importantly,  rather than having the story exist solely to convey facts,  the facts were to serve the story.  This allowed the writer some license to play with reality a little, as  long as the story remained &quot;true&quot; and it allowed the writer to aim for telling big truths, those which  would frequently lie beyond the perspective of a conventional story.<br />All of these innovations are brilliantly on display here.  Every paragraph of the book reeks of Tom  Wolfe, from the capitalization of certain concepts (it not just the right stuff, it's The Right Stuff) to the  snarky jabs at myriad puffed up targets.  By using the structure of a novel, he gives the story a  conceptual coherence that straight reportage might not have offered--thus, he starts with Yeager and the  first supersonic jets, then presents the story of the Mercury program, then returns to Yeager and the end  of the effort to build jets that would actually have traveled into space.  All of this seems uniquely suited  to satire or parody or simply viscious attack, indeed, Wolfe has used the stylistic conventions of New  Journalism for just these purposes in books like &quot;Radical Chic&quot; and &quot;Bauhaus to Our House&quot; to brilliant  effect.  But an interesting thing happens in The Right Stuff.  Even though we hear that snide voice  trying to speak out periodically, Wolfe is so smitten by the jet pilots and astronauts and their wives that  he writes about, that these devices are turned on their collective head and they become the  accouterments of a kind of conscious, but unabashed, myth making.<br />In the end, the book becomes a sort of American Ring of the Nibelungen or Iliad.  I remember when  Philip Kaufman's movie version came out, people were a little disconcerted by the stylized  story-telling, but it seemed to me that he had handled the material exactly right, like the libretto for a  Grand Opera.  As a newish country and a fairly secular one, we don't have many myths or fables (with  the notable exception of the Western), but what Tom Wolfe serves up here, is a quintessential  American epic, complete with archetypes and leitmotifs and the lot.  By looking back at the &quot;real&quot;  events through the lens of his book, we can actually penetrate to truths about our culture and our  national character that would not have been apparent in a straightforward history of the Space Program.<br />This is a great book and Wolfe is one of our greatest writers.<br />GRADE: A+s one of our greatest writers.<br />GRADE: A+
B000002H33|5.0|&quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is probably the best album by Metallica. It starts out strong and ends strong. Why anybody wouldn't like this album is beyond my understanding. This is old Metallica, the best Metallica. Sadly, I have to say, that Metallica has sold-out (especially now that they're suing Napster, my favorite program!) Oh, well, at least I can still enjoy their music. <br />The first part of this CD is the best part. When I first listened to it I thought, &quot;Wow! This is true talent!&quot; Compared to many of the bands today, Metallica is Jimi Hendrix (although their not really THAT good). They play fast (I mean fast) riffs combined with a booming bass, provided by the late Cliff Burton, and the awesome drumming by Lars. Lars, especially proves his talent. He drums at amazingly fast speeds and changes down to a slower beat instantly, and that is not easy to do. I can play both guitar and drums, and I can play almost every song on this album on both instruments, and let me tell you, it's a challenge. I listen to this album about wonce a month, at least!<br />The album starts with &quot;Battery&quot;, which is just wonderful. I love the beginning part of the song, where the acoustic is playing, then the lead kicks in, and then a third guitar, and then all of a sudden, the distortion kicks in. I give that song a 4 1/2 (out of 5).     Then comes &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, which is probably the best song by Metallica. It's the hardest to play on guitar, and probably the best musically. It's mind-boggling how the band combined the slow melodic riffs in the middle of the song, with  fast and heavy riffs, into one song. I give it a 5.     Next is &quot;The Thing that Should Not Be&quot;. It's kind of easy to play, but it's still haunting and chilling. The lyrics are especailly good on this song. I give it a 4.     Then comes &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium)&quot;. It probably the most powerful song on the album. The chorus is just so powerful that you haveto sing it. It has the best lyrics one the album, maybe even best of any Metallica song. I give it a 5.     &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; is defiantly not the best song on the album, but it still isn't that bad. I starts out great but then it starts to become annoying. If you want a really good war song, then listen to &quot;One.&quot; 3.     Then there's &quot;Leper Messiah&quot;. It's a pretty good song, with nice guitars. I give it a 3 1/2. &quot;Orion&quot; is a very good instrumental song, with slow, melodic tones. And then it get's a little heavy, it's just nice to listen to. I give it a 4. &quot;Damage Inc.&quot; is okay. I think about it the same way I think about &quot;Disposable Heroes.&quot; But, the song is still pretty good. I give it a 3 1/2.<br />I defiantly recommend this album to anyone that likes metal, and even to anyone who doesn't.
0767803434|2.0|I still don't understand why everybody seems to love Air Force One so much.  First of all, the ground-based subplot with Glenn Close as the vice president is boring and just detracts from the movie's momentum.  Also, it's kind of interesting that the evil Secret Service agent tries to kill Harrison Ford at the end, even though none of the other villains are left to expose him and he could walk away without ever being suspected.  There was some scene that actually explained WHY that guy was betraying the president, but thanks to some boneheaded editing it was cut out of the movie and that character was reduced to just another stock villain.  In addition, almost all of the action sequences are sick mockeries of reality.  Granted, I can sort of go along with having that much random automatic gunfire on an airplane without losing cabin pressure.  But it's just ridiculous when the characters stand next to a big open hatch without getting sucked out into the sky and their hair just blows in the wind like they're standing in front of a movie studio fan.  And the most unintentionally funny moment has to be when the plane crashes-- the whole shot, one of the most awful CG effects I've seen in a big studio movie, is pathetic and kind of sad.  I don't understand why this film has been so successful and popular, especially since we've all seen MUCH better action movies from directors like James Cameron and John McTiernan.  Cameron could make a better movie than this standing on his head.  Sure the DVD is a nice way to show off your sound system, but there's something seriously wrong if you consider that reason enough to go out and buy this movie...

The plot is just as complicated, the writing is just as beautiful as the others, but the end just doesn't fit.  After finishing the book, I was depressed for about three days.  The book was totally on my mind.  I couldn't concentrate on anything other than the book.  Some like twenty pages until the end, I was sure the ending was going to be happy.  Instead, everything in the entire series comes tumbling down.  I wish that Pullman would REALLY finish the series and make the ending actually satisfactory.  I can't stand the ending.  The book was incredible, everything was wonderful, but the ending was heartrending.  You must not read this book with your kids.  They will totally flip if they've read the rest of the series.  They probably will start crying.  You should only read this book if you can stand horribly sad ending to incredibly written book.  The only hint I will give you about the ending, is that the sadness only has to do with the two main characters.  I hope you enjoy the book as much as I do, and I hope this review helped.

The book was totally on my mind.  I couldn't concentrate on anything other than the book.  Some like twenty pages until the end, I was sure the ending was going to be happy.  Instead, everything in the entire series comes tumbling down.  I wish that Pullman would REALLY finish the series and make the ending actually satisfactory.  I can't stand the ending.  The book was incredible, everything was wonderful, but the ending was heartrending.  You must not read this book with your kids.  They will totally flip if they've read the rest of the series.  They probably will start crying.  You should only read this book if you can stand horribly sad ending to incredibly written book.  The only hint I will give you about the ending, is that the sadness only has to do with the two main characters.  I hope you enjoy the book as much as I do, and I hope this review helped.
0385495323|5.0|When I was a boy, I was obsessed with secret writing (as, I imagine, almost every child with at least one nosy sibling becomes) and read everything the local library's Juvenile section had on the topic. I was disappointed to discover, when I went looking for more material, that there was apparently more cryptography material for kids than for grown-ups! This book not only took me back to those days with its discussion of secret writing throughout history (scytales, Playfair, Vignere...), it's also got an excellent section on cryptography in the World Wars (an excellent companion to Neal Stephenson's novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; in that regard!) and also explains the fundamental concepts of public-key cryptography in a readable, understandable format. As in Singh's earlier work on Fermat's Last Theorem, the people involved in creating and in breaking codes are often the focus, and some of these peope are fascinating. (Singh takes a break from strict cryptography at one point to discuss the &quot;breaking&quot; of ancient writing systems such as Egyptian hieroglyphics and Linear B, and this reminded me most strongly of &quot;Fermat's Enigma,&quot; as Singh's narrative carried the mysteries of interpretation from one researcher to the next.) The final chapter on quantum cryptography is a fascinating glimpse into what may be the &quot;final frontier&quot; of cryptography. Of course, any book like this one that discusses a still-evolving field gets dated pretty quickly; it is silly to expect Singh to mention the recent expiration of RSA's public-key patents or the relaxation of US export restrictions on strong cryptography, since these have all occurred within just the last few months, but the book nevertheless feels somehow incomplete without them!
0425170349|3.0|Although this book wasn't great, I can't say I was really disappointed with it. Alow me to explain,<br />I liked the story, it was different, I'd never read anything quite like it before. It had a great start, it really pulled you in fast (I always like that). But... (here it comes)<br />I was WAY TOO LONG! And I don't mean in the number of pages, I mean the story. Yeah it was a complicated story, but the book could have been shortened by at least 200 pages and we still could have understood what the author wanted us too, no problem. A lot of time was wasted explaining some things in WAY too much detail. And I noticed several things being repeated over and over and over.<br />When the team was sent out on a mission, it was very interesting and I didn't want to put the book down, but the slow parts were slow, long and then slow some more.<br />Read this book if you want, it's not terrible, I'm glad I read it, just don't start it with overly high expectations.

B00000BKDW|4.0|A true classic which sounds years ahead of its time, _Powerslave_, is probably my third favorite Maiden album behind _Seventh Son_ and _Somewhere in Time_.  Each and every song on this album is a jewel of energetic and graceful music combined with story-telling lyrics -- the most precious of which being the driving &quot;Aces High,&quot; mini-epic title-track &quot;Powerslave,&quot; and full-blown 13+ minute epic &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&quot;  Yet even singling out these songs seems to do an injustice to the rest of the sensational tracks on the album.  There is a certain amount of raw, unrefinedness to the album when compared to the albums that would be coming later ... never-the-less, in my opinion the production and mix on the album is still adequate at the very least.  This is an essnetial album for metal fans.

0679735909|5.0|It's a puzzle, a multi-dimensional love story, a treat filled with Robert Browning and Robert Browning-like poetry and luxurious prose. Five stars.
6301640659|1.0|William Friedkin knows his way around a good thriller -- he made The Exorcist, after all, arguably the most potent, effective, garishly horrific thriller of all time.  This movie, for all of its subliminal and outdated anti-gay sentiment, is so badly written and acted that in the end, it is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  It is one of those movies where the repugnant killings and dark, smoky, dangerous posturings come with no thrill, making them not only repugnant, but completely uninvolving.  The ending is unintentionally hilarious.  On the political side, it is no wonder, with propaganda like this, homosexuality got a bad rap in the 70s/early 80s...this movie portrays all of its many gay characters as pathetic vampire-ish creatures who live for the night and for dark, torturous encounters in hideously lit bars and back alleys. Yuck.
0380018179|4.0|This book was really a great book to read. I found it to be so realistic about a family spanning over three generations. The physical conflicts, as well as the emotional turmoil, has touched me. The story about a young women named Megghan, a priest named Ralph. A story about a women who can't marry a man she loves, and then takes the only thing she could of him. The story of a young man being the only precious son of Megghans mother, the only memory of a former lover. This was very appealing to me because it shows the life of heartbreak and romance in cycle after cycle. Family ties being revealed, and broken. The ending was so well written that it started me having to think of the realism and how it applies to my own life.As from other books I've read, it combines the mini-story detail of Ray Salisbury's&quot;The Blue Skin of the Sea&quot; with the deep emotions of John Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; None, however, can compare with the wellness McCullough mixes the character's internal and external conflicts into such an elaborate novel of emotional affection.

B00003CXHJ|4.0|Yes the Americans basically never pulled off anything like as depicted in the movie, but once you listen to all the extras on this dvd you will realize that this is a dramatic picture made in the United States, not Britan. All the details of the submarine and crew are realistically re-created for this movie, and the special effects are second to none. It hasn't been long since this movie was just in theatres, which kind of makes the experience of seeing the dvd a little less than I'm used to. What I really like about the dvd are the extras which talk about the making and various other parts of the movie. Those addons make this worth purchasing if you liked the movie.
B000002NJS|5.0|I never thought much about Madonna, good or bad.  Of course I knew who she was, outrageous outfits and all, but I didn't really care.  Then one day, I heard this great song on the radio - Ray of Light.  It was so different from everything else on the radio, and so fun!  I made a little &quot;note to self&quot; to look for the artist next time I was online.<br />When I got my search results, I was disappointed.  The only thing I found was some song by Madonna.  I just didn't think that could be right.  But, after searching various engines for a good half hour, I decided to listen to a sample just to see what was up.  Imagine my surprise when I heard the song I had fallen in love with earlier!  I had no idea Madonna had such good material, nor that she could sing so well!<br />I didn't rush out and buy the CD, thinking Ray of Light might be the only decent song on there.  I ended up downloading samples of all the songs, one after one, from the internet.  Each one was so new, different, and great - I just loved them all! I really couldn't believe it.  Me?  Like Madonna?  But I wanted the CD badly, so I dug into my savings to buy it.<br />Should you?  It depends if you like electronica.  This CD is full of it.  Of course, I never liked it that much either, and I am still extremely fond of the whole album.  From the opening track, the dreamy &quot;Substitute for Love,&quot; to the fast-paced &quot;Nothing Really Matters,&quot; to the sad, solid, and truthful &quot;Frozen,&quot; this album has got it all.  As a musician, I love the different rhythms, tempos, melodies, harmonies, and lyrics that compose this album.  Variety is the spice of life, and it also appears to be Madonna's favorite spice.<br />My favorite track?  Oh, how can I decide?!  The only one I didn't like was Candy Perfume Girl, and the first two minutes or so of Little Star (there's this part in the middle that's just so lovely, I want to listen to it over and over).  &quot;Power of Goodbye&quot; isn't a big favorite either.  But I love all the other songs in my own way.  I really feel like it was worth the $15 I paid... I like it so much now, I would pay twice that!<br />Bottom line:  A great album that will jump straight into the &quot;can't do without&quot; section of your CD collection!
0060925000|5.0|This book is a tour de force a Forsyth saga of India, but much more complex in its narration and its depth. Reading this is like getting another life served on a plate; As time moves in a life you meet new people, get to know them, like them even love some of them. By more or less mysterious ways some of them disappear, never to be seen again. Some people pop up at unexpected places, some moves in and out with regularity, some stays in your hearth for ever. This book is exactly like that. Fortunately it is a long book, so you do n not only get a new life, but a fairly long one also! The worst part of the book is again as in life, when the book moves on you realise that you do not know if you are going to meet your favorites again. The delight when you meet some of them again are often just as unexpected as in real life. It is a few times exceeded by the sadness of realizing that Vikram kept some of them to himself.<br />I recently had the great joy of seeing a long TV program with Vikram Seth and his family. One of the best sides of this was that I got to meet some flesh and blood versions of some of my favorites in the book. Vikrams mother had lent some of her personality to several of the fictious characters in the book, and also several of the other relatives. It was so delightful and only raised my opinion about Seth, who in the program came out as a very sensible young man. Suitable also! It was TV on its very best.<br />For those who liked this book as much as me I would advice them to read Arundathi Roy, Kiran Desai or V.S. Naipaul.
0440219078|5.0|This book is great.  I have read it many times over the years.  It is one of my all-time favorite books.  The world Lowry creates is so believable and realistic I can see the future turning out that way.
B00000JPHE|4.0|If only the camera would not pan away everytime Count Dracula got out of his coffin or anything exciting happened, this celebrated film version would hold up a lot better.  Still, this book is the primer on vampires for everybody else that comes on down the road, so this is where you want to start.  Renefield alone is worth the cost of renting the tape.  But if you have not seen Bela establish the model, you cannot appreciate what Anne Rice, Joss Whedon and others have been doing all these years.  Check out the Spanish version made at night while Tod Browning was making this one during the day.  Screen them back to back.
0394800184|5.0|I read this book when I was a young child (I was 4-5, so it'd be 8-9 years ago) and I found myself reading this book daily for months and months!<br />I thought the concept of a little bird looking for his mother and asking everything in sight was a marvelous and humorous idea.<br />Your child will be reading this book several times a day, just as I did. I remember vaguely carrying this book around, asking my mother to read it or reading it to myself multiple times a week. An epic adventure of a bird trying to reunite itself with its mother! Perfect for young ones!<br />(Also... I had no problems with being separated with my mother afterwards. I knew at the time it was ficticious.)
B0000062FN|5.0|Arguably, Santana's best overall album, this third selection from what is fondly called \\"the original band\\" covers all the bases - catchy hooks, instrumental workouts, and, of course, that trademark rhythm section pushing every selection into sonic overdrive.<br />For the first time, Carlos Santana gives another guitarist (Neal Schon) an important role on an album, and the results are spectacular. It's as if the competition pushes CS to achieve heights previously unreached. Just listen to the opening track - the guitars literally crackle with energy, and just when you think it's time to take a breath, the band slides directly into the second song without a break - the incendiary, \\"No One To Depend On\\", which still stops conversation in the car anytime it pops up on a classic rock station.<br />Surprisingly spare of vocals(count the number of selections that have little or no singing at all), it changes styles and tempo constantly. And, this is the album that made CS a guitar god. While he had certainly achieved a name for himself by 1971, the jaw-dropping style perfected by this time is still apparent today. Check out the use of wah-wah pedal on \\"Everybody's Everything\\"; is anyone besides Hendrix or Cream - era Clapton even in the ballpark with Mr. Santana on this specialized technique?<br />Santana (III) was the ultimate achievement of Santana's musical goals before an almost completely new direction was sought during the balance of the 70's. It still stands today as a landmark in instrumental rock.
B00003BDXG|5.0|I won't endorse &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; as a true masterpiece, but it comes close. I just saw this film for the first time and it is unlike anything you have seen before, the editing is so fast that your head will be spinning while you watch this. A lot of people complained that this film is a mess directed by a hack. I personally think Oliver Stone is one of the best directors around. &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; is a very hyper movie it never stops for a second, Stone switches from Color to Black and White to 8mm to animation, it employs virtually every visual cinematic trick in existence. I think it was actually very clever by Stone to use different film stocks, the most violent scenes in the movie are in black and white and that lessens the impact of the violence. You don't watch this movie you experience it. See the movie for yourself and decide.
0684853523|5.0|In my youth, I read a great deal of Stephen King's fiction. As I grew older, I began to find my interests leading me away from horror, and as a result, I began to pay less and less attention to (please excuse the familiar) Steve's newer releases.     When I heard that he was releasing a book on writing, which I have returned to (my original passion), I was ecstatic. I knew it would be good, and it did not disappoint.     In fact, I was blown away. The book read like a conversation with an old friend I hadn't spoken with in many years. I was inspired, not only to pick up my pen and turn on my word processor, but to revisit Steve's older work.     If you've never read anything by him, this is as good a place to start as any. If you've ever been put off by his approach, this is a great place to learn who the man (behind the rumors you may have heard) is. I highly recommend getting to know him. You won't be disappointed.
0671015206|4.0|This book has an unexpectable findings on those that are rich, and by rich, I meant their net worth, and not their lifestyle.<br />Thomas Stanley found that those millionairs are just like you and me, living frugally, save alot and only buy things they can afford. In contrast to those celebrities that live in big houses and drive flashy cars, the millioairs are those that live in ordinary neigbourhood and drive a second-hand car.<br />By living frugally and invest for the long term, those people achieve a high net-worth, with plenty of money tucked aside. In contrast, many people that looks rich on the surface may be runing out of cash if the next paycheck does not arrive in time.<br />A book worth reading.
B00000K19E|5.0|this movie is so much more than a bunch of special effects which were great, i mean the special effects are a great installment but its not all the movie is.  It sars lawerence fishburne who plays morpheous, he brings in neo played by keanu reeves to see what the world is really likes and bring him into the real world as they say in the movie. keanu reeves, lawerence fishburne and karei ann moss must stop agents who are holding all the keys to thier future. but theres one problem these agents are like unkillable and the only one who can defeat them is as they say in the movie &quot;the one&quot;.  IT is a really great movie that is a must buy.

Especally the last fifteen minutes which are some of the scariest minutes in film history.
0805017305|3.0|...I was reading it for school.  While this book is a compelling tale about the atrocities committed against the Indians by the white Americans, it is very difficult to retain the information contained in it for testing or quizzing.  <br />My enjoyment (or horror) in reading this, however, was severely hindered by my goal:  To read for the information.  This is just not that kind of a book.  I am writing this mainly for the benefit of teachers who are considering using this book for a curriculum tool.  Perhaps it should be used for recommended outside reading to give students a feel for the treatment that the American Indians endured at the hands of the intrusive white government, but not as a textbook.<br />All in all, I did enjoy the book.  I only wish I had been reading for pleasure, and not work.
0679735259|5.0|A mindblowing account of that electric guitar war called Vietnam. Deep, chaotic, surreal. After reading it years ago the images are still burned into my consciousness. The closing left me breathless.
0399146253|2.0|I am one of Patsy Cornwell's biggest and longest fans. I have her personal autograph setting on my desk. So it is with regret that I say this is probably her worst work to date. For some reason she has decided to use an over abundence of words to tell a very predicatable story. Almost to the point you can guess what you are going to read on the pages before you turn them. She has added caracters that really have no relevance to the story or maybe I should say they would certainly not have been missed. Also leaving no question where the next book will start and who it will include.  I also think she made a really big effort to include Lucy's sexual preference more often than necessary. I have absolutly no problem with homosexuality, but it seems as though she has made it one of the major themes of this story. Nevertheless, having said all this I would never miss one of her books!
B0000028RR|5.0|First off, let me say that this is one of the greatest cd I have EVER listened to.  I first bought it 6 months ago, and I would say that I have and still do listen to it an average of 30 minutes EVERY SINGLE DAY.  That is how creative it is, and how this creativity masks it from ever getting old (unless you spun the entire cd for a year nonstop!).  I pride myself on having extremely refined and picky music tastes, and this one easily fulfills my one extremely hard requirement: uniqueness.  Here is a lowdown on the songs<br />Bombtrack: Don't let the soft opening make you skip it.  It gets HARDER and is an awesome song<br />Killing in the Name: Holds a special place in my heart for the first song that introduced me to this album.  Dont skip it.<br />Take the Power back: Very cool groove oriented song.  Can get slightly repetitive, but only for an instant, because by that time youll be near one of the best guitar solos on the album.<br />Settle for Nothing: Basically, all the tiny blotches were removed from all the other songs, making them flawless, and concentrated here, making this a weak track.  I always skip it.<br />Bullet in the Head: An awesome, strong track that really gets me in a good mood.<br />Know your enemy: Again, dont let the opening fool you.  HARD and HOT song.<br />Wake up:  Awesome song, even if Zach's lyrics sound nothing like whats printed on the album insert.<br />Fistfull of Steel: The guitar is repetive, but for some reason always holds my attention.  Very cool<br />Township Rebellion:  A bullet in the head type song.  Real cool groove, which, about 3 min in, becomes hard and angry.<br />Freedom:  Takes a little time to get into, just have the patience to listen to the whole thing and you'll love it.<br />Well, overall, by this album, and if you want more, I would recommend Battle of LA because it is much more similar to this album than the (for lack of a better word) wierd Evil Empire.
6302814782|5.0|i am a big fan of.....ok i forget his name but he was in the goonies and a bunch of other movies too.  this is his best movie.  i friggin love his character in this.  this is one of the few good movies that came out of the 80's along with some great stuff like Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  and the music from the 80's?  aside from stuff like the clash and sex pistols, music was horrible.  The Lost Boys is one of the best movies from the 80's.  i just love it, thats all i have to say.  when i first saw it i was just like &quot;hell yeah!&quot;  This is a classic for me and i reccomend it to any kid like me.......
B00004XOWM|4.0|I have been awaiting this CD for years and it is finally here. It may not be everything I expected, but pretty good anyway. This CD basically has a taste of Rock and rap. For you rockers, Rollin' is your song. It doesn't come close to Nookie, but a great song. For you hip-hoppers, Getcha Groove On is there. Again, N 2 Gether now was much better. The only songs I skip on this CD is maybe Hot Dog and Full Nelson. Everything else is great. Buy this CD now! And buy the Green Day CD, too!
B00004Z4WR|5.0|This movie is the best movie I have seen all year it is also the best movie of its kind, with great actors and a good story line I give it 5 stars!
B00004Y6RO|5.0|I'm sure you've read all of the other reviews, and they all said it-Slipknot equals madness.  They are 9 insane guys that put on an incredibly intense live show.  Their music is the type that you kill to.  Every one of the members plays their insturments with a brutal expertise that pounds the listener into oblivion.  EVERY SINGLE SONG IS GREAT!!  They first released the cd in 1999, and it was easily the release of the year.  Roadrunner re-released their debut this year, which is what you're reading about, with 5 or 6 (depending on which version you bought of the album the first-go-round) new songs.  I can't even explain how amazing and hardcore this cd is, and if you haven't bought it yet, I have to ask What's your problem??  If you haven't bought Slipknot yet, then you go buy it now!
B000002A3T|5.0|Like most people, I bought The Wall and DSOTM first, because I'm 19 and I wasn't exposed to the early floyd.  This album ranks right up with the best of floyd.  People are always comparing the periods of Floyd(Barret, Waters, Post-Waters).  Why can't they just look at it like one band who is progessing over the years.  If there is one thing to be sure of, Floyd is a prog-rock band.  The songs on each album have a place in the order of the record and the albums are ment to be heard in their entirety.  They are also a prog-rock band in the sense that the physical members of the band are always growing and changing as well.  This a great album, plain and simple.  If it had been released twenty years earlier, it still would be a great album.  I just feel like people take sides over the issue of which era of Floyd is the best.  They are all wonderful in their own right, so enjoy them for their differences and similarities. <br />Because this a review, I suppose I should describe some of the album.  &quot;What do you want from me?&quot; is a bonafide hit, with its paced, funky flavor.  &quot;Keep talking&quot;  is really cool with the Stephen Hawking sample.  But these are just a few of the top of my head.  Like all FLoyd albums, this one is great as an album, meaning that you have to listen to it from start to finish.  I hope you enjoy these tunes as much as I do.
0790729369|5.0|This is one of those movies where it feels so good to feel so bad.  I didn't like this movie the first time I saw it but I think you must watch it more than once to appreciate it. For anyone that has lived in a small community like Francesa and lived on a farm and felt the isolation you can relate to this movie.  I'm not saying that justifies cheating on your spouse but you see how it could happen.  You are a lonely farmwife and a charming photographer shows up on your doorstep.  Hello!  Client Eastwood was perfect in this role and is extremely sexy.  Meryl Streep is awesome.  To me this movie isn't just a romance about Francesa and Robert although that part of the movie is excellent but also about how Francesa's children came to understand who their mother really was.  I cried as much at that point in the movie as I did when Francesa sees Robert standing in the rain and the expressions on their faces when they realize they will never see each other again. When people complain that the scenes cutting back to the kids are boring to me they are not. It tells another part of the story and brings you back to the present showing how at first the kids are angry and upset about what their mother did.  By the end of the movie they understand why she did what she did and what she gave up for them because she loved them and as her last gift to them it frees them to move on and make decisions in their own lives.  Their mother gave them the courage to take the bull by the horn and appreciate life now before it's too late.  They learn that their mother was so much more than they ever knew.  These actors were excellent also.  When Francesa receives the box in the mail from Robert and saw that he never forgot her it's almost too much to bear.  You can feel what she's thinking and what might have been.  But that, of course, would have been a different movie altogether.  This movie reminds me in some ways of The Horse Whisperer and I didn't like that movie at first either.  But themore I see both of these movies the more I learn to appreciate them.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|OKAY, WHATS GOING ON HERE! HUMM, LETS SEE, WE HAVE ABSOLUTLY NO ORIGINAL ACTORS OF THE NORMAL CHARACTERS LIKE Q AND M, DOESN'T EVEN START WITH THE GUN BARREL, HAS A STORY THATS BEEN USED PROBABLY 100 TIMES ALLREADY AND A BOND THAT JUST CAN'T CUT IT ANNYMORE! THE ONLY SLIGHT GOOD PART TO THIS WAS THE FACT THAT SEAN SONERY WAS IN IT! THATS IT! IF YOU'R A BOND FAN, TRUST ME, YOU DONT NEED THIS ONE IN YOU'R COLLECTION!
6300185311|5.0|This is the last of the Day/Hudson/Randall movies, and it's a fitting ending to a wonderful trio of movies. Rock Hudson takes center stage in this movie, and he is wonderful as a hypochondriac who sets out to find a new husband for his wife when he believes he is going to die. The ensuing results are witty and timeless. Paul Lynde is on hand to steal a couple scenes as an overeager &quot;salesman.&quot;
6305949980|5.0|This looks and sounds so much better on DVD. <br />I can't say enough good things about this film. It has a look like no other and it certainly reflects the skill of the crafstmen that made the whole thing. Just a magical, inventive movie that enjoy so much. The songs aren't half bad, probably because they are kept shorter than a traditional disney feature. <br />Anyway, I really don't like many of Burton's films. They all emphasize visuals over story. Since most of the visuals are the same in all his other movies, they become boring. This is by far the most entertaining of  Burton's films and in my opinion the best.
B00000JSJC|5.0|I find Kathryn Bigelow's work is really amazing and she proves once again directing STRANGE DAYS that she controls her own pictures perfectly.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Well the rap metal scene is uplifted by a new release by limp bizkit whose claim to fame is covering a george michael song.  Why do these rap rock bands come out with a new album every year?  Every album by bands from this genre sounds alike and it's not a good sound; rap and rock make a poor combo.  The albums lyrics are nonsense.  This is pure mtv fodder and I know that millions will be sold but what does that say about the state of music.  Most critics agreee that the last half of the ninties musically was weak and that's when this rap metal thing began.  I hope they go away but kids in this country are too stupid and worried about &quot;style??&quot; over substance.  What ever happened to 80's alternative, how did that exellent music fade away only to be replaced by this garbage; it's sad and I hope that this trend dies a painful death....
0684853523|5.0|I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did.  It was a great read.  King gives you an in-depth picture into his life, his childhood, his love of his wife and family, and the path he's taken to become a successful writer.  The detailed tips on writing were well-done and quite helpful.<br />I must say, the parts I enjoyed most were the glimpses into his childhood and adolescence, and then his adult life with his beloved Tabby.  It was refreshing to find out just how much he loves and respects his wife.  The account of the accident that almost ended his life was gripping and real;  I never considered that he came that close to death.  And what a loss that would have been!<br />This book is a must-have for any King fan, but is also informative and helpful for the struggling, would-be writers out there.  As a memoir and a lesson in writing, this book succeeds in all counts.
B00003CWL6|1.0|This movie had some good lessons, but I thought it was unrealistic. It was a movie that pushed a false reality. We practically all go through a little phase where we think we are being shocking, we think we harber this little rebellious adolescent secret of disgust toward most of humanity and secret way of behaving when not around others, and we are going to go out there and do this lifestyle that just because it's taboo, we think we want it, even though we don't.  It was like encouraging that done to death scenario. Did the main character ever give a thought to whether HE was satisfying everyone else?  Did he ever sit and agonize over whether he was impeccably faithful to his wife in thought/sight/action, or whether he could make her really pleased? Did he ever obsess over being the perfect father?   Did he ever stop to think.  The movie definitely had that &quot;shock jock&quot; quality.
6304056958|5.0|&quot;The Woman&quot; is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. For one thing there are no men here. But you don't miss them because they are the subject of the movie. The movie is adapted from a play by Clare Boothe, directed by wonderful George Cukor and has Butterfly McQueen (Ms. Scarlett, I don't know nuthin' 'bout birthin' babies), famed columnist Hedda Hopper and Hattie McDaniel in it as well Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind and others in the starring roles. Ruth Hussey plays a secretary and Virgina Grey is stunning as a store clerk. This comedy deals with issues that are never ending, cheating husbands, bitchy friends and divorce. Rosalind Russell as Norma Shearer's catty underhanded cousin is my favorite. These actresses are at their freshest and most beautiful. In the film all of the principals are wealthy, very much &quot;high maintenence&quot; and  bored so they do lunch and go to fashion shows. Although the movie is black and white the magnificent fashion sequence is in color. I saw first saw &quot;The Women&quot; on a small b/w TV, imagine my surprise years later when I saw it on a color set and they started showing the fashions. WOW! Joan Crawford has one of her best man grabbing, husband stealing roles in this movie. At one point when the husband needs to cancel their date. She becomes indignant because &quot;he tried to stand Joan up for his wife&quot;. Another time in a confrontation with the wife  she says &quot;When Stephen doesn't like what I'm wearing, I take it off&quot; Are we sure this movie was made in 1939??However, all of these women are such a tight knit clique that they even go to the same divorce dude ranch in Reno (group divorce??) which is owned by Margorie Main who has no sympathy for these rich spoiled and pampered women.If you like your movies sharp, witty, fast paced and classy this is the movie for you. It's as fresh now as it was in 1939, especially when Mary (Norma Shearer) tells her mother, after she has found out that her husband is cheating on her, &quot;Mother, this is the 20th century. . .&quot; Her mother has said that Mary's father did the same thing and she kept quite, that Mary should also &quot;keep quiet, do nothing and say nothing.&quot;  There are so many witty quotes that time has not tarnished that you will be tempted to use them yourself.out that her husband is cheating on her, &quot;Mother, this is the 20th century. . .&quot; Her mother has said that Mary's father did the same thing and she kept quite, that Mary should also &quot;keep quiet, do nothing and say nothing.&quot;  There are so many witty quotes that time has not tarnished that you will be tempted to use them yourself.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Of all the albums I have heard or listened to over the years this may well be my favorite of all time. This is the kind of album you can listen to a thousand times (and believe me I have) and still find something new in the music or lyrics that somehow escaped you the time before. Setting the mood and contrast for the entire album, the first and title track begins with an acoustic guitar and background of singing birds that eventually soar into stark and grim warnings of where current societal paths may lead.    We turned our gaze from the castles in the distance.    Eyes cast down on the path of least resistance.      The second track, Xanadu, is quite simply, a masterpiece, and tells the tale of a man who regrettably gets his wish of immortality.    A thousand years have come and gone   But time has past me by,   Stars stopped in the sky   Frozen in an everlasting view.      Waiting for the world to end    Weary of the night.    Praying for the light.    Prison of the lost - Xanadu.       As with most of RUSH's work, Neil Peart's lyrics are powerful, but never more articulate and profound than here. The overriding theme of the album involves implementation of the heart into decision making. The last song on the album, Cygnus X-1 tells the tale of a space traveler who sails his ship into a black hole only to emerge in their subsequent album \\"Hemispheres\\" as a god arbiter of the heart vs. the mind, where reason makes it's argument.    Food and wine they had aplenty   And they slept beneath the stars.   The people where contented    And the gods watched from afar.        But the winter fell upon them    And it caught them unprepared.   Bringing wolves and cold starvation   And the hearts of men despaired....       What makes these two albums work is the fact that they are not poetry set to music, nor are they music accompanied by poetry. The two are as one and fit together seamlessly. The emotion of the two rise and fall and fit together perfectly as one.
B000002KMY|3.0|Despite Sign of the Southern Cross is ones of Sabbath's best the album as a whole is not one of my favorites, it lacks the edge of previous liricks.
0679879269|5.0|&quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; shows Philip Pullman at his best. After reading the spellbinding sequel to &quot;The Golden Compass,&quot; &quot;The Subtle Knife,&quot; I waited months for this book to come out, The Subtle Knife having rose to the top of my book list and becoming my favorite. But now The Amber Spyglass is my favorite book. I hate to give away the details, but it is full of everything I wanted to happen in The Subtle Knife. In the beginning of the book we discover Lyra's capturer and Will goes out to save her with some help. It really shows how much they care about eachother, and they go out on a limb to the world of the dead to rescue the ghosts. Mary Malone has also left her world (and Will's) and has befriended some strange, yet very kind creatures. Towards the end of the book, Lyra and Will fall in love, which makes it even harder for them to part. (Since I've given it all away I'm hoping you've read the book before you read my review!! But if you haven't, my advice is simply READ THE BOOK!! It's the best 518 pages you'll find.)
B000000OAC|5.0|Next to A Night At The Opera, this is probably the most famous Queen album. Yes, it has We Will Rock You and We Are The Champions and as long a sporting events exist these songs will live on, but I'd like to call your attention to some other really good tracks. As in all the best Queen albums, the styles are diverse. Brian does a wondeful bluesy job on Sleeping on the Sidewalk, John Deacon gives us a sort of Cha Cha on Who Needs You, and I dare you not to sing along with Freddy on It's Late. It's on this album that the song Sheer Heart attack finally appears and you can see the precursor of speed metal in it. A must for old fans and a good introduction for new ones.
B00004U8PA|5.0|Now here's a calssic if there ever was one. The songs- so catchy. The humor- so raunchy. The fun- so MUCH fun! I would say this piece of SINema is suitable for anyone- with a few screws loose! No, it really is a riot, and a very memorable riot at that! Some scenes will stick to your memory like glue for years, and when a film can do that and continue to bring a smile to your face, well, you know its good. Tim Curry gives an outrageous performance as a transvestite alien who just happens to sleep with practically EVERYONE in his mansion, including a young, innocent, American couple, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick. As you can tell, I'm enthusiastic about this movie, though I'm sure not everyone is- some scenes border on just plain indecent. But hey, if your definition of indecent is just plain fun, I think you'll thouroghly enjoy this movie, and you might just catch yourself humming the tunes while you drive to the supermarket!
B000000OAH|4.0|I know this is many people's favorite Queen album, but I can't get away from the feeling that this one has alot of filler in it. True Bicycle Race is one of their best songs and lyrically it's brilliant (what other song can combine Watergate and Star Wars?) But songs like Leaving Home Ain't Easy, In Only 7 Days and Fun It are not up to the usual Queen standards. Having said that, Jazz does have some gems. Let Me Entertain You, Dead On Time and Dreamers Ball rank with best of Queen. I just keep wondering if they were all still on the same page all the time with this one.
0515125024|4.0|I found this book to be very interesting and the pace was just right. While I found some of the stuff to be a little boring they were made up for with the fast-paced action.
1573226521|2.0|The beginning of the novel is exciting. Describing the backpacker scene in Bangkok, and the death of the mysterious traveler with his story of a legendary Beach, untouched by human hands, that everyone is looking for. This searching for a Shangri La in exotic surroundings describes the state of mind of the young long distance backpacker very well, where Shangri La or the Beach can be a symbol for a lot of things. Once the Beach is found though it turns out to be a dissapointment. It's the searching for the unknown that was fun. The Beach turns out to be populated by your average collection of travelers you meet on the road. And after an initial spell of the ecxitement caused by the meeting of like-minded people, they turn out to be rather irritating and pretty boring. This is exactly what happens with the novel too. There isn't a lot to do on the Beach either. Reader, may you never find what you are looking for!
B00004XONN|5.0|i was a late-comer to radiohead, but this album took, and still takes, my breath away. listen to it yourself, and play it over and over again, and fall asleep listening to it -- it will really work you over. this band is becoming a legend already, and that makes the listen that much more exciting.
0380788624|5.0|This is a great panoramic book written by a genius. Better again then his previous novels. It's suspenseful, thrilling, adventurous, funny and well-written. It's about World War II, espionage, U-boats, survival and the hiding of gold, and about the information age, high-tech startups, computers, cryptography and the searching of gold. The book jumps back and forth through space and time with every chapter, and involves so many interconnected stories that you sometimes lose track of what happened. But history is like that too. There are prolonged and detailed descriptions of all kinds of things and events but it never gets boring because they're invariable interesting, and because of the writing style. Allthough some of the characters are caricatures, most of them are interesting. There are some loose ends though. In the end not all characters are accounted for. And who in the ... was this fellow Andy Loeb exactly? And how does he suddenly show up at the end in a business suit with a bow and arrow in the middle of the jungle? It's a very male book too of course. I can't imagine women liking this book.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|i liked this album even more after seeing the movie. as with a lot of bjork's work, there is a childlike guilelessness in the lyrics that throws the caterwauling delivery and sophisticated arrangements into even sharp relief. add to that the ironic placement of the songs in the movie (for example, &quot;you're always there to catch me when i fall&quot; is sung to the police officers dragging her to jail), and you get a great listen. especially recommended for people like me that dig classical music along with bjork and other dj and pop acts.
B00003CWL6|3.0|I've tried two copies of this DVD but it won't play on my Philips-Magnavox DVD-850. It's a Toshiba rebranded player, about 2 years old. This is the first DVD disc I've tried that does not work (watched over 100 DVDs).
B00004RF98|3.0|Classic film. No one can dispute that. So why are there virually no extras on a DVD of the greatest movie musical ever made? Why are there no bios on anyone associated with the film? Why does the color for the first half of the film look like faded Technicolor? Why did the studio not choose to take the time or spend the money needed to digitally restore the film that was spent on Sound of Music or My Fair Lady? OK. It would cost more, but fans of this movie would be willing to pay for it, and all the other wonderful MGM movies musical of the 50s. <br />...Give us the extras - let us know the story of the movie, produce a feature length documentary, give us the re-mixed isolated soundtrack, do something besides this. Correct the color, and remix the ST in DTS. Package in in a two DVD set and charge me 30 bucks. I'd buy it. But the current release version is a real disappointment. The singin', dancin', and actin' in this film deserve better.
0790729725|1.0|I bought Goodfellas on DVD yesterday at a local major chain store yesterday - I would greatly appreciate it they if you would let people know that the DVD only has HALF the movie on each side - I know this is Warner Brothers' (and I e-mailed them about it) doing but I'm kinda annoyed that a DVD would split the movie in half and I would have to stop and turn it over like some old record album. Also, given the cheesy cases, maybe Warner Brothers DVD's should be sold but not given any promotional space since after my last WB purchase I'm not likely to buy any more DVD's for a while and when I do I don't think I'll be buying any WB issues.
B00000JGHL|3.0|This political thriller isn't bad.  It's well cast with strong performances. (You've probably seen Al Pacino do this before, though.)   It has good pacing, clarity and moving speeches.   It examines the possibility that the deal making necessary for political effectiveness is also the root of corruption.  Still, it's nothing to go out of your way to see.<br />First, it's predictable. You know whose clay feet the trail of corruption must lead to.  One minor character mentions that he's six months from retirement. You know he'll never collect the pension. <br />Also, the film had four writers and seems haunted by distracting fragments from abandoned drafts as if someone wrote things that others took in different directions.  Shifting character focus between drafts would explain why important characters often receive perfunctory development while others seem overwritten.  The film lacks a center because Mayor Papas (Pacino) is simply a charismatic icon- important only for what he represents to others. Brigit Fonda plays an attractive do-gooder who challenges the hero (John Cusack) to be true to his ideals. There's little chemistry because her character lacks development and their relationship is a formulaic flirtation.   By contrast, Danny Aiello's character, an Italian politician, defies stereotype because he loves musical theater rather than opera. However, since the character is otherwise predictably stereotypical, the attention given his musical tastes (including a strange duet with a waiter) seems pointless.<br />Indeed, ethnic and regional origins often substitute for character development here.  The hero's Louisiana hometown is mentioned twice, establishing him as an idealistic but wily outsider. Yet, curiously, the mayor is a Greek who spouts yiddishisms.  That and other scattered references made me wonder if he wasn't Jewish in earlier drafts and a more developed character.  Now, the Jewish references just seem like lame, out-of-towner attempts at New York local color.
6305627401|1.0|I loved the TV show, or at least the 10 or 15 episodes I've seen, often its alternative take made me laugh with gusto. This movie was a major disappointment. Stupid song and dance numbers about farting. I was about to detail the most stupid stuff, but I don't remember more than one or two laughs during the whole movie. So, if you liked the show, you may hate the movie.
B00004XOWM|5.0|I was looking forward to this album very much. The album contains excellent songs [especially FULL NELSON and TAKE A LOOK AROUND FROM MI2]not forgetting MY GENERATION AND ROLLING [URBAN]. I have to say the lyrics are a load of nothing and dont mean anything unlike RAGE AGAINST MACHINES fight for communism but i think the album has some heavy songs which are very good and shows limp bizkit can rock and rap and also combine with METHOD MAN and DMX to make some cool tunes. The band have a lot of talent and Fred Durst should make at least 3 more albums in the near future. I look forward to hearing them. I would also like to put this message across to everyone:                      I WONT STAND FOR THAT WEAK RUBBISH ON THE RADIO LIKE TRUESTEPPERS AND CRAIG DAVID PLUS MANY OTHER BANDS ESPECIALLY THE NO TALENTED,SONG COPYING WESTLIFE. THIS MUSIC IS AROUND FOR A MONTH AND JUST GOES WHICH SHOWS THE POOR CHART MUSIC. WHAT WE NEED IS A LOT MORE SLIPKNOT,RAGE AGAINST MACHINE,LIMP BIZKIT,SYSTEM OF A DOWN TO TAKE OVER MUSIC AND SHOW PEOPLE TRUE MUSIC WITH PROPER INSTRUMENTS. IF YOU AGREE YOU MUST EMAIL ME NOW! FIGHT SH'TE MUSIC AND JOIN ME! THANKYOU
B00004U5SC|5.0|Shane has long been one of my favorite movies; but I'd never before seen it in the theater, previously limited to TV showings chock full of advertising interruption. This DVD version is very well done, except for some sound volume variation problems, revealing the extraordinary cinematography and acting. The commentary (yes, watched it through twice last night) added significantly to my enjoyment.<br />So, watch the good guys win in the end, albeit wounded along the way, Shane perhaps irrevocably, and be surprised by how appealing, even rational, some of the bad guys are.
B00000JCOV|5.0|THIS IS AGREAT DEBUT ALBUM. A SUPERB IDEA OF NINE MEMBERS TO CREATE SUPER FAST DRUMMING AND EXCEPTIONAL GUITAR. LISTEN FOR THE HIDDEN TRACK ON SCISSORS AT THE END [THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM]. THEY MAY BE CRAZY BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF TALENT AND PROMOTE A GOOD MEANING BY WEARING MASKS. ID LIKE TO SAY A BOY CALLED DAN GREGORY THINKS HE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT MUSIC BUT SADLY DOESNT LIKE HIS SAD FRIEND CHRIS EDWARDS. ANYONE WHO LIKES MUSIC APART FROM THEM IS A WANNABE [ALLEGIDLY] BY THEM. THERE THE F'CKING WANNABES AND THEY DONT WANT PEOPLE TO SUPPORT THEIR MUSIC. THESE SORT OF PEOPLE ARE SAD AND SHOULD BE KNOCKED OUT I HAVE TO SAY.

0783225725|3.0|I really enjoy the westerns and Clint Eastwood, but with all honesty fid many of the above reviews a little exagerrated. Thisi movie is no math for the trilogy or another classic western Once upon a time in the west. if you want a true western, skip this one, and start with the GBU and the rest of sergio leone flicks
B00003CWTI|1.0|This movie....ugh. Would somebody mind explaining to me the allure of this movie? Wait, would somebody who has seen Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS and Todd Solondz' HAPPINESS mind telling me what the allure of this movie is? Original it ain't. <br />Anyone who has seen the aforementioned movies knows darn well that ... Anderson cribbed so many elements from both movies it is PATHETIC. Save for Tom Cruise's performance, Anderson manages to waste a lot of talent with his cliche dialogue and self-gratifying camera moves (totally unmotivated and obvious), never really getting to the point. What was the point? Frogs? Great, flying amphibians. Anyhow, don't waste your time. See HAPPINESS and SHORT CUTS instead. END
020530902X|5.0|This book should be the starting point for all students who are learning to write. This is an easy sell, the book is written with its own rules and conveys information in a clear, succinct manner.<br /><br />I want to clarify a few points. The book isn't giving directions on how to write poetry, or literature. The book is about clarity and conveying information. It also isn't the be all and end all of style, there are some other excellent books that do as good a job.<br /><br />The reason that I would choose this one over those others (\\"The Craft of Research\\" or \\"Style: Towards Clarity and Grace\\") is that this book is so digestible. It is the epitome of short and sweet.<br /><br />People who read this book and apply the rules will improve their writing.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is a really good album, first of all. However, it's less hard metal and more rap metal. The music is a lot &quot;smoother&quot; than on the first CDs, but I thought it was really good stuff. Yeah, I noticed the ICP mimic and Durst wanted to diss Nine Inch Nails in track 2 for some reason.  Whatever. Nice rap CD.  Buy it.
B000002NHN|5.0|I was searching for any news from this wonderfull woman singer. Her work is simply fantastic, it makes me fluctuate everytime I hear her magic voice. I miss the english words to express my real feelings about Loreena, but I had to say something. I've got all of her records and it's impossible to say which of them is the best.The last one I ordered here from Amazon: Loreena live in Paris and Toronto. I risk to say that the best is the one you're hearing at the moment. Even one music that you don't find in records ( at least I didn't find ), I downloaded from the internet as mp3 file. Her name is a guarantee of excelent quality, no doubts about it. Loreena has become a vice for me and it's easy to happen to anyone who's got a minimum of music sensibility...

B00000K0T8|5.0|This is right up there with Liquid Swords and Only Built For Cuban Linx. It has the gambino mafia type of stuff that we all like, the interesting lyrics, and just plain WU. There were a lot of just plain great songs in here. Like Iron Maiden, a fast tempo song that's sort of not Wu style. 260, a great beat with Ghost and Rae telling a story about a dope deal. Wildflower, a song where Ghost gets mad at his ex-wife. Faster Blade, a Raekwon single promoting Wu-Tang. Winter Warz, probly the best song on this album, it's known for Cappadonna's 2 minute MURDER session. I think that as a listener you will every single song on here enjoyable. Now, don't think that you will purely enjoy this album...because there are some low points, not major ones, but it does exasperate me. Everyone will say this, it's Ghostface's GODDAMN lyrics...sometimes you just can't comprehend what in the world he is talking about. But who can you blame execpt yourself for not understanding all that. It's like he's talking in hieroglyphics. There will be 1 or 2 songs that will have you confused at the topic, but that won't stop you from enjoying this album
B00002MZ2C|5.0|i bought the c.d. &quot;the battle of los angeles&quot; by rage against the machine and i REALLY loved it. i think it was one of their best c.d.'s and i have tried to get all of my friends to buy it. a lot of them did and thanked me for pressuring them into it. they said it was one of the best c.d.'s they have ever listened to in a long time. they have so many good song's on the album you NEVER EVER get tired of listening to it. if you are debating on whether or not to but it, DEFENITLY buy it, it is DEFENITLY worth he money you will spend on it!!
B000002IWH|5.0|There's so much to love about this soundtrack.  It's dark, but it also has its tender parts, like the movie did.  The cure starts the cd with &quot;Burn&quot;, a tortured, haunting, strange kind of love song befitting of Robert Smith on a bad day.  The Machines of Loving Grace come next with a breathy, sinister vocals and minimal guitar.  Stone Temple Pilots' Big Empty is reflective and powerful, and is one of STP's easier songs to sing along with, as you'll no doubt be doing.  Nine Inch Nails' cover of Deads Souls is up to true Trent Reznor form, screaming about torment, in the beautiful way.  Rage Against the Machine, Rollins Band, Helmet, Pantera, and My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult add acid to the mix while the Violent Femmes, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Medicine, and Jane Siberry mellow it for just the right amount of contrast.  Perfecto.

B00003CWTI|5.0|WHERE SHOULD I BEGIN?  THE FILM TAKES PLACE DURING 24 HOURS IN THE LIVES OF 9 CHARACTERS.  FIRST THERE IS JIMMY GATOR (AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE BY PHILIP BAKER HALL).  JIMMY GATOR IS A GAME SHOW HOST FOR WHAT DO KIDS KNOW?  A POPULAR GAME SHOW, AND HE IS WORLD KNOWN FOR HIS CAREER.  NEXT, THERE IS STANLEY SPECTOR (ANOTHER GREAT PERFORMANCE, BY CHILD ACTOR JEREMY BLACKMAN).  HE IS PRESSURED BY HIS ALCHOHOLIC FATHER TO BEAT THE RECORD ON THE SAME GAME SHOW WHAT DO KIDS KNOW?  IF HE CAN LAST ANOTHER TWO WEEKS ANSWERING QUESTIONS HE WILL BECOME THE QUIZ KID, WHICH WOULD BE A RECORD.  WILLIAM H. MACY (ONE OF THE FINER ACTORS TODAY) PLAYS EX QUIZ KID DONNIE SMITH.  DONNIE WAS IN THE SAME POSITION THAT STANLEY, THE BOY GENIUS, WAS IN, WHEN HE BEAT THE RECORD IN 1968.  THE GAMESHOW HOSTS DAUGHTER, CLAUDIA WILSON GATOR IS PLAYED BY MELORA WALTERS.  CLAUDIA HAS A LOT ANGER TOWARD HER FATHER JIMMY, DESPITE HIS FAME.  SHE IS TROUBLED AND SUFFERS FROM DRUG ADDICTION AMONG OTHER THINGS.  SERIOUS, YET CLUMSY OFFICER JIM KURRING IS PLAYED BY JOHN C. REILY (ANOTHER GREAT ACTOR).  THE POLICE MAN IS DESPERATE TO MEET SOMEONE AND FALL IN LOVE, AND MEETS CLAUDIA WHEN HE COMES TO CHECK OUT A DISTURBANCE.  HE THEN FALLS IN LOVE WITH HER.  AT THE SAME TIME, EARL PARTRIDGE (JASON ROBARDS) IS DYING RAPIDLY OF CANCER, AND HIS DEDICATED HOSPIS NURSE PHIL PHARMA (PHILIP SEYMOUR HOFFMAN) IS TRYING TO HELP EARL FIND HIS LOST SON FRANK TJ MACKEY (A GREAT PERFORMANCE BY TOM CRUISE) WHO IS A MALE SUPREMICIST, IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ALL MALE SEMINAR.  FRANK HAS A LOT OF ANGER TOWARD EARL, BECAUSE WHEN FRANK WAS VERY YOUNG, HIS MOTHER, LILY, HAD CANCER, AND EARL WOULD LEAVE AND CHEAT ON HER, AND THEN LEFT FRANK TO TAKE CARE OF HER AS SHE DIED BESIDE HIM OF CANCER. HOWEVER, EARL WANTS TO SEE HIM BEFORE HE DIES, AND IS FULL OF GUILT ABOUT WHAT HE DID, BECAUSE HE REALLY LOVED HIS OLD WIFE, AND HIS NURSE IS DESPERATELY TRYING TO HELP EARL FIND HIS LOST SON.  MEANWHILE, EARL'S NEW WIFE LINDA PARTRIDGE (JULIANNE MOORE) IS TAKING ALL OF EARL'S PILLS HERSELF TO END HER SUFFERING, BECAUSE SHE TOO, CHEATED ON EARL, AND IS SEEKING FORGIVENESS.  AND AS THE STORY UNFOLDS ALL THE CHARACTERS INTERTWINE AS DO THEIR PAST.  PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON IS A GENIUS.  THE FILM IS SO WELL DRAWN OUT AND THE STORY IS TERRIFIC, AS ARE THE PERFORMANCES.  ESPECIALLY BY JEREMY BLACKMAN, JOHN C. REILY,  PHILIP BAKER HALL, AND WILLIAM H. MACY.  ALL IN ALL ITS A GREAT FILM, AND I'VE SEEN IT SIX TIMES, WHICH MEANS IF I WATCH IT ANOTHER TWO TIMES, ILL HAVE WASTED AN ENTIRE DAY OF MY LIFE.  THE DVD IS ALSO GREAT, WITH ITS DOUBLE DISC PLATINUM EDITION. I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE WHO IS SERIOUS ENOUGH AND WILLING TO SEE A GREAT AND POWERFUL (ALMOST BIBLICAL) MOVIE.  HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE AS IMMATURE AS THE PEOPLE ABOVE ME WHO GAVE THE FILM ONE AND TWO STARS, THEN STEP AWAY.  GOD, I CANT BELIVE WHAT A GOOD MOVIE THIS IS, WHAT MORE COULD I SAY.  WITHOUT IT, ID DIE.
B00004Y9PP|5.0|Director David Twohy has followed up a very good sci-fi film (THE ARRIVAL) with a great one. I'm not an action fan or a sci-fi fan in the least (I prefer a good foreign flick), but PITCH BLACK is as honest and artistic as anything else released this year. The movie is engaging on all levels, and has the unique ability to constantly surprise. In an age where 90% of action films go on autopilot, this is a movie that has put thought and originality into all levels of production. The visuals are stunning, and I'm not talking just about the special effects. Twohy uses an array of lenses and filters to create some beautiful and stunning landscapes. He also pays careful attention to the use of sound. Because a good portion of the film transpires in, well, pitch black, the sound design is important. The aliens' sonar is haunting and frightening, and those of you with surround sound systems will relish the grueling use of the rear channel speakers. A superb piece of entertainment, and one of the very best science fiction films since ALIEN.
B00003CX8J|5.0|Not only was the brilliant production of the movie done under a short time but so was the dvd...can you believe it's already coming now..anyhow. the blacks and cinematography of tom siegel should be great especially with the beautiful 5.1 dolby digital surround sound..for more info on this talented director, bryan singer. visit this awesome website. it has pictures, and dvd details in grand form [...]
B00004Z4WR|5.0|For years, Jerry Bruckheimer has rocked the movie scene with smash hits such as Armageddon, Enemy of the State, and Top Gun.  As we enter a new millennium of film-making (which, by the way, does not begin until 2001), Bruckheimer adds to the list of box office favorites with Gone in 60 Seconds and Coyote Ugly.  Both movies are excellent...chock full of action, drama, comedy....you name it, it's in there.  Gone in 60 Seconds is my personal favorite movie, mostly because I am an automobile fanatic.  However, there is much more to the film than just cars.  I admit that it was the cars and action that lured me to watch the film, but while watching the movie, I began to love it even more once I realized the underlying plot....brotherly love.  There are some who feel that this movie has no plot;  that it is merely a movie full of cars that go fast.  Those people are obviously wrong and I believe that Jerry  Bruckheimer himself would be outraged by such a claim.  The movie has a deep plot, and with that plot matched with the right mixture of drama, action, comedy, and exotic cars, Gone in 60 Seconds has earned its place among the all-time greatest movies.<br />For those of you who feel the need to bash Gone in 60 Seconds, or those who think it has no plot, or those who think the movie is horrible, you should also have the guts to reveal yourself instead of hiding like the cowards you are.<br />If you have any questions about the movie, my review, or if you have a problem with what I stated here, feel free to email me at esaidi@vt.edu.
0393317552|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It provides a compelling, non-racist argument as to why the world's dominant culture arose on the Eurasian landmass.  The book is worth reading simply for this reason.  On the other hand, Mr. Diamond seems to dodge the more difficult question of why it was the European culture, rather than the Arabian or Asiatic, that came to the forefront - for all three had the same advantages according to Diamond's thesis.  Still, this book is well written, interesting, informative, and a great conversation starter.
B000002C4J|5.0|This is a great follow up to her previous CD. It seems that all the cards were played on this one...using many major talents as Striesand, The Bee Gee's, and Pavorati. Seeing how this CD has the inclusion of &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, this CD is sure to be floating around for quite some time. For all you Celine fans out there, this is a must for your collection.
B0000048X8|5.0|I watched this movie last night for the second time. I had forgotten almost completely what It was about and as I watched it memories just kept comming back. This movie is so incredible!! Not only is the music fantastic, but they have the best assortment of actors! It was great! The Big Chill will always live on!
B000002TQV|5.0|if you still have not given in to peer pressure and listened to radiohead, there is still some time left. though their newest release, kid a, has been ripped by fans and glorified by critics-both sides can agree on this one. ok computer is considered the masterpiece, but the bends strikes me as much more personal (it is definitely one album i cannot live without). if you are new to radiohead, try this one out first. thom yorke manages to send chills up your spine with his completely distinctive and indescribably beautiful voice (one that we have not heard the likes of since the late freddy mercury). if i cannot convince you to get this by its critical acclaim alone, know this: you will not find a more complete or touching album from this decade. there is no question about it. buy this now. buy two copies. you will listen to it so much (it is a constant comfort for me on the road) that you'll need another one. i can guarantee that radiohead will become legends in their own right, if they haven't already. pick up a piece of history in the making.
B00004Y9PP|4.0|Sure, the plot is derivative and uneven in spots, but the visual effects used in Pitch Black are quite stunning in spots.  There is above average acting from a cast full of new-comers, and the plot DOES have some twists and turns that should keep your eyes open, even late at night.  Twohy has captured the &quot;post-modern&quot; technique (quick jumpshots, fluid-motion, color variations) quite well.  A good omen for the future of &quot;scinema.&quot;
B00003CWL6|5.0|What makes a movie worthy of a Best Picture Oscar is something that can not be placed on a check list.  You know it after it hits you.  Audiences didn't know how to react, take, or even discuss AMERICAN BEAUTY after it slapped them right out of their semi-comfortable theater chairs.<br />A movie such as this compells you to feel.  Regardless of what the emotion is, you walk away feeling something.  Many people are bothered that they can't stay stone-cold after seeing it.  And just like that feeling, you can't put your finger on why this movie won Best Picture.<br />Perhaps it's because cinematically we've never seen anything like it.  The story itself is primed for Springer: middle aged man goes through crisis, tries to sleep with daughter's best friend while wife sleeps with work competitor.  However, it is how the story is handled that makes it a tremendous step in film-making.  If you would rather not be bothered with color-symbolism and artistic expression in your movies, don't even see this one.  But if elegance and poetry of sight, color, word, and character draws you to a movie, this is your soon-to-be favorite.<br />Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey deliver terribly amazing performances.  Ms. Bening's obsessive and over-worked wife is dead on.  In a particular scene where she tries to sell a Brady-like house, you can't decide whether to laugh, cry, or hurt for her.<br />We should be able to relate to the desperate nature of these characters.  We are all restless beings.  That is our connection...not that we want to sleep with high school cheerleaders.  It is the human aspect painted with vibrant images and poetic storytelling that makes this a must-see.  It is that quality that I can only describe in round-about circles that makes this movie deserving of it's Best Picture win.
B00004Y635|4.0|I enjoyed the whole trilogy but the care and fun the actors put into their 3rd time with these characters was one of the best!  A lot of the time, the 2nd or 3rd movie in a continuing storyline is boring or just trash.<br />I own the first 2 and will buy the 3rd when it is available. I still watch them and giggle a heck of a lot of the time (even if it is to cover up scary parts).
B00004XOWM|4.0|how can you not like limp bizkit? fred durst's vocals aren't for everyone but their music itself is beautiful to listen to. this album is no better than significant other but it is no worse. i do feel their best song is &quot;take a look around&quot;. if you like limp bizkit (who doesn't?)get this album because it is great.
0780020901|5.0|This film has a lot of strengths which make it essential.<br />There are a lot of segments without dialogue in which Mahler's music is given visual settings. A Mahler music video, to put it crudely.  But the coordination between Mahler's music and these segments alone make this an essential film.  Another high point is the scene where Alma goes around and &quot;silences&quot; the countryside noises as Mahler incorporates them into his music.  (This is somewhat true, Mahler once told Bruno Walter he didn't have to look at the scenery because he already wrote them into his symphony.)<br />The &quot;conversion&quot; with the Cosima Wagner dominatrix is hilarious, although that will be offensive to some people. (Offensive, but true.  Long live the Truth!)<br />Having read Adorno and Carr on Mahler, there are a lot of small subtle details incorporated, such as Mahler's annoyance by everyday noises and his love for the smell of insense.<br />Given the tone of these books, I think this film does a good job portraying philosophical issues that surround Mahler's life and his works.<br />Above all, Maher is a genius and his music is powerful.  This film is an enhancement to enjoying Mahler's music.
6302759110|4.0|In the 1462 a young Prince Dracula (played by Oldman) goes off to fight againts the Turks.  During his absence his beloved wife Elizabetha (played by Ryder) fearing him dead throws herself from the castle turret.  Upon Draculas return he finds his beloved bride dead.  He is told that his brides soul can not be saved because she has choosen to take her own life.  Dracula, who is angry, hurt and confused, then renounces God and his faith.  He strikes his sword into a mightly cross and blood flows from the wound.  Dracula raises a goblet to the blood and drinks from it--becoming a vampire.<br />This is the opening sequence that is so expertly filmed and acted that it will forever be one of the defining moments in Bram Stokers Dracula.  The basic concept of the movie is simple:  Dracula after several hundreds of years finds Mina, a woman that so closely matches his image of his beloved Elizabetha that he is drawn to her.   However, the movie also contains many more subplots that add to the overall richness of the final product that is Bram Stokers Dracula.  <br />The screen play written by James V. Hart is a wonderful adaptation to the original Bram Stoker's classic.  Hart adds much more depth and subplot to the original story line.  Also, in Hart's adaptation he keeps the movie running on the original Bram Stoker concept of journal entries and letters.  Francis Ford Coppola's direction of the movie utilizes Hart's script and special effects to create a visual delight.  This combination of Coppola and Hart works out wonderfully.<br />The acting in this movie is varied.  Stellar preformances are delivered from Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins.  These three work both their dialogue and their actions together to create an excellent preformance.  Keanu Reeves preformance as the young Englishman Jonathan Harker is not that great.  His acting sticks out as a poor example against the rest of the cast.  Other notable preformances come from Sadie Frost, who plays the stunning and sexy Lucy, and Tom Waits, who plays the best Renfield ever.<br />This movie is without a doubt eye candy.  Eiko Ishioka, who designed the costumes, knew what she was doing.  The cotumes are a true visual delight.  Also, the set in the movie is surreal, dark, and fantasticly designed.  This movie creates some of the most beautiful vampires that I have ever seen.<br />I recommend that this movie be watched and appreciated for both its beauty and fine acting.  It is a haunting movie that uses dark images and certain sexuality to connect the viewer to the film.  This is an intriguing film that can not be missed.
0679879269|5.0|Let me begin by saying that this is the second best book i've ever read.  Yes, the second, after book one of the series, The Golden Compass.  This book is truly amazing. It was breathtaking how Phillip Pullman could have such small and quiet beauty (the mulefa scenes) and such astounding grandeur (the war with heaven, the land of the dead.) and both be so compelling and interesting.  I'll keep this review short because all you really need to know is that missing out on this book is a horrible mistake.<br />P.S.  Before reading this book you should know two things:  You really must read The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife to understand what goes on here, AND if you are offended by strong religious themes and story elements, you should probably not read this book.
6302759110|5.0|Francis Ford Coppolla's stylish, bloody vision of Bram Stoker's infamous novel borders on greatness.  Minor flaws (mostly performance wise) make this merely a good, beautiful Horror film.  Gary Oldman as the Count has got to be the best rendition of the character ever brought to life.  Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Van Helsing does a superb job.  Wynonna Rider as Mina is believable.  But then we get to Keanu Reeves, Mr. Mannequin himself.  Probably one of the worst casting mistakes in the history of film, Reeves plays Harker with all the passion of a rotting log, making an integral character annoying at best.  Thankfully his on screen time is limited and we can enjoy the eerie sliding motions of the Old Count, the crawling down the walls, the shadow an entity all its own.  The blood and gore levels are high, the effects truly astounding.  Purists  argue that too much liberty was taken with the source material, and in some areas I have to agree.  The level of the blossoming love between the Count and Mina was just a tad bit over the top, but we can't have the same movie over and over again.  Coppola's vision is all in all satisfying, loyal enough to its source to quench most Horror fans bloodthirst.  For some reason, taken as a whole, this film works.  I just calls 'em as I see 'em.  Required viewing for all the children of the night.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I am and have been a Green Day fan since the days of 39/Smooth, and have watched Green Day grow from a college band to the Kings of Punk Rock, to what they are now.  I have not listened to a single track on Warning that did not impress me.<br />But WARNING to Green Day fans, Green Day isn't punk rock anymore, be prepared when you buy this cd for Green Day at a different level.  I have to say, this is their best, particularly Castaway, Warning, Minority, and just about every track with the exception of &quot;Macy's Day Parade.&quot;<br />What I'm saying is, if you're ready for a new Green Day and better Green Day than you've EVER seen before....  just buy this cd it's awsome.
B00003CX7L|5.0|Alot of times sequels to movies are really bad, however this is not the case with Toy Story 2!!!  Being a Toy Story fan myself, I felt that this movie was a must-see for me.  Lots of interesting characters and plenty of humor made this movie an instant winner.  Children and adults of all ages will enjoy it!
6303168507|5.0|&quot;He who saves a single life saves the world entire.&quot;<br />This was the Talmudic verse that Itzhak Stern, the bookishly serious accountant/friend/conscience of Oskar Schindler quoted to him in one of the movie's final scenes.  <br />On the face of it, Oskar Schindler was the most unlikely hero one is ever likely to hear about.  Lusty, earthy, and sensual, he was a reckless philanderer, a gambler, a member of the Nazi party and someone who saw the war as an opportunity to become wealthy.  But to the Jews who were fortunate enough to encounter him, he was quite literally their saviour.<br />Spielberg succeeds with this film on two stupendous levels.  Firstly it is with the documentation of the humanisation and conscience of a man who originally saw the war as a personal opportunity and who, at the end of the 6 years, had gone bankrupt in his mission to save &quot;his&quot; Jews.  Secondly, and most disturbingly, it is with the graphic re-creation of some of the most horrific and barbaric acts ever committed by mankind, all in the name of prejudice and oppression.  Such is the reality of these scenes that viewers will feel outraged, afraid, paralysed, and oppressed.  Most of all, they will feel as if they too, had the supreme misfortune to be European Jews living under the dark cloud of prejudice and hatred that permeated the globe during the interminable period of the second world war.  And it will leave us asking the one answerable question - &quot;Why?&quot;<br />Perhaps, as Oskar Schindler viewed these scenes firsthand, that is how he too felt.  An odd dichotomy in his character enabled him to fraternise with high ranking Nazi officials, especially the demonic Amon Goeth, while, unlike Goeth and his peers, treating &quot;his&quot; Jews with the humanity and civility that was so scarce during this age of insanity, of loss, of suffering and death.  Never before or since has ethnic cleansing succeeded so brutally in decimating the population of an entire race.  We must pray that it never does again.<br />Schindler's story has risen like a phoenix from the ashes of this dark time.  It is a story of hope, courage, and survival.  But more than that it is the story of a man who chose good over evil, who chose love over hate, who chose understanding over prejudice.  Is it any wonder that a tree on the Avenue of the Righteous bears his name?<br />There are a few names which have become branded in our psyche as being synonymous with the horrors of the Holocaust.  Anne Frank, whose diary etched her life and death into the hearts of millions, Simon Wiesenthal, himself an Auschwitz survivor who lost over 80 family members in the death camps, and now of course, there is Oskar Schindler, a man who was far from saintly, but a man whose deeds guaranteed him a place in heaven.  A man who &quot;saved the world entire.&quot;
B00003CWL5|5.0|Life.  That is what this movie is all about.  It is about who we are, what we project ourselves as, and most importantly what we deny ourselves in order to appear a certain way to the outside world.  This is a great movie.  Its plot twist and turns.  Its characters change and grow before our eyes.  Its filming and direction  by Sam Mendes is smart, witty, and beautiful.  This film is worth seeing once, and then worth seeing again.<br />This film and its characters will remind you of both people you know and yourself.  This story is about a &quot;typical&quot; American family.  Lester Burnham (played by Academy Award winning Kevin Spacey) and his wife Carolyn Burnham (played by Academy Award Nominee Annette Bening) are a so-called happily married couple.  They live with their daughter in a nice house in American suburbia.  Their lives are all normal...and then it all changes for them.  I can't say much more because one of this movies best features is it twists in the plot and how each character changes throughout the movie.<br />I must warn everyone thought that some of the issues this movie deals with aren't for the timid.  Also, this movie deals with both images and topics that aren't really appropriate for the younger viewing audience.  This is an adult movie--and a very good one at that.  Both Spacey and Bening's preformances are wonderful.  Spacey makes you feel what his character is all about.  Bening's preformance as Carolyn is sometimes overstated and maybe a little overacted.  The other charcters in the movie also do a fantastic job with their parts.
B00003CX95|5.0|there is nothing to say about this film.mel gibson made a good job to play william wallace and direct this movie.I was inspired by this,excellent movie.BUY THIS MOVIE AND KEEP FOREVER!!!
B00000JPHF|5.0|Frankenstein, after almost 70 years, can still lay claim to being a scary Horror film.  Which is more than I can say for the Bela Lugosi Dracula.  Colin Clive plays the doctor so believably and so sincere that he is the definition of the character on film.  The set design, the dark atmosphere.  Take for instance the grave robbing scene, I can't imagine how controversial that must have been when this film was released.  And the idea of reanimating flesh of the dead to make it living!  I am actually amazed the film was even allowed to be released.  The accidental murder of the little girl (the monster thought she would float, she was such a pretty flower after all) and the subsequent scene with the father carrying the dead child's corpse through the town, showing the townsfolks reaction.  Karloff as the monster is deservedly the vision conjured at the name of Frankenstein, he played the lumbering creature with a sympathetic flair.  But what made this movie what it is was the direction by James Whale, truly a genius of his time.  Frankenstein is the epitome of Horror classic and this movie is essential viewing for anybody who call themselves Horror fans.
B000002JST|5.0|AC/DC picked out the perfect name also.  This band had power back then.  Back in Black was and is still good,  but they lack the power and bite of the Bon Scott years.  Don't get me wrong I still hail BIB as one of the best.  But Bon Scott had a powerful growl that will never be approached.  This album just isn't as popular and that really doesn't matter.  There is more energy here.  Whole lotta Rosie is my all time favorite.  What an intro.  Bon Scott is missed and Brian Johnson has guts for stepping out there to do his best.  For any fan that lacks this in their collection,  grab it and get ready to Rock.
B00004XMTH|5.0|This video of Cats is the best version of the show I have seen to date. I am a Cats addict and I have seen the show over 15 times with various casts, between London, Broadway and Japan. I think the cast assembled on this video is the best I have seen (more than just &quot;competent&quot; as the editorial review said).<br />The only person I was not too keen on was the choice of John Mills, because of whom the excellent &quot;Growltiger's Last Stand&quot; was taken out. John Mills was great, don't get me wrong, but I wish Gus was played by someone who could have pulled this part off. I was very disappointed to see this part of the show taken out, as it was one of my favourites, and because of that some of the best performers on the video which are in this scene had their screen time shortened.  Even so, the rest of the video is great. I did not get the commemorative edition, so I cannot comment on the &quot;extras&quot;. I did not get it as I am not sure what exactly is on it.   But the video of the show itself is fabulous because of the great cast - Michael Gruber is the strongest Munkustrap I have ever seen, Veerle Casteleyn is the cutest Jemima yet, Jo Bingham is adorable as Etcetera, John Partridge plays Rum Tum Tugger the way I always thought he should be played, Jacob Brent is absolutely amazing as Mistoffelees, Phyllida Crowley Smith is the most amazing dancer, Elaine Paige goes without saying, and I will not go on cause you get the message. Anyway, it took me a while before I bought this video, cause I wasn't sure if the atmosphere of the show would transfer well on the video, but it does cause of the amazing cast, and the fact that there are many close ups. Don't miss out on it, you won't be disappointed!
B00004U30D|5.0|Among my collection of 43 Oscar-winning Best Picture films (from &quot;All About Eve&quot; to &quot;West Side Story&quot;), I have to say that &quot;American Beauty&quot; (which has been in my collection for two months before it comes out on VHS and DVD) is an excellent ode to fathers who are very unhappy. It takes a sort of satiric look at how our lives really are. We all can identify with most of the characters. We laugh and cry, we think and sympathize, we remember and never forget. In the cases of Lester and Carolyn Burnham (Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening), Robin Hood Trail's &quot;unordinary&quot; ordinary couple, we see their once happy union crumble before our eyes. Their daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), a sad, alienated girl with no happiness in her life. She takes comfort in her oversexed, but obviously ordinary friend Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) and her voyeuristic, drug dealing boyfriend Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley, a very boring actor!). In the house next door is the Fitts family; Marine Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper) and Barbara Fitts (Alison Janney), along with son Ricky. When everyone's secrets, which is the climax of the film, is revealed, they are all affected by it. Which leads to Lester being shot dead by Colonel Fitts, who is really a latent homosexual; Carolyn's only chance at happiness with her lover, fellow real estater Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher) is destroyed when Lester discovers them fooling around, literally; Jane and Angela are no longer friends; Jane decides to run away with Ricky, who is thrown out of his house by his abusive father. This film obviously affected many critics and people as well; enough to garner five Oscars for Picture, Director, Actor, Screenplay, and Cinematography. This is definitely a film that is among the great tragicomedies such as &quot;The Apartment,&quot; &quot;Annie Hall,&quot; and &quot;Terms of Endearment.&quot; To make us laugh and cry is an amazing accomplishment which, lucky for these four films, they havedone with precision and taste.
0684853523|5.0|This book has replaced &quot;Bird By Bird&quot; by Anne Lamott as my all time favorite book about the craft of writing.  Stephen King gets down to the nitty gritty with practical, sensible advice to would-be writers with lots of examples from his own experiences.<br />I particularly enjoyed the autobiographical accounts of his childhood and early years.  The stories were funny and melancholy, uplifting and inspiring.  The poison ivy incident with his brother was worth the price of the book and had me laughing and chuckling for days.<br />The last chapter describing the details of his near-fatal accident was fascinating.  I now admire Mr. King not only as an excellent author, but as a survivor.  His life story shows that just because you have money and success doesn't necessarily mean that you're immune from heartache, pain and tragedy.  Thank God that he survived that horrible accident to finish this book and share his hard-earned wisdom with us all.  Everyone should read this book, whether you're interested in writing or not, then pass it on to a friend.
B000002JSV|5.0|It took me years to add Powerage to my collection and the only reason I can think of was that I was focused on all of the other great albums.  This is a great one.  It does lack a great big hit but all of the tunes are really good and none are lame.  Bon Scott has a voice that was built for Rock and Roll.  No disrespect to Brian Johnson,  but he doesn't even come close to the powerful growl of Bon.  It is too bad alcohol and drugs destroyed him.  I would imagine many fans don't have this album.  Don't make that mistake anymore.  Add this to your collection and get ready to Rock.
0452279488|5.0|This book was great. Once I started to read it, I could not put it down. I just had to find out who wrote the letter. The reason I am writing this review is that I was not disappointed at all by the ending. If I read a review of a book and see that someone was disappointed with an ending, I ususally do not buy the book. There were so many great things about this book - mentioned in the other reviews so I won't repeat. I'm giving it 5 stars because it was funny, thought-provoking, and surprising.

0783246641|2.0|People can pat themselves on the back for being &quot;elite&quot; enough to like this movie and decide in their smugness that only they are smart enough to appreciate this work...but in the end the truth is, this movie just isn't very good.  There is no attempt to determine why Patrick Bateman is killing people, why he would have become so out of control, etc.  It's just pointless talk about 80s singers and killing people.  After the initial shock wears off...the movie just becomes silly.  Chasing people around naked with a chainsaw isn't high-brow humor...it's just dumb.  I tried to determine if there was some sort of connection between the songs that Patrick played for his victims and their final fate - but I could not see a link.  Maybe there was one and I just missed it, but you would think if they were going to go to all the trouble of making it in obvious point that he likes 80s pop music - that the songs would tie-in someway to the killer's state of mind or his life or be some sort of guide to the movie in general. In the end, they did not add up - like most of this movie.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson has made his masterpiece with Magnolia, a daring movie that may forever change the way we look at motion pictures.  <br />Magnolia deals with a variety of subjects:  coincidence, redemption, forgiveness, loneliness, and love-all with incredible understanding and empathy.  The whole of the movie is greater than the sum of its ensemble cast parts.  As many know, Tom Cruise received a well-deserved best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his part as a multimedia sex guru with a painful past.  But there are so many other affecting performances in this picture, like John C. Reilly as a lonely police officer, Melora Walters as his coke-sniffing love interest, William H. Macy as a former quiz-kid, Jason Robards as Cruise's dying father and Phillip Seymour Hoffman as his male nurse-just to name a few.  Paul Thomas Anderson's direction brings out inspired performances from everyone in the cast.<br />One of the most touching and emotional parts in Magnolia is the &quot;Wise Up&quot; sequence, set to Aimee Mann's incredibly haunting song.  It must be experienced to be believed.  Mann's songs are used extensively in the excellent soundtrack, as well as a couple of vintage Supertramp compositions-&quot;The Logical Song&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot;.<br />A word of warning to the viewer.  Magnolia is not the kind of motion picture that one can sit through and be entertained.  Thinking and introspection are required.  But if you invest your time and emotion, the payoff is worth it-even at three hours plus in length.<br />The DVD is chock full of features and includes a second disc that includes Aimee Mann's &quot;Save Me&quot; video, trailers, and a video diary of the making of Magnolia.
1577311523|4.0|An excellent book about the benefits of being present and living in the moment.  Also an excellent review of strategies and techniques for developing presence.  My only problem with the book is that Tolle equates immortality with eternality.  He suggests that the experience of timelessness proves that one's being lives forever.  He claims to know that his being will survive the death of his brain and physical body.  I agree with him that his being is immortal, in the sense that it will never experience \\"I am not\\" and that it always experiences \\"I am,\\" but I don't agree that it survives beyond the physical death.  To me that's just wishful thinking.  Tolle also suggests that reincarnation is a fact, that nothing real ever dies or changes and that all things are conscious or are in consciousness.  Again I simply disagree and haven't seen any evidence to convince me otherwise.  I believe that consciousness is a byproduct of the brain and nervous system, that matter exists whether we are conscious of it or not, and that reality is a process that is constantly changing.  In the end I guess it doesn't really matter who is right.  The bottom line is that learning to be present and living in the moment has many advantages and benefits and Tolle's book will definitely help you get there.
0375704027|5.0|Writing a review of this book is more difficult than dealing with how it made me feel, so I'll stay away from spelling out the entire plot and just say this: after reading it, allow yourself to be immobile.  I needed time to think, to stare, to just breathe afterwards because it was so striking.  Murakami's words create perfect pictures without becoming too descriptive, and the  thoughts he pulls out of the reader tend to suck the energy out for a little while.  While the story is simple in its most basic form, it is complex in the range of emotions the characters experience.  It's one of those books you need to have on your shelf to read and reread again and again, and it's so moving that you'll probably want to share it with all your friends.
0312243022|5.0|Here's a book that starts and ends at a very leisurely pace. It's deceptively clever, beautifully executed, and gripping in a quiet way. If you're still thinking about a book a day, or a week, or a month after you've read it, that book has very definitely succeeded. This book made me want to know more about Virginia Woolf (and I thought I'd read everything about her). It also made me care about characters I initially thought were static. But the considerations of life and death are provocative, simply stated and yet very profound. I pay the author the greatest compliment in saying that, at the end, I was entirely caught up in the lives depicted, and I'm still thinking about the book.
052594527X|4.0|Only 232 pages, I looked this book over carefully before beginning. I was trying to go to a place in my mind, the kind of place where I am drawn to, say, a small but powerful painting in a museum. So I did go there and experience a moment in time with the author as she passed through the home and family of the painter Vermeer in the Netherlands, circa 1660's. My guide was a young maid, Griet, who worked hard and caught the eye of the great painter. She fell in love in a simple romantic way, as she yearned to mix the palette colors of the Master, Vermeer, to be close to his aura of genius, and to him. She began to notice the simplest detail as he painted, viewing his compositions in her own eye. The story takes this young maid to the brink of fate, when she becomes one of his paintings. He adds one final touch, his wife's pearl earring, a touch that will perfect this work. But it is the end, for once the wife sees the painting she will know about her husband and the young maid. It matters not that the &quot;affair&quot; was never consummated. Such things weren't done in a society so rigidly structured. Griet realizes that she must leave this unhappy home before she disappears into the vision of the painter and his lust for images.
B000001G6W|2.0|This was my first recording of Beethoven's Ninth.  While it has its moments, notably in the finale, I believe there are serious flaws to it that comparison with other great recordings will immediately reveal.  This is Karajan's third recording of the Ninth; he would go on to make one more.  The 1970's and 1980's were what I call his &quot;sheen and gloss&quot; period; that is, during these last twenty years of his life, Karajan became concerned with lusciousness of texture as an end in itself.  While many people may like this beautiful sound, and it is undeniably beautiful, I don't.  After listening to a performance of a mighty work like the Beethoven Ninth, I expect to emerge emotionally drained but happy.  After listening to this recording, or to his &quot;Tristan und Isolde,&quot; or any other recording from this period, I feel myself thinking, &quot;That was nice.&quot;  I can't really point out any physical attribute of Karajan's performance that is either lacking or unnecessary; it's the overall intensity and emotion that communicates to me as a listener - in this case, not much.  Similarly, the Berlin Philharmonic plays gorgeously, but there's not much behind the playing.  It sounds to me as though Karajan has knocked all the life out of the piece by over-rehearsing.  However, many people may find this attractive.  It's inexpensive, gets some fine vocal work (particularly from Anna Tomowa-Sintow and Jos van Dam), and does sound beautiful.  The Vienna Singverein sings excellently (I can't understand the complaint about them below).  But in the end, I just don't get much out of this recording.  If you want a modern recording, my top choice is Sir Colin Davis with the Staatskapelle Dresden on Philips.  I'm not sure that's available separately, though; even though I haven't heard it, I feel safe in recommending Abbado's second version, with Eaglen, Meier, Heppner and Terfel.  But if you want the BEST recording, regardless of sound, go for Furtwngler on EMI.
B00004XOWM|3.0|I can't lie, I was one of the many people who totally accused Limp Bizkit of selling out after &quot;Significant Other&quot;, and I just hated them after that. And, truthfully, they did sell out, as Wes sort of admitted in an interview. But they've gone back to having more of that raw vibe they had on the first album on some of the tracks, and it is much heavier and more rock-oriented than &quot;Significant Other&quot;. Fred Durst isn't the best lyricist, but he wasn't that great on the first album either, so I don't want to dis him too much, even though he didn't write stuff as stupid as &quot;Rollin&quot; on the first album. Dont get me wrong, it's an ok track, but the lyrics just suck. So if you're one of the many who accused them of selling out, you may find some good stuff on here, but I don't think we can ever expect them to go back to the sound they had on &quot;Three Dollar Bill Y'all&quot;.
1558801871|5.0|This was one of Spikes most precious works.  He encompassed the true jazz enthusiast with his radical message for equality.  I cannot wait to hear the sharp jazz pieces that this movie could provide on a DVD.
B00004XONN|4.0|While not on the level of the incomparable &quot;OK Computer&quot;, this is still an excellent CD.  This band has so much talent that they simply have no contemporary peers.  They have - perhaps unwittingly - created an expectation that was, in the case of Kid A, almost impossible to live up to when you consider &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; are probably 2 of the best 5 CD's ever recorded.  <br />Give credit to Radiohead for venturing out into the netherworld on this one and continuing to take creative risks.  You must listen to Kid A several times before it can be fully appreciated. Some will &quot;get it&quot;; some won't.  If you're in to the ear candy that is so prevalent in today's alt-music scene, this won't do it for you.  If you you can appreciate genre-bending work in the vein of the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and REM, you'll understand why Radiohead is the best rock act going by a wide margin.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I had high expectations for this album.  But, as oft is the case the band failed to live up to expectations.  When they failed to find lyrics they often fell back on catch phrases from their last album.  The music just isn't there.  Granted it is loud, but as I said above they seemed to just rely on their past performance, rather than produce powerful tunes.  Not catchy.  Limp.
0446677450|5.0|This is a good book, because it stresses what John Paul Getty said, &quot;If you want to get rich, work for yourself.&quot; I like how he stresses that he doesn't LOVE is work. He only really enjoys his free time. That's refreshing honesty. He points out how he made a lot of money in projects that took little effort. He points out that living cheaply one you are wealthy, is stupid. (We're supposed to be in awe of how Ross Perot gets the same $5.00 hair cut he did before he was rich. Splurge, Ross!)
B00004XONN|4.0|I feel compelled to comment because of all the hype. I see the people trashing this CD and it makes me mad. Those people are just ignorant and closed minded. But what makes me actually want to cry are the people here claiming that Radiohead has reinvented music or something.  Those people are just ignorant and open minded.  People!  Before you start making declarations like that you really should check history and check fact. Steve Reich and Brian Eno and many others were doing this a long time ago.... and Godspeedyoublackemperor and Mogwai and Sigur Ros (amazing) are doing it today.  Wake up!   Yes - this is a fantasitc CD and a graceful step up and up for the artists of Radiohead.  In fact, this may be one of the best CDs of the year.  And Radiohead may be one of the best bands of our time.   But lets keep things in perspective.
6303314015|3.0|Ok, I'm losing patients with Disney(thought I do admit I never had much to begin with).  The Lion Kind is very strong in some places but at the same time is very weak.  The animation is excellent, some of the best to ever come out of Disney and the majority of the cameos are perfectly cast.  However, The Lion Kind feels very recycled.  The best example of this is the films villian Scar.  Simply put, he looks and sounds almost exactly like Jafar did in Aladin(except he's a lion of course).  Also while the film has a decent opening(though rather familiar) and a fairly well-done ending, there really isn't much of a middle to it.  The Lion King is a good movie but doesn't deserve all the praise it has gotten.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Let's just say that I like to keep my shi- on the downlow, and I'm about as pale as it gets (a lot of bruthas call me &quot;Ghostie&quot;).  So I was really happy to find out that there's other guys out there like me who are keepin' it real.  I had never heard of Limp Bizkit until recently, but a certain bizness associate of mine said that I dressed a lot like Fred Durst, and should check out this CD....which I did!<br />Well, I haven't been the same since.  Limp Bizkit are real diverse - they combine white music (rock) and black music (rap) for their own original style, which I call &quot;rap-metal&quot;.  It's cool music to party to (&quot;Nookie&quot;), but also great to sit back and really reflect on life (&quot;Think About It&quot;).  Limp Bizkit are of those rare groups that are gonna stand the test of time like the Beatles or Sugar Hill Gang.  I'm psyched that I'm one of the first people in my 'hood to peep the Bizkit.  They kick a--!!!

B00002EPJH|5.0|After dozens of disks of standards played with his wonderful trio, Keith Jarrett recorded this disk at home by himself.  This record can take you deep into the center of your mind.

0679731377|5.0|Not that reviews are generally easy to write but attempting to package &quot;History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters&quot; is next to impossible.  Barnes plays with the fundamental ideas of post-modernism in this work:  subjectivity versus objectivity.<br />We are treated to the woodworms' view of history as well as some rather gruesome aspects behind a rather famous painting.  All aspects point out that one's perspective of the &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;what really happened&quot; might not even be a valid idea, let alone how much to trust any statments on such matters.<br />Barnes' style is quiet and he lets you form your own ideas.  The book is quite enjoyable to read and I have gone through my copy several times over the years.
B0000046X0|5.0|This record is an ur-text for fusion music.  This is the only release of this version of Return to Forever.  Before, it was a Latin jazz combo; after, Al DiMeola took the guitar spot vacated by Bill Connors.  But Connors is one of the reasons this particular disc is so worth hearing.  Buy this album and hear where fusion really took off.
B00004U8H4|3.0|If Mary Harron's film has the slightest chance of being regarded as a success, it will only be seen as such by viewers unfamiliar with Bret Easton Ellis's novel.<br />The Ellis novel was relentlessly downbeat, its occasional black humour registering entirely intellectually. Flashes of brutal wit jolt the reader from the otherwise deliberate numbing produced by his obsessive-compulsive villain's soliloquays. Ellis's world is claustrophobic, oppressive: one in which every character is a monster of greed and moral apathy. Patrick Bateman is distinguished from his peers only by his commission of sickeningly and inventively brutal murders.<br />For all the disco-ball glamour of Bateman's world, the utter crassness of his monied yuppie compatriots undercuts any sense of a reader's vicarious envy. In any one of Ellis's setpiece exclusive restaurants, the maitre-d' is shockingly rude in the ugly American sense (as oppposed to a stereotypically highbrow French or English sense), the waitresses are surly and incompetent, and the nearby diners speak far too loudly about nothing but money and shopping. The most expensive evening in Manhattan turns out to be a very unpleasant experience indeed.<br />Harron very wrongly plays &quot;American Psycho&quot; for its 'comedy'. The atmosphere of its opening scene is reminiscent of an opera bouffe, as the credits are spelled in what first appears to be blood and is soon shown to be a berry sauce drizzled over elaborately presented food at--a cinematic and novelistic leitmotif---an exclusive restaurant.<br />The film is surprisingly non-violent on an explicit level, almost as much so as the novel was graphic. Harron perhaps dodged some ratings issues, in addition to a great deal of political flack, with her use of implied and off-screen violence, and much less of it at that than occurs in the Ellis story. However necessary such a choice may have been from the point of view of marketing, however, Harron loses a critical dimension of grittiness and actual (not only spiritual) horror. Bateman's madness and detached curiosity (according to Ellis) are explicated in the novel through the agency of his treatment of corpses, his forays into dissection and cannibalism.<br />Harron similarly airbrushes the grinding poverty, filthiness, and random, miscellaneous unpleasantnesses from Manhattan's streets. Tellingly, Ellis's novel begins with Bateman's judgemental observation of street people, depraved graffiti and garbage, as seen from a taxi window. Harron's film shows none of that, except in the brief meeting between Bateman and a beggar, a scene very much toned down from the novel.<br />One can only imagine how disasterous the once-rumoured casting of Leonardo diCaprio as Bateman might have been. DiCaprio's slender, unthreatening frame and distinctive facial beauty would have made it impossible either to fear him or to mistake him for others, as constantly happens in the plot of both the novel and the film.<br />Patrick Bateman, in Ellis's protrayal, is so flawlessly groomed and generically, nearly featurelessly handsome that he is occassionally taken for any vapidly perfect male model.<br />Harron chose Christian Bale well as a physical presence. He wears his designer suits with the oblivious comfort of the well-born, and his nearly perfect face is oddly forgettable. There is something enigmatic and seemingly incomplete about Bale's physiognomy: even watching direct shots of him taken at close-range, one has the sense of seeing something obliquely, as if part of his face were constantly obscured, or faceted ever so slightly out of the line of vision. Bale's lovely face is indeed one which, as the plot and characterization require, could be mistaken for that of any other equally handsome man.<br />The choice of a British actor for Bateman, however talented he may be, no doubt appeared to be a good idea in the initial casting process. Few American actors would appreciate the hyper-sensitivity to class issueswhich Ellis's Bateman ruminates on, endlessly and disdainfully, nor could they easily generate his droit de seigneur bearing.<br />There is, however, the very unfortunate matter of Bale's attempted American accent. Bale clearly spent mucht time studying the particular nasal bray of the Andover-Harvard aristocracy, but he never once pulls it off, sounding instead as if he had a slight speech impediment. Given that Bale is the lead, this constant distraction is most unfortunate for the film overall.<br />By soft-shoeing the hideousness of Bateman's acts; by relatively normalizing the members of his social circle; and by completely removing the other, darker, despairing New York from Bateman's designer world, Harron does much to reduce her lead to a bizarre but meaninglessly destructive cipher.<br />Unfortunately, Ellis's extraordinary sensitivity to sociological phenomena is rarely in evidence here. The more conflicted, intelligent, 'deeper' Bateman which Ellis so carefully constructs as a sort of human 'cautionary tale' ends up as something like the evil twin of Christian Bale's smirking, guffawing incarnation.ues which Ellis's Bateman ruminates on, endlessly and disdainfully, nor could they easily generate his droit de seigneur bearing. <br />There is, however, the very unfortunate matter of Bale's attempted American accent.

B00001NFCY|1.0|This cd was AWFUL. i was going to buy it but i listened to my brother's copy and now i m glad i didn't. All of the songs except for &quot;Higher&quot; and &quot;arms Wide open&quot; were just this guy screaming something over and over. (if you've listened to &quot;What If&quot; you have to admit it sounds like he's screaming  WERD ERF! WERD ERF!  over and over.) And all the songs sounded like that! Unless you like that kind of thing over actual music, you should NOT  but this cd. if you like &quot;Higher&quot; and &quot;Arms Wide Open,&quot; get the singles.
B000003TAR|5.0|This album - Nirvana's second and last - is (take a deep breath) a heart-wrenchingly sad, bleak, disillusioned, depressing, violent, harsh, raw, angst-ridden, disturbing, dissonant yet melodic, beautiful, powerful masterpiece by arguably the greatest (though short-lived) band of the 1990s - Nirvana - and its deeply troubled (and incomparably talented) leader, Kurt Cobain.  Absolutely brilliant (and sorry for the run-on first sentence)!   Although ALL the songs are excellent, I personally think that the best ones are (in order): 1) \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\"; 2) \\"All Apologies\\"; 3) \\"Dumb\\"; 4) \\"Rape Me\\"; 5) \\"Serve the Servants; 6) \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", then the other ones in no particular order.    Memorable/great lyrics (again, among many others) include:  \\"Teenage angst has paid off well, now I'm bored and old\\"; \\"I tried hard to have a father but instead I had a Dad\\"; \\"Rape me, my friend\\"; \\"She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak, I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for a week\\";  \\"I miss the comfort in being sad\\"; &quot;I'm not like them, but I can pretend&quot;; \\"I think I'm dumb, or maybe just happy\\"; \\"My heart is broke, but I have some glue, help me inhale, and mend it with you\\"; \\"I'm not like them, but I can pretend\\"; \\"I'm very ape and very nice\\"; \\"I am my own parasite, I don't need a host to live\\"; \\"Sit and drink Pennyroyal Tea, I'm anemic royalty\\"; \\"Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld, where I can sigh eternally\\";  \\"What else should I be, all apologies\\"; \\"I wish I was like you, easily amused\\"; \\"all in all is all we are\\".....<br />Is this a \\"fun\\" album or anything like the mindless pop pouring through our radios today like sticky, sickly sweet molasses?  Of course not (thank god)!  And despite its harsh (but NOT homophobic, racist, misogynistic trash like a lot of today's &quot;music&quot;) subject matter, it still has plenty of great melodic hooks - a tribute to Kurt Cobain's musical genius.   Sadly, this album has been seen by many as merely reflecting Kurt Cobain's deep emotional problems.  That's sad, because it makes \\"In Utero\\" about Cobain, instead of about society, and ultimately, all of US!.  The bottom line is that, however he did it and from whatever sources of pain (or not), Kurt Cobain and his bandmates were able to create and record some great music here.  And it's important to state that just because Cobain was deeply troubled does NOT mean that his vision, what he had to say, or the way he said it was wrong in any way.  In fact, the opposite statement (that Cobain had SUCH a clear vision of the world in large part BECAUSE he was so \\"troubled\\") is probably at least, if not more, accurate, in my opinion!   <br />Whatever the case may be, apparently one thing is for sure, and that is that music alone wasn't enough (the fame part may have been too much) for Cobain to achieve inner peace (let alone &quot;Nirvana&quot;), and we all know the tragic result.  And the greatest part of the tragedy is that the world lost a brilliant (and unique) musician, poet, even a revolutionary (think John Lennon, Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, etc.).  The loss of Kurt Cobain at such a young age was as great a loss -- or even greater -- than any other in the history of popular culture.  Just sit, drink some Pennyroyal Tea, listen closely to \\"In Utero\\" (read the lyrics, too) and you'll understand why...

Haunt the paperback racks. Read especially Richard Matheson's stories, novels,watch his screen and TV writing. Acknowledge he is your great inspiration. Then steal the bejesus out of him and so many others. Too many examples to list here.Wait for the next generation. Steal from older better writers your current young readers are rarely familiar with or haven't heard of. Rip off, badly, Rod Serling's &quot;Odyssey of Flight 33&quot;, among others, piece it into &quot;The Langoliers.&quot; Have plane passengers in time warp say things like &quot;this is just like that Twilight Zone.&quot; Of course it is, you scmucks, that's where King stole this from. Tack on a Theodore Sturgeon story to this--and another bestseller. Take, among so many of his rip offs of Matheson, the sixties story, &quot;The Distributor&quot;, couple it with Charles Beaumont's &quot;The Intruder&quot; and you have &quot;Needful Things.&quot; Steal and trash an episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, warp it with ridiculous plot turns and trash &quot;Old Joe Cotten&quot; in the process. How sad so many of King's readers will never read the real works, of which his is a very pedestrian rehashing. Whenever anyone asks King if he has gentle feelings, he says time and again, &quot;Yes, I have the heart of a nine year old boy. I keep it in a jar on my desk.&quot; That is an outright steal from Robert Bloch, a far better writer who was hurt so much of his life by con artists. Why Matheson does not call King on these things baffles me. How Harlan Ellison, whose brilliant creative fearless mind is an encyclopedia of all he's read and who is eager to nail re-treads doesn't lambast this rather glumpy writer also is very puzzling.  How King can do this, especially to his prime inspiration, Matheson, make a ton of money off work that is stolen,seems to lead one to expect a great lack of conscience. Oh yes, Stephen hasn't ripped off, to my knowledge, Matheson's &quot;The Shrinking Man&quot;. Tabitha did that with her first novel, &quot;Small World.&quot;work that is stolen,seems to lead one to expect a great lack of conscience. Oh yes, Stephen hasn't ripped off, to my knowledge, Matheson's &quot;The Shrinking Man&quot;. Tabitha did that with her first novel, &quot;Small World.&quot;

B00000J6AG|3.0|Moby's 'Play' CD is a real treat - loads of great tracks.  However, the quality of the recording is among the worst I've ever heard.  The recording quality is so bad that I can only listen to the CD in my car - it's off limits to my high-end stereo set-up.  'Porcelain', one of the best tracks on the CD is a case in point - great music but the background noise/hiss is so prevelant that I wonder whether it was introduced onto the track on purpose for some warped reason.  Music rating - 5stars, but the quality is the worst of all my 200 CDs, and so I must call attention to this dramatic flaw - overall rating 3stars (Moby, do yourself and everyone else a favor and get another recording company!!)

I'm glad they are putting the Metallica , I Dissapear video on the DVD, but why arn't they putting the Limp Bizkit Take a Look Around(MI-2 Theme) on it.  I just watched the Take a look around video and thought it is so much cooler than the I dissappear video. If they included the Limp Bizkit video, this would get 5 stars.
0684853523|2.0|I call myself a big fan of Stephen King. I've read all his books, watched all the filmes, wrote essays in school about him, etc. When you read a lot of books by him, you get the feeling to know this man. This comes from his personal forewords and books like 'Danse Macabre'. He's a funny guy you think and an interesting one. So, what could be more interesting than a book he has written about himself and his writing? Well, a lot.<br />I was very excited to hear about this book and, exactly like all the other times, I ran to the bookstore and bought it, just when it was published. It's quite thin and I wondered again if this is really worth this much money. I've read it in nearly one day and was left with a feeling of confusion.<br />Alright, the stories about his life were pretty interesting and funny, although I really can't hear the 'Carrie'-legend anymore. But the part about writing is strange and boring. I write myself, you know, and was also happy to get some tips. But I really can't say he helped me. What astonishes me the most, is the fact that he neverever says: &quot;Well, that's how I do it, look for your own way.&quot; He seems to be convinced that his way is the right way. I don't think so. A notebook was always helpful to me, no matter what he says. And eight pages a day is impossible for me. And his talks about grammars, adverbs, etc. are somehow ridiculous. I mean, you should know grammar if you write, and if you don't it won't matter, I think. If you really want to be an author and want to tell a story, it will work somehow. I don't know, it's as if King wants to say there is this style and this way to do it - finito.<br />The story about his accident was interesting, but somehow unecessary. It got the book more pages, but in fact. And I wouldn't have mind to read the whole story, he starts to write. Isn't it enough, that he seems to want more and more money the older he becomes. I think so, and it makes me really sad. I liked him really and I still love most of his books. But if he won't start to write something really good soon, I can't keep my sympathy up.<br />I don't think this book is necessary for authors or King-fans. Since I'm both, I think I can say this. It's nice to read but not very helpful in any way.

0671042858|2.0|I don't know if this was exclusive in Germany, but the book was published in a plastic case, as if the book shouldn't touch air or whatever. I don't know what this means, but it was... yes, unecessary. After I've read the book, I thought about it again and thought, well, maybe they wanted to give you something more, to make the money worth. The book doesn't really.<br />The story of a girl lost in the woods could be an interesting premise. When I read the premise before the book was pubished, I didn't jump because excitement and yelled: &quot;What a wonderful idea.&quot; It is no revolutionary idea and the book isn't too. It's interesting to read how Trisha survives in the wood and it's exciting too. You really want to know what will happen. But after two thirds I thought, well how should this book end. Since King doesn't give us anything else than the girl in the wood, what will he do to finish his book? Well, what he does in the end ruined the book for me totally. It was surely the most hilarious end from King I've ever read. It has no sense, no meaning, no whatever. It leaves you with nothing, nothing to think about, or laugh or cry. Just nothing.<br />I'm not against King writing serious novels (if you don't call horror serious), I always defended him, when someone said he's a horror-author. But books like this makes it hard for me to defend. King can do it much much much better and has done, but this one is thin, senseless and disappointing in the end. Enjoy it to the last ten pages, put it away and think about and ending yourself. Maybe this is more fun.
B000002USN|3.0|I also am one of the legion of devotees of The Chairman of the Board.  This disc has some of his greatest works, done of course with a collection of &quot;friends&quot;.  I do think this could have made a much better effort had Frank and his compadres recorded these songs together, as opposed to so doing in separate studios listening to one another on tape.  Bringing the singers together (in my opinion) would have helped create some real magic.<br />Having said that, this disc has several really wonderful pairings.  &quot;I've Got a Crush On You&quot; with Streisand is wonderful, as is &quot;Witchcraft&quot; with Anita Baker.  The songs with Aretha Franklin (&quot;What Now My Love&quot;) and Luther Vandross (The Lady Is A Tramp&quot;) work well for me too.  <br />However, the collaboration on the classic &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; with Gloria Estefan pretty much exemplifies what happened with this album as a concept.  She seemed so awed by doing the same song with such a legend that she was alternatively sounded  either terribly overmatched, or almost shouting over him.    Also, Natalie Cole (who may have started this whole bad idea recording with her late Father Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole), Bono and Kenny G should have been left on the cutting room floor (and perhaps replaced with other tunes by those artists who fared better).<br />No question, this is not Frank's best.  With maybe one exception, his original versions of these songs are better (after all, they are his classics).  But there is some entertainment value here.  Worth purchasing.
B000000ZGO|5.0|If you are wondering how 4 tracks can make up an entire album, then you might not be ready for Hot Buttered Soul.  This isn't relatively short pop song format (like the theme from Shaft); it's extended groove-oriented song-scapes.  &quot;One Woman&quot; is a little weak, but overall it's mood music at its best.
0060920084|2.0|This is a very disappointing book!  The premise is that Bryson, raised in Des Moines and now living in England, comes back to revisit some of the places his father took the family on dreadful summer family vacations. The book has a promising start, with a very amusing description of life in Des Moines and rural Iowa.  But once he hits the road (2 big loops, one through the East and one through the West), it gets pretty dreadful.  Bryson never stays long enough anywhere to get to know anything about the places he visits (a few hours in Williamsburg, a few hours at the Grand Canyon, straight through Jackson Hole without stopping,...).  He seems singularly bad a finding pleasant places to stay or decent places to eat.  Bryson doesn't select high or low points to describe in detail, but seems to give about the same emphasis to almost every place he stays. The good thing about this book is that, if you have short periods in which to read something, it's really easy to put this one down in the middle of a chapter.
B00000JMQC|5.0|Much as I love Judy Garland and her twinkling toes, Return to Oz is far the superior film.  I hate having to write a review as a defense, but Disney's 'sequel' gets so much flak for not being the Wizard of Oz that it needs doing.  More than a sequel, this substantial, satisfying and faithful adaptation of L. Frank Baum's classic children's series eschews the silly, dated song and dance routine for true and masterful storytelling.  This Dorothy lives in both the real world - a gloomy Kansas of broken homes and mental asylums (just what would her Aunty Em do with her after she came home with a bump on her head talking about wizards and witches? hm?) - and the supreme fantasy world - an Oz of broken yellow brick roads, a rotting Emerald City, copper bots, pumpkin men, Mombis and wheelers and goblins oh my!  THIS is the real Oz.  For those parents uncomfortable in letting their children watch this richer, darker, creepier Oz, just let them read the books.  There they will find children-eating beasts, sex-changing children, a whole host of creatures not suitable for younger viewers - and a wonderful world of Oz that will fire their imaginations and prepare them for troubled times.  I thank my lucky stars for having discovered the real Oz at a young and impressionable age, because it not only helped make me a better dreamer, but also better equipped me to deal with a reality of mean kids and rotten schools.  Childhood is hard and kids can be cruel; why is it that when we grow up we forget this and look sweetly upon youth as the perfectly innocent time devoid of baddies and nasties it was not?  Protective parents, do your kids a favor: let them watch this movie (and watch it with them), let them read the books, let them be scared, let them dream, let them live a little.  They'll thank you for it later.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Rarely has a band moved me as much as Radiohead. These guys keep progressing as a band with each album and have put out a load of fine material. OK Computer is Radiohead at their best. It is far different from The Bends as the music is more experimental and darker, but it is just as good, probably better, than The Bends. Thom Yorke's vocals and songwriting shine on tracks like &quot;Lucky&quot; and &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; with their original and sometimes eeire subject matter. The band really shines musically here with the tracks ranging from the beautiful &quot;Let Down&quot;, the epic &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, the amazing &quot;Airbag&quot;, and the driving &quot;Electioneering.&quot; This is one of the best albums I've ever heard in my life. If you are a fan of Radiohead, this is an essential. If your not a fan, still pick this up and become introduced to a great band.
B000001DV2|4.0|There are some really great songs on here to be found, and great talent cannot be covered up (which Def Leppard displays greatly on this album). The production, however, is a whole 'nother story.<br /><br />Upon hearing the percussion on this album, you want to say \\"would you like some drums with that reverb?\\", and the guitars are washed in walls of chorus and \\"pretty boy\\" effects that add unneeded sparkle and twinkle.<br /><br />If this album's production was much more straight forward and in your face, I truly believe that would make all the difference in the world. Rawness is what the latter Lep albums lack, and it's something that I think all fans miss. Who doesn't miss the in-your-face sound of On Through The Night or High N' Dry?<br /><br />I think the band is at fault as well...they were trying to recreate another Hysteria but failed miserably. When you write a hit album, with major success that launches you into fame, one thing you should NEVER do is try to mimic that album on your next release. It will always fail, and is a tried and true procedure. That's when a band should make a drastic turn, and write something that sounds nothing like their previous hit album. This will gain further respect from their fans, because they have \\"grown as a band\\" and have \\"matured musically\\". This is the key to staying on top in the music business. Def Leppard failed to follow this secret and unfortunately, we now have albums like \\"Euphoria\\" and \\"X\\" which is even more obvious that the band has run out of original material and must revert back to their glory days in the late 80s, changing minor details on their hit songs, and re-releasing them under different song titles. \\"Slang\\" was an attempt at changing direction, but by then, it was too late for the band. They had already \\"sold out\\", so to speak.<br /><br />There is hope for this album, however. Heaven Is, Tonight, Stand Up, Personal Property, Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad, and I Wanna Touch U are all great songs musically and lyrically. Stand Up (Kick Love into Motion) is probably one of the greatest songs ever written in the 1990s, and it never ceases to amaze me that this song did not climb higher than all of their other famed hits from Adrenalize.<br /><br />If you already own the other Lep albums, go ahead and buy this to complete your collection; but if you're looking for one solid Lep album, let me suggest On Through The Night, High N' Dry, or Pyromania. That infamous Lep magic was lost a long time ago, and the remnants were left behind on those releases.p (Kick Love into Motion) is probably one of the greatest songs ever written in the 1990s, and it never ceases to amaze me that this song did not climb higher than all of their other famed hits from Adrenalize.

630575067X|2.0|If it wasn't for the amazing special effects, The Phantom Menace would have crashed and burned. But even the special effects are wasted on a weak plot and some mediocre acting (mainly the kid who plays Anakin Skywalker). The pod race scene was nice as well as the underwater world, but overall, something just seems to be missing. The movie doesn't really go anywhere in the end. The other Star Wars films were much more focused and exciting. The Phantom Menace was good on the big screen, but after watching it on video, I grew sick of the film immediately. The film is average and if you didn't see it in the theater, then don't bother with the video.
B000001FKY|5.0|This could be Lep's best album. This cd has such outstanding songs such as Rocket, Animal, Pour Some Sugar On Me, Armageddon It, Love Bites, much much more. I dont know how this became a 4.5 album, because it REALLY should be a 5. Excellent cd. Over half of the album is nothing but hits. All of the above are hits, plus more on this album. Any rock fan should already have this in their collection, but if not, click the ADD TO SHOPPING CART button RIGHT NOW! Sensational album...YOU HAVE TO GET IT!
6304578458|5.0|Grosse Pointe Blank lived up to my expectations. It's very funny and witty, and it avoids running into cliches and slow points. John Cusak is great as a hit-man, Martin, going through sort of a &quot;mid-life crisis&quot; although he hasn't even hit his thirties yet. He ends up going back home to do his final job when he meets up with the girl (Minnie Driver) he stood up on prom night and ends up going to his ten-year high school reunion. During his visit, Martin is threatened by rivals and must watch his back to make it out of Grosse Pointe alive. Plot twists and turns come about and it's hard to predict what happens next. Dan Aykyrod delivers a nice performance as Martin's rival. If you enjoy sharp wit and somewhat dark humor, see this movie. Oh yeah, the soundtrack (The Clash, Violent Femmes, The English Beat, The Cure, David Bowie &amp; Queen, etc.) is nice too.
B000001E21|4.0|I didnt know that these were b-sides until later. This is a good collection, and any Lep fan should already have it in their collection. Great songs on this album include Fractured Love, Action, Miss You In A Heartbeat, Ring Of Fire, and others. This album will rock the pants off you. Take my advice and get this album.
B000002NJS|4.0|Ray of Light is one of Madonna's best albums.  It is what Madonna does best: re-invent herself.  This time around, Madonna takes on electronica, but as always adds her own twist on the sound.  The title track and the haunting and beautiful *Frozen* are probably the best songs on the album.  I also think *Power of Good-bye* is a simple, yet lovely song about love gone wrong.  The first track is also good.  Pick this one up - it's a keeper.
B00004XOWM|1.0|This has to be one of the worst wast of CD packaging material since, why, wouldn't you know it, &quot;Significant Other&quot;.  The big Limp Bizkit's musical carreer ended with the last song on &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Ya'll&quot;, when they got popular.  I hate popular bands, because it seems to me they all sell out.  Is that true here? There's only one possible answer, and it isn't no.<br />To see his ignorance personified, take the song where he makes fun of Trent Reznor.  Even if you don't like his music, I think you half to appreciate him for his musical genius (I don't like rap but I think Dr.Dre is a smart guy).  He says f--k about 46 plus times in the song, and at one point, tells you!  Here's a lyrical quote: &quot;If I say f--k, 2 more times/That's 46 f--k's in this f--ked up rhyme&quot;.  Yes, Fred, f--ked up indeed.  Just like your head, and your band.<br />There is no reason at ALL to buy this album.  You can hear the same thing buy putting a guitar riff on a record, and loop it.  I don't think people who listen to this music are ignorant, but I think people who beleive that this type of music is art, are.
B000031XCR|3.0|Well, here it is:  Celine Dion's greatest hits album.  Even though I'm not a big fan, I picked it up anyway because she does have a captivating voice.  Since then, the CD has pretty much become a dust collecter.  Nothing about the album was really outstanding.  The only songs I really like are *The Power of Love* and *To Love you More.*  All in all, it's disappointing.  Her only great album is her Christmas one.
0780631684|5.0|This movie was a delightful variation from the horror movie crap that Hollywood has been hammering out in recent years.<br />The relatively untouched actors give the film a feeling that mainstream movie stars couldn't.<br />While a touch on the gory side, it does get its point across.<br />Final Verdict:  Don't miss.
B00000AFDW|3.0|If Kiss really wanted to obey their fans wishes, then why didn't Peter and Ace appear on the whole album. It's not like the material on here is so complex that they couldn't handle it. The fans really wanted a new album from the original four. But half the fans guessed what would happen, and they were right. But lets go through the tracks.1. Psycho Circus- I really like this song, a lot. Awesome opener. Very true to the Kiss style of fun rock songs.2. Within- My favorite track on the album. Being a fan of the revious Kiss lineup, this is very reminiscent of Revenge or Carnival of Souls. Very dark and heavy.3. I Pledge Alleigence- Another good and fun rocker from Stanley. Thank God the lyrics are not over the top cheese. Once again, a true Kiss rock song.4. Into the Void- This one comes from my favorite Kiss member. Ace could always write cool songs, and this is another one. New ground really is not explored, but it's Ace, what more do you want.5. We Are One-O.K. This is where we start going downhill. I'm sorry, is this Kiss or Hootie and the Blowfish. This song should not have made it to the final cut. They should have used another Ace or one of the Peter songs. Oh yeah, they voted Peter's songs out. Instead, we have &quot;We are One&quot;. Ugh!6. You Wanted the Best- Yeah I did, but I got this instead. One star gets deleted just because of the fact that they wrote a song called You Wanted the Best, You got the Best. CHEESE. I will say that the lyrics are not as bad as they could have been, and the tune itself is decent, but still, look at the title.(hanging my head in disbelief).7. Raise Your Glasses- This one is another song that should not have been here. It's not horrible, but it has no edge to it. Something else should have been here.8. I Finally Found My Way- Paul wrote it, and Peter sang it. It would have ben better if Peter had a rockin song to sing. In my opinion, this song could have been better. 9. Dreamin- Not only is this a ripoff of &quot;I'm Eighteen&quot; they also ripoff &quot;I Want You&quot; at the end. This isn't the first time Kiss has ripped themselves off. Revenge contains riffs from The Elder and Unmasked. This song is very mediocre. Could have been replaced.10. Journey of 1,000 Years- Is this a good song. Yes!. Should it have been on the new Kiss album with the original members. No! I love this song, but Gene is the demon again, where did that demon spirit go. I guess it's gone.I find it interesting that Peter only played on one song. Into The Void. I'm not sure if Frehley played on the whole thing, I read where he said he did not. I believe him. This album sounds a little to mixed up. It is not a complete Kiss album, sounds like someones idea of what a Kiss album should be. Very disappointing.
6305205620|5.0|I am a metallica fan, and a recent DVD owner, so when i saw this DVD i had to have it. It is the best DVD i own. The picture is perfect, and the sound is as good as any CD. The in between parts where Hetfield talks to the audience are pretty funny too. An absolute must if you are a fan.
B000002J1O|5.0|This CD is the apex effort from prog-rock icons Genesis. Overshadowed by the classic 'The Lamb lies down..', I feel that this is a stronger overall effort by the band - they all have a chance to show their talents in individual 'mini-classics' that abound this CD.  Gabriel is awesome as usual, however all the other members contribute to make a very well constructed masterpiece that this is.<br />This was Genesis at their 70's best - forget what you have heard in the Collins-era stuff - this is true art/prog/rock in it's finest form!
B000001ELR|5.0|I Love This CD. It is so cool. I Love It Loud, War Machine, Danger, Rock N Roll Hell and the amazing title track rock! This CD is always with me. This is truly essential and is not to be missed. It is their best since Love Gun. Nothing can compare with the heavy rock sound on this album. By the way, Eric Carr's drumming on this album is so heart-pounding he buries Peter Criss. Buy this, you won't regret it.<br />R.I.P. Eric Carr...
0875847706|5.0|Read it from cover to cover in one sitting. Have read reviews by other customers as well before I started this.  I was living in San Francisco at the time of Werner Ehrhart and EST...but that was 25 years ago and having not attended a seminar with all my other pals (I hated the idea of not being able to take an aspirin if I needed it...a HUGE reason for not partaking), I felt that I was getting a lot of new stuff. Self-help is only good when the authors tell you how to do it.  They not only told me how to achieve what they felt was needed, but the did it in a way that I could understand.  The finest thing about the book was that I have been doing this all along for years as I fight chronic illness, try to raise children, keep the grandchildren in line, work in a business with my husband of 43 years and melt professional and personal lives together effectively (while cleaning my oven, giving birth and raising chickens....walking to school barefoot through the snow....you know the scenario).  It was just so good to see things that I thought ( as a result of an excellent therapist and as a musician) were inventions of my own were actually thought out by two such amazing people.  To be validated like that was awesome. How the ideas were presented were sparkling new.  How the authors used their own ideas in their own lives and the lives of those who are lucky enough to be a part of their day to day experience was so inspiring that all of the ideas became new and bright and polished and fragrant and all those wonderful things that ideas should be whether they are already thought of or not.
B00003CX8J|5.0|A wonderful movie that translated the comic book well to the big screen.  Doing what no other comic book themed movie has been able to do, these characters actually came across as &quot;real&quot;.  With the exception of Halle Berry as Storm (Angela Bassett would have been much better), each actor played their character perfect.  Hugh Jackman will make you believe there is a Wolverine.  Halle Berry, as usual, is good for looking at but not acting.  Capt. Picard, I mean Patrick Stewart, is great as always.  Don't let the fact that it's a comic book adaptation turn you off from seeing this movie.  It'll definitely be your loss.
B00004XOWM|3.0|There is no doubt that this album will have heads banging all over America and from what I have seen, the UK. The band have selected to smash out a heavier more metal sound on many of these tracks, ie. full nelson, hot dog and rollin' (air raid vehicle). Any Bizkit fan will love these.   They have also put in there mellow but heavy bass tracks, ie. livin' it up, my way, and the one.   However, the lyrics to these tracks stay typically Limp, rapping and singing about how damn f'ing good they are at partying and rockin'.  Now i am not against this but maybe a change in lyrics might be nice.    But my main complaint of this album is there move into DR. Dre type rap, not what Bizkit are about at all, no better example than 'getcha groove on', which is very cheesy and typical.  Almost gangster rap.<br />My main worry about Bizkit is their future.  It is plainly obvious that they are goin' to sell out.  I bought this album in a supermarket alongside the new Spice Girls CD.  Not what i would expect.  BIZKIT, FOR THE REAL FANS, PLEASE DON'T SELL OUT.

B000001DTM|5.0|Contrary to popular belief, pop music's high-point of the 90s did not come when grunge ruled the airwaves. It came when U2 released Achtung Baby. This album is filled with moods and colors that not only change the atmosphere of the room, but turn it on its head.<br />The album's opening track &quot;Zoo Station,&quot; is like a subway ride through a sleezy underworld, which is only lit by a glimmer of hope. When Bono croones &quot;Time is a train/ makes the future the past/ leaves you standing in the station/ your face pressed up against the glass,&quot; you can feel U2 taking their success from the 80s, and morphing it into the complex and confusing world of the 90s. Other tracks, such as &quot;Until the End of the World,&quot; &quot;The Fly,&quot; and &quot;So Cruel,&quot; are surprising in their despair. This is the same band whose optimism dominated the charts in the 80s? Nonetheless, these songs are captivating, and leave the listener haunted and yet thrilled by the darkness we're all capable of.<br />But Achtung Baby is not all darkness. &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; is sensual and spiritual. &quot;Trying to Throw Your Arms Around the World&quot; is full of hope and joy, while &quot;Ultraviolet&quot; embraces the pain of love, and ends up in a spritual place where light and guidance is all that matters.<br />The lyrics of this album are like a thickly layered Yeats poem, that is always moving and changing as it is spoken. &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; is a moving confessional of Judas, with Jesus himself on the other side of the booth. &quot;The Fly&quot; is a phone call from hell, in which the sinner almost embraces and enjoys their lechery. And then there is the highpoint of the album (and possibly U2's career): the classic &quot;One.&quot; So universal in its scope, &quot;One&quot; is about the struggles of a relationship, the trials of surviving AIDS, the difficulty in being yourself, the possibility of unity and peace, all wrapped up into one song.The story goes that U2 was on the verge of breaking up when they started to record this album. Frustrated with reconciling their musical differences, the band embraced the sudden emergence of this song. In the long run, &quot;One&quot; may have saved the band from splitting apart. &quot;One&quot; and Achtung Baby are a grand statement on the complexity of being human. Thank God someone was able to put it into words and set it to music; one listen and everything in the world seems to make sense.

0060976624|4.0|Public relations is a fascinating business, and when Christopher Buckley approaches it in his novel Thank You For Smoking, he makes you realize the great lengths some industries go to sell themselves, as well as the short lengths we consumers go to challenge the images they create.<br />Nick Naylor, the protagonist of this satire, is at times so suave and witty as a character, that you almost end up believing the lies he's telling. He's working for the Tobacco companies, and waging a one man assault on the public opinion that smoking is dangerous. Along the way he goes from a white-collar jerk whose lack of success is about to cost him his job, to the James Bond of PR. While appearing on the Oprah Winfrey show, he suddenly turns into a master of dodging the issues and turning them against his attackers. His ability to use the English language as a weapon against the very people who are costing him his job, is in itself the book's hilarious highpoint. The whirlwind of twisted words forced me to realize all the ludicrous ways in which politicians and corporate big wigs shine a positive light on the garbage they're doing. This book could have easily been about Gore and Bush running their infomercial-style campaigns. It could have easily been about Firestone and Ford acting like they never knew their products were prone to exploding. In the business of lying to the general public, Nick Naylor becomes a master, and sadly the reading audience falls in love with him!<br />The strength of Buckley's book comes in it's humorous style and thought-provoking subject. The covert meetings of the &quot;MOD Squad,&quot; (in which PR reps from the gun-lobby and alcohol industry hold private lunches to complain about their uphill battles to, in essence, sell death)are absolutely brilliant. I found myself laughing almost every other page, at either some description or just the ridiculousness of a situation. These were the moments that kept me turning the pages.<br />However, in the end, the espionage/thriller plot line wasn't all that exciting. One plot twist in particular towards the end of the book, felt like a lame cop-out to pull the narrative towards a resolution. But even then, Buckley's style and mastery of satire kept me engaged and willing to root for the smug protagonist, whose intensions were anything but good.
0812504488|5.0|This macabre tale--inspired by a dream--starts slowly but with an ever increasing sense of mystery, culminates in a vortex of horror worthy of Poe.  What evil could be more impossible to resist or to conquer than Man's inherent flaw of dualtiy?  RLS describes it as the innate struggle bewteen angelic and demonic forces which lurk in every soul.  Beneath the veneer of Cilivization the two extremes wage eternal war in one breast. <br />  Mr. Utterson, a conscientious laywer in Victorian London and longtime friend of both Henry Jekyll and Dr. Lanyon, confides his misgivings about the former's will to his cousin, Mr. Enfield.  During the course of the chilling novella, each of the gentlemen contributes to our knowledge of this morbidly fascinating central character, who gradually loses control of his reason or his will.  <br /> What has caused the respectable Dr. Jekyll to condone such bizarre behavior from his guest/protege/parasitecalled Mr. Hyde? Why does he endure the odious presence of a younger, shorter, vicious person--even to entrusting him with the key to his residence?  This Edward Hyde emotes something bestial and unrestrained, which inspires instant fear or disgust in normal men.  Quick to flair up in unprovoked anger and shocking brutality, this Hyde creature is proving a menace to society.  Naturally the concerned lawyer becomes increasingly alarmed at this unexplained hold over Henry Jekyll, but can a few learned gentlemen protect him from himself or his rash devotion to a human monster?  By uniting forces, can they preserve both his property, his reputation and ultimately, his life?  <br />  When an elderly MP is murdered on the street, even Jekyll seems to realize that things have gone too far, but can the now drug-dependent physician control his urge to throw off the shackles of Society?  Is he himself a victim...of the arrogance of medical and scientific knowledge or of attempting to play the god of creation with unknown powers?  Hollywood has offeredus various excellent, chllling versions, but the Classical Faithful will want to consult the original--which is more subtle and therefore more horrible than simply presenting the tale from the viewpoint of the protagonist. The last chapter consists of Jekyll's gripping confession: how a once learned and noble man realized the only way to destroy his diabolical alter-ego...Can he yet be saved by his loyal friends? Or must he face his destiny completely alone? Beware the beast that lurks within!
B0000021RB|5.0|Its so hard to believe that when these guys recorded this album they were virtually an almost unknown/misfit club band who once summed up their sound as &quot;the Beatles with Horns&quot; - - This album however in my opinion is one of the most significant albums in the history of Rock not only artistically but in terms of the groundbreaking influence it would have on American music for years to come.  While &quot;they'd only just begun&quot; (pardon the pun), they succeeded in laying out their forumula, setting their identity, and making magic the first time around.  Listen to music before this recording, listen to it after...  and you realize just what this album was and meant.  After this, I don't think don't think their albums necessarily got better - - they just got more polished.  The energy maintained throughout this recording is amazing.  The lyrics and messages are deep... the solos, interaction of the members and arrangements must have been a punch in the face to people who heard it the first time.  Fans of &quot;Chicago&quot; the '80s pop band may not appreciate this album, but I'd sure a whole generation of even Jazz heads like me have never forgotten it and never will ! ! !
B00000JNOJ|5.0|muddy cuts straight to the chase &quot; Well my home is in the delta......&quot; what more could you want ?? muddy ,buddy guy, willie dixon ,the most amazing production you will ever hear on a recording ,this is the reason we listen to the blues!Raw emotion mixed wih the poetry of the blues killer licks of Mr Guy , etc etc  the back photo of the cd says it all, your life will be better for owning this cd .
B000002KIE|5.0|I'd like to start out by addressing Bill Felps, who claimed that the Pistols were purely about image and suggested everyone pick up a Ramones record instead.  Well, I have nothing against the Ramones...but if any punk band of the mid to late '70s was purely about image, they were it.  No politics, no revolution...just four guys who dressed identically and played three-chord ditties like \\"Sheena Is A Punk Rocker\\"...I fail to see what's so \\"revolutionary\\" about that.  When a new member replaced an old one, he assimilated by changing his last name (at least, for all intents and purposes) to Ramone...making him a PART of something, as opposed to an individual.  When one looks at the original line-up of the Sex Pistols (before Sid stepped in and tried to out-Rotten John Lydon), one sees a group of four young men who were VASTLY different...not only in appearance, but also in upbringing, values, and influences.  Ever stop to ask yourself why the band split in a flare of animosity a mere eighteen months after its big break?  It was because its members were almost entirely incompatible.  This was a band that was about image?  As opposed to the \\"revolutionary\\" Ramones, who were still recycling Beach Boys riffs?  The Pistols were about many things...image being the last.  First and foremost, they were about angst, disatisfaction, anger, chaos, and SOCIAL CHANGE.  If those qualities don't define revolutionary, then you think of a better definition.  The Sex Pistols did not INVENT punk rock...no one invented it.  It was just TIME FOR A CHANGE, and punk rock manifested itself out of the need for something fresh in a fatally stagnant musical era.  But the Sex Pistols must surely be remembered for being outrageous enough and unsettling enough to put punk rock on the proverbial map by angering and intimidating authority figures the world over.  And they did it in less than two years with only ONE studio album...and this is it.  Changing the world with one piece of vinyl...how can that be wrong?
B000002H6C|2.0|Too repetitive and most of the melodies are uninteresting, the counter melodies of the prior two albums are nowhere to be found in this work.  I guess those were the contribution of their bassist who died before this album was made.  This album is better than any of Metallica's albums that came after it, but that's as positive as I can be about it.  The beginning of the end.  At least they're selling more product now. Ultimately, all you need from Metallica are 'Ride the Lightning' and 'Master of Puppets'.
B000002IJL|5.0|These are ten of the best songs from one of the best decades in American history. The 50's were a time of promise, but more importantly, a celebration of youth. Some of the cuts are just pointless rock classics only good for blasting in your droptop on the expressway. But Ben E. King's Stand By Me never fails to bring a tear to my eye. Anyone who doesn't feel moved by this track must have a coffin and a tombstone because they're already dead. Bottom Line: this CD is a must buy. If you don't have it you should take a long look in the mirror and ponder your existence
B00004XOWM|5.0|First and foremost, I would like to say that I do not usually listen to this type of music.  I am a huge Stone Temple Pilots fan, along with Green Day and Incubus.  But, I have also been a big Limp Bizkit fan for awhile.  This shows that you don't have to just listen to Korn and Papa Roach to like Limp.  This album, by far, is the most diverse and innovative yet.  Much of their older roots are shown, but they also show some new, different styles.  I highly recommend that you go out and buy this album.
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|This movie was funny the first time you watch it.  But after that don't waste your time.  This movie has no replay value and to me that makes this a pretty damn bad movie.
B00001NFCY|4.0|Creed avoids the sophomore jinx with another strong release in Human Clay.  Once again nothing real special on the music end, very solid and sound, however, it's the powerful lyrics again that provides the fuel for this engine.  <br />I have heard rumblings that Human Clay is Creeds sell out album; however, I don't detect much difference from this album than My Own Prison. The albums contain the same style of music, same guitar riffs, same strong poetic pros for lyrics.  The fact is my only complaint about the album is that creed really didn't seem to try and go out on a limb with a song or two and try something different musically. The major difference in this album would be some of the lyrics are more of an upbeat nature and mood, which would vary from their first album.  When you write in poetry or prose style you have to remember the writer is not always depressed, upset or angry, sometimes what is written can be upbeat and uplifting.   With a newborn baby, my guess would be that in several songs on this album this would be the case, especially in \\"Arms wide open.\\"<br />Overall I felt this Album was another strong release by Creed.  I enjoyed the lyrics and would definitely recommend it to anybody who enjoyed the first album.
B00003Q43A|1.0|One star?  Even that is more praise than it deserves. I'll ignore the huge gaping holes in the plot, trite cliches, stereotyping and general stupidity that runs through the film to talk about characterisation.  Or, more accurately, the complete lack of it. It would seem that actual acting ability was redundant in this film, and all that was necessary to make it onto the cast list was to have appeared in a previous blockbuster. Will Smith's previous film was 'bad boys', in which he plays a wise-cracking maverick cop.  Here, he is a wise-cracking maverick pilot. Bill Pullman is probably best known for being Meg Ryan's dull, dependable fiance in 'sleepless in seattle'.  guess he'll make a good president then. Jeff Goldblum was a scientist in 'jurassic park', so no surprises here then. (Granted he is actually a chaos mathematician, but hey, that's sort of a scientist, right?) Harvey Fierstien is camp and gay, so no real characterisation is required here then. Brett Spiner plays data in Star Trek.  okay, let's have him dishevelled, but basically the same. Randy Quaid?  Well, he's a bit unstable, so that'll have to do.<br />Have I missed out on any real character developments?  Don't think so.  Now, if all of this &quot;short-hand characterisation&quot; was so that they could really try and strech our imaginations, great.  Unfortunately, it doesn't even try.  I will confess to being almost impressed in the first half hour, with the actual arrival of the alien ships, visually it was impressive.  There were a few deft touches (the ship hovering over Los Angeles, and the widescale panic that ensued, the initial attempts to contact the aliens via 'close encounters...' style music.) and, after all, any film that blows up the white house can't be all bad. It is really just another summer blockbuster.  Let's be honest, they never amount to much anyway. The only positive thing I can think of with regards to this is that the dvd appears to be well appointed.  Hopefully this is a continuing trend.
B00004XONN|4.0|I'm writing this review for people who are fairly unfamiliar to Radiohead, as I was.  I bought this CD about a week after it came out, after hearing all the hype, and then the many good reviews.  At the very first listen, it was strange, but I kept listening like many have recommended, and it didn't take long to realize the fabulousness of this album.  Each song has uniquely different aspects to it, so it is nearly impossible to catergorize the whole album with a &quot;sound&quot;.  For example, &quot;treefingers&quot; is very mellow sounding, almost meditative, while &quot;Idioteque&quot; has a very stacatto, almost stressed out feel to it.  Alltogether these different aspects combine to make a great album.  You do not need to be a Radiohead fan to buy this album, you just need to have an open mind and will to listen and let to music come to you.  For example, at first I hated &quot;The national anthem&quot; with its collapsing brass movement at the end.  But it has since grown on me.  A word to the wise - like a lot of other music, this cd is great while listened to on headphones.<br />p.s. i wanted to give this album 4 1/2 stars...but couldn't...
B00003CWTI|5.0|Magnolia is easily and without a doubt one of the most original, interesting, and insightful films I have ever been fortunate enough to have seen. The intricate and well-acted plot spellbinds viewers; they watch with eager awe as they are led through a twisting and turning passage, and step by step approach the truth. This truth is that it is human nature to hurt and be hurt, to need and be needed, and is expertly illustrated through a spiral of everyday-but-compelling events intertwining the lives of the film's variety of characters.
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger was an extremely thought provoking book, and it applies to every society at any time, thus is as powerful today in America as it was in France 50 years ago. Basically the book is about a man in Algiers who is killed by his society for his social abnormalities. He commited murder, but was executed for not crying at his mother's funeral. To me this book was a painful reflection of the mold that societies try to force people into, and the way the society views people who don't fit the mold. I felt this book was extremely powerful because of how it shows the cruelty that society can inflict to people who don't fit in.
0553277472|1.0|This is a layman's, cop-out guide to philosophy... what a joke.  Want a nice, abridged history of a beautiful subject, read this, I guess....  But how can you sum up 2000 years of thought in a few hundred pages?  Classic America... take the low road, read as little as possible, take the easy way out... whatever is easier...  I think things like this in like are rediculous...  <br />I kept waiting for it to go deep, I mean really deep.  It never did.
B00004TA41|5.0|This record made me physically tired.  I was out of breath by the end.  If you can listen to the whole thing without screaming out in amazement then you are a rare individual.  This is as good as anything Trane has ever done.  A must have.
B00003CX95|5.0|There is only one thing missing on this DVD. That is the outtakes. No Mel Gibson movie from Hamlet to Lethal Weapon to (well) Braveheart should be without a hillarious outtakes section. Mel Gibson is not only a fantastic actor and director, but a legendary practical joker. I was lucky enough to see the outtakes of this movie on TV and they are riotous!<br />Notice that I avoid the word &quot;bloopers&quot; as, to the best of my knowledge, none of these outtakes contain groin injuries.
0553106635|5.0|Wow, I don't know what can be said that could do this book, or this series justice.  I can say this is the best fantasy series ever written, and this is the best book within the series.  I strongly recommend A Song of Ice and Fire. The book to start with is A Game of Thrones.  Once you read that there is no doubt in my mind you'll pick up the rest of the books.  Enjoy
B00000064G|5.0|My first impression of this album was pretty music, but not all that much more. After my second, I found myself thinking this is very pretty music, and more. And after my third I found myself compulsively listening to this album for months. Beyond Nick Drakes importance as an influence on many of the greatest bands and musicians playing today, Pink Moon is simply one of those albums that any self respecting music fan must own. I do not make this recommendation without a warning though. Pink Moon has the emotional density of only the greatest albums (Coltrane's A Love Supreme for instance), and listening to it will rout your emotional state to match that of the album. This is the power of music at its greatest potency.
B00004XQP4|3.0|if u like 'Dookie' then don't buy this cd. This is a pop song. and it is not great. just a few song is ok.
B00003CXE7|3.0|Probably another of Ridley Scott's tributes to kubrick, certainly does not compare to spartacus - again like most films nowadays too much technology and too little attention to the screenplay. The cinematography and Scott's direction carry the film. The fact that Russell Crowe was voted sexiest actor is another sign of the times. Overall, another addition to the line of movies that entertain and not much more.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Hey everybody, lets get a hit album and not do anything new andinnovative and stay in the same pile of ....  $3 Bill was a great CD, but Limp's records have gone downhill since then.  Why's Durst so off anyways? His parents had a pool.  Anyways, Durst's &quot;lyrics&quot; are more like he's trying to get slogans and not say anything important at all.  I  will give the band credit because they rock, but they need to lose the dead weight of Durst to get a credible lead singer or maybe even an MC with real skills.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Though I have never heard Three Dollar Bill Y'all,  I have heard Significant Other many times.  I think that Significant Other is one of the best albums ever made with every song being great.  Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water is also a very good album, but the bad part is that there are a few songs that aren't great.  I still reccomend this album.

B000002H33|5.0|This album is a masterpiece for any music lover. I personally am not a big metal fan but I like any kind of music that is Powerful, and heartfelt that is why is strange as it seems my cd collection which includes CDs from Pat Metheny, John Mclaughlin, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Beethoven, Master of Puppets and Ride the lighting are part of my top ten favorites.
0446608955|5.0|It's been a long time since a book has made me cry.  I purchased this book at the Phoenix Airport and was finished by the time I landed in Detroit.  I had to keep closing the book and fanning my eyes because it was so emotional.  I didn't want the other passangers to see me crying.  This is the first book I have read by Sparks but I plan to buy them all!
0792841344|5.0|The extras on this DVD are killer!  The commentary by director Don Coscarelli and actors Michael Baldwin, Reggie Bannister, and Bill Thornbury, and Angus Scrimm was entertaining, and gave me an insight on what went on during the filming.<br />My only complaint about the commentary was that the parts with Angus seemed dubbed in, as if he wasn't there with the others.  After awhile, I didn't notice anymore, as I was enthralled with what they were discussing, it really delved into what Don Coscarelli vision for the whole film was.  They also went into all the actual locations the film was shot at, which was a real treat for me as a fan of this horror series.<br />It features the original Theatrical trailers, and TV spots, which used to give me the shivers when I was a child. What was also a great addition was deleted scenes and behind the scenes footage shot by a crew member who brought a home movie camera on the set.<br />The gallery of international promo materials such as lobby cards and newspaper ads were great.  Angus Scrimm and a very young Don Coscarelli are featured in a 1979 interview which was lots of fun.  Another rarity on the dvd was a UK disco version of the Phantasm theme, too much!<br />I used my computer's DVD player (compaq presario pentium III) to view it, and I was concerned with all the extra features it'd freeze up on me, but it didn't.  This is a top notch DVD all the way.<br />I'm thrilled to death I got it!
B000005ALN|5.0|I purchased this cd four years ago and have thoroughly enjoyed it since.  I was never a big fan of George Michael or Wham, but this cd is really good.  It is superior to anything he did prior to this.  It's not the pop style he did before.  Rather, it is a more mature George, with more sophistocated tunes.  I once heard radio d.j's criticizing this cd, and I think they were just letting their ego get in the way.  I think they felt they were gaining points with their listening audience.  I saw right through it.  This cd is packed with tracks that have great arrangements, some of which are emotionally compelling.  My favorite is the title track, &quot;Older&quot;.
B00003CX7L|5.0|Toy Story 2 is one of those sequels that take the success and beauty from the original picture and create something more. Pixar and Disney created a film that is more entertaining and more philosophical than its predecessor. It maintains the light-hearted, easy atmosphere from Toy Story and A Bug's Life, but this time with a plot that comes more from the toy's point-of-view along with some of the most original humor ever thought up for an animated picture. It's a satisfying trip all the way.<br />It picks up where Toy Story left off: Woody and Buzz made up and everyone's all good. Then, by accident, Woody ends up in the home of a greedy toy collector (voiced by, of course, Wayne Knight). So what's the objective now? Buzz leads Hamm, Rex, Mr. Potatohead, and Slinky on a mission to save Woody, a mission that will make you cheer and laugh. Toy Story 2 also explores the history of Woody himself, something we never really thought about in the first picture. The rest is up to you to see, because once you've seen it, you'd want to recommend it to friends too.<br />The first Toy Story was amazing. Toy Story 2 built upon that, reassuring that Pixar and the filmmakers are the real thing. Toy Story 2 managed to outgross Princess Mononoke, a film I give credit to since it was Hayao Miyazaki films the Disney animators turned to whenever they needed inspiration. This movie is for everyone. It's delightful and a lot of fun. Pixar and Disney are really going infinity...and beyond.
B000002BE9|5.0|Tidal, hit's you like a tide, it grabs you and keeps you coming back for more. Here we have the beautiful Fiona Apple's debut LP, and it is an engaging CD. All the songs keep you interested and Fiona's voice is something to marvel over. Some of my favorite tracks off of &quot;Tidal&quot; are, &quot;Sleep To Dream&quot;, &quot;Criminal&quot;, &quot;Never Is A Promise&quot;, &quot;The First Taste&quot; and &quot;Shadowboxer&quot;. To be perfectly honest here, I love them all. They are all very neat, thought-provoking, mellow tracks. To describe this album in words, just wouldn't do it justice. You have to hear it to believe, it is worth every penny and a must have CD in any collection. Later, Fiona followed this album up with the musically brilliant &quot;When The Pawn....&quot;, though buy them both because they are both unique. This CD simply, will take you to another place and will change your outlook on some things in life. Powerful, emotional, with great musical work (Fiona is excellent at playing the piano), Tidal, if you open your mind a little, will grab you like a tide.
B00004XONN|1.0|I was ready to truly love this CD. I love so much Bends and OK . This is so pretentious is disgusting. They forgot the golden rules of great rock music! Experiment with sounds, Instrument, arrangement not with melodies! There is nothing on here that has been done before and much better by artist like Bowie, Eno  or any German avant-garde bands from the seventies.
0671042858|5.0|I thought this book represented a departure from standard Stephen King fare. I loved it. I thought that Tricia sorely pressed by her predicament had to make a choice between two visions of God, The Subaudible God of her father, a kind of deist interpretation of God. God as the clockmaker who made the world then left it behind, but maybe watches in a passive or disinterersted fashion. Or the God of Tom Gordon who cares and even intervenes - but only if you earn the &quot;save&quot; through your own courage and efforts. In the end Tricia chooses Tom Gordon's God and earns his support. When her parents visit in the hospital, the one thing she tries to communicate to her family (most importantly  dad) is that she earned the &quot;save&quot;. I think because she also hopes dad can be saved as well.
0780631684|3.0|From Glen Morgan and James Wong, alumni of TV's &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;Space: Above And Beyond,&quot; we, the audience, get an entertaining flick that comes as close to a thrill ride as Hollywood can offer as of late.<br />Alex Browning, played by Devon Sawa who was in the 1999 teen flick &quot;Idle Hands,&quot; foresees the tragic crash of the plane that he and his fellow classmates are on; he and six others make it off the plane before his premonition becomes reality. Now, having cheated death and that which was meant to happen, the seven survivors are left to be stalked by the menacing powers of fate. They only have so much time to figure out the pattern that death has set before them and how to prevent the powers that be from deciding their ultimate fate.<br />I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't anything too involved and nothing you really had to think too hard about, and that's exactly what I was looking for. It presented an interesting idea of escaping the path that is set before us and taking control of the things that are often beyond our grasp, if but for a mere instant.<br />The entire movie looked and felt like an episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; and that probably added to some of my enjoyment. If that's your thing, I think you'll really like it. And if you're looking for something other than the cheesy horror flicks that Hollywood continues to vomit at us, then try &quot;Final Destination&quot; for a change.
B000007PI9|5.0|This modern classic is like a fine wine, meant to be slowly savored. This is the thinking man's action movie. Most of the subtletiesare lost on the unwashed masses who are incapable of appreciating true culture. Kubrick, Bergman, Cosmatos. Yes, Cosmatos is an equal or better than Kubrick or Bergman and if you don't agree we can fight over it down at the Wal-Mart parking lot. If you like this film, I also recommend another cinema gem, 'Any Which Way But Loose'. Onward and upward with the arts.
B00003CX5A|1.0|Okay, this is my second attempt to comment on this movie. So here goes. This movie really captures the true talent of Johnny Depp. Johnny Who? You know, the guy who can't act and makes lousy movies. But the makers of this yawn-a-thon went one step further and put a munching in as leading lady. So what do you have? Dorky-looking guy and spooky-looking girly (who's idea was it to dye that mop?). <br />This movie was dull almost from the beginning. And as with many recent Hollywood movies, when you don't have a decent script, throw in special effects. But even decent special effects can't save this thing. <br />Now you might be thinking, &quot;Hey, this is a movie for kids.&quot; Hmmm, I thought so too, but I played it for an 8-year-old, and a bit into the movie she's asking me if there's anything on TV. <br />But the scariest part in this movie isn't the Headless Horseman. It's wondering what kind of arrangement these two &quot;actors&quot; made with Satan in order to get paid the money they do to star in this highly flushable movie.<br />But there is something positive to say about this movie: I managed to get a good nap. It was like taking a sedative. I was in and out of this thing, so I couldn't really tell you how the entire story was going. Last thing I remember, Chris Walken was growing his head...then I was totally asleep.<br />So go ahead and buy this thing. Heck, give one to a friend. Anybody you know who's having trouble sleeping.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead reminds me of Pink Floyd in reverse.  Floyd started out with purely experimental stuff, like Umma Gumma and Atom Heart Mother, then got more conventional (but continued to produce quality work) with Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall.  With Radiohead, we have seen their more conventional material in the early phase of their career with Pablo Honey and The Bends, followed by a glimpse into their musical curiosity with OK Computer (especially in the title track), and now we see a band assaulting musical sensibilities without apologies.  Kid A is impressive in its confidence and in the sheer artistry and (can I say it here?) &quot;cajones&quot; needed to produce such a work.<br />As I claimed in the title to my review, I get it.  I think.  Pablo Honey was about human angst in a sense we all can understand.  &quot;Creep&quot; and &quot;Thinking About You&quot; are odes for every ineffectual Romeo out there, and &quot;Everyone Can Play Guitar&quot; is all about every wannabe's yearning to be a rock star.  Normal stuff.  The Bends goes deeper into neurosis, especially in &quot;Fade Out,&quot; which talks about rows of houses crowding the song's protagonist.  OK Computer explores the onslaught of technology and its infringement on everyday life.  Radiohead has gone from talking about one man, one creep who can't talk to a girl, to a whole race of people who &quot;Lock up their spirits, drill holes in themselves...&quot;<br />Now, with Kid A, Radiohead presents its Everyman protagonist once again, this time after losing the battle between his psyche and an overwhelming society.  Lines like, &quot;I'm lost at sea/Don't bother me&quot; are the kinds of haunting things we expect to hear from suicidal psychotics.  Even the repeated title of the first song, &quot;Everything in its Right Place,&quot; shows a form of neurosis approaching dementia, a shining example of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  <br />The beats in Kid A feel like they're runningaway.  Just listen to Idioteque once and tell me you don't feel like you're on a treadmill.  It sounds like Yorke is having trouble keeping up, as his voice strains and the song approaches its climax.  It's a work of genius that requires no more words than the overwhelming implications of, &quot;Everything, all the time...&quot;  The mind of the song's protagonist is so caught up in the world's expectations that it has become impossible to focus on just one thing, or even just a few.  Instead, it's everything, all of the time.  Or at least that's what I got out of it.<br />Kid A is a shocking, bewildering, sometimes indecipherable album.  I only hope I can understand some of its themes, and I apologize for those I missed.  <br />I guess it comes down to this:  If you appreciate the painting, &quot;The Scream&quot; by Edvard Munch, you'll probably appreciate this album.  To me, the two have a lot in common.  Neither offers an explanation, both are abstract and disturbing, both are desperate pleas for help and affection in an empty, meaningless existence.  <br />Radiohead may be the most innovative band of our times, mixing folk harmonics with highly synthesized melodies and (sometimes) dance beats.  Having said that, I don't believe this album can exist in a vacuum.  One must understand Radiohead's previous albums to get a grasp of it.  I encourage you to buy and dissect this album, but I doubt much could be culled from its depths without some appreciation of what Radiohead has been saying for the last ten years.  <br />Maybe I've missed the point entirely.  I just wish Roger Waters would write a review so I could find out what it all really means.

0679879269|4.0|This book is a double edged . . . knife. The book is great, there is no denying that. Lyra and Will go through some fantastic adventures jumping between world and even going so far as to go down to the world of the dead.<br />And yet, it has a certain finality about it. A lot of unexpected things happen in this book. The &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; series has enormous potential, especially with the unlimited possibilities that the knife and the compass creates between them. It could easily become another RedWall.<br />It's hard to write the review without revealing the whole story line. But I think that this is the last book in the series. Unless of course Pullman takes the story into a predictable direction. Not likely. Buy the book, All three books together make an excellent read, especially late into the night.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I haven't bought this cd yet...but I have to give the song &quot;Here With Me&quot; 5 stars because it's so wonderful. I'm actually hoping somebody will contact me and help me in finding out whether this song I've heard is by Dido and if it's on the album: I heard it on the fantastic tv show &quot;Roswell High&quot;, I think the song was played on either the second or third episode of the first series and these are the only lyrics I know: &quot;I just want to feel, safe in my own skin, I just want to be, happy again&quot;So if anybody reading this knows the song please let me know who it's by and what it's actually called. Plus anybody who wants to buy this album you should buy it because everybody who has it, say it's fantastic.
0788816454|2.0|I must admit, I do like Adam Sandlers' humor, but his role as Bobbie Buche (however you spell it..) did not fit. Just this whimpering, downcast but mainly uncomfortable look about him, made for a annoying character. And that chick off the Craft, god that role suited her too well; but ended up making the movie worse. Finally, the Col. Sanders refrence made me very cynical...
B0000041Q3|4.0|I won't confess that I love opera and that I listen to it all of the time; in fact, before I heard this recording (and worked on the production with Virginia Opera) I vowed that every opera I had encountered bored me to tears. But after I worked on Turandot I knew I had to get the CD; and who better to listen to than Pavarotti? The first act on the whole is my favorite. It instantly sets the mood with Puccini's grasping orchestrations. The chorus sets the mood for every scene, from blood-thirsty riot to pitiful, pleading mourners and the shift in these moods feel easy and effortless. I'm not so sure that I appreciated maestro's conducting as some parts felt a bit slower than they should have been. In the second act you are sweating with anxiety with the crowd as they anticipate Calaf's answers to Turandot's riddles. Ping, Pang and Pong-Turandot's 'ambassadors' so to speak-provide the comedy and relate the twistedness of the bloody situations. Liu has some of the most heartfelt melodies I have ever heard; you'll love this one. And of course Nessun dorma will leave you cheering for Calaf.
B00003CX7L|5.0|As the mother of two preschoolers, I have had to endure dumb tapes in the house just so I can get a few chores completed before sundown.  I've seen talking babies, cute animals of every species, heroic youngsters of all ethnicities and the prize goes to the toys.  This tape is GREAT!  It is better than the original and that was superb.  Buzz and Woody handle the issue of their own identities as toys.  They also venture out of the neighborhood to a toy store.  The plot is rich and there is a coherent pattern of events but both of my children have been able to pick up the story at any given point and watch straight through.  More importantly, I love this tape and would willingly watch it with them.  The graphics are incredible.  The vocal talents are brilliant.  The plot is sweet and poignant.  The jokes are actually funny to all members of the family and no person should be the least bit embarrassed to watch this cartoon.
B00004XMVL|4.0|When my husband came home from the store with this one I could do nothing but groan. I knew it was going to be terrible and I made no bones about saying so. I had to eat my words. This is actually a good movie.<br />After their ship crashes we find our heroes stranded on a planet that has some deadly surprises lurking about. This planet is inhabited by a very dangerous race of alien monsters that stay in the darkest areas on the planet. Well,since this planet has a total of three suns there shouldn't be any problem. Right? Wrong! We soon find our group in the midst of a total eclipse. Darkness has fallen and the monsters have come out to play.<br />Striking visual effects,good acting,and a few surprises thrown in makes this movie a very enjoyable watch.
B00003CXC7|5.0|While many say Hitch's greatest films are Psycho, Vertigo, &amp; North by Northwest I have to say that 'Rear Window' is more suspenseful than all of his works. Grace Kelly, is of course beautiful &amp; perfect in every way, while James Stewart pulls off his best role ever as a wheelchair bound photographer. But the real star of the show was Thelma Ritter as Stella, the insurance company nurse. <br />The movie takes place the whole time in the two bedroom appartment of L.B. Jeffries, a wheelchair bound photographer, who broke his leg in a auto accident. Jeff (Stewart) is so bored he takes to rear window watching &amp; sees the salesman (Raymond Burr)go out three time on a rainy night carrying a suitcase. The next morning the salesman's wife dissapears, which arouse questions in the mind of Jeff. With his policeman friend, Doyle saying everything that happened has a reasonable explination, Jeff, along with his girlfriend Lisa (Kelly), &amp; nurse Stella (Ritter) decide to solve the case by themselves.<br />The film was considered to provocative by critics, but at the same time they praised Hitch for his classic masterpiece
B000002GZ1|5.0|Now this is a great blues album! Maybe not as great as Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton (released around the same time), but this is good stuff. Who says only 'real blues' can be performed by black dudes? These white guys from Chicago have a ton of soul. This is a great album which any blues fan should own.

6300263673|4.0|...actually, the entire cast is awesome in this low-budget &quot;sleeper&quot; film.  I watch it at least once a year!  As excellent as the entire ensemble cast is in this film, Patrick Swayze truly shines in his dancing and acting talent.  His combination of excitement, energy and consummate grace of movement is something magical - something rare in films.  Unfortunately, Patrick Swayze decided he would rather make 'action' films, rather than look as though he was 'cashing in' on his Dirty Dancing accolades.  It is obvious to this viewer that Patrick Swayze should have picked up where Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire left off and gone on to make more dance-oriented films, including stage performances...I hope that it isn't too late for him (along with his beautiful wife) to do that!  <br />Of course, I should say something about the lovely Jennifer Grey, as well as the rest of the cast, but Patrick's star just shines so brightly in this film.  It is my fervent hope that he decides in the near future to make another dance film.  Thank you, though, for Dirty Dancing!  It is truly a classic!
0060976624|4.0|Rich Baiocco  <br />Review of Thank You For Smoking<br /> Christopher Buckley's ear for political and social satire is in perfect pitch in his latest book Thank You for Smoking.  The book follows protagonist Nick Naylor, a lobbyist for the dreaded Tobacco Industry, through run-ins with kidnappers, confrontations with Oprah, and a barrage of extremely humorous sexual exploits.  Naylor is on a quest to prove to his boss, B.R, that he is worth the money they are paying him to lie and finesse the public into thinking cigarettes are not dangerous.  Nick defends his moral character in the role of the mouth of the merchant of death by claiming he is doing all of this to pay the mortgage and send his son through one of Washington's most elite private schools (St. Euthanasius).  The brilliance of Buckley's writing comes in the fact that the reader is not necessarily on the side of his main character at the beginning for he the defender of such an evil corporate empire.  As the plot twists and turns, we find room in our sympathetic hearts for Nick, and he quickly turns from antagonist to protagonist.  We see a man, who like most Americans, is doing his job and trying to make a living.  In fact his only real obstacle is the moral strain his position is imparting on him lately.  Believe me, as the plot elevates and Naylor faces more and more heated public ignominy we actually feel sorry for him.  Though the story tends to get a bit repetitive at times Buckley's sharp wit and tight comic prose keeps the reader very much engaged.  Nick associates himself with a spokesperson for the NRA and a spokesperson for the Alcohol industry.  They are known amongst each other as the M.O.D squad (Merchants of Death).  Together they comfort and console each others wavering morals, battered and tired from tidal waves of public scorn.    Like I stated earlier, the author has a knack for being able to grasp the evil world of publicity and propaganda behind corporate America.  This book partiallyserves as a comic vehicle to follow the life of one of the country's most hated professionals, and partially as a flashlight to shine clearly upon the public's corruption by the Tobacco Industry.  There is a real message to be learned here about what goes on behind the scenes in giant corporations, and Buckley delivers that message quite honestly, though sometimes heavy-handedly, through his satire.  Thank You for Smoking is a fine accomplishment and marks the writer as one of the premiere social satirists in the game.  I look forward to reading his next one.
0060976624|3.0|\\"Thank You For Smoking\\" made me reconsider my perspective on even the most hated industries (in this case the tobacco industry).  Although likened to Satan, the protagonist, Nick Naylor is just an ordinary person who is doing what he can to keep his job and pay his mortgage.  When put in that perspective, Naylor is even a likable guy--you can hate him for advocating cigarettes, but you can't hate him for being human.  A feminist is more likely to be angry with the protagonist for his objectification of women than a non-smoker is going to hate him for lobbying for the tobacco industry.       Buckley does well in his characterization of the protagonist but slightly lags behind on the others.  What he tells you of the other characters is only what Nick can see, thus giving you more insight to Nick than anyone else.   I picked up this book as a requirement for a class under the sales pitch that it was the \\"funniest book you will ever read.\\"  After opening the cover, I was beginning to wonder if I had left my sense of humor back home because I was simply not finding anything worthy of a chuckle.  However, after pressing on (and may I remind you this was for a class), I found myself thoroughly entertained once Nick was kidnapped by Peter Lorre and the author had proved his cleverness by coming up with Nick's perfect punishment--being covered with nicotine patches!   With this stunt, Buckley had gained my trust and I could finish the book in a more responsive frame of mind.   Although I never would have picked this book up on my own, I found it to be an easy and entertaining piece of writing.  I am glad to have read it because I showed myself that despite being an extremely picky reader, I can once in a while let go enough to broaden my horizons.
0312243022|3.0|As I have never read any of Woolf's work, please judge the following with this caveat. The best part of this book is the beautiful language. The imagery, the sheerness of the author's words made me think that perhaps Cunningham is also a poet! However, with that said, by the end of the book I was disappointed with his lack of character development. It would not have taken him too long to clue us in to the backgrounds of these people. This is especially true in the case of Laura, whom he depicts as a stereotypical fifties housewife, who is exceedingly bright and curious, but feels somewhat trapped. Except for these facts, we learn practically nothing about her at all. With that said, I would still recommend this book for its gorgeous language, and the fact that it also made me want to run out and read Virginia Woolf!
6305127689|5.0|This movie is not simply about fast planes and cool music; it also touches on the thrills and dangers of being a Navy fighter pilot and going up against the best in the world, and also on the hardships of losing a close friend, and falling in love. With the all-star cast led by the Man himself, Tom Cruise, this movie soars above the rest in every regard - sound, video, photography, acting...you name it. If you buy one DVD for your surround sound system, it absolutely MUST be Top Gun.  Only negative about it is there's no trailer included on the DVD...come on Paramount...your top-selling movie of all time DESERVES a trailer on the DVD!!
B00003CWL6|5.0|I read a few negative reviews of this film, and I'm baffled. This film was outstanding. Kevin Spacey is finally getting the recognition he deserves, I thought he should have won an  academy award for, &quot;Swimming with Sharks,&quot; but his portrayal here was equally outstanding. He really conveys in this film, a slice of Americana, no one wants to get old. He truly shows that we may get older outwardly, but the child inside sometimes never truly dies. Mena Suvari, is captivating as the &quot;Lolita- like,&quot; object of his affection. I think Annette Benning was outstanding as his wayward, gold-digging wife, who never  was happy with his career choice. This film is visually  stunning and use imagery to convey it's messages, much like in &quot;What Dreams may come,&quot; with Robin Williams. This is film is definetely, not for children. It's harshly realistic at times, the language is coarse, and there are some scenes that may make people uncomfortable. If you're an open-minded, liberal viewer, you'll probably really enjoy this film. If you are more on the conservative side, and strong material offends you, you might want to look elsewhere.
630289915X|5.0|The only other Christmas story that is more important than Capra's &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; is found in the New Testament of the Bible!  This film is wonderful.  It should be a Christmas tradition for every American family.  The message should resonate through our lives all year long, and not just at Christmas; it is that important of a message.  This edition of the film is wonderful because it is not spoiled by the colorization.  It is Capra's classic Christmas tale as it is meant to be enjoyed, and as it has been enjoyed for more than 50 years.
0671578855|5.0|A thoroughly entertaining novel. I have not read any other work which has attempted to combine these two genres. Bujold sticks pretty close to the standard historical romance plot line but I was still left wondering, for most of the book, whether she would allow Miles and Ekaterin to get together in this book or leave it to the next. The political side of the story is great fun too. Throw in genetic engineering and human psychology, stir, and you have a very good novel indeed. I have not previously met Miles and Co (although I *was* very impressed by &quot;Falling Free&quot;, her novel about the creation on the Quaddies), but I will certainly now go and hunt out the rest of the series.
0226264017|5.0|&quot;Capitalism and Freedom&quot; is certainly a comprehensive and cohesive piece of work that any person, including non-economics majors could pick up and read.  Milton Friedman writes in such a straight-forward, minimalist manner that I am looking forward to reading other books by him.  The thing that impresses me most with regard to Friedman's work is that he views every issue from all angles, he puts forth the argument and the counter-argument and allows the reader the freedom to choose the best approach.
0671027344|5.0|No, I don't have a lot of time on my hands. It's just this book is far from amazing. Midway through the book I fell in love with Charlie which was so fustrating because he was a character in a book and I was merely observing his world. I will just say read the book because if I say more, I will end up telling too much.<br />_natalie_
B000003TA4|5.0|This is one of my favourite albums because it is a mirror of the desperation and the genious of Kurt Cobain. Hear the scream on &quot;Territorial pissings&quot; and you'll understand me. This album contains some of the most unforgettable songs in the 90s, like the classic &quot;Smells like teen spirit&quot;, the great&quot;In bloom&quot;, the genial&quot; Come as you are&quot;, and the bizarre &quot;Lithium&quot;, but there are others pieces that entered in the Nirvana's trademark, like the sad &quot;Something in the way&quot;, the desperate &quot;Territorial pissings&quot;, the acoustic &quot;Polly&quot;, the pop-ish &quot;on a plain&quot; and the angry &quot;Breed&quot;. Then there are others underrated songs that, in my opinion, are different but superb too. The best, in my opinion, is &quot;Lounge act&quot;, but there are also &quot;Stay away&quot; and &quot;Drain you&quot;. Buy this album, you'll learn to love it. Then, if it will .... you, so you can continue with the others nirvana's masterpieces. Love, peace and empaty!
6305897786|4.0|This is without a doubt a complex and dreamlike film which refuses to make things simple for the viewer.  Johnny Depp almost sleepwalks through this film and thats precisly the way this role needed to be played, ever so slightly detached from reality and leaving you wondering how real everything really is. Roman Polanski's wife Emmanuelle is suitably ambiguous and Lena Olin seductivly evil while Frank Langella is probably at his weakest and seriously overplays some of his scenes.   It seems that a lot of people are having real trouble understanding the end of this film.  I think its probably a case of it being one of those films which doesn't necessarily  set out everything on a silver platter for you and also is deliberatly ambigous.  What I'm going to say now is my take on it so obviously its full of spoilers but I will try to hold something back so people can watch it and make up there own minds.<br />The ending  -SPOILER- The riddle refered to in the pages of the book is supposed to conjour up the Devil in the flesh.  The faked  picture depicts the Whore of Babylon which is traditionally depicted as a woman riding on a Seven headed beast.  Depending on which interpretation of the Whore you read it could be a person, place, country or even a religion but in this case it appears the Whore is a person and a common reading of the passages is that the Whore is the precursor to the anti-christ.  This person was introduced with references to Witches and pacts with the Devil.  The true picture shown at the end shows the whore triumphant in front of a castle (the castle) with light streaming from the castle.  A scene a couple of minutes previously showed the castle in flames (light) and given the actions in the foreground it doesn't take a genius to figure out the way the Devil has found to make himself flesh.<br />I may be wrong with my reading of the ending of the film but it actually made perfect sense to me the first time I watched it but to tell the truth I think its one of those films that deliberatly wants you to question just what its ending really means.  I'd recommend this film to any Polanski fans, fans of occult films like the Omen, as well as fans of films without easy endings like Se7en.  I'd definitly warn off people who prefer their endings cut and dried or full of action.
B00003Q438|4.0|Yeah...Yeah... The movie is great.  The added scenes were nice and more informative, especially towards the end.  This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over and see new things on every viewing.  The detail, story, acting and bonus materials are all top-notch.  But I see here that some people are complaning about the added scenes...  well, duh, that's why both the theatrical AND special edition versions are included.<br />Like many other Cameron Films, it was shot in Super 35, not Widescreen.  So the best way to view this movie is in the standard 4x3 acedemic format... which is sorely missing from the DVD.  I would think that with movies shot in Super 35, they would have standard AND anamorphic widescreen versions.  Instead they just give you the letterbox version, which only serves those that have $5000+ 2.35:1 Big Screen TVs-- and even those few people are missing the upper and lower halves of the movie!  I know people, who are screaming for widescreen on DVD, may object to 4x3 - but do an internet search on &quot;Super 35&quot; and you'll see why it's much better to watch them on a standard TV.  So it's a pity that you'll have to wait for it to come out on TV just to see those parts of the picture.  I realize that you can't please 100% of all the people all the time, but by just having the letterbox versions on a special edition DVD shot in Super 35, they are really making it better for less than 2% of the people!
B00004T37H|5.0|When I first heard about this anime I was interested in it and got information from other sites on the Internet. Though the sites were good they didn't give me the &quot;must see&quot; feeling. I saw Princess Mononoke for rent in a video store I go to and I rented it for a night thinking I would watch it once and return it the same night. Wrong. The graphics were great and the plot was awesome. I've never seen a better anime. I really hope everyone at least rents this movie. I'm going to buy it as soon as I can! I hope everyone enjoys this video as much as I did! It was great!!
6305342776|5.0|Well, this is a strange movie, but a very good one.  The story is great, very good FX, good music, and remarkable ambience... Even if you compare the dated special effects (since 1979) you will realize that are very good done... In special the oustanding black hole... (There are some obvius mistakes: a real balck hole is invisible, the people exposed to the empty space die, the meteors move fast and nothing human made could &quot;drive&quot; one: like the big one which run inside the Cygnus...) That mistakes, and some little bugs on the picture never take away your attention from this good movie... Simply: a must have.
6302820448|5.0|What a great movie!  I love the idea of getting the chance to try again until we get it right.
B000000WA4|4.0|I know this isn't a forum or anything but I just felt I had to get this off my chest.<br />When I first started listening to stuff off the mainstream, the Pumpkins were one of the first bands I picked up. My first album was Siamese Dream. I didn't really like it back then. (I was about 15) But looking back, I realize how great an album it really is...but I disgress...<br />Anyway, I was really excited when I heard they were coming out with a double CD. I was also really sad cause the thing wiped out a good part of my allowance at the time. I still think it's a great album after so long, but like Cid, I haven't listened to it for very long,due to a friend 'borrowing' it and I never saw it again. Anyhow,this is also the last SP cd I enjoyed. I bought ADORE expecting something like Mellon Collie but was bitterly disappointed...In short, if you're deciding which SP album to get and you're a new listener, get this..Corgan's writing and music doesn't really get much better than this
0679879269|5.0|The richness of The Amber Spyglass is unmatched. I have never read a more absorbing, more powerful book then The Amber Spyglass. A shocking revelation is made on the icy Mrs. Coulter: love. Will, angry from Lyra's kidnapping, storms into action and tries to rescue his friend back. Dr. Mary Malone builds a magnificent amber spylglass that has the power to see Dust, the mysterious golden substance that no one has known the meaning of. All the while Lord Asriel is busy with war and makes an<br />alliance for the better that will mean a sacrifice. In the stunning and masterful conclusion of the His Dark Materials trilogy, Phillip Pullman brings out the message that the other two books The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife brought out too. Only in the ending of this book it is a message so powerful, a message so meaningful, that it is beyond anything you can imagine. I recommend the His Dark Materials trilogy to anyone, whether you hate to read, or you love to read, because to me, it is absolutely the most fantastic three books I've ever read.
B00004YYDI|4.0|This is one of my favorite films.  Dealing with the love of an older man and a young girl, but done tastefully and never crossing the line.  The Professional is a love story, surrounded by wonderful characters  and the violence they introduce into a young girls life.  By the way, the young girl, played by Natalie Portman, is perfect in this film.  When I bought this DVD, I was excited to see the additional 24 minutes of footage.  I popped the DVD into my player and was impressed by the simple, yet beautiful menu design.  You click, there is an explosion, and you arrive at your destination!  Your audio choices are between a 2-Track Dolby Digital for simple 2 speaker set-ups and a 5.1 Track Dolby Digital for advanced systems.  Either way, this DVD is a beautiful audio experience.  Stereo spearation and ambiance are wondeful to listen to.  Vocals are clean and clear, and the deep bass will definitely test your speaker system.  The widescreen picture was VERY impressive.  Colors are beautiful and the picture is clean and beautifully rendered.  The inclusion of the 24 minutes was fun to watch and flawlessly fits itself into the American version that we already know.  In one way, I'm not sure why these deleted scenes were not part of the American release, but on the other hand, they really weren't necessary to the film.  Some may say it slows the pace down, while others may say the deleted scenes include things not appropriate for some viewers.....either way, I enjoyed seeing them simply because I love viewing deleted scenes.  The package also included the trailers and the international ad campaign.  This is a great disc to own.  The film is great, and the picture and sound quality is fantastic.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a film with a great story and any fan of Jean Reno.  Enjoy!
0790729733|1.0|One of my all time favorites is treated like dirt on DVD.  A HORRIBLE transfer.  Keep you VHS copy until they rerelease this.  It also has next to nothing for extras and it's a dual layer (flipper) disc (long movie of course but not long enough to warrant this since DVD holds 4 hours on each side).  This was one of the first films to be put on DVD so maybe all this isn't surprising and I'm sure it will be rereleased... but c'mon Warner Bros., HURRY UP ALREADY!<br />So if you are considering buying JKF on DVD - WAIT.
0140284095|5.0|An ideal gift for any post-adolescent speaker of English who isn't already familiar with Wodehouse. (If he is familiar with Wodehouse -- well, it's impossible to read just one, so you likely would be too late.) Order several copies today -- you'll avoid the Christmas Eve rush, and your recipients will be grateful ever after.
630521610X|5.0|&quot;Scream&quot; revived the horror genre, and created one of the scariest films ever made.  A sadistic serial killer stalks the teenagers of a small town, specifically, the daughter of a woman who was murdered exactly one year ago.  Directed by horror master, Wes Craven, &quot;Scream&quot; promised to be THE horror film of the 90s, and followed up on that promise.  The DVD is fantastic; loaded with extras such as: 3 Behind the Scenes Featurettes, Audio Commentary, Theatrical Trailers, TV Spots, Film Facts, Q&amp;A w/ the cast and crew and so much more.  This is THE horror dvd!
6304341849|5.0|I first read E.M. Forster's novel &quot;Maurice&quot; in college.  The movie brings to life all the same emotions and images Mr. Forster's book brought to life in my head, only with a great soundtrack!<br />It's the story of a young man's coming to terms with his sexuality in pre-WW I Edwardian England.  Homosexuality is still illegal and as upperclassmen very taboo to even be associated with someone who might &quot;morally&quot; corrupt those who are socially beneath them.<br />The story really begins when Maurice begins his second term at college where he meets fellow classmate Clive Durham (Hugh Grant).  Clive, exploring his own sexuality (albeit Platonic), falls in love with Maurice.  At first Maurice is horrified, but later the two find a kind of happiness together, which must be kept secret from everyone else.  Maurice is content, although it's an asexual relationship.  Eventually their relationship dissolves and Clive chooses to marry, thus carrying on his lineage and coming into his inheritance.<br />Maurice is crushed, and eventually seeks help to &quot;cure&quot; him by means of a hypnotist (very well played by Ben Kingsley).<br />Maurice eventually falls in love with Clive's gamekeeper (note the D.H. Lawrence influence here!).  He finds happiness at last despite the British Class system.<br />The cast is superb, from James Wilby (Maurice) and Rupert Graves (Scudder) and Hugh Grant (Clive).  If you've read the book (and I recommend that you do!) then you'll notice a few differences here and there.  The story is basically the same, one of the best Merchant/Ivory productions!  You'll see some familiar faces, even a cameo by Helena Bonham-Carter!  Unfortunately, with the success of Hugh Grant and his recent films, video versions of &quot;Maurice&quot; give James Wilby second billing even though Wilby is the star.  And he shines!
6305137293|5.0|&quot;Halloween 2,&quot; picking up exactly where &quot;Halloween&quot; left off, is as scary and entertaining as the original.  Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie) and Donald Pleasance (Dr. Loomis0 reprise their popular roles trying to defeat serial killer, Michael Myers, stalking Laurie in a nearby Hospital.  DVD's picture is a little dark, and the extras are limited to Production Notes, however, &quot;Halloween 2&quot; will be a sequel to remember!
0786915749|5.0|I was fortunate enough to pick this trilogy up in its collector's edition, a couple of years ago.  This was the first fantasy book I had ever read and is what hooked me on the genre.<br />If you have not read this story, you must go out and get the book.  Out of the three books there is no singular one that stands out above ther rest.  I loved them all.
1558908498|4.0|&quot;Scream 2&quot; is by far, one of the best sequels to ever grace the silver screen.  Funny, intense and terrifyingly scary, these elements make up this above average sequel.  Away in college, Sidney Prescott tries to escape her shocking past, but, history does repeat itself when a copycat killer comes to town.  DVD Picture is good, but a little dark, and the sound is excellent.  However, I was very disappointed to see that this was not a Collector's Edition DVD.  The only extra is the theatrical trailer.  None the less, this is a very entertaining DVD.
0679879269|4.0|After reading the first two books in three days, I could not wait to get ahold of this one and I stayed up all night to read it.  Although it is very good, it does not quite live up to the first two.  I love it because it is an excellent book - something that is rare these days.  I hate it because it is disturbing.  Although he makes the book sound so hopeful and happy at the end, once you think about it, the universe he leaves you with is absolutely hopeless.  I did not so much have a problem with the way he treated Christianity, as I did with the empty world he gives us.  As for letting children read this...  I hate the idea of restricting children from reading books, especially ones that encourage imagination, but I would be careful with this book.  It would take a very bright child to get this book.  The first two were great for all ages, but this third one is hardly a children's book.  In fact, most adults won't understand most of what is discussed in it.  So parents, be careful with this book.  I'm not saying that because it's bad, but because it will take a special child to read it.
055321263X|5.0|&quot;The Woman in White&quot; is a great, semi-Gothic suspense novel. The most abundant element is of course mystery and Collins has truly come up with an enduring mystery novel. Sensation novels were popular in their time and Collins was one of the best. This mystery is interesting to follow, highly entertaining and masterfully written in the Victorian style. Collins is no Bronte or Austen but can still make a narrative following the standards of the period writing style. The novel contains much of the typical elements of a sensation novel- an endangered heroine, mistaken identity, dark familial secrets and a lot of plotting and scheming. It is well worth the read.
6305177856|5.0|American Graffiti is an excellent film.It's both funny and moving.The plot is very simple:a group of friends having one last night of fun before entering adulthood.The soundtrack of oldies rock is absolutely amazing.The cast is almost like a who's who of stars to be.The film was made on a very low budget and it's much better than many films with much larger budgets.I'd recommend it to anyone.
6302648750|5.0|Zumeckis casted a brilliant bunch (Steep, Hawn and Willis), had a witty and humorous dialogue and amazing special effects. The film is a satirical attack on the obscession for eternal youth and beauty. The aging rivals Merryl and Hawn battle for the love of Willis and make a Faustian bargain with a witch (played by Isabella Rossalini) who concocts a potion that makes them appear younger. However, disaster strikes and through special effects wizardry and a lot of comedic action, the three are become involved in a great conflict. The joke is that although they are rotting away, they still concern themselves with looks. This is a deeply entertaining dark comedy and a must have on the video collection. Great performances by Willis, Streep and Hawn and Rossalini as the Enchantress who abodes a cryptic mansion where no one ever ages.... and this film cannot age or tire. It is still as fresh and funny as its initial release in 1991. Enjoy!
B00004XPOZ|5.0|The Star Wars trilogy is three of the most entertaining movies ever.The good vs.evil plot is excellent,the special effects are spectacular(I personally think they're just as good as most of today's computer generated ones),and the soundtrack by John Williams is one of the very best.You just can't help but like the three main charactors,and,of course, Darth Vader is probably the best screen villain ever.While I also enjoyed Star Wars Episode I,it just isn't in the same class as these three.If anyone out there who has seen episode I hasn't seen these three,(not likely!)YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE MISSING!!
B0000507UD|5.0|Before this cd came out i didnt think it would be able to compare with Significant Other. but Limp Bizkit's combination of rock and rap blew me away when i heard this cd. definitely one worth buying.  The intro is dope, hot dog is one of the best songs with it hard rock beat, its has both versions of rollin which sound like 2 different songs both of which are great,Getcha Groove on with Exzhibit is one of the best songs and none of the songs slack off at all.
0679416781|5.0|The English Patient is a story about love, friendships, war and how all of these intertwine to become a novel about four lives and how they are entangled in ways the reader would have never thought.  The setting of the desert and the italian villa in the time of world war 1 brings A fictional love story into a historical time period and captivates the reader.  We want the english patient to continue with his story so we learn more of Katharine.  We want the bombs dismantled because in a way Kip's only other passion excluding the bombs is Hana and her body, soul, her being as a whole.  We want to be told of the curve in Katharine's neck and The episodes in the tent.  We need to be told how to read it and when to slow down.  We need to hear what Kip says when hearing of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.  These are life lessons that need to be learned.  I loved this book for the lessons it taught me and the romantic tales of woe that captivated my imagination.  I wanted to be in Hana's place or even Kip's place.  I want to be playing hide and seek in the library and I want to  hit my knees from the pain that just seperated my soul.  This was a great book, the only part you could play with is Katharine.  She has no voice and may need one.  We feel a male opinion of her and not her opinion of herself or the english patient.  The other thing I had to say was that caravaggio even though he was not really developed as deeply, he played an important role and that was an interesting way to portay a character.  Give him no hands and just about as much personality  and then give him the most important role.  Finding out who the English Patient really is.  Interesting.
B00004XONN|5.0|Appart from being a really good album, it really widened my taste in music. Just to mention an example, I heard Bitches Brew because of something Jonny Greenwood mentions about the composition ideas used for \\"The National Anthem\\".
B000006GDB|3.0|This is yet again another good film from horror genius DarioArgento. Again, Dario delivers great style and atmosphere withInferno. I am being careful not to praise this version of the film toomuch, or give it too many stars. This version is probably a US versionthat is cut. If you already don't know; Argento has recently releaseda collector's edition of the film. I have not seen the collector'sedition which probably has scenes restored, that have been cut fromthis version.  Inferno is still a very good film but it is thecollector's edition is probably a better version of this film.
B000002MUW|5.0|Bedtime Stories is one of Madonna's best works (alongside Erotica, Ray Of Light, Like A Prayer, etc). This time Madonna goes R&amp;B, and she does it very well. Survival is a fun song, kind of autobiographical for Madonna about surviving despite what everyone puts against her. Secret is the first single, with a sing along hook that you will always remember. I'd Rather Be Your Lover is a heavy R&amp;B type song that will make you wanna dance, like Don't Stop (which in fact was a single on some radio stations that didnt want to play Human Nature). Inside of Me is a lush ballad which is very dreamy. Human Nature is the controversial song where Madonna faces her critics who are judgemental about everything she does. Forbidden Love is a jazzy type song. Love Tried To Welcome Me is another lush ballad and she sounds wonderful. Santuary is another beautiful song where she sings very well, which leads into the title track Bedtime Story which is a preview in a way of things to come (Ray Of Light), Bjork wrote this song and its the highlight of the album in my opinion. The album closes with Take A Bow, a ballad in which Babyface wrote and lends his voice to.<br />Let Down Your Guard was the bside to Secret, and everyone says its a bad song but i like it. Its a very R&amp;B influenced song and its fun. This album is basically a light headed fun album, with the occasional sad songs. Its a great album and I highly reccomend it.
0060976624|5.0|Both smokers and non-smokers will enjoy this well written novel; Thank You for Smoking offers marvelously witty and satirical insight into the warped political value system of Americans today.  Head tobacco spokesman Nick Naylor has the most deplorable job in the country, but he enjoys his work as much as anyone else.  We all have to &quot;pay the mortgage&quot;.  With his incompetent boss, endless public relations assignments, active sex life, and young son, Nick struggles to keep his life in order.  But when a non-smoking zealot takes it too far, Nick is forced to take his chances.
B000002MFN|5.0|Forget everything you've heard about Erotica, because most of what you heard probably isnt true. This is one of Madonna's most complete albums to date, even more than Ray of Light or her current album Music. Erotica explores the many sides of sex and sexuality. Most would think since its Madonna, its done without taste. Some songs are a little racy in content but if you truly listen you will understand what a great album is. The album well represented music at the time. Its a very dancy album, but at the same time a little dark.<br />The title song is mainly about sex and bondage, which she starts out by introducing the album's main character with the line &quot;My name is Dita...I'll be your mistress tonight&quot;. Fever is a remake of the Peggy Lee hit which has a very nice dance beat. Bye Bye Baby is a fun little song about breaking up. Deeper and Deeper reflects the 70's in many ways, and also has an addictive beat with captivating lyrics. Where Life Begins is a jazzy little number about 'dining in' and exploring sexual fantasies. Bad Girl is a nice ballad as with a sing along chorus and melody. Waiting is a song which implies what the title says, the frustration of waiting. Theif of Hearts is a comical type song (or comes across as) about a woman stealing her man. Words is a nice little song about the confusion of words. Rain is a lush ballad which we will always remember. Why's It So Hard and In This Life both deal with society having trouble accepting individuals for who they are, and the pain it causes. Did You Do It is a song that was only available on the Explicit version of this album, it was not released on the Edited Erotica cd. The album closes with Secret Garden, a beautiful jazzy type song. The album ends at about 75 minutes, this is her most complete work, not because of the length of the album, but because it explores life and is done very well.<br />Many think of Madonna has a bad woman for her work like this, but its very very good. She is teaching us, and if she has to be a little nasty then good for her for expressing herself, they are only words, which have different interpretations from person to person. This is an absolute must have.
B00004T1NA|3.0|This is typical of most bands that release a great work of art (Stupid Dream). I like the fact that Steve Wilson has focused more on writing songs than on longer and longer psychedelic jams. Lightbulb Sun falls short. It is a poor continuation of what he was perfecting on &quot;Stupid Dream&quot; The song &quot;The rest will flow&quot; is a waste of tape. I cannot believe that the other members of the band let this song on this CD. It is like Porcupine Tree wants to compete with The Cranberries. This is an average CD. The first 4 songs are great! &quot;Hate Song&quot; and &quot;Russia On Ice&quot; are good as well, but nowhere near the talent exhibited on the previous 3 CD's. He's slipping. I'm sure the next CD will be some self-indulgent garbage that features long prog. songs that everyone can &quot;trip out&quot; to. Porcupine Tree has become predictable. &quot;Steve, I know your next move before you do&quot; If you don't have the previous 2 CD's (Stupid Dream &amp; Signify), you should go get them today. Don't waste time with the new one until you're educated enough to realize it's flaws. As a single album I would rate it as a 6. Comparisons to Radio Head are absolutely ridiculous. Radio head sucks. They suck live and he can't sing. Radio Head appeals to sophomoric amateurs who are confused by all the poor music being released in the main stream. Radio Head is in the top 3 most tallentless groups on the planet. Aside from the current PT release, Radio Head is a joke compared to Porcupine Tree. This is the truth, so disputes are not allowed
B000002N3J|5.0|Madonna's 1995 album Something To Remember was almost an 'apology' to the public for her ways (in my opinion there was no need for apology, but the album serves well as a collection of her greatest works). Something To Remember implies what the title says, songs that are something to remember. Its a collection of her lush ballads from her hits from Live To Tell to Take A Bow. There are 3 new tracks. I Want You is a remake of the Marvin Gaye song, it was a single for a short while but was pulled when she recorded You'll See, and decided that should be a single. Two versions of I Want You on here, regular and orchestral version, Massive Attack helps on this song. You'll See is one of her best ballads ever, though they are all great. One More Chance is the last new song, another power ballad. Other favorite hits include Rain, I'll Remember, Oh Father, Something To Remember, Forbidden Love and many many more. This is a must for fans of music!
B00004U8H4|5.0|I find satire sometimes a toss up, as far as, will I like tomorrow.  But this movie I will LOVE forever.  As dark and evil as it is, it clearly, shows us that not killers come in the same package.  Which adds more depth to his character.<br />Christian Bale and Reese Witherspoon are brilliant in bringing their characters to life.<br />This movie I believe is under rated by those who pass satire off as &quot;over the top&quot; or &quot;uncomprehensible&quot;.  But this movie is hilarious and black.  And the satire is breath taking.  I hate that phrase but it's true.<br />Watch this - ready to have a sense of humor.  You'll feel bad at what you're laughing at - but remember, it is satire.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Limp Bizkit has rocked on to their third album, but it isnt the best.  i admit, it rocks, but if you are looking for the best, then go for significant other, but otherwise, this album ROCKS... all the hype was DEFINITELY worth it
B000050IMG|5.0|This movie's hillarious.You'll laugh till..till.darnit you're gonna laugh a lot!this movie mocks everything and it's momma..You'd be a lot better off watching i know what you did last summer 1 and to, and all the screams before you go see it, that way  you'd probably find this movie a lot more funny, because you'd get all the jokes.But it's not all potty humor.all thought that's 3/4 of it.There's some stuff in here that could make the pope laugh.This is a must buy if you like horror movies but need a good laugh every once in a while.
B000003FIQ|4.0|Oistrakh is more brooding, sombre and &quot;Finnish&quot; (which is remarkable for a Russian).
B00003CX8I|4.0|This movie was pretty darn cool.I think the actors were pretty much fit for the roles in this one.It starts off with everybodys favorite superheroe(im a spiderman person myself:))doing underground fighting for money.He runs into a fellow mutant girl is cold to her at first and, blah blah blah,you know what happens.Sure the whole Manly wolverine bonding with some little shy depressed girl sounds cheesy(and sort of is) It's not bad at all once the movie develops.Anyways,wolvie is brought into the mutant academy, he hates it at first, then starts to like it.I say no more of the story line.Now, the special effects were really,really cool.And back to acting for a moment, wolverine really acts like you think he would given the attitude marvel has developed.Also, they find room for humor in an action movie like this, and hey!,Its actually funny!Now this movie wont get 5 stars from me for one reason,WHERE IS GAMBIT?!Is he using the restroom?out playing cards with his cajun buddies?At an autograph session?I dont know.However, he will to my knowledge be in x men to.This was a good superheroe movie.get this, especially if your the slightest bit of an x men fan or love the comics.
B00003CWTI|1.0|Great casting, but horrible movie.  I thought with such great actors, this movie would be far better than it was.  The story line was somewhat dis-jointed, and it was so dark and depressing, I honestly don't know how anybody would want to actually OWN the movie. This film seems to want to be 'Pulp Fiction' with various story lines happenning, but it doesn't come together in such a nice way.  It was bizarre, but not in any sort of endearing way.  Very bad.
630575067X|5.0|Hey, i know youve already seen this movie, if youre like me, then youve seen it hundreds of times.Given the 5 stars i gave to this movie, you're probably thinking &quot;This is just one of those die hard star wars freaks whod give it 5 stars even if it was pitifull.&quot;Well, then you'd only be half right.This movie didn't sink in the first time i watched it.Then i bought the movie, watched it, and i realized how cool it was.I think so many people thought this movie let them down because they were expecting to much.With anything that ha sstar wars in front of it,everyone expects it to be a milestone in every sense of the word.Well, i think the movie was great.I'm sure it made a lot more star wars freaks out of a lot of kids, and attracted some of the old kodgers (no offense guys) who where there when the first ones came out, to go see this one.I think it is a milestone.It introduces a few ill-known actors,and puts them in an excellent movie.The acting and special effects where great.The story was also excellent.I cant wait till E2 comes out.....
