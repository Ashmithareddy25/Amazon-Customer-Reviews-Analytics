B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great as described! Would buy again for my wife's car.
B00J8OR4LW|5|so much more lightweight than the original, with time we will see its durability. but for now, acceleration has gone better!
B009DJYDFW|5|I ordered this a few months ago for my 2002 Ford Taurus SES after my old one was damaged in an accident. It looks great and I received it faster than the estimated time for delivery.
B005TTZOU8|5|This is a must have for any lifted jeep to recenter the rear axle. Very happy with JKS products.
B00O8RV0GO|1|Neither of the floor LEDS worked and only three of the interior lights worked.
B00L847KGE|5|Easy installation and great performance.
B0033CQ94S|4|Alright. Better then oem. Great add on for quicker spooling. But if u want long lasting power I would go to AMS manifolds, better quality, and are made of iron. Better for the bigger turbo upgrades especially.
B00T9SSA6U|5|So not only is this helmet comfortable but I mean really comfortable I'm about 6'4, got a big noggin but the xl works great for me!! And looks sharp!!
B0068N1B0Q|2|Appears to be well made with sturdy plastic frame and quality filter material; however, the white gasket surrounding the frame is too thick.  The filter would not fit properly in my filter box.  I returned the filter to Amazon.  My car is a 2008 Subaru Outback 2.5i.
B000CIT3N0|5|Great filter for the Mobil Extended Life oil.
B006U42QUC|5|Great
B002E387MO|5|My aunt was having trouble with her turn signs on her 2002 Impala.And by the way she is 91 and still driving. After reviewing the problem replaced the switch its been 3 weeks and still working. Also by the way Dorman has a great video on how to change it.
B000EQ191E|5|great pad for the price, i was doing about 170 mph the other day in the ricky bobby dodge, going into calamity corner, was side by side with a chevy did some bump drafting and was on to checkers, was able to stop quickly in victory lane get drunk , take the misses to vegas<br />and spend  more money!!!! love these pads!!!
B007PVHVO0|5|Nice fit. Less than 5 minutes to install.
B00FB3MT7S|1|Not worth the money its all one piece, not a true decal.
B00T8MRCMK|5|These spotlights are great. Wired them up in a day and love them. I did have a small leak in two but no big deal, just dry them out run a little silicone around the lens problem solved. Definitely can't use them on the road, way too bright. They came well packed not damaged at all. They easily light up the backroads.
B00MZMQD8E|3|Nice looking
B007KFMJLQ|2|I am quite disappointed with the performance of the front rotors I purchased them 3 months ago for my SUV (replaced pads, rotors and calipers). A couple of years ago I purchased the rear rotors as an upgrade to the factory rotors. They went on easily and performed very well. When it came time to do the front I went with Power Stop on the front. I had Power Stop on the rear... why not? The install was simple enough and I followed the instructions to ensure the warranty would be legit just in case they did go out within the first 30 days or 500 miles (whichever comes first). After 30 days and after the 500 miles, my brakes started to shudder on a road trip to the Grand Canyon. I could really tell something was wrong when going down a mountain highway (Interstate 40) in Arizona. I noticed that it was worse after an hour of driving... after the car was warmed up. I am a conservative driver but I was really conservative with the brakes acting the way they were. Once our road trip was done, I noticed that the brakes now feel like they pulse when the brakes are cool and shudders when I have been driving for more than an hour. I have an appointment scheduled with a local brake shop to check the rotors out. I am hoping that they can remedy the problem without the high cost of replacing the rotors. If I have to replace, I can do the job myself but I will not buy Power Stop.
B00W2XFY0Y|5|It was so easy to install and it looks great...
B003FG4SKE|2|Not as bright as I thought, should of believed ratings and testimonials on these lights. Yes they do have that HID Xenon look but not as bright.
B00D3298A0|5|Good color, great for the price!
B007V2BUTK|5|Super sun shield; Get's the done!
B00RR1I5UC|5|These decals are great!
B00P2D3VZG|4|2013 f150. Bought these to replace some other led bulbs I had originally bought as a set. However, due to the bulb socket rusting/ corroding out (not from the bulb) it damaged my one led. All in all these are decent bulbs and I think the product quality is a little better than some other ones i've seen. Only thing that really erks me is they are not the same spectrum(color) as my previous led's and do not match the set. These give off a white color where as the old ones gave a blueish. Still nice bright bulbs and much better than stock.
B00192HPOC|4|Great product and will purchase again for next new camper.
B000BKEBO0|5|Great stuff for fixing trackball rubber-foot-falling-off problems.  This soft silicone is great on peripherals that need to stay put.  Simply clean the spot and apply thin bead and this will conform and adhere well.  Let cure without touching anything for about a day.  Once cured, the peripheral will have great feet under it again.
B00C33OOVS|5|This is a really nice product! I received them (2 sets) very quickly without any issue. I placed one set on my cleaned window with ease. One funny note was that when I installed it, removing the backing on the sticker and placing it on my window, I didn't realize that the front (top) also had a removable film. I didn't like it until my (smiling) wife pointed out my silly error. After laughing at myself and removing the top film, I really liked what I saw. It's well made. Good color (red). Easy to install (despite my error). I'm very satisfied, good deal!!<br />Thank you.
B000WJA5F4|5|its RAM stuff!!!!  what else can I say?  simply the best!
B00KNXACFC|5|Good quality.. Thanks for the batteries.
B00TOZUS7M|5|Excellent it works like a charm thanks alot
B00164XD12|4|Does the job it was designed for.
B0091OE6K6|5|Finally I'm not being choked by my seatbelt
B003YMX0SK|5|Arrived in great condition, went on perfectly, can't beat the price.
B00AM0WA1U|4|Works exactly as described. Perhaps a bit pricey for what is basically a simply bit of plastic, but it fits well and doesn't look cheap. I didn't use any of the adhesive fasteners - so we can remove it as needed without risking any residue being left behind - and it stays in place no problems.
B000CRGPXM|2|These seats seem nice until you sit in them. Im 6' 2&#34; and have sat in many racing seats, many times my larger friends particularly wider won't fit into certain seats i do. These seats have nice lower support but the upper support does not pan out around my shoulder stops my spine from contacting the backrest. Its extremely uncomfortable. Also the sliders are cheap, the way the slider bar engages to the sliders is just stamped steel bent out that barely fits into the holes on the adjustment bar. Other sliders in this price range and cheaper have nice studs welded onto the sliders for the adjustment bar to fit onto.
B00BOWT4CS|4|Great little bag.  I have this on my 2006 Honda VTX Cruiser attached to the Sissy Bar.  It looks like it was designed to be there.  The material feels to be built to last.  Fits the necessities.  I ordered it through Amazon and got it in 2 days.  Hope this helps.
B00JI8ADCA|5|as advertised
B001HR2AQC|5|Fit and function is as expected.
B0089MR086|5|Great replacement
B007H2Q6QQ|5|Great item!!!!
B00A0R015M|5|Strong pins and they work as they should.
B004L5IVX8|5|installed in 1.5 hours...Truck likes it....thus I like it.
B000FPZRDA|5|I've used this on my anchor for 3-4 times this season. It seems to be holding up well and I have no complaints at this point.
B004RNR9QY|5|Many people do not think twice before watering their organic garden with garden hoses filled with chemicals. Especially when the hose stays in the sun for awhile, the chemicals seep even more into the water stagnating within the hose. Your veggies are not organic anymore! Even if you do not have a veggie garden, why contaminate your soil with harsh chemicals? There is an accumulating effect if watering daily. I am going to order 3 more to replace all my garden hoses.
B00681BFJU|5|Just as described in ad.
B00CC4K868|3|The leather is a little thinner than I imagined and  I should have ordered longer tassels but never the less they are on my bike and in good use.
B00VPI09AM|5|Very happy thanks
B00BVPOC20|4|It's a good part, but there's no way it was EVER $35.00 from the retailer. I get sick and tired of shady dealing. $15.00 is a good price. You can get it for $10.00 but $15.00 is fine. There's no need to lie about it being deeply discounted. Stop f@%$ing around... please.
B002BG4WX2|5|works great
B00I0H27EW|5|Love it
B00DU6R7R0|5|Very nice helmet at a good price
B00W2OSK7C|5|I couldn't be happier!  I was a little concerned because some of the pictures make them look gray and I have black interior.  But what I received were black. They fit great and shipping was fast!
B00E9ANSGU|5|shipped fast , works great...
B009DNW1SO|5|great deal, super fast shipping
B00P2D41OQ|5|Does not fit 09 silverado but I put em in my bosses f250 and they are bright
B006X8BR8C|5|Received within a few days of ordering and product was very easy to install myself. Took about 25 minutes. Looks really excellent on dark green 05 siverado.
B008OIGAZY|5|Good quality. Delivered on time.
B0031HQBE8|3|Didn't fit my truck to long had to cut to get on plastic tub
B0009I1WFA|1|THERE IS ONLY 2 (TWO) , I ORDERED THESE BASED ON THE ANSWER THAT THERE WAS 4 IN THIS PACKAGE-THAT IS A LIE!!!! THERE IS ONLY 2 (TWO) AND YES I AM PISSED!!! I AM SENDING THESE BACK- ........IS EVERYTHING A SCAM????????
B0073VB148|5|works and fits great
B00ZVJ2T0O|5|Need to protect your new cars seats?  This is the thing to get!  I have leather seats and was looking for protection.  I was not going to be paying hundreds of dollars to get removable seat covers.  These do the job that expensive ones do.  Protect seats from liquids, solids, gums, pen marks..everhthing.
B008CQUVN0|5|I Luv It!...Delivery On Time...Great to do Business With! ツ
B002ESEMXC|1|The pad I received does not fit my 1995 Dodge Dakota, it is much too narrow.
B005IY3XDY|5|Good quality
B00C59RT1C|5|I have not installed the pump as of yet but appears to be just what I need.  Fast shipping.  Thanks
B000P4WYKK|5|Service with amazon was great as always. The product is just awesome! With this installed the temp of my truck is even lower than it was with the original part. It's only been a week or so, but I'm very happy with this so far. It's a much better alternative to what the local parts stores had to offer and the cost was even thirty dollars less!
B00FBP1OGS|5|love the sticker.  its on my car right now.
B00C7Y6S8U|3|it was missing a part the light balls
B003UBGAN2|5|This cable works great with the iPhone 5 and 6, as long as it's paired with an actual Apple adapter (the cheap, generic adapters did not work at all with this!)
B00IJQOJEU|5|I put this in my 2006 Pontiac GTO 6spd manual. It was a little tight, but I got it in there. This will be the fourth radiator in my car since I bought it new in '06. All of the previous radiators had plastic end tanks that eventually cracked. Giving it 5 stars for now. If it fails, Ill reduce it.
B005R4L1N4|5|Very easy to install, but if you dont have reverse lights you're gonna want to buy them, still dont know how those work just yet
B007MVLCBQ|5|Works really well! Great price for the part!
B00B9H61BK|5|Works great
B00APIRFBE|5|Worked as expected. Direct bolt on for Eton 50.
B00B7C6374|5|cool t shirt, thank you
B0040505GK|5|Ordered these for my van which sits a lot, perfect fit, well made.
B00H1IBKIK|4|Easy to put on my wheels. After a few weeks i noticed I only had 19 left. The one that fell off could have been just not tightened enough. I don't know.
B000AA4RWM|5|Placed these in my RV to make sure it's sitting level.  They work great.
B00K5TXCM4|1|Didn't fit, shipped to me warped. I had to pay $10 return shipping, do not buy.
B004AHOBBS|5|bought another brand that was a few $$ cheaper and quickly returned it to re-order a wix. great quality all around - priced way under oem and performance is great.
B00WMK6Z46|5|Would love to have gotten them but I didn't ... I love them and they are very useful !!!
B00D9C2CDO|2|Some items still got damp in a hard rain storm but all in all everything was good
B000A0CAJE|5|Fit in 2013 Toyota Highlander.
B00TG8Y0OY|2|Price is good I guess I had a lot of issues trying to shrink it to fit my back window , it isn't a very think film and once installed it does the job but for me it didn't work so well
B00BJMFSUU|5|Unit was as ordered an OEM center cap.
B00CEXK402|3|Fit perfectly, but not as snug as I would like so when I turn the key in the ignition the slip moves.
B005SEJTUA|5|quality product
B006GZHESO|3|Okay mirrors for the money.
B007055FLW|3|I put in the mount, they had to use the old top peice because the new one would not fit, didn't bother me because the old one was still good .I read the reviews and knew it may have been a problem but it was so much cheaper them Ome part decided to take a chance. The paint came chipped off. But it works like the car is new. I have only had it for about 3 weeks so I really cannot comment on the longevity of the quality of the part. Will monitor the part
B007TY06JA|5|product worked perfect.
B00BYH6C1E|5|This is the best invention ever!  Open the box, slip the gap filler over the seat belt connector, position it between your seat and the console.  That's it.  Now, you are in business, as they say!  NOTHING will fall between your seat and the console -- crumbs, change, pens, whatever you carry in your front console/driver/passenger area remains above the fray.  I spent years trying to dig out everything under the sun and this wonderful product solved that for me.  I am thinking this is a great gift for everyone I know.  $19.99 makes it affordable!  I really love Drop Stop ever since I saw it on Shark Tank!  Best ever; thank you!!!!
B000CIZYOC|5|easy to install and works as it should
B0009IQZ2K|4|Good product, lasts a long time too, it's showing some wear and tear but I've been using it heavy duty for about 6 months now.
B000786JRI|4|Thank you.
B00COYNZJ8|3|Loved it when it arrived but like others said, the picture started flaking off within a year.  You'd think that they would use a more UV resistant material for something that's going to be in the sun all of the time.<br /><br />This is no more than a novelty and unless you want to keep buying new shades every year I don't recommend it.
B0006IX7Y2|4|works great
B00OBQU6HQ|5|Cover the bow tie completely and fit perfectly.
B006LO4L6I|3|didn't last long on a charge ...disappointed
B004THAO2E|5|Beautiful!  And a wonderful message!  Bright, vibrant colors.  A lovely addition to the back of my car!
B0085XH58O|2|White portion can best be described as light yellow or dingy. Not at all a bright white as expected (or like the front). Disappointed. I will have to replace.
B0009IK7YC|5|direct OEM replacement
B00075XCJE|4|Good directions good fit except it hangs down from bumper about 1 1/2 -2 inches wished it was closer to bumper but good quality
B00HE7SJ7S|4|Purchased these for my 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited DRL replacement.  I like them because they are more white in color then the OEM yellow tint dull ones.  I had trouble with one but just flipped it and it lit right up.  They seem to be very good quality and I would probably buy them again.  I only give it 4 out of 5 stars because of the price.  A set of these should be 22 bucks not 30 to 35!
B003N9LTSM|5|this is truly a must have product for any and all VW people.  I'm received so many compliments on how cool this is.  I'm going to order another one for my son.
B00B1GBYQ6|5|good
B008RMP8B4|5|High quality. Lasts through the worst weather
B003L7T57S|5|Performed to my total satisfaction .......
B00JA0BMV2|1|Not good it sticks to the wrong side of the transfer paper. It bubbles and folds. Seams it was cut wrong a lot of string stray pieces.
B005C5DT5G|5|AAA++++
B010G2TI40|5|Just wanted i wanted.  Even better it was buy one, get one free.  Awesome.  Thanks
B00144BF9Q|5|Easy to install. Works great
B00GUGRSQW|5|Fixed my 2004.5 duramax 2500hd door latch sensor problem.  My alarm would go off in the middle of the night and I kept getting driver door ajar warning while driving.  Haven't had any issues since I installed the new latch assembly. Dorman lists an aftermarket version of this part for about 70 bucks however I was unable to find anyone who sells it...
B007HRKC3E|5|16 minutes after this arrived, I was hooked up to my gooseneck and ready to roll! Perfect fit, perfect solution!!
B00O7UG1JS|5|These look great on our 500 and installed very well.
B000CO7QLK|4|works fine
B00HMGCJSQ|4|I drive a 2007 Subary Legacy Outback wagon.  I never could prove this was the right strut mount, but it is, or at least it looks identical and it fits, hence the 4 stars for zero documentation.The front strut rotates on a bearing in this mount, so I'd replace it if you are crazy enough to do the front strut yourself, though the one I took out looked and functioned fine.  I will never do this job again, and from what I hear about KYB, I won't have to do it again.
B0007TQWKQ|4|Worked well, easy to get to the right color and east to use
B00H7LPKKU|5|This is the geatest gadget since sliced white bread.  I have several farm implements with dozens of grease fittings.  Quie a few are a challenge to run grease through.  As I have used this coupler the last few days, if I can access the fitting with this coupler it functions flawlessly and with ease.  Great product!!
B00TAD5IFK|5|This item is exactly as shown, and fits perfectly. I like this purchase.
B00ONDM07G|5|Works great! Even holds bigger phones like the note 4.
B002HXXNE8|5|Installed in 3 minutes
B008ECDF8A|5|It was great.. Thanks
B0039LDF4A|5|Holy heck it worked.
B00KNWBUTK|5|Exactly what I needed and $300 cheaper than the cheapest shop
B000HBNV9E|5|This is excellent stuff. I sprayed this on my transaxle pan gasket when I was replacing my transaxle filter, cleaning the pan and replacing the pan gasket. I sprayed 3 thin coats on, letting each coat sit for about 1 minute before spraying on the next. It worked perfect, the gasket was very sticky and held in place fine when I laid it down on the pan and lined up the bolt holes. Highly recommended. Permatex makes some great automotive products.
B002NUABUO|5|Great product. Would purchase again.
B004YP227Q|5|fit the Rockler filter perfectly
B0054S5LKM|5|Accurate and easy to adjust pressure
B000786JRI|1|The whole thing broke. The plastic anchor support for the arm strap literally broke as I picked it up and from a distance of 6 inches off the ground the hole front broke off, snapping some of the wires so it could not just be snapped back on.<br /><br />I had purchased this from Amazon based on the better reviews that it had received. I was planning a road trip and I would need to keep my insulin as cool as possible while in the car during the summer. I purchased it more than 30 days in advance so I cannot return it.<br /><br /> It lasted through 3 days of use and it did not cool anything. Items would have to go in cold and then they would remain cool. Anything placed in at room temperature would not cool to anything but possibly 10 degrees below ambient temperature and definitely not the 30+ degrees advertised. During the three days it did work it barely kept my insulin at safe levels. I quickly discovered to keep the insulin safe I had to put in next to frozen food or drinks. After it broke I was left using it the same as any other cooler would be used.<br /><br />The description says that you can buy an adapter to use a wall plug. When it came I had tried to take the 12 volt adapter out, but it had a lot of resistance. I had not bought nor needed the wall adapter so I left it alone after that point. When the front broke off I could plainly see why it had resistance, the plug was hot glued into place from the inside of the unit faceplate. There would have been no way to change the adapter without damaging the unit.<br /><br />Save your money and use an insulated cooler
B002X6VXL4|5|Already had to use it once on the road, does all that is asked of it..  A very good product for in the garage or as needed in the field.
B009YRI64C|5|THIS STICKER GETS GREAT FEEDBACK FROM PASSER BYS
B000C7TWL4|5|Excellent very responsible recommend
B001GMZRQ8|5|Works well on compact tractor.
B000G16JA8|3|thank goodnes theyy have alot of hooks they are cheap. other than that the net is pretty good.
B0048J2YKI|5|Product as described. Easy installation, so far so good.
B008F8Q81O|5|Good
B0022XRP3I|5|Very Nice item and good price to boot!
B0009JB7GI|5|allows more outlets in automobile.
B00LC82GZQ|4|Works great was easy to install. Only problem is it don't have a very long range. Still for the price you can't beat it.
B00X6CKUPY|5|Works great
B00FZTUZ8I|5|Fits perfectly and I love it.
B00BHH1QT4|5|Sprays evenly. Very good
B00PLCVMZY|5|Works great to hold tablet on headrest, stroller and car seat.
B00AYXM4DY|5|This product really works! Just make sure to tape up anything you don't want touched because it will leave a mark. If it does make contact, make sure to wipe it away with a wet paper towel. This acts similar to a clear coat and leaves a layer of shine to the surface you are applying it to.
B00W68A716|2|Not what i expected,  the back seat cover dont have holes for the head rest . They dont stay on. The words and floral design is glued on to the seat covers. I thought the design was going to be stitched in. Would not recommend
B00CMU9NGI|5|Very light compared to stock but not sure if it helped performance. Works great with dr pulley sliders.
B000C9SQNW|5|fit well
B00LM026C2|1|I drive a 2011 Hyundai Sonata GLS and I suggest to avoid this part. First off, like others had already said, it's longer than the original starter and the gear is smaller. The size difference made it harder to install and the plastic clip broke off for the ignition switch to plug into. Now the switch will not clip in and seat properly.The only positive thing I can say is it is inexpensive but you get what you pay for; cheap part cheap quality. You are better off spending more money for quality part.
B001AJMOLS|5|They look great!  Added the additional visibility around my travel trailer I needed.  Very happy with these and love that I can easily remove without extra tools when I want them off.<br /><br />Only issue was that they took a bit of muscle to get them to snap on.
B001O7LX6S|5|Better shine than armourall. Smells good too.
B00LWNE5V4|5|complete with rings and the rubber looks oem... not installed yet.
B00842A7F4|5|Good.
B00M5DI1A6|5|Works great.  Easy to install.
B00NXEB4UA|3|Didn't fit my 2005 Infiniti G35X Stock tails. Honestly I wanna give the benefit of any doubt here...the shop of which deals with aftermarket everything...they failed on applying the Vinyles over my lights. They said the bend/divet whatever was to much for the amount of vinyle cut and it ended up super crappy! I was very excited to get this done to my G! Now I've paid for Vinyles.. I paid shop labor only obviously and still have nothin to show for it Lmao. I don't expect anything its just unfortunate that it went the way it did. So that's why I'm giving you a 3 star rating instead of a (0) zero star rating...No full blame on either party. I'm just bummed
B00SS3S54O|4|Exactly as in the picture, fits perfectly!
B000UUMM6K|5|We have other Maxxair Vent Covers and needed another one for a different trailer.  Maxxair makes a great product, does exactly what we need it to do and allows us to leave the vents on the trailers open without worrying about rain getting on the inside.  If needed, we would order this product again.  My husband can install it in less than 10 minutes.
B0006IX7Y2|4|It was nice to have this device to support our sewer hose, but it is a bit of a chore to set up.  My daughter and I spent a good bit of time playing a sort of disgusting little &#34;fix the sewer hose&#34; game...if your hose is lighter and the gap gets just right between the segments of this support, the hose just droops down.  You have to lift it up, adjust the support, and keep going until the thing finally stays put and doesn't let the hose sag anywhere.  Perhaps I'll get better at it as I go...
B00GI2IJTI|5|Coming from my favorite street artist of all time, this just completes my truck. It looks cool, starts up conversations, and when we go out to lunch from school with new people everybody says just meet at the truck with the panda sticker. This is now apart of my truck. I am extremely please.
B008BA97WS|5|Very good stuff and very easy  install and very cheap
B00CO798L4|5|Not bad for the price!!!! Basically the best horsepower increase you can bolt on for the exhaust. I installed them when the engine was out of the car, so it was really easy. I would hate to find out how hard and time consuming it would be to install with the engine in the car. Tight fit.<br />Very noticeable increase in power theoughout the rev range.
B00WXYH3NS|1|Not worthy of the BMW name
B002OUMVWY|1|Leet right off the bat, first time out of the box. This is not a product that you want to have problems with. Will be returning.
B000IYR7HW|5|One month now and still running strong. I tested my old one when my car started overheating when seating at a red light for over 2 min. Problem fixed. I think it makes a little more noise then oem but I don't car because my ac is ice cold again and I always have my windows up anyways.
B00902G49U|5|Replaces OEM.  Comes with both size alternator fuses.
B00K72C1T4|5|Works great, exactly as advertised.
B00V4049K2|5|It does not become smelly after long use.
B0010E00T6|4|This is the correct filter for 2008 Honda.
B007Q8JUVY|5|Hard to install but very satisfied with my purchase as my windshield shall remain impeccable.
B000H8VZ72|5|I put the part in myself and now my car's rear looks good as new. The order arrived that same week and the look and feel is completely identical to my car's original tail light.
B0095S5I3W|5|part fixed the problem, no more check engine light.
B00429NKWK|5|Seriously amazing! I absolutely love this product...takes some time but that's probably why it works.
B00JS205K6|5|The boot adapter delivers what it promises.  Threads on to a Honda shifter and holds the boot nicely.  Good price and fast shipping.
B010W71W2U|5|High quality design. Looks great!
B00SDQQ3HW|5|i was at a stop light and i see people reading the sticker and laughing lol i like it
B00LGIFWV2|2|The product is poorly designed. I bought it as a theft deterrent and when you remove the knob the whole piece comes apart. Maybe it's because the 2 metal pieces just sit in the plastic piece connecting them. I'm going to try to possibly zip tie them together and see how that works. Second problem I found is that the bolt that comes with the unit is not long enough to reach the side post. I would recommend using a different product.
B00LZEGG3A|5|I mounted this light on the front of my riding mower so I could mow at night during this hot weather. It lit up the whole yard! And it doesn't pull the battery down.
B008XO9ATC|5|First gen Volvo S80s (99-06) ran a GM 4t65ev-gt. This kit fits and fixes many of the issues s80 owners complain about (trans shudder, etc.). If you're not rebuilding the transmission out of the vehicle you won't be able to get the side cover off to access the valve body but you can still install the important parts of the kit by dropping the pan and filter.
B00068L1IQ|3|Beautiful product.
B00651C9OI|1|Please do not purchase this antenna for a Tacoma. I have a 2012 and this product simply does not work. Yes it will install and comes with all the hardware but the reception is terrible! I'm not sure how the other review were above a 1 star but take my word for it and don't by this.<br /><br />NB
B00NUE3VJK|4|Looks great on my all black Willys Wrangler. Reception in the valleys dropped off a little, but otherwise works great. It's much beefier and stiffer than the original equipment. Couldn't be any easier to install!
B0010FTXE8|4|Working well will order again
B00BBMDAL2|1|Terrible product stay away broke in 5 mins of using it
B0002Z9R5M|5|fit well!
B0024GQ0WK|4|nice helmet for the cost.  recommend buying a size larger than you might normally wear.
B001RM4SE4|5|As always great plugs
B00AC83LAQ|4|Fits in small space needed for use and storage and pours waste oil easily from corner.
B00QQUG264|3|Not what I wanted
B003CJWHP2|3|Helmet seemed to be of good quality but sizing was all wrong.  Had to return for refund and received as promised.
B00S8JN8TA|4|I've had them in my 2008 mustang for just over a week and no problems so far.
B00K7VE2VK|5|Excellent product.  Works as advertised, for a deep waterless solution to cleaning.
B001QUG17E|5|By far, the best repair manuals for any car. Very detailed information on just about anything. This manual, especially when paired with online videos, will allow anyone with basic mechanical skills and some time become an excellent weekend mechanic!
B00SXEQC66|5|l Love this cover !
B005ETWKIM|5|product as described no problems
B008TXHZ58|5|Good purchase no make that great purchase; it fits and it works. Not inexpensive but the safety and convenience tradeoff is worth it especially in urban riding. My 2008 Majesty is pleased and so am I.
B0033D0P4W|3|The listed dimensions are not accurate. The artwork is very nice, but it is smaller than what is advertised.
B000FW6278|5|Better than expected, easy insatll..
B003ZQYB5G|5|second one I ordered, these are just the best in protection , covers the bumpers
B004BWU8AA|5|love it
B00C2NRQUK|5|Used on a couple trucks never had issues used to fit  5.9l 360 ram 1500 4x4
B003EOZH9S|5|You can not beat this product for the price!  I wanted the &#34;beefy&#34; look for my Jeep, meaning I wanted my tires to stick out a little beyond my fenders, and this product gave me that look!  I figured installation would be easy, but they were more difficult to install than my bumpers.  Granted, it's not Smittybilt's fault that Jeep made their fender-wells a pain.  Long story short, I could not use a few of the rear washers on the front fenders, due to there not being enough room between the rear of the bolt and the fender.  I was barely able to get the lock-nut on, due to you only have about an inch to work with.  Maybe with a little more patience and mechanical experience, I might have been able to.  But oh well.  They look good and seem tough!  The rear tires barely stick out past the fender, but the front definitely does!  I have LT265/70R17 tires.
B00PF0HIHS|5|Installation took 5 minutes and the lights are SO much brighter!
B004HYRIK0|4|Well made, pain in the ass to install. U have one shot to install. First one I installed went perfect, installing the other side caused me to curse the product out! Suggest you have two people to install. Note: tailgate piece is not included!
B00D1HHFSO|1|Got it and it was tore up and looked like it was used. Had scuff marks on the red also. Do not buy it
B000EVYGZA|5|Love it!
B000HBM3S4|5|Very large quanity. More than you  will probably use.  Dries very quickly, work fast.
B006E4SKQ2|5|Love my cover
B003CUHXD2|5|Hearing protection required, this baby blows..Water can not hide. A must for any bike with a exposed engine. No need to use the compressor anymore to blow of hand tools or gear, this does it all. I even use to blow dust off ceiling fans and shop fans.
B000C83POI|4|worked really well
B000C2AO66|3|The expected product is very good quality , but what was the shipping and handling was the worst 21 pounds a box volume to two simple gaskets . I came out expensive transfer to my country. Keep in mind that you can send in smaller box, the much you strain can also protect the article
B001DCN1OG|5|Perfect replacement on my 07 accord v6
B005ZWM0R4|1|Absolutely the biggest piece of junk ever produced! Would not connect to vehicle after several attempts another scan tool was plugged in without any difficulty. A complete waste of time and money.
B00YY7M4AO|5|So far very pleased with, I'm using in a 07 chevy cobalt & I've compared the dash with the scanner & there's no lag @ all. The tac moves its right on point with. When the temp goes up it goes up right along with it, not even a second later. The only negative i have is when trying to diagnose the check engine light it brings you to all data & you have to pay for a subscription to diagnose the problem, wish there was other options. Thats not a gear problem though so this product gets 5+ stars, better than any other scanner under $100 that I've used.
B004J88BE6|5|WORKED PERFECTLY ON MY VEHICLE. NO PROBLEMS.
B00DBESE64|2|one arrived innoperable.
B0098B4RUQ|5|Fast delivery.  Great product
B000AMXQDG|5|Shines well.  love meguiar's products.
B00U7A8HHQ|1|Is just plastic .. and is not what I  want
B000E28ELG|4|My humblest apologies for stating the hardware was not included!  I found it inside the receiver (duh - guess I should have TOTALLY unnwrapped everything before I sent of the email.
B00JKTDS9W|3|Fair
B00QHLE3RC|5|Uncommon breed.  My mother was delightfully surprised that I'd found it.
B00EKMXIFI|2|Good lights but Half of the lights I bought did not work
B00XNN6IDE|1|If I could give this thing 0 stars I would I wouldn't buy this thing if it was only 20 bucks first it's not scratch or Crack resistant never the less it is the flimsiest windshield ever I wouldn't recommend this Windshield to anyone
B00VLNAOMY|5|Coating was amazing. Just what I needed.
B004V753SW|5|nice product.
B00NWF61GC|5|As described, OEM quality. Printed the directions for programming the new remote, and got it done in minutes. A bit pricey for a hunk of plastic with a battery, but perfect for my needs.
B000C13R2A|5|Right fit. Arrived on time.
B000FQ7KK2|1|Pads are nonsense. Started wearing out after about six months. OEM pads lasted at least that many years.
B009AJL470|3|ok
B000CFHDKI|5|Worked great. Fit perfectly.
B00XILJWKW|5|as a describe
B00E0IUVN4|5|Good product,  thank you
B00FRHOJYE|1|Only lasted 3 months before streaking began, which is ridiculous. Blades did not entirely touch the windshield at their extremeties for some reason. These is no way I am going to buy these again. I'm contacting Amazon to see if I can get a refund.
B004O5IDHE|5|It was JUST what I was looking for.  One of the &#34;wings&#34; comes off completely. You can carry 1, 2, 3, or 4 bikes. easy to put together. Easy to load and unload the bikes. a good solid base 2&#34; bar.  Couldn't get much better. Priced just right.
B000WJC9T4|5|Very nice good fit
B0011O0Y32|4|Great Mat! quick and easy to use.
B00JEUHPO6|5|Just like factory, no complaints except with the car was that room the original off
B00S0YVK52|2|It broke after it was put in but they did give me a refund
B004RT2CT2|5|Comfortable,  light and stylish helmet.  Fit just like it should.  Enough padding for comfort.
B00L237SUO|4|Works as promised.
B0049MX77S|5|easy to install
B004RFKBEO|5|I have only used the carrier twice, but I'm happy with it so far.  Using on a 2015 Honda Pilot along with the StowAway Hitch tightener.  This is a well made rack that I expect to get a lot of use out of.  Reading other reviews helped me know what to expect.
B000FKKOK6|5|Sounds great, but not by itself. Get the Fiamm 72112 for that American made 1960's land yacht sound.
B00H1EWAF6|5|Just got my car sticker...I am excited to get it on my car!  It was just as expected...good quality and expected size.
B005F6VWQK|5|worked as expected, good product
B00Y4G7WIE|5|My kids love it and it does its job.
B00FYXJDA6|5|Doesn't fit large SUV
B001G6QCJK|5|Seem to be working great. No more intermittent blinkers.
B00WM36XNG|5|I have found a lot more use for this bag than I expected. I planned to just use it as a trash bag. Well, a couple days after I got it I decided to go on a day trip. I was surprised at how the bag is more like a insulated lunch box than a trash can. This made it perfect to stick some sandwiches and sodas and waters and snacks inside. I really like its shape and size. It's definitely a high-quality product. I'm going to set it up in my car again soon so that I can use it as a convenient trash bag. I received it at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and I think it's worth it!
B00A8OO7N4|3|works good
B0042B7XWQ|5|Have ordered many heat shield sun screens for various cars.  Always a perfect fit.  Can be a pain rolling up each time so normally I folder in half and half again and toss in the back.  Best sun screens I have found to date but certainly not cheap.
B001KSAB5A|3|the mirror fit but they put a padded foam piece glue to the middle of the mirror so if you need the passenger side it has a foam pad in the middle and we had to scrape it off. which is not easy to do. the foam piece should be placed unattached so it can be used on either side.
B0067UD0NG|4|I would give it 5 stars if my cruise control worked after installing them. They are good for people on a budget who need a bearing to get them by for a while. I would use a higher quality bearing if i had to install them again. Others may have a different experience, but they have been good for the few months they have been installed.
B006FUT05U|5|easy application, keeps car looking clean longer.
B00MXBZCUC|5|They work great when strapping down your bike as covers fro the straps to protect your HD Bike.
B0088COX4G|4|Mirrors work great but passenger side square mirror has a distorted view. Makes vehicles look tall and narrow
B00CRIN37K|5|fits good
B000EDQQD8|5|Our state parks tend to have high water pressure, this showed me the current system pressure and held the pressure to my RV at a nice, safe level.  Must have for your fresh water supply!
B00A66GYDA|5|Work's great!!!
B00HR26U0S|4|It's cheap and easy to install. It gives more of a blue'ish light, rather than white-white LED, OR it could just be me. Overall, great item
B00CTVN3DY|1|I bought this sunshade about a month ago.  It is now almost entirely faded, which isn't that big of a deal.  I know that the hot Texas sun can fade these pretty quickly.  My main problem (which caused me to throw it away already) was that the black parts around the edges has begun to come off, so I have small pieces of black sunshade all over my car.  I didn't want this to continue, so I had to throw it away.  I'm extremely disappointed in the product.
B0056DY6XI|2|received as described. drivers side was bent. I will make do with what I have
B00UX5WRBM|5|Amazing bright led lights... I had an extra led lights before this, but now not longer needed, but still look great my motorcycle with them.
B002AN02R6|1|Very low quality. Just go with the $16 covers because  they can't  be any lower quality. Waste of money. Fake leather is so thin it will likely  break down or tear very  easily.
B009D3I09S|1|High quality product, but it did not fit my '96 XR400R as listed, the roller was too wide and would not clear the frame.
B0074ZL83C|5|I've used these grips in the past and they are comfortable and easy to install. Be sure to use handgrip glue for best results, not soapy water.
B004SBW4HY|5|Excellent in every way.  Great price, perfect replacement, timely shipping.  Very, very pleased.
B003NBFMMY|5|I purchase this cargo bag for our trip to VA Beach.  We received the cargo bag one day earlier than expected which is always unexpected in a good way.  I wasn't expecting the bag to be as big as it was, my cargo carrier is 53&quot; wide and the bag was 54&quot; not a big issues, but as we were loading the bag, I was able to load two full size luggage on the bottom,  two travel size cases and two soft travel bags with other soft items on top.  It didn't rain on our trip but looking by the construction, I was not worried that our luggage would get wet.<br />The only thing you have to look out for is the location of your exhaust pipe, our Subaru Forester pipe vented directly to one corner of the bag, after driving seven hours, the corner of the bag started to melt, but that's the not the bags's fault.  I would look at the exhaust pipe of your vehicle and if needed get a 90 pipe end to redirect the exhaust.<br />When we returned from our trip, my neighbor borrowed our bag and he text me it did great for him.
B007QVB71C|5|good tool. removed a large hydraulic filter that I had dented using another strap wrench.
B006VODVQ4|5|Great product.  Fits awesome!!!
B00AESICJO|4|Would have prefered a choice of hearts but it looks great on my car.
B000C122UI|5|I am satisfied with the product
B001CF4UWG|5|Great price! Love it!
B000C48YXO|1|I purchased this pump and had my mechanic install it. It doesn't work - didn't get any details from the shop (certified BMW shop, they typically don't let customers bring their own parts but he made an exception for me so I could save some money), but the power assist cuts in and out. Very frustrating, since I'll have to buy another pump and probably do the replacement myself in the garage.
B004XJ3R7C|5|fits perfectly
B00Y9J5P6M|5|Perfect fit, easy installation, looks great
B00XWTAPFG|5|Nice to have a magnetic stick that will not ruin the bumper
B0009VKLOK|5|fit well!
B000TSGP9S|5|WORKS GREAT  I AM REMINDED EVERY TIME THE PHONE RINGS
B007KA7PP6|5|EXCELLENT.
B00WOT3YM6|3|The flashing light was not working. Had to return it.
B00O170ATE|4|Very handy
B009IF3KFK|5|Love Mobil 1
B005EPLJ9W|5|Fit my grandsons VW perfectly
B000LG9AXQ|5|I'm very happy with my product. Thx!
B0060DZTFM|5|After two years of dragging my feet on purchasing this filter for my child's atv ( Polaris Outlaw 90) I decided it was time after noticing his filter starting to crumble. Since adding the UNI filter we have noticed that the bike breathes much better, and has a snappier throttle response.
B001J8Q1QE|5|These floor mats are outstanding. This is the second set I've bought and I love them. They're heavy duty, thick rubber, and look good in the car. This is and original BMW item, just less expensive.
B001DCF6KI|5|Made raising the hood of my car as good as new.
B007QBSY4K|1|Ordered for my 1966 Chevy Truck, which requires a three terminal solenoid.  The pictures show three terminals on the solenoid.  The one I received only has two terminals.
B0049QIX5U|1|Shaped exactly the same as my old with one exception, the vent tube is 3/8 larger in diameter!
B00J3NPOM4|1|Very poor quality, wouldn't recommend...
B00JLJO9WQ|4|The first one received would stop working if the fan was set lower than setting 4 out of 6. It wouldn't turn on again until the car was restarted. However, the replacement process was smooth and the second one is still working flawlessly two months later. This was for a '04 Pacifica with ATC.
B000C2UJQQ|5|Perfect fit for my 2006 Pontiac GTO. Had a awful whine coming from either the AC belt or AC pulley after doing some radiator work (belts and pulleys got wet). Replaced the AC belt and both pulleys and its back to normal.
B000C7QC4O|5|Excellent product, made entirely of aluminum. Have purchased 2 other aluminum condenser for my jeep and one lasted 3 years and the other 4 years. The problem was the mounting bracelets were made of steel and the contenders corroded from electrolysis where it contacted the steel mounts.
B00T0TZ2FA|5|For the I LOVE PINK sticker. I really like it a lot. Its a good thick sticker as well. I recommend this!!
B0072RZGLW|4|They work OK , not a 100% perfect fit, just a bit of space on some sides. They are a lot thinner than what they look like on the TV commercial. Not so high an edge as seen on TV to keep spills in. So far they have done a very good job keeping my floors clean though.
B00JKHOQ6I|5|I purchased this optical pickup to replace one in a cheap aftermarket distributor that the previous owner installed just a few months earlier. This pickup has worked flawlessly and the engine starts immediately every time now. No codes either! Thanks for producing such a high quality product at a reasonable price!
B00GI78D76|5|Bright lights. Definitely the big center light is really bright. Worth the money.
B00NHZ7L7U|5|They serve their purpose and look cool. Havent had them on long (only a day or so) so I cant tell much for long haul. They were a tad bit difficult to instal with the parts being so small - but that was it.
B000FW61Z6|4|It looked used but if you look closely, so dies the picture. The bristles were all over the place. It's effective.
B009S2ZPTC|5|It took me a while to find a solid handle to replace the sub-par plastic oem ones. This is a great product for anyone that likes the things they fix to stay fixed. I replaced my driver side with one of these a year ago and finally got around to replacing the passenger. No complaints whatsoever, i find it has even made the door much easier to open (compared to plastic handle).
B00VXFKGE6|5|Love all the settings great for washing the dog and watering the plants!
B00514ABY0|5|Very Nice item and good price to boot not to mention looks good and keeps heat off you
B009DIWO2M|5|Execellent product re useable perfect fit
B00ITJQT2M|5|Thx
B001GN1K18|5|Plugged right in 05 excursion.
B0015PMQDI|5|I really wish I had used this stuff years ago.  I tried this stuff on a black Suburban and it didn't swirl the paint at all!  Excellent product.
B005KLS6MS|4|104 degrees in Louisiana right now. This vest makes a noticeable difference while on my motorcycle.
B005PZMKZI|4|Got my order in today and it matches the inside of my car perfectly! Also fits well on my seats! Great product for a great price!
B00QUOQ5DG|5|this mit will make the rickey bobby dodge shine up in the vegas sun, any soap is approved by rickey bobby race team.
B0050Z9LD2|5|Installed on an 07 Avalanche LT and installed in like 15 minutes. Quick and easy, everything was bright and worked but The next day my passenger ballast went out so I emailed Kensun and they had great customer service and shipped me another ballast right away and now they work great, i used the Anti flicker harness with the 55watt on my fogs and low beams . Super bright And very warm!
B001TCWL1E|4|My purchase was a slightly used one, but proved to be well worth the expense.  GTC has engineered a truly fabulous precision instrument in this clamp meter capable of accurate measurements down to 1 mA, in either the AC or DC mode.  An automatic zero feature keeps the jaws calibrated even when the currents being measured are minuscule.  Construction is solid and convincing to the user.  A storage pouch and a set of test leads are included.  Measurement of parasitic currents are easily made with this AC/DC clamp meter.  That was my primary reason for making this purchase.  Of course, resistance and voltage measurements are also possible, but the instrument is touted for its low level current measurements.
B00PQNZILM|5|Awesome
B000WJX6IM|5|This stuff works awesome and if used correctly doesn't harm the engines paint finish. I first discovered it when I purchased it at a local motorcycle shop but it works good on car engines too. Just be sure not to apply it to a hot or warm engine and be sure to rinse it off well or spotting/discoloration can occur. It will not cut through the thick stuff unless you use a brush and scrub a little. If you're using it on thick stuff it will take a couple applications.  If you want a product that will get the thick stuff without some scrubbing this is not it.
B007A3VGIK|3|I only give it 3 stars because it did not fit my Kawasaki Mule 1000.  It said it would but it didn't.  I need to return this starter.
B0040CTUAA|2|Did not even receive package at front door , ended up at neighbors house. Luckily they were nice enough to bring it to me , cheap material by the way
B00XXBMQPK|1|Installed on my motorcycle - 12V outlet appears fine, however the USB charger insert let out smoke on first use.<br />Wires provided should be larger gauge as well, there is not much conductor.
B0084UIZNM|5|Great floor mats. Fit my truck perfectly and constructed from a nice material.  Easy to clean and protects my carpet from everything. The laser cut technology allowed the mats to mold to the contour of the floor giving it a seamless look.
B000CAZ0IK|5|great
B00WOT3YM6|5|The best tire inflator I ever owned.  Does the job great.
B0002UHVAA|4|Ok product but there are other systems that seem to work better for me.
B001NAP344|2|Definitely increases air flow but at the expense of letting in more dirt/debris. Engine sound has more 'grunt' which is nice but now the engine RPM idles differently (i.e. higher) than with stock filter. If you also want an aftermarket exhaust you will need a remapping for sure.  Just make sure you do the research before buying to find out if this really fits your needs and is worth it to you.<br /><br />Side note, if anyone wants to buy a used one with less than 50 miles on it....
B001Y8NF90|5|Good to have,  keep eyes on straps
B00FPKZ04G|4|i have used these slides before and liked them fine. the only thing missing are the install instructions
B00BNIOH84|2|Lasted 2 summers.  Purchase a metal one.  You won't be disappointed.
B00KTL5PPU|5|VERY GOOD TOO
B004QEF970|5|Perfect fit; great price
B009YR00MI|5|I owned the older model and loved it and this one is just as great. Charged it up and it ran my full sized house fan for three hours on medium speed. At first I was disappointing because I thought they took out the solar panel charging capabilities but upon further research I found out that it uses the 12V DC slot for solar charging. The only thing this thing is lacking is a radio for emergencies.
B004FKWZL8|5|perfect
B009PIOEBO|5|Fits good as expected.
B00HVHN0D4|5|Cover fit perfectly.
B00C0Z2L0K|5|Installed in my 2006 Subaru Outback wagon. Much quieter now. Helps reduce my loud exhaust at highway speed.  75sqft is a lot. I didn't even use half of it.
B00WXGQHLA|5|good quality with good sticking back
B00503PPU2|4|good tool
B00USC2CI8|5|I mounted this on a 30 year old 4 wheeler to replace the old broken headlight housing that is no longer available. This thing is bright! lights up everything. I'm thinking of putting a smaller one on my large zero turn mower for those evenings I run late mowing. Great value!
B000A3DUO0|5|Total Badass...I Love It A LOT ...It's The Beast 2.0 I got in on my Buick LaCrosse it's luxury car,  but I don't care...it's stays
B00348KSMK|5|Alien Green Kia Soul.... ok I fell for the dancing hamsters...<br />Day glow smiley face antenna ball...<br />and a peace dove on the trunk lid...<br />ANYTHING, to easy the rage of the road....<br />I vote yes!
B00TQ07IOQ|5|very nice,really good price.
B00CADT4ZC|5|ordered this decal in red. Seller was quick to contact me and shipped fast. Color is on point and the vinyl appears to be high quality, should hold up well on my car. Would order from again.
B00XQ905C0|5|Mirrors arrived very fast. Was easy and a direct fit for my bike. Mirrors work great and look even better!
B010PLBIFE|1|This charger did not work at all coming directly out of the box. I'm very disappointed and will be returning it.
B009FNX2EO|5|Great addition to any truck. It was easy to install, and did wonders for passengers and myself getting in and out of the truck.<br /><br />Money well spent and it is sturdy with no movement when stepping on or off it.
B003Z49L2G|5|bought for grandson for part of a costume. fits big as they are for an adult, but it's just for play.
B00KWJ7K8E|5|I had to replace my 2004 4Runner remove as the top of the remove cover was worn out. I bought this replacement cover and put my old remote electronics in the new cover and it worked great! I would highly recommend it. It is certainly much cheaper than getting a new remove at the dealer.
B00IR14RQM|5|Awesome
B00HCSBQ7Y|1|Buy it and regret it !!!
B004A69VBY|4|need to read description more carefully. thank you very much for the item.

B002OTSAOI|1|Didn't fit my 09 silverado ended up throwing them away and hydro coating my emblems
B004QCCJ2U|4|Was as expected.<br />No issues.
B00PV3ESZO|5|Fit perfectly on my 2005 Cadillac Deville. Car is is much better condition now that I have replaced the motor mounts.
B00829L1ZE|5|Fits my 2008 A4 Sedan with the phone cradle in the console perfectly.
B007V2EACO|5|Very nice fit and very solid.  Easy to install
B001GJ3FIS|1|It fell apart not long after I started using it.
B00DNKW0RA|3|They are a lot smaller than I anticipated. :(
B001MOVK9S|5|Pretty dang good. Definitely recommend!
B002MQFTLU|5|Excellent replacement fit. Great service.
B011C8P4K4|5|just what i've been looking for
B00IGEMBP4|5|I love them there great
B0009H51WQ|4|Worked as advertised.
B002G1PC4U|4|works fine
B001U2DPUE|4|This booster antenna did appreciably improve my digital TV reception-- nothing miraculous, but definitely an improvement. Shipment was quick and the antenna arrived in perfect condition.
B003E2QTBK|5|It's 49ers, what more is there to say!
B00EI6CKVE|5|Awesome!
B00144D77E|4|👍
B001BNAPNW|5|Great
B00V7Z4WV0|5|Perfect fit, exact size as OEM, arrived fully charged, fast shipping, very good price. Highly recommended.
B0016IJ3Z8|2|Did not work out of the box. Had to take it apart and realign the gears.
B00KJGPQE0|5|Great product!
B000W0OFXG|5|I love not having to carry keys and the ability to set all locks to the same combination.
B000GAQ2O2|5|Ancra tiedowns are the gold standard.  They are heavier than other tiedowns, and from over 20+ years of using these and some other cheaper ones, I have all but thrown away the others and use Ancra only now.
B00K6BRC9U|5|Awesome winch cable
B00DBEM6U4|2|made my blinkers too fast.
B005IGTVHY|5|Step worked out great! it does take some extensive work to install however. probably designed to be put on when being built, not after the fact. But, worth the effort.
B00JXS3BXI|4|I have only used this winch once so far but I am happy with it. put it on a receiver mount on my car trailer. the clutch lever could be longer for more leverage but I like the brake to keep the cable from bird nesting while freespooling. I wondered about the higher gear ratio compared to other winches I have looked at but it was fast winching my pickup on. it was not a heavy load due to no engine or trans but it was a crew cab 4wd. I could use a snatch block if needed for heavier loads.
B000B68V9K|4|PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED
B009EA9PPI|5|Fit my 2009 Tahoe perfectly. Good quality purchase. I will definitely use this brand again.
B00RCA2EX2|2|Does not stick well to the vehicle looks great though
B00514A2LM|5|The bolt covers are of good quality they install easy and quick. Good service and fast shipping
B00W6WVFPE|5|Works great.
B00ELHNM3K|5|Great oil
B000F5LJ7S|5|Perfect tool for the job.  Made the task easier and shorter in duration.
B005MREXB8|3|I bought a Lamin-x set for my Infiniti M45.  The instructions were well thought out and easy to put into practice.  Unfortunately the Lamin-x film has receded about 3mm so far.  In only 7 months it has left a kind of glue scum around where it used to be.  I live in a fairly stable environment and the car is garaged regularly.  Equally we do not get any snow.  I think the technology has to be improved, especially at this price.
B00IIVUXLO|3|Did not fit my 2015 Ford Escape as advertised
B000BSY8XQ|5|Nice bolts up in minutes built strong
B000Y82UXI|5|Solid hardware. Very nice finish. I have no way of commenting on durability only time will tell. But I have no reason to doubt it will hold up well. I ordered the 1 inch version to replace a broken rail base. Fiitment was very good and set screws held very solid. The picture showed it had only one set screw but the one I received was taller than pictured with two set screws which was a welcomed deviation from the description.
B00OJB0DE4|5|They fitted great and look good<br />easy to install
B00480J4I2|5|perfect
B00SLGZHTO|5|This jet drill set is well worth the money.
B00BYGM6YC|3|Not bad for plastic covers
B004A0RBSK|5|Fit my wife's 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 3.6L V6 just fine.
B001AIZ5HY|5|My headlights look brand new just spend a lot of time on the sanding steps and they'll come out great.
B00TK2WEP8|5|Perfect!  Sticks REALLY well to a window- great purchase!
B003SZK05E|5|As always Eagle Eye has the best pattern of them all. They may be a little brittle but the beam output is next to none.
B00XVVED6C|3|Rizoma knock offs. They say Rizoma on them but quality is a bit less than expected. For the price I'm sure the will work ok. As usual, you get what you pay for.------update.installed these lights. For what they cost, the light seems pretty good. Brighter than my last inexpensive turn signals. For the price I would buy them again.
B0039O1UWQ|3|Item arrived with damage to one of the brackets that hold the wind faring on. Installed on my truck easy however overnight we had rain and already the hardware used to put the track together is rusting. At the recommendation of another reviewer I was going to spray it with bed liner guess that will be done sooner rather than later.
B00ANQ5BF0|5|Great!
B00BI3SD7A|5|The gook on my rear tire was a badly cooking battery, not the wheel bearings. Never opened the box.
B00K326GT4|4|Well built, great price but no instructions.
B004PXAUGC|5|ok
B00ICV9NBG|5|Nice finishing touch.
B00O9VFLRS|5|Sikaflex works well in almost all applications.  I used this in an emergency boiler repair and it has lasted three weeks so far.
B00REJXFM0|5|Looks great, fits great, quality is top-notch too!
B00FM6V1S2|5|For the money it works great
B000K005Z0|4|This is the only speaker that fits my truck.  I have replaced both sides now and have been well pleased with these speakers.
B00KTHYAUU|5|excellent !
B000C2WL8K|5|Perfect fit for my cherokee laredo 1998 4.0L. I bought it because I already have an identical belt and it works perfectly for years, now I have my old belt as spare in my cherokee, that belt never broke or show any damage on it.
B000CLQHAO|4|Good but not great. A year later, seems to make some slight noise from time to time.
B00FYXJCAC|5|awesome
B0023WCS0S|5|Love them better on my TL and hope they last an don't start blinking like the originals
B00LLNWT36|5|Well made product. Clean look, no dents or scratches. It was in a good packaging and arrived on time. In the state I live in it is Okay not to have the front plate installed, so I purchased only one of these. It does fit great on my car and accommodates the state's size license plate perfectly. The caps are a little bit too bigger for the screws I use, but this is not a reason to give less stars, rather it is something I can do about. I do not know how it looks from behind at night... but this is nothing I care about.
B000GVCW5E|5|Great product
B005FK81A6|4|Put these on my 05 Civic. I have been having a problem of my rotor warping and I figured I would give these a try. Installation was the same as all Honda brakes. This kit did come with some brake grease and plenty of different size clips. So far I have put a little over 100 miles on them and they are working fine.
B006AVJPE0|5|Great shipping and great fit for my female face :)
B00JIIZCM6|5|Makes the leather furniture look like new!
B0006HPA02|5|Great product...great seller....no issues
B004TC1KJK|1|Broke within 3 months leaving me with a 200 dollar tow bill.
B00M37WXMQ|5|I received my clutch in a timely manner. It came with copper washers and banjo bolts. It was a direct replacement to my factory piece and installation was a breeze. The feel and effort to squeeze the clutch lever are both improved. Feels like I don't need to squeeze as much to get a response. I would definitely recommend this product due to the aesthetics and functionality.
B001EWM0UQ|2|crap
B007OSL3DY|4|This seems like a fairly well made product. I mounted it on my Ford Two-Fitty. At first I had my doubts, especially the way it wobble around between the bed and tailgate. It just seems like, with some effort, the tailgate could still be removed. Like any security measure, it just make it a little more difficult to steal.
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Received my new revised version and love it. My kids now throw their garbage in the trash bag instead of the floor and having tissues handy is a life saver and don't have to worry about the box and tissues getting all ripped up since I would keep it under the car seat.
B004YJTW7K|5|Perfect fit on my 2000 tundra
B00NPM37U0|4|This Head Unit is awesome if it were reliable. I purchased it for $379.00 in Nov 2015. Within 8 months the operation system began to freeze up and required a manual reset with the reset button every now and then. Now it's happening EVERY time I drive making it irritating and somewhat dangerous to constantly take my eyes off the road to find the very small reset button which is no longer fixing the freezing issue. As of today 11 Aug 2015, the company said they would honor their 18 month warranty, however I have to pay to ship the unit to China, and if I'm lucky I will get the unit back in a month! Also according to Autopumkin this unit is not being produced anymore so if you have any issues you will have to send it back for repairs as they have instructed me to do.  Update: Since this post was written the company has contacted me and agreed to reimburse me for the shipping back to China in order to make repairs. So far there customer service has been in constant contact in an effort to do what is right. I'm still waiting on the status of my repair and will update when I receive my unit.  Update: I have since installed my unit and have not had any issues what so ever with it's performance. I have been refunded for my shipping expenses and received the unit with multiple inspection stickers and new wrapping around the whole unit. I no longer have any feed back in my speakers, the unit does not freeze, and everything seems to be working very well. I'm glad that the company stood by their product and did what was right for the customer. It's apparent to me that I must have received a dysfunctional unit from the beginning with how well it's functioning now. Thank you AutoPumkin for repairing my nav unit and standing by your word.
B0002JMF98|5|was exactly what I needed to hook gauges to vacuum pump
B00O7XYRQO|5|nice .
B002R0YOMG|5|Perfect fit!
B010CA65P6|3|They didn't fit my car
B000C9SJUC|5|Fast delivery and as described, thanks.
B007XL7TB2|5|Exact fit to 2002 ES, comes with a plastic tray.
B002E29M1K|3|Works
B00XO41IDM|5|It looks so cute on my Subaru.
B000C2YCBY|4|I've always like Gates belts.
B00IWXYFEO|5|This product was great. I love how it came with lights rather than just the plastic cover. Well built. Shipped at an extremely fast rate. 100% satisfied
B00068XCQU|5|I purchased this product a couple years ago so I have had plenty of time to test it out as I have had many occasions to use it.  I have charged ATV's, multiple cars, a golf cart, a riding lawn mower, you name it and I have used the Battery Tender plenty of times.  I use it for 4-6 months on a couple cars I store in the midwest winter and it maintains the battery's at full charge all the time without overcharging it.  I have since purchased 2 others so I can charge multiple auto's at a time as well as I have given one away to a family member who also stores a car in the winter.  Great, dependable Battery Tender.
B00I0H27EW|5|Quick delivery, fit my 2015 Soul.. I have already gotten people saying how cute they are. Thx. Happy customer😍
B003LK2GNU|5|Loooove it! :-)
B00K889FCI|5|That stuff really works my headlights was in bad shape and it brought them back to life so I recommend it to anyone it just takes a little bit of elbow grease but it really works I gave it a 5 star
B00V986HLS|3|Had to drill new holes in 2 of the hinges that attache to the gate. They were off by about 1/4 inch
B00YEVGG6I|3|Kind of small. I thought they would be bigger
B00HJ1592C|5|love the bling and the shoes. well made
B00IO32VPM|5|Looks good and fits perfectly.
B0014B85TM|5|Installed Saturday so far so good
B001P27YV0|4|I thought i was getting 2 wrenches but I only got one so just keep in mind. Besides that it has come in handy.
B00JA3BMDW|4|A good inexpensive IR thermometer. There is some &#34;drift&#34; in the reading, but it is consistent within a specific range. Mine reads 1.8 degrees high below 110 degrees F. Higher temperature seem to be ok.
B00DZ54I7I|1|Not what I expected
B0049QQV2M|3|I received the part today for my 1995 Buick Roadmaster. It definitely does not have the look and feel of the original. It looks very cheap. The metal holding the float is very thin. I dropped the tank and installed the fuel pump assembly today. I will put the tank back tomorrow and see how it works. The price was good, but it looks and feels cheap.
B00V2XHMBY|5|great Product.
B002P8CIIW|5|Easy install and seems to be pretty solid. Would buy again
B004GCOZTA|5|It was perfect for my 1989 Nissan D21.
B00EPDKOJU|5|They look great
B000GVAKJY|5|Great fit and quality.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|very effective in blocking the heat. Easy to use and portable.  Will recommend to friends.
B0006SU3QW|5|this stuff is A W E S O M E!!!
B00GRC81IS|3|graphics were thin, rear fender graphic fitment a bit off. looks good though!
B00N9LMXUC|5|I had one of these before but when it gets old, it starts flaking and making a dusty mess all over the dashboard.  This new one is perfect.  So far it's not flaking and it stays in place and really helps a lot to keep the inside of my car cooler, especially on those 108 degree days!!  It's definitely worth it, plus it protects your dash and seats from sun damage.
B00OLOBFVO|3|The first light my husband hooked up worked fine, however, the second light blew when he hooked it up. The light is very bright. Since the second one blew we have to order another one, which is very frustrating. It did not come with instructions so you just have to figure it out yourself. You also have to buy a switch & wiring separately for it as well.<br /><br />I received a discount on this product for my honest review.
B004J0UL42|5|works great
B00T7GYDTC|5|Great output. used on atv. was submerged and no water got in.
B00JGJGLMM|5|Heavy duty cable works for marine use.
B0089GD5RM|5|These pants have way more pockets than I thought. 9 total, with 7 of them having velcro closures. It was so nice having a pocket for everything. The standard front hip pockets fit my wallet and iPhone 6 perfectly, and I didn't feel like my belongings were going to fall out on the highway. There was also a perfect sized pocket for my eye drops and the large cargo pockets could have fit a sandwich, small first aid kit, etc. etc.<br />I wear a 32, so I ordered a 32. They are exactly 32&#34;. They are going to keep my diet on point! If you think you wear a 32 or are lying to yourself about your pant size, these will make an honest man out of you. The material is comfortable, flexible denim and my lower body didn't get hot despite the black color or the 80 degree SoCal weather. I took the knee pads out since I have a knee/shin guard that I use with my riding shoes, but I would use the included knee pads with my taller boots. My other favorite feature was the velcro-adjustable legs. My pant legs didn't flap around like bell bottoms in the wind. I would buy these again in a heartbeat, but I would also buy them as a gift for someone else.
B00DVOVOCK|5|Perfect fit and functions great
B00W6LS7P6|5|Perfect fit! And super fast shipping
B004HGP29M|5|Smells fresh.
B001AM8KKY|4|Works as expected.  No installation issues, except who wants to work on a car?  Most likely is the original manufacturer of the factory parts anyway.  Plus they're cheaper on Amazon.
B000Q6W9MU|5|Fits great. Fast delivery
B0002UNON8|1|Picked up a bottle of this at a local auto parts store in hopes of removing some swirl marks and light scratches. After using a Porter Cable DA polisher and going at a 2 foot by 2 foot section for about 5 minutes, none of the swirl marks or scratches went away. Just skip this product and opt for a more expensive and higher end scratch removal system.
B000VDYQXS|4|I love the color.  It's gorgeous.  It hides the dirt.  Nice size.  The only reason they didn't get 5 star is the blasted staples they use.  They are extremely strong and a huge pain to get off.
B0015PMZMU|4|This tool worked well when at the bench and I could clamp one end of the tool in a vise.  Trying to use it while under my car to flare existing brake lines was a bit of a challenge as I barely had the hand strength to hold one side while torquing the other side down.  Also, don't forget to slide a nut onto the line before flaring!  It saves wear and tear on your hands while limiting the cursing.
B000A0EJF2|5|Worked perfect!!!
B000R4PFFO|4|Didn't take the spots off the seat but did clean it up a little better than it was.
B00QFSAPP6|5|That's a good material, work perfect in my bar light on my truck, I recommend
B003G9G4X4|5|Worked perfect right out of the box and I got hot water right away! Simple installation, but will need the proper 1 & 1/2 inches socket. Hardest part was removing the stuff out of the way to access the nut with the socket, like the sheet metal coverings and gas burner tube, etc...
B009436GDO|4|Not the highest quality pair by all means, but a good starter pair.
B0007VM3DE|5|My son and I replaced our rusty old bumper on 2001 Ford Ranger Edge with this bumper using the appropriate Fey mounting kit.  It took about an hour to take off the old and to put on the new!  Looks great.
B00939MPOS|4|Good product, no issues.
B000BUU5Z4|5|Perfect for our RV. Installed it inside the medicine cabinet and it is perfect for our needs.
B00317007M|5|I got these cause I'm tired of buying expensive chrome mirrors that just end up pitting.  These are a great price and look great.
B000NPNXOW|2|I have tried using at numerous intersection where there is loops in the pavement.  I have yet to find one that it works on.  Still have to wave larger vehicles along side in order to trigger light.  I do not recommend this product.
B00IITRHQU|5|came sooner than promised. rotors,what can i say? they're cross drilled and slotted with a zinc plating, which means they're rust resistant. pads, they even had a no squeal pad on the back. this set-up stops smooth and quiet. at this price, you can't touch this at any auto pats store for a set-up like this.
B009AFFYR0|3|All in all good front cross piece wiggles a little not as tight as I would like ,reinstalled several times and adjusted its safe will carry the load, but has a little more wiggle than I would like to see
B00230P2E4|5|They were a tight fit, but I really like them.
B00MA7744G|5|Best light for the $$
B005ZHFXKU|1|You can't install it yourself doesn't come with enough schematics you need a  authorized dealer to do it. And most won't take the one you bought.
B000RMTDAE|5|Great paint, it dries fast, evenly and covers very well. Much better coverage than the competition. Does not need a primer for good coverage either. I have used every kind of spray paint there is and this is one of the best.
B000UK1WYS|5|ok
B006ZZ7N6S|5|Great
B0067UFF5W|5|parts fit great
B004RNR9BY|5|water hose came and easy to install - its a hose but i use it for drinking water and also cleaning
B00BMRZN66|5|Fantastic!!!!
B009IFIKAA|5|Easy to install, fitted perfect!
B00SV54LQU|5|Love it!!!!!
B00LZL0JJU|5|very good when applied
B00VDQNELW|5|Had read reviews about this as we recently purchased a 2015 jeep and read a review written by a man who said his dogs nails scratched the center console and he WISHED he had purchased this first before letting his dogs ride in his jeep. So, we ordered the neoprene armrest BEFORE letting our two doxies ride in our jeep. Yup! You guessed it, the first thing they did was to jump up onto the center console from the back seat and this neoprene armrest PROTECTED the center console from their nail scratches. My husband liked it so much he asked me to order a second one to use when the first one wears out. It also feels nice to the arm when driving the jeep as the neoprene material stays cool and you don't stick to the armrest when using it.
B011F8GC8E|4|Plastic, but do the job.
B005CLMEHE|5|Product is well made and worked as described! I would suggest watching a YouTube video for the installation since taking off the entire door paneling is not necessary.
B00EVINFCW|5|Good for what we used it for
B00HSZZHUS|4|They fit perfect. The floor coverage is wonderful. The mats are very light weight but seem to be sturdy.<br /><br />I haven't had them long enough to judge quality and long term use. However, these mats are well worth the price, if only for the coverage.
B00826OVWW|5|I use this thing for everything.  Creeper, small laptop stand, foot rest.........the possibilities are endless.  LOL.  And sturdy.
B00KTIHU0G|5|Put this on one of those ur vehicles and it looks great. Has held up a couple months so far.
B002XMSFIM|4|Exactly what I wanted.
B001O0XLOW|1|Boy, do these pads suck!!  sounded like metal on metal right after installation.  And with new rotors too!<br />Swapped them out for new pads from Lexus and now the brakes work beautifully.  These are the brand of pads<br />used by Firestone for their discounted brakes jobs and customer's often come back complaining of noise from their<br />brakes.
B004Y8LB7K|5|It fits perfectly on the 2014 Civic!
B004GC4Q0I|5|Fast shipping and exact oem replacement
B00JKSP41S|5|Works great !
B00CW9JKU8|5|I have an MR2 that I am restoring.
B002Z85I5W|5|Very Nice
B008025186|5|Awesome wax! The spray on method really makes it quick and easy to wax a car. I prefer to lightly spray the car, and a microfiber applicator pad, and then spread the wax out with the pad. The only downside to this waxing method, is that it gets into/behind places you normally wouldn't get wax, and you will get a lot more areas that you miss when wiping off if you're not careful.
B0050HJNW4|5|Item as decribed. Came with instructions.
B004GCD6PE|1|I get me wrong package
B00KSQLUNM|5|Funny stuff!
B00H47IT78|4|looks and works great so far
B00EEDWMT6|5|Adds a nice Euro look to the ride. Love it! Plus the frame fits the plate perfectly. My bumper doesn't have any holes for a front license plate so I just used some zip ties. Worked like a charm
B00LMGORXC|5|This are excellent filters made by MANN FILTER in Czech Republic!!!
B00XZ9OGTO|5|It was very easy to do and great alternative to buying the real exspensive one when all you have to do is reprogram a remote
B00OWK4E3I|5|Best chamois I've purchased in 25 years! Buy this Chamois, it's great.
B008R13ZKG|5|delivery was quick.<br />I tried to change the tensioner before I had this tool but it was not easy in fact I damaged the tensioner.<br />It took me about 30 minutes to remove and repair the tensioner.<br />This tool is well worth the money.
B009IFIIJI|5|Fit great and worked great.
B0082B2QR4|5|Fits perfectly but too damn expensive
B0078SDMK2|5|good value ,rim stopper is too flimsy though and bends if you lean against it even a little but other than that it does a good job
B009IFIIM0|4|PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED
B000CMKF2E|5|I've had the floor liners for a while now... about 6 years. I have them in the front (drivers and passengers side), second row seats and third row seats/cargo area for my SUV. They work very well at keeping the carpets underneath dry and keeping small amounts of liquids inside the liner. Definitely worth the money and the carpets underneath still look new. I also have 2 kids... the liners work very well.
B00NLOLSMQ|5|Perfect fit again.  Great product from a great company!
B004Q7AGRU|5|just need to order my rear mats now:)
B001JT36IY|5|yes was as I like it plus the first one broke because the wind now i install a spring I hope this improve the signal and make durable the antenna  Thanks for the prompt service and the attention I will keep buying from AMAZON RAFAEL
B0002NYE4I|5|Good
B000C5WCUE|5|Great part now car is running good.
B00CMTMDNY|5|installation was a wiz, the rickey bobby dodge undercover car runs down illegal ailens, gets them back in jail.
B001OMPJGS|5|Very happy. Look great on my 78 Spitfire...you may want to consider buying new h4 plugs and relays with these lights. The difference is truly amazing compared to the stock headlights!
B004DK4P5O|5|Great,thankyou fit perfect just in time before a big rain to put window up lol thanks fast excelent service,highly recomend
B00700E8QA|5|Got here fast. Good product.
B00MVN6TS6|3|It works but the led light is not blue, its more white/yellow.
B001CF53PY|4|great product, makes summer Jeep life a bit more enjoyable.
B00030DLEE|5|I am a service tech so I'm always on the road and growing very tired of fast food. I saw this product and decided to give it a go after all it isn't too much money. Long story short I love this food warmer. It has made my life so much better as far as food on the road goes. It only takes about 10-20 mins to heat up your food and bam! You have delicious home cooked food in your work truck :) worth it!
B01137RI7G|4|Haven't used it yet but the quality is what I was looking for. Should do the job.
B000E4B8CQ|5|Good mirror
B000CPCBF0|5|ok

B00JVHLS3G|5|A nice product!
B00L2K6JXY|5|Was a gift the was appreciated. Came with needed hanging materials.
B004H6S5OG|5|I love goombas.
B010RIDGVE|5|Good quality made sticker
B00DDV2NL2|1|would give 0 stars but I have to give it atleast one this product does not work my engine light is on because I got my oil changed by a friend and not the dealer they always reset it when they do it even wasted money to be able to erase the codes ect. and it still wont work this is the second of my cars ive tried it on and its the same thing works but wont let me erase the code very disappointed in this
B005J38X9S|5|Very bright, low profile, works great
B000C9XZPQ|5|c
B000QQ1JHQ|5|Great replacement shocks.
B001S8F2V0|5|Half the price compared to Napa, fit perfectly fixed my problem of air blowing only to defrost and floor
B009K6ZH6W|5|Arrived quickly...good quality part thank you#
B0031I1WRS|4|2008 Nissan Altima S 2.5 - The part looked great.  Seated well in installation.  Has been working fine for the past 3 months.  No issues yet.
B0055E5R8G|3|good fender for price
B001DH6EH2|5|It's cheep, but a Perfect Fit.<br /><br />My buddy is a pro mechanic, so that certainly helps.  But, we had zero issues installing, took about 40 minutes.<br /><br />Went into a 2000 Eddie Bauer Explorer.  No problems after three months
B005O4VAT2|2|Cheap and fast
B0093XLGVM|1|The worst neither of them worked
B00D9H2OLO|5|Installed on the bar end of my Ducati Diavel Dark.  Slightly shorter than my stock bar end weights but not noticeable.  Allowed me to install CRG arrow bar end mirrors and looks great.  Good quality.  Will buy again.
B000H01NFY|5|I purchased this based on reviews and i have to say that it works great. I changed the coolant in my 05 SV650 earlier this year and my bike has been running nice n cool since. Ill be buying another bottle when i flush the coolant again next year. I would recommend this for any bike, super sport or cruiser.
B00032KC3K|5|Work perfectly.  They do not fall off and you can not see the screws.  Makes for a better look.
B000CMF1GO|5|Double gaskets under the front unit(dual quads on a small block,ya know) took care of a vacuum leak. Seems to have more power through the mid-range too. Wise choose .
B008Y96H6A|5|This got the job done
B00K69GEQY|5|Bright green backlight gives a very clear sharp reading of the time.  keeping accurate time so far.
B00B9GFMXE|5|Love this sticker! The spacing between the words is a little much but I fixed that by cutting the sticker on half then placing them where I wanted them. 🌹
B00079FOK0|5|Works great, NOT JUNK
B00BHI2UBG|5|Great handy tool
B00BD4SK0Y|5|These seat covers are not made of the highest quality fabric (very thin) and I knew that when I ordered them; however, they look great and serve the purpose.  They are soft and look sporty in my 2002 Mazda Miata. I would recommend them if you just want to cover leather seats that get too hot.
B000GD5FMY|5|The glasses are exactly as described. Can't wait to try them out on my next ride in the next couple weeks.
B00KJ8JEAU|5|shipped fast , works great
B00OU5LOT2|5|I bought two packs. One for me and one for my father. Installed them in both cars the next day after receiving them and we both loved them. They look amazing at night. When my boyfriend saw the package at first he laughed. But after he saw them, he loved them and now he wants them for his car. Will order more in the future. Will post pictures
B001RMA5S2|5|Worked like a charm.  NGK never lets me down.
B0048085AK|5|had one before... they work great
B00KQPJSVQ|5|Good tools.  Very sturdy.
B010EXY52Q|3|Storage case is none functional. Zipper broke when trying to open the package.
B00FKYS2XS|4|Delievered on time. Fit perfectly and Sounds great.
B00DVWK7YI|5|It's hard plastic, which I was mad about at first because it looked like metal in the product pic, however I realized this makes it lighter and the holes are decently sized my fingers are tiny but I'll be getting one for my mom who works in a dangerous area of town, and she has (not to be rude) fat fingers.
B00DR6RDPO|3|Wasn't for me but they seemed pleased
B00VMS0Q9O|4|harness is of good quality. I REALLY like that all wire is protected by heat resistant pvc wire wrap (228 degree rating). Only thing that could use improvement is the relay should be waterproofed but it can be switched out with a waterproof one if desired. Upside to the relay set up is that they ran all the wires for the relay into a harness that slips over the terminals on the relay.
B003M73GAE|5|Makes it so easy to take my boots off. Wish I had bought it sooner.
B000CFRL32|1|Jeep ran hotter with this radiator than the factory  single row aluminum/plastic rad.  Very unimpressed.  The seller wes-new was very easy to deal worth for a return though.  5 stars on them!  Replaced this csf with a champion 2 row aluminum and now i can drive in the heat with the ac on again.
B00NFSNAS8|5|Compact. It has two option - 12V and 110V - very convenient. Recommend it.
B00537Q1YO|5|seems like just what i was looking for
B002VMSJ8U|5|Product looks great and came fast!!
B000C9TD2K|5|Wix makes one of the best oil filters on the market. Also other filters. Use them a lot.
B0002YR6EW|5|great no more low tires on lawn mower to keep airing up
B00BYNJ7OW|5|Great shock fell the difference from my Ranchos right away like day and night the Ranchos did have about 80,000 miles on them but rides better than new
B00U0UWNK0|5|These look amazing on my 2015 Audi RS5 Cabriolet in Misano Red with the Black Optic package.  Could not have picked a better design.
B00009PGNS|1|Stopped cooling after less than 2 months of use.
B009KW9JRO|5|excellent , I recommend
B000DT7VYG|5|Perfect fit. 1995 jeep YJ 2.5.
B0039Z1UHA|5|Used on 1995 Jeep Wrangler, would most likely use again. Especially on a motorcycle project. Make sure to use at least 2 clamps on each end.
B000C846NW|3|decent
B00OW0NQGE|5|Very nice and user friendly key fob. Well-made high quality item. Recommended, I would buy again and probably will, and I hope this helps. It does not fit in my Acura MDX key fob but does with a large key ring easily attached to this fob. The hook on this is like a carabineer, so, easy to attach. I like it a lot and it is very easy to hook up and use. I wish my spouse would use one as she is always digging in her purse to find it. This helps me pull it out of my pocket on my Wranglers easily.
B002G47GE6|5|Good Product, fast delivery.. I'm a very happy camper....
B0035X5GH6|1|They did not fit my door!!
B00XBB2SBO|2|The deflectors fit well on the vehicle, but it's really disappointing that the adhesive that holds them to the surface is not strong enough. I installed them with good amounts of distributed pressure, but a couple of the plastic pieces separate from their sticky adhesive foam. Thus, I need to re-press these exposed edges back down and will likely need to do this more frequently over time.
B001PQDMV2|5|Do yourself a favor and buy these mats
B0016HURFO|5|Fits 2007 H3 with no problem. Just make sure u buy 11/16 socket.
B00373V8C6|5|Replaced my originals  that were 23 years old. These are identicle.  Looks like brand new.  Highly recommend.
B000Z7D1FO|5|Installed on a 2008 Tahoe LS 5.3 Flex fuel. This was installed in conjunction with a K&N Cold air intake kit. Total fuel mileage increase 2-3 miles a gallon hwy, 1 MPG city. Throttle response improved. If you can keep your foot out of the throttle i this you will see a small fuel economy improvement. I think it is a worth while investment if you are looking for simple easy to install performance add on. I did not notice ant loud whistling from this application.
B0041CFX8M|4|I took a star off because they look great and function well, but the attachment A for the honda needed some pretty good sanding with a seemed before it would work without sticking for a vtx 1300c.
B002P8EMK4|5|Easy install, pretty solid othan than at speeds above 45 or so the glass vibrates pretty badly (could have something to do with my tires though). Would buy again
B000JK6INE|4|I've used a lot of waxes but this is the deepest shine I ever had on a car<br /> Then I did my motorcycle and oh wow. If you don't think it works just wait till you hand wash your car the next time and see how.easy the dirt comes off. And if that doesn't Convince you watch the wa tr er bed up on the car next time it rains.
B00I89EMR2|5|Good decals. Fast shipping.
B008FIVEMW|5|fits good, looks good, and was EZ to put one.  I hope it last the 4 years it is warranted.
B00176MKCC|5|Very  light  and  fits  my  Burgman 400 well.  Been  using  over a month  outdoors in  the hot southern summer  and  looks  brand  new.  It's still early to tell,  but  so  far no  complaints at  all.
B001AZEMI0|3|Looks good as far as the straps garbage nylon straps do not stay put
B00HTP8N0I|5|good product. material is little thin but can't complain for all the more they cost
B00HZ870GM|5|I have a 6.6l duramax will it make my truck black smoke ?
B007552NHQ|5|Way better than the cheaper ones in 100 degree weather.
B001F5ELM2|5|Great
B001G7MBMG|5|Fits perfectly for my 06 Murano.
B003WOZOUM|4|Works fine....except the intructions for putting it on your car without a luggage rack are not good at all we had to figure it out on our own.
B003VASH2Y|1|Very thin material. Practically unusable.<br />If the price was lower, I'd probably would have given it two stars.
B0015YBYCS|5|Very satisfied with these tire covers in white.  Well built & durable, nice to have our trailer tires protected from the weather.
B000E4RQ7M|5|Just like from factory.. New in box and easy to install.
B00QI7GVD4|4|Using in vhull boat for cup holder.
B00R980F3S|4|Cheaper than original. Good quality.
B00T99KPQW|5|I received the items quick and received items as described thankyou
B00PWG6AC4|2|When I received these, they were already torn. Even so, I really needed something for my car, so I tried to use them. Their coverage is just okay, but what got me was that I couldn't figure out how to fold them up neatly after using them, even though I was using the diagram and following the directions provided.  I expected better, and would recommend that you purchase a different sunshield if you're looking for effective dash coverage.
B002KCE6LU|5|Happy with quality of this item.  Used in my jeep adventures.  It is durable and pricing is right.
B0031ZDU62|5|Very satisfied with seller and product!
B00ZZGE4LU|5|First, I did receive jump starter free for the purpose of testing and review. I realize that a review of a free product is fundamentally different from a review of a product that was paid for by the reviewer, but I do take my reviewing very seriously, and thus I hope that my impressions and observations will still prove helpful to you in your decision making. If you have questions about the product, post them in the comments section and I'll do my best to answer based on my own use of the product.<br /><br />What is this and what's it supposed to do?:<br />This is a jump start kit that allows you to jump start a 12 V car battery up to 20 times before needing to be recharged itself.  In addition to that function, it also serves as a power bank and can charge your devices such as cell phones and tablets. This is a 10000mAh kit and capable of fully charging an iPhone 6 Plus 3 times.  The kit comes with a USB adapter with lightning, micro-USB, mini-USB and 30 pin options, so you're covered on just about anything you'd need to charge.<br /><br />Does it work?:<br />Yes, it jumps a 12V battery without difficulty. It also charges devices without difficulty.  I've tested the product and have the following observations to share about its use:<br /><br />Charging the charger: Mine arrived with a charge, but I wanted to make sure it was fully charged before beginning testing.  It charges in about 4 1/2 hours with the provided wall charger and 10 hours with a micro-USB. The user's guide states that the charger should be recharged every 3 months to ensure longest battery life.<br /><br />Charging devices: The kit includes a usb charging adapter kit with lightning, micro-USB, mini-USB, and 30 pin. There are 2 USB out ports for charging.  When engaged, a battery life indicator appears on the unit. At 10000mAh, you'll be able to charge most phones at least a few times.<br /><br />Jump-starting an auto: At 600 peak amps, this kit will handle most jump starting jobs without difficulty. This particular kit features a smart cable that can give you quite a bit of feedback. Plug the cables into the unit and then hook the red clamp to the positive battery post and the black to the negative battery post.  Now that smart cable will display either get a green or red indicator light. Flashing green indicates stand-by, solid green means you're ready to turn the key. A flashing red means the unit has too little charge to do the job, and a solid red means it's not happening for a variety of reasons, all discussed in the user's guide. I really like this smart cord.  It's longer than those of other kits I've tested, and I like the feedback the light gives, I haven't seen that on other kits yet. Anyway, the takeaway here is that jump starting is really easy with this unit.<br /><br />LED flashlight:  All of these kits come with an LED flashlight function.  I don't care much about this, but you might so: once the unit is powered on, simply pressing the power button again will turn on the flashlight and subsequent presses will cycle from solid to flashing to off again. The unit powers itself off after about 10 seconds of inactivity.<br /><br />Anything else of note?:<br />-As of the posting of this review, the kit is eligible for free shipping to members of Amazon Prime, but they state there is some processing time involved to make that happen. I'm not sure what that means exactly.<br />-I'm impressed with how small the unit is. Very easy to store in a vehicle and could actually fit in many glove boxes.<br />-This can actually be charged in a couple of different ways, either with the provided DC adapter, or via micro-USB.<br /><br />Any negatives?:<br />-To this point, I have not come across any problems. I'll return and revise the review if anything changes.<br /><br />Bottom line:  These kits have been one of my favorite discoveries on Amazon over the past year.  No more begging strangers for assistance when your battery dies. Just bring out your kit, hook itup and you're ready to go.  I've assisted several motorists with my own kits over the past few months and to a man they always say &#34;I'm buying one of those today.&#34; I really like this particular kit and for 10000mAh and 600 peak amps, it's surprisingly compact.  I like everything about it from its packaging to its ease of use.  It jump starts a battery without difficulty, acts as a power bank for the charging of devices and manages to look pretty cool doing it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a jump start kit.up and you're ready to go.

B002P8QL26|1|wrong size
B00OB8E1ES|3|get what you pay for !!!
B000B8GAOQ|5|Works just like it's supposed to!
B007TS6FNC|5|Love this! I use it for my kids toys and it never falls over. stays right in place no matter how bumpy the ride. Just the right size. Cute pattern. I LOVE this thing!
B00W6KYJ9U|5|Love, love, love this folding sunshade for our jeep. It has a carrying case it fits into when not in use to save it from being stuck behind the seat on the floor when not in use.
B0067PUMXW|5|For something so cheap, this has become a great conversation starter and it is located on my windshield to be more obvious.
B000B66UXE|1|Product did not fit properly. Stripped with first use and handle broke.
B006VFR37G|2|There was supposed to be a set screw? Mine did not come with a set screw. Mine didn't even have a hole where a set screw would go. I though I was doing something wrong, and there is no way to know if your doing it right or not because this product does not come with instructions. Not even a suggested link to a helpful Drake sponsored YouTube site. so I hit it with a rubber mallet a couple of times to see if it would set like the OEM part does. As im sure you know that didn't work. Then after trying a few different glues, that failed, I used epoxy and now it stays on real nice and snug.  It looks nice and feels good, but if your looking to buy, don't expect instructions. I guess they are too expensive to put on the back of the packaging.
B00RSOLXFM|5|It really works!
B001BFS4TC|5|a ok
B00F8KP9SA|3|Excellent disc brake tool set.  If the manufacturer would have included a user guide I would have rated with five starts. If you are comfortable figuring things out like this on your own, this is a reasonable choice.  I suspect that there are other options in this price range that include instructions.  If you can find one, I recommend going that route.
B006H34BUY|3|I really don't know why I purchased this item.
B005F16O04|5|Look nice and fits! Easy to put on..
B00QXODFX6|5|Love the item! Description was exact.
B000FW2MCM|1|I've bought three different brands of car compasses. None worked at all
B00LWKOC1U|4|LooKS great, needs more wiring though. Had to pay out of pocket for wiring.
B000E2ARGG|4|Same as the other parts, cannot review since they weren't for me. Wasn't sent back because it will be used.
B00RBF0782|4|Good
B00OIABWW8|4|easy to install on my mercury 50hp outboard.
B00075OSC4|5|my first Optima Red Top lasted 9 years.  I'm sure this one will do as well.
B003SU0XM4|5|really like the mat
B000CDIHT6|5|Works as advertised and expected.
B00INAV8BY|5|worked great
B0051ZIJKC|5|It's very good item, good material , very useful,<br />It's saved the day,,<br />Advise you buy it.
B0045V8CKU|5|Very solid rack and the best deal out there. Installation was pretty easy.
B0002JM69W|1|Very poorly made. It literally started coming apart with less than a month of light use. Should be dropped from Amazon.
B002D3KR4Q|5|Fit perfectly.
B001P7C7QM|5|Pump works like a champ
B00GOQE12W|5|Worth the money but please dont buy love still being one of the only ones on the road with them.
B00GSAUHB8|5|This Sunshade is great primarily because it has the two main &#34;shade&#34; sections are attached with loose (unstructured) material in the middle of your windshield and has some on the outside edges as well.  This allows me to fill in the gaps between the main &#34;shades&#34; around my mirror, and on the edges and corners.  I also like it because it fits a larger windshield in the truck, but also fits a smaller windscreen of the mid-sized/economy car.  When not in use, it folds up into a frisbee sized disc, and slides between the seats. I would recommend this product.
B000IY8P7I|5|Product fit exactly as intended, appears to be OEM quality, and really improved air flow.
B00S1K3KQC|5|I followed the sizing chart and had a perfect fit right out of the box, good air flow, quality materials. An absolutely great deal for a super low price. Typhoon makes a great product.
B001UJB9AU|5|Holding up well for 5+ washes so far, takes a while to dry, but removes a lot of dirt and has never scratched my paint! I think it holds particulate much better than microfiber mitts, it's incredibly fluffy. Like a wet wheaten terrier, although those are harder to hold maneuver when washing your car.
B0054RW1HE|1|Will never by these again, didn't fit my 2013 Jeep JK as stated.
B000CB6FNS|5|great Item. It looks good on my Jeep Jk and an easy install.
B00XZD23SG|5|Perfect fit, high quality product, looks great!
B00U2NHLTI|4|I was expecting more output from installing these in my fog's in my '15 Mazda CX-9, however, I was sad to see the output was not much more apparent than the halogen bulbs.  This is more than likely the result of the reflector housing than the bulb, however it is why I knocked off one start.  Otherwise, the color perfectly matches the OEM daytime running LED's and HID's on my model, and the Philips brand gives me reassurance that the product should last quite some time.  I later found that the fog lights in my vehicle are easily swappable with Hella 90MM projectors, however, this bulb won't fit those housings, and Philips doesn't make a bulb that will.  So I'm sticking with the current setup.  installation was easy, plug and play, and the ballast is so light that it's not necessary to mount it anywhere.  Pic has Philips in the left, stock halogen in the right.
B00ZQ32I5G|4|Fit well and will work just fine.  These are replacing pads on a racebike that I never really use the rear brake on anyway.
B00CAYG3ZK|5|Great product and super fast shipping. works like a champ
B00KC85GXG|5|it is what I need
B000CMJOVC|3|Super thin but does not float like the set for the front driver and passenger do.
B00CTVN3DY|1|Horrible quality. thin and heat bubbled it up.
B004L3FO9Y|5|Faucet looks great. Was easy to install.
B003SZREJY|5|Worked perfectly.  As described
B00SS1AJCW|1|Picture displayed is of a shift lever.  When I put this product in my wish list while looking, it explained it was a heal/toe shifter and that it was 1 3/4 inch longer than stock shifters.  It also came up when I was looking for &#34;extended heal/toe shifters.  Once received instead of heal toe shifters, delivered separately, it was two shift covers.  Will see how returns work with vendor and if I can get the correct part.
B00877SL2M|5|Their bright and work great. I only had 1 go bad after 2 years of use.
B00H9P1JT0|1|Have not been able to get the sensors to synch yet. After a week of trying. Believe the directions could be done much better. At this point I am close to returning them .
B003PVJWIW|5|Great tin sign! Love it for outside bar
B00N4GZ8NQ|5|Good mirrors, they worked perfectly on my 03 2500HD.
B000C7TU9I|5|good
B009MIPH4K|5|Very impressed with this portable folding solar panels rig.  Tried it out today on our A-Frame pop-up RV.  It was so simple to put it into operation; it came with a brief instruction leaflet that tells you all that you need to know without being an electrical engineer.  So simple to select your battery type (Sealed,Gel, or Flooded).  It came with a very basic controller that just seems to do the job.  I purchased the separate volt meter just to know the status of the battery.  Comes with a semi-hard storage case that is really nice.  The 120-watt panels might be overkill for our single sealed 12-volt marine battery, but ya never know what might be added in the future.  Best of all, my dear spouse, Celia, gave it enthusiastic approval.  I highly endorse this &#34;GO POWER !&#34; solar rig over the other company's offerings (begins with an &#34;R&#34;).  I also recommend the 30-FT extension; out in the 'boonies', your RV rig might be camped under some nice shady trees & you'll be glad for the solar panel(s) power extension.
B0002SRCYW|5|Worked as expected, easy on, line came right off.
B000N9ZL1Q|4|Worked fine. Fit was tricky sometimes. Because of chasing a coil pickup problem I had to take this on and off many times. Compared to the cap I took off that had corroded contacts this cap seemed trickier to line up. All in all for the price I really can't complain. I find it to very adequate and at value price so you get a decent deal overall.
B006O85UNE|5|Fast shipping, great quality, chain was protected in a lube type grease, and was the correct length for my bike.
B000H4LT3Q|5|Real fast delivery. Now to hook them up. Thanks.
B007IPL0PY|5|Perfect fit...Fast delivery
B0012RJZT2|5|perfect and saved alot of time
B003WHBVDI|5|Great product, like the safety ratchet lid and no spill dispensing unit.  It provides comfort, knowing that on long runs you have a backup handy.  I have an older Road King Classic, and the unit doesn't fit into the back of the saddle bag as advertised, however, it sits forward enough for me to pack spare oil/fluids behind it, with no wasted space.  I'd definitely recommend this to a friend.
B000C9PKM2|5|SUPER FAST  DELIVERY.... WILL ORDER AGAIN
B000C9QU5I|5|Solved my problem, good heavy bearing made in USA....
B002QGVW3K|5|Excellent shipping, battery charged right up, couldn't be more pleased with the shipping, handling, and product.
B00SLKS6SO|4|Good quality material. Lets see how it holds up but overall very satisfied with my purchase. The instructions are not very clear but if your good with tools and have common sense it shouldn't be a problem.
B009CBJZLI|5|Awesome. Great price. I should really buy another for my spare. What incredible quality and attention to detail. The blue is the perfect hue.
B00KY3G3SG|5|This is one of the best lanyards I bought from amazon the kawasaki writing is on both sides and it is a smooth texture
B004I0G4IA|1|said they fit my truck and were dead wrong. i even confirmed it with amazon.
B00LCBK6CS|5|Perfect
B0054HMF20|5|great buy! fast delivery!
B00JBICUXC|3|its okay
B00S3XMSY2|5|I purchased this spinner after I broke my left arm and found it difficult to steer in tight spots (like parking lots). After reading reviews about similar products not fitting steering wheels, I decided to get this one because it didn't have a screw and nut fastener.<br /><br />Works perfectly for my '06 Honda Pilot. Love it - love it - cast is off, still using it. My husband wants it for his John Deere tractor - going to get him his own!
B004IX1XLK|3|the chrome upper part is excellent, the black filler panel is too large to fit in the well and must be trimmed 0.150&#34; around the perimeter. The aluminum mesh must be massaged and trimmed to work also. The pins are misaligned to the hood causing the holes in the hood to be enlarged slightly to fit proper. Once completed it looks very good and what I had hoped - I replaced the 67 grilles with the 68 which are more my taste. The part is nice and heavy as it should be. It also came with the required sheetmetal nuts as you would expect.
B00REJXRS2|5|Fits truck perfectly , awesome look , works great.
B008BX0AUI|5|Nice and bright for my Lexus IS250
B00B1TNQCS|5|Perfect fit. Protects the bed of my 2015 Tacoma and cuts out some of the road noise too. Good investment.
B00SZK240Q|5|Cool like the. Alot
B00CFALFXY|5|great for everything!
B010MHNMKA|5|keeps your behind dry
B00KTIYXLU|2|Programmed one and it works fine. Then as soon as the second is programmed, the first quit working. Tried programming the first one again, and the second one quit working. It seems you can only use one of them at a time! We bought two so my husband and I could each have one, but we can only use one.
B002FRFZYW|5|Anything Raiders is always 5 stars
B000BM3B3A|3|Its really too small compared with others I have bought in the past. Low pressure air, I will not buy this again.
B00S1WDSK8|5|Items are as described. Came in white box. Well packed. Took for adjusting included. Was purchased for. Golf cart but they were so bright I changed them out with the cubes I had on my truck.  They look better too.
B0022ZR3O2|3|I'm sure this gauge is a perfectly fine product, but I haven't opened it yet and am considering sending it back because it does NOT include the black rubber protective cover as seen in the product photo. The owner questions on the product page show that some buyers get the cover and others don't...Very odd.
B007L2JNT4|5|These were a great fit, easy install. Slight mirror vibration at freeway speeds. I am really pleased so far.
B00192MU2Y|5|A very nice product.  The end of my extension cord was messed up.  Cut it off and put this on.  Works great, good instructions.
B003ZGKKD8|4|Nice
B0013G1XCY|1|Missing  all seal for instillaion.<br />Had external springs  AC Delco  has internal springs.<br />Where motor is located,  in plastic  missing  a snap in cover to protect where pump motor is.  Was graded  as like new,  but to many issues.<br />Returned, waiting for full refund.<br />Already ordered a different pump.
B000Y58QBQ|2|It has a deep scratch right in the middle. Not happy
B009PQCOVI|5|Fit perfectly. Less than 10 minutes to install
B000C5C9FM|4|Just what I needed to replace the old broken ones on my 1882 AMC SX/4, though only the pink ones are the ones I needed.
B004AJ4HWY|5|The air suspension went out on my 2000 Ford Expedition that has over 250K miles.  Didn't want to put a lot of money into the car so found the conversion kit and gave it a try.  Car rides smoothly.  Glad I purchased it.
B002K6CD2K|4|They look great on my 2013 Nissan Maxima.  Just wish there was the matchin brights and fog lights to match!
B000IYSKU0|5|This radiator met my expectations, it fixed my problem snd I am a happy customer.
B00129CJB6|5|Good quality, fast shipping
B008MCDPZU|5|It was like un the picture. Deliverd faster than my expectation.
B00JGEDPLW|5|A must for your Can Am Maverick!!
B000ALG86E|5|Car cover was as expected. It fit perfect and stay's on in the wind. There are tie downs to secure it as well. The material is strong and the price was great.
B0036TOFY4|5|Great price with fast delivery to my door in 808.
B00AQ48KGG|4|As expected.  Thanks
B00TEFMB2M|5|Worked well, as described.
B00SQG8HN2|4|Good quality decal.
B00U6HQSQ2|5|As advertised
B002PR8ZXK|4|Great product, not bad price, the replacement filter are a little expensive in the $38 - $45 range but not to bad. Will last about a month. Depending on how much you use your air compressor.
B00HS5LDX8|5|These brakes were a lot better than the ones Toyota installed.  I had my brakes done by Toyota and they always made grinding noises. Toyota said that's the way they are supposed to sound.  I don't think so.  A family member installed they brakes and I have not heard another noise.  I am very happy
B0024GR0S8|2|I PURCHASED THIS ITEM AND WITHIN 7 MONTHS AND ONLY BEING USED A FEW TIMES CORRECTLY THE AIR COMPRESSOR HAS QUIT WORKING.  I WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.
B006N96BL4|5|excellent
B00HSEVOY2|4|Tough to put on.
B00NUIONWA|5|The product arrived on time. Very satisfied with the order and product.
B006R9F5JE|5|Great!
B00ANZHG7C|3|Towels are really a tad too small for drying a car.
B0013CXCYK|1|Product is best. They should find a better way to hang on the bumper. It is not even 2 months and adhesive is gone. Thru should retail the product. Shipping charges are a pure loss. Company vision may be this way. But they should consider retail otherwise other players ate eating their share.
B00A3D2LOC|5|Great fit, good as oem.
B000CICYQI|5|A really sweet deal. Car shows it's appreciation for the clutch. It my title could do facial expressions I am sure it would smile.
B000A8MZ78|5|Worked perfect
B00S66THWM|1|The first time I turned the water on and the hose charged the quick disconnect flew right off the end. I would absolutely not recomment this product to anyone.
B004I118QC|5|I'm very happy with product
B00EOG3O22|5|Although I have seen, and have several Masonic related badges myself, this was the first time I've seen one for a Masonic Youth Group.  Both my wife and my daughter have been involved with Jobs Daughters for several years, and I was happy to be able to give them each one of these car emblems so they could display their Masonic Affiliation with pride.
B0002SQYTG|5|As advertised, well made at a good price.
B004LQH6ME|5|Great kit.  Hope to never use it, but looks quality.
B000TR4JE2|5|Excellent roof rack, it arrived on time. I installed this rack and unfortunately it will not allow the rear hatch to open (standard Mini Cooper S). Not too good on a long trip. I am however considering turning the rack around. I don't think the bike will mind, but may make a bit of noise.<br /><br />I considered as others here have to cut a section of this rack off to allow the rear hatch to open. However I think if I were to do this, it would remove the stop for the rear wheel pad. Great for day trips.. Long trips I would consider the style that allows the wheels to remain on the bike.
B00AKG93O8|1|Not really impressed with the results of this or the stainless steel blackener I purchased from this company.
B0013HJDOI|4|Bought it based on AMMO NYC / DRIVE CLEAN recommendations, and it works well for interior detailing. Loses some bristles at first, but good after that. Softer bristles than expected for a first-time detailer like me, a scrub with a microfiber towel can be rougher, but better at getting into crevices and leather.
B001TNX0IQ|5|I was originally introduced to this car odorant about 4 years ago, and I can say that I am satisfied with the product every single time.. 👍🏻 And love the display of it, i always get asked &#34;what kind of devise it is&#34; 👍🏻
B00ISGE53G|5|Great grip, no seams to fray, but mine came with a tiny nick which I can feel when my hand runs across it (like a hangnail).  I'll have to trim it off carefully and smoothly.  I got for my RAV4 which takes more muscle to turn.
B007SR3Q9A|5|Exactly what I expected!
B00C7S9K8Q|5|I love this light on my ATV.
B004NLZQ06|5|Perfect fit.
B002TMQ4AM|5|Way better than the WeatherTech mats that my brother has in his car.<br /><br />These cover more on all the sides, especially up behind the pedals.
B008X02LM4|1|Terrible!  Stay away.  Go with the Gabriel struts.
B009LM88MU|5|Never myself have I done any exhaust work, bought this and it took be about and hour and a half to install, hardest part is taking the old exhaust off the rubber hooks but even that wasn't too hard. Highly recommend, sounds great, I did not use the silencers.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|According to my housekeeper it's a great product and very easy to use. She's already having other customers she cleans for get the product.
B00029X0XI|5|Good protection & looks cool.
B00C7OQXGW|5|I bought this to use to lubricate the actions of a few firearms (M1As and AK47s). It works very well, holds up to the extreme heat and stays in place and doesn't just cook off like oil..
B00H46KLNY|5|PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED
B001525H96|1|It broke in a week :(
B00BCRMAAS|1|I don't usually review, but I felt I had to for this product. The covers are flimsy and not at all what was described. It's actually 2 pieces, one goes over the seat and the other over the backrest to create one seat cover.<br /><br />With that said, there is absolutely no way to connect the 2 pieces once they are installed except via loops that you thread a clip to and then clip to your car. The material is flimsy and I ripped three loops trying to clip them to my car.<br /><br /> I've had them for a week now and every single time I get out of my car, my seat cover comes with me and I have to tuck it back in.<br /><br />This is not worth the money and I'm bitterly disappointed with the product. Do not buy these seat covers, they are awful and I'm already looking for new ones. Complete waste of money. I have to give one star because you can't give zero, but if I could I would!
B00QHHN3R2|5|EXELLENT PRODUCT!
B00CNA2BV6|2|I returned them. It was very difficult to close the plastic case they are supposed to be stored in. They were not as soft and smooth as others I have had in the past.
B00UNTU3VO|3|Works, but it tends to snag on areas of the car and come unraveled. You can trim them off but I'm afraid I'll run out of fibers eventually.
B0094FZ5KM|5|Good product. Great price. Also quick shipping.
B0076SO3VG|5|Awesome stickers. Well worth the price.
B007M5QH4Y|5|Was easy to install and works as advertised
B00FZ7WDB2|5|So far I love these. I've put about 600+ miles on them thus far. They are lightweight and comfortable, yet they don't feel flimsy. Luckily I haven't had to crash test them, but they feel up to the task. They are very comfortable on and off the bike, and they transmit feel very well. I have some footwear that makes it hard to find neutral and makes shifting cumbersome. These do the job and feel great while doing it. I have walked around in them for hours with no complaint. They look pretty good with jeans or black pants when you're off the bike. The material feels good and the assembly and stitching looks sturdy and durable. I haven't bothered to use the included 'shift protector' which basically slips over the left toe. My shift peg hasn't left any marks on the shoe yet. I used it on my first ride in these, and a few times I had to reach down and readjust the protector from sliding off my foot. Not worth it. They don't seem to need the added protection that it provides. My feet haven't overheated in these, and they fit snug in all the right places. I'm excited to own these.
B00IB1X73M|5|Fit great, looks great.
B008BLGV62|5|I work in HVAC  for 25 years. This is a better solution than converting to 134a. Works great. I've used similar products on commercial equipment
B002R109DS|5|These were for my grandson, he loved them
B002UYZ2MA|5|Cute color. Best gift to give.
B000CKQ2SC|5|As advertised.  Installed on my SRF racer.
B00EQ1IOS4|5|used it the second day, just in time. works great highly recommend this kit
B008CE06ZA|3|Just what I needed and at a fraction of the cost of other mfgs.
B001FAK28E|4|This product is great ONLY for when you have the doors removed from your vehicle.  Once the doors are put back on the passenger mirror is difficult to see
B00514ARUI|1|received back pad without mounting hardware
B007Z755KQ|4|This is great.  I did have a problem mounting it at first.  Just make sure you keep all bolts loose until you have everything together, otherwise you may run into issues getting it fully mounted.  It looks great and works great just mounting can be somewhat a bear until you figure out the secret (which is actually pretty simple)
B00F3XK8M4|2|Seems flimsy, guess you get what you pay for
B00EGXSO00|3|not the best quality but you get what you pay for and it isn't an exact fit for our 04 CRF
B003NZ9DFC|2|Nice looking product but cheep gloves n googles
B00T372T64|5|Great price fits well, the holes in the flange where the muffler bolts up are bigger than the oem hardware bolts so you'll have to use a bigger washer so it doesn't pull through. Also you will need a 1-3/4&#34; exhaust clamp because the pipe is a 2 piece slip pipe.
B009GN2DQQ|5|BOUGHT FOR MY HUSBAND WHO IS REFURBUSING A 67 CHEVY AND HAS NOT USED IT YET BUT HE SAID IT WAS PERFECT
B00VNBDWPK|4|The lights work great. The only issue is for the 2 LEDs to face the sides, not up and down, I had to modify one of the 3 tabs and cannot fully seat the bulb.
B002LCD9XU|4|Good sticker wish it was bigger
B001P1YAFO|5|It looked flimsy when I opened up the box.  However, once placed on my Lexus, it looked great.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B0081S9HJS|5|Good
B00852684M|3|They don't last, but at least they are cheap.
B000CMCNJC|5|great product!  no issues!
B00EDFYYX2|2|This was stated to fit my '06 Scion Xb but it didn't. I had to pull the insert out fit it to the existing mountings. This did solve the problem of needing a new wiper but it didn't fit as described.
B00WKR58CQ|5|Perfect fit...nice running board.
B001GJ3ECA|5|Cool little wheel cleaner. It really helps brush off a lot of the brake dusts before washing.
B003VASR9C|1|The holes did not match the holes in my trailer's frame. Had to bend and adjust the bracket to be able to get the jack attached to the trailer.<br />I thought this was easier than drilling new holes in the frame of my trailer. The holes in the jack were about 1/4&#34; off.
B0091PAFMI|5|I have not recieved the two OSHA books yet but read the rviews offered and I think they will be very useful. Our Employees really like the Fire Gone Extingushers we handed out to them during our Summer Picnic, very practicle.
B00D3E1E28|3|At first, I didn't even know if my car had a cabin air filter.  I didn't see anything regarding changing a cabin air filter on the maintenance schedule nor did I see any type of sticker in my car indicating that I have one.  I know my car does have the capability to have one put in (as I read about other people with the same car changing their cabin filters).  As it turns out the cabin air filter was an optional item.  I decided to take out the glove box compartment to see if I have one.  When I opened the cover, I found that I had no cabin air filter, and the fan that's inside was quite dusty as a result.  I decided to look for a cabin filter to put in.  I was initially thinking about trying a cheap filter, but I decided to try this more expensive filter to find out how they perform.<br /><br />I have only driven my car a few times with this installed, so this is more an initial impression than a comprehensive review.  First thing I noticed is that the filter doesn't fit in snugly.  I noticed that the competing Fram filter comes with foam strips that you can stick on for a better fit.  I think I'll give the Fram filter a try the next time to see if it fits more snugly.  As I never had a cabin air filter before, I had to figure out which direction the air flows (goes down in my case) so that I put the filter in with the arrow pointing down.  When I first turned the fan on, the air smells like a tree.  If you cut a fresh branch and take off the bark, that's what it smells like.  I guess that must be the smell from the polyphenol layer?  After a few days there's still that faint smell.  I personally prefer to have no scent in my air, but I guess that scent will eventually go away?<br /><br />My main objective for getting the cabin air filter was to reduce dust and odor.  Even though I haven't had the filter for long, I noticed that my interior has a lot less dust, so I know it's working.  Another positive about the Mann filter is that I didn't really notice a reduction in air flow (as compared to having no air filter), so that's good.  The filter doesn't get rid of odors, but it does certainly reduce it.  There's this one area I drive by that has a sewage-like smell, and obviously w/o the filter I smell it every time I pass there.  With the Mann filter, I noticed that the smell is much more faint.  I think a better test would be if I drove pass all those dairy farms in central California to see how well it does in reducing odor, but I have no business trips planned down in Southern California at the moment or the near future.<br /><br />The only unknown right now is how long this filter will last.  Perhaps I'll post an update after a year.
B009E6MMUC|4|Fits perfectly, doesn't fall down.  Much better than the cheap items you purchase at the store.  I am very happy with it.  Only downside was it did take quite a while to arrive.
B003H220TC|5|Fantastic!
B0040HA9Y6|5|works great
B00IE11Z9M|4|This is a great-looking, nice helmet. Love the removable chin bar and the drop down sun visor. I ordered an XL, which is usually a safe bet for me; however, there is a piece of the hard foam interior that sticks out and was badly irritating my forehead. This section was only about 1 inch by 1/2 inch and I ended up using a Dremel tool to grind it down and now it fits perfectly.
B00X32LTT8|5|I have to say that I think the suction on this product is perfectly fine for its price. I smoke cigarettes in my car so I have a lot of ashes everywhere. I really like the convenience of having this tool in the backseat, ready to keep my car as clean as possible. There are a few different hoses and modes you can use to get the best clean. If you're trying to get your car absolutely spotless, then sure, maybe you'll want to look for a vacuum that's $100 or so. This one works well for its price and I'm happy to have it. I received the product at a discount in exchange for an honest review and I plan to continue to use it!
B00LC8ZGQM|5|They work as intended
B009DJKUZE|5|Packaged exceptionally well, received quickly and met expectations!
B0026Y81VS|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Fits my 2014 F-150 SuperCrew (5.5 bed) perfectly. Easy to install (less than 20 minutes), and really strong once in place. The system is basically two rails and a header that aline along the sides & front of the truck bed, then a bar snaps into place at the ned (near the tail gate) to secure it when closed. Very positive and strong connections. The rails are held in place by metal clamps (3 on each side). The instructions say the clamps should be positioned in a way that I couldn't quite get to, but it's working fine with what I could do. The top feels snug and has 2 cross bar supports that span the width of the bed, but I wouldn't put anything heavy on top. I would say it's probably nearly water/weather sealed, and the sides rest on top of the truck bed structure with weather stripping that conformed to the contours of the bed. It opens easily and rolls all the way to fully expose the bed if needed. The also provide extra weather stripping material if you need it. Best part - I've improved my MGP by an average of 3. On a road trip (mostly freeway driving), I was over 19 MPG where I was averaging around 16. Side street driving, I'm averaging around 18.5 where before I was around 15.5.
B009FUF6DM|1|Scratched my lenses.
B003TPGKJ8|5|Great stuff for my solid tappit engine.  Fast shipping and good price.
B0041G3VQE|5|Thick leather, great quality, fits my 6'1&#34; 190lbs frame. Liner works to 45+ degree weather. Any colder and I had to put Cold Gear on under the coat. In the 112 degree desert weather it breathes good. Being hot is expected in that hot of Nevada desert. Thanks for a great product!
B00E16M1S8|5|Fits well in my 2007 Prius.  Holds a strong charge.
B008LUXKEE|2|Cheap material.
B00C5RBRA8|4|Haven't used it yet but no fought it will work
B00QWHH6BQ|4|Mirrors fit well they have a longer stem witch I needed for the new bars on the bike nice mirrors !
B009XCYSIQ|4|Easy to use and clean.  Results were better than I expected for my first truck paint job.  A great product at a great price with good results.  I am very happy.
B00CM0Q38O|5|good price time will tell how long they will last
B005RNGN8I|4|This is a great problem solver.  Took the stripes off a 1988 truck with little effort.  Looks like it will last a few more projects.  Time saver as well
B0049L2M16|1|I purchased and installed two of these hubs in november of 2013, on my 2004 Dodge Pickup.  One of the hubs is already failing.  First, i went to Amazon, to find out about a warrantee. They said to contact Raybestos, which I did.  (Your Raybestos contact options are: send an email, and someone will get back to you in the near future?!?,  or call tech support.)   The tech support person said that when purchased, thru Amazon or Rock crawler, that these companies handle the warrantee.  (Quote: They buy from us, you buy from them.)  I chatted with Amazon to find out what to do, and they said that they do not handle warrantees.  So there you go.  I'm going  to NAPA Auto Parts down the street, and buy a new hub.
B00684TAYY|5|Very easy to use I love it
B001HIGYVI|5|This is closest I could find the the kit I purchased on ECSTuning. I'm leaving this review as not a lot of automotive sites allow you to leave reviews for some reason. These are well worth every penny. I can see now why some people will rip out the stock suspension & install Bilstein, even in a brand new vehicle. I got these installed on an '04 VW Jetta at the beginning of this year & they are holding up extremely well to the harsh New Jersey roads. I have had no issues & no complaints. I've put several thousand miles on them already & they are rock solid. I can't recommend them enough. I'm unsure which springs this particular kit listed comes with, but I paired mine with NEUSPEED springs as I wanted to lower my vehicle as little as possible.<br /><br />I cannot recommend these enough. They are an absolutely great suspension setup.
B00BH3Q1R0|4|Love it for my beer fridge in the game room. Wish it was larger, but thats my fault for not checking to see how big it was. Nice quality, not blurred at all.
B00AF2I01Y|5|Great tough material. Would buy again.
B001L9KI56|5|A little too loose on the grips but still works.
B004H78NQ0|5|They are what they are. Look good on my BMW and I've gotten a couple compliments as well.
B003G9FQSS|3|Never did get it to work but long to load up trading the camper that was being put in
B0040CTYAQ|5|Good.
B004JCE9E8|5|Fit perfectly in my 2011 Sonata Limited.
B000CM2VLC|5|Fit perfect. Arrived fast.
B0035RZ280|5|Arrived very quick.  Worked as advertised.
B001C5Y4FE|5|Heavy-duty  works great so far no rattles.
B001DRNNKI|4|It works great in our 2007 GTI. I no longer have allergies in the car!
B0068ERNNE|3|Just used this on my way back from Sturgis, SD.  Rode about 2.5 hours or so with it on.  Pants legs too short for me, with an inseam of 34&#34;.  Otherwise pants good, and effective in keeping the rain out.  The jacket neck was too tight/small for me when I velcro'd it closed, and would not stay fastened.  .  Sleeve length good (35&#34; is my shirt sleeve length).  Again, kept the rain out and me dry, though my road king has a windscreen which helps I think.  The next size up would have been too big, as for the most part the suit is generously sized.
B003ZOF09Y|5|Replaced original installation with complete success and satisfaction. Recommend to all.
B000C11JIY|5|Excellent  quality & price
B00826OVWW|5|Bought as a gift for my father. He absolutely loves it. Easy to put together and easy to use. Was shipped in the next two days with free shipping, WOW! Overall we love it!
B00WTKZHQG|5|fit good
B00DODJ9AM|5|love it
B009IFIETM|5|Product as described.
B00E8CV0EQ|4|I received this, but can't really give it a review because I haven't used it.  However, I feel safer now that my car has one in case of an emergency.  Thank you!
B00L7FC9JW|5|The size is okay with my '11 VW GTI.  The side window shade is kind of small, but I understand it is made as universal fit.  The included suction cups are commodity grade PVC and will deteriorate eventually.  But I am glad that this kind of side window and back window shade is available.
B002IV4KFA|4|info on drill size and mounting info woold have herped
B00BVB5HFA|5|Worked perfect!!!
B00W8LRJFI|1|one was missing the adheasive. what a waste. knew it was too good to be true.
B00CM589B8|1|The picture showed it was thick when i got it.. it was really really thin. did not look anything like the picture and it did not even have the brand name microtex on it.
B00E9BE444|3|Received my 2014 Nissan Titan tail light Chrome Bezals and, tried to install the right rear one, but, had to replace a section of 3M double-sided mounting tape under the upper, right side, leading edge corner with some slightly wider, new, 3M tape, and, it mounted &#34;almost&#34; perfectly.  Overall, I am satisfied with the Chrome Bezels, (they are really beautiful, bright, and, shiny), but, I didn't receive any mounting instructions at all, and, I believe that had I received instructions, (good instructions), my mounting experience would have turned out much better, than it did.  p.s.  I also changed the 3M tape on the left rear tail light Chrome Bezel in the same area (the leading edge, upper left corner), and, it too, mounted very well.
B001KN0J2U|5|LOVE it love it
B00E9BECU0|4|Received and, mounted my new Chrome Bezels, for my 2014 Ram Big Horn.  They are definitely beautiful, bright, and, shiny.  The right rear Bezel mounted &#34;almost&#34; perfectly and, you really have to look at it real close to see the area that didn't fit (the right side, outer edge)!  The left side, didn't mount nearly as well as the right side did, but, again, it still looks very good (from a distance of 6 to 8 feet away, or, so).  I received all of my Chrome trim products (tail light Bezels, and, 3rd brake light covers (for my 2014 Titan, and, for my 2014 Ram Big Horn, 2 to 3 days earlier than expected.  Thanx!).  Once again, I didn't receive any instructions for mounting any of my Chrome accessories, for either of my vehicles, hence the 4 stars rating, versus, 5 stars???
B00AAHOXWE|5|Does the trick
B002UXT3NU|5|Nice and usefull
B00XULVDHK|2|Poorly made.
B0025QAESA|5|All I can say is &#34;COOL!!!&#34; Ordered on 8/7, delivered today 8/10, took 15 minutes to install (let my 15 y/o son do it) and wife's rear air conditioning is working again!!! Product box says &#34;Wells&#34; but product is actually a Denso and, other than a date sticker, is identical to the OEM I replaced!
B00UNPAR50|5|Used it to install a mini-split system.  I'm not an HVAC technician.  Just a DYI kind of person.  It worked perfectly.
B00PU8HUUK|5|they worked perfect and my bike looks alot better
B000CAINDE|5|Fits nicely in my 2014 Optima! Does the job well
B00V9Z11WG|1|didnt like them, they looked cool but didnt work on my bike
B00S7RZX28|4|It's a plug
B00826OVWW|4|This little creeper is a great buy for the price.  We have had no issues using it.  It would not be great for a heavier person to use as it is a little bit flimsy - but you get what you pay for.... and as I said, we have had no issues and have had it for 2 years.
B007KNALPE|5|I have installed these on my 93 z28 with HIDS an I must say these projectors a very good the cut off is magnificent compared to what I use to have an the LEDS are bright at night with the lights off. They a very big lights better than I thought they would be. Lol about  the size of a baby watermelon
B00JPBHLYI|5|Quick shipment no complaints
B001EOV492|5|I think I would have got the longer one if I had to do it again, but this one works great!
B009LZUJRY|5|Exactly the right part for the appplication stated.  Matched perfectly.  Cost was about 1/3 less than purchasing it at one of the local auto parts stores.
B008BMQYGI|5|Just perfect!  I love it!
B0041LN1L4|5|Keeps non-drivers off my ass!
B001KVW6EQ|5|Great idea
B00L319NYY|5|I'm extremely impressed by the mats. It fits my Kia Optima 2013 EX like a glove, even the footrest is covered. It's a perfect match and the black color blends in nicely with my grey leather interior. Love the texture and look. Looks very sturdy and well built and hopefully it'll last for many years to come. Time will tell.
B005E4OYFE|5|Have a couple pairs of these to add color to whatever my mood may be while riding. Thor offer great quality at reasonable prices. I have nothing bad to say about Thor Enemy goggles and the company I ordered them through.<br />Definitely will buy again as colors and designs fit my style. Thor is undeniably one of the best out there and a go to for the basics of what's needed.
B00KTIUI9Q|5|Great product! Remember to program ALL of your key fobs at once because your old ones will not work unless you do them all at the same time!
B0036C0PVI|5|Great product for masking off an area, such as when cleaning or restoring headlight lens.
B0043G83YW|1|The Key Chain looked elegant, exactly as in picture. But, it broke within a week. The attachment between the ring and the 'Lexus' stick part broke, and there's no way to repair it. Sad, as the piece was really pretty.
B004A663QK|4|Works as expected.  No installation issues, except who wants to work on a car?  Most likely is the original manufacturer of the factory parts anyway.  Plus they're cheaper on Amazon.
B001UOOY02|4|Perfect fit no issues what so ever!!
B002JBDH26|5|great buy
B00ID2P60Q|3|A good replacement, but it does not snap back together as tightly as the original manufacturer product, no matter how hard you hit it. I'm concerned that water will accidentally get in and ruin the interior component. The buttons are also a little harder to press because they sit farther down in the button openings. If you are looking for a cost effective replacement, this is still sufficient!
B00BCRMBGQ|2|They look nice, but aren't very great quality not, even a week and one started ripping. And they are not easy to install! But for that price they're fine, beggars can't be choosers.
B000B8JUNY|5|Hey it's a gas cap.  It does the job it was supposed to do.
B001C6NL52|3|I have a set I purchased several years ago and they are great.<br />This set however on several of the smaller sockets the stem is to big and will not allow the socket to drop into place.<br />Some of the real small sizes are completely unreadable as to what size is supposed to be in that position.
B0009IQXFO|5|My favorite car wash.  Follow the directions and use the proper amount.
B00DT7S74W|5|I am 6'2 200 lbs 42 in waist I followed the sizing directions and got a large they fit GREAT,The leather is soft and supple and I'm sure will break in even better with time,They are comfortable while riding and don't ride up your legs they look great with the braided design. I would highly recommend these for any rider and the price is right for sure,I can't speak on the durability yet but will update the review if necessary,For now 5 stars is a fair rating,Price value and fit I recommend these for my fellow Amazon members.
B00QPV8B22|5|These are nice because they are compact and small - not one of those big long ones that take up half the backseat haha!  I haven't had a chance to use these yet because it's August!  But I will update later on after our crazy Ohio winters with how they held up in the snow.  I think I'll like them, but I'm not sure yet! :)
B00BG7K7E0|5|Great service, great product. Thank you.
B00LW834Z2|2|Can't get them cut any where
B001KSGF14|5|Works great! It was delivered the same day, and only took about 10 minutes to install in my Chevy Suburban. This part, and a Youtube video, saved me from a $300 repair. Yay!
B00FBPGY7C|5|Good quality
B00XQKQ5O6|3|The kit seemed of great quality. However it did not fit my truck. It said it fit TUNDRA 2007-2015. It does not fit on a 2015. The holes on the upper strut mount can not line up no matter what you do. I did a little reaserch and it will only fit up to 2012 model year
B00K2EVJ9U|4|good job !
B000EVRK8K|5|Awesome!!!!!!!!!!
B004AIFLMU|5|Worked perfect, saved a ton. Five stars.
B00D1CQVIY|1|Not at all happy the wire system stopped working after about 4 weeks uninstalled and tossed into the trash never buying this company again.
B00R1FUYCG|5|unit came quickly, with insrtuctions and works well.
B000G72UOQ|5|Ordered for 2012 Chrysler Van.  This one fits.  If I leave the back wing windows open with these shades in place it actually feels cooler than outside.  It has been miserable for the last few weeks in Austin, Tx.  Over a hundred every day and this is a life saver.  Thanks
B009K9DBUS|5|Excellent product and even better service.
B00OFQ5JH4|5|Very good product easy to apply looks awesome
B00G3Z0V6O|5|perfect fit, great price, great shipping.
B00MI2GHU0|5|Installed these on my 05 Civic. Worked out great. I really didn't have any fitment problems with any of the parts, but did have to persuade the ball joints to work out. Over all these where great products.
B00SQTXW3Y|5|The suit works perfectly!! Great buy for the money
B000C2WD6K|5|Good quality form fitting product!
B009DJOUIM|5|Excellent
B007OUXGNC|5|Awesome, can't wait to put it on my truck!
B00SXB3AL4|5|It looks good and is a great size for my Xterra some of the prevoius stickers I had looked at were not big enough for my larger vehicle
B00429NKWK|5|Works as advertised. You have to take care and follow the instructions. Takes some elbow grease but well worth the effort.<br />My 2003 Camry headlights look like new. I'm impressed.
B00T53VFWU|5|Very satisfied with the product.
B002ZBWKAU|5|very convenient and efficient.
B00IZNZOYQ|5|Fits perfectly and does the job without damage to the housing.
B005OZNRVK|5|Took it to a locksmith to have it programmed and it worked fine.
B00I44VY86|5|Assemblies worked great.. really good value!
B00904WS84|4|The large are in the small side.....
B00QXDF3LE|1|Description of the product does not indicate its size.  IT IS A TINE STICKER...
B000KZ0E3S|5|Worked great, as long as you following the direction correctly.
B00CUECFZM|4|Looks as good as the original Honda part.
B0041K13LA|2|Worthless
B00M8M5LWK|5|I found this lanyard to be exactly what I wanted it to be. Very nice design and my favorite brand. Diamond supply ❤️❤️
B000BYGDI8|1|My truck has the black module so from everything I read, this one should work fine. Wrong! Truck started and idled fine but was totally undriveable. Installed an OEM module and that worked perfectly.  To bad because I was hoping for a little more performance and maybe fuel economy. Amazon refunded my money no questions asked.
B005Q87X3I|4|Easy to install on my 2010 terrain
B00AZP87NW|5|Great experience part was exact
B0050SKSSG|5|I used three of these, two to mount a lighted license plate bracket and one to mount a cell phone antenna to the two inch roll bar cage on my UTV.  They worked perfectly for my application.
B000C9IRPE|5|I bought this starter for a 85 Chevy caprice,  fit just perfect and works great
B002NIKTAI|5|Perfect fit! Excellent coverage and protection. It does cut down on the heat in the car and keeps the sun off the upholstery, dashboard and steering wheel.  Good material and well made. Velcro tie and easy to stow. Reasonably priced and exactly what I was looking for. Would, definitely, purchase this again.
B00GKOQA3G|5|Worked as advertised
B00SKYYI2O|5|For the price this is absolutely amaxing. Very easy, practically idiot proof to install.
B001DCWML4|5|Parts were great quality.  Bolted up easily. Pretty satisfied with the product.
B000BO8Z9I|4|Great shipping. Polished 25 year old rims almost like new.
B000C9HMN2|4|Kit was missing the parking brake adjuster strut springs-I had to use the old ones-other than that is is a good kit
B0016ZBP1Q|5|Great product
B000YS13FO|5|I have size6 wide feet so I had to use a shoe insert because they fit a bit big but the insert made them fit snug...I Luv Them!... Delivery On Time & Great to do Business With! ツ
B000NUBKGK|5|Excellent
B0039H66U4|4|Was easy to install match interior perfect an has great sound quality with factory radio not sure it could stand a lot of power but for the price met my expectations
B008OYAFH2|5|works great
B009B9G9LK|3|Fits perfect, so much that you have to move rear view mirror to get them in place, but very bulky. My kids have to walk over them all the time. Too big of a pain to store them in the back. Wouldn't buy again. Plus they are very hot when you take them down. Hard to fold super hot.
B00HQCJNKI|5|EXCELLENT
B007EEU58W|5|A+, very durable and easy to install.
B00JI24VOM|1|It ran better with the old one
B0086JI9VO|2|I was disappointed they were not the bright handicapped blue. What I received were more of a navy blue.
B00FGXEDTK|5|love the switches they work awesome
B008I1YO50|5|installed in minutes
B00D38PFBA|5|Good for the price
B00AYXM4DY|1|Horrible product - rip off sale.
B003ZX4GJU|5|These are my go to goggles. Came with extra sense which is fantastic in case there is an incident while riding. I absolutely love the design and I get the best compliments while wearing them. I feel incredibly protected in these. I've ridden in mud, dirt, sand, you name it! Rocks haven't damaged these bad boys yet! I could not recommend Thor goggles more! They definitely give you security while riding. The set up is nice and the comfortability level is top of the line.<br />The strap stays put and never gets larger unexpectedly. I love having the soft gel on the strap that keeps it from sliding on the helmet as well.<br />Thor is my go to motocross brand because there is undeniable quality in all of their products, but I especially find it in their goggles. I own a handful of Thor goggles and different varieties, but I would say that although they are all good, the Hero goggles are the most comfortable and sturdy out of the bunch. I am never left doubting or questioning durablilty, capability, or quality. You will not regret purchasing these to have around.
B000AA8UAC|5|Wouldn't buy any other brand.
B00WFHVXD4|1|Doesn't really seem to do much of ANYTHING, certainly not anywhere near the advertisement claims. Mileage MAY have gone up a very minor 1-2 mpg but its hard to be sure. No performance value at all.
B00GXRF80Q|1|3m tape will not hold
B00UO4EBYS|4|Happy with the product.
B000X1Y642|5|Great product
B000C32J40|5|Excellent service/prices
B0006BC7OU|5|Exactly what I wanted. Very good cover.
B000WEKQ3K|5|Returned as didn't fit my car
B00Z9U24S2|4|Good solid cap.  But did not fit my kids bike.
B00YW6GM50|5|So far so good! The product works as described. I'm more concerned with longevity. Need a quality product that can go the distance. Only time will tell.
B00192JGDU|5|Compact, lightweight for size and easily portable. Works perfectly for me.
B00BTSN3T2|5|Great quality and price with easy to follow online programming instructions. Thanks!
B006YU7G8E|5|Good price, does the job. It's hard to find this fluid where I live. Luckily Amazon has it for a good price.
B00JIIZCM6|4|great stuff!
B002R1097O|5|These were for my grandson he loved them
B00032KBFE|5|Worked like a champ. 2nd time I have purchased this product and it is just as described
B002LKJD7S|5|Parts fit perfectly. Solved my problem 100%.It helped to read tips about the installation on the reviews.
B00XZ9OO7S|5|As noted: YOU MUST HAVE PROGRAMMING PERFORMED BY TECHNICIAN. Unlike my Trailblazer, this remote's programming requires access to the vehicle body control module. Some locksmiths can perform this task for you also. Make sure you bring all the remotes you use with the vehicle at the time of programming also.
B00O3N4V7I|5|Excellent product.
B00VW8W40I|5|Exactly what it looks like in the pic it comes in one piece but you can cut it to space out the words and it sticks on nice no hassle
B00BYA38NQ|5|I was able to press the old bushings out and press these bushings in with no problems. So far they work great!
B00L2PRN2K|1|It didn't last long
B005SB6RUI|4|Good price, sturdy. Seems a little difficult to tension both of the arms evenly.  It tows well, and does even out the weight distribution.
B00VKZY5LO|5|Great purchase! Great price! Quick delivery!
B0022XI4NS|5|Easy installation - good fit on Road King.
B00INY5Q6I|5|Took a little bit to install it without help but worked out great in the long run.
B00BIQXA2K|5|The smell lasts a good while! Awesome!
B006GJMMEG|5|These give the perfect amount of lift for a great level to my jeep
B00NJ9MZH0|5|Good quality, and fast delivery!
B00HRMSZ3S|5|Brighter than stock lights.  License plate and trunk lights are very nice and bright.  Clean temperature of light.
B00CE3OYA8|5|Not everything that was pictured was in the kit, you actually get the main two bushings. Nonetheless well worth the money and excellent fit.
B008G23AUQ|5|Installed great. The clips on the 98 Ranger are a huge pain and I had to buy two replacement clips on Amazon as well.
B002JR949K|2|Look pretty cheap and my opinion is that they are not broad enough to be of any decent use...
B0017OFS3C|5|Worked for license plate light replacement in my 2008 Toyota Prius. AND I was even able to install it myself, following along from a youtube video - it really was super easy - and on a 1-10 scale of my car maintenance abilities, I'd give myself a 1.5. I also didn't even chip my nails or break anything on my car putting them in, so bonus! My oil change place couldn't even change them (as you have to remove a whole planel inside the hatchback), and the Toyota dealership quoted $125 to change them - so 6 bucks and 20 minutes of my time was a steal!!
B00D6N0VW0|5|Part was shipped within hours of order and was exactly what I needed. I'm glad I paid a good price, and was able to get the car back running. Thanks for making my project smooth.
B00QGA5OCM|5|Very nice
B008XB9BJY|5|These were bought as replacement bulbs for my RV.  I like to camp off the grid and the original lights that came with the RV use up way too much battery power so I am hoping these will work much better.  The color and brightness are very close to the original, which is what I was looking for.
B00J3DFW3A|5|Its great, just perfect for my suburban!
B006X8BATI|4|Fits, easier to use zip ties to fasten.
B00OJN8E5C|5|Arrived way ahead of expected date - looks great on my truck.
B00CC2ZBIU|5|Great item. Had no issues installing it into my 2014 Honda Civic Si. I purchased the 6000 and they are perfect brightness. Would buy again
B00O0SRAK6|2|I Have had this for a week and two of the lights are all ready not working
B004N81D4C|5|excellent very happy purchase
B001R5Q380|5|quick delivery and great fit!
B00GKCE058|4|Really well done. Like that it is script.<br /> Wish it had the Maserati logo and screws<br />For installation
B00RV46YBC|3|Good light power but make sure you lightly glue to stock light harness on sides by hold tabs..if you got a Magnum...they are not aggressive enough to lock in
B00KGIE5AC|4|Not going to comment, ordered it for someone else. It fits but was a bit off which I think was our fault.  It's in use is all I can say about that.
B00REJXONK|4|Looks good only one flaw is at the top of bed it does not lay flat
B00GX3141C|3|Fair. A bit wavy even before installing.
B000EQPBLS|5|Good
B0002MA3OE|4|Good Deal!
B00O2FJFSM|5|Brackets work well on RZR S
B00684TAYY|3|It locks and unlocks doors but does not let you control the horn function that should be able to be controlled by pressing lock and unlock at same time.
B000IOO4DM|5|I cannot say enough good things about these peg mounts. My bike does not have crash bars, so long trips were pretty uncomfortable. I installed these along with some Kuryakyn pegs and just took an 1100 mile trip. It helped tremendously!!!!<br /><br />Please read the description carefully:<br /> - You will need to drill holes in your floorboard<br /> - These are mounts only and do not include pegs
B0002X2MZQ|4|just what I needed
B009DJM8EU|5|Fit perfectly. Excellent quality.
B001C9OWW0|5|Fit and rides like OEM
B0031BQRVG|3|needs to have dimensions listed better
B00D8DR0AO|5|I'm amazed at what an ounce of this stuff did in one washing.  My car was sparkling and looked like I had waxed it too.  When it rained, it beaded up like crazy.  I live in an apartment and wasn't satisfied with the job the local car washes were doing, especially for the price they were charging,  and needed something that I could wash my car with myself.  It was easy to do and did such a great job on the windows that I am going to try it on my apartment windows when I wash them the next time.
B00AZFZGMC|4|works fine
B000C7S4NG|5|MZ7A Tank came with send unit gskt and screws and fit perfectly. 92 B2200 extra cab w/carb loves it's new fuel source. As rusty as the old tank was.I didn't consider the send unit was affected. I did have to buy new send unit after tank install from another source. Looked up fitment on manf website and typed in part no on Amazon as part of price comparison. Amazon won this time. Pkg (box) was ripped a small amount but no damage to tank inside. Don't forget undercoating for shiny new tank to keep it from rusting.
B001UAB7VA|5|Amazing! Just to test it I tried spraying a piece of newspaper with  it, and after it dried I poured water on it. It managed to waterproof newspaper!
B008YZGB7Y|5|Delivered as expected. Very nice helmet.
B00P9W8NLW|5|Works great. Have used it with engine oil and transmission fluid. Both fluids were WARM (30 min or so engine off) and the little pump flowed it pretty quickly. No idea how it flows cold oils. Due to plastic composite of pump and hoses I do not recommend trying to pump HOT fluids.
B00MLI6Q5W|3|Great light very bright they could use a little better wireing instructions
B004P9A35E|5|Works great!
B000C4PM7A|5|A+A+A
B002UC4XM2|5|Looked for one of these for a while, fits my RV sink perfectly
B00U3BJEEE|5|Jeep looks great.  Already getting compliments.
B00EOVM91O|5|Excellent experience
B00QYBSO66|5|For a wireless device it works great!
B0025YODAC|5|Absolutely love this jacket. Was looking for a mesh jacket for summer riding because I live Arizona and my other jacket it just too hot to wear. I bought this one because it had so many reviews specifically from people in Arizona and Texas. It has met all my expectations. I did return the first one they sent me because the left sleeve was slightly larger than the right even with the strap pulled down evenly on both sides. Not a huge deal but it drove me nuts. Had no issues returning it and ordered a second one. This one fits like it should. No complaints. It's even comfortable to wear when it's 105. Highly recommended!!
