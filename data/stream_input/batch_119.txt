B00940KFXO|5|I got this for a friends little girl that is a big &#34;Princess&#34; fan.  She loves the drama of the skirt
B00IE3HEO0|5|Very nice looking
B004TLVK5A|5|This product is high quality and it is quite stylish too, but make sure you have small glasses. It will not fit big glasses
B0041RITZG|1|As \\"Tuk\\" said in his review these have very thin clamps that need constant tweeking, plus the jaws are NYLON, which is so slippery that it was impossible to sit down without at least one coming loose, and that's with the adjustment all the way loose, so my cuffs dragged, and I am only 5'9\\",  I returned these and found some that have a great feel, and nice heavy steel clamps made by Docker's, Stlye number 21DK5302, which at JC Penney's store they had them in Navy, Black and Khaki (JCPENNY.com seems to have them only in black).  Warning -- all other Docker's styles had ... you guessed it --- NYLON JAWS!!!!  Just how stupid is it to use a materiel that is used as a bearing surface to hold up pants???
B00TG2JYFA|4|It's a super cute bathing suit and the bottoms fit perfectly, but the top was way too small. I'm a very chesty lady, and I almost needed to buy two suits...one to fit my bottoms and one to fit my top.
B00AJYY896|5|I love my hat would like to get more  of them in different colors love the brim
B002080B7W|5|This is the most comfortable nursing bra I have found. It actually fits and doesn't cut into my rib cage like others. I'm pretty big: 38J, so this one did the trick.
B000KK4HLI|5|These are comfortable and soft. I use these as pj's. Not a bad price for them too. They are not too short or anything like that. All in all, a great pair of shorts at a reasonable price.
B00J7LRG5U|5|amazing!!! i love  it!!!
B00P8ZXQZI|4|My daughter loved it
B00WZH1QHW|5|Great way to wear the Maryland flag a little more subtle.  These are very comfortable shorts
B00B3Y6J8O|5|Wore this for Thanksgiving dinner and received many compliments. Fit great and looked cute with a black tank-top camisole underneath with black jeggings and high wedge boots.
B00J3YFMZM|5|Love this shirt.  It is EXACTLY as pictured.  Only downside is, it's see through and won't leave much to the imagination but adorable!
B00X4GHB4A|5|Really can feel the love for 'MURICA pumping through my veins when I wear this hat. A++
B000UV3K4W|3|The small fits like a medium and the boot covers are a bit cheesy! However If you spend the extra mony you can get the real boots on Amazon!
B006B2RWNY|5|Fell in love with this shirt, so glad I made the purchase. Everytime I wear it I receive compliments, so sexy & beautiful. The front is simple and when you turn around it's such a stunning surprise to people. Just gorgeous, you won't regret buying it.
B00D7WFN5K|4|It was a little wider than expected but otherwise well worth the price. Clip has the right amount of tension.
B000TFOSOU|4|Fit was fine- roomy enough body-wise, plenty  long enough, but the sleeves a little short.
B00DV0G4CY|5|For the price it is perfect. I thought the fit is true to size. I am 5'5&#34; and a medium was the correct length just like in the picture.
B00F5YMV0S|5|Thanks for the shirt! Great fit!
B007EX9QA6|5|Shirts are very comfortable!
B000N8Q04Y|3|Not a whole lot to say here...it's a work shirt.  I was a little surprised because the gray was a lot darker in person than the photos.  The fabric is tough but the stitching is a little cheapo.  I already have a couple of threads haning off of the button holes.  I would have given it a higher rating but it's really not any better quality than the work shirts over at walmart for $10.
B006Z8HTV4|5|This is a beautiful shirt.  I love the fabric and material.  It's soft and comfy.  I will definitely be ordering more for the fall.
B000QWDQTE|2|I returned this after two days or wear because the rubber smell was so strong that I would get sever headaches.
B00OQ06UEA|5|Perfect fit, no fuss with receiving the order!
B005QSRYV4|5|I love these panties and the lace. Also, can't beat the price on these! My hubby loves them too. : )
B00E5PKDGM|5|Huge Misfits fan! True to size and super comfy shirt! Whenever I wear it I always get compliments on it!!!!
B007WWDTL6|5|These are well made and stay up. Has good cushioning and your feet stay warm and dry. I would recommend these.
B00HDY84EA|5|Very flattering fit
B00CUKV1VA|5|Excellent hat to wear if it is hard for you to witness for him.
B00K97NAMY|4|Thanks
B00T2WBJJ8|3|It's a little small around my hips and I wear a U.S. Size 10. I also did not realize that it has boning incorporated in it. Just makes it a bit hard to sit without the boning bending or dipping into my skin. Granted I have just worn it once. Overall good product. Since I have only worn it once I will give it an average score of 3
B009L5B05O|5|Fun shirt and just in-time for Halloween!  This shirt arrived on-time and with no issues to the product.  Everyone couldn't stop talking about it.  We told another friend of ours and she's having twins so she ordered the twins version of this shirt.. HAHA! Thanks!!!
B00H02ZDT4|1|I found this to be super awkward once place on my visor and therefore too distracting. I planned to return for refund but after they deduct the return shipping ($6.25) I would only recoup about 3 bucks. Not worth the hassle.
B009T9TJ78|5|great no problems, I would buy these again if I need collar stays hopefully I will not though in the future
B00UL6BH8W|5|very good
B009YQYDI6|4|So cute & comfortable<br />Lets you grow & feel sexy<br />I have been giving it as a gift to my closet girl friends & haven't had a complaint yet..
B00103IQP2|1|The color of the shipment was not what was ordered. My son was specific. When I gave this to him, he didn't want it. I emailed the seller and he never got back to me. We sold it at a garage sale.
B001BPVC82|5|I bought one for my granddaughter and bought another after a friend saw it.  Stays on the child head securely, but isn't being constantlty tugged on because it's very comfortable.  Would highly recommend it.
B005DT8BQI|4|This is really cute and even has Zeppelin art on the inside and none of the designs have rubbed off or faded at all (I've had it about two months) it holds everything I need it to. My only complaint is that when you open the part that holds the coins sometimes the coins fall out.
B00JUZZ2UY|5|Can't believe how fast this arrived! Fit perfectly! I'll order from this vendor again. Thank you!
B000UPP8CU|5|great scrubs
B003VKWJVO|4|Bought it as a present. A little bit large, but they loved it! Great for any literature or Vonnegut fans!
B008I5OW9E|1|There was no opening in the front.
B003N9BTFU|5|Bra fits great for me - I am actually a size 32D (almost impossible to find), but this bra in 34D on the tightest back clipping works perfect.  I love how this bra looks under T-shirts.  Nice form.
B00E5NC0IS|5|It was better than expected! A good size, well made.
B003ECQV7M|5|Great and comfortable fit!  I love it!
B001H0FCBY|5|I have worn these gloves for years and absolutely love them.  They are not too bulky but fit snuggly and hold in the warmth of your hands.  However if you are working or playing in the rain or snow they are not waterproof.
B00BB3DF3E|5|Just as advertised.<br />PROS: Easy to read, clean and durable. Easy to wash too.Great convo starter<br />CONS: None.<br /><br />Will buy more for my guys and their Firing Range Shirts
B00U6VTH7U|3|sent back didn't need two
B00BWYCRPO|5|Love these.  I got so many compliments.  They ran small. I got a medium and typically I wear size 1-2.
B0013MRWN2|1|I found it very uncomfortable and did not fit well at all.
B00JARYKCI|4|Not bad for the price. This is a basic no frills design. It is ever so slightly smaller than others I have purchased making it necessary to slightly have to trim most retaining tabs for replacement plastic inserts. My guess is that this will pretty well  if not better than most at this price point. It had lots of card slots that were wide enought to get cards in and out much easier than other wallets I have purchased. I recommend this product and would buy again.
B004IVGVDM|5|I ordered Spanx, Assets by Sara Blakely, and L'eggs Profiles Firm Control Capri. For the money, the L'eggs product was much better.
B002R1OMOA|4|Real double locking hand and leg cuffs. Good quality. Only real con is that they are on the smaller side. Other than that a great deal and find!
B00R4K5QJE|5|Very nice in person
B00D85Z75C|5|Best socks ever. I started walking on a treadmill and had blisters on top of blisters. Bought 4 different pairs of shoes ranging from cheap to expensive and was still getting blisters finally a store employee told me about these socks. They prevent the slippage that was causing the blisters.
B008KFJ5U8|1|ordered size 32 and got size 32/28 they are way to short. cant wear them. dont buy this
B002OTQXBU|5|This hat is SOOOO cute! Cuter than I anticipated, fabric is better quality than I thought. And it sits so cute, sort of sinks down over tops of both ears and snug around the forehead like a little charleston-type look, i just love it! Its different and versatile with either jeans or something like a casual dress/skirt.  The grey and blue are actually very easy to match also. Great buy!
B000LNHFG8|4|We used this in our mime show on our faces to make sure that our hats and hair did not get face paint on it, and it worked!
B009K7U3L0|5|This thing was so useful when doing security detail at night time and hid my face in low lighting situations. It was also good for winter time and is still durable and warm for that much material.
B003HG6GWU|5|Awesome hat, if you are looking for something cheap and good for your mad hatter outfit. I have a med-large head and it fitted fine, the hat itself is huge.<br /><br />Just a warning though, without a jacket and the rest of the outfit it's a fine line between mad hatter and drunk Irishman.
B002J670JM|1|This product was crap. The wings came balled up in a box after unwrapping them the fabric was all shredded, you could see the pattern lines because whomever made it did not follow the pattern at all. Most of it is hot glued together or with terrible stitching. They DO NOT look like the picture above. I could have made this myself for cheaper!
B00D628VS2|5|Great belt for my 8 year old. She loves it.
B000SKNYAU|5|These socks fit perfectly, even after the wash. They are comfortable, soft and keep your feet cool. A great buy!
B00S1N5LAC|5|Love it..!
B00DMEVJSS|4|The shirt fit as expected...the girls loved them...I am going to order more in different colors...I would recommend this purchase.
B00EXLJ1V6|5|I would recommend that if you have any doubts and like me, are tall, to order a size up. But I love the design, they're super comfortable, and I now own 3 pair.
B00CAXOEOI|4|I'm always one for a bargain, and I'm not hung up on labels.  As long as it works, who cares if it's a tiger, a crocodile, a pony or a puppy as an insignia?  Who even needs an insignia?  Insignias are insignificant (I just made that up!).  I bought a bargain brand of undershirts, figuring that an undershirt is an undershirt, right?  So long as I'm saving a couple of bucks, who cares if it's a capital-N name brand or just a name brand?<br /><br />Well, I now care.  At least so far as my undershirts are concerned.<br /><br />The other undershirts that I bought may have been cheaper but they were far inferior to the Hanes tagless undershirts.  The collars of the bargain brand hugged my neck and the cotton material didn't allow for any - I don't know - breathing.  They were the most uncomfortable t-shirts I ever bought.<br /><br />The Hanes tagless undershirts are made of supersoft cotton that gets softer with each washing.  The neckline never chokes and the sizing is perfect.<br /><br />Plus, Michael Jordan wears Hanes tagless.  If they're good enough for His Airness they're good enough for me.
B00910USX4|4|The material is super soft!  But it is also made of a fake material that doesn't breathe, so if you wear it anywhere slightly warm you sweat.<br /><br />Also, I'm 5'1(and a half :D )  I barely fit, so if your any taller I would recommend going up a size.
B00NWNFYJY|1|Wow beautiful dress however was too small.  So got get and look for different dress
B008U7KRIA|5|i brought this for my husband and he says he loves these. He said they are longer than most. He said they are a little more but well worth it.
B00GTXUSRC|5|Size :Large/X-Large fit my father-in law who is 180 lbs and 5'11&#34; very well-- it is ample and comfortable. My mother-in-law got the Medium size-- she is 5'4&#34; and 125 lbs. She had to fold the sleeves into a one inch cuff and she is very happy with the way it wraps around and fastens with the belt. They washed them before wearing and quite a bit of lint came off them but they are soft and have great lift. Just be sure to clean the dryer filter after drying them.
B005FZ39K8|4|these were for my teen daughter to wear under one of her shorter dresses.  They fit well and also provide a little figure control, so that is a plus.
B00MJ52LLA|5|Bought it for my sister. Perfect fit and she's so happy with the color
B005EXH7QS|3|Had these for about a year and a half. Was a little concerned based off of reviews that it may not be the same quality material you'd get at a store.<br /><br />They fabric wore through and I had to throw them out yesterday. To be fair, they're pretty thin and perhaps a year and a half is acceptable shelf life for this product - 35-40 wears, ten or so trips to the dry cleaner.<br /><br />For reference, around the same time I also bought this style in a few other colors and thus far those are holding up OK - the stitching at the bottom of a couple of them has come undone so I need to be careful putting them on, but that could be me just being too rough with them.<br /><br />This time I've opted to order a different brand off Amazon to see if they're any more durable.
B005N7YXZS|5|I love my Bellaband!  I initially purchased the Bellaband because I wanted some support for my growing baby belly (I don't need the support for exercising purposes, just for general everyday comfort).  I'm in my 6th month, and this belly is starting to get heavy and awkward, especially when I bend over.  When I received the Bellaband I was a little nervous by the packaging, which explains how to use the Bellaband to hold up non-maternity pants and whatnot, and says nothing about support.  The &#34;wearing non-maternity pants&#34; ship sailed a few months ago for me, so I was concerned maybe this wasn't the product for me.  But I tried it out anyway and it's great.  I wear it with the rubber strip along the bottom, over my underwear waistband, then I pull the Bellaband up over my belly and fold in half, so the top meets the bottom again.  And then my (full-panel maternity) pants go over the Bellaband.  The Bellaband offers just enough support to keep my belly from feeling like it's just hanging, plus it prevents my underwear from rolling down under my belly, and it helps keep under-the-belly maternity pants up.  The material is breathable too - after wearing the Bellaband for a few 80 degree days already, I think it'll be comfortable in the summer.
B002KRYP3O|2|So, ok, I realize this is written in the context of having only paid $10 for this item. However, I would have GLADLY paid $20 for this had it been of better quality! The headpiece had a hole in it and several loose strings from sloppy sewing. So, I had to sew a couple things just to get it presentable. Then, just as I'm about to put the headpiece on my son on Halloween, I notice that one of the ears are sewn on upside down! Or, more specifically, they sewed two of the same ears on the headpiece- one right side up, the other upside down- like they ran out of left ears and figured \\"Awww- they'll never notice.\\" Problem was it was VERY noticeable!<br /><br />Took son around for a brief trick-or-treating session (mostly just to say hi to neighbors- he's too young for candy) and most people thought he was dressed as a lamb because of the droopy ear! Ok, I'm assuming these weren't big Star Wars fans but STILL! Such a disappointment.<br /><br />Two recommendations if you're going to get this costume:<br />1) If you're not certain about size, get the bigger size- especially if your kid has a larger head<br />2) Get your hands on a dark green or brown eyeliner pencil and draw in some wrinkles on kid's forehead- really brings the costume together a bit more.
B00CIZNZ3Y|5|Love it!!
B005GYGGX0|4|These are comfortable and just what I needed for my class!
B00EK912U4|5|For what is really just a $10 costume accessory, this is a really nice hat. It fit a bit large on my head, but I might be about a quarter inch smaller in diameter after a hair cut since I cut down to a &#34;zero&#34; with the electric clippers (military high-regulation fade). With a full head of hair, I reckon this hat would sit very nicely. For 10 bucks, this hat is a bargain.
B007ASMJCW|5|These fit great!
B00I0EDTVK|1|I am a size 14. These would fit a children's 14.
B005HXQ2HA|5|This airy scarf is just what I was looking for since I have a thin, long neck and sometimes scarves look too bulky on me.  I also have sensitive skin and even though this is made of synthetics, it did not cause me to itch at all.  I also received many compliments.  At first I thought it might be too &#34;young-looking&#34; for me (65 yrs. old), but it gave me just the right amount of a sassy,  youthful look.
B00FWL71RW|5|very nice material isn't too short isn't too long...love it
B00K6QZY68|5|great fit, great for travel. Also wash well.
B003G5CKJK|5|My granddaughter wanted to be a grease girl this year and everything was perfect.
B00EMG3WG2|4|Nice little outfits for 6 to 7 pound twins.  Soft and comfy, washed well.
B00FZHCEHK|5|Best pants in the universe! I'm always looking for comfy pants that look good and in the past I find one and then never can find it again. So this time  when I first bought this one and tried it I went back and bought as many as I could afford. I was apprehensive at first because they are polyester. Polyester pants often time look old like from the '70's. These don't look polyester. They look like regular khaki's, but they are so comfortable, durable, and they can look dressy or casual. They are the best pants ever. I look good for work but I feel like I'm wearing pajamas. I also bought the haggar moisture wicking polos. They are super soft and dressy too. I also want to mention I bought the grey pants with the black polos. I also wear the sketchers equalizer shoes and I feel like I'm walking on air. Don't hesitate with these pants. Get them while you can.
B0030EV5HK|5|Its a good hat
B00GWQTLEM|1|Runs way too big
B008OQTR24|5|I love it😍
B00R0OCP8E|4|nice shape and quality. I ordered an extra large. I normally wear large ... xlarge was snug and i'm thinking it will shrink after the first wash. Order 1 size bigger.
B008E4W8BS|3|These trunks are made of nice material, fit well (if you like them fitted), but I thought they were ugly. To be fair, I will tell you a little about what I was looking for and why I thought these were goofy looking, because others may disagree.<br /><br />I am 24, 5'10, 150lb, waist size 30. For those wondering about size, these were good (again, if you don't want baggy trunks). My wife and I were going on a cruise so I bought these because somehow I lost my other swim trunks (don't ask me how that happens). I was looking for a relatively inexpensive replacement. Because we were going to be on a boat, I knew it would be ok to walk around like I was at the pool. But I thought these were way to 'trunk' looking. I guess my preference is board short? These just screamed swimwear.<br /><br />I may be too snobbish, but I have not found a pair of swim trunks that I like that are not from J Crew, Abercrombie, or something similar. These just reminded me of what my nephew (who is 9) wears. I guess when I am looking for something like this, I want it to be a little more mature (this may not be the right word) looking.<br /><br />Good quality, but I thought I looked goofy in them.
B006QLBAU6|5|The picture doesn't show that they are knitted very well, but they are nice and warm! They fit my large, female hands very well. Nice and toasty at -8*.
B00E3V9T4A|3|Its took a while to recieve it. However i like how it fits to me. The crystal thing is a lil heavy but its fine to me cause it has strap. i like the bottom too fits my booty good.
B00B1VKNPO|4|Nice hat . Good service from seller.
B00428BYZ6|4|I'm 5' 7&#34; and this dress is still long on me but I love it!
B00SKSZMKM|1|Fast Shipping due to my prime account but the SIZE of this bathing suit is TINY TINY TINY!!! I ordered a XL and I am 5&#34;7 and 150 with curves I couldn't even get this pass my damn thigh!!!
B00NJOAJ5U|5|I love this outfit but it did run a little big and took several weeks to arrive.  My granddaughter looked so cute in this and it was an amazing price for the quality and number of pieces that come with the outfit.
B00B2FU3TU|4|These shorts are great! Took one star off because one of the buttons broke off the second time I wore them. It wasn't really a big deal, though. Google \\"YMI size chart\\" for these because they run about 1 and a half sizes bigger than the size chart amazon provides.
B00KOKYUT8|3|nice hat. fits a little large though
B00KFPTZGK|2|Too small. Not true to size.
B008G29CVW|1|These socks would be fantastic, if only they would stay on. I tried them with several types of shoes and after a few hours they slipped off into my shoe every time.
B00ACIHFTE|5|Good boxers, thanks.
B00J9TBCHI|4|Good product and is as advertised
B003ZJMQY6|4|they fit pretty good thank you
B00JEFY0Y4|5|All my friends want this shirt!
B00EIQS9GO|5|I like the shirt. It's pretty much self explanatory in the meaning.
B00HRFTF7U|5|good product,and no problems with order.
B00D8VKWTC|5|I'm happy with the purchase
B00C1SHPTI|5|Great gift
B00KE8HG1E|5|I wasn't sure if I should have ordered the 2xl or the 3xl. I'm 6'02&#34; 267lbs and my waist is a 42. I went with the 2xl and it fits perfectly. There is enough room in it to be comfortable and also not too bulky to wear it under your winter clothes. The length of the arms and legs are dead on. I will definitely order more in the future.
B001J6OMR6|5|I wear a D and with a bra size that big you, most of the time, get stuck with being uncomfortable. I stumbled across this bra one day && decided to try it. I LOVE it. Its so comfortable && my boyfriend thinks its very sexy. I can wear it at just about an occasion && not be rubbed wrong or wanting to rip it off. I like the custom lift part alot, it really rounds everything out beautifully. I am just all around pleased with these bras. I plan to buy one in every color :)
B00D2WSSOI|5|Thumbs up!
B000SKI752|4|Tops are thinner and less snug than other Hanes socks, but, since I am prone to edema, that works out for me.  Hated them at first, but am now a convert.  Will buy again.
B001RLUTOI|3|The aluminum wallet does allow organization of my credit cards and other needed cards.  It appears to be sturdy enough although I am not sure the clasp will hold up after extended use.  I do wish it had been a little bit smaller in width as it is hard to sit on it with it in your back pocket.  I have to carry it in my front pockets especially on long trips.
B00RH4TPCQ|5|It was beautiful.<br />Everyone loved the dress, especially my husband<br />thank you and keep making people happy with your quality products.
B009GERQUS|5|I was pleasantly surprised to see how well this bra fit. It is to lightweight and smooth and comfortable! It's cute on top of it!! I am VERY happy with this purchase. The back has a smooth finish when its clasped and it doesn't pull, poke or tug anywhere. For ordering it online I wasn't sure how well it would fit! But I would definitely recommend it to anyone, and will probably purchase another one for myself!
B00S3UQ9TK|5|Excellent material and great fit
B0092XAB64|5|Close to perfect.
B0057XIFX4|2|My last pair is an XL, so this time I naturally ordered the same.  Maybe where they are made or some snafu in packaging, but the body is short and the leg length seemed short too...I'm sending back for XXLT size this time
B00332FI4K|3|This coat has a rubber fabric that actually squeaks when you walk (swinging arms).  Maybe that is why it is called Rubber Ducky.  It is quite warm, but I was looking for a coat with a hood, which, for some reason, is hard to find.  It works (keeps you dry), so that is all that counts. The snaps make it easy to close and open.
B00AKSCXES|4|Shorts were as described, though they developed a rip in the crotch after a year of wear. Probably more my fault than the manufacturer's.
B0085YBCNM|4|Based on reviews, I ordered these for my husband a size bigger. They fit good. My complaint is the color. I bought this to match a sweatshirt he already had. Doesn't match. Annoying
B005JQ466Y|1|i am six foot one.  the waist band of the pants comes up to my chin.  I have no idea who these pants would be for.
B003552QHC|4|This camisole feels wonderful - luxurious and silky, and I like that it has no spandex so it doesn't ride up or cling.The only issue is that it shows under many tops because of the way it is cut.
B0058D1P62|3|I am a size 36 full C, and all I want in this world is a bra that doesn't pinch, bite, sag, or show through.  These are like compression bandages.
B00MFKXABO|4|I ordered this for my granddaughter who is almost 4.  I bought the size advised for a 4-5 year old.  It's inexpensive yet a really pretty dress, the material is soft so a child doesn't need to be uncomfortable while dressed up.  The dress is sized pretty big.  Our little one would need to wait a few years to wear it but I have plenty of time to get her another dress.  We always do Angel Tree gifts so I think I will bring this along when we make our delivery and an older little girl can have a pretty new dress.  I think it would work well for any season other than summer.  Fine as a winter holiday dress, Valentine's or Easter.  The ribbon/sash is separate from the dress so the bow can be at the front, back or toward one side.
B00D2P4XB2|1|these were so big they fell off!
B004MMFWR8|4|*UPDATED at bottom*  Expectations for this hat were low going in.  If you've been to a Metallica show (or any show, for that matter) you know just a t-shirt can be $35-40.  So an officially licensed Metallica reversible beanie that actually looks nice at $8 is suspect from the get go.  I bought it anyway because I wanted to test out how Amazon Lockers worked here in NYC.  On the bright side, the locker experience was great and I will be taking advantage of that.  The hat on the other hand...  It had a nice weight to it and seemed less bulky than the picture.  The grey Metallica logo is crisp and awesome looking as always.  But when I flipped it inside out to check out the Death Magnetic logo, I found that the stitching on the inside was thick and poorly done.  It's so thick the hat won't invert all the way.  Furthermore, there are about 6-8 loose stitches per inch and the whole hat was literally falling apart at the seams.  It appears to my eyes (I'm no seamstress) that a standard black Metallica logo beanie was taken, and the Death Magnetic reversible part was stitched on it.  I can see through the nearly 2\\" split seam that the black part of that hat is its ownpiece and this isn't a single piece hat dyed and embroidered differently on each side.  I'm returning this immediately.  It shipped in a box not a bag so the chances of the stitches getting damaged in transit are nearly nil.  I have a strong suspicion that the hole was caused by the lousy stitching.  So the replacement will likely also be terrible.  If the replacement is better and this one hat is a fluke I'll definitely update this review.  If you don't see an update then this one-star review stands.  Misc. stuff:  -Made in China (fair assumption anyway, right?)  -100% cotton  -Wraps side of head like skin, but has bulky bulges around scalp  -Not cushiony  -Warmer than I expected.  Probably good down into the mid-20's Fahrenheit  P.S.  This is Metallica related item, so some crank is going to point out that\\"all their best most meaningful material was in the 80s now they suck blah blah blah\\".  True, those are my fav albums as well, but give Death Magnetic a fair shot, it really rocks and has some winners.  I saw them on the tour for this album and they truly are a great live band, even if the kinetic frenetic rage from 30 years ago has mellowed with age (there's a song lyric in there).  Now I've taken care of all the off topic crud, please feel free to make comments relevant to the hat and review only.  SLAAAAYYYEEEERRRR!  UPDATE:  The second one is a lot better.  No rips, tears or holes.  Again, the hat looks its best with the black side out; the stitches are clean, even and relatively small.  The grey Death Magnetic logo side out is better this time.  Following the seams I can see where the stitches get thin and weak.  I treat my stuff carefully though.  Since this hat came properly and it is official merch at such a low price, I'm gonna crank this up to 4 stars, though it really should be 3.5.  If you get a well-made one, this hat will be great.  Otherwise, Amazon's great policies will take care of you.  Final note, the product description page says the hat is 100% acrylic, but the tag on the hat says 100% cotton.  It's acrylic.
B00NIX0PDS|5|Nice quality. Fits perfectly! :)
B0007YR9Z8|5|So comfortable I can ware it all day with no digging from the strap
B00FF58YK8|1|This mess of stitched together bunny skins and raccoon skins is disgusting.  Not only is it cheap and tacky looking (something you'd see on a street corner), but animals suffered and died to create it.  Don't wear fur!
B00135ZZKQ|5|Nice Shirt to workout
B00MXV806K|2|The shirt fits as expected and is actually pretty cute.  The reason for my low rating is that it REEKED a of cigarettes (as a former heavy smoker I can pin that smell a mile away).  I had other items shipped in the same box, including infant clothes, and nothing else smelled like cigarettes.  There were also no tags on the shirt, leaving me to believe that this was a used item.  For as much as I paid for the shirt, I expected a new item of clothing.  I intend to contact the seller about this issue.
B00K6OYJES|5|Awesome fast service love it thank you
B00EZT1MXG|5|Great quality and fit perfectly.
B00E7O6P3G|5|Love these! Bought these 2 pair when the new colors came out this month! Fit is the same. The ONLY minus: no pockets, but even with this, worth it as they are comfy AND have belt loops...
B00DQ3Y5EU|5|This is a cute bra. I find it difficult as a smaller-chested female to find bras that look cute and provide adequate support while not making me look overly padded under my shirts. This bra fits the bill. Just remove the inserts if you don't like extra padding (I personally do not).
B00FFHGI9K|4|got this gift. great
B00O3IWYSQ|1|This mouse pad does not look 'sparkly' as the image shows. It actually looks like a black and white photo copy of the image here. Totally unimpressed for the price I paid for this mouse pad. Could have gotten much better for much less.
B00CZ7VORY|5|GREAT BRA! LOVE IT!!
B003QOQ0WO|3|Again it was a present .It was supposed to be red but recipient liked it and had a shirt that went well with it .Ordered in size small fit well .he liked it .It is more of a purplish color,a unique color and it goes well with a few of his shirts so he was very happy with it.
B0006U69PO|4|have worn the wrangler 936 jeans for years. comfortable slim fit jean.<br />Thanks
B00DJNWGCU|1|fits well, got a hole in toe after wearing 1 time, cheap
B009197PG8|5|PURCHASED THIS SUPER HAT FOR MY MAN, HE IS A VETERAN AND REALLY LOVES IT. MADE WELL, FAST DELIVERY.<br />SAYS IT VERY COMFORATABLE TO WEAR. I WAS FAR AWAY AND SURPRIZED HIM, TOLD HIM TO OPEN MY BOX, HE WAS SO HAPPY TO GET THE HAT FOR HIM., ITS SPECIAL. DEANNA C.
B007O3RZVI|4|Nice costume for the price. Better than expected
B00YBYIA94|5|perfect
B001IV1P6I|5|Super soft, comfortable, ample sizing so it will last longer!  I've bought many b/c we love them so much!
B00QQU3T4W|5|Love them!
B00HO6N3JI|1|I'm a size 12.  XL always fits me just right.  This thing wouldn't fit a 6yr old.  It's waaaaayyyy too narrow around the ribcage.  Quality is a joke.  The straps are very wide and cheap.  Think seatbelt material.  The hemming is garbage.<br />DO NOT waste your money.
B000TZ07MC|2|I but slippers inside and it fit on my size 13 feet. by the end of the night I had worn through them so only got one use out of them.
B003EIUSFW|3|I bought this shirt for my dad and it fit him great! But when he put it on it had holes on the side. Don't know if I wanna keep buying shirts if they're going to come with holes in them.
B00K8N4TII|5|Great shirt
B0002MGB8Q|5|Fit perfect and so easy to launder
B00BJGMY12|5|I wasn't sure about purchasing my wedding dress online but I am very happy I did! I emailed me the my sizes and told them I was only 5 foot and when the dress came in (when they said it would) it fit me perfect. I am very happy with this dress, it is more beautiful then the picture gives it credit.
B00D3D4ASE|3|good but is too large according to the size
B00SRKEP7Y|5|It is very comfortable and well fit on my body. I strongly recommend this product. Its very nice.
B00H2C27RI|5|Awesome gift for my fianc&eacute;. He loves the look and color. Nice quality as well. He is about 160 bs, I ordered the medium plus and it fits him well.
B003OBJJJ0|3|Not off the shoulder enough but still cute... I love the style of it and the material just think that the the side where the drop shoulder is couldccone down more
B00A3EZB7K|5|Beautiful color and style  with great lift and fit!  Love all the colors they come it, white, black, purple, red, blue. This is my 6th one I've bought!
B0031U0NYY|5|Great belt, made well, nice leather, fits great!
B00WT7VV1E|5|These boxers are going be a small/gag gift and they are just as described and appears in the picture. The bag is even bigger than I thought. Very pleased with my purchase.
B00A7Y4SG6|5|Thought I bought my brother this shirt was too big, but turned out perfect...fit..so not returning...he loves the shirt and colors !
B00OMA7NU4|5|Really warm and is a good value , id recommend this set of pajamas to anybody who needs warmer pajamas for a toddler. My son looks pretty cute in them too
B00GBE09DC|4|Bought the sweatshirt for my father in law.  Seemed pretty comfortable and fits like expected.  He says he wears it a lot.
B00B2B1UV4|5|I bought 2 of these Next Level Apparel Ladies Triblend Scoop Cotton T-shirts. I love the softness of the fabric and the flattering fit. These do run a bit small as I am normally a large or size 12. I am 5'7&#34; and 168 pounds. I bought XL in the vintage purple and vintage navy. The Navy one fit fine, but the purple was too tight. The company was easy to work with for an exchange and I got the XXL in vintage purple and it fits great. When I first contacted Amazon about the exchange, I was told via email that Next Level Apparel would have to contact me directly and it might take a few days. As it was close to the end of the return period, I was worried about that, but I heard from Next Level immediately and the return was super easy. I will be ordering from them again.
B00JM8MWTI|5|Great fit
B00170ZYIU|5|This hat does keep the sun's rays off your face, unlike a straw hat would.  It is crushable and very convenient.  It is lightweight, but the brim still holds its shape, even after bouncing back from being manipulated a million times.    You can definitely get away with one of these in black with a nice summer dress for dinner out.  But the cotton/linen texture of the fabric isn't something for eveningwear.  I've gotten so many compliments on this hat.  Got some for my mother too and she always gets complimented.  A great buy!
B00FWK9FM2|5|Nice
B0012KY7KG|4|This necklace is a great rendition of Fai's staff, and is very well made. The charm is a little over two inches tall, and is flat on the back. My only issue with it is the unusual thickness of the chain. Its fine for wearing with jackets, over t-shirts, and cosplay, but the chain is a little thick to be worn as a really nice necklace. The links aren't obscenely thick, but they are large enough to look a little cartoonish if worn with a dressy top, and the chain is something that I would expect to see on a guy's necklace more than anything. Aside from my concern about the chain, its a great necklace, and I'll certainly be wearing it in the future!
B00B9HD9HY|5|great size and quality for the price.  Very nice looking.  Shipping was extremely fast.  I would recommend if you are looking for an inexpensive professional looking belt.
B00D4IYUBA|5|Runs small. Always wear a 27, but had to exchange for a 28. Love the pants!! Appliqué much cooler in person.
B007THA9VW|5|I bought these outfits for my twins, Male/female.  They were so adorable.  Outfit fitted perfect, love it.  I encourage these out fits to anyone that want to buy them
B00CHMKA8G|5|THE UPSIDE DOWN CROSS ON THE CATS FOREHEADS ARE NOT SATANIC IN ANYWAY.<br />An upside down cross is the CROSS OF SAINT PETER, a theistic symbol. Theistic means you believe in a higher power (i.e, christianity- which is monotheistic)
B00BWJ2ZHY|3|I hoped these were more comfortable which is kind of funny right for girdle type wear?  By the end of my work day I wanted to burn them.
B005CW07UO|1|These are NOT made the same as they used to be. Made on a much lower standard. The front panel used to be doubled and very supportive. Not anymore. Also, they use a thinner material all around and this makes these briefs ride up in the back. You can't find these at the stores anymore so you order them and assume they are the same, but they are not. By the way, I have been wearing this type and brand for twenty plus years so I know what changes they have made. I will now have to go through the process of finding a different type.
B009B2V8SQ|5|This scarf is warm and good quality for a very reasonable price.  The faux fur is quite luxurious as stated.
B00606NGZ4|5|Love this jacket is very comfortable to wear plus good water repellant as well.Great for hiking or just about town. Material and construction of jacket is good.
B006TQKFYK|4|I love this wallet so much! It's wonderful, it's fuzzy, it has a lot of room and it's cute as heck! The only downside is the button to keep the wallet closed ripped the material not long after I got it.
B0058ZW9N8|4|I thought under hoodie would haven been purple only the polo logo is but its ok otherwise 👍🏾
B00WHQUWGM|5|Love it.  Nice and roomy.
B00NLNLP70|3|Decent quality but size charts are way off. The XL is at best a medium. Go two sizes up from what you normally wear.
B008XD3AKS|5|really warm coat, my daughter is a really small young lady, well fits her perfectly, and she love it.  was a bargain . thanks
B00GZKP4GO|2|I just received the hat today and I agree with the one star review previously written.  The hat has a much wider knit, does not have the seaming that sections the hat into quarters, and the horns are placed on top of the head and look like weird white pincers more than horns. The hat also has a weird smell emitting from it.  This product came shipped from China.
B00IZ38GL4|5|Really cute and actually fit an American woman true to size..
B007AFUU30|5|Shipping was fast and the item was packaged very professionally. To celebrate Dr. Seuss birthday my school placed a mandatory dress up day for all teachers. I spent countless hours on Amazon.com looking for an inexpensive Cat In the Hat costume (I was against paying a lot of money for a costume I was only going to wear one time) finally, I came across this costume and it fits great. I'm a size 10 in women clothing and the XL Shirt hangs perfectly without being too tight. The shirt even came packaged with the blue wig as advertised on the web page. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase and I will buy from this company again.<br /><br />** To answer the many questions as of March 2, 2015 ....YES the blue wig comes with the shirt! **  :)
B00VKJ8QVK|5|I ordered these as a gift for my partner and she simply loved them. They are very comfortable and go with so many bright summer colors. I will be ordering again.
B010S788TE|5|I wear a U.S. size 16-18 and ordered a 6x as directed on sizing. Fits perfectly and it is beautiful. Only took a week to receive not a month.
B00GY170ZM|5|Got soooooo many compliments. I was Mary Jane for halloween
B00C5140AI|5|Great style, casual look, washable and easy care. My husband wears Dockers daily and is always dressed appropriately. I would say he has worn them for the last ten years. Is not comfortable in jeans.
B00HYU0W70|5|It is so hard to find pretty, frilly, girl clothes in orange - my daughter's favorite color.  The top part is tee shirt - so it is comfy, not scratchy, and the frills are sewn on.  This was a great find.
B004TB2B4E|5|very cute shirt, came quickly and in perfect condition as what is pictured. He likes it very much and will be wearing it on our wedding day.
B00SNOLJKK|5|fair price - Quick delivery - nice T-shirt
B00K72JJN0|3|To small
B00P9OSTTG|5|Love my pants, absolutely better than expected
B006R28WQE|3|Couldn't wear it for the event I bought it for, but it is so pretty that now I am determined to  lose those extra pounds!
B001PULAJ4|5|This tie was just what my son wanted. Even though it was shipped from China it came fairly quickly.  It's nice quality and works well whether you want it for a formal outfit or as a Dr. Who fan.
B00BW9IQFY|5|Good deal. Great shirt! Who does;t like Chewie! Then put him cool shades with his hair blowing in the wind...with a purple back drop. .Makes the shirt stand out!
B00KLXDYNQ|5|Love it. Can't wait to wear with spring coming soon!
B00FZR1ZYI|5|Comfy and stay put. No shrinkage. I bought several pair.
B00JZ7F4FU|5|Bought this for my son who as great physique.  This shirt looks great, is soft, washes well, and the girls seem to like the look too. Lol
B00H5IOEOI|4|Nice dress. Fit a little tighter than expected. Overall happy with it.
B00J4W841M|5|This product is just as it appears, comfortable, cute, and fits fine. I recommend this skirt to anyone who wears a skirt, Girls, guys, whom ever.
B004WHXT4G|4|This Anne Klein Walker is a very nice lightweight coat. The foto is true to the color of the coat. The fit (I am a 12.) is a comfortable one-enough to accommodate a sweater. The collar has two stitches which cause the collar to fold as you see in the foto. Very stylish.I was not disappointed in the purchase; however, I was disappointed in the packaging of the coat. It was sent in a too small box and was a wrinkled mess when it arrived though it had been neatly folded. Nevertheless, I was happy with the purchase and would reccommend it to anyone seeking to purchase a transitional weather wool coat.
B00O5EW47E|5|Ties for all occasions. No reason to give it lower than five as the quality is great.
B00GOKJGWS|5|i like this alot
B002R0EYMQ|5|very warm and durable. a lot better then others cheaper pairs I've had.  worth the money
B005A22HD6|5|This shirt made me look just like Billy Mays for a commercial.  Hi, Billy Mays here for the chambray shirt!  It's tough, blue and made just for you!  It is the blue long  sleeve that will make you elite!  Act now and get a big black beard absolutely FREE - just pay separate processing and handling LOL!.  Great for work, general use or a BILLY MAYS style look! Don't delay.. order NOW!
B00KT015U0|4|VERY NICE DRESS. THE MATERIAL IS A BIT THIN, BUT NICE FIT
B002X78SHA|2|I always bought Hanes briefs because they are comfortable, have a good classic shape and last long. But this time even though they are perfectly shaped I discovered lot of issues with quality. Seams are not aligned, can be easily torn. Material used in waist band emanates unpleasant rubber smell not found on other brands and on Hanes before. The whole thing is simply poorly made. One pair already has one of seam separated and most likely will be thrown away soon. Looks like Levis Hanes went to cheap overseas sweatshop and do not care about quality anymore - only about discount price. Well, you get what you paid for. I would recommend to avoid this product and find something of higher quality. Or go to you local retailer so you can inspect quality before you buy.
B00E006EME|5|Fit great. This is a awesome shirt.
B00OZ80J6S|3|Excelente.!
B00K2F5VAW|3|The inside finish is lacking...
B004UM7YUS|2|Got the product it was all smashed up and folded couldnt get the creases out not happy at all
B00GXEFF84|5|I usually use small to medium men's size jackets.  This small fits well, it is rugged and comfortable.  It looks great and keeps the rain off!
B005QJT70E|5|People loved this. It is hilariously over the top. The star wasn't centered on mine, and the brim has a couple of kinks even when fully inflated but we are not going for historical accuracy here. It was actually pretty comfortable for me.
B00DMFF5YG|5|If your looking for an awesome mask for cheap. BUY THIS ONE! Looks great in the picture but even better in person.  :-) I got so many compliments at tge Halloween party I just went to.
B00GTRN83Y|5|Fit and finish good.
B00D82GG00|5|Not much to say, except BUY THESE. Comfy, lightweight, best casual pants I own!
B008JIX6VA|4|Was perfect for my wedding dress, but I did not like how the rhinestones fell off ... Over all good prouduct and fast shipping!
B005SZFJUS|3|good for school
B00KZIOMJ2|5|I really love this jacket- it is medium weight and fits my somewhat broad shoulders perfectly. Lining is nice, everything seems to be stitched together very well. It is a very dark Navy, but has very nice lines and will do the job perfectly.
B0089DX5GG|5|I have a big head and this fit extremely well.  Most hats don't fit down around my head well, so I need a neck strap to keep them from flying off.  This one fit down over my forehead, so I didn't need a neck strap.  Super cute!  My only complaint is that it came unsewn in one spot, but that was my fault for folding it in half and sitting on it while riding a roller coaster.  I was able to sew that spot and it's good as new.
B005J3L1EW|5|Great Product; great fit; great price, item came as expected; will recommend to a friend. My family memeber loved it!
B0013HCE8U|4|I bought this shirt for my staff party. I must say that it fits well and is very comfortable and stylish. I definitely had it going on at the party.
B00GSLSHHS|4|it's a beautiful shirt, don't get me wrong, and I am absolutely 100% in love with the image itself, but it's a tad too big. I ordered a small and it felt like I was wearing a medium.
B00I0IZN1K|5|I'd recommend this to anyone who's interested in different and unusual waistcoat styles. I had to pick one size up than I'd normally get (for reference, I have a 32&#34; waist and 38&#34; chest, and the Large is great on me), but there's an adjustable band at the back to take things in at the waist.<br /><br />Really pleased. The colour's exactly like it is in the image, too.
B00I36KMXI|5|Amazingly warm and comfortable. Takes some time to break in so it's not so tight, but it's great once it's fitted.
B00P8KKNXQ|4|It's very good. i like it except the size it's too small again so for sure order a size or 2 bigger.
B009CMPCQO|5|I bought this jacket for my son, he loves this jacket, members only jackets are stylish, while producing a versatile look.
B00CAAS5LE|3|It was to long.
B00OG1UQRG|5|:-)
B00N3R6I7Q|3|Sizing and quality questionable, but is really cute.
B00K14AJ56|5|I ordered the 24 months for my son who is 2 years and 1/2 and it fits perfectly. He is neither skinny nor fat so it justs fits perfectly. The quality is fantastic. Highly Recommended.
B009JYF92W|4|these shirt are very soft and light weight which is exactly what I wanted. they wash well
B00UZR0JT0|5|I love skiing and I love that there's a shirt that I can wear that shows it. I'm a pretty skinny 6' tall guy and this shirt fit me perfectly. I'll be on the lookout for more shirts from these guys!
B003S9X1O2|5|This shirt is more than adequate for the price.  Its sizing across the shoulders is a bit small, but the small fits me well enough.  I am happy to find that it washes well and does not need ironing if you remove it from the dryer fairly quickly.  The fabric is a bit heavy for summer wear.
B00EAA8QQQ|3|I always wash my son's clothes before I have him wear them.  He is currently in 24 months/ 2T and this shirt shrank quite a bit.  Even when I washed in cold and dried on delicate.  Disappointed that he will only be able to wear it one or two times to let people know that I am expecting.
B00NVRAUQI|5|What else can you say?!?  Actually a great sweater, very high quality, and fit even better than I expected.  Hilarious laser cats blasting gifts!  Sure, you can only get 2 or 3 wears out of it per holiday season, but it definitely draws some comments.
B00M9YF1G8|5|Fit as expected using size chart.  Nice quality and comfort.  Would buy again.
B0047N126C|4|Positives: Very comfortable & stretchy - feels like it would be moisture wicking too - great for a cool summers night  Negatives: I bought a medium but it feels that medium is really a large - possibly worth ordering one size smaller
B00RYGK93Q|5|The hat and the scarf are very warm especially for low temperatures This is a great product.
B00E64MSH4|5|My husband loves this robe.  Its thin and comfortable.  Not bulky. Fits as expected.  Great warm weather robe to wear
B000W4953W|3|This is an attractive and very supportive bra, but I only gave three stars because after I wore it to a wedding I had a sore spot underneath the cups in the center. I mean it was rubbed raw and nearly bleeding. Right in between my breasts and above my stomach. For a somewhat pricey bra, I found this disapponting.
B00JRZ5AAO|5|I have had many compliments on this scarf.  I love the color and print combination.
B007HOT7A6|2|I ordered a XXL and thought maybe I had received the men's version--because this one was so long and the arm holes were ginormous. Definitely not cut for a woman. Returning pronto!
B0093799MG|4|for dressing up a rain boot.
B00OCYQ90A|4|These hats are not completely lined inside and therefore not as warm as they look-- warm but not as warm as they appear to be in photos. Also, they are cheaply made and the white fuzzy lining comes out easily. Outside of that, they look ADORABLE on, are great for photos, hold up in the wash (do not put in dryer), and fit the heads of my 6 month old, as well as my 2 year old.
B00KRC47GE|4|Love this jacket.  Warm enough for cold fall days.  I wouldn't suggest for freezing cold winters.  Soft fabric and easy to clean.  Only thing I would change is that hood is removable and is attached by four buttons.  Will try to add additional buttons.  Over all I would say this is a nice jacket for the price.
B001BXPZPA|5|LOVED this costume! It was comfortable and wasn't itchy at all.
B00CTPXE6G|5|Came just like the picture shows
B003X59VDQ|5|i love this bow my son looked so handsome for thanksgiving with this on so many ppl askn wrer i get it from i love when my son stands out
B00JJQT7EQ|5|I decided to purchase this gown for my Mom because the previous hospital gowns that I purchased for her was making her look more sick. I chose the 0-10 sizxe for her.  My purchase was an experiment.  When my Mom wore this gown, she looked amazing.  The type of cloth that was used was soft and comfortable,  The price is also very reasonable.  I will buy two more.
B00362MN72|5|Fast shipping and good quality hats
B002L069AM|3|They dry fast since the waterproof part isn't sewn onto the actual liner part.     However, it's not much different than wearing a pair of gerber training pants with one of those plastic covers except that these are sewn together at the waist.     I wouldn't recommend them if you have a heavy wetter, once the pee soaks through the liner these are messy! They're better for a light wetter.
B000A4SZ1M|5|So I bought 2 pair of these and literally wore then everyday at work and at home for 2.5 years.  The outer layer of fabric finally gave out at the knee so I made them into shorts. Great value for the money.
B0012ZAUM0|5|I have 5 of these, wish I could get the other colors in my size, but even still I love it enough to order several of the white ones.  This is a super comfortable bra with good support and withstands the washing machine and line dry.  I've been wearing this model for about 2 years now...  it's a winner.  Hope they keep it around.<br />____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />A year or two later...  was relieved to see this 'model' is still readily available.  I will say that the expected life on these is a bit shorter than I care for, the 'underwire' is plastic and not metal like in the old days...  and apparently I can find ways to break them.  Once they snapy the bra is done for..  but still comfortable. I machine wash, line dry.  I'm guessing the average life is 30 months.<br /><br />__________________________________________________________________________________________<br />2017 update:  Just bought another, and took note that the cut of the cup has changed. Sadly these are not borderline 'pointy tits' shaped.  Not very happy.
B00Q7COPCO|5|Absolutely darling outfit. Made well. Good fit for my great niece (2yrs old)
B004RHNENW|5|I loved this costume because it was the most authentic Alice in Wonderland costume that I could find the others I found during my search were either too cheaply made or too slutty... This one was just right!
B00IJ6XRNY|5|I LUV THIS SHIRT!! IT CAME EARLIER THAN EXPECTED AND FITS EXACTLY LIKE THE MODEL. I WEAR IT WITH LEGGINGS AND BOOTS AND JUST LUV IT. IT IS SOOOOO COMFORTABLE. I ORDERED THE GREY ONE AND WANT TO ORDER THE WHITE ONE TOO BECAUSE I AM SO HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. THANKS!!
B008MA0Z46|2|Way too small and way too long.  I am 5'5&#34; and the pants are at least 5&#34; too long for me.  They shouId be for tall women, not medium height women. I usually wear a large and this large is too small.
B009LI97P6|5|This t-shirt is a gift for xmas.  I was worried the blue would be too bright but it is a great color.  It arrived sooooo quickly.  I trust this company even though they are so far away.
B00OJU9VMK|4|I removed the fake fur ball from the top as I thought it's much cuter without, and I bought fir my boy. Many compliments we have relieved on it with people asking if I made it
B00A3N3PAG|2|I guess you get what you pay for. Its all right from a distance, but it definitely looks cheaper once you get closer... In my opinion, not a chance this is &#34;white gold plated&#34; or &#34;swarovski crystals&#34;
B008A77ISW|1|I didn't expect Armani, but this bowtie is definitely the cheapest piece of you-know-what you can imagine. It comes with both sides folded in a way that requires you to open/expand it into bow-tie shape. But I found it virtually impossible to make it retain that shape. I suppose you could glue or staple it together, but of course that would be stupid.<br /><br />The other thing you should know: the packaging says &#34;remote control,&#34; but it is WIRED. There is a wire from the bow-tie (motor) that, presumably, you run under your shirt... and hope people don't notice, if you keep the battery-pack remote in your pocket. If you run the wire down your sleeve -- so that people can't see the wire -- you've got to somehow conceal the remote.<br /><br />So why didn't I return it? I was informed by the one-and-only distributor that I must (a) pay for return shipping and (b) pay a 20% restocking fee. Not worth my time, what I'll get back. Maybe I'll find some use for it. I wish there was a really good one out there; I'd spend more to get something of higher quality that actually looks and works as advertised. As you can tell, extremely disappointed.
B006LBR42O|5|I am 5'9&#34; and 148 pounds… These pants fit perfect... I love them! I have been wearing them for a while, I just needed some spring colors.
B00C7MISDK|4|Loved these pants for my daughter. Fit true to size, good quality and great look. Only down fall is they balled up after a few washes.
B006ZVFLS4|3|bought these for the comfort of seamless construction, but the downside is that the fabric is scratchy on the skin, and heats up with friction -- if your thighs touch, do not wear these walking or running without another layer
B00QGHNGC0|5|I love it so much! Got tons of compliments wearing this. I have curves, and this really shows off my curves more. I like the stretchy fabric as well!<br />Totally recommend this! You will love it! :)
B0044NGV84|5|My nephews look adorable in these shirts. The material was very nice quality, soft to the tough and washed very well. Shrunk up a small amount which was ok go the kids.
B009KY1TMA|5|I used to wear nylon briefs because of the nice way clothes go on over them but then I discovered these microfiber briefs and I'm a convert now.  They fit well, don't ride up and clothes glide over them.  I'm an older -- but fit-- woman and I really don't want the hi-cuts or the bikini styles anymore so these are just perfect.  I wear a size 10 in most things and these are a perfect fit.  I also had some in size 6 and, while they fit, these size 7's are more comfortable.
B003VYB6NM|5|It has come as expected  . worth 5 stars. Material is kind of special and soft and light. love it.
B00290KYIW|4|These were delightful prints to adorn my handkerchief angels. The material is lightweight and easily ironed after laundering. I wouldnt use them as a handkerchief, but as adornment, they bring a bright pop of color to a suit jacket or a craft.
B0040YP7GO|5|used for school patriots day good fit
B009PVDVTC|4|I like it
B00KNEE964|5|Great jeans. Definitely order your regular size. I usually order a size up in skinny jeans. But these fit loosely, so order your reg size. Great fit, awesome material! Very cute!
B00EOBPMR2|5|i just get my dress and i really like it. i'm 5ft3' and weigh 160lb it fits very nicely. falls little lower than what the picture shows and i'm very happy with that. normally i wear large(L) but be spandex i took mid., that gives me a perfect fit. the material is very nice jersey. do not cling to your body.  love , love it.
B00EBBMUV6|4|These footed pajamas are warm but not too heavy.  My grandson likes sports so these were ideal.  The size seems right and they were reasonably priced.
B00INMMQU4|5|Thank you.
B00VQV1N08|5|Fit is good and the cotton is soft. Some vintage style tees are too short but this one has just the right amount of length.
B00371TSRA|5|The legs are a little baggy for my taste, but they do breath a little. And in this unforgiving bakersfield sun that is appreciated
B00FEGF23K|3|Finding a while top that is not transparent is a tough one.  This sweatshirt like top is better than most but I would wear a teddy.  It is roomy as advertised.
B004CO9UVK|5|Great price, great fit and very comfortable!<br />For anyone that has had to wear one of these things all day long at work you know how important it is to be comfortable!<br />No underwire is my favorite part!
B005ZMKYTK|4|This is a very nice, stylish shirt which always attracts positive comments.  This particular item comes in a little larger than other Doublju shirts.
B00N5KNV4Y|5|It fits real good. and looks good.
B00ENGRTMO|5|Got this as a present for my dad and he loved it!
B0007YR9H6|5|These are my favorites!  They are everything I have come to expect from a Playtex product in both fit and quality.
B001KO3Q7E|5|This is a great formal wear satin tie at a great price.  Perfect for me.
B00PZA16J4|4|The fit is perfect!!!! Arrived on time!!!
B0023UQU0Y|4|They are nice shirts and fit well, the only thing is I think it could be maybe a half inch or so longer.
B00KGE0AT6|4|I like the coat.<br />It is a great coat with good styling--it fits good however sleeves a little long--but adjustable.<br />I would buy Jessica Simpson clothing again.
B00O7B4BVM|5|Love these! Look nice & keep my ankles warm!
B000PUCMNS|5|This mosquito netting is exactly what I needed. I work outside, and during the hot and humid weather, the bugs drive me crazy buzzing around my face and ears and neck. It can be worn over a hat or even by itself. It looks pretty wierd but who cares?! The only drawback is that it's a little harder to read my paperwork through the netting, but certainly not impossible. I'm entirely satisfied with this product.
B00A3S91RC|5|wowwww... really love my scarf and going to order another one . such a great quality and pretty. Great for summer!!!
B000936ND6|4|\\"Nick of Time\\" was the seventh episode of the second season of \\"The Twilight Zone,\\" first aired on November 18, 1960. A pair of newlyweds, Don and Pat Carter are traveling to New York City and have some car trouble that forces them to stop in the town of Ridgeview, Ohio. While their car is being repaired they decide to go get some lunch at a local diner. In their booth they find a cheap little novelty machine called \\"The Mystic Seer.\\" Give the Seer a penny, ask a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" question, and a small card is produced that provides an answer that predicts the future (the Seer has the face of the devil, hence the episode's title). With nothing better to do Don puts in a penny and asks if he will get the big promotion that he is waiting to hear about. The Seer replies \\"It has been decided in your favor,\\" and when Don finds out he did indeed get the job he decides to see what else the Seer can tell him.<br /><br />This memorable \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode usually stands out in the mind of fans because of the fine performance by William Shatner as Don (Patricia Breslin plays the wife), which is much better than what he did for the show in \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\" two seasons later. What gets forgotten is that this is yet another stellar script from Richard Matheson. The episode words because of the simple ambiguity of what the Seer \\"says\\" as Don puts more and more pennies into the machine. The Seer warns of danger and when Pat is almost hit by a car Don suddenly becomes a true believer and he not only has a whole bunch of pennies in his pocket, he knows how to get more.<br /><br />Of course, because this is \\"The Twilight Zone\\" there is always the possibility that it is not Don's superstitious beliefs but an actual supernatural power. Either way, Don is ready to let the cheap little machine make every decision, even if it seems like the Seer does not want the couple to leave town. The question then becomes whether Pat can convince her husband to stop feeding the Seer pennies and get out of Ridgeview. Matheson's script provides a nice little twist on how the story ends for Don and Pat, as well as another twist for the episode's coda. In case you are not clear on the point, Rod Serling's end narration emphasizes the \\"tyranny of fear and superstition.\\"<br /><br />This t-shirt features a blown up shot of the Mystic Seer's devil's head on the left with \\"The Twilight Zone\\" clock, one of the Mystic Seer's card asking \\"Do you dare risk finding out?\\", and the novelty machine itself.  I stumbled across a web site where a guy provides step-by-step instructions for making your own Mystic Seer novelty machine.  I am neither inclined nor adept at constructing such things, but if you are the sort of person who like this episode enough to have a t-shirt, then you might be one who would be interested in making one.  It would certainly be a great conversation piece (and if you do it right it actually works).ennies and get out of Ridgeview.

B002KPHXGM|5|My life has been lacking momentum for about 8 months now. In between the hum-drum 9-5 and the crippling loneliness I lost my way. It was like the world was drab. I'd wake up every day more bored than the day prior. You barely feel like a man -- dead behind the eyes and  praying for the sweet embrace of the grave.<br /><br />But one day I accepted the High-impact Sexual Energy that was Zubaz into the innermost workings of my life. I have begun to work out daily. Why? Because I realized that the world doesn't have to be a hard place. That deep down we all deserve to have our faith rewarded. These pants have shown me that even though we are blood and bone, we are much much more. We are here to experience life to the full. No limits, no judgement, no cardio, no isolation. Test your limits. Climb the mountain of your own insecurities, look down upon your accomplishments and spit on them. Your wildest dreams are yet to come.<br /><br />The human spirit is an enigma we all live. Now you can live that mystery girded about your legs and buttocks.<br /><br />Thank you, Zubaz. I will not let you down.
B001CJTA0E|4|Happy with the condition of the product and timely manner in which I received it
B00NTP0O22|5|This hat is nice and warm and the bill keeps out the low winter sun. I have a very small head and this hat is very snug. Wouldn't recommend for normal to large head unless you don't mind snug.
B00OD4D038|5|I am in my 50's, 5' 4&#34; tall and it's so hard to find something that looks really nice for my frame and body shape. But this really looks nice. I have gotten so may comments on it.
B00KY71N64|5|I love it!!..I am going to purchase one of a different color every month!!...I will enclose a pic later..I am 5'10, 165, Mediterranean skin color. I  choose the olive in large..and received complements on how it flows all day!!..very flattering and forgiving of the mid section.
B007S9L4Y2|5|very handy...
B00NYGO8BY|5|I'm a really hugh fan of Rogue and her outfit is so awsome and cute! It so comfortable to wear and is great for both cosplay and sleeping in. The colors on it look really great and i love green and yellow and the stitching on the X is very well done! The material is thin however so you better be careful when putting it on not to pull too hard otherwise you could tear it but the suit does stretch and as long as you order the right size you should be alright. I'm 5 ft 5 in and x-large fitted me fine. This is also something your not supposed wear clothing under with the exception of under garments, you also don't wear socks while in it but sure to wear shoes if go out in it. I love all of Rogue's outfits but since I came to know the X-men through the 90's animated series I grew up watching the Rogue from the show love everything about her including her outfit (ps the brown leather jacket is my favorite part). All and all this is clearly for anyone who's a fan of that cool, cute, funny, beautiful, high flying, super strong, and indestructible skunk haired Mississippi southern belle who we all know simply as Rogue.
B00DMEFU3S|5|We are a family of ample-bosomed women, and as such we needed to buy the larger size even though not needed otherwise.  The dress does fit very well, but just be cautious of that.
B00N23VW0Y|5|As expected, grandson loved it.
B008T5595O|3|The product is as expected. I bought it to wear with a costume. It went well, it's not hot pink though. Just pink.
B0058DR5NO|3|The costume was not sewed together too good. The belt and arm pieces were poorly sewn together. The mask wasn't even cut evenly. Overall the costume makes for a good design template to build my own costume like it to handle the wear and tear it will have to go through.
B005DD27C8|1|the product indicates 100% cashemer but when I received it the tag indicated just 50%, also there is something wrong about the shape, I returned the item
B009TB1HIA|1|This beanie isn't oversized at all. I don't like the way the beanie looks on. I will give this to someone who wants it
B004DYDQUK|4|I love this pendant very much, though I have three things that slightly bug me, though not enough to not love this piece. I got the chain to go along with my pendant; I am one of those people that like to have the flexibility of changing how low or high I want my pendant to hang. With the chain, there's only one end hoop. I do wish there were more definition to the engraving on the pendant, but I recognise that you can only get so much definition with certain materials and molds. Lastly, I wish the signature on the back wasn't as large. Bit of an eye-sore.    Regardless of these nit-picked complaints, I love this piece very very much. This is the equivalent of a gold cross to me.   Thanks so much.
B00PDJTW5M|5|buy a size smaller,now i know the correct size,great jeans good quality and very comfy will purchase again
B000MX93BC|5|Great product!  Good fit!
B00M3K2F6C|4|Cute top, Fits well. I'm 31&#34; 23&#34; 34&#34; as a reference and I ordered this in a small. Can snag easily though, so take care of the lace
B007ZBAYJE|5|i have been looking for a dress like this everywhere! It is lightweight and beautiful! I want the white and green one now!
B003HOFN7Q|5|Excellent!!
B00B1XCSUK|5|I love this top! I can show off as much or as little as I want! The detail in the material is fantastic, right down to the gold stitching!
B00LQYR250|4|The service was fast and amazing..but the shirt was way too large. Fit like a extra extra large instead of a large.
B00G9D8BFI|3|I didn't notice until after I'd washed it that the material tends to pill. Since then, I wash it separately and hang dry. I won't buy another one.
B006PHWL7C|5|I love it!
B00FBOS2A0|4|Good fit. Flattening to the figure.
B00E48ZVP8|3|super cute but it does run a bit small. I am 5'8&#34; and it would be more suitable for someone shorter
B0040AT2EQ|4|Nice material. True to size. My husband is 6'4&#34; & 250 lbs...fits the way he likes - with room to move!
B0002MQR6C|5|I like this item B0002MQR6C very much You should read more reviews to find out more about it
B00JZSJAM2|4|I purchased it to go under a gray sheer blouse.
B009YY2BGE|1|First I ordered an XL and it was gigantic.  Then I ordered a medium and it is really tight.  Can't win with this company, their sizes are all over the board. (I'm 5'6&#34;, small chest, 145lbs)
B007MU49PI|5|I own another pair of ultimate skinny leg and both are a great fit.  I like the look of the ultimate skinny as it is a tighter fit.  It is really flattering.  Calvin Klein did a great job on the tailoring of this style.
B00ICETH82|4|Bought this as a gift for my sister who wants to dress up her outfits.  She said she liked the colors and it has silky feel.
B00FNHRDVE|4|arms quite long fit great through but I expected it to be big for my grandson to wear next season got it a size larger
B0084B7BAY|4|Love this jacket.<br />Definitely buy a size down.  I always wear an XL, bought a L per the reviewers' advice.  Fits great.
B004U7SN8A|2|It was larger then expected, I upgraded the shipping but it still took four days to arrive.
B003IYYEB6|5|This is a truly amazing product. Most nursing tanks have shelf bras, which is useless for moms who need more support (which, let's face it, is most of us!) I hated wearing tanks with shelf bras in addition to a nursing bra underneath - bulky and uncomfortable. The Undercover Mama tank eliminates that hassle. It's comfy and stretchy, and doesn't bunch up under your shirts. It's long enough to cover your belly, and you don't have to worry about constantly tugging it down. Well worth the money!
B00M2UCL08|5|Love this jumpsuit. It's super cute and fits perfect
B00N0Z72R6|2|I followed the standard sizing chart and ordered what size it told me I would be... I got it today and I just printed the return label and its going back tomorrow. Its a beautiful corset and the color is vibrant but the sizing is nowhere near what was depicted, even with messing with the strings. I am so bummed out about this.
B0058OTWMK|5|I go to the gym daily. I'm not a real health nut, I'm just trying to be healthy.     I wanted something shorter than my normal workout pants, but I'm just not feeling shorts yet. These are perfect. They're soft and light-weight. I do plan on getting several pairs. Maybe in different colors!
B009GGOYVK|5|Great Christmas gift for my granddaughter!!!!!
B00279FQXI|5|This tie is neutral enough to go with many of my outfits, but the pattern is interesting enough to bring a new dimension to the outfit. I've been wearing it all of the time.
B00H34VLB8|5|Bought this for my little brother for Christmas. He was very happy with it! It's a little bit more stylish than what he usually wears (which would entail a hoodie with some metal band's logo on the front) but he immediately but it on and it looks great. Remember to size up since it's not American sizing.
B002SW3DNO|5|Adorable if you can get your kids to leave them on!
B00G0NEB4C|4|Only one sock each. I didn't notice:( Makes them twice as expensive.  Very nice socks though.
B003JOTJF6|4|Skirt fit well as expected.
B00NVEN626|5|I bought this for my niece's first birthday.  Everyone remarked on how cute it was.  More important is that Zoey is absolutely adorable wearing this.
B0044RXNKO|5|The scarf arrived quickly and was as described. I am very happy with the purchase. This is a gift for someone that has just purchased her mid-life crisis red convertible!
B005OFLSCA|5|Someone finally get's it. If you've worn tighty whities all you life or want to give them a try for the first time…... save yourself a lot of trouble and discomfort and buy these. They are absolutely,bar none, the best fitting briefs I have ever worn. They have a solid feel about them that makes you feel confident and comfortable right away. They look good and they hug your important parts perfectly.
B007OX447Q|5|Expected a light weight cotton robe and it is exactly what hubby wanted.  The length hit him mid calf and I ordered it for him in 2 colors.
B004XG2LDG|5|I got these for my granddaughter....I am told they are well made and she loves them!
B003F0G80I|5|After getting out the old tape measure and ordering the recommended size I was pleased to have a perfectly fitted hat after using a little stuffing in the rim. (part of the packing worked perfectly for this)  I wear this hat almost daily and get lots of comments about how it looks like an idiana jones hat then I show them the large inner label stating its an officaial indi hat.  The materials seem good it keeps iits shape and holds up to the elements great.  Provide a nice amount of shade for the eyes with the wide brim.  Thank you for a fantastic cheapo.
B00CBQ7I4C|2|My husband normally wears an 18&#34; to 20&#34; dress shirt (I normally get a 20&#34; to give him room in the collar). He not only couldn't button the collar, the shirt was too tight across the shoulders.  I did reorder the shirt in a 22&#34; because he really liked it and that shirt fit him perfectly. Great shirt but definitely runs very small.
B007KGAPB6|5|Elasticized waist band is key for us big boys. Nice fit in the legs and will have you feeling normal again. Stop torturing yourself with that one-size-down pair of tourniquet pants. Let it breath.
B00243FUQ0|5|I ordered this belt for my husband to wear with dress pants. The buckle is very attractive with a black and silver trim. The belt it true to size and nicely constructed. I got the black one and am now ordering the brown one.
B00CMDX3XO|5|Love these socks! Second time I have purchased.
B00C2DJ81K|3|It fit nice and gave me a good figure but the ends would fold inward and the stomach would bubble if I sat down and you could notice it under clothes. But I do notice my curves looks better and my stomach looks toned when I don't wear it
B002HJ377A|1|So after a week of anxiously awaiting the arrival of my wolf shirt couldn't wait to try out its magical properties.<br /><br />So after putting on the shirt and admiring myself in the mirror for several hours I decided to head out the streets...or as I like to call it \\"Going on the Prowl\\"<br /><br />After spotting my first target aka a \\"Foxy\\" Lady, I headed over to her and put this shirt to good use. While attempting put my wolf like moves on her, I got peppered sprayed in the eyes!<br /><br />What's up with that? I give it a one star for awesome shirt. But nothing more. Be warned this shirt has powers beyond my comprehension.
B00AIU17LS|5|Love it!
B000J43TBO|5|These are cute, fit great, good quality.
B000G1OM5W|5|It's the perfect wallet! There's plenty of room, but it doesn't overwhelm your purse. It's soft and the zipper works smoothly. I am very pleased with this wallet.
B0029T3Q3S|4|Bought this backpack for my little sister to take with her to day care.  Fits all of the necessities and she loves rolling it around with her.
B00D7UX1YM|4|Seems to be a good quality wallet with plenty of space for business cards, credit card and ID. Wish it had a couple windows for pictures.
B00HRX6XS6|4|This is a great high quality leather wallet.  Fossil makes great products for reasonable prices and this wallet will last.  Only bad thing to be said is no ID slot, but you have to take your ID out for everything you use it for anyway.<br /><br />Great product for a fantastic price
B002VWK5QY|3|Jacket is warm.  As has been mentioned, it fits a bit small.  For shorter folks, this is good.<br />Two things I have observed.  The inside pockets are parallel to the zipper.  Some may call these map pockets.  They close with a single snap.  However, when bending over, some items will fall out, such as eyeglasses. Now, the zipper.  On my jacket the slider has a gapped hoop that holds the metal pull.  In time, that gap widened allowing the tab to fall out.  I have approached tailors who want no part of the repair.  If they were to do it, the speculative cost would be about half the price of a new jacket.  I contacted both the retailer and Alpha.  The retailer could offer no advice. Alpha informed that the company has no zipper replacements and  suggested that I try a fabric and textile shop.
B00CO34OAI|4|Purchased for my girlfriend she loves them very good quality for the price, bought some other ones for alot more money, they do not compare to these for a whole lot less cost. Very happy she would buy these again.
B00FEW7FYS|4|Not top-of-the-line, but very sweet and simple. Comfortable fabric, a bit sheer, but nice. I will get more, and wear them in warmer weather.
B00B6EBO6I|4|I wear these long sleeve henleys instead of tees for forearm sun protection. I purchased them in black, desert sand, and black olive. These three colors are nice. Yes, the cotton is heavy. If it were any heavier these would be uncomfortable in summer -- too hot.<br /><br />At first the elastic wrist cuffs are uncomfortably tight, even on my thin wrists, but they loosen-up soon enough.<br /><br />I have other henleys that are thinner and a nicer cut, tapered better to look more stylish but for the price these cannot be beat.
B000J429MY|1|I love this product so I bought another set in a larger size. I was hoping to get the colours in the photo...the pink, purple etc. Howver much to my disappoint I got the same orange and blue assortment. I was highly annoyed as now my daughter now has 18 undies of the same colours. At least advise your customers if the colour of  product advertised is not in in stock and that another colour is being shipped. Give customers the option of either accepting or choosing something else. so the 1 star is not for the quality because the quality is quite good, it's for poor customer service! P.S. I would have returned the item but I'm from Trinidad and it would have taken too long.   very nice product.  could have had nicer colors though. I thought I was getting what I ordered instead I got another color assortment where four undies were the same color. other than that my daughter loves them.
B00OIRC2KC|1|I ordered a medium sweater and like the other reviewer, I received an extra large size. The extra large was too small for me and I suspect it could be a child extra large. Also, the seams at the both arms are already showing prior to me trying it on.
B005SXPB0I|5|Awesome
B0043XFKH8|5|This ia a great tie! Excellent price, material isn't the sturdiest but the color is great and I've had no sign of wear and tear after several uses.
B00CAJDYF2|5|Great great bra
B0044BBS3O|2|This bra is gorgeous--I really liked the way that I looked in it, so when it arrived and seemed a bit snug (smooshing my boobs together and creating over the top cleavage) I decided to give it a try anyway. Both the cup and band size seem smaller than measured. After about eight weeks, both cups started to tear near the nursing clips. Granted, I wore this one a lot, but I guess you get what you pay for. Should have gone with a pricier bra.
B006QT7PB6|5|This was exactly what I wanted. I couldn't find it in stores in January and we needed at fast so this was perfect.
B0076ZZUTI|5|This is exactly what I expected.  It fits loose enough to put a swim bra under. It's long enough to stay put and not rise up.
B008LWRDZO|5|Nice fitting pants. Great for moving and bending throughout the day at work. The fit was comfortable and flexible but formed nicely on my back side.
B00RJKTG8Q|4|Came on time. Great quality shorts but the lg was too small. Went by chart and it seems to run small. Will try to order a larger size.
B002IRXOI8|1|I bought this for my mom who had eye surgury.  It had an adult on the advertisement, but when I got it, the band was so tight around her head that the patch was actually pressing into her eye.  Wished I had kept the packaging so I could have returned it, but didn't.  So I just threw away my money on this one.  Unless you are purchasing for a small child, don't bother wasting your money.
B00IJV2YJM|3|A little smaller than I expected, but I can still wear it.
B00MWSUBKM|1|No way is this a large. Save your money and get something else.
B000G7BE7K|5|My grandson loved the sweatshirt, he was very pleased. It was a Christmas gift, thank you, we were so glad to find it.
B00AKW0S1E|2|Sadly these leggings are not true to size, the small was much too small.. perhaps a children's size? And the pattern was upside down :( which means the reindeer face down.
B00BU7CBV8|5|My kid has worn these so much and they now have holes in a few.
B005L4WREM|5|Shirt looks and fits great. The art on it is awesome and the back glows in the dark which is pretty cool.
B00BU1ZGPW|5|These pants are very comfortable and so soft. I was very happy with the fit and have these in black also.
B00HS45TUM|5|My son loves it.
B00EM8O5HK|3|I've had a Freya Patsy before, in the green and white color. It was fantastic quality and perfectly sized. This one ... not so much. The quality was noticeably cheaper than the green color, and seemed thinner yet more stiff (in an uncomfortable way). I'm about an FF-G cup in every other Freya and Fantasie bra, but the G was too small. I sized up to an H, and it was STILL too small. It's just not made right. I hope whatever Patsy comes out next is better made! It's a shame because I love this color combination.
B00LTT2FIG|5|Great pants.  I love the stretch material.  very comfortable. Whish they had more colors
B00CQR9R8Q|5|I liveon the East Coast and wear it most days.  Really enjoy the fit.
B00CN5B9QE|5|Great Value! Awesome product!
B00M9USIBW|2|Ok, if a woman needs a larger glove in width, it might just follow that she needs the LENGTH as well. Looks ridiculous. I should send it back. But if you have short smaller, wide hands, this could work for you.
B0065L8OVK|5|Awesome
B008728I8Y|5|My son was born in the beginning of October, he fit into the costume all the way up until Halloween, very warm for him and everyone loved the bunting how cute it was, I definitely recommend this to anyone with a baby!
B00CAE6R4C|3|These do what they are intended to do. Even though they are thin, they still feel bulky between the shoulder blades and is kind of uncomfortable to wear.  They came in a plastic package that was nearly ripped open when I received it so I'm glad the product was still in there.  I do love the mulitiple colors for flexibility though.
B00NLVHJ2C|5|These are attractive, lightweight, and perfectly sized.  My husband is 6'4&#34; and approximately 250 lbs.  They are very adjustable in the waist, and fall perfectly to the tops of his feet (he wears them just lower than his hip bones.
B0026RHEBS|1|It was too small. Had to return it. They should indicate that these are made smaller or tell customers to buy one size up from what you normally wear.
B00B1SJVBY|4|The only thing I would say was a little disappointing was that they were a thinner fabric than expected, so not quite as warm.
B00KDW7GVQ|5|Ordered the shirt for a Christmas gift. It got here sooner than I figured and is absolutely perfect for the person that will be receiving it!
B00LHO7CEU|5|very cute matching outfit
B00JBQX8QC|5|Brought for my niece's five year birthday and she loved the movie frozen as she dressed up as Elsa, the<br />Panties were a perfect gift.
B00DJNXDWW|1|They were very short in spite of saying that the stockings would fit someone 5'10&#34;  Waste of money
B00Y1GERYO|5|This is the best pair of jeans that I have ever purchased!  The legs fit snug without being tight and the waist size is right where it should be. The stretch of the product is minimal at 3% but I find it is perfect and has a lot to do with the overall great fit of these jeans. I plan on buying more of these jeans.  Update, on August 25, I purchased 3 more of these jeans.  They are absolutely great! There is a white tag on the belt area of the back of these jeans and it can be easily removed with a seam ripper, I mention this  so that you will know that it is removable.
B0090OOVJ8|5|these undershorts fit super comfy under my wetsuit. I can't even tell i'm wearing them. They dry super quickly too!
B003XQNXL6|4|I guess I don't have as much back side as the guy in the photo because there is plenty of room back there.
B00CBWZ9Z6|4|Super comfortable for a surgical bra.  Fit well and easy to put on with the limited shoulder movement after a breast procedure. Definitely recommend!!
B00N57SMGE|5|Very pretty and functional Leotard.
B003TMLP3W|3|Nice for extra pictures
B00CA1SOZK|5|This particular pattern is made out of very nice cloth.  Every pattern is made with different cloth.  Some are thinner, thicker...etc.  I have bought three different patterns of these pajamas and they all fit fine.  They are all cotton so they are comfortable even in the summer. My favorite set so far is this pattern. Feels very smooth and has a generous fit but not overly large. I am tempted to use them to lounge in!
B004UM7YUS|5|Great hat. Great price.
B002HEX20W|5|Goes with all of my shirts!<br /><br />Very comfortable yet very smart looking.<br /><br />thank you !
B00KSDLEYA|4|My son said they were a great fit.  I wish they came in more colors with more choices.
B00HVWSQG0|3|These socks fit just right on my size 6 feet.  Just wish the socks had a bit more pile to them.  More pile for cushion, not for warmth.  Wash up nice, dry fast.  Less $$ on the utilities to wash and dry.  Stays in place on foot, does not bunch up and cause bumps in your shoe.
B008SCNIBU|5|It was a gift for my sister and it fit her perfectly. She loves the shirt as much as she loves the Chargers.
B007OWNIQ0|5|Having slept in underwear for too long, the glorious freedom and softness inherent in Del Rossa Men's Soft Knit pajama pants is indeed the bomb.
B00JGH7CCM|4|Very cute, fit perfectly, granddaughter loves it!
B00IX5LQY8|5|I have these super cute booty shorts in blue and they have yet to let me down. I'm 5'4&#34; and 118 and they are the perfect length and don't get caught in any unwanted spaces (an issue for me because my bum is a little on the fuller side). I have yet to try them on the water, as I am a collegiate sailor but when I do I will be sure to write another review!
B000LV7EES|1|Extremely uncomfortable, the seam runs right along your breast and it is terrible. Ridiculously bad design. And the straps are too short, so even if the cup fits you, it will like dig into your shoulders. The straps are also way too close to the neck and impossible to cover unless you wish to wear turtlenecks everywhere.
B00DZ0TYX6|5|This is just beautiful.  It's wide enough to pull up over my head in wet or wind, it drapes naturally and beautifully, and it's a soft, unique effect that would be flattering on nearly everyone.  It does have a lot of volume as the picture shows, so perhaps on a very petite person it might be overwhelming, but on anyone of average size or bigger, it's a great purchase.  I haven't seen anything this nice in the stores yet.
B00HQQTWDW|3|The jacket is very sleek looking, but the sleeves are rather long and the size was larger than anticipated. The jacket is also not very warm. I was expecting to use this in 40 F weather, but it was not warm enough for that.
B004SP5RZ6|5|This has become my favorite hat. I had one very similar a few years ago but lost it somewhere on a trip out west, so I'd been looking for another since. It's got great sun coverage and you can roll it up to pack it and it looks just fine after you unpack. It has an elasticized band inside so it stays on your head very well unless it's really windy. I put a string on it so I wouldn't lose it even if it was really windy, like I lost the last one. I also put a scarf around it for color and to change the style a bit for different outfits. I really love this hat.
B009G9A9J8|4|The fit is somewhat small for someone who has a large head. I prefer my hats a bit deeper.<br /><br />That being said, I think this hat looks great. the embroidery of the skull is top notch. The other complaint I have is about the stitching on the bill. There is none, so under the bill, you have what feels like a taught sheet of fabric stretched across the bill. Doesn't scream quality. Even if it would have taken away from the embroidered aesthetic, I would have preferred to have at least a few rows of stitching on the bill.
B00FMTHYJY|5|excellent product meets its specification and arrived at the stipulated time
B001AD1UCS|5|My son loves it and has already worn it twice. Costume is roomy and is well made. Would highly recommend.
B003JQVHRW|5|The mask matches exactly to what is pictured in the image.  What is not mentioned in the description is that this mask is also soft and easy to wear, and has delicated beaded embellishments.  It it not horribly stiff material, so it feels fine against the face, yet durable enough to keep the buttefly wing shape.<br /><br />This product will work perfectly with the costume I have planned.
B00359V6GU|5|Great tie, great price. Goes with everything in my waardrobe.
B00C391ZEQ|5|Great product. Stays &#34;dry&#34; during workouts (more than normal underwear). U fly is the best I'm never using a conventional fly again. I would buy them again.
B008DIVL72|4|Comfortable jeans. As what the previous buyer commented, the zipper keeps coming down but it is ok because I  actually used safety pins to hold it up.
B004URNPT2|3|It's not so impressive in person. Not the quality of the other Chevy bowtie Items I purchased. I was disappointed but I still like it.
B00K6IAJBG|5|The dress fits perfectly, it looks just as the picture! And, it came way earlier than it was intended to; almost two weeks earlier! I love it, and I will most definitely be wearing all the time :)
B00QSO40MQ|5|Great quality love it
B00JGG7K4I|4|Very pretty & elegant looks very expensive mine had a little hole by the shoulder I don't know it is during shipping & handling. Other than that it looks very pritty.
B00D8TAL7C|4|Pants are great and look nice.  Just didn't expect them to be too big.  So, I ordered a smaller size and am waiting them to arrive.
B007KFZE3G|5|I've never had a sports bra that supports me enough to wear only one...now I do!!! I definitely recommend to anyone, but especially people with a larger chest.
B00118VHF2|5|The pants fit great.  They were as described and  I am very happy with them.<br />I would definitely recommend them.
B007GB8F08|5|I have decided I LOVE Leveret - bought for my infant - very cute.  I bought him another one that was extremely cute as well, and plan to buy more for his older siblings.  Fan.ta.stic. PJs for the kiddos - I had purchased holiday themed ones for my three children, plus a couple back-ups for our holiday photo cards, and was extremely pleased with the color vibrancy, fit, and fabric.  These went through the wash great - no fading/shrinking issues.  Given that, I've been on the prowl for other cute sets.  This one is adorable - I also bought another one that was great as well.
B00BEU1RK2|5|Great prop/mask for a world history teacher!  How did I ever teach without it?!?!?  :)
B00JST8Q8M|5|Soft and has not shrunk or lost its shape.
B00K8QTAVG|5|Good value, I'm short so I had to have it altered but love love love it
B00JTP4YB8|3|I wonder if is a replica 😁<br />Fabric is very thin<br />Stitches are cheap
B00BUDRKMW|1|This product did not smooth anything! All the other reviewers who gave it more than two stars I certainly don't see what they saw.
B000FAMDOQ|5|I bought this for my son and he loves it. Perfect for any Jeff Gordon fan.
B004A9UIN6|5|Only found these on Amazon. Keeps my toddler from crashing onto the wooden floor when running around in his socks. The non-slip dots appear to be made from silicone rubber. They have lasted through many washes and still going strong. My child has hurt himself many time from slips when wearing &#34;Hanes&#34; branded non-slip socks. Those don't work. These do. I haven't found anthing better yet.
B0066C71KI|5|These looked cheap but fit and feel great. Keep there shape even after hours of wear.  Can't find the same thing anywhere else. I have looked locally and found nothing similar or with the same quality. Luckily i also ordered an additional pair in blue. Would order again.
B00E6EORGO|4|but we will have it for next year!
B000X9AWC4|4|Great t-shirt, probably my new favorite! The fit is nearly perfect -- a little long for me but I had it tailored.
B001XON4E6|5|Well worth it, I can make my hats fit perfectly
B00NPX4X8O|5|Was better than I thought made a great gift she loved it goes with Black and white very happy .
B00IMV35RY|2|Really cheap fabric like a tarp that's thin enough to see through
B00IOB78BG|1|I usually wear a M, and couldn't get a L over my head. The sizes are for children. Get at least 2 sizes bigger!
B009JW0CJE|5|This is just what I was looking for. The fabric is light and stretchy, perfect to wear under a cardigan or tee.
B00DFU62BI|4|completely pleased with this shirt its soft, fits nice, love the attitude message, color is bright but in my eyes orange more than red
B00D4K3IOS|1|THIS CUTE SET TO BUY ME THAT CAME OREDENE WITHOUT PANTS, MUCH APPRECIATE THEM TO ME WHAT YA Mandarin PAYMENT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND ME REACH THE SAME WAY THAT MISSING PIECE
B00F24OIJI|2|Con's:<br />-  It ran very small. I have a size 35 inch waist. I ordered a size 36-inch belt  and it would not reach any of the loop-hole!<br />  I would order 2 sizes larger than you normally wear if you order.<br />-  Also, it is a thin leather, this is not a work belt or even close.  It is a fashion belt for someone who wants a rugged look.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />- Inexpensive price.<br />- Fast shipping.<br /><br />In the end I returned it because I was looking for a work belt to hang a hammer off of.
B00CKN7PYO|3|This shirt's material is a little too &#34;swimsuit-like.&#34; It's a polyester that reminds me of  rough dolphin skin.<br /><br />The cut is too cute for me to return it, but I honestly think that if anyone were to hug me in it, we might catch fire. It's a really rough polyester.
B005OO449K|3|I really love these jeans, they are cute and fit perfect. However, after wearing these jeans 3 times, I noticed the thread coming lose and causing snags :(
B00IMH91GC|4|Good product! But it was too small for my baby!
B00AXZAUWU|4|If you are a size large looking for a regular large, you must order a size bigger. I am a size large and was hoping this hoodie was perfect. It looks great but is a tad size smaller. I would order a size XL after ordering a size large and it feels like a medium. But it will look great on me after losing weight, baby weight. I'm never a size large. If you are medium,order large. Great looking hoodie but wrong size.
B000Y9CJ8S|4|would have been more helpful if the length had been specified.It's functional and easy to carry in a bag
B00MLHY5BA|3|The shirt itself was fine.  The problem was that the pins holding the shirt was rusted through and we had to use pliers to get them out. The pin holes were also rusted and stained.
B00KRHTLRE|5|They looked very nice and holds the tie firmly. A highly recommended tie accessory!
B00OP9AXP4|5|Love this dress! It was perfect for my fiancés surprise Star Wars birthday party! Buy a size larger than what you normally wear as it runs a bit small.
B007VDBQFW|4|these cords are really nice. they are true to size.  nice colour and great quality.  they are made of a super stretchy cord, so they are almost like thick leggings
B00C4OSK3Y|5|Bought this for my teenage daughter, she absolutely loves it!
B00O72G5OW|4|Didn't like neck line thought it would be softer
B004URO974|1|Pin came off the unicorn pin the first time it was worn
B00K2HLXEI|4|A lovely product!
B00ISQ353W|5|Dope! Really awesome look, and my friends love it too.
B000WN0HW6|5|I just lost one Fownes glove and was shopping for a similar pair but couldn't find any. Coming from Montreal, Quebec, I need a good pair of gloves and this one does the job for our cold winters, I just looooooooove them.
B0082J11SQ|5|I needed a good, sturdy buckle to go with a new leather belt that I also bought. It fit perfectly and was just what I needed. The belt and buckle look great together.
B00MZA9LY4|4|Arrived on time and good sizing. Nice material but I was a little disappointed that the lettering seems to be wearing off only after one wash and wear.
B0035XR57A|4|This is exactly what I expected.<br /><br />The sleeves are a bit long and the jacket a bit tight - but alas those are the trials of being a big guy.<br /><br />Good length.
B0012M2OFY|1|I hate this bra, the push-up pads inside the bra are hard and bulky, they stick out and give an terrible shape when wearing a t-shirt or knit top.  I would never buy or recommend this particular bra.
B005S6B0OG|5|Beautiful socks! Love them!
B000MGYG0M|5|I ordered this item a little over a year ago and LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  It came on time, packaged very nicely.  I am a photographer and I use it in some of my sessions.  It is a wonderful addition to my props.
B00HJS47NW|5|This is my favorite bra. 36 G.<br />I DO have to wear this on the loosest hooks, but it still fits. I'd size up in the band if I bought it again.
B0088A840M|5|Hits just above the knee, chiffon with layers, sparkly at the shoulders, tie in the back. Worked great for a semiformal school dance.
B004S5JEPK|5|Fits loose, and I have a big head.  The hat isnt incredibly warm but does the job in 20+ temps.
B005SOC100|5|These jeans fit well.  I have had several compliments already the few times I've worn it.  It's got a great button.  I love the stitching on it and the color is perfect
B00HD8O2HE|5|It's excepital nice, can't wait to show it off!<br />💞👏💖
B00AWB37KW|3|Fit was some what small but great bra
B00LN60GJA|4|Nice quality.
B003X0BCMY|4|InexpensiveCvery good! It is worth buying.Leather looks good too.But too few models on Amazon.  InexpensiveCvery good! It is worth buying.Leather looks good too.But too few models on Amazon
B00NL04G2O|5|Very nice.  Very soft and warm.  Just what I was looking for.
B00HE9UHGC|3|this is a very sexy very pretty bra, unfortunately the cups were slightly larger than expected. I felt glamorous wering it though! so if you are a bit bigger than a B cup but not quite a C this bra is for you! the fabric and make is delicate and very well done!
B00TEAYBFC|5|Nice shirt. Fits as expected.
B00J640D8U|5|It's a good quality shirt and I am glad to find they have it in my size.
B001EILYUM|3|He looked so adorable in this Easter outfit however, the sizing is just way off!  My son is a hefty 14 month old who only wears 18 month clothing.  Naturally I didn't want the costume to be way to small for him however, this was astronomically larger then him. To make it clear how large my boy's cousin who is turning 4 could fit in their and i almost could get his 10 yr old cousin in there too.<br /><br />*Bottom Line*<br /><br />Only reason why this didnt get 4 or 5 stars was because the sizing was way off so, whoever orders this in the future please go one size range down from the normal size your baby wears.
B00CX5TRO0|5|Excelente
B001FYCLW0|4|I ordered these gloves in order to bolster my winter protection as I'm a year round rider. The fit is excellent and the quality far exceeds my expectations when considering the price.
B003BFSPIU|5|I actually got this to replace the same thing that has gotten worn. So yeah, I like it enough to have purchased it again.
B00SAZ7VWC|5|The size is smaller than US sizes but the company is the best to deal with. They worked everything out perfectly. Just order a larger size than usual. Coat is great, lightweight and packable with a hood .
B0043O9S9S|4|These pants fit my son very nicely through the hips, thighs & legs.  The waist was oddly large, though, and they do not have a waist adjuster in the waist band.  They look good with a belt.
B00RWI8NHU|5|Amazing. Makes the girls look real nice ;) and flatters any body type.
B00LHZMTHE|4|Very warm and comfortable.  Well made.
B008DW10VA|5|My invalid husband always had cold feet and was uncomfortable.  We tried fleece footies but they wouldn't stay on and came off in the bed.  These socks are very well made, warm and stay on beautifully.  They are a tight fit and would not work over sore feet.
B00FAY4M14|5|This is a nice hoodie and a good price, It looks even better in person!! Fast shipping too. I would recommend
B00FQ7QQJG|5|It came on time, and it was a very nice scarf. The color is similar to the picture. However, it does have little sparkles on it that aren't visible in the picture. I like the sparkles, but some people may not.
B00GAST6WO|3|This was a strange fit for me. It gave me the appearance of a linebacker! I'm very thin and this added 10-15+ lbs. to my frame and more in the shoulders. Sending back. Too bad because I thought it would be gorgeous and more than worth the money :~( I don't understand all the great reviews unless they are trying to justify the purchase to themselves? And the buttons are awkward to say the least. I'd say, order down to make it really snug, if you're going for figure flattering... like I was. The seller was perfect and prompt. Hope this helps.
B0073J1OHY|4|These are nice looking sunglasses, and they fit my head well (I wear XL hats).  My biggest concern is that I don't think they feel particularly solid and take abuse very well.  They were also a hair more than I normally spend on glasses but were worth it.
B001F0PVJO|5|I ordered one of these in the saddle color. I've owned 2 black leather jackets (not this make) and I wanted something a bit different.  Usually, brown leather jackets are so dark they're nearly black.  Not this one.  The coloring is perfect for the look I wanted.  The jacket has a bit of heft/weight.  The leather is relatively thick yet buttery soft to the feel.  The Thinsulate lining is great as it enables it to be worn comfortably in 30 degree weather....anything colder and you should wear specific winter coat (except for maybe short trips outside).    The sizing is generous.  I am hard to fit being between a medium and a large coat size (I have a 41\\" to 42\\" chest and, in spite of being 6ft, have short 32/33 shirt sleeve arms)...I went with the medium for this jacket and it is just right.  Any bigger and it would be 'baggy' on me with hands hidden in the sleeves.  The only downfall is the jacket is a bit 'stiff'...probably due to the thickness of the leather.  The collar wants to hold its shape and when sitting down the jacket 'buckles' and pushes up into my neck...I have to billow it out manually.  I've come to the point where I unzip it to drive.  This is a minor complaint due to the great look of the jacket....I'm hoping it will 'break-in' (like a pair of shoes) around the collar a bit.  We'll see what happens over the years.  With its build quality, this coat will last years.    I saw some friends for dinner last night and wore this jacket.  I'm not usually complimented on my clothing but everyone LOVED this jacket on me.  I thought it looked good to myself but this was rock solid confirmation.    This is definitely a top notch quality coat that could easily sell for  $250+ at retail.  You'll be shocked you got such an excellent quality coat below $100 price point.  BUY ONE, you won't be disappointed.
B00JV305E8|5|Fits well, so soft, washes well, and doesn't get pilly. The colors go well with everything our baby wears. The straps are long enough to tie or for baby to play with as he explores the world to his new eyes. The brim is just long enough to be cute, but doesn't cast a shadow. I'd recommend this hat for any baby.
B004DV4TEK|5|I bought this shirt in black and LOVE it. Get a lot of compliments. I like that. Good quality shirt. Highly recommend.
B00OWHGFLK|4|Product is as described. Material quality seems very good as does workmanship. Fit is right on with the sizing guide. Color is great for matching with other &#34;natural&#34; tones. Overall I really like the product but I should have read the description better; I thought the mittens folded over like some other brands, this is not the case.<br />My child can use his hands better in this than with socks on his hands!
B00DQ4CO0G|5|I will definitely buy again. I ordered the white and gray ones to wear under my scrubs. They got here in only two days. Everything was packaged nicely and the shirts were folded. But keep in mind that the fabric is thin and it is tight on the arms. It is perfect for layering. Great price too!
B00PQ8EX1I|5|Great maxi dress! My daughter loves this dress. It's a great length for a maxi, just right, not too long. Nice, bright colors. My daughter wears it every week to school. Washes well, no shrinking or fading. Highly recommend.
B00AMWNME2|5|I was impressed with the quality of the ties I received. They look exceptional considering the low price for them. I am also impressed how fast they arrived. The ties were shipped from China and arrived in around eight days after being mailed.
B0051D4Q8S|5|I love Lee Jeans.  They always fit just right and last a long time.  Can't go wrong with this brand at all.
B00ODONSJO|5|I bought these for my grand-daughter.  She loves them.
B001PO6CZC|5|I love these tank tops way better then the fruit of a looms. I usually get the DKNY and Addidas tank tops, you cant go wrong
B00CS1SN58|5|This carter's set is so cute. Carter's products are the best.  prompt shipping and priced well. Thanks, Peggy Always washes up well with no fading.
B00GY1Y5WI|5|This set was a birthday present and it looked very neat and was well made. It should be very functional in a busy little boy's world!
B003VCRRVE|5|I purchased for a friend and she absolutely loved the cuffs. We are seniors just attempting to try belly dancing.
B00KGNZS1W|5|Great wallet but horrible wait time! I placed my order on August 27th and after the order was placed, the company told me they'd ship it out and I would get it between September 23rd THROUGH October 9th! However, it did come in on September 13th which was a very pleasant surprise! And the &#34;package&#34; it came in was just a clear plastic bag wrapped in another black plastic bag with the address labels (not very pleasant packaging but I guess you get what you paid for).<br />The actual wallet itself had a VERY strong chemical odor! It didn't really smell of just leather goods, it had a strong combing chemical odor to it but lucky the odor dispersed within 2 days (as soon as I got it I emptied out my old wallet to use this one, placed it/kept it in my purse the entire time and the odor went away on its own and it didn't transfer the odor to my purse or the other things in there). The wallet is of good quality, all the stitching on the outside of the wallet and pattern on the wallet is perfect! Also, the golden zipper around the wallet is strong and durable, however...the decorated chain/zipper pull tab is super cheap! Very poorly made! I'm currently in the process of switching it out with something else once I visit my local Jo Ann's (craft/fabric store). And once you open it up, some of the stitching on the inside is a little off, but no one will see it or notice it unless you look really close at it.<br />Other than that, I love this wallet! I got the navy color and it's beautiful! (Looks black in low light but navy in natural lighting)
B009VMUI64|2|I actually had to return this shirt.  The XL shirt was very small, and also short.  I don't believe it would have held up after too many washings.  If you do buy this shirt, make sure to get a larger size than normal.
B0098YM160|5|I bought this to replace a poor quality shirt which came with a tuxedo set - was pleasantly surprised at the quality and fit of the shirt for the price. I would definitely purchase this brand again if needed in the future.
B008LWQH2O|4|Slightly loose in waist but wears and washes well. Perfect length for my height -- 5'6.
B0025U3IUW|5|its a tie, meh. what can i say. Lol... its nice and passable, its my emergency spare tie, the kind that wont hurt yr wallet if something happens to it. :)
B00IMG4GTU|5|Loved the shirt!!
B00M27Z6O4|4|Wish it were a little longer, overall a good shirt.
B00BJOI602|5|Perfect for winter/cooler months. My wife ordered 5 of these and she loves the comfortable cotton fabric. The patterns are great and she highly recommends them. They fit somewhat large (not the sleeves, just the pants) but she loves them.
B003FWJPNI|5|Nice
B00C6QS0XK|5|These were a prize for my violin student, and they're wonderful. The order arrived on time; each one was clean and neat. I like how they have the pin attached to the main round frame instead of having a separate backing piece that could get lost.
B00ICVLRT2|2|It did fit, but the quality of the print on the shirt is atrocious. I'm still wearing it because it looked faded and retro at first but now, now it's coming off and I've not even had the shirt for a month.
B004N8P2HQ|5|I like the shirt, but I'm not so sure if it will continue to look nice after being washed.<br />I am giving it as a gift, so I hope the material stays looking good.
B006MYF0DK|5|This is an absolutely gorgeous dress, I could not be more glad I got this!! My only issue has been trying to keep the top of the dress on my shoulders- especially when sitting down, and gravity isn't helping as much. It is a really beautiful dress, but I recommend investing in some clothing tape!! [[ASIN:B0027ZCXRO BRAZA S1009 Body & Clothing Double Sided Flash Tape]]
B003VTZPSE|3|I bought this outfit for my daughter and I like the quality and the color, however, it runs quite small. The 6-12M size was already too small at 9 months and she's average height and weight. The openings for the hands and feet are tiny.
B00FVREDEQ|4|It fit a bit small but very popular at the 4th of July barbeque!!
B00BNUQ9QK|3|a bit too large and no so thin
B00OCIEA4S|5|So cute! Love it.
B00BLCNLBQ|3|I love the color.  I order a small in the dark blue and light blue because I read they ran big (I normally use medium).  What I found out is that they are very inconstant with sizes.  The dark blue was huge, it felt like it was XL but it was labeled small.  The light blue did fit but it was a tiny bit snug.  Quality was good.  Price was good.
B000XTHOA2|5|This wallet is great! I've been carrying a huge wallet in my purse, and the whole thing just got too heavy. This wallet is perfect for carrying what I need without the extra weight. Very well organized, and I have a separate small change purse, so that was not an issue. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to 'lighten the load' in their purse.
B007KFZFO4|5|I am a full figured woman that likes to work out and move around in the gym. I don't like for certain parts of me to move around and bounce. This sports bra is perfect. It is virtually bounce free, even when I am jogging or doing jumping jacks. i strongly recommend this sports bra.
B00DY8QIOM|5|Love it
B00DG6WLB6|5|My other half enjoys this show so much i got him this wallet! He was ecstatic upon getting it for his birthday! Thanks Amazon!
B003V4ALA6|5|This belt is just great. Don't buy the belts that feed thru and have a locking system like that. This is easy and adjustable but no stress on the ratchet locking system. It's great if your losing weigh  just trim a little off and re lock it with a simple push. Get this belt 100%<br />In my option
B000A38G12|5|This is a well-made, comfortable, not-too-heavy denim shirt, which I'll probably be using a lot for just hanging out, not just work.  I definitely plan to buy a few more of these shirts.  And, best of all, the sizing is right; too many shirts made overseas tend to be way too small for the labeled size.  These are right on the money, for a big guy like me.
B004GXA71O|2|Honestly the quality is the reason I gave this bra 2 stars but in over other aspect it's not worth the price.  It's band run really small compared to normal bras and I would not consider this high impact.  I'm a 36DD and am bouncing everywhere.  I've only ever worn champion in the past so I can say from experience their other high activity bras hold you down much better.<br /><br />I would keep looking for the price!
B003P2VQ8A|5|Thank you there were very good I am very happy with them.  Lyn
B00DM27COU|2|the mask is a super cheap foam mask with an elastic band. Think crap 70's style mask
B00GHNLQ2U|2|I had my last Dollhouse jacket for over 5 years, and its still going strong, but I wanted to splurge and get a new style (haha), Im picky as hell and thought i'd try this jacket.  I tried it on, and buttoned the jacket closed and the button was only a thread away from falling off, I put my hands in the pocket, and there was a hole in the lining! Yeah, so it got sent back.  I like sturdy jackets and this definately is not.  I found a pretty Carhartt jacket that will last me another many years :)
B002QO8FD2|5|Just received today and love this hat already. Perfect fit, light weight, and the vent holes work well. Will be excellent to wear on my upcoming Philippines trip! Highly recommended!
B00I3OX1OC|4|I ordered this for my 18 month-old to wear in our Christmas photos and she looked absolutely adorable!  She's very small for her age, so I think it will last her for quite a while.  She's very active so the ends have become a bit frayed, but it's still very pretty.
B00E0ILBKG|5|EXCELLENT
B00UV7TTCM|2|Suit was cute and felt well made, but the bottoms were Brazilian cut (showing a fair amount of butt cheek) which I did not see advertised in the product description.  The small top fit (I'm a 32B) but the bottoms were way too small (I'm a size 4/6 US).
B00DQYXERI|4|too thin
B00BXEEWAG|5|Good product.
B002WP1VHC|5|This scarf is long enough for a big man, soft enough for said big man.  Very nice scarf and came in a gift box which was a nice bonus.
B007M679MW|5|It did come smaller than expected, but only in length. It is definitely cropped. It's perfect for me though!
B0079MGPTW|5|The shorts are exactly how they are described and they fit great!
B00LVRC0AO|5|The coat was exactly what we expected but was slightly too big.  Unfortunately, needed it too quickly to exchange or the right size and had to grab a local coat for more money to be ready for European departure.  I would strongly recommend this coat.
B000FJRVX0|1|I ORDERED THIS BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED A JACKET THAT LOOKED FEMININE AND THEN I RECEIVED AN EMAIL THAT IT WOULD BE HERE IN APRIL DONT SELL IT IF YOU DONT GOT IT  OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE
B00SWT5EPW|5|I've bought several pairs of these shorts. They feel great and I really love them.
B00JMENHQY|5|cute gift
B00B3T7P50|3|This is the style of sweater I was looking for.  I would have ordered more in other colors but the fiber content of the yarn is of poor quality.  After only a month of use it is looking tattered.
B002208B8O|5|Easy to wash and wear. Great fit.
B007BFPUHU|3|I don't consider myself tall, 5'3\\" and these pants were on the verge of short on me.  They are light weight, seemed like a well put together pant.  I wear a size 0-2 jean and these pants were somewhat bulky in the behind and lower belly area.  I would have sent them back because of their length anyway but they were also very dorky looking!
B00L5L6GXI|5|LOVE IT!
B00KX1VVUO|5|I ordered this belt to go with a vintage dress, but, it has also turned into an excellent replacement for another belt that I used to wear with a few &#34;office&#34; outfits, which was wearing out.  I'm VERY happy with this belt!
B00LWF150Q|4|Fit as expected!
B00LA54BPY|4|Its very comfortable. I love it, keeps me warm, its a bit big but would definitely repurchase nevertheless.
B00NU9XSL6|4|The material is wonderful but I like my PJs a little roomier. Size L is usually a good fit for me so disappointed. I should have tried them on before I washed them and I would have exchanged for a larger size.
B00DJ62G9K|5|We found this bra for my daughter after trying on literally 30 others and it's the only one that she will wear.  So, of course, I buy her one in every color!  I was very happy to see a larger variety of colors on Amazon than in the stores.  The quality is great, the price is average for a good bra.  The color of this &#34;flame&#34; has a lot of pink in it.  It's not red.  Shipping was speedy, no issues.
B00IJHJEY4|5|These dresses are so fun and comfortable! Nice fabric and won't lift in the wind.
B00AF2OM3Y|5|Comfortable and pretty!
B00BDURK1S|2|I order this product twice in the same color (white) and it came in two different material and they were tight for XL, I had too find where I was away on vacation!
B0098F1Z0C|4|I purchased a<br />ililily Leather Bill Newsboy Flat Cap Cabbie Gatsby ivy Irish Driver Hunting Hat (flatcap-510)<br />and I loved it.  I wanted two more but they didn't have the colors I wanted so I looked for more ililiy caps and I found this and a beige one and expected them to be the same quality.  Turns out they are different but still look great.
B00KHB8TJ6|4|Really love these. They are a bit see through. But I love that they hug my legs all the way down to the ankles .
B004UPUAJW|5|This was the cutest halloween costume EVER! My little one was 6 mos old when she wore the small, it fit well and shes a little taller than average.  No breakouts or rashes and she didnt mess with it much.
B005N7OW2M|5|My daughter loves her new winter coat.  It is a bit big for this year, but I ordered a size up.  I like to get two years out of coats if I can ;)
B00NGVTUTW|5|so soft inside
B005FXAD8Q|1|I have purchased Large/Regular size several years ago direct from Dickies Company.<br /><br />The current Large/Regular is much too big and I have replaced with Medium/Regular.<br /><br />Quality of the product is very good after getting the size problem corrected.
B003UBP4OI|5|Do you know someone who can't wait to have someone else fix an electronic, or can't wait to ship it back and all that? Do you know someone who tears things apart just for fun? If so, this shirt is for them! There is one in every family and in my family the one I bought for, voiding a warranty doesn't always mean \\"voiding\\" a product ..in fact I trust my brothers work over Geek Squad any day, even if voiding a warranty is the case. Cool Shirt!
B00PIHICO6|5|Stunning - absolutely gorgeous!
B002HHK9PU|5|My daughter recently learned to walk and these are the only shoes I can get her to keep on.  Now she even grabs them out of the bag whenever she is ready to go outside for a walk!  She's starting to outgrow her pair so we are buying a larger pair! LOVE these shoes... plus we get so many compliments on them!
B00GB0RBJQ|1|The shorts fit well, but are not durable.  I bought 4 pairs on two separate occasions.  The first two pairs have been worn only 2-3 times, and the fabric is tearing by the inside of the rear pocket flaps.  I do not use my rear pockets, so over-extension is not an issue.  I
B00ENM0BFK|5|great value. . .
B00JQZOHNQ|4|Nice purse. For my expectations it is little big it fit in my bag.good quality. Good for gifting. I bought 2 for gifting
B00D3WPALQ|5|They actually stay on her feet!
B00ABNEQIS|2|Was listed as mens xl was like a glove on me fit my 5' 115 lb daughter
B004WZ942E|5|My daughter is almost 2, I bought the 2T and it fits a little loose which is a good thing.  She freaks out if anything fits tightly going over her head and this is roomy in the neck hole.  I like that it is UV 50, we live in Maui and are frequently at the beach.
B00K4KV2YO|4|Nice colors and nice pattern... it's just way too hot. These are rather winter socks, and I didn't know that when I bought them. So just pay attention to this detail.
B006Z2CJXS|5|This shirt is very stylish and also very comfortable. It's also organic cotton. My daughter loves wearing it and she is very picky  about what she puts on her. If it's not comfortable and soft I can not put it on her. I bought other items from them and they are all great!
B0098LY9P4|4|This is a good quality, fairly large case that will easily accomodate longer cigarettes if needed. The extra pocket on the side is handy as well. Good quality case for the money.
B00A3XYGNQ|2|I think I got rid of this after not very long. It didn't keep the wind off my ears.
B00LJ5JUCY|5|Ok.<br />So I am 69&#34; tall, 188 pounds, 35 inch waist. I ordered an XL. I am tall so I wanted a cincher that was longer. This is perfect for my torso. Ann Chery products are simply the best. So in the XL, I feel like I have a fist wrapped around me squeezing my stomach. Haha. I think I have a large ribcage for a woman so I actually wear this upside down so I can breathe. It still squeezes my belly down and makes me look amazing in my clothes. Yesterday I wore it for 3 hours, today I'll try to wear It longer. It was very hard to put on. I almost didnt think I would be able to get it to close. You have to have a good amount of arm strength and know how to suck it in. I'm glad I ordered a smaller size. I don't work out and I don't think I would work out in this just yet. It's a bit tight and I feel I might pass out if I tried working out in it! I have alot of anxiety issues as well so the restriction I feel is a bit uncomfortable to my anxious mind. For now I think just taking my kids for a long walk every day is good enough. I sweat alot in this thing just cleaning the house.<br />All in all this is a very sturdy product and I would recommend this to anyone.
B002W8LPKC|5|I grew up loving watching two things...Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers! That was about 20 years ago that my love for MMPR started and it has been quite a dry spell to let people know what I watched when I was in preschool. So the purchase availability for this shirt was a great opportunity for me to really let everyone know! What's also great is the fact that I have to type so many characters so that Amazon can get off my back about reviewing my items!<br /><br />TL;DR- The product is great, and so is the seller. Will buy more.
B0044QCYIW|2|Pay attention to the sizes. They are not as we expect in US. If you wear XL in the US - don't even bother. They are made for very slim frame. You need to have thin arms, tine chest to fit to this shirt. Otherwise - I like the design and material is OK
B00IZ38GL4|5|I love this thing. I love everything about this thing. I love the g-string that comes with it, I love the see-through gown. It's amazing. My girlfriend says it's comfortable, she admitted that she feels sexy in it, and it's just... ah. I'd highly, highly recommend this to anyone wanting a little extra spice. Definitely worth the price I paid for it.<br /><br />Did I mention, I love this thing?
B00Q4JWEVE|1|Omg! Where do I begin. . First the color is way off. Its more like a cheap highligther orange. The straps are way too thin. Not high wasted more like putting on big underwear. And im only 5'2 so it should of been waaay higher up. The tassels are like little pieces of cheap plastic that'll tear as soon as you mov,and there is only a few of them on there. ..waited weeks for this suit n paid almost$20 buck. Not satisfied
B009EDXZIS|5|Awesome tank for hands free pumping. It fits very well. It also washes well...no shrinking.  It's so convenient for nursing. I don't have to change clothes in order to pump. I love it and would highly recommend it.
B000KGOHLM|5|Great Hats!
B007IRM1LY|5|These are great tee-shirts.  I wish I could find the tall versions in stores, but have been unable to do so.  These fit the bill.  They're a little pricey, but worth it, in my opinion.  Definitely more substantial than some of the Haynes version.
B00M1B0ZII|2|Nylon texture. Fine for price
B00DOZME0W|5|The Bali bra was very nice and the sizing was correct.  I think it<br />I'll be very comfortable wearing it at my grandson's wedding in<br />July.<br /><br />Jane S.
B00HSE4KQ6|5|excellent seller very satisfied
B00JB7K10C|5|Soft, washes like a dream.  I use this as a petticoat under my full skirts and dresses
B003GXFTU4|5|THIS WAS PURCHASED AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY SON IN LAW AND ARRIVED QUICKLY. IT LOOKS LIKE JUST THE RIGHT WALLET, WELL MADE AND THE PLAID MAKES IT QUITE ATTRACTIVE, JUST AS PICTURED.  LOOKS LIE IT SHOULD LAST FOR YEARS AND HAS ROOM FOR EVERYTHING. SURE THE RECIPIENT WILL BE PLEASED.L NOTE: PURCHASED AT AMAZON
B000MT9KEG|5|Best socks I've had in years. I don't have diabetes but the no seam feature makes my trainers comfortable all day. Which is saying a lot for someone over seventy. Will buy again & encourage everyone to do so also.
B008DZU83S|4|Can anybody tell Mr what size to get I'm 5'5 and I weigh 240 I have stomach butt and thighs
B00TQ8FFOS|5|Love it! Great robe!
B0032Z1S5Q|2|Hi amazon.com, I had to order size 40 because size 38 was really a size 36. Now I'm happy since size 40<br />fits me correctly. Who ever sells Dickies WR640 Relax Fit Multi- use pocket must tell before purchase that you<br />must size up like 38 to 40 waist. We don't need to pay for extra shipping and wait another week. Please correct<br />sellers that deal with Amazon. Thank you Mr. Norman Kunz
B00MTH18GC|4|Cute
B00246XADM|2|I bought this costume too go trick-or-treating with my little cousins. I normally wear about a size 6 in clothing and figured the medium would fit fine. When I went to try it on, it was way too small. The costume fit fine width wise but it just wasn't tall enough. I am a fairly tall person - about 5'9\\"- so it probably would have fit a shorter person fine. I did go out and buy a large and it just fit. If you are tall make sure and buy a larger size!
B00JJHC5YO|3|they were a snug fit for my large hands, I had to snip the pinky a tad to get my finger in there... but with some pre.wearing to help them adjust to your hands, the gloves will fit just nicely... and they look fancy too.
B00CZ5012K|5|Fast shipping.  Love the product
B001HDZ6X0|5|Our granddaughters have quite a number of princess dresses; this was the first fairy outfit.  They love it and think it is just lovely. It has lots of layers of material, so the skirt stands out well.  I did iron it, because when it came out of the package, it was fairly unrecognizable. It is easy to iron and it makes all the difference in how it looks.      A real hit..
B00C6ZX5MW|5|I was just thinking this morning that I needed to purchase more of these in other colors.  Very, very comfortable, well-fitting, and good-looking pair of pants.
B00400O41W|5|Very nice! I love it.
B0084Y99LA|5|Very cute shirt and runs true to size :) my little boy loves curious george so this shirt was a hit!
B004SWIXPU|4|These are great pants for me. I train dogs and these pants are wonderful, perfect pocket locations and allow me to be flexable running walking and not to hot. I will buy more.
B00N04QWL4|5|Better than expected! Bought a size up due to other reviews and fits great! Sexier than I thought it would look! Only thing is the top is a bit bigger than I like for a swimsuit, but that's probably due to me ordering up. Well see how it goes when I go into the water!
B00IBB0W76|3|Too much sequence work on it..was a bit rough for my daughter to be in the whole day
B007EBANXM|5|My advice get a size larger....read a comment some one suggested get a size larger they are right.
B007XMQ2L4|5|I purchased 2, for my 10 And 8 year old sons. They loved them! Its very warm but allows them to move and play freely.
B00BMDEYH4|5|One of the most beautiful colors I have ever had. I love this gown
B000BRMGJU|5|A fairly good fit as received. My size is 7 3/4 or XL which I've found hard to find. This hat is that size and so far it stays on my head when working outside and is not too tight. It might get a bit looser over time which in my case should prove acceptable.
B00ET1V0AK|5|I bought these when some pregnancy weight made my regular underwear a bit too tight. These fit just as expected and they're comfortable.
B00RLD4VV8|5|I purchased this dress as a last minute dress to wear to a dinner. I didn't have any expectations of it...but was very surprised. The dress is extremely comfortable and flattering! Unlike most sequin dresses it is not heavy and doesn't pull on you. The pattern gives you excellent curves and is so lite that you can dance all night in it! I LOVE this dress!
B004PKTU5M|5|Love this product, however mine was missing the top hook so it would secure at the top. I should have returned it for a new one, but I was too excited to try it. This definitely gives you more confidence after you have your baby. You have to wear it a lot to help train your waistline. I could feel everything being pulled in.
B007X0NQXS|5|This pajama top is comfortable, correct size, I liked the soft material material, love the v-neck. I should have bought two!
B002IF1V4E|5|Great costume! We added a zipper to the back for closure
B00NVMWNBI|5|Sweatshirt is soft and looks nice. I am 5' tall and about a size 4-6 (chest size 36D) and I ordered a medium. It is a little roomy but maybe it will shrink a little, I haven't washed it yet. Only minor downside- I thought the heart was a patch, like an iron on or something but it is inked onto the fabric, like silk screened. I'm still pleased with my purchase and will probably order more stuff from YogaColors.
B006Z8HDUQ|5|I love this tank. I bought it to go under a shirt I bought for Christmas that was a bit see through. I was surprised on how soft the material was. The fit was true to size.
B00OOESFA0|4|Best work out top I ever brought....love it.
B000NPMJAG|3|I have always loved Levi 501 Button Fly jeans. I have never flinched a paying a bit more for them since I wear them often.  On 2 of the last 3 pair I've bought, the inner leg near the crotch has worn out quickly...like a few weeks. My partners' 501's did the same. They fit loosely enough. I can only blame the quality of the material.    I guess I must learn to wear something else but I would prefer it if they would increase the quality.
B00KI415HU|5|This is the magical piece of clothing I have been seeking my entire life.  I put this on and went to the club right after I got it.  I paired it with my red G-string and even with my moobs and fat belly hanging out, I rocked it.  It's like people just can't stop staring at you.  I got more ass than a toilet seat.  If you want to get some action or even hook up a threesome at the club , wear this.  It's irresistible.
B00MCQALIQ|5|Nephew loved it - good quality
B004A7XXZS|2|A size 8 would be better.
B002DVV6ZM|5|I have a special edition green-on-black pair of these. They are super CLEAN. I would never skateboard in them, although that was what I bought them for. They were just too darn comfortable.
B006W4NLJK|5|Love the fit, the styling, and the look of this classic white shirt (with a little bit more details)! I'm 5'11\\", 173 lb, US med, 32 waist and the Asian XL (US L) in this brand suits me perfectly! I've purchased 5 or 6 Doubljiu shirts/polos/ls t-shirts and always bought the Asian XL without any issues, even after washing.
B00JQGJ9CO|4|Love the shirt and it doesnt shrink when i wash it! Only thing is that the sleeves are a little weird for me.
B00IJOLS7S|5|Really nice shirt - will probably order more, in different colors. Lasts well in the wash too!
B0051D7N10|3|Many companies now produce pants in three lengths. Why doesn't Amazon sell more pants that are in short length? I am 5'7&#34;  and do not wear 6&#34; heels with my jeans. Medium pants these days are too long. Please, Amazon, let's see some short length pants available.
B005WV42EW|5|Nice and soft on the inside
B00BOCFUNK|5|Our little guy loved it!
B00NTONLT6|5|good
B007HAH590|4|I ordered a small and I'm originally a x-small. I'm going to guess that the jackets run pretty true to size because the small is a little big on me but easily fixable with the hip cinches. I ordered a maroon and it look just how I expected, not light or faded looking! shipping was a nightmare though it took 2 weeks for the jacket to come in because it was &#34;mis-shipped&#34; but when I contacted the seller through Amazon they were very helpful in getting the situation fixed.
B004421VCG|5|Great shirt stands by its size, as the shirt says, if you love Aiden this is for you, seriously love it c:
B00UYLG9KA|3|Beautiful, but tight at bottom hem so I'll have to alter it to wear it comfortably.
B00B6EAIAG|5|They are perfect fit!! Finally found a pair that fits just right.
B006NZPZ8I|5|These collar stays have become a staple item for all of my point collar dress shirts, as the plastic stays just don't seem to last in my house. While there are fancier stays offering adjustable lengths, bottle openers, and just about everything in between, these are just solid, go-to stays that get the job done. Definitely worth the rediculously low cost.
B004LRO3RY|5|This dress is so cute:) Im a size small and bought a small. Tiny bit loose but not noticeable. Unless you want skin tight go for a xs.
B008PDC1NS|5|The size runs a little large which is good.  Came out of the washer and drier in good condition; didn't shrink
B00H898B0W|3|I recently bought this shirt for my husband's birthday. Upon opening it we realized that the &#34;slim fit&#34; is too small and needed to return the Large size I ordered and get an extra large. The shirt is badass but is made as a &#34;slim fit&#34;. Now we are just waiting until we get the correct size. Cool shirt!
B009ENDT84|1|WONDERFUL! I LOVE IT! I HIGLY RECOMEND IT. You won´t regreat . Get one! I loveeeeeeeee it so much :))
B00CB3GOJK|5|Great shirt, just ordered wrong size. I was at the Red Rocks show for this tour.
B00UUS2ELU|5|Wish I could give it six stars!  1 of the most fabulous dresses I have purchased in a long time. The fabric is so nice & soft and seems really well made. I'm like a US size 14/16 dress and this XL is perfect. This is two totally separate pieces which is great because they can both be worn with other things. I bought 2 dresses from Idea2Lifestyle & they were in cellophane sleeves, bundled in a beautiful floral scarf! What a nice surprise! And the insert from the company that tells about their wonderful working conditions/retirement benefits for their staff & ethical materials like using only naturally shed peacock feathers from village farmers was a delight. Will buy more and more from this wonderful company!  I received it in only a few days.  I imagine that sometimes they are out of stock and need to order more, but mine arrive really fast.
B00FXPTD7S|2|I'm 6'5, 240+, 38&#34; waist. I need XXL in a lot of clothing, but I SWIM in the large sweater. I could deal with the sleeves and shoulders, but it billows out at the bottom with all the extra material. You'll look pear-shaped.
B00BZ61T1M|3|I'm 5'10 I bought an X-small I typically wear a med but I read the earlier reviews how it ran large. The xsmall fit perfectly but it was way too short on me but that's nothing leggings can't fix.
B00DEH4P0W|5|My husband loves these kind of slippers. He is a size 12 in mens and the XL fits just right!
B00OU6JVX2|2|To long wanted XL but regular length.
B004L6OYF6|2|Its super cute but my daughter is now wearing 24 months and the straps on these are still to big as is the waist around the bottom...
B00ADCBBNU|5|The very best second or third layer for winter time.  :)  It is super soft, very well made, very good at insulating, and it fits perfectly!  It says &#34;Hand wash only&#34;, but I've been washing it in a nylon garment bag on delicate cycle, cold water and it is holding up just fine.  It is air dry only, but it really doesn't take more than a couple of hours to dry, if you lay it flat.<br /><br />So, don't let the washing instructions turn you off;  it's definitely worth a little extra work for the price and quality.  I will definitely purchase more in the future!
B00I1LS7ZU|5|Love these shorts!  Very comfortable
B002G9UDY6|5|It's a Carhartt - made well, fits perfect, a great hat!
B0079MI3B0|3|I CAN USUALLY WEAR A MENS LARGE THIS SHIRT IN XL IS A BIT SMALL FOR ME SO I RECOMEND GETTING A SIZE LARGER THAN YOU USUALLY WEAR
B00ISX03TE|4|It's a little small, but otherwise it seems like a decent piece for the price point.
B000MWV7QC|3|It was too small so ordered next size. It barely fit but I decided to wear it and see if it stretched. I have other 18 hr ones in 38 and 40 back close that fit ok so must be the front close ones may run smaller. I am going to have to return the size 40.
B00C9J5YVU|5|Would recommend to anyone
B00OUDK1DO|4|My son loves Olaf he was very excited to get his new sweater.
B00JS6R7AS|3|Fit good but a little bit small
B00BXOC4JC|1|lasted less than 6 months
B00M92IFOU|1|Mine came from Jiang Store Service, which meant the learners were sent direct from China. The warmers did not look like the ones in the picture. They were cheap, thin, and a weird brown grey color instead of grey. They also smelled very bad which meant the original and sealed in cellophane made it worse. To return them, I have to pay postage to China. This is wrong. I'm very unhappy.
B00BG3NTTE|5|I am so happy with this dress, a friend of mine said that I look like Jessica simpson with it. very agree with my purchase!!!
B00CPJDMUE|5|Fit so well on my head and easy to fit bobypns in
B00F4ODNL0|4|awesome material. very stretchy and  fits really nicely. 250 lbs....flits like a glove. =)
B001P2WQW2|5|Just what I expected. The hat is not flimsy, or of poor quality. It feels and looks good and is a great fit. I can't wait to wear it in the sun. I would recommend this seller to others to purchase hats.
B00BGGE8BO|5|Love it nice quality shirt
B00LVRMQZ8|1|The big blue plaid in the picture is not what we received. We received a smaller blue plaid shirt.  The description does not state that it's going to be a different plaid. As consumers we rely on the picture of the product, which should be accurate, hence the 1 star.  Disappointed, however the fit worked well and due to price we just kept it. Would really like to purchase this beautiful blue large plaid shirt, but weary of ordering another shirt and getting a different pattern.
B000VK2BLK|5|I absolutely love this bra! It is the only one that I have found that actually supports like a bra should!  I got tired of the underwire type bras and decided to give this a try. I was pretty worried to not have that underwire there anymore until I wore this the first time.  It is soooo much better than the underwire bras and more comfortable.  I feel like this bra is actually much more supportive than an underwire and I don't have to worry about the wire digging in to my skin, or as the bra wears...coming out of the side when I least expect it.  I have to get a large cup size which is hard to find in a supportive style.  It is so great that they make this in a size I can wear.  It is so convenient to order this from Amazon and since they offer free returns you can order and try them on at home and if they don't fit you can get the right size.  This bra is well worth the effort to try.
B00EK93YXM|5|This dress is beautiful, great quality, looks very good.<br /><br />I highly recommend if you are thinking twice about this dress.<br /><br />I absolutely love it! Very comfortable.
B0081OUC9Q|5|A very soft non-itchy tutu petticoat. I was worried it would be squished weird when I ordered it but once fluffed out it looks perfect! It is very short, great for wearing under a fluffy minidress or skirt. Too short for me to wear by itself as a skirt, but I'm 5'6&#34; and 130lbs with a curvy butt so if you're smaller you might be able to.
B00MHFIABM|3|Loved the make.... But ran way too small!
B00KZ387ZW|5|Very unique and clear detail work. Was giving as a gift and that person was pleased with the item.
B00884QYQO|5|Great fit and slenderizes the waist. The drape is long enough that the front looks like a slender skirt. I am going to order the chocolate pants.
B00WUSXKEI|5|My brother-in-law loved it! Only problem was that I had to order a second one 'cause my sister loved it so much.
B00J04Q7AO|1|The dress looks very long from the picture. I am 5'6, 145lbs. I ordered a large and the bottom hem came up to my shins, it's not long, not even close to the length shown. Definitely returning it
B00K1NML30|5|Very nice clear-looking and elegant tie for my 8 year old. Worth the price. Would by another one with different color tone later.
B001UJ9YES|5|These fit nicely and do the job! Highly recommend.
B00DYRINMI|3|Shirts are good quality but even buying 2 sizes bigger they are still awkwardly short on my average 6 year old. He can still wear them if I hang them to dry but ain't nobody got time for that!!
B0018QAOHY|2|This product is a fine quality but with one fault.  The zipper is too short.  They must be putting zipper for boys pants in men's pants.  What the deal.  I couldn't recommend this to men used to wearing men's pants.  The short zipper is totally unacceptable.
B0045H0L1W|5|I didn't encounter any duds in mine, maybe I'm just lucky. A few were slightly dimmer than normal, but not too noticeable.
B009U2VU58|2|It looks grow eat. Not a whole lot more to expect from appearance...it looks like a santa hat. However, the inside feels cheap. Not sure how long it will last.
B00A0PYFE2|1|Too small
B008LTHRE4|5|I was looking for a light jacket and this one is perfect. It is warm and fits very well. The fabric is great and it is very soft from the inside, it is lined with some type of silky fabric.
B009OKI5OA|5|love it
B0009F9QMO|5|Great alternative to a plain tee shirt!
B001E8LVQ4|3|this is a cute costume, but it arrived without the hooded cape thing.. also, i ordered an xl that is meant for a size 14-16 which i happen to wear.. this costume fits me like a sausage casing, it is so tight..<br />the wig is actually a hair net with two strands of white hair in the front.. just sad.<br />so, i ended up buying an actual white wig and some tulle to make a hooded cape..<br />not recommended for tall girls with meat on their bones..
B005XLUTZ2|5|Fave leggings ever
B00GJF5X4S|3|Good quality, but too large for me.
B00OOMHT9A|5|It's somewhat large, but I ordered a size bigger than my granddaughter, so she has room to grow into it.
B00BP5BUVM|5|Perfect slimming and sexy. !  Im. A petite 118 pounds.  Size. Small is a great fit.  True to size and the fabric is. Silky soft.  Love it
B008ROTJA8|5|These pants are great for our cold norther winter,  Actually I love the white ones the best.  I can wear anything with them and they are made of nice and heavy fleece.  I need this waistband as I have pain there.
B00N73FPYS|1|This sweater arrived from China, stuffed in my mailbox and all squished.  I wear a size 4 and it fits my size.  I'm not impressed with the bat wings, very confining and I hate that the fur is all smushed and matted.. I definitely wouldn't order this from this website again.live and learn
B00AZ2BTXU|5|I love this shirt. Very soft and the fit is outsanding.
B002SB3MHC|4|Worked out really well.  The pants do run large, however when I washed them they worked out just fine.  They came out of the dryer virtually wrinkle free.
B005S6AXRG|4|fine
B00453EQ7Q|5|He was overjoyed with this
B002XULOFU|5|The spankies are just what I was looking for for my daughters. The service was fantastic and super speedy. My daughters love them and the spankies work perfect for dance as well as under their skirts. I will be purchasing here again and I will be telling all my friends.
B00IO649M2|5|These are just right for lounging around the house and sleeping. They are a bit too thin to wear outside (in my opinion) although I have seen teens and adults alike wearing PJ bottoms in the grocery store! These are not see through by any means, just light weight. There is no annoying tag inside, the washing info is printed on the material. This has a very sturdy and tightly sewn  1 1/2&#34;  thick waist band and the legs measure 39&#34; from the top of the waist band, in this medium pant. The hems are also tightly double stitched. These are very good quality, fit well, and are well worth the price. I expect to get another pair soon.
B00DVJQLY6|2|Nicely made and very soft inside. Returned them because I could barely get my hands inside. I ordered the correct size (according to their sizing guide) but they were too small for my hands. I will try again by ordering the next size bigger.
B000MX900G|5|Sports bras for DD+ are a big load of nonsense. This does everything a sports bra is supposed to do but does it better. Get yourself a non-stretch Granny bra, get the right size and you're golden.
B00KSL96QA|4|I read the reviews about it fitting small but I ordered my regular size anyway and it fits great. It definitely lifted my butt and it looks great in jeans. It didn't do anything for my tummy though. I would definitely buy again and recommend to others.
B00D68PXLE|4|My Granddaughter loves it.
B0042X3BH0|5|Exactly what the person was looking for!! This was a gift, but I received feedback.<br />Nice and soft but great cushion, especially for work boots.
B005I477AY|3|The straps run very short so it's a bit uncomfortable especially when reaching up or out.  I kept this one but wouldn't order another one.
B00HB55BVA|2|This is why you should spend 4$ more and buy the one from Jessica Simpson brand that looks exactly the same but fits a lot better!!!<br />I bought this bra in beige color because I was needing some nude color nursing bras. I have a few nursing bras that are pretty with lace and details but the cups are stiff and hard to fold down . Then I purchased the Jessica Simpson clip down nursing bra in black and it is my favorite bra. I will start talking about that one and finish with my opinion of the Motherhood brand.<br />Jessica Simpson clip down nursing bra:<br />It is padded and the padding is loose inside the bra, when you wash it it may fold and you have to reposition but that is the only moment when that is a problem (and is not even that bad, it takes just a few minutes to fix ) .Folding it down for nursing is very easy, the padding is soft and the fabric is too. Also it is easy to clip it with just one hand because there are no silly bows or anything covering the clip . The fabric has a very discreet pattern with small butterflies (really,very discreet )<br /><br />Now the Motherhood clip down nursing bra:<br /> In the picture looks the same and it is indeed very similar , but there are some differences and that is why I am going to exchange mine . The fabric is not as pretty , looks cheaper and has no pattern . the padding is smaller so it looks a little funny not fully covering your bra (you can see that detail in the photos where you clearly can see a circle inside the bra ) . The fabric in the top part of the bra where it clips has a lot of wrinkles, like if the fabric has been stretched or something, so it doesn't look smooth and I don't like that.
B00KRV689Y|5|LOVE THIS TOP..WISH U WOULD SELL MORE LIKE THIS..I WOULD BUY EVERY STYLE AMD COLOR...THANKS!!!!
B0028ZZRFI|5|I have worn the necktie 3 times and it still looks fine, and for $5.00 what a deal. I have ties that cost $85.00 that are no better than this one. I will purchase these cheap ties in the future.
B00MWIFB84|5|I love this,what more can I say
B006D84N9M|3|Nice dress but cheaply made. Was not worth the money for me. I generally wear a 12-14 size in all clothes. The x-large was snug.
B007IVQ698|5|This shirt is sized correctly but they are junior sizes which run about a size or so smaller than a woman's shirt.  Fits well, just what I was looking for.
B00LFQ8I2K|3|Very small, I ordered a size bigger and it still was too small.  Material on bottoms is very thin.
B0064GEHGM|4|The sweater is not as thick as i had hoped, but it is very comfortable, i am wearing it as i write this, and i really enjoy it
B002M0GZHI|5|Exactly what I wanted; the cap made it much easier to put on and wear my Halloween wig.
B00IOE1AOO|5|These mittens are nice and large. My baby has long fingers and other newborn mittens would just come off constantly. These are nice and roomy and stay on great!  I agree that the print is not the best and I wish that they were solid. However, they serve the purpose that I bought them for, and that is to protect my baby's sweet little face.
B00HHUSIDM|5|Just got them and can't wait to jump right in!!!  I love 2xist products and wanted something bold and striking without getting too crazy.  It is awesome that i can find stuff online and not have to run to the store when I need something.  Thank you Amazon!!!
B003IG26IM|1|It fits perfectly but they were dirty ... So disappointing. Come on american apparel... You guys can do better. It's bad enough im paying this price for socks
B00SGA654Q|5|I like the cut of this top; the arm holes don't gape, the buttons don't pull across my size D chest and the length is just skimming the top of my hip (I'm 5'3&#34;) with very nice side slits.  Very comfortable and I love the colors which are well represented by the picture.  The fabric is light but not sheer, perfect for the summer weather.  Shipping was very slow but in this case worth the wait.
B0009MZVU8|5|I've beeb wearing these socks for many years, they are a great product and they never seem to wear out
B00CEH31HG|5|comfortable. i am a size 10 in pants but the size 6 in briefs fit nicely. I will be ordering more soon.
B000LTP27G|2|I once had a pair of these that were white with blue ink.  Unfortunately, these socks are no where near as nice.  The print starts several centimeters from the toe, which makes the heel come up on my Achilles tendon.  There are probably pressure points on the tendon, but I doubt if they're the same as what are on the heels.  Also, they're not very thick and they itch.
B0076TPM10|5|This vest is everything I wanted. Lightweight, warm, not bulky, and the collar zips up to keep the neck warm.
B00BBLA1FG|4|This wig is a great choice if you're on a budget and need something &#34;character-y.&#34; It's not going to look super realistic, but if that's not your goal, it fits the bill for a good price. It's easy to tie a scarf around too to add to the look. The red is a light auburn--more on the orange end of the spectrum. I have an average-sized head and it fit just fine and felt very secure.
B00910V62Q|5|My daughter loves them!!!
B00XMYM1AS|5|great!!!! love this dress
B001R4C99I|5|My Grandson, just loves the softness of the socks.....Thank you and a great price too.....I'll be buying more before the holidays.
B00LAW2Q7C|5|I really like these jeans
B00J7Z0M4I|5|I love these shorts.  They fit perfectly, are comfortable and can be dressed up or down.  I hate that HUE has discontinued them so I am trying to buy as many pairs as possible.
B00NY7ZN0I|5|Cute shirt. Standard quality. Super fast shipping
B00F2V798S|3|The length and size on these leggings is okay, but they are definitely not high waisted,  If you want something that won't ride down, these are not the leggings for you.
B003A7K3QQ|5|Perfect!
B00DRG2STK|5|I previously ordered the aqua version of this top.  These are very light, but not see thru.  A really nice material.  I usually don't like material that is too heavy or too light.  I liked the aqua version so much that I ordered the purplish red version.  They're both very pretty and I've gotten compliments on both on how nice they look on me.  Of course, these won't be appropriate for the upcoming late fall and winter.  The weather's still very warm and these are made of a nice and breezy material, but still weigh enough to hang properly.  Love the colors.  Would recommend.
B00B6ED2ZO|5|After much searching I finally found a good fitting heavyweight T shirt for tall men, at a very reasonable price.  This is not a t-shirt which feels flimsy or will shrink greatly in the dryer.  I got the extra large tall and xx large tall and both fit me very well.  I use the xx large as bed time shirt and x large tall for every day wear.
B00GAS8E2C|5|These jeans not only fit well, but are very comfortable to wear as well.  I have not worn Levi's for some time because other brands have been available in my size at considerably less cost.  It is true that sometimes you have to pay to get the quality you really like.
B0073119IG|5|I thought I was cute in this dress.  I wore it for my son wedding.  The material was great, I loved it.  Highly recommend it, you will not be disappointed.
B00K02HZEW|5|This jumpsuit makes my frumpy body look amazing! The material really stretches and doesn't ride up!
B00JZBX2IC|5|Wonderful suspenders.  I have a rather large belly and my other suspenders are always popping out of the clips but not with these.  I looked everywhere for these.  The price was reasonable and delivery was fast.  Really good service.
B007JX1PFK|5|I really like the skirt. I also bought one for my sister. We are both tall. The length was perfect.
B0006U5BUS|5|Plan to get more of these as they are a must for any T-gals wardrobe!
B00JR2NA68|5|Pretty nice Henley it's a bit tight but I guess it's just supposed to be a slim fit. Definitely will buy from this seller again.
B00FIZYQLQ|5|EXCELENTE
B005LN6P5A|5|This cap is suppose to be tight on your head so it doesn't slip off. I have a big head and this is def one size fits all. Also to those complaining about itch I have long hair and my head is rarely itch while wearing it for 2hrs plus. I paid 37 for it and would def buy another. I love true religion and it's a very good brand.
B0078614Z4|5|This is great it holds up well and looks so cute. I love how many card holders it has. Also it's very thin and can fit in my crammed purse. (Yes!) This is a great buy.
B000HVMIJ8|2|I was really looking forward to these pantyhose. They looked beautiful in the package, they are lovely and very sheer. The lace top with cotton gusset was also great. The problems began when I put them on. I usually wear stockings, so I own hosiery gloves. Because these are pantyhose, for some reason I didn't think to wear the gloves. I definitely should have. They ripped as soon as I stepped into them. When I tried to pull them all the way on, even the lace top of the pantyhose ripped. I don't mean a RUN, they actually ripped! I was pretty disappointed. Not sure if they ripped because of the sheerness, or because I didn't wear hosiery gloves. I'd love to know if anyone else has had a similar experience.
B00TG8JZNU|5|The 3T fit my 3yr old perfectly, but he is very skinny. The shorts are cute and well made. He is happy that they have pockets. I'm happy with the purchase.
B00LEOODG8|5|My new love! Wearing it right now. Love the hood and length. I'm 5'5 and 106 lbs. Ordered a medium to be able to accommodate a sweatshirt or bulky sweater underneath. It is the perfect light jacket option!
B00CIH6C32|4|The top is very beautiful however the shoulder the top ties on kept falling down and showing off the girls. Not cool. I'm hoping the design will be adjust so it doesn't keeping happening.
B002Q812WO|3|The delivery was right on time and was packaged well.  I had to return it because it did not fit properly and was too big.
B00K2VWOPQ|5|Very nice and soft material.
B000WA24DE|5|I LOVED those scarves! They are so pretty! The ones I got were made in Korea, very high quality. Highly recommend this to any music lovers!  I ordered the pink/brown ones and received them in timely manner. Actually I'm coming back to order more, too bad they don't have the same color option anymore.
B007IJ7932|3|Kind of disappointed with the quality of sewing on the borders of this tank, poor workmanship. Fits somwhat large.
B001NEKAWK|4|A comfortable bra with good support & no uncomfortable wires. Straps are a bit wider so they don't cut into your shoulders, especially if you have a larger bust size.
B00SZCDGVA|4|Hey Mikey. he likes them!
B00RD5S8EU|5|It's very very nice coat.
B00777F7FC|5|Love the softness and fit of it
B00QHR7O04|3|this must be made in china sizes are a lot smaller than true size
B004NSUSPM|5|Cute hat! The colors are vibrant and it dries so quickly. Fits true to size.  Definitely worth the money spent.
B00MHVEDC6|5|I ordered too big
B0060FHQI8|5|The dress was to small, but I loved it. Would have reordered a larger size but needed the dress the following weekend! Just not enough time.
B00QII7IX0|5|Soft and true to size. Please be aware that this is not a very thick. Like it very much.
B00HEQX7DK|5|This is perfect for my older sister . She was in need of a hat for the cold weather we had. It's perfect!
B005RRR9WS|4|I had read several reviews and magazine articles about these jeans and I found them to be true.  They are very comfortable, have the stretch to accommodate your shape, and provide a slim fit.  My pair seem to be slightly long, but they look great with heels.  Very nice and I will certainly buy more of this brand.
B004O9KXDW|3|This shirt fit somewhat large, more wide and loose. The length was normal. The color on the words also faded quite a bit after a few washes. I was still pretty happy with it though, it worked for the pictures I wanted it for.
B00916KJGO|4|I absolutely love these shorts, aside from the fact that I need to iron it after wash&dry.<br /><br />I didn't expect these shorts to fit me, and was ready to return it if it did not. Surprisingly, it did fit me! I bought the white with blue stripes version, so it is a bit troublesome if I wore dark underwear (which was expected since it's white).<br /><br />The main problem is that it is not straight after wash&dry. I like the straight look it has in the picture, but was not expecting it to curl. If I knew that this would happen, then maybe I wouldn't have bought it… (a problem for me since I don't have an ironer).<br /><br />No problems, except for the color and the ironing.
B000YYLKHE|5|I was looking sharp with this hat!!
B004U7L84G|1|Didn't look like picture at all. It looked cheaply made. Returned it.
B00YH8LOGA|4|Nice, pretty scarf as pictured, material is just a little flimsy.
B002A219FQ|5|I was worried this wouldn't be as absorbent as the terrycloth robes I've always purchase in the past.  I was wrong: it's just as, or even better than terrycloth.  Plus, it's lighter and silkier too ... so a great robe all around!
B003XC5NEU|1|38&#34; was more like 35&#34; and my wife had to buy extenders so they would fit
B00AXIRT0I|5|Very Nice & Fast Delivery
B0083EZF0U|5|Great t shirt. Proud to wear it!  Fits like it's supposed to.  I've as lead had compliments wearing it the first day!
B000VVXNWA|4|Used for an up north weekend trip. Stayed warm, sucked moisture away from the skin. Definitely not anti-microbial but overall it seemed to do the job.
B0029XFJSE|1|I guess their sizes run small, but when I took them out the packaging they looked about 2 sizes smaller than my normal size so they didn't fit :P
B00CP96D6E|1|These DO NOT fit true to size!!!!! They look baggy and loose. You're NOT going to get the fitted look like their model unless you possibly buy a size smaller. You won't know that until you spend extra money on shipping sending the back and forth. And Nastypig themselves are not understanding, concerning or helpful with this issue!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS BRAND !!!!!!!!
B00GGJT8IY|4|Looks good, caught attention by the design, the fabric is the typical Neff heavy cotton, regular fit. It's alright, not going crazy about it.
B00ASQFW8Q|5|This dress is very sparkly and elegant. It definitely lets u be sexy but classy at the same time. The sheer sleeves are very soft material. I got it in black and it super sparkly and soft material! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a different little black dress.
B0077KKEBG|1|I bought it and when it delivered, i didnt check inside. It looks great outside. I sent it to my friend in vietnam. When she opened it, its cracked inside the wallet, and she can not use it... It makes me very embarrassed....
B00NF3Y4OM|4|I love the design of this shirt and despite it being rather tight bought a second for myself and one for my son who looks great in it as he has a fine physique and loves very tight tops.  For me I like them a little on the loose side and wish that they were available in 1 or 2 sizes larger.
B00F5ZBZNQ|2|Here's the deal: the image is wonderful and I did expect the product would be the same. However, its definitely not. Its overpriced (for one) the lace sticks to the underskirt causing electric effect and it is not as short as the picture (it covers my knees).
B0069U5KGO|5|This is a fun tie that is perfect for fall or neutral looks, but still has some extra flair to it.  A good quality feel and look.
B00MJAWU8E|3|True to size. Made me look amazing!!! But...<br />I really fell in love with this product but why must it be so uncomfortable! Every time I sit down the wires completely digs into my stomach by the bellybutton area. I feel like I can't breath it's horrible! Even worse it takes whatever outside clothing I have in with it!
B00EK5RNT2|4|Definitely Asian size!! I ordered a medium for my size 2-4 granddaughter and it was too tight on the thighs.  She is a swimmer and not overweight!<br />  But it is cute and I am going to reorder in a larger size.
B00AX89M3K|5|I love this  black skirt. It fits perfectly and is very complimentary to one's silhouette. I highly recommend this skirt!
B002QB0V28|4|It is indeed slim fit, in US standard anyway. The chest and waist are not so baggy. Fits as it says. But I have to move the buttons at sleeve to make it fits better.
B00KSVIT54|1|Ridiculous advertising explain to buyers how sizes run bought  lsize L but fts size xs and iam pettite
B00D0WH6SY|5|My size is actually Small; but because this size was not available in Black, I decided to take a chance.  With the tie at the back, I am happy to report that it looks great - not too big at all.
B00JQVURQ6|5|This is one of the most BEAUTIFUL dress I have seen .And Ms.Cat was my first &best experience I've had ,she made sure that I have Received  it in time .Ms.Cat  went over and beyond the call of duty  !!!!!THANK YOU  MS. CAT
B00AOCX43Y|4|The inside is a little scratchy and stayed that way for about 6 washes
B00M0ZJOB4|5|Highly recommended
B004QF0TFQ|4|So far so good. Order 2 packs of 6
B000SKI752|5|Great fit
B00N5TIMXA|1|This dress looks like it would fit an eight year old. No use for me threw away
B0039SFKAU|5|I love these and will never buy another brand.            Sara B. in NC
B00E661GG6|5|This is tie is fantastic for the price. I was actually surprised by how good the quality was. I'd recommend.
B00F77NVAM|5|We bought this for our little one, she's bigger then most kids her age and it fit wonderfully. The color is accurate and it arrived promptly.
B00ARRA1XW|4|I love this hoodie, it's very stylish and just what I needed.  It does seem to run a little small and next time I may order an extra large.
B00URJIHUE|3|Made in China. Shipped from China.
B00IJ73H8S|4|This backpack is adorable but does not appear heavy duty enough to last through months of use for school.  I do not expect it to last more than a few months because the material is very thin.
B00HMHKS38|5|Nice loose fit. I need the extra sleeve length.
B00GXWTEP6|3|The sleeves are 3/4 length.  Was looking for a full length sleeve so that is why I said too small.  The robe itself fits fine and is nice and thick.  Not high quality terry cloth but it is nice.
B00IT38N18|5|I bought these shorts in the green color in the XXL size. They fit perfectly everywhere and have a great stretch, but one that won't leave you tugging at them all day long. I'm 5'5 and they hit right in the middle of my thigh, as the picture shows. These are great shorts and definitely worth the money!
B00BMJ0WKG|4|Since I was a teen I have always carried the &#34;French clutch&#34; style wallet. I decided to try a different style and I am so glad I did. I can get every thing I need in this wallet. I don't even need a coin purse because of this style. It comes with a leather clean cloth and a storage bag. This is a very nice quality wallet.
B00GPTRNS2|4|I'm 5'9&#34; and 116 lbs, and these socks fit well over my knees, but not past mid-thigh. They fit tight on my thighs, but it's nothing a little wearing can't fix. The colors are great, and fit comfortably into normal shoes.
B00IKUTITG|3|As title states, arrived with gaping hole in the seam of the legs.  I had picked these up for something cheap and quick to use for a short period of time, did not expect to have to make repairs on it so soon.  Was able to sew it together and use it that night for work, but I will upgrade to a different set as soon as I am able
B005N8W4JY|5|these are awesome.  They keep my hands and wrists warm while I am working on the computer.  They also are nice under gloves/mittens!
B00UJWQE72|5|If there was a way to post a pic, I would!!! love these jeans!!!
B00BTO3JHW|5|I like the fabric of the Shirt and it came in a Timely Manner. The shirt fits as expected.
B002ETVLZ8|5|Fits well, heavy enough and not too heavy to travel with in a purse.  This was a good buy.  Looks like it will last a long time which I wanted, too.
B00I90NTEC|5|I just received this dress it us absolutely  beautiful it is a little big for me should have ordered a xs but thats ok being that I know how to sew..I was worried about the length because I'm so short but it was perfect with wedges I will be wearing. Would recommend this dress, I'm sure it fits true to size but I  keep loosing weight..I better start eating more..thanks
B003MX4ULC|5|I love the shirt.  It is a bit snug so I should have give with a large.  I will order some large to see the difference.
B006L3V608|3|I loved the fact that they are unseen.  However the elastic is very irritable for all day wear.  I left a dent in my heels.
B006LPHJ7U|5|My Grandson lost his wallet so this is his replacement
B00H5AD4JC|3|Not bad but it was a little tight around my legs but it does make my booty look good.
B00OCGPJ1I|5|Very good
B005BKO7B2|4|Product arrived on time, but with no shipping notification or tracking.  It is an odd fit, narrow with lots of extra room front and back, but not bad for a novelty item.
B00C0PIREE|5|This bikini was a little large for a small. I wish it came in extra small but other then that it fits me rather well I am 5' 3' and a C cup. The fringes are beautiful and the bottom is modest so nothing is too revealed. I would recommend this bikini for woman who want to look SEXY AND CLASSY!
B009HXD3E6|5|A fabulous tie! About these Lorenzo Cana ties in general: they tend to have some iridescent threads in some parts of the pattern which is difficult to portray in a photograph. The &#34;orange&#34; color some folks see is actually a bright bronze that will brighten to a &#34;yellow&#34; as the light changes across the tie. The other colors of this tie do not do this. Overall, this is a slightly less bold looking tie than you may expect from the photograph, but bold enough to 'pop' if that is what you are looking for.<br /><br />See review for Lorenzo Cana tie #36025
B009EB8XX2|5|This outfit is cute and fits my daughter well.  She is a skinny, tall girl so it is a little loose in the middle on her, but it would probably fit other babies just right.<br /><br />The sparkly heart looks great, and it is printed on so the glitter isn't falling off everywhere.  That's definitely nice.<br /><br />Also, the pants have ruffles on the bum, so it's a pretty girly outfit.<br /><br />We have the 9 month size and it has long sleeves, which is just perfect, because we got this for February (Valentine's day season) and it's winter.<br /><br />If you're considering this outfit, I recommend it.
B0062HMUFI|4|I think this pair of pj's are particularly comfy and give you that 'little kid feeling' when you wear them to bed. They were a nice price too since they came with both the top and bottom, so that's cool. The only reason I didn't give the set five stars was because (like practically every single pair of pajamas I own), they shrunk from multiple runs in in the dryer. This always happens. I should probably just hang these kinds of things up to dry, but then they aren't soft. So, I just wear them like they are. The pants fit around the waist and all, but they are kinda short now. I probably look like I'm ready for a flood when I wear them :) And the shirt is a little smaller too, but the material is pretty stretchy so it hasn't been a problem yet. Anyways, I've had them over a year now and still wear them, so I guess that right there tells you that they are just fine.
B00BIFJ3U4|5|Fits as expected.  Gives great form.  Smooth under tops.  Love this bra.
B00VRNR9VM|3|I am usually size small or medium for tops and ordered large, which is quite tight.  I think this top is supposed to fit tight.  I'm only 5'2&#34; and bust 36B.  It's completely see-through the entire backside so definitely need tank top under.  Very concerned about it holding up with washing and huge potential for snagging on everything.  Since price is so low, may just keep it because it is so lovely and had a great neckline.
B006KXVKIW|5|Love these. They make diaper changes so easy:)
B0066LC7B2|5|Very nice.  Used for a Mardi Gras Party at an Assisted Living Facility.  Much better than the 30 inch necklaces.
B001D4HJRY|5|They are what you would expect, these are cool and a great way to customize youself.
B00L8SPQ7A|1|don't buy these, terrible smell !!!!!!, very high rise (the picture shows low rise) and they came defective....will never buy again....
B0032Z7TL8|5|I really fell in love with this dress when I first saw it. Read the reviews and was concerned about the comments saying the dress ran small, so I got the 18 mo. size for my one year old and it did run a bit small. The width around the torso fit her perfectly, but length was definitely for a 18 month old, but I loved the dress regardless. She was so cute in it, definitely a dress for celebrating in.
B00BNIBCQ4|5|Love it
B009VE4ZZW|5|It's super cute and it is warm too! I really like it. Enough room for big hair and hair styles
B00IEEQLCA|5|My calves are much larger than my ankles, so I've been dealing with socks falling down my whole life. Every once in a while I find long socks that go over my calves, but after a few months of washing, even those shrink just enough to start falling down. I'm 5'8&#34;. These socks pull all the way up to my knee easily and could go a little higher if I stretched them, so I don't expect them to ever shrink enough to drop too low. I'd like to see more patterns designed for men, but I wouldn't really classify that as a complaint.
B00J3TGW6A|4|These pants are a one size fits all so they seem just a little big on the waistline(I'm 5'5&#34;, 125lbs)but it is what I expected based on the measurements posted. The print of the trim is different than in the picture(mine was all red, no pink). But I think it probably varies. The material looks like it would be see-thru, but when you put them on you cannot(even with white undies). Material is a little itchy but I haven't washed them yet. Over all I really like them. They were MUCH cheaper than my $70 Buddha pants!
B00IUGKIYY|5|I buy an XL and I'm a C/D cup and the top is a little small but they can be acomodated fine! The buttom fits fine.
B000MUFVAW|5|Looks great and wears well. My two year old gets around and this outfit is standing up to the job!
B00ACIH7UG|5|My husband loves them. Great fit and very comfortable.
B00CI1HWMI|5|Light in weight, puffy and very comfortable to wear under your puffy maxi evening gowns, I recommend it for girls and ladies too.
B00MH9QK10|3|Weird fit but not too bad
B00420TMVC|4|Bought these for my wife after she expressed interest. I was suprised at how much she liked them. She said the warmth without restricting her hands was great since she types a lot with her work. She's worn them almost every day until it warmed up. I will be buying other colors for her.
B000V0EPTQ|2|I wanted to pay less than what I usually pay when I purchase scrubs. These were okay for about 2 months and then holes started appearing in the knees. They do not last with moderate use. The color was nice though.
B00IR8VKNI|4|Comfortable but not as comfortable as other underwear of the same brand.
B004WJ8MDC|1|Way to big, had to hot glue it together to use it for my costume. Didn't have time for an exchange
B004Y7AV3G|4|These are great gloves. The white stays on just fine. The only reason i gave 4 stars was because the white bone part doesent go all the way up the arm as shown. Only about half of that. But still a GREAT product ! And totally worth buying
B003Z6PE20|1|I guess the outside pocket is for coins because it's too short to hold cards (credit card size).  It and most, if not all, of the pockets (four inside, one \\"behind and inside\\", and the one on the outside) are narrower than they appear either because of stitching or adhesive (?).  The money clip is tucked inside the wallet too far.  Money sticks out the side (not the end) of the wallet by a little bit.  You have to open up the wallet if asked to remove your I.D. from the transparent viewing window.  My ID window came with adhesive (sticky goop) along one edge of it.  When trying to rub off the goop, I scratched/marred the plastic surface.  I was excited at the possibility of replacing a very old wallet of similar design.  This is not the solution for me...disappointing.
B00AK3454Y|5|Great for all my toddler's summer outfits!  Pink and gray go with most of her shirts.  She loves wearing these under dresses, too!
B005GYGG6W|5|The pants are super comfortable and are long enough for even me at 5'9!  I love them!  I can wear them on a workout walk or just lounging around the house.  I've even worn them to the grocery store!  :)
B00YE1ROBO|5|i liked this outfit cause it came with a jacket and you cant find it like that in stores here, very fast shipping very soft material and i liked the jacket was a little bigger then the pants.. the pants fitted perfect very colorful as well
B00CPRP51U|5|A very well made kilt all round. Great pockets, fabric, stitching and design. Will have lot's of wear as a causal kilt for party's, festivals and general outdoor activity. Would recommend to any guy who likes the FREEDOM of a kilt.<br /><br />Many thanks
B00O7MRQFE|5|This bra is just as great as the name brand sports bra at less than half the price.  The material is a little thinner than Moving Comfort but for the money, I wouldn't trade it.  Fits snug but not binding or constrict the chest.
B000H70KQA|5|I love this jacket. I get lot of compliments from my friends. You will look fashionable and slim.
B004ARZKJA|5|My husband enjoys having his hankie with him in his pocket daily. It has come in handy on many occasions. They are as expected. Nice cotton with a classic unobtrusive design. I put them in the washing machine and fold them when they finish the dryer. They have some wrinkles and curling up in the corners but I don't bother to iron them. This is my second time ordering them and since the last order was 6 years ago, I decided to get some new fresh ones.
B00NB8VMP0|5|Quite thin, but good for just a chill and not for cold weather.  It's a nice sweater.
B007BLNK6W|4|Right,but Fabric is thin
B005HJ7FVQ|5|ok
B002WB0V54|1|Let me say first, I love Timberland shoes and I bought Tshirts in the past, all great quality. But I recently bought 3 Timberland Tshirts directly from their site and I have to say I am totally disgusted what they sell for a premium price. Cheap, thin, flimsy shirts with poor quality print and they don't fit at all. A previous post says their XL is way too big, my XL shirts are way to small. There doesn't seem to be a standard no more. And the fabric is from the poorest quality I have ever seen. You normally find this quality only in those $3 shirts in tourist shops. But not when you pay almost $30 for a shirt from a company that is known for quality.  I have no idea what has gotten into Timberland, but this is NOT!!! what I expected from them. I can only warn everyone: Do NOT buy their Tshirts online. Go to a store and check them out first, at least you know what quality you are paying for. No wonder they offer FREE RETURNS, I guess there are just too many.
B000XTHOA2|5|thank you
B0050VXYUC|1|So small you can barely make out what it is, forget being about to read the words on this button. It's even smaller than the image provided.
B00IGJFNIQ|5|These are beautiful socks that look great and feel great. They are not thin and chintzy they are not heavy and too thick - they are just right and look like expensive socks. Granddaughter is going to love them.
B001RZF6L0|5|Our baby boy has been using this suitt since he is about 7 months out in the boat, beach, pool etc... people always make good comments about his little surfer look. it protects him from the sun and rough surfaces. And he will wear it for  looooong time.. (their smallest size is 2T) It has been so popular that it has become one of our favorite gifts to give to all of our little boaters/water friendly new born friends together with a very cute swim short.  Every time he wears it he makes a fashion statement and all the moms asks where to buy it.  It has been difficult to find for the second time so do not hesitate. The only bad side is when the baby is very young and you have to change diapers often.. but that goes away fast you know it!.. Love to all of you
B00BPFJV7W|4|Love the dress!! Read the reviews after i purchased it so i was a little nervous. But it's exactly what i expected. Definitely a dress for curvy women. One review said it was like a big t-shirt. Definitely not on me. Hugged me in all the right places!<br /><br />-Alicia J
B003EN2FA8|5|Great scarf and great price too!
B00IXWZA2K|5|This dress was a gift to my daughter. she loved it so much. it fits as expected and will not hesitate to purchase the same dress with different color
B0033PRG9W|5|I bought this on a trip to Napa Valley and found it to be light-weight and it allowed a breeze to cool me. This hat will crush and still look good to wear. My mom wants one now too.
B003MQ9NBG|4|Lovely, fine knit sock of good quality.  They will not bind your feet or ankles if you have swelling.
B00O0P4E1M|5|As expected.
B0052GL79K|4|This product is amazing! You have 4 places you can adjust to make this the perfect fit for anyone!<br />I'm a big girl and this looks amazing on me. Good quality product too, tightened it as tight as I could and it was pulled but still holding! It looks lovely and holds up nicely. Worth every penny.
B000N28Y4E|5|I was certainly impressed with the quality of this Tshirt. The fabric is comfortable and it is NOT just an iron on decal. I ordered my son an YXL since he is almost 10yrs. old. It is perfect for the fact that it will fit him for the next year too!
B00EP9CJRY|5|Bought this item for my 8 month old grand-daughter.  Fits her perfectly and is adorable on her.
B0030DF8DS|5|These pants were exactly as I expected.  The price was a little higher than I wanted but I am happy with the product and shipping speed.
B00K2V1H1I|5|Beautiful outfit
B0018R5BS0|5|I just wanted a pair of basic durable jeans - not ones that were already ripped or had fancy stitching on the pockets or were so low on the waist that they showed - well, you know - when I bent over. I was getting a bit disgusted with other brands as they seemed not to be made very well and sometimes the fabric lost its shape after just one wash - never to fit right again even though I'm a fairly small person. I had not had a pair of Levi's in many years.  They are comfy, look pretty durable and they fit pretty well. They look stylish, but I feel I can wear them cleaning house or working on other projects without worrying that they will fall apart. I purchased a pair of 515s at the same time, but in a different fabric. I could say pretty much the same thing about them. Can't decide which pair I like best, but I've come back to Levi's.
B00KJBL504|5|Fits perfectly, I love it.
B00E3NIKWU|4|I like this hat alot of people liked it but it says made in china real true religion says made in usa but nobody gonna look at that good hat still came in 4 days very comfortable and good looking
B0002JTUVO|5|What can I say, I love U.S. camo, I always have. I have been searching for loose fitting cargo pants for a while now and I am especially fond of American camouflage, I'm British you see and I find the U.S. stuff so much more cooler. I love to wear my cargo pants baggy and these are baggy enough for my taste, they feel and look of good construction, fit exactly how I want them to (as I mentioned earlier) and look fantastic! I would certainly recommend these to anyone that is looking for very loose fitting cargo pants. I purchased them in a size medium, my waist is roughly 32 inches, I'm approximately 6 feet tall and they fitted me in a loose/baggy style to which I am accustomed to. Excellent item and service.
B00QNT3OHS|5|I love the style of the corset. I work as a &#34;pirate&#34; and it looks great with my costume. It holds up really well daily and for 11 hrs at a time. My only complaint is I wish I had not ordered as large as I did. I am 5'5 and about 145 lbs. My waist is a tad narrow for my size though. According to the sizing chart, and following other people's advice, I ended up ordering a 2xl. It is too large for me. I have the bottom laces tightened as tight as they will go and it is still too big. I wish I would have ordered an xl instead. It isn't bad though, and is rather comfy. Instead of 2 sizes larger, Id say only order one size larger than what the sizing guide says to order. I believe according to the sizing guide I needed a large. I ordered 2 sizes up as most suggested. Maybe if you're a bit thicker in the middle (like apple shape)  you should go 2 sizes up. But id say I'm average thick to narrow in the middle for my height and weight (id say im more banana or hourglass shaped). So if you're built like me, order only one size up from the guide. But overall, a beautiful and comfy corset! I would order again, and I definitely recommend it!
B00AKB3VPA|5|I went on a trip and forgot to pack a dress for an outdoor party. I sort of had a Lilly Pulitzer tunic dress look in mind, but did not want to spend as much as was being asked for those dresses. Went on amazon and ordered this dress and had it shipped overnight to the resort. It arrived early the next day! I am 5'4&#34; and 135#, but ordered the 4 based on other reviews that said to order a size down. It fit perfectly. I was a little worried that the bold print might be a bit much for me based on my physique, but the pattern and cut combine in a very flattering way. The material is a somewhat heavy polyester, which will be perfect for me if there is a breeze. It fell out of the package with zero wrinkles and I know it will travel well! My only complaint is that the button flaps on the sleeves hang down below the edge of the sleeve when they are undone, so you basically HAVE to keep them fastened. Too bad because the sleeves look rather pretty down. I have not purchased anything from Donna Morgan before, but I would buy again based on this pretty dress.
B00DUWLI6A|5|Work so well!!
B00PECLSIW|5|Its amazing
B00C5KNTD8|5|As I have gotten older, the search for a pair of jeans that fits right has become harder and harder.  33&#34; inseams are too long, 31&#34; are too short, some waists are too high, others are too low.  I feel like Goldilocks - these are &#34;just right&#34;!  Be sure to order a size down from what you normally wear, as other reviewers have said.  I normally wear a 16 or 16W in most jeans, and I ordered these in a 14.  They are snug, but in a good way, and they hold their shape all day.  The banded waist falls just below my navel, right where it should, so you don't get the &#34;curl over&#34; with a waist that's too high.  The length is great, I can wear it with flats or heels.The leg opening is just right too - not slim, not boot cut - so it gives your leg a great silouhette.  I can't wait to try Jag's shorts and capris. My only complaint is I would love to find these in more colors.  Bring them on!
B001BZABMU|5|fit as I expected, washed great, didn't shrink when I dried it. great shirt!!
B0031227Q4|4|And, really, you do not need to know why I chose trunks over briefs.
B00757DVSE|5|I bought this shirt because it is  one of the cheaper ones on Amazon. I didn't really have high hopes but I love DC Superhero shirts. When the shirt arrived I fell in love with it. The material is kind of thin, but I didn't need to wear something underneath (I like the thinner material). It was very soft and it looked amazing on me. I usually wear a large, but the Extra-large fit like a large, so it runs a bit small.
B00FN4CM36|5|i didnt know that the dress would come pass my knees, looking at the picture I should have known. I ordered my correct size. It fits well and it's beautiful. Looks just like the picture. I have no complaints over here. I will be ordering from this company again.
B00B9BPUAE|5|Bought this for my daughter's third birthday party.  Fit great - she is a bit tall for a just turning 3 year old girl but we had no issues.  The tutu is unlined and a bit itchy so we ended up not wearing that part but I'm sure it will get used for dress up at some point!
B003IC7V9U|4|Shirt runs small just like other reviews state, but very cute! Package includes, Shirt, Hat and glasses only, must order the socks separate.
B00W6FMAT6|1|The quality of dress is really bad...don't buy it
B00C2RSLUA|3|This costume is discontinued, last season.  It was for my son and my brother had the same one.  Both complained that they couldn't see when wearing the full costume so my son altered it by stopping at the neck line.  We still had a good time, Trick or treat!
B00AXV91DS|3|Its okay. Not all what i expected. Also a real strong chemical/warehouse smell.
B00COBQAK2|2|The fit was too small.
B0084DGK1S|5|When I bought these jeans my daughter was just starting to fit into some of her 18 month clothes and I read that they fit a little large. Well they weren't kidding! These jeans showed up and I had to pull the elastic adjuster in big time. I also had to roll up the pant legs. But that's okay, because they still look good on her! I love that they are also made of a true denim fabric so they don't pill and wear out in the washing machine. These are jeans that will survive a toddler!!
B004IOXHSG|4|The fleece lining these tights is very soft and comfortable and kept me relatively warm by themselves, though I definitely felt it when the wind started blowing. These tights fit well too: I didn't have to struggle beyond normal to put them on, and while they did begin to sag around my ankles after a full day of wear, it didn't affect the fit anywhere else and it was easily adjusted.<br /><br />The main drawback to these tights was the smell: within a couple minutes of putting them on, I became aware of a very strong plastic/nylon smell wafting up from my legs. Even after a full day of wearing them outside in a breeze, on the train, in the library, on a bus, and around the house, the smell stayed strong, rubbed off onto my hands, and clung to my legs when I took off the tights.<br /><br />In short, these were definitely a good buy and I would buy them again, but I'd wash them before wearing them.
B00DNVGJIA|3|Once I was done &#34;fixing&#34; the mask, it was great. The gem at the top of the mask had fallen off when the mask arrived in mail. I used some craft glue to re-attach it. I also touched up the glitter to fill in some of the empty spaces on the design. It seems like it was put together in a rush so the craftsmanship wasn't to my satisfaction. I do appreciate receiving my order very quickly.
B00GXN69PS|5|My little 4-year old girl loves this and wears it wherever she can!!!  As anyone with a little girl knows, you just HAVE to be a princess and Disney lover when you're a little girl!!!
B0083F6XH8|4|A little smaller then expected. Get size up for better fit
B00A7QU8WM|3|Its exactly what you expect.<br />Undershirt, light and thin.<br />Didnt like it too much compared to black
B00LZDDY3G|5|Good fit
B00LU59S84|4|It's a t-shirt... It was isometric and everything!
B00AJ32SDU|2|It's a great sweater but the zipper broke around 1 month of purchase. Too bad, because I only wore it a couple times and I can't refund it anymore.
B002LHLU1I|5|I have purchased this hat in several colors.  The hats are very comfortable and the fit can easily be adjusted.
B00CTYSN5Y|4|I would likd toThank you very much and I hope to deal with you again.<br />Best wishes for you :)
B007F52GOQ|5|great socks
B003OCPHWM|3|We got the bunny pattern and it's adorable and the fabric is super soft.  My son is long and skinny and the 3-6 month size fit him fine at 4 months.  I haven't tried since then though because one of the snaps broke after its 3rd wearing - the ankle snap stayed snapped and pulled out of the fabric when trying to take it off him for a diaper change.  For the price, I'd hope for higher quality.
B00PMVBWLS|5|Gorgeous
B006U1EM66|5|Just what I needed for this really cold weather.  Looks good - feels good - works like a champ!
B00H1BRL6M|5|I originally didn't want to buy this product since my bf said that he didn't want it, but it was shipped by accident due to the holidays. I asked him to try it on but he loved it!
B00WTGTZLS|5|Great shirt! Great quality!
B00JBHZ7AQ|5|Love the fit, I wear the xs and it wasnt too roomy like other scrub tops.
B00CXLBA2G|5|I recently bought this skirt in grey and I love it SO much that I am buying it in the other colors. I have longer legs than the average woman so I have a hard time finding a maxi that is long enough for me. This is perfect in length and it isn't sheer! You can't see through the skirt at all and it is SO comfortable! I recommend this skirt to every woman that likes a long skirt.
B00K9YWR6M|5|A really cute outfit that's perfect for formal and casual events. I can rock this outfit in any situation. Loving it!
B00F1X6BLS|4|Comfy and easy to wear around the house, ok for an outfit if layered
B00BTNP8RW|1|This shrunk after the first wash. I'm talking shrunk from an XL Men's shirt to a half shirt. A girl's half shirt.
B00I3T7756|4|I absolutely loved the shirt when I got it. Fit great, very cute. Over time it was worn funny, shrinking unevenly but i did get a good 6 months of almost weekly wear out of it.
B004QKJ7M2|5|It is exactly what I wanted. Even after a couple of washes I didnt see any shrinkage so as long as you order to size you should be golden. I havent had it long enough to comment on if the color will peel off but it seems to be of a durable type. It looks fantastic, and I got compliments when I wore it. I really love the arm stripes, they add something to it that other shirts dont. The fabric is not thin and see through which I also appreciated.  Update: roughly 3 years later and its still great. =D
B008LOYXJ6|2|I'm a 34B. I typically wear smalls in clothing, but mediums in sports bras. I purchased the medium in this one and it is snug, to say the least. It's a bit like having a compression bandage wrapped around my chest. I may take the padding out and see if that helps; however, I did buy it because of the padding [and the positive reviews]. It's not nearly as soft and comfortable as I had hoped and expected it would be. I would not purchase this product again.
B000HNHIHS|4|I like the shirt, great material.  It will be fun wearing it!!
B008LWQCX8|5|Strong, soft and superbly sewn denim shorts fit mid thigh - good length as I was looking for something different than bermuda shorts. I'm 5' 2&#34; and I weigh 280 lbs and the size 18 fits me perfectly. Definitely a good buy.
B00B4DCQ86|5|I had purchased the bra which turned out not to be a good fit. Not full enough on top to fill the cup even though it's a soft cup without underwire or padding. So when I saw the matching underwear at such a good price I thought finally a matching set. Well I returned the bra and kept the underwear. I find Hanro sizes tend to larger, but the underwear are a perfect fit for me. They actually cover my butt.
B0018SNASM|4|Thank you, Jantzen, for making swimwear for slightly older (52), but not over the hill women. Flattering style. The bottoms cover my bottom well and comfortably. The top covers my middle. Only negative is that it is a little plunging, but not indecent. I have a pool and I frequent the beach. I would wear it in public proudly!
B00CBAOAHG|5|Warm and comfortable. Works great by itself or as an undershirt. The sleeves will easily stretch out if you want to roll them up, but washing it brings them to their regular size.
B006PHXUOU|3|Good size, and protects well my credit cards and ID, after 1 week of use, the lock system broke and I wasn't able to close it properly, so I had to throw it away.
B00JTPKM8M|5|The recipient loves it!
B00S8YF62M|3|It was not as wide as it seemed. It's cute though
B008F2HFJY|4|Savane has designed the perfect pants for changing waistlines around the holidays.  The pants are quite comfortable.  Nice fabric.  Definitely worth the money.
B00O1PCVUM|5|ADORABLE! Thick and warm.
B00BF9ZH80|2|I ordered a size 34. The shorts that arrived were marked 34 but were built more like a size 38 or 40!  They would literally just fall off me. Promptly returned.<br /><br />Too bad, because the style was rather nice.  The material was very, very thin, but that can be good in a short.
B000VK5QZS|5|This is my first time shopping on line for bra. I must say it is a perfect fit and excellent support, no need for under-wire. Very comfortable and soft fabric in cups and wide straps.  I highly recommend for Full-Figure women. Thanks Amazon.  J.B.
B001LJUBZS|5|Glad to know they still make this style billfold.  In all the stores I went to all the brands had just one style.  I have used this type for many years.  Keep up the good work Rolf!
B00HR4UCY6|5|Perfect size to hold cellphone, cards, keys and other miscellaneous items. Wrist bangle helps to hold the purse more securely. The material it is made from is more than worth the price.
B000QFGNOQ|5|great for the Dora fan.  My granddaughter greatly enjoys this nightgown.  Good quality and has upheld well under several washings.  Shipped promptly.
B0055YZGIM|1|not a good purchase size deceiving
B00KLJN26Y|5|This shirt is so comfy, and I have gotten lots of compliments on it.  I think it fits more &#34;fitted&#34; than &#34;flowy&#34;, and that's what I was looking for but I think that description is inaccurate.  I ordered a size larger than I normally would have due to other reviews, and that was probably a good move, however, I think had I ordered my regular size, it wouldn't have been too small.
B000GZBJ04|5|Received when expected and fits very well. Would recommend this cap.
B00KFPICNC|5|Good quality patch with Velcro
B00MZ87CHO|4|Really like the color and fit of this shirt.  Perfect with a black tank underneath.
B000XGNQ48|5|I wore this to my daughter's wedding and had it on for over 8 hours.  It was so comfortable, I forgot it was on my head!
B00IXYY6ZU|2|I ordered this item because I was looking for  a women plus size  It fitted like plus size for a Junior size  This is not a women plus size
B00O2PZ2G6|2|The legs were super short, and a hole was torn in the crotch almost instantly. But the color is good. only buy if you have short, stubby legs and the most dainty, patient fingers for pulling them on/off.
B000CDLECS|1|Does not deserve the 4 or 5 star rating it got.  It did not fit my husband's head, is unrealistically white, and is not full (looks cheap.)
B001D3RQ7S|1|This item was worthless.Ripped the very first time I tried to use it. Even if it had not ripped, it was poorly designed and was not the color of any skin I have ever seen. Don't waste your money !!!
B00F6Z7G5G|3|Looks good but too snug.  I'd buy a size or two up next time.
B00N3UXS2G|4|Very comfortable.  I feel secure in this top, and it has great options like no straps where the drawstring-type back allows for a good fit still, or criss cross straps.  It's too bad the larger size is only C/D and not separately C or D.  The cups &#34;don't&#34; dump, but instead curve all around, so it works just fine - I probably would be a C is it were available. Quality material and very cute patter/design.  Colors look good on my fair skin.  I've lived in this suit all summer and love it.
B0007QMKN2|1|Way too tight!
B000MXLYZU|3|I ordered the same exact size as the Khaki's but the black ones are a little too snug. Same pants, same style, different color. Maybe that's why dark clothes make you look slimmer!
B000UA2LHU|5|Good, simple belt.<br /><br />Not much else I can add, though. Just trying to get to the word count.
B00FCEF00O|3|This dress fits smaller than I expected.  If you have a large bust, particularly 'D' cups, order one size up.  This fits tight across my chest.  Otherwise, the print is lovely.  The material is a thin polyester jersey.
B00J3PNT2O|4|Received in a timely fashion but seems big for a size small. Fits baggy
B00DB8DWY4|5|This veul is beautiful. I cant wait to wear it. It is exactly how it shoes in the pics,
B0091T4DIQ|3|it's like any bottom.  Doesn't make you look super great or bad either.  The cut on the backside is a little boxy and can make your butt look that way.
B00OWD5218|5|Perfect on my hubby
B00B6EA6UI|5|I was looking for a well made women's flannel shirt in a nice color.  This is it.  I'm a size 8, ordered the XL, and yes it's quite big on me.  It drives my fashionable daughters crazy. But,  I like my shirts big.  It's a good size to wear as a shirt jacket.  It arrived quickly and was packaged well.  Thank you for a quality product.
B0043OA13A|4|Came as described, though there are loose ends.  The sewing looks a little rushed.  Threads are lose and not cut.
B003UBDQRK|5|Very nice, 100% cotton.
B00RNCESXI|5|Excellent. Beautiful.
B000GF5EN2|5|Actually fits my head, nice, printed on both sides.
B00M0CN4RC|3|Cardigan is very nice only gave 3 stars because it wasn't actually black
B00AXYFCI8|5|It's cute and warm.  I like the thickness.  It also isn't itchy like other hats of a similar style.  Love it!
B00GSNXPMS|4|I found these to fit very comfortably for a thong and at a great price too. So I purchased two, the purple and red ones. It doesn't feel like it's riding up the rear and I actually feel like I have nothing on. I'd recommend these.
B00KRYLKH6|3|It's an OK under shirt probably not fit for wearing as a T shirt to go out.
B0083N031W|5|It fits perfectly. My wife said, &#34; I could make you one!&#34; I said,&#34;Okay, but I don't need a green or black one. I already have !&#34;.Whether your wife can knit,or not, a Kufi shows solidarity and unity for us Muslims. I'm Caucasian  but I'm-in-your-face-with it, and so should we all be. proud and humble as well under Allah.
B00HRNU8QE|1|The buttons are very loose. And it took 2 months for me to get it... There wasn't any  tracking.. I wouldn't order from them again
B00IUTB00M|2|When I received the costume the head piece was broken. Luckily I purchased something else along with the outfit to use for the viking helmet. I purchased a medium because I hover between medium and small and I didn't want to take any chances of it being too small. It was hard to even purchase this outfit because there aren't any pictures without the cape on Amazon or the internet at all. But it looked so b.a. and much better than all the other options on Amazon that I gave in and bought it. I only ended up using the tan dress and cape because the back piece to the corset is the same color and the original outfit all in all was not as nice as it looks in the picture. The cape was fine especially since it was cold out but everyone kept saying it looked like a cape from frozen haha. The only reason I gave this more than one star is because I ended up buying a black corset in place of the brown one and it looked amazing. So all in all I paid all that money for the ugly brown dress that was too big and the Frozen cape. I didn't even use the belt or the arm pieces. I would not recommend this to anyone.
B0029NYO44|5|This is a great pair of pants. The insides of the pockets are black - very nice in my opinion - making them not as obvious as white can be. The are a very nice fit, while not being too big. We will see how they last but as for first impressions for me, they are fantastic.
B0065DU6YG|5|Patty Women Is Fantastic!!! I Love Her Style!!! I Now Own Seven Of Her Shirts And Plan On Getting More!!!
B00JSJ4T0Q|5|Bought a size up fits and looks great.
B00GD4CZWS|4|nice sweater, great customer service!
B008N8EPC0|5|I love this brand.  I have every color combination. Grab a shirt-any bottom will probably match.  I will never switch brands.
B00F9QBBO4|3|I'm between sizes 8 and 10 (closer to 8), so size M fits me well. Love the color, the material and quality. Kind of expected them to have an inner lining as most sports- and swimwear do. Nope. Disappointing, since I was going to use those as swimsuit bottom. Pretty thick seam goes right between the legs, so some kind of underwear is a must.
B00R5RQ6MC|2|Super cute and quality materials but it runs small!  Plus the arm holes are too big/long so it looks like a wresting singlet on baby =/
B0070U0VF2|5|The reason I bought these pants was because the dog that was used on them is a good representation of a breed that is extremely hard to find.  As an added plus the material was very soft and comfortable.  I would have liked it even more if I could have gotten a shirt in the same print.
B008OSFQNQ|2|The feathers seem to be coming out of every seam in the coat. The fit is so cute and love the fur collar. Super warm but light. I'm sad that I am picking feather off me but am going to keep because I like the coat so much. I don't usually pay this much for Larry Levine since he is at tj maxx on the regular. I probably should have looked their and received for half the price. Then I could deal with the feathers. But at the price it kinda stinks.
B0064TQGTA|2|The pants are extremely long and unrealistic for the size purchased.  The jacket was better and the arms appropriate.  The pants looked sloppy and spoiled the appearance of the suit.
B00KNFQPW4|5|Awesome!
B008AMFXMK|1|It looks so cute in the picture, but when it arrived, golly I was surprised. It lays on you so awkwardly and is very uncomfortable. Deff needs an aquired taste to wear.
B0055GFTCI|3|Honestly it's not that bad, how ever it is smaller then i expected. I wish it was larger and had actual turning gears on it. :]
B00CBWJ8GW|5|Bought this for my daughter's Elmo birthday party.  Fits great, have washed it twice and colors and emblem have not faded.  My daughter loves it.
B003CHZDS2|5|I was very surprised when I received this hat in the mail.  I ordered it for an event I will be attending in July. I ordered it because the price was right but thought I might have to add some embellishments because of the price.  I was delightfully surprised when it arrived.  It is very sparkly and needs nothing to enhance its beauty.
B0051D7ZTA|1|The Lee Women's Misses Relaxed Fit Plain Front Pants were not figure flattering.  During the day they stretched out funning at the knees.  Also the material felt cheap.
B00JJ2WU7G|5|Nice quality for the price.  Just what i needed.
B005V1ZH7Y|3|This shirt is very deceptive in sizing.  It will shrink an entire size after a wash or two.  I originally bought Large, then had to return and buy an XL.  At first it was very roomy.  But once I washed it and dried it, it became a Large (on the smaller side of Large).<br /><br />As for the quality, its simply OK.  Nothing special about this shirt whatsoever...I merely bought it because it was one of the first choices that came up on a search for a plain black tshirt.<br /><br />If you are looking for an average tshirt, that is nothing remarkable, fancy or especially nice - you should consider this one...and buy 1 size up.
B000Q9WILY|5|As usual another great product from Carhartt.  Long enough to keep from feeling the draft when bending over...
B000CEN1J6|5|I bought these for my son when he outgrew his size 2T, and he loves them! They keep him warm at night, which helps with my piece of mind! Would recommend!
B00H3VZUW2|5|These jeans are incredible! I love how they look and they fit me very well. The only thing is I had to shorten them. The length is thirty inches and I need a 28&#34; length.
B003IC5P5W|4|Wonderful hat!!! Perfect accessory for my Mad Hatter costume.
B007HYRPJQ|5|I wore them on the &#34;no pants train ride&#34; flash mob, and people were taking pictures and commenting on how cool they are! Also, the pouch design promotes circulation, and I've noticed an increase in man-energy after I wear them. My only request: PLEASE, if you get them - make sure you have a good body to go with them! These are premium pants! If you don't, you will not look cool and spoil the brand. But if you do, it is a sexy force multiplier!!
B005SY14Y4|5|Thinsulate gloves are so soft and I use mine all the time here in Minnesota. They are so comfortable, warm, and have lasted me about 5 yrs. before I got a little tear in one of the fingers. I would highly recommend these to anyone.
B005ACHJGQ|5|Love this shirt. I wore it to work the very same day I got it. Very flattering evento though I'm on the chubby side anda have a large bust.
B00KYKEV1K|4|Nice t-shirt, but it's too short. Their XXLarge is more like a Large.
B00N1NAQOS|4|good.
B00EKZ8W7O|5|It is soft, vibrant, and flows perfectly with my body. I double it around my neck and it keeps me warm and I get a ton of compliments! I ordered it in 4 different colors! =]
B0050SGTJS|5|I really like this purse.  Good color, but as it is white, it will pick up dirt.  Very roomy and great price.  Nice leather
B007W5KWOK|4|The panties fit pretty well, I just have a slightly larger than average behind so these low rise, cheeky panties do leave my butt hanging out of them a bit. The material is relatively soft, for a polyester/spandex mix. There is a small diamond shaped piece of cloth in the gusset, I'm not sure if it's cotton or not but it's pretty thin. These panties are nice considering the price, I would probably buy again, I just wish the material were a bit nicer.
B00DJRO4H6|4|I purchased for my daughter's 20 year old boyfriend.  He is 6'4&#34; and it was a good fit.
B00F3O06ZM|5|Fit was perfect!  Not too tight or too loose.  Got it for my almost 3 yr old grandson who has a big head.  Fits him just like in the picture.  He likes how soft it feels.
B00ACMTVH4|4|I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my son. It does run a little large. Overall good quality.
B00756VA8S|5|Excellent dress but a little too revealing for me so I wear a colorful T-shirt under it.
B00FG3FJ1G|5|Nice jacket not cheap looking or feel thick heavy material. I love it
B000GKU4DW|4|Great costume especially for the price and better quality than I expected and fun to wear. Not much else to say.
B00BUU2G4C|5|Life.Work.Service.Family.Love & Liberty. Embrace it all - what's the alternative?  Great patch.  :)
B00CXXIG6C|4|I bought this sweater to go with a darling skirt that I have. I liked everything but the length. It raises up and is shorter than I thought.
B00G6S9RFY|5|This was a gift for a friend who is an English teacher and mom. The sound of her laugh was worth every penny. Loved the wide variety of color choices! Thank you.
B00OLNBFYW|5|Good quality
B00IGBR8GO|4|This bathing suit is really cute. Washes well and colors have lasted through the summer.
B007R9MR0S|4|It's hard to know how a straight leg \\"slim fit\\" will actually look until you try them on.  These are just what I was looking for--not too slim and not too wide.  They are well proportioned for the petite gal.  I miss the option of a dark wash and lighter washes that aren't whiskered and worn.  Levis last a long time and I like the \\"wear\\" to come naturally over time.  These have a light whiskering so not too bad.  The rise fits me just right and the waist doesn't pull down in the back when sitting.  Hope to have these for a long time and will be buying more.
B00LGY15US|5|I ordered a pink jersey and it came to me looking beautiful. I absolutely adore it and would love for more products to be put out that's similar to this.
B002IFDXMM|5|Great
B006FX87DI|5|Bought this for a relative.  She loves it and has received lots of compliments.  This is so cute and more fun than the functional blue terry cloth ones.  If you have to wear a bib, this makes you feel better about it (especially the elderly).
