6303234844|5.0|This is the most awesome concert video I have ever seen.  No matter my mood, or how tired I am, if I (or anyone) puts this concert on, it lifts my spirits - and my feet:)  I can't sit down during lots of it.  It is emotional, fun, uplifting and entertaining all in one.  Peter and Paula - WOW!<BR>The only other concert that comes close is Pink Floyd - Pulse.<BR>Can't wait for them both to be out on DVD!
0451191935|5.0|Within this collection of stories is one titled \\"The Long Walk\\" This story punches you in the gut, repeatedly, as you can't tear your eyes away from the atrocities on the page.  The story is amazing as well as the prose.<br />Reading each of these stories is like banging your head against a wall over and over.  It is painful but there is a certain amount of pleasure in the action.  You may not enjoy the concepts of the stories but you will sure enjoy how the storyteller engulfs you with them.
B00003CXXP|5.0|do not have souls!!!!  This movie is like nothing I have seen before.  It is an absolutely amazing film, and (despite what many people say) the last scene is probably the single most beautiful and heart-wrenching piece of cinema that I have experienced in a very long time.  See this movie with somebody that you really care about....like your mom.
0380002930|5.0|I first read this book when I was around 11 years old during the summer reading program at the library.  I re-read this book almost 20 years later and was as engrossed in it as I was the first time.  20-odd years ago it was a fascinating story of what-if's, today it still is.<br />Politics are politics, no matter if you are man or mouse.... or rabbit.  The battle scenes in this story are amazing.  You can almost feel each scratch and bite.  I recommended this book when I was 11 years old and I would recommend it again today to everyone of any age.
6304539282|5.0|For those who don't have the special edition, you're missing a great treat. The added scenes and improved special effects makes these movies well worth watching. Carrie Fisher (Priness Leia) in the bikini is HOT!
B000006MS3|5.0|Outlandish Bush has never been renowend for accesible pop records & the release of this CD bamboozled even the most devoted fans.  Pity, because it is, in my estimation one of the most wonderful albums ever, which showcases Bush's musical genius beyond parallel with quirky & meaningful lyrics & a voice which melts.  Sat In Your Lap, the album's biggest UK Hit is a loud drum-driven song which delivers echoey vocals to a strong piano, drum & male-voice beat.  There Goes A Tenner is a sarcastic cockney style song & the title track is weirdly wonderful.  Top tracks are the gorgeous Night of the Swallow a Celtic style song about robbery & exile.  The subject matter sounds weird but the song is gorgeous with a lilting Irish waltz underlying the lyrics.  Perhaps Kate's best sing after Wutherin Heights. Suspended in Gaffa is quite an uplifting track with a fantastic hook & unsanctioned vocal techniques which are captivatingly original.  22 years after this album's release it is an increased fave in my collection (I was only 8 when I bought it on album!!!) & have enjoyed it ever since.  Bush is one of Britain's biggest musical icons - up there with Bowie, Elton John & Sting - as a musical doyenne.  Recently acknowledged by British Music-Lover's Bible, Q Magazine, as a legend (& honoured for it in  a very rare public appearance), this sadly misunderstood musical genius demonstrates here why she became a superstar at 18 & why despite her intermittent studio releases her fans never forsake her.  They let her be, but some back when she calls.  Divine, sublime & every rhetorical word you can think of, this work may go down as one of the most under-rated albums ever.
0780619951|4.0|THIS MOVIE OFFERS WONDERFUL CREATURE EFFECTS, BEAUTIFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY AND A VERY STRANGE STORY. IT'S NOT MY FAVORITE MOVIE, BUT IT IS WELL WORTH THE VIEWING. THE FIRST HALF OR SO OF THE FILM WILL KEEP YOUR INTEREST, BUT THE SECOND HALF MAY NOT. HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD STICK IT OUT FOR THE FINALE!! JUST REMEMBER, PEOPLE ARE NOT ANIMALS AND IT MAKES A GREAT POINT- NEVER MESS WITH SCIENCE!!!!<BR>SEE THIS FILM, IF NOT FOR THE SPECIAL EFFECTS, BUT FOR THE SCENERY!!!
B00005RFAI|4.0|I loved P!NK's last album & was overwhelmed by her guts & forthrightness. However its crisp r'n'b production has now been replaced by a more rock edge (undoubtedly influenced by Linda Perry, with whom P!nk has co-written many of the songs on Missundastood).  The album comes across as a dark & angry confessional relief for this singer & is at once a challenging & enjoyable listen. Hence the title speaks volumes.  The first couple of listens do take you aback as it is not the same sound as before.  A brave step for P!nk, but a worthwhile one.  The album's top track IMHO is a real gutsy track called 20 Wheeler, which has one of those choruses that hook & wheel you in as P!nk repudiates a lover & declares her autonomy & resilience.  Dark but melodic.  A definite contender for a single which allows P!nk to showcase her voice & its gritty edge.  The first single remains the most uplifting track on the album.  Much of the album appears to be autobiographical - a brave step for a Sophomore album along with deviation from original sound.  Dear Diary (a song about her parents' divorce & troubles in her family),  Missundastood & My Vietnam all have a self-questioning edge, as P!nk examines herself, while the current single Don't Let Me Get Me is angry but brilliant.  With reflection I am astounded by the number of open songs about her life & hope that they bring her the release she needs.  The overall sound of this album veers more to Alanis than to Janet sounds (comes close to The Velvet Rope in theme), but is all the lady's own.  She's a definite talent & I'm only sad I didn't get to see her supporting Janet Jackson in London last year (owing to September 11th).  A definite worthwhile purchase for music fans of all ages.  Just give it a few listens & you'll be hooked:-))))
B00000099Y|5.0|Where do I start?! This is a really tough album to describe,but I'll give it a try...I actually just bought it today.I've known certain songs from this album since they first came out,but at the time of their release,I didn't &quot;get it&quot;- I was completely into ultra-heavy,rattle-your-skull metal at the time (not to say that I don't love that stuff now,because I certainly do),and their sound just didn't appeal to me.But I grew to like,no,love those songs,and it got to the point where I had to get the album... And I'm glad that I did! It's absolutely GENIUS.Dark,progressive (and often epic) hard rock is the best way to describe it.Some people call them the modernday equivalent of Pink Floyd,and they sort of are...no,they don't sound anything like Pink Floyd,but you know what I mean.But back to the album.It's like a massive wall(no P.F. reference intended) of sound from start to finish.And the artwork...whoa! The cover and hologram of California falling into pieces are my favorite,they kinda mess with your sight if you concentrate on them while listening (then again,maybe it's just me).The opening song,&quot;Stinkfist&quot;,is a rockin' tune,very eerie-and pay attention to the lyrics.You might not know it at first,but it's about exactly what you think it's about (hahaha,I'm so immature!)I love every song on this album,even the &quot;filler&quot; tracks that some people complain about.To sum it all up,this  album is original,trippy,dark,heavy,eccentric prog-rock-not for everyone,but well worth looking into.If you already like that style,BUY THIS ALBUM!! It's a true modern masterpiece...
B00005QDW1|5.0|Thi CD really rocks. The first time I listened to the whole CD I was skeptical, but the more I listened to it and after I read the lyrics, it got better and better. My CD is soon to have a worn out hole in it from being played so much. The style of music is a lot different from their past CDs but that's what makes it so great. It's different with a lot of variety. There's something on it for everyone. The track \\"Rock Steady\\" is the greatest track on the whole album.
B0000636UN|5.0|The four years in the making were worth every minute, if this doesn't make album of the year I will be crushed. It is a good, hard-rocking album that I cannot get enough of! It has been the only CD in my player for the last week. Please don't wait another four years! The guest vocalists are an incredible addition to a great talent. Thanks Sheryl!
B00005TT77|4.0|This album is fantastic!  Those who say otherwise have fallen victim to the sharply defined limitations they automatically  place on any album that even mentions the Fab Four.  Mimicry is not what you'll find in this album.  The fact that each of &quot;the artists...interpreted these songs with so much affection&quot; (cover) really gives this album a punch and definition that no exact replica of beloved riffs would.   It is a thoroughly happy and new experiance from the moment the disc is slipped in and most certainly expresses the love of story and song that is its intention.
B0000028RR|5.0|Most good bands (even some of my favorites) kinda [stink] at first; their first album is usually pretty weak but shows potential. Now granted, I have not heard a Rage album that I didn't like; but this debut doesn't have potential, it is already there. <br />If you've even heard of Rage Against the Machine, then you probably already know about their unique sound that mixes metal, hip hop, and even a bit of punk. You probably already know how their guitarist is easily the best  around today, and how Zach de la Rocha rolls poetic yet anger-filled words off his tongue in a mix of rap and actual singing. If you don't own any other Rage albums, this is certainly a great one to start with. If you own some other ones then you will definately love the sound on this CD. This CD is an absolute must have for any fan of any genre of rock. The guitars are incredible, the lyrics are great, and this is instrumentally one of the best CDs ever made.
B00005B36H|3.0|This album bores me to [tears].   For one thing the songs are very epic good in one sense until you find out that the songs are too layered and has a Pink Floyd feeling to it.  No more are the songs give a crunchy guitar sound combined with a epic play length as was Aenema and undertow.  I miss the more hardcore styling as was on opiate it had more of a rollercoaster flow to it.  On lateralus I have to fight through long song lengths to get to any good parts withing the song.  Such as Maynard giving some black metal scream which did impress me.  I'd like to see Tool try and combine some old formulas with the new say combine Lateralus with Undertow or Opiate.  Otherwise their music just isn't going to cut it with me anymore.
0385503954|3.0|After reading glowing reviews for this novel, I was very excited to start it, and found myself deeply engrossed in Part One, which is set during one long, hot summer's day at an England manor house.  Treachery, lust, betrayal, and violence occur, shattering a child's view of the world around her.  It is a startling, unpredictable start...unfortunately, Parts Two and Three (McEwan seems to think of his novel as theatrical, in the tradition, I suppose of Greek tragedy) can't measure up.  I personally find war fiction to be incredibly boring, so was disappointed to find that Part Two was all about WWII.  And Part Three, as an elderly woman travels home for a family reunion, feels surprisingly cloying when placed next to the dark, brooding suspense of Part One.  The novel feels very uneven, and I was disappointed to see it go downhill, especially since the beginning is so promising.
B000060MY6|4.0|&quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is about dreams--both kinds.  The kind we have at night and the ones we wish while we're awake.<br />The dream of a successful career in Hollywood has motivated many, mostly to their extreme disappointment.  How such may become tragedy is the driving force behind the film, and what makes it worthwhile.<br />The dreams at night, mostly the dreadful ones, are Lynch's stock in trade.  They are expertly portrayed in the film, even a few humorous ones.  They stick in the mind, disturbingly, for days.  They are acceptable as a character-development device, but as Lynch goes overboard in trying to titillate weirdness addicts, he distances the majority of even intellegent and discerning moviegoers.  Why do that, when he has something to say about the first kind of dream, our hopes when awake?  A shame, given the superb cinematography and acting.  A shame, when zombie-like pacing, appropriate for the dreadful dreams, numbs those who might otherwise have appreciated the film more.  The thud-chord musical score doesn't help, either.<br />For it's overemphasis on the dreadful dream, the film may remain the cult favorite of young figure-it-outers, but never become an accepted masterpiece of cinema.  On the other hand, for figure-it-outers who would like a TRULY profound experience of substance, I recommend Von Trier's &quot;Zentropa.&quot;
B00005JKJA|5.0|When watching this movie for the first time your initial reaction is gonna &quot;WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT&quot;? After watching it again your gonna say &quot;well I never noticed this before.&quot; After watching it a third time the thing you noticed before isn't gonna make a whole lotta sense because something is off with the scene. My point is for those of you trying to decipher this film and make sense out of it don't bother. When you think you have a grip on it something happens in the movie that turns it all upside down. I'm not gonna bother explaining any plot here, because it wouldn't do any good. This was the best movie of 2001.
B00004SZWD|5.0|No other album comes close to this. I wish, Sir Duke, As, Isn't she lovely, Joy inside my tears, Pastime Paradise, and every other song on this album are slammin'. This is a must buy item!
B000002N3J|5.0|Another great collection of Madonna songs.  If you are looking for her upbeat songs, these aren't them.  This is a great collection of her ballads, popular and not so popular.  I am a big fan of her music, mostly the dance songs, but couldn't resist this one because it has some of her not so popular songs such as Oh, Father and Love Don't Live Here Anymore which we never hear enough of.  Add this CD to your collection.
B00005B36H|5.0|Well, at the time of this review I had owned this album since last May.  It's changed my life, and I'm still not through listening to all of it.<BR>The first time I gave this disc a spin, I was sortof...alienated.  You see, this was my first experience with Tool.  I skipped up to Schism, gave it a listen, and then turned it off.  Boy, that was a dumb mistake.<BR>Next time I vowed to listen to the entire thing...and I couldn't.  I made it to about Parabola, then got bored.  <BR>It took me a while, but I finally finished this album, all the way to the strange trip of Faaip de Oiad.  It took until about last October for the album to take its full effect on me.  I was a Tool junkie, and I feel like this album had a great effect on my life.  Probably yours too, if you gave it a listen.  I wouldn't reccomend it for those with low attention spans (radio listeners, beware!).
B00005JKBC|1.0|I had the same problem with my Toshiba DVD player. It is simply not possible to turn off the hearing impaired captions. UGH. I have been waiting to see this movie and now I need to put up with these captions all over the screen. Thumbs down Universal!
630469797X|4.0|Zombies are overrunning the world, and four survivors take refuge in a mall.  George A. Romero's highly popular and quite lengthy zombie tale features several flaws, which include a cheesy musical score, weak acting from Gaylen Ross, and the occasional bit of shoddiness in the make-up department.  Still, this is highly recommended material, thanks to the numerous carnage-filled action sequences (particularly the beginning and the finale)(and I swear, you'll never see a movie with more bloody gunshots to the head!), the mostly effective satire and emphasis on characterization, and a terrific lead performance from Ken Foree.
B00000K0DU|4.0|A serial killer who quacks like Donald Duck (!) is prowling the streets of New York and is violently murdering the city's most attractive women. Very sleazy film from director Lucio Fulci has the requistite bad acting, as well as a LOT of sex/nudity and general unpleasantness, which is a pretty big distraction from an otherwise suspenseful and even quite frightening Italian giallo. There are an abundance of heart-pounding segments and the twist ending is pretty clever, which makes it one of the few mysteries that surprised me with the killer's identity! Definitely recommended to giallo and suspense buffs, so long as you can stand an extreme amount of bloody, sleazy death scenes.<BR>*** 1/2 out of *****
B00003CXTG|3.0|I liked the movie overall, but I hated the cursing and the fornication. I'm not a script writer for movies or a writer at all, but I do know that the best books and movies have done without it. Frankly, I don't know why people keep watching movies with cursing, fornication, and a lot of other crude elements like that. I really don't see that it makes it any better at all, only worse. I know a lot of people disagree with me and/or don't like me at all for writing this, but I just have too, because I'm a Christian, which are suppossed to be salt(to preserve) and light(to shed light in the dark places and to show how ugly sin is). I don't mean to wag my tongue, I know I'm not perfect, no one is, except God and I know He doesn't have favorites, because the Bible says so. I know that movies with these types of features will keep being made and most people will keep watching them, but the importent thing is, that we do what God says. I have read the Bible and I believe it's the written Word of God, so what I'm getting at is, since God is omniscient(all-knowing) and omnipotent(all-powerful), I think I should listen to Him. It's only logical. Read Philippians 4:8 and Colosians 3:2 (God wrote this too, and He doesn't do anything in a vain) about what to think about.
B000001FA4|4.0|Many could say this is the Joshua Tree in embryo, but it's definitely not second rate. Here are each of the songs ranked out of ten. (1 being bad through ten being excellent).<br />1. A Sort Of Homecoming (10/10): A great opening song. Passionate vocals by Bono, great guitar by the Edge.<BR>2. Pride (In The Name Of Love): (10/10) Classic U2<BR>3. Wire (8/10): A pretty good track, just not deserving of a ten. The intro by The Edge is great, though.<BR>4. The Unforgettable Fire (9/10): A good track, but I think I listened to it too much when I got the Best of 1980-1990, still it's a powerful track.<BR>5. Promenade (6.5/10): The only minor flaw in this album because Promenade is not a very exciting or great track, it's sort of boring.<BR>6. 4th Of July (7/10): It kind of reminds you of fireworks shooting into the sky. I like to think of it as a prelude to Bad.<BR>7. Bad (10+/10): \\"We're an Irish band, we come from Dublin City, Ireland, like all cities it has its good and it has its bad, this is a song called Bad\\"  That's how Bono preluded their spectacular performance of this song at Live Aid.  The version here is also very good.  An essential U2 track.<BR>8. Indian Summer Sky (10/10): A great follow up to Bad. Again great lyrics by Bono, excellent instrumental backing track.<BR>9. Elvis Presley And America (20/10): I guess the reviewer who said Elvis Presley and America did not rank as a great song didn't really listen to this track because it is AWESOME!... Though the words are hard to decipher (I went to u2.com for the lyrics) this song, again, captures Bono's energy like Tracks 1 and 7. Could be great live.<BR>10. MLK (10/10): Ah, yes, the closing song. The title really fits the words since the song is obviously about Martin Luther King Jr. Great closer to an underrated album.
B00005ATQI|5.0|The scariest things about scary movies to me is their ability to make you go &quot;oh my god!&quot; and this movie sure did it. This is incredibly disturbing, especially the scenes of the slaughtered little girls, the little boy with the knife in his hand repeating &quot;redrum&quot; in that weird voice, the graphically unnecessary old lady in the bathtub scene, and of course the elevator full of blood. I have also never seen such a good crazy guy ever done before. This is one of the top three horror movies ever made and is definitely very scary!
B00005JKJA|5.0|I am not  exactly a fan of David Lynch. However, I find his movies interesting, and I usually find his movies good eventhough I have no idea why  I say they're good. Mulholland Drive is a visual narrative without a timeline. It was intriguing, sexy and inventive.<BR>The DVD version contains nothing other than the movie, the trailor and text information about the actors. I was hoping to see the Director's commentary. There was none. It was also interesting that the DVD did not have chapters (which, I am sure is done on purpose to further reflect the meaning of the film.) All in all, a good film that requires more than one viewing.
B00005LB9O|4.0|I bought this CD not ever having heard one single song from Travis because a friend of mine recommended it and Scott Weiland from STP said they had a lot of talent.<br />I'm really glad I did.  Not to be too cliche-ish, but it was like a breath of fresh air.  The opening song, &quot;Sing&quot; just blew me away.  It's a really great song.  There's nothing not to like on the whole album, really.  It's easy like Sunday morning.  You know, one of those CDs you can pop in and just listen and enjoy.  My favorites are &quot;Sing&quot; and &quot;Flowers in the window&quot;.<br />If you like good music, you'll like this.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Nothing to really say about this film, except that EVERYONE should see it at least once.  One of the best films I've ever seen, and a great dvd to boot.
B000002IZ4|5.0|I don't know that I can say anything to do this album justice.  I truly believe that it is the greatest album of all time, period.  It is totally timeless.  Every single song is incredible.  The lyrics are the best STP has given us, the music is powerful and I never tire of hearing Scott Weiland belt out &quot;Interstate love song&quot; or any of the other awesome songs on the album.  I love that STP, as a hard rock band, is so beautifully melodic.  And the music is so intelligent as well as pleasing to the ear.<br />STP is my favorite band and I love everything they've put out, but this is the album I listen to practically day in and day out.  <br />If you are a fan of really good music, you must own this!
B00005QIPH|5.0|I must admit that &quot;Is this it&quot; is the best rock album since Nevermind from Nirvana.Placebo was doing always the same kind of music, but was trying to make some new wave, the smashing Smashing pumpkins have splitted, Radiohead has nearly become an elctronic band, so I welcome with satisfaction &quot;Is this it&quot;. This opus shows the return of the real rock, the rock that gives us the shivers, the rock that makes us want to stop leastening to electro.
B00005JHAB|5.0|This film was a fantastic, feel-good, romantic comedy, the kind you want to watch over and over again (preferably with a box of chocolates).  Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughy shine in this brilliant romance.  The kind of warm and fuzzy type of film that most romantics at heart will thoroughly enjoy.  A true Chick's Flick about weddings and finding your soul mate. It's a MUST-SEE!
B00005A1PR|5.0|This Cd is awesome. Every song has a meaning. Its so empowering to listen and understand the words and the meaning.I really think that India Arie should have won a Grammy. Her Cd is so much better than Alicia Keys.I think everyone should listen to the cd and understand it.SO BUY IT!
B00003CXXP|5.0|First off let me just say that many people who are bashing this film are mainly bashing it and calling it a steven spielberg film...and that's where they are wrong! Sure some changes were made after the great Stanley Kubrick passed away but this still has the feel of a classic Kubrick film. The people who have seen Eyes Wide Shut (which is a very beautiful and haunting film) bashed it mainly because they didn't have a good knowledge of Kubrick and the way he worked. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman drew people to the theater but it wasn't the stuff they expected from them and that's how it should've been and was. With A.I. Kubrick let Spielberg into his vision and a project that he held so near and dear to his heart and had been working on since the mid 80's. When Kubrick passed away Spielberg was given the chance to helm A.I. and create Kubrick's vision. Kubrick originally wanted Steven to direct the film and he'd produce but Steven was thinking the opposite but with Stanley's death he really had no choice. A.I. is a beautiful and mezmerizing collaboration between two of the greatest directors ever and comes out so well. To some Kubrick's films may be a total bore because of their length and how Stanley really got into telling a story in full detail and never cut any corners but Kubirck was never the type of guy Spielberg is that has the mainstream appeal and his films were often cult hits and not the big blockbusters like Spielbergs (which is another reason many people are bashing this film but to me it's his greatest work since E.T., his best film and one of the best of all time). A.I. is a fairytale and nothing more than that and that's what I rook from the film. Haley plays a robot who is very much like any other human being and that's all he wants to be treated like. He's looking for love just like everyone else but because he's not a real boy he's not treated the same way. All he wants is for his mother's love but doesn't understand why he can't have it and he realises if he find the blue fairy he will be able to become a real boy and his mothers love he will have. The ending is such a beautiful ending and I really don't see some people's problems with it. -SPOLIERS- David makes every possible attempt to show his mother than he is just like everyone else and wants to be a real boy and does so no matter how long it takes. 2,000 years pass and David still wants to prove that his love and already has shown that he is just as real as everyone else. David finds out that his mother has died along time ago but has a chance to bring her back for just one day and it proves how real he is and how much emotion he has when he accpets it just to hear his mother say she loves him and to show his mother how much he loves her.-END SPOILER- It's a very hearwarming and emotional ending and even though it's not what we'd expect from Kubrick in the end Spielberg throws his visions into the final half hour of the film and put his stamp on A.I.! Kubrick had so much faith in Spielberg and was Kubrick's choice and it's sad that people bash Spielberg for his visions and wanting to make Kubrick's dream film a reality! For those that have yet to see this or were turned away by bad reviews (I had huge expectations for the film and when it came out the bad reviews piled up and turned me off of it until now)please don't listen to all the negative stuff and view this movie and make your own opinions on it. Kubrick's stuff is either understood or misunderstood and with Spielberg in the mix it made it alot different to review a film like this! What an amazing and beautiful film A.I. is!
B00003CXXS|4.0|Proving that bigger doesn't always mean better, you have Jurassic Park 3 as the perfect example. While not a bad film, and certainly entertaining, don't go looking for character developement, intricate plot, or any of that truly special stuff. Instead, you get big budget special effects, big bad dinos with an attitude, somewhat campy acting, and the perfect thrill ride for kids 12 and under. Another of the film's problems is the fact that this movie is WAY too short. It seems that the filmmakers said: &quot;OK, we have 90 minutes of footage, let's just tack on an ending and get it over with as soon as possible.&quot; The abrupt ending felt odd and out of place. All that taken together makes JP3 the weakest entry in the entire Jurassic Park series. It's missing the magic touch that Spielberg gave to Jurassic park and The Lost World. So all in all, not a bad movie, just don't expect too much.<br />After their son, Eric, (Trevor Morgan) has had a parasailing accident on Isla Sorna a divorced couple, Amanda (Tea Leoni) and Paul (William H. Macy) Kirby kidnap Dr. Alan Grant into taking them to Isla Sorna to find their son. But, the plane crashes, and now they're stranded. Worst of all, they have a big bad dino called Spinosaurus coming after them. Will the group be able to make it off the island before they become the Spinosaurus' next meal?<br />Overall Grade: B+ (9++++)
B00005N9CV|4.0|The Look of Love differs from Krall's prior recording in that every song is backed by large string arrangements.  Like many of the other reviewers, I miss the more intimate and concentrated impact of her trio.  Still, she has one of the finest voices today, and her phrasing only gets better.  I would probably buy a CD of her singing the phone book.  However, she is an excellent jazz pianist as well as a singer, and the latter is lost in the string arrangements.  Of course, many jazz musicians have recorded with strings, including Charlier Parker.  My hope is that this is only a temporary diversion.<br />As for the merits of the album, the string arrangements are quite well done and the songs well selected.  Particular highlights are the title track, and Cry Me A River.  I would certainly recommend purchase of this CD; if you want a jazzier recording, you should get her tribute album to Nat King Cole.
B000056V73|5.0|I dont care - this picture is ALMOST GREAT. Ive already seen Crowes Jerry Maguire and Vanilla Sky and they were very good (especially Vanilla Sky I really dont understand why so much people don't like this beautiful movie). But this is his best work of art.<br />Well, at first I was thinking: Hmmm This is kind of good movie... but I don't like it a lot, it's not my culture it is far from my interests, I've never liked rock n roll a lot... And so far I had a great stomach-ache and so I had to postpone watching it...<br />The next morning I woke up with no ache. And so I thanked God and continued watching film. And... and I think it was one of the best movies Ive seen this year or maybe ever. Great acting, great music (I still don't like this type of music a lot, but it was great. A kind of surprise was Lou Reeds Im waiting for the man, I really adore cover-version of this song performed by my favorite singer Vanessa Paradis), great screenplay, great work of all the film's cast. So I want to thank everybody who made this touching, happy and lyrical picture about music, love, life and growing-up. To thank them all.
0553106635|4.0|I admit it--I'm hooked.  Three books into George R.R. Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, and I can't wait for the next one.  A word to all publishers, though:  You would sell more hardcover copies if you'd consider lowering the price.  I had to wait a year until I could spare the [money] for a chunk of paper and cardboard.<br />That aside . . . Martin writes the grittiest fantasy I've read that doesn't turn me off the characters completely.  Then again, his characters are human despite their flaws--they strike a chord of recognition, a wish to know them or a prayer that they'll get what they deserve.  The situation is also quite realistic--the devastation of war and the intrigues for power are well done, and Martin's quick, to-the-mark prose doesn't hurt at all.<br />Yes, the book is long; yes, it'll take time to get through it (six hours for me).  It's also another transitionary book.  But with the scope Martin's planning, with as many characters as he has, \\"Storm\\" has to be a transition.  And it's fantastic.  While Catelyn and Robb meet a fate no one could have predicted, Arya becomes as hardened and cruel as the monsters she escaped (I hope this poor child will have someone to ~talk~ to in the end); Jon Snow's time among the wildlings is heartbreaking, but in the end he confronts himself and his place in the world.  Joffrey and Stannis take different directions in the success of their reigns.  And Daenerys . . . ah, Daenerys.  My favorite female character in the series, Dany exhibits a compassion at odds with an ability to use people like no other.  If you aren't cheering after the scene in the Place of Punishment, you haven't been paying much attention.<br />I wanted to give this three stars because it's tragic and I honestly felt ready for Prozac when I was finished.  Then I tried going to sleep after finishing what has to be the creepiest epilogue in modern fantasy.  Do yourself a favor.  Before finishing \\"Storm\\", make sure it's daylight.  And read something else to keep from remembering the book's final page.ing else to keep from remembering the book's final page.
B000000OTU|5.0|When Aerosmith releases new stuff, I know I can expect to hear some real rock and roll. No whiney, grungey, hard rock stuff with no character or presence. Character and presence are two of the top things this band has. They give us straight up no questions asked rock and roll. With music as dysmal as ever today, we need these type of artists more than ever. This type of music. This set covers the 80's period, as well as the early 90's stuff as well. It would've been nice to have the 70's stuff on here too. I guess you have to buy seperate. This set of songs chronicle the Boston band's incredible comeback in the mid 80's up to the early 90's. No other artist or band has had such a magnificent comeback. &quot;Rag Doll&quot; is a big rhythm catcher with an incredible catchy drum beat. &quot;What It Takes&quot; is a great power ballad that just may be one of the band's finer moments. The strong message song &quot;Janie's Got A Gun&quot; is here as well. There is a trio of songs here that sort of go together. Those songs being &quot;Crazy&quot;, &quot;Amazing&quot;, and &quot;Cryin'&quot;. Some of the best tracks here are ones that aren't as well known as others. &quot;The Other Side&quot; and &quot;Deuces Are Wild&quot; are bouncy and rockin'. Perfect Aerosmith songs. Then there is &quot;Walk On Water&quot;, the first track on the CD. It has a great catch. Then there is the big power ballad &quot;Angel&quot;, which was their highest chart hit until &quot;I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing&quot; went to #1 in 1998. The guys are impecable rock and roll musicians. Steven Tyler is one of rock's most flashy and entertaining band leaders. Not to mention having one of the best rock and roll voices ever. Listen to &quot;Dream On&quot; and listen to how unbelieveably different his voice is. It's almost shocking. Aerosmith and their music aren't here to change the world. It's not here to cure cancer or to feed the poor. It's here to rock and entertain. To just be music. It doesn't need to be anything else. It's fun, it's catchy, it's rocking. That's all you need. I laugh when I hear young kids today bashing them or whoever. They were brought up on 90's music and the music of today. Not the best of stuff to be weaned on. With so many rock bands and artists today looking, acting, and singing the same way, Aerosmith and their ilk are a breath of fresh air. That someone out there is still doing it the way it should be. One hopes it continues for a long time. The music of today isn't giving much hope to the future. Long live Aerosmith. You guys keep rocking.
B00005JKQX|1.0|I should have walked out of this movie 30 minutes into the show. I am amazed at the level of \\"cookie-cutter\\" sentimentality and plot ploys that were contrived to produce this movie. The dialogue was so lame I found myself audibly snorting in disbelief. And what about Jennifer Connelly? Was that acting? Rusell Crowe did a two-star job under horrible, flat directing. A Beautiful Mind insults all of our original and good instincts. What a piece of garbage!!
0446608955|5.0|The story all starts with 17-year-old Landon Carter. He is what alot of people would call a 'rebel'. He is suddenly without a date for the homecoming dance, and as a result of desperation, he asks Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. He thought she would be the last person on the planet he would ever fall in love with, but as they are put in situations together, gradually he does. Even though she comes to feel the same way about Landon, Jamie is not sure it would be the best thing for them, because she has an eternal secret that could tear them apart, or keep them together. Soon the problem isn't who will know about the secret, but who will stand by your side all the way through it. I give this book 5 out of 5, because it is and always be one of the most heart breaking stories you will hear. -Derek

B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney has returned with her third studio release titled \\"Britney\\". I like it better than all of her other discs, and I think she is on her way of being the next Madonna! While she relies more on computer sqeaks and more of an R&B sound, she is also stressing the issue of not being a little girl any more, but at the same time, not a mature woman (I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman). She even got to work with Justin (though they later broke up) on the last song \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\". Brit has even co-wrote 5 of the 12 songs.
630018403X|5.0|This movie is not only an 80's classic, but can teach teenagers valuable lessons.  The whole storyline teaches teens that everyone can be insecure and doubt themselves at times, and that you should never judge a book by its cover.  People who seem like they are \\"hard-core\\" or who seem to \\"have it all\\" have just as many personal struggles as the next guy (or girl).  It teaches acceptance and self-esteem lessons as well.  The language is pretty harsh, but realistic.  I would recommend a parent watching this movie with their teen and discussing it with them.  Teens may only see the entertainment value unless a parent or other responsible adult helps uncover the messages hidden in the storyline.  Excellent movie!!!
B000000OSO|5.0|Get a Grip is a great Aerosmith album.  Who ould have thought  they could top Pump? It has awesome songs that everyone knows like Cryin, Eat the Rich and Crazy, but I think the best stuff on the album are the songs most people dont know...for example, Get a Grip, Gotta Love it, Flesh, etc...anyway...its a great album, go out and get it!!!

B00005R2M3|4.0|Shakira, already a singing sensation in her native Columbia releases her first English album Laundry Service where the upbeat and irresistibly catchy Whenever, Wherever launches her to pop-stardom with the delicious hooks and her Alanis yodels. Shrewd marketing to showcase her talent, the label &quot;Entire album produced by Shakira&quot; calls desperately for attention - yet there isn't any necessity for it. Shakira is in her own element and style in the whole album, irrepressible and zesty as she dances through the flamingo beats of Objection (Tango), belts out the melancholic hues of Underneath my clothes and shatters hearts with THE ONE in her affirmation of her only love. She pumps up the beat with Ready for the Good times and then slyly slips back into her rocking style with Fool. Even her lyrics is personal through not always clever, yet it is sincerely Shakira's when weird lyrics like &quot;So I shaved my legs&quot; struts out. Even funnier is the English translation of Eyes like mine by Gloria Estefan. This album is a good introduction to Shakira's singing prowess yet it is unsatisfying with only seven to eight songs in English and repeated songs in Spanish. If only there were more original English works of her instead of reverting back to her Spanish roots for back-up, Laundry Service would be worth more than a spin. It is nonetheless catchy pop that is anything but washed-out.
B00005OWIU|5.0|When I stepped into the theatre to see Harry Potter, let's face it, I wasn't expecting all that much. The books are great, sure, but movies based off of books are almost never good if you've read the book first, which is the case with almost every book-based movie I've ever seen. The movie was alright, good for the kids, but being a long-time John Williams fan, I was looking forward to seeing if his spark and talent will keep going after all these years, and all these movies. Ladies and gentlemen, I can say without a doubt, that John Williams has produced yet another masterpiece which shall be appreciated and loved by music lovers such as myself throughout the generations. Do not hesitate to buy this CD, or any of John Williams' other works.<br />A wondeful masterpiece.
0064430227|5.0|This cute story was a favorite of mine growing up and is now a beloved treasure of my son.  Harold inspires imagination in children through his creations with his Purple Crayon.  The only downfall, a lesson my mother had to learn with my brother, you have to emphasize to a young child not to truly attempt drawing all over the house.  This story is perfect for the child that loves to daydream or that may need some encouragement to imagine in today's technological world.
079284632X|5.0|Warning this MGM release is the heavily censored 82mn R rated version & is also zoomed in,so your looseing even more picture information!Since plenty of other reviewers have commented on the disturbing aspect of the film + loveing it or hating it naturally. I'm gonna comment on the other over-looked aspect of the film...and that of a pitch black comedy.Theres the 'amaturish' acting,dialogue & so on. The upbeat folk music played througout a few scenes.You can't tell me you did'nt laugh out loud at the sheer outragousness of the very twistedly funny felatio sequence?Or the introduction to the villains via the news radio report with Krug popping alittle kids ballon with a cigar?Not to mention the two cops who have some very funny moments together,all woven into a outragously entertaining & brutal mix of slapstick comedy & disturbing torture & violence.The tone of the film is changing rapidly throughout the film...from comedy,to revolting horror & back again....& it makes for a wild ride for those with open minds & who understand that it is a low budget film...so don't expect a 'pristinely filmed,acted maintstream' film here.The film isn't for everyone....& it may start off carefree & humorous....but quickly turns serious with it's depiction of rape & torture & murder. That part of the film is the hardest to watch as it's so raw & unnerving & VERY sad what these girls go through & the haunting music that acompanies the scene adds to the bleakness of it all.If you feel revolted durring this portion of the film.....thats how your supposed to feel!...this is not a glorified 'hollywood' depiction of villians & murder...but a sad,realistic & shocking unpleasent veiw of how wrong violence really is. Even the parents revenge at the end isn't justified....because after-all they became just as bad as the villains. So no one really wins & leaves unchanged from this experiance...violence isn't pretty no matter what it's for.This film is and always will be a classic & all-time favorite of mine. I just wish i'd have the chance to see the fully uncensored version of the film.....but the footage may be lost for good....though theres been news that MGM has located a completely uncut print of the film & should be releasing a special edition dvd sometime soon!Maybe there's hope after all? We'll have to wait & see.
0517122707|5.0|A Confederacy of Dunces is chock-full of unforgettable and unique characters, especially its \\"hero\\" - Ignatius J. Reilly, an obese, egotistical, self-proclaimed authority on EVERYTHING.  He has a knack for failing at whatever he does; in many ways he's an almost grown-up Charlie Brown (without all of Charlie's good points).  His misadventures are downright hilarious, as are those of the other characters.  The plot isn't terribly complicated, but pay attention, because even seemingly insignificant encounters ultimately play a larger role in the novel.  In my opinion, this book truly deserved the Pulitzer Prize and I highly recommend it;  John Kennedy Toole was able to not only bring the characters to life but also give the reader an idea of what life is like in vibrant New Orleans. However, this is not a book for the easily offended because it is definitely not politically correct.
B00005NW02|5.0|Let me start by saying that i was extremely nervous about buying this cd. I loved Chop Suey and had a hunger for more SOAD and bugged my friends for more of their music and was rewarded with aerials, and sugar ( yes this is from their other cd.) After listening to those 3 songs for a week I decided to buy one of their cds...but i couldnt pick which one...so i bought both. Now heres the reveiw. This was my first Cd of this type. Soad doesnt seem to really fit in to any of the catagories for music...soad is just soad. This Cd has a lot more heavy music than just Chop Suey.Interestingly enough Chop suey lies right in the middle of the cd, separating the heavier music such as prison song and X from the softer songs such as Aerials and Atwa. Chop suey is a good mix and basic representation of Soads music.Basically the best way to decide if you want this cd is to listen to the 30 second preveiws offered by amazon. Most of the samples have a section of the song and its transitions from harder music to softer. Go out,buy, listen, enjoy.
B00004WIDR|5.0|Hurry! Go click \\"Add to Cart!\\"<br />This one was SO MUCH better than the original--it had WAY more action! I don't want to sit through a dinosaur movie to learn about CLONING--I want to see the dinosaurs chase people!!!<br />My favorite part was when the T-Rex was hiding on the boat, and then jumped out to get everyone when it crashed on the dock. How cool is it that the T-Rex killed everyone on board, then snuck back into his hiding place when it got close to land? The answer: VERY cool.<br />Ian Malcolm's daughter was a great addition to the cast--I stood up and cheered when she pummeled the velociraptor. It made me want to take gymnastics lessons! You go, girl!!!<br />The only part of this movie that didn't bowl me over was Vince Vaughn's character. I thought he was too smarmy. The director must have thought so too, since Mr. Vaughn disappeared without explanation halfway through the movie - no big loss. I liked Mr. Vaughn much better in the \\"Psycho\\" remake.<br />I also think it was smart to completely ignore the island from the first movie. Even though they left dinosaurs alive at the end of \\"Jurassic Park,\\" it was like a cool conspiracy that there would be another island with even MORE species on it. <br />Since \\"Lost World\\" was a hundred times better than the first movie, I can only assume \\"Jurassic Park III\\" is the best one of all!
B00003XB8K|4.0|I'm not familiar with Carl Orff but apparently Carmena Burana is being carefully sampled on songs such as &quot;The Gate&quot;, &quot;Modern Crusaders&quot; and &quot;Gravity Of Love&quot; where Ruth-Ann of Olive lends her seductive vocals as she croons over a mid-tempo groove caressed by the arching chorus of &quot;Carmina&quot;. These samplings give the album's ethnic grooves a more classical feel which also makes the songs overwhelmingly powerful. The Gregorian chantings which Enigma is known and loved for are sadly obsolete throughout the record but the synthy beats and ethereal background vocals (provided by Sandra Cretu and Elisabeth Houghton) give the album a more polished sound. But before you misconstrue what I'm saying please note that this is probably Enigma's worst album to date as there is not much to rave about. On the other hand, however, there is really nothing to whine about either. The album is highly enjoyable with dance grooves harmonizing perfectly with soothing ambience - there's just no rememberable songs here like Sadness and Mea Culpa. Some of my favorites though have got to be &quot;Silence Must Be Heard&quot; (which also features the vocals of Ruth-Ann), &quot;Modern Crusaders&quot; (which has more of a progressive rock sound because of Cretu's vocals and guitar playing), &quot;The Screen Behind The Mirror&quot; (which features pipes of some sort, giving it a haunting effect amidst soaring beats), and &quot;Camera Obscura&quot; (which has a heavy dance swirl). I also think that the subtle &quot;Between Min &amp; Heart&quot; is a beautiful new age song with a melodic twist...<br />This album may not be as good as Enigma's earlier works but it's definitely worth buying. And if you're just beginning to build up your Enigma collection than start with their Greatest Hits compilation: Love Sensuality Devotion.
B0000028M7|5.0|...  Alice in Chains was a wonderful group of artists, I remember this album more than any other as having a tremendous impact on the music industry.  <br />In terms of talent and musicianship, I think Alice in Chains had all other Seattle acts blown away with this release.  This album meant a tremendous amount to me and still does, without such an album acts like Staind would have no material.<br />...  Like many great releases, this one reminds me of instances in my life and seems to bring me back to them, like some sort of time machine.  Kurt Cobaine still does that for me, as does Bradley Nowell.  I will miss Layne Staley, he was a wonderful artist.  <br />With any luck, The Dirt release will now be looked back upon for its value, and fewer ... bands will freely copy the style and get their own, I doubt it though.  That might actually mean applying effort.
B00004RIUV|3.0|If you check out the cover art for this David Geffen sponsored release, you will see the improbable sight of Gene Clark wearing makeup.  Take that as a warning.  This record is wildly overproduced.  <br />\\"From a Silver Phial\\" is flat-out fantastic.  But, tellingly, it is the shortest track on this album.  \\"Strength of Strings\\" is a great Clark opus but the arrangement is far too long at six and a half minutes.  \\"Life's Greatest Fool\\" is entertaining with its odd gospel backup singers.  \\"No Other\\" (the song) sounds like an effort by Clark to stretch himself musically but it doesn't really work.  \\"Some Misunderstanding\\" is plodding;  it's a bit like a mean parody of Gene Clark's work.  <br />I differ with the other writers here. This is not a great album, but the good stuff is very much worth having.  The excesses remind me that this comes from the era and the town that gave David Bowie and John Lennon their worst years in terms of mental health (drugs, drugs, drugs) and is not too long after Gram Parsons expired for the same reason.  Thank God the same demons weren't yet destined to take Gene from us.

B00005PJ8O|5.0|PATTON is the combination of authentic biography and excellent war film-making. It engages in breath-taking character development of a prominent figure in American military history, and does so without romanticizing the character. Twenty-first century movie-goers will notice that some scenes betray the age of the picture, but its message is very much for our time.<br />Despite being filmed during the Vietnam War, PATTON does not feature the anti-war rhetoric that has handicapped almost every Hollywood war movie since. This movie concentrates on casting General George S. Patton as he really was -- an inspiring leader and a colorful character. Yet in doing so, it does not shy away from pointing out how the spicy language and gruff persona that so successfully spurred soldiers into battle often held him back in a world uncomfortable in grappling with larger-than-life individuals. <br />Here the myth is debunked that modern warfare tactics prevent the emergence of great men. PATTON provides a refreshing break from current revisionist trends among history academics that de-emphasize the role of individuals and dismiss the importance of military history in the affairs of humanity. While Patton certainly existed and was responsible for landmark Allied victories against the Nazis, Patton is the solid kind of figure a history professor in the average American university would try to hide from impressionable undergraduate students.<br />PATTON presents an interesting question to those of us in the modern world: we need men of war to win battles, but can we be tolerant of the military culture in times of peace? Patton's life suggested that the answer to this question was advancing towards the negative even in the 1940's. How farther popular culture in the West has gone in reinforcing this contempt for those that fight to defend our freedom! If a commanding officer in today's American military shared Patton's fire and unabashed cultural conservatism, would he have even made itto the rank of general?<br />In short, PATTON is an inspiring film about individualism in an age of increasing collectivism. In the famous Stars and Stripes scene, Patton says that \\"Americans will not tolerate a loser.\\" Unfortuanately, Americans that adopt the political correctness of the 21st century are also becoming increasingly intolerant of the individual. But then again, Patton also made it clear that he was only talking about \\"real Americans.\\"
B00000J7J7|4.0|I was entirely unawae of this disc until very recently. I stumbled upon it on Amazon. I love piano music ..... be it jazz, classical or whatever. Having heard Brad's wonderful interpertation of Nick Drakes 'Time has told me' I thought that this disc might prove to be quite an intriguing foray into the area of reflective/solo piano  <BR>work. Well, I was quite right. The music presented here is extremely reflective offering one the possiblity of a bit of a journey into one's inner soul. I can hardly wait to listen to it on an autumn afternoon. Brad's playing and soul searching compares quite favourably with Mingus' 'Improvisations for Piano' , a disc that I save for the most special of moments. You are in good company ..... Brad.
0553208845|5.0|I am a Buddhist from Thailand and I've read this novel countless of times (since 1996). It was one of my early encounters with western writing about Buddhism and ancient indian religions. It is still my favorite book but my view about it has changed over the years. When I read it for the first time, I thought it to be a very profound book. The core premise of the book is that Siddhartha met the Buddha but did not become his follower because he \\"distrust something in the teaching.\\" Siddhartha thought that Buddha teaches about denouncing love which he could not accept and he also distrust that the Buddha's teaching could actually make someone become the \\"enlightened\\" a state which he believed to be Buddha's own exclusive experience.<br /><br />After analyzing this core premise, I am now more certain that Siddhartha is a product of western knowledge of Buddhism in the ninteenth century. In 19th Cent, most famous European thinkers such as Schopenhauer and Nietzsche all revolted against Buddhism which they accused of teaching nihilism (many westerners still do). I think Hesse was influenced by this attitude in the German philosophical scene of the time. In the book, near the end, Siddhartha told Govinda that he could not love words or idea but he could love \\"things\\" - which greatly puzzled Govinda. I think Hesse goes against the very grain of Buddhism which teaches us to be attentive to the impermanence of all sankara (thing/body). Perhaps Hesse wanted to reconcile the idea of love in christianity and Buddhism. Or maybe he just wanted to use Govinda as a representation of the western mind that tend to fixate on ideas and thoughts -whereas Siddhartha was freed from the trap of philosophical dialogues. Or perhaps Hesse view Buddhism as a branch of Eastern philosophy - just as his many contemporaries do. Hesse tended to distrust and despise the scholastic and philosophical studies - especially by academics - as he displayed in \\"The Glass-bead Game,\\" his other major work. He perhaps rejected Buddhism as a philosophical plaything of the thinker-type and suggested that the path to enlightenment must be detached from the difficult teachings. All of these seem to suggest to me that Hesse was fundamentally a product of his time.<br /><br />As for Siddhartha's preoccupation on the individual experience of enlightenment. I suspected that this was the influence of Mahayana Buddhism in the west. According to Theravada tradition, Buddha successfully created thousands of arahants (or enlightened persons) out of his disciples during his life time. This is something Mahayana or Zen traditions could not really accept. They claim that only a handful of monks who had become enlightened at the time of Buddha's death. This is, after all, how they create the rightful lineage for dharmma transmission for their respective denomination. I will not go to discuss about whether who is right or wrong. But I would say that Hesse did not fancy the idea that thousands of individual could attain Nirvana by the teaching of Buddha. Hence, he portrays Govinda as a tired old monk - disappointed that after decade of faithful diligence, he still could not attain the ultimate peace and had met no one who had either, apart from the Illustrious One himself. As a Buddhist I find this rather amusing, as it dismisses most of the merits of Buddha's own teaching - emphasizing a rather zen-like enlightenment which Govinda experience at the end. Not very long ago, I read Bhikkhu Bodhi's, an American Theravada monk, comment on the idea of Bodhisattava, saying that:<br /><br />\\"if there were no arhats, there could be no Buddhas. Because what is the task of a Buddha? A Buddha is one who aspires to achieve Buddhahood in order to liberate many, many sentient beings. And those beings who are liberated by the Buddha are liberated by attaining arhatship. If nobody followed the Buddha's instructions and attained arhatship, then the Buddha could not be a Buddha. He would just be teaching pointlessly.\\"<br /><br />That's pretty much about it. In the end, Siddhartha may be just a creation of a western mind as embodied by the eponymous character who sought enlightenment but rejected the Buddha's teaching - walking away from it and tried to find his own path. Maybe Hesse's aim is to secretly reject Buddhism in favor of a more contemporary Indian's philosophy. It is still a very good book. But if you are a Buddhist, you cannot just say that Enlightenment is real but Buddha's teaching is pointless, I can find my own path. Otherwise, there is simply no need for the Buddha or his religion.intlessly.\\"<br /><br />That's pretty much about it.

0767818040|5.0|Controversial movies like this always result in a lot of contradictory feedbacks. After reading all other viewers' comments, I just want to add a few things. 1. If you label this movie as a \\"porn\\" or \\"soft porn\\", you may never have watched a \\"real\\" porn flick, or you must have missed one topnotch line in the \\"porn film shooting\\" scene of this movie, a line that defined so well the difference between erotic and pornographic cinema (a crew member asked the director, \\"so where's the come shot? I thought we were doing \\"Body Talk\\", not \\"Last Tango\\".)  2. It's quite unfair to blame Brian de Palma for \\"borrowing\\" Hitchcock's ideas from \\"Vertigo\\" or \\"Rear Window\\". Because if that's true, Hitchcock would have been pleased to see his ideas beautifully revived and enhanced in this very entertaining thriller. Over the years, I personally don't find all Hitchcock films as enjoyable as they used to be, while some of Brian de Palma tend to become classics themselves. There's something to make me think of Hitchcock though: Twenty-one years after Tippi Hedren gave a pretty nice performance in \\"The Birds\\" (1963), her daughter Melanie Griffith really delivered a much better one in \\"Body Double\\" (1984).
0312243022|4.0|Since the fall of 2001, I have been reading my way through the Pulitzer Prize winning novels and so far this is the best of the lot.  At the end of chapter 3, which are short, I was a little confused but stick with it.  Certainly provides some insights and food for thought.  Not however for someone who is suffering from depression !
B000002J1L|5.0|\\"The Knife,\\" the last song on Genesis' second album \\"Trespass,\\" was perhaps the only clue of what Genesis could become in terms of musical power and clarity of purpose.  Shortly after that album, the group's drummer left or was otherwise jettisoned, and guitarist Ant Phillips developed stage fright and also departed.  The group acquired drummer Phil Collins and rehearsed/toured for six months without a guitarist (some of the music from that period appears in the Archives Vol. 1 album).  They picked up guitarist Steve Hackett from an ad he had placed, and the \\"classic\\" Genesis lineup was in place.<br />\\"Nursery Cryme\\" was Genesis turbocharged.  Tony Banks on keyboards and Mike Rutherford on bass were developing into players that would rank amongst the best in the prog rock genre, and in fact in all of rock.  Peter Gabriel's singing improved here, too, in confidence and dynamic range (listen to the initial song \\"The Musical Box\\").  However, it is the addition of Collins and Hackett that makes all the difference.  Collins was a propulsive drummer who could keep up with, and in some instances dictate, the drive of the uptempo numbers, such as \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\" and \\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed.\\"  Perhaps the biggest impact is Hackett's guitar: it challenges Bank's organ as the lead instrument of the group.  It seems that Hackett can do anything with an electric guitar, and a lot of stuff acoustically, too.  Of the Genesis albums Hackett was on, he plays the most straightforward rock guitar on this one. Thus, in some places it \\"rocks\\" harder than some other Genesis albums.  However, the best songs, IMHO, are the non-rockers, which are shorter, but are beautifully constructed musically and lyrically.  \\"Seven Stones\\" reflects upon the vagaries of fate, with a great mellotron tag at the end; \\"Harold The Barrel\\" is morose Genesis humor about a man contemplating jumping off a ledge; \\"Harlequin\\" is an acoustic delight.  To use a baseball analolgy, it was as if Genesis was in A ball one minute and made the major leagues with this album.  Yes' album \\"Fragile\\" came out in 1971, also, and while it may be stretching it to compare both in terms of level of musicianship, IMHO these were the two best prog rock albums of that year.  Of course, one group was much more well known . . . then.<br />BTW, if anyone tells you that Collins' singing debut is on \\"More Fool Me\\" on the \\"Selling England By The Pound\\" album, listen to \\"For Absent Friends\\" on this album (and don't think all rockers believe that senior citizens are not good subjects for observation).
0790743507|5.0|This is a film that pleases on all levels.  The script done by Adolph Green and Betty Comden never lets down, with the pacing persisting at a high level throughout, the song and dance activity is unceasingly stellar, and the satirical comedy is fascinating.<br />Satire is one of the toughest forms of entertainment to produce at a workable level, and \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" shines as a satirical classic documenting the important pivotal period when silents gave way to talkies.  Gene Kelly, who co-directed with Stanley Donen, plays silent star Don Lockwood while vivacious Debbie Reynolds is sweet and determined Kathy Selden, who hopes to break into movies.  Quick-witted, fast-moving Donald O'Connor plays Cosmo Brown, film pianist and longtime friend of Kelly's.<br />Monumental Studio head Millard Mitchell, said to be a spoofy characterization of MGM musical producing giant, Arthur Freed,the producer of \\"Singin' in the Rain,\\" is in a jam when caught during the critical interim period after Al Jolson's big success in the first film talkie, \\"The Jazz Singer.\\"  Mitchell has a prospective talkie turkey that preview audiences hated with a passion.  The quick thinking of Donald O'Connor results in a game plan to turn the turkey into a success before its release.<br />The reason the film is a prospective bomb is due to Kelly's co-star, played with perfect comedic timing by Jean Hagen, well known to many as Danny Thomas' television wife in the hit series of the fifties, \\"Make Room for Daddy.\\"  Hagen's high-pitched, squeaky voice is totally ill-suited to the new medium.  A valiant effort by a voice coach leaves her admitting abject defeat, unable to accomplish the impossible.  The new spin is to have newcomer Reynolds, who has a pleasant speaking and singing voice, dub for the impossible Hagen, whose ego and nastiness are in direct proportion to her absence of talent.  Her Sadie Hawkins pursuit of Kelly is spurned.  Knowing that he loves Reynolds increases Hagen's resentment toward Reynolds.<br />The film reaches a stirring conclusion as Hagen vindictively attempts to hold studio boss Mitchell captive and make a continuing slave of Reynolds, using her as an unseen and lowly paid force who saves Hagen's career.  The fast thinking of Kelly results in a plan carried out in concert with Mitchell and O'Connor, bringing the film to a rousing climax.<br />The classic \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" scene highlighting Kelly's magnificent dancing was a true case of \\"The show must go on.\\"  It was shot on a hot, sultry summer day when the star was suffering with a temperature of better than one hundred degrees.  Another standout musical number is the \\"Broadway Melody\\" sequence featuring the dancing of leggy, incredibly sexy Cyd Charisse, who would later star with Kelly in \\"Brigadoon.\\"  Other solid numbers are \\"You Are My Lucky Star\\" and \\"You Were Meant For Me.\\"
0881030376|4.0|George is smart and intellgent. Lennie is a man like a giant, but has a mind of child. Both of them have nothing in common, but they are best friends. Wherever George goes, Lennie follows. Lennie is always in trouble and George will have to clean up the mass. Together they have a dream for their future, but Lennie gets in trouble again that may stop them from succeeding their dream. I like this book very much, because I learn how important friendships are and that people can never predict what will happen in life. I will recommend this book to my friends, because I want them to know how important friendships are and how love can change people's lives.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Probably the funniest movie I've ever seen without going to the point of absurdity, Clerks remains Kevin Smith's all time classic.  The story focuses around conveinience store clerks Dante and Randal (played by Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson respectively) and their misadventures during one day at work.  Clerks also introduced us to Jay and Silent Bob (played by Jason Mewes and Smith respectively).  I've worked in a conveinience store for over a year, so I know how Dante and Randal feel about working, and thats what halped made Clerks great.  What made Clerks work on so many levels though was the quick, snappy dialogue between the characters, and with some memorable lines (37...) and some disturbingly funny scenes (what happens to Dante's ex...) made Clerks an all time low budget classic.  The DVD special additions are worth noting, the Soul Asylum video is cool, and the alternate ending is good too, and after watching it I can see why Smith cut it (having the movie end with the alternate ending would have ruined Clerks entirely), and all in all this is a good buy.
0790734060|5.0|I've heard it a million times. This film is not supposed to be taken as a biography, so what? It's wonderful entertainment. We connect so with all the cast you feel their pain and joy throughout this amazing drama. On one hand we have the person we all are, Antonio Salieri. Mediocre, but surviving, wishing he had great talent. He obeys his bosses and puts up with their faults.  He also feels emotions of love for a woman but never expresses it. Then he meets Hulce's Mozart and a great jealousy takes over him, infuriating him to the point of madness. We've all been this way.<br />Then there's the person we wish we could be. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Not only is he brilliant, but he's unafraid to do anything. Where Salieri obeyed and respected authority, Wolfie chastises and contradicts it. We've all wanted to do this at some point I'm sure. Wolfie is in love with life, and he embraces it in it's fullest. Having affairs with well-endowed opera stars, getting rip roarin' drunk, and attending party after party even when he can't afford it. In addition, he is delighted, amused, but to a certain degree also tortured by the beauty he creates. Truly, Mozart is a man we can see ourselves in easily.<br />Then we have the mediator in form of Constanze. In the beginning she starts out much like Wolfgang, happy and carefree. But as things go on, after they have a family and she's ready to settle down she becomes much more strict and money-wise. She acts to Wolfgang like his father, and it seems towards the end money becomes her ultimate goal instead of happiness. We also, can see ourselves in this position.<br />Several other characters strike a chord with us. Even as old Salieri proclaims that God is not to be trusted, we can hear our own doubts in that line. Overall, this is an amazing film filled with every human emotion. It can and does create a greater understanding and appreciation of the incredible Wolfgang Amadeus.<br />In closing, I'd like to add that Mozart had basically three parts to himself that are shown wonderfully in this picture. Wolfie the child, the one Salieri sees and hates, Amadeus the lover, the one Constanze falls for, and Mozart the composer, the one the world as fallen in love with. Hopefully Wolfie Amadeus Mozart will now be known for who he truly was, a man to genius for his time, and too immature for his place.y three parts to himself that are shown wonderfully in this picture.

B000059XUO|5.0|I have loved this movie since it came out.  It, and Tim Burton's first Batman, are the two greatest comic book film adaptations in existence.  The dark, grungy soundtrack is a perfect fit for The Crow's shady, rainy, dreary world.  This is a must-watch movie, and I would highly recommend buying the soundtrack too.  <br />The Collector's Edition DVD is a great addition to anyone's media library, even if they already have the old DVD.  I was expecting the Collector's Edition to be, like most other DVD Collector's Editions, packed full of worthless extras that I wouldn't watch more than once.  However, this movie is one of the few to actually give justification for paying extra for the bonus material.  The commentaries are good.  The deleted scenes are mildly interesting, but nothing I would watch a second time.  The concept art for the posters is worth a look.  <br />The real gem in this collection, and the thing that justifies the entire purchase, is the profile of James O'Barr, the odd creator of one of the greatest comics of all time.  The interview gives an interesting  history of the man's life and sheds light on his reasons for creating The Crow.  His story is as tragic and beautiful as the fictional story in his comic.  Definitely give it a look.
0553213105|5.0|An amazing book! I thought this was one of those &quot;girly-girl&quot; books that was mushy and stupid. Yet this isn't some Harlequin romance. In fact, it pertains equally to both genders. Elizabeth Bennet, Mr. Darcy, the characters are amazingly created by Jane Austen. A wonderful book, definitely worth the time and effort spent trying to understand it.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I wish there was an option for 0 STARS, because that is what I felt after watching this movie. The acting is great, but the story is sorry. I want to understand a movie when I see it, not be so confused after viewing it that I can't sleep. Stupid. I don't see why this is called one of the best movies of 2001. In my opinion, it's one of the worst of ALL TIME. The story was thrown in an even more confusing way when the leading ladies made lesbian love. One of the most degrating things I have ever seen. It was also thrown in a confusing way when the two leading actresses here were [pulled] into a box and they were in the same time period as two different people, but they were the same women. STUPIDNESS! I MADE myself keep watching this film because it was given so many good reviews. After viewing this I have to wonder, was David Lynch on drugs when making this??? It is very questionable. And I think anyone to make a stupid, pointless movie like this HAS to be on some kind of drugs.
B00000294R|5.0|First I just wanna say that Big L is one of favorite artists, if not my favorite. He is the illest lyricist of all time. No other MC even comes close. Sure there are some who are acknowledged as tight lyricists (Biggie, Nas, etc.) but Big L is just he best. In this debut album, he displays his unique style.              1)Put it On-This was the first single from this album. Big L's style was too good for the commercial public. It was too complex. <BR>2)M.V.P-Awesome beat supplied by Lord Finesse. This song is really catchy. <BR>3)No Endz, No Skinz-I think this track has the best beat on the cd. I wish they would play this on the radio. If you requested it, they would be like, What?<BR>4)8 Iz Enuff-This is a cool song featuring 7 other people, a couple of them being Cam'ron and Herb McGruff.<BR>5)All Black-Like all songs on the cd, Big L shows amazing wordplay like: \\"Yo ever since I was young, I ripped mics and I killed beats<BR>...<br />6)Danger Zone-Big L rappin about his hometown, 139 & Lenox, Harlem.<BR>7)Street Struck-A darker beat on this song, some people be hatin on this song, but it still awesoem.<BR>8)Da Graveyard-A hot song featuring some MCs like Lord Finesse and a young and hungry Jigga.<BR>9)Lifestylez Ov Da Poor and Dangerous-It was a shame Big L got killed, there's no telling what he could've done if he would've of signed with Roc-a-Fella, but in a way I'm glad, he didn't because he might've sold out.<BR>10)I Don't Understand It-In this song Big L is rappin about how rappers who don't have any talent go platinum, while MCs with real talent don't even go gold.<BR>11)Fed Up With The ...-Big L rapped about dark things, but his skill was undeniable. No one talks about him when they talk about deceased rappers. No disrespect to Biggie or Pac, but just because L didn't sell millions of records didn't make him any less skillfull.<BR>12)Let Em Have It \\"L\\"-Catchy as ... Big L is the least boring artist of all time. He could rap to any beat, and you could stilllisten. Some of these rappers out right now are boring even with beats by top beat makers.<BR>         The only downfall about this album is the few amount of songs, but everyone is great. So if someone else had 20 some songs on their album, but only 5 of them are bangin, why waste space. So R.I.P Big L, and you must buy this album if you are a fan of hip-hop.
B00003CXZ4|2.0|Everyones Been Giving This movie all this praise that it sets a groundbreaking level for movies now. The truth is that the director made this movie solely for the fact to say &quot;Im smarter than all of you, so im going to make a movie that none of you can understand so ill look like the genius&quot;<BR>And Another Thing, the reason this movie won so many awards makes sense because if you think about it, the average movie critic sees over 1000 movies each year.  He sees a lot of action, comedy, thrillers, and romantic movies. But the movie critic can eventually get tired of the same old thing, so movie critics are always looking for that 1 different movie each year to give the award to<BR>This movie was terrible dont go see it
B00005T33W|4.0|Terry Zwigoff's \\"Ghost World\\" is that rarest of hybrids -- a human comedy, brilliantly and bizarrely funny, but suffused with a profound sense of melancholia. The experience of watching it is deliriously pleasurable, but the humor emerges from the film's unfailingly generous reservoir of empathy; by the end, you're not sure whether to respond to these characters with laughter or with love. It is quite clear that Zwigoff feels both.<br />And that's what critics of this fine film have overlooked -- that although 17-year-old Enid (Thora Birch) looks at the world with bitter, unremittingly sarcastic eyes, \\"Ghost World\\" couldn't be less cynical or judgmental if it tried. Of all the characters on display, most of whom Enid despises and ridicules, there isn't a single one who isn't really good at heart; even the art teacher (a ridiculously funny Illeana Douglas), who has been derided as a one-dimensional caricature, has an untouchable core of decency.<br />Indeed, the character for whom \\"Ghost World\\" retains the harshest criticism is Enid herself. As much as we adore her terrifying intelligence, her single-mindedly retro fashion sense, and her contempt for all things phony and pretentious, we aren't allowed to forget her self-destructive habits or her unwillingness to grow up even as the world around her charges resolutely forward. Her best friend, Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), once her partner in crime, has taken on a normalcy and sense of perspective that Enid finds tiresome, which is partly why she takes refuge in a lonely middle-aged bachelor named Seymour (Steve Buscemi, in a shoulda-been-Oscar-nominated performance). Their bond is at once improbable and emotionally convincing, and Zwigoff harmonizes Birch's and Buscemi's own highly idiosyncratic styles into a marvelous, unforced chemistry.<br />Compassionate and subtly optimistic, \\"Ghost World\\" only falters slightly with a few misfired pop-culture references and an ending that's both ambiguous and too overstated, buteven that misstep proves strangely satisfying. With a character as unforgettable as Enid, it's good to know that there's such a thing as closure -- even if it's open-ended closure.
B00000IPAX|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this album. On one hand, this is the album where the once adequate Blink 182 began to turn pop. On the other hand, the album has only 3 or 4 songs that are disgustingly pop-y. The rest of the album is pretty good. This album is a perfect middle ground between &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; and &quot;Take off your pants and jacket&quot;. For those who don't like their pop-punk too hardcore, the songs are easier on the ears than &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; and &quot;Chesire Cat&quot;. But, as the band didn't completely sell out on this album, it still has some well-written and fast paced songs. For those who started their pop-punk odyssey with &quot;Take off your Pants and Jacket&quot;, this album will easily introduce you to MUCH better music. If you really liked &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, and honestly, everyone should, you'll probably like the less pop-y moments of this album. Remember, if your going from one album to the other, listen to this one first, don't make the jump without it. The album has a fair number of good songs, especially &quot;Aliens exist&quot;, &quot;Dumpweed&quot;, and &quot;Anthem&quot;. If your looking for the pop, look no further than &quot;What's my age again?&quot;, &quot;Adam's Song&quot;, and, in my opinion, the worst song ever written, &quot;All the Small Things&quot;. Geez, what would Blink 182 be like if they'd never released that god-forsaken song. I think the world would be a better place.
B00003CXIP|5.0|This is the kind of movie that you can watch with your family and everyone will enjoy it.  I found this to be a great movie, a tale of coming of age, and enjoying an adventure with your friends.  This is the type of movie that you cna watch over and over again, and never get tierd of.  I recomend this movie highly for everyone and there family!
B00005J9U1|5.0|You cannot sum up how great this cd is in one word. It can be done in a few more words, though: The Best Reggae CD of All Time.<br />Bob Marley, the best reggae singer of all time, has his greatest songs on this one cd. It starts off by setting the mood with the soothing \\"Stir It Up\\", and continues with that mood. Next is \\"Get Up, Stand Up,\\" which is a wonderful song with an appearance by Peter Tosh. It then goes into \\"I shot the Sheriff,\\" which any person can like, with it's upbeat tempo. Then \\"Lively Up Yourself,\\" which is one of his first hits. Then it goes into a live recording of \\"No Woman No Cry,\\" which is great hearing it live. At the beginning of it, you can hear the cround singing, \\"No Woman No Cry...\\"<BR>       <BR>Then, it becomes more upbeat. \\"Roots, Rocks, Reggae\\" leads into his biggest hit, \\"Jamming.\\" \\"Exodus\\" and \\"Buffalo Soldier\\" are very upbeat, which leads into the even-more upbeat \\"Iron Lion Zion\\". The Album is completed with \\"I know a Place,\\" a song that was recorded in 1977 and is cannot be found on any other Bob Marley album.<BR>     <BR>This has to be the greatest reggae album of all time. I know I'm being redundant, but it is true. The album has nice, slow songs, and upbeat dance songs. If you like reggae, this album is an essential to your collection.
B00005JL9A|4.0|Recently i hired out a copy of Battle Royal on dvd and considering that it was the first film i have fully watched with subtitles i was extremely surprised. I am a media student and havr a keen interest in all films and i have to say that i havent seen such a good film for years/ i am a keen fan of films that came out of the eighties and only a few modern films have been able to reach the calibar of this genre. Flms such as \\"The Matrix\\" & \\"Fight Club\\" gave me hope that there was still auteurs out there that had the vision of a good film and not just the money involved or the publisity that came along with it but genuienly had good ideas and gambled with this to pruduce films that are at least to say out standing. BR is the lateset film that has the taste of Kubrick and the keen control of lynch and manges to pull off the greatest film of the century through its characterization and origanal plot.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I'm 16, and the CD I listen to the most is this soundtrack. It's so versatile. I could listen to it all the time. I didn't want to see the movie at first, but after seeing it once I couldn't get enough. I bought Tolkien's book and saw it four more times after that, and have listened to the soundtrack more times than I can count. It may sound obsessive but it's true. I never get tired of it. It's so...indescribable.

B00005V9HH|5.0|Absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time! Almost perfect mystery puzzle to solve. &quot;Who is Keyzer Soze?&quot; Excellent job by Kevin Spacey who won Best Supporting Actor for his role. Very interesting from start to finish. The ending of this film astonished me enough to watch this whole movie again and again and again. Destined to be a Masterpiece and should without no doubt be entered into the Hall of Fame of film making. A superb film with famous catchy phrases. I personally use this film to judge all others for creativity, dialogue, direction, cleverness, and acting.  Very well thought out and directed. Great visuals and additions of scenes to make your imagination go wild.  One of the best if not the best endings to any film available.  If you have not seen this, I recommend you choose this first over anything else.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|I thought this would be a copy of Indiana Jones. I never liked indiana jones, just to tell yah! This was nothing like it! It was good, fun and family entertainment! Okay, at parts, it was a little fantasy, well, it is! But, you know! It's from a game, what else can yah ask for! This was one of my favourites in 2001(along with The Wedding Planner and Domestic Disturbance). Well, her name Lara Croft(Jolie). She's a tough, sexy tomb raider. She' great! Her helpers are not as good as her, but good enough to keep you going! Especially Jon Voigt! She goes in ancient times and battles all these creatures, it's fun! I don't like all those creatures and things, trust me, but this was good! Definetely recommended!
B00005RYQO|5.0|The Fast and the Furious is a movie about a rookie cop,(Paul Walker) who poses as an LA street racer in order to uncover who is behind a string of truck hijackings occuring in the area.

Theres only one problem-when his time there is up, hes not sure hes ready to go back! <br />The movie cast is amazing and plays their role very convincingly. As you watch the movie you feel as if you are a part of it, like you are right there. I was constantly one the edge of my seat the whole movie, and i found myself watching it again and again and again. <BR>This movie combines the story of a group of racers growing up in the suburbs, with knowledge of cars and racing in general. THis is a movie that will quickly become one of your favorites!
B000003KMM|5.0|When i first saw \\"Major League\\" I had to see it again, it was that good.  I mean the storyline is kinda predictable, but it's still a great movie.  The characters make the movie so funny.  Each one has something very funny about them.  The one person who i thought was the funniest was WILLIE MAYS HAYS.  He will crack you up again and again.  The movie shows the funnier and lighter side of baseball, while keeping the focus on the importance of baseball.  Get this movie and enjoy it.  If you're a baseball fan don't take it too seriously.  It's just a movie
B0000067L2|4.0|This is a great LP and would have to give it 4 stars out of 5 only because there is this OTHER one out there recored previous to this featureing EC. THe groundbreaking LP Recorded with John Mayall by far tops this for Clapton guitar playing. Its no wonder that LP was the one that broke ground for the rock guitar sound. even to this day..listen to that one and you will know what i am talking about. He plays much cleaner with a nice tight sound on the Bluesbreakers LP more so than in Cream days. JTM 45 Marshall Amp was one big reason for the great sound i believe.<BR> Bluesbreakers also is the first time Claptons voice was recorded.  This sounds more like a review of Bluebreakers LP than Cream..Thats because Its better than this one.. still this is a good example of Clapton at his second best in Desraeli Gears

0393307050|4.0|One begins Master and Commander with some trepidation -- it being the first chapter of an intensely beloved twenty volume series. Fortunately, the opening scenes depicting the first meeting of O'Brians's long running protagonists are funny and engaging. It is only thereafter that the book becomes a challenging read.<br />There is a little in the way of an overarching narrative; Master and Commander serves as more of an introduction to life on a Napoleonic brig, and to Aubrey and Maturin. But the book's real difficulty lies in its absolute immersion in its era. It makes no concession to a modern reader lacking knowledge of the period, the setting, or how to rig a frigate. This makes the book a sometimes tough read -- but is also why it is ultimately so rewarding.<br />One close's Master and Commander with the sense of having spent time with very particular people in a very particular time, looking forward to doing so again in the next volume.
0783242808|1.0|First of all, let me say that I'm not a prude, not a religious fanatic, not easily offended, and not lacking in a sense of humor. I also have an open mind and I'm not even averse to crude humor, a la South Park and Beavis and Butthead. So no one can blame my dislike of this movie on priggishness.<br />Put plain and simply, I found this movie unfunny. The best it managed to get from me was a couple of snickers, but that's it. I spent most of the movie wondering when it was going to start being funny, then turned it off in disgust after the internet exploitation scene. Even if I had liked the Jason Biggs character, that scene would've destroyed any liking I had. Sorry, but webcasting a young woman without her knowledge or consent isn't funny, nor is it something a decent, likeable person would do. If that scene had been omitted, I might not have hated this movie nearly as much.<br />The sad thing is, the movie might actually have had some potential in the right hands. As I've already said, I don't normally have a problem with crude humor; however, I do want my crude humor to be well done. The difference between this movie and something like, say, South Park is that South Park's humor is done with wit and charm. American Pie tried to have some charm, but the aforementioned internet scene gutted any heart it may have had. And as for wit...the gags here were so obvious the writers may as well have dropped anvils on the audience's head.<br />In the movie's favor, though, there was one surprise: the casting of Mena Suvari against type. Rather than have her play a beautiful, seductive type as might be expected, whoever did the casting gave her the role of a normal and likeable girl...although an extremely pretty one. That's really the only reason I'm not bellyaching that we can't rate a movie with negative stars.
B000003C2S|5.0|This is a classic death metal album. A bit slower and heavier than the brilliant \\"Leprosy\\" CD which preceded it, \\"Spiritual Healing\\" is a must have for those of us who enjoy heavy music. This CD also has possibly the best lyrics of any death metal album; a huge progression from the blood-and-guts nonsense of \\"Scream Bloody Gore\\". Sadly, this classic album is now difficult to find.

The story sears, the special effects stake out new moviemaking territory - the movie flat - out rocks.
B00000373U|5.0|i'm been listening to elliott for some time now...you can even call me an elliott smith junkie. it's true...i know it's bad for me, but i can't get enough of it. it'd be snowing hardcore and i would look out my window for hours listening to him...and this cd feels like the sound-track of my winter days. this cd made me pick up the guitar...and the only songs i know how to play and sing are elliott songs...i just wish that i heard of him earlier so i could catch one of his acoustic shows. i saw him a couple of years ago in detroit playing at st. andrews and he was good, but rumor has it that his acoustic shows are a totally different experience. really wish that he would start doing that again. enough sappy stuff...this cd is amazing. buy it. borrow it. listen to it. become an elliott junkie like me. this cd makes cronic depression cool.
B000003C5C|5.0|This is a must have for anyone into speed/death metal. When this album was released it received some scathing reviews from journalists who had never heard anything heavier than Bon Jovi or Motley Crue, but those of us who enjoy true heavy metal fell in love with it. Unfortunately Rick Rozz left Death shortly after \\"Leprosy\\" was released, so this was the only Schuldiner/Rozz collaboration; that is a shame, because heavy metal doesn't get any better than this.
B00000IQC8|2.0|The worst of the five movies to date.  I found this pretty boring in the fact that nothing much happens.  Even though I find the end to 'Chasing Amy' unsatisfactory, the original ending to this might have helped me in ensuring that this pap can never have a sequel.<br />Let's face it folks nothing happens.  Thank God Jay and Bob are in this to alleviate the lags of action.<br />Key follow up question.  Does everyone in the US smoke?  All they seem to want to do are buy cigarettes...<br />I'm sure that people can read any amount of subliminal psycho-analytical mumbo-jumbo into this, but hey, after university, I occasionally want to sit down and enjoy something which leads somewhere without having to go into theorising over juxtaposition, and the passage from light to lucidity.<br />From all tragedy springs humour, in this case, only a minor yawn can be engendered.<br />Start the series with Mallrats, and avoid this one.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This is a flawed movie that has enough moments of brilliance in it to carry you through the rest. All of the actors are fantastic in their roles (although some of the charicatures in the film remain just that, despite the good acting). Especiialy Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is brilliant -- taking up the role of a schizophrenic Holden Caulfield-type character perfectly. The story is intriguing. The directing and cinematography, brilliant.<br />This is a movie with great emotional punch, but which fails to come together logically in the end. It's a time-travel story with holes in it, and although the holes in logic are filled with touching, emotional moments, the holes in logic are still present. <br />Still, despite the logic-problems, I give it four stars because it has so many moments in it that I can personally relate to. I think anyone who remembers the confusion, ackwardness and frustration of being an adolescent should see this movie, because, truth is, Jake Gyllenhaal brings Donnie Darko to life in the moments when he seems most sane -- when he seems like a kid too smart for his own good, unsure how to deal with a world that isn't the way he would have made it, if he were in charge.<br />If you watch this movie and you remember those ackward adolescent moments you experienced when growing up, you'll find something in Donnie's character to which you can relate. And something in the story that touches you, in one way or other.
B000002B2T|5.0|As you know Layne Staley's body was found on friday the 19th of April, and I thought I'd review this album to show what his music and lyrics mean to me.<br />Layne had just gotten out of rebhab, and went into the recording studio and wrote this album along with fellow Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready.  The lyrics ,while still gloomy, reflect Layne's optimism regarding the future, after all he had just beaten alcohol, so he had some hope in him yet.  This album is probably Dirt's more laid back slow bluesy brother.  This album is sort of like the music that is played in some old empty club in the middle of nowhere, songs to drink to and to cry to.  The songs are deep though, for example Long gone day, dealing with a summer that Layne wished would never end: \\"...the music that we made, the wind has carried all of that away\\".  <br />It's easy to relate to this album, whether you are lonely or down or just feel like you are lost in the world.  It's ironic that Layne died the way he did, all alone, without a friend in the world.  No one had heard from him in years.  Songs like Wake Up whith Layne singing: \\"For 10 long years, the leaves to rake, slow suicide's no way to go..\\" and the last part: \\"for all the times you let them bleed you,for little peace from God you plead\\", seemed to have lost their original message after his death, due to a Heroin overdose.  <br />We all felt like we knew Layne, because his lyrics were so open and emotional, he shared a part of himself with us through his lyrics.  Layne, wherever you are, I want to thank you and as I sit here listening to this record, I want you to know that you weren't alone, we all thought about you during these long hard years.
0446310786|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" is a tale of the life of a young girl and her brother. It is told from the first person point of view of Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch. She tells of what she and her brother Jeremy \\"Jem\\" Finch experience during the early 1900's when prejudice against African Americans, as well as other groups, is a common occurrence.<BR>Scout and Jem are the children of a single father Atticus Finch. Atticus is a lawyer and believes in being completely honest to everyone about everything especially his children. Even though Jem does not go to his father for advice and guidance as much as Scout does, most of his actions however; are actions that his father would approve of especially as he gets older. I sometimes thought of him as a of father figure type for Scout, especially while their father was in court defending a black man who was on trial for the rape of a white woman. As a reader I could see one very strong similarity between Jem and his father. They can both be very stubborn and they both stand up for what they believe in.<BR>Scout tells us how she learns about justice, racism, compassion, trust and love. Scout learns about justice, racism, and how sometimes the wrong person gets punished for a crime just because of their race when she, her brother and their friend Dill witness the trial of Tom Robinson. She learns to be compassionate of \\"Boo\\" Radley's feelings and decides that she will befriend the recluse and act as if they had always known each other. She learns to trust the good judgment of her elders (especially her aunt Alexandria) and comes to love each of them because they have been there to provide her with clear answers to everything that happens in their neighborhood. <BR>By telling a story like this from the point of view of an innocent child, Harper Lee truly captures the readers attention and I think that is what makes this novel so great.<BR>I highly recommend this book. Once I started reading it I didn't want to put it down.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|I bought this based on the reviews you have read below mine.  What a disappointment.<br />Convoluted and complex, it leaves the viewer confused and dissatisfied.  What is the point of the phone number on his arm, what does Drew Barrymore's character add to the story?  Maybe I am missing the finer points of the intricate plotline, but then again, the key feeling I felt at the end was one of apathy...  I did not particularly care.<br />The ending is obvious, and not a surprise.  Granted this is better than Final Destination, but if that is the benchmark, then we can all find better things to do in 'approximately 98 minutes.'<br />One to watch if you must... not buy.  Avoid, unless you are an undying fan of 'Sixth Sense' in which case I would redirect you to the black and white classic, 'Dead of Night' which is infinitely superior to this.
B00004RHZU|1.0|this is not a good cd.  dont buy it it is really bad.  instead you should biy Pink' new album Missundatzood.<BR>Do Not buy Cant Take Me Home
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road, so aptly named after the road where the Fab Four recorded most of their music since 1962, is a fluidly sonic masterpiece, using all their experiences and knowledge gathered since their first release 'Love Me Do' to devastating effect.<br />Each member contributes positively to the album, leaving us with a lasting memory of what made them the immortal Pop/Rock Band idiom.<br />The first song 'Come Together', with one of the classic bass lines kicks off a strong 'singles' line up on Side 1. Other notable recordings include 'Something', 'Because' and 'Here Comes The Sun'.<br />Side 2, with it's long medley sequence, evokes a thousand images in a little over 15 minutes of timeless recorded music.<BR>'Golden Slumbers' is a gorgeous lullaby-style passage at the heart of the medley.<br />This album is essential listening, even if you're not a big Beatles fan. So what are you waiting for? :o)
B000060P79|5.0|I thought this cd was really good.  I could relate to this cd.  The lyrics are like Good Charlotte.  My favorite song on this cd was One Day.  It talk about a teenager that feels trapped in his house and how he can't wait to get out.  I think that if you are a teenager you would really relate to this cd.  This is one on my favorite cd's.  I listen to it all the time.  I would recommend this Cd to someone.

B00005BIIP|5.0|Recordings was the first Porcupine Tree album I heard mostly because distribution of their CDs are terrible in the U.S. Since then I've been purchasing what I can find which has been most of their catalog.<br />Having been a recent fan of PT it is difficult to consider Recordings as a B sides, extra tracks kind of CD. As a listener new to Porcupine Tree I was instantly involved with the album as a whole.<br />Buying New Soul is a great opener with great dynamics and mood. Access Denied was a surprise. It sounded like a drugged up XTC number, something different yet sandwiched with Cure For Optimism it made for a nice flow, a buffer between darker sounding songs.<br />The flow of Recordings is a strength. Even though it was recorded on several tracks at different sessions the songs fit well together. Much of this has to do with the vibe of Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun, there is a similarity to these albums much as there is a similarity to the tracks found on Recordings.<br />Even Less in this expanded version is quite engaging, the expansion actually sets up some drama from an already great song.<br />If I were advising someone to buy their first PT album I'd consider suggesting Recordings right along with Signify as these two CDs represent PT in their extended song format along with the shift to more traditional material from the previous two releases.<br />A few thoughts about Porcupine Tree and progressive rock. PT is not typical of what most people are familiar with as prog rock. They use synthesizers and on occasion work with complex song structures but also paint sound more like an electronica or post rock band. In this sense I'd place them as post rock with prog and electronica elements. It is worth consideration as to whether Porcupine Tree aren't developing the first advance in progressive rock instead of depending on 70's based progressive and quoting favorite artists from that era. One thing not mentioned are the extreme dynamics of PT recordings. This is music that demands listener's attention. Some passages are so quiet as to be distracting to casual listening. It could be argued that PT is expanding on the German tradition of electronic music in a similar vein to NEU! Although early PT albums borrowed from Pink Floyd that influence has diminished from Signify onward.<br />In any case Porcupine Tree are evolving into a unique sound that is their own. It could well be the first serious attempt to create the next phase of progressive music. At the very least this is entertaining music that will appeal to forward thinking listeners.
0671024256|5.0|Stephen King is one of the most successful writers alive in America today.  It only makes sense that he can write an excellent book about writing.  If you're at all interested in writing, this is a great book to read.  Buy it!
B00005UQD5|5.0|Man, i ...I saw it in the theatre and i had to hide my eyes more than once.  This is really scary.  I haven't been this creeped out since the Shining.  I won't go into detail explaining it..i'm sure you've all heard..but for real...a definite must see for all.
B000001YOW|5.0|On Signify, Porcupine Tree become a full time band. Previous albums such as The Sky Moves Sideways had elements of the full band and  Steve Wilson working as a solo artist. While that album and previous ones were excellent Signify demonstrates the progression in musical ideas.<br />Starting out with the ambient Bornlivedie and morphing into Signify listeners get a good idea of the evolving sound of Porcupine Tree. There is more drive without losing the ambience that makes PT so interesting. <br />Every Home Is Wired plays the technology issues of the future against PT's own brand of electronica meets progressive rock. Listen to Idiot Prayer, the song prior to Every Home Is Wired. It is a juxtiposition in thematic ideas.<br />This is another area that makes Porcupine Dream such an entertaining band. The subject matter which is mostly bleak to sardonic is a far cry from traditional radio friendly music yet one gets the feeling that with some promotion PT would do well on college and open format radio.<br />The other area that is a major advance is the programming of the album with excellent ebb and flow. At times rocking and alternatively similar to post rock electronic bands the mix of rock and soundscapes progress nicely making Signify a great listen in one sitting.<br />Check out PT's next album, the live Coma Divine, some tracks from Signify are on it but the real interest are the band treatment of older material.  <br />Very much a transitional release, Signify gives some indication of the one two punch of Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun to follow. As a fan I hope Porcupine Tree move back to this territory. Also, this seems to be one of the easier to find PT albums. It's also one of their best.
B00005QENZ|5.0|In his influential 1941 essay &quot;On Popular Music,&quot; Frankfurt School critic Theodor Adorno argues that popular music promotes passive listening.  The strain and boredom of work is such that we want to avoid effort in our leisure time and that popular music satisfies our craving for stimulation after work.  Our choice is between dancing in distraction to the rhythm of the music, oblivious to our own exploitation and oppression, or to wallow in sentimental mistery, again obvlious to the real conditions of our existence.<br />My preference has always been for the former, which explains in part why I really like &quot;Get a Grip.&quot;  Before this 1993 album I could always take or leave Aerosmith, but this particular effort has remained one of my favorites for almost a decade now.  If I om going to ignore by exploitation and oppression, this is the the sort of music I want to be playing (loudly) on my CD player.  I could not tell you half the lyrics of any of these fourteen songs, so my ability to explore the social significance of &quot;Livin' on the Edge&quot; or &quot;Eat the Rich&quot; is pretty much blown.  I just think this is a great rock and roll ablum.  The point is to playing &quot;Cryin'&quot; or &quot;Get A Grip&quot; and turn the volume up real loud.  I heard that Aerosmith was all set to release this album when they decided to go back into the studio and tinker with it a bit more.  I am not musically adept enough to either recognize or explain what they did, but whatever it was it sure works.  There is something majestic about the sound of these songs, which reminds me of the operatic rock sound we first recognized on Alice Cooper's &quot;Billion Dollar Babies&quot; and Meatloaf's &quot;Bat Out of Hell.&quot;  At least for once in their long career, Aerosmith got to the top of the mountain.
B000056IKS|5.0|NEU! created a brilliant work with this their first album. While other electronic acts were focusing on lock step rhythms or psychedelic freakouts NEU! took the formula and twisted it adding guitar to more abstract electronic excursions that would end up being the blueprint for modern electronica and post rock acts like Stereolab and Tortoise. Even somewhat progressive rock bands such as Porcupine Tree were influenced, their cover of Hallogallo is a nice tribute.<br />While Kraftwerk and Tangarene Dream were critally acclaimed and successful examples of dance and abstract electronic music respectively NEU! had elements of both plus a synthesis of rock, eventually pre-dating punk music. Essentially NEU! were one of the first, if not the first to develop remixing which would happen due to budgetary issues on their second album NEU! 2.<br />On this album there are moments of intensity that are dark and scary beside modest electronic soundscapes. <br />The whole concept of adding a rock element to a fundementally electronic basis was unique in it's time and different from progressive rock artists like Yes or Genesis who used electronics to emulate and give impressions of orchestral instruments or how western symphonic arrangements could be made with synthetic timbres.<br />NEU! was always more concerned with timbre (sound) and texture rather than emulation of older forms of music or instruments. Even in the early 70's when they first recorded they were a bit different and more futuristic than electronic based bands from their era. They were also more obscure and less stable as a performing band which probably didn't help them gain their much deserved audience.<br />For a long time their recordings were unavailable. The release of their albums is fortunate. Perhaps now audiences will have a chance to hear their unique synergy of musical sources while gaining a better understanding of the electronica and post rock/experimental scenes that borrowed heavily from NEU!'s sound.
0553210246|5.0|I read this novel in English class, like most people probably did. It was one of the best assigned to us.<br />Hardy is a gifted author. He writes in a clear style with vivid descriptions that really bring the setting alive, without making the reader (at least this reader) feel inundated with borning, unnecessary detail.<br />The thing that I look for most in a novel, however, is quality characterizeations, and this book had them in spades. Dialogue was used effectively to flesh out characters. These are not stock characters, either. These  people have flaws and shades of grey. They seem as though they could be real. I found that I could relate to the characters, and I did empathize with them, even when I didn't agree with their choices. Everyone had clear motivations. The characterization of Henchard shows that Hardy clearly understood the notion of the tragic flaw and the tragic hero/anti hero.<br />Students who have to read this book as part of their English class may find it a bit on the long side. I would urge you to stick with it; once you get through the initial chapters the book will pick up (a commonality that all British classics seem to share). The book is easy to follow and understand. It is a key novel that marks the shift from Romantic Age to the Victorian Age, so it's an important read for anyone who has a serious interest in English Literature.
B000002H72|5.0|I never heard of The Pixies prior to an impulse purchase when Doolittle was a new release. After first listen I wasn't sure what to make of it. In part annoyed, in part drawn by the shear weirdness it took a few spins to fall in love with this album.<br />Their third release, Doolittle brought a glossier mix with their major label debut. Instant classics include Here Comes Your Man and Monkey Gone To Heaven. These were smart, instantly catchy amalgams of surf, punk and power pop.<br />At the time the soft-loud mixture was fairly unique and borrowed frequently by many popular alternative artists today. But what made The Pixies so unique were the lyrical topics, over the top humor and wild swings in Black Francis' vocals. Listen to Debaser or Wave of Mutilation to get a hint at how wild these songs were for their time. Yet behind this aggressive post punk there was great songwriting with stinging guitars from Joey Santiago and the great rhythm section of David Loverling and Kim Deal. The latter were sophisticated in their simplicity. Also appealing was the vocal interplay between Kim Deal and Black Frances.<br />There isn't a bad song on this CD even though lots of territory is covered from the faux anglo rock of La La Love You to the punk meets pop of Gouge Away.<br />In many respects this is the blueprint of many modern punk and alternative acts. What sets it apart from recordings in 1989 is it's unabashed vitality and sense of humor. This is a great rock album that should not be missed.
630575067X|3.0|If you watch this movie more than three times, it becomes addictive. You know like watching Demolition Man (or any Stallone movie for that matter) that's absolutely terrible but goes well with pizza, beer and no questions asked. I personally got a kick out of Qui Gon and his \\"Don't think, feel\\" philosophy which has gotten the human race in tons of trouble all ready. Yeah I am going to use that philosophy in dealing with everybody from now on. Portman's acting was...well it was better than...well okay it wasn't that great but what you were expecting a Shakespearean experience watching a Star Wars movie? Jar Jar was a character that never should've been created but I am not George Lucas so who am I criticize. Attack of the Clones, stupid title but you know we're not talking about a movie that will define the genre, it may define a generation for a few losers, weirdos and people who live in their parent's basement, but it won't be the topic of discussion two hundred years from now. Hey Phantom Menace is better than half the Star Trek movies and I must say with better acting.  I look forward to Attack of the Clones!
0780020685|5.0|This movie is beautifully shot , even(and especially) the battle scenes .Kurosawa's Japanese countryside looks more like Tolkiens Middle Earth than Japan(hear that P. Jackson?) ...

1572522232|2.0|This film was not terrible it just wasn't good.  And the plot was convulted to point of absurdity.  I mean the end when she killed the old bedridden witch was kinda cool and the upstairs attic floor covered with maggots was original but other than that you had this invisible killer going around slashing up girls, I mean you can at least see Jason or the Candyman but this killer in the movie just seems like the keygrip guy or the studio janitor being called into be that \\"deranged but unseen killer dude\\" and imitate I guess the evil unseen spirit force of the witches. This movie was and I mean this STUPID!...  I tried to like this movie but I just couldn't hang.

Even though this isnt the first CD they made it's the one that made them really famous. If you have at least one Nine Inch Nails cd or like at least one of their songs then you must get this CD and to get the FULL enjoyment of the songs on here you should also get their &quot;Fixed&quot; CD which has remixes of most or all of the songs on this cd! The most beautiful thing about life is music! The most beautiful thing about music is Nine Inch Nails!
B0000028M7|5.0|This is one of the best albums by possibly the best band ever, the music is tight, solid, melodic, heavy, and uncomparibly dark. The songwriting is superb, and DIRT symbolizes why Alice In Chains was one of the most influential bands of the 90's.  Its so sad that last week, we lost Layne Staley. Upon hearing this, my mind just drew a blank, I was completely blown away. He had an incredibly unique voice, and the music he and Jerry Cantrell wrote will stand the test of time and outlive all the other little [junk] bands like Creed, Godsmack, Nickelback, Puddle of Mudd, ect....
B00005U18E|3.0|Can you think of someone more perfect for the movie? I think Renée Zellweger was the BEST choice for the main character of \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\". I personally remember watching the trailer for the movie and the promotional ads, thinking about how bad the movie would be or how boring the characters were. Obviously I was wrong. I can't say the movie is a blockbuster because it's not true (as you should've noticed by yourself), but I have to clearly state that this movie will make you feel good about yourself even if you weight 300 pounds. Definetely.<br />The movie itself is about a girl whose life is just as messy as lots of other publicists who are about to lose their jobs if they don't come up with an interesting idea soon. Bridget, Renée Zellweger's character, ends up doing a new year resolution and starts to avoid her feel-good cigarrettes (casual or post-sexual activity) and lots of other things that had become a vice for her. The picture is filled with super funny situations, for example the costumes party where she ends up dressing as a funny-as-hell bunny with a white round tail.<br />Although I enjoyed this movie very much, I don't think it's a best-buy choice to buy the VHS or DVD versions of the movie, I'm sorry but I just can't personally see myself watching this movie over and over again. Definetely a good movie to watch, but not to abuse of.
0694003611|5.0|I love to read this book to my son before he goes to bed.  I never tire of it and recently he pointed out to me that the mouse is on every page.  Now we look for the mouse and love when the old lady whispers hush!
B00003CXTG|4.0|Pearl Harbor was a movie that caught my attention for a long time. Ever since I first heard of it, and since the first time I heard of that white boy, Josh Harnett, I haven't stopped hearing about those two. Pearl Harbor literally exposed Josh Harnett to the public eye, so I obviosly thought this movie was something to watch.<br />I must say the movie sets were awesome, and all the battles were perfectly arranged so it would look extremely real. But what got my attention the most is that the movie is &quot;not another war movie&quot;, it is more than that. I must confess it almost brought tears to my eyes, and I must say that it's hard to catch me crying during a movie (and no, I'm not considering myself a super-macho-man...it's the truth). My personal oppinion is that this movie uses the context of the Pearl Harbor battle as a secondary plot to cover the main one, which is the love triangle represented by Harnett's, Affleck's and Beckingsale's characters. I can say this movie makes you think a lot......would you or wouldn't you fall in love with your best friend's girl if he dies?? Would this be something to feel ashamed of?? I think this movie really shows what true friendships are about...they're all about giving your life to save the one person who has always supported you since you were little.<br />The DVD version of the movie takes you behind the scenes of the movie, and also lets you watch the great vide for &quot;There You'll Be&quot; by Faith Hill. I recommend you to buy this movie if you're not bothered by long films and/or romantic movies masked as war movies, and of course, it's a top buy if you have a Home Theater Entertainment System like the one I've got at home!
0312955006|5.0|The H. Bosch novels have a lot of people and situations and the thinking of the people in the situations.<br />All of it seems true:  people have quirks and extraneous concerns and agendas.  A good, if standard, set of cops and management.<br />Only a bit strained in the way Harry always ends up alone with the perp, and how Harry is the smartest man on the team, and therefore always figures everything out via pure reason.  Also, of course, after being wrong the required 2 times.<br />(OK, cops are selected to have IQs of around 100, but tests aren't very good, so there could be a Harry who is much smarter than most cops.  Also, the best at any profession are 10X the average whereever statistics are collected.  So, maybe.)<br />Other than this, great novels.
B00003CXI0|4.0|When I first heard that the movie was coming out, and as the premiere date came closer, I started to feel really curious to know about this so-called wizard boy, Harry something. Of course, by that time, why someone like me would have heard something about this 11 year old boy, or maybe about his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger? I was sure getting away from something I couldn't skip, and that is the much-hyped media phenomenom Harry Potter.<br />After being harrassed by my own sister and bored as hell in one rainy day, I finally decided to read the first pages of this book called \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\", the first of four books available at the moment. I was caught by the magic of the book and read it within two days. I couldn't stop looking at it! it was like an obsession, thiking 24/7 about what would that package at Gringotts have inside and things like that. It was then when I started to follow the new trend, the Harry Potter one.<br />It was finally time to go and watch the movie at the theater. After a superlong line, I got the enter the theater and I could watch the most faithful adaptation of the book to the screen that could have been done. The movie itself is a really well-done picture, where all the characters look exactly as you pictured them when you read the book and re-created the scenes in your mind...you could have swore someone read your mind and put what you thought on film!!<br />Although the movie has countless magnificent special effects, and some breath-taking scenes such as the impopular Quidditch match, I definetely prefer the book, which in my opinion is 10x better then the movie. But at the end it's not so bad, that's why it will get 4 stars ...<br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, it's something I recommend!!! I'll be definetely getting the DVD version of it, not because of me but because of the whole family!
B00005JKED|4.0|This movie keeps you guessing: is he good, is he bad?  It is the first day in the Narcotics division for Ethan Hawke's character.  He has to balance trying to impress his new boss (Denzel Washington) and orienting himself to his new environment.  The result is an entertaining and different kind of movie.  Highly recommended.  (Remember, this is the movie for which Washington received his Oscar for best male actor in a leading role.  He did a great job here, but IMO he should have won it for Malcolm X.)

B000003S5H|4.0|Being a fan of a wide swath of electronic music (and being a high school-aged American with limited access to music that interests me) I've had to keep my options open and not discriminate before having listened to something. For all moral purposes I should inherently dislike any French band (seeing as their country gave us musical wonders such as Johnny Hallyday and Jean-Jacques Goldman), but I've found that bands like Daft Punk and Air have tried and succeeded in breaking away from the rut of typical French........garbage.    \\"Moon Safari\\" is probably one of the best imports that I've heard in a long time. \\"Sexy Boy\\" had some moderate impact in America, but \\"Ce Matin-la\\" and \\"Kelly Watch the Stars\\" are other tracks that deserve some attention. My only wish would be that some of the lounge grooves would get a little of the treatment that the songs on \\"Premiers Symptomes\\" got. Still, it's for the most part chill-out music akin to selected tracks from Groove Armada's \\"Vertigo,\\" a genre in which quality tends to be sparse.    I'd still take Massive Attack's \\"Mezzanine\\" or Basement Jaxx's \\"Remedy\\" over \\"Moon Safari,\\" though.
B00005JKBC|1.0|As the other reviewers mentioned, there is no way to turn off the close captioning for the hearing impared.  It is annoying - we turned the movie off after 20 minutes and spent another hour trying to turn off the close captioning.  Must be a DVD design flaw but why did not one notice this?<br />Alas, the movie is a clever affair with many twists and turn and I enjoyed seeing it in the theater.  Hopefully they will release a corrected DVD soon.
B000002KHH|5.0|Band takes the planet by storm with their first eponymous album then follows it up inside the year with a top ten single and a second even better album. You couldnt make it up. Theres no holding back either, no resting on any laurels. They hit us with political commentary couched in heavy metal irony in War Pigs follow it up with the surprise hit Paranoid which introduced the masses to heavy metal the hard way - like it or not it was there and in your face. They proceed through the hypnotic dreamy Planet Caravan then rouse us with another demonic riffing slap in the face with Iron Man. If youre not panting yet dont worry you will be. Electric Funeral will batter you into submission and then Hand of Doom the song that had my dad threatening to throw me out, lock me up, send me to boarding school when he heard me listening to it at fourteen (four years after its release). It was bad enough that my room looked like the inside of a crypt (didnt everyone have black walls?) and I had been listening recently to some suspiciously weird music (Pink Floyd) but to come in just as Ozzy was instructing in his most diabolically persuasive manner Push the needle in about put the tin lid on it. He couldnt come in when Rat Salad was playing could he? No words there to upset him although its not what youd call middle of the road acoustic. He really wouldnt have liked it, but I would have got away with a snide comment or two How can you listen to this rubbish? rather than the full outraged father scenario. The fact that by the time hed finished lecturing me Ozzy was into the sublimely wickedly heavy Fairies Wear Boots didnt help. Paranoid is touted as their finest and I wont argue that its up there although I think Sabbath Bloody Sabbath has the edge  just.
6302732875|5.0|I like watching David Mamet films. However, I think the uncritical adoration his films often receive are usually a bit over the top. Many of his films collapse into a state of over-baked, preposterous, and unentertaining fiascoes that many people laud because they feel like the SHOULD laud them. One is not less smart for calling a dud a dud. The recent THE SPANISH PRISONER is a great example. HOUSE OF GAMES is another watchable, yet overrated film that is heaped with ejaculations of praise.<br />On the other hand, we have GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS. This is one of those movies where I begin to appreciate it more thinking about it afterward. A converted play, and a very obviously converted play, the movie is a tremendous work of fantastic actors playing their hearts out with words that show violence can be as much linguistic as it is active.<br />Jack Lemmon gives easily the greatest performance of his life in this movie. I've always had lukewarm feelings about Jack Lemmon's acting, thinking him typecasted into the neurotic goonball Felix roles from the hysterical ODD COUPLE. The remake of 12 ANGRY MEN wasn't so bad, but I couldn't help comparing him to Henry Fonda. The embarrassingly bad confirmation of my tepid feelings was his hapless rendition of Marcellus in Branagh's HAMLET.<br />In GLENGARRY, Jack Lemmon is simply amazing as Shelly. The terror of being unable to do his job, of the frustration of self-bout, and the fear for his daughter are all played out perfectly. Needing to do a job that requires confidence in order to gain his confidence, but not having the confidence to his job was an excruciating dilemma. The emasculating circumstances, and Lemmon's acting out the discomfiting emotions is worth seeing.<br />Al Pacino is also outstanding as Ricky Roma. Ed Harris, the manipulative, yet shallow Dave Moss was also excellent. Harris' portrayal of the angry, near-breakdown of him in his dialogue with Pacino and Lemmon certainly shows what a great actor he is. Kevin Spacey --the Enemy-- as the manager was also outstanding; the guy who was everybody's enemy, yet had to run an office that relied on battle and struggle, not cooperation. But Alec Baldwin is amazing as the \\"guy from the home office\\" who chews everyone out. All of the characters are attacked not just professionally, but their masculinity is attacked as well, and the rest of the movie really hinges on that insecurity.
B000002KE2|5.0|If the fans were ever going to feel short-changed by a Sabbath album it wasn't going to be this one. Never afraid to experiment they made this their most varied yet. The opening and epic 'Wheels of Confusion' incorporating a killer guitar solo immediately reminds you just who you are dealing with here, in case you'd forgotten since 'Master of Reality'. And if you were worrying that there might have been some drying up of inspiration forget it 'Tomorrow's Dream' will dismiss those particular doubts quite nicely thank you very much. So here we have the world's heaviest of heavy metal bands we all know what to expect right? Wrong. This is familiar but never predictable. They had played around with melodic before in 'Planet Caravan' and 'Solitude' and got away with it so now they give us a full blown ballad in 'Changes' and being Sabbath they succeed beyond our wildest expectations in delivering romanticism without the saccharine. There is a quality to Ozzy's inimitable voice that conveys real pain and heartfelt emotion and the understated keyboard and strings accompaniment here is mesmerising. Counter that with the sweaty, dirty 'Supernaut' and you're back to uncompromising heaviest of heavy and they slam the message home with an iron fist in 'Cornucopia' and 'Under the Sun' in case anyone was beginning to think they might be getting soft. After eulogising cannabis in 'Sweet Leaf' on the preceding album this time they give us a cautionary tale about cocaine abuse in the compelling 'Snowblind'. And they'll just turn it all on its head again by throwing in another delicate little instrumental in 'Laguna Sunrise'. Confused? You won't be. It works.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|...Relationship of Command is, without a doubt, one of the best albums you will ever buy.  Or not buy, if you're masochistic enough to pass it up.  At first, ATDI is abrasive, even hard to listen to.  But, if you let them play, if you hear it as a whole, not the sum of it's parts, you'll see it for what it is.  Sometimes serious to the point of agony (Invalid Litter Dept.), other times flat out goofy (Rolodex Propaganda) this is album runs the gauntlet, and comes out on the other side without a scratch.  The songs are well-written, well-performed, and every moment is dripping with charisma and emotion.  It's hard to describe, or even fully understand how great ATDI is, and how great they could've gotten.  ...
B000002KDO|5.0|After two sensationally successful debut albums inside a year a band could be forgiven for taking it a little easy. Taking it easy and Black Sabbath? Thankfully these are two mutually exclusive concepts. Not content with rocking `em in the aisles with relentless touring on both sides of the Atlantic they headed into the studio to record this. Another unashamed paean to drugs `Sweet Leaf' has the fans skinning up to the heaviest metal yet to get their beliefs challenged Sabbath style in `After Forever.' `Children of the Grave' is the seething, bass-laden call to shoulder heavy metal arms that has the power to stir even thirty years on. No one does heavy like Sabbath and who else would have the nerve to insert a melodic, wistful little instrumental such as `Orchid' in amongst some of the hardest and darkest riffs ever produced? This was the thing that always confounded the hovering critics just waiting for them to fall flat on their collective arse - these guys had so many more strings to their heavy metal bow than just the riffing one and they weren't afraid to demonstrate that versatility. There is no noticeable diminution of quality or any hint of letting up here - this confirms and consolidates what had come before and leaves you in a fever of anticipation for the next. Of the first six albums I would say this is the heaviest with the exception of `Sabotage.
B000002UJQ|5.0|There's something strange about Radiohead.  Go anywhere where serious music fans congregate, and you'll find Radiohead fans.  Electronica fans love Radiohead, Metal fans love Radiohead, Hipster's love Radiohead, Radiohead gets pop-radio success, Hip Hop fans love Radiohead.  What is it about Radiohead that not only consistently garners critical acclaim, but also achieves pop success on all fronts?  I don't know, if I did I'd be a millionaire, cause I'd make my own band and copy it.  There's something intangible about Radiohead, something otherworldly.  They pull inspiration from so many directions, and yet still come up with something not only genuinely their's, but something that sounds honest.  It'd be easy to do what Radiohead does and sound contrived, but they never do.  <br />OK Computer is Radiohead's best album.  It's that perfect blend, a wonderful step between the guitar rock of The Bends, and the guitarless Sigur Ros inspired experimentation of Kid A.  This band has a way of making disturbing things incredibly beautiful, and in spite of that, more disturbing.  Not many bands could sing about a plane crash, and call the song &quot;Lucky&quot;, without it sounding like some bad joke.  Radiohead does it, and does it with authority.  <br />People looking for the future of music, need only turn to Radiohead.  They may not be my favorite band, but they are the most intriguing I've ever heard.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Some years ago, I happend to come across, \\"All of you\\", I immediately noticed the solidy of her voice, at the same time I realized how she could be able to create those intimate and sexy atmospheres. I think that all her albums have the same caracteristics, which remain the same for the being that is her best quality.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|I have never been a fan of Enrique, the occasional pop song has caught my ear, but that's about it. However, when my friend insisted I listen to &quot;Escape&quot; in the car, I was surprised at the poppy fun feel that the whole album has. I am not one for pop, in fact, I hate it. But when you want a fun CD to stick on, this is great to get some pre-party nerves out, or to just dance around to in your living room. Kinda like Darren Hayes meets latin pop. Worth your while, &quot;Don't Turn Off The Lights&quot;, &quot;One Night Stand&quot; and &quot;Love to See You Cry&quot; are amazing tunes, enjoy everyone!

B000066C6Z|5.0|This film was done by the same people who made \\"Airplane\\" and the \\"Police Squad\\" movies.  I enjoy this film more.  It is just as silly as the others, if not more so. I think the jokes work better in this film. <br />The film takes place in some unnamed East German-like country.  The time is something between today, the 50s, the 40s and somewhere in between. It parodies teen rock-and-roll movies, french resistance films, Blue Lagoon and a bunch of other stuff thrown in for good measure. Val Kilmer plays a rock-and-roll teen idol named Nick Rivers.  He gets involved with a bunch of resistance fighters in a represive soviet block country that plans on taking over the world.  Funnier than it sounds. Surreal comedy at its best. (The guard falling off the castle wall is one of my favorite gags.)<br />How can you argue with a movie that starts with a Beach Boys parody called \\"Skeet Surfing\\"? ...
0425173895|5.0|Hello,<br />This was the first book I had read by Agatha Christie, this was suggested to me by my Uncle. Really an excellent one to start with and the best of Agatha Christie she is just too good for murder mysteries. After this book I have never read any other than hers almost all, This book provides you with great descrption on the murder and the characters involved but one will not be able to say who the murderer is till the very end.<br />A MUST FOR ONE WHO LIKES MURDER MYSTERY.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Like many people I have seen MOULIN ROUGE, and was thus interested in seeing the first film in Baz Luhrmann's trilogy, STRICTLY BALLROOM. While it's not quite as exciting or sensual as MOULIN ROUGE, it is very entertaining.<br />While the storyline is predictable, the actors' performances are authentic and compelling, especially the relationship between Paul Mercurio and Tara Morice. They have real on-screen chemistry: there is a believable sense of romantic and sexual tension that fuels their desire to win the Pan-Pacific Dance Championship.<br />Obviously Baz Luhrmann loves using lots of saturated color and exaggerated but authentic costumes to bring the world of ballroom dancing to life for those of us unfamiliar with its rituals and triumphs. The dance sequences have to be seen: they are nothing less than incredible!<br />The interactions between the characters is often outright hilarious, and at times poignant. A very enjoyable and touching story--like a fairy tale infused with lots of energy and zest for living. <br />WONDERFUL!!!
B00005176F|4.0|I came upon Song 2 last year and didn't really like it...it sounded..uhm..I don't know...I was (and still am) a heave Bee Gees fan, so I was used to more melodical and balad-like stuff. Well, now I listen to bands like Dream Theatre, Depeche Mode, Placebo, The Verve, NIN, HIM etc...and I do like BLUR...So, to British music-lovers I can only say: Give it a try...I highly reccommend This is a low, To The End and Coffee and TV...honestly...surprisingly cool stuff...simply British.

B0000214F0|2.0|Much has been made of this film becouse of it's graphic violence and sex, however when just taken on it's own merits it's hard to watch. The movie is about Caligula (Malcolm McDowell) a cruel and ruthless Roman leader of 37AD. His sickness and cruelty is well known. THe movie is done by Penthouse founder Bob Guccione who in his own right is a very smart man but I think forgot what he was doing. Peter O'Toole, Helen Mirren, and Sir John Gielgud are all in this film but it is well known that all were very upset with the finished product. Mirren, a well known stage actor, plays Caligula's wife, a women who has gotten around. O' Toole is Tiberius the Cesar before Caligula. And Gielgud is Nerva. All the actors in this film are giving very bad, and somtimes stupid, dilouge to recite, but being so good the actors even pull of that demanding of a feat. At time's O' Toole is slightly over the top but considering the material he was giving he may have thought that it was worth overacting. Gielgud, however, seems to take his role very seriously and pulls off the role with a real flair, it has been said he was the most upset with the film becouse after it was shot Guccione went back and added some very hard sex scenes. Gielgud demanded his name be pulled from the film and to this day I have not seen one cover, credit, or list that mentions him as Sir. I originally saw this on cable TV and thought it was an interesting, if not uneven, film. So I thought that if I rented the Un-cut version I may find it more lucid, however it seemed more uneven than ever. If you are woundering if there is really any hardcore sex in the film or not I am here to tell you that there is. There are very graphic moments in the film. There is somthing to be said for the acting however and all of those involved have said that they thought they were making somthing different than what they saw at the screening. I have to belive them becouse the acting is at times very good. The movie however can't be saved by the good acting. The directing is really very bad and the film is very badly paced. When all is said and done it is a real shame that this movie is in the same light as Ben-Hur and Sparticus, when the film has no real right to be mentioned in such high company.I would like to this film forgoten about and left to rot on the shelves where it belongs. It does nothing to help the actors image and nothing to help the film industry. Sir John Gielgud and Peter O'Toole would bouce back with Arthur and My Favorite Year respectivly but Malcolm McDowell never recovered. He made a very good film in Time After Time but other than that his career never came around agian. In the end Caligula is a bad film with some real controversy to make people want to see it. I rented it to \\"see what all the fuss was about.\\" After all is said and done and the movie is just asked to stand on it's own it fails. Good acting cannot save bad fimlmaking.....

0783217048|4.0|I went with my husband and a friend.  The friend walked out in the opening sequence.  He was really freaked out by Patrick and Wesley changing from men to women.  Me, I loved it.  I don't give 5 stars at all and rarely 4's, so this is high praise from me (I'm a hard grader).  Because you don't see John go through the tranformation, its really hard to remember he is a man unless you've seen him in other roles.  Wesley is very silly and very camp.  Patrick is too darn beautiful and stately.  Very scary.  As others have said, forget the plot and enjoy the fun.

0380002930|4.0|When I first heard of this book, I thought the name was odd and the fact that it was about rabbits really turned me off to the book. It took me a few years to really want to read it, cause like most people I didn't want to read about cute little bunnies, that's just boring. One day while wandering through the children's section at borders (they hold a lot of good classics that are easy to understand) I came across the movie Water Ship Down. I read the back to see what it really was about, turns out its not about cute little bunnies. What this book really is about is what life is like from the point of view of a rabbit. And just like human lives things are not always pretty. I found that this book was very interesting, but I would suggest that you have an open mind about things. If you do then this book will take you in to the lives of a very mysterious creature.
6302000823|5.0|I wonder where I can find the newly released director's cut? I will appreciate if anyone would give me the information.
B0000025GW|4.0|This album was a great shock, understandably, to many people when it came out - almost as much as Self-Portrait was. For that reason, and for Dylan's subsequent backing off from his Born Again phase - which has since received a certain \\"cornpone\\" status in his mythology - this album is often overlooked by many people. Let me be honest: if it wasn't Bob Dylan who made this album, I probably never would've listened to it, much less bought it. I am not a religous person, and Gospel and Gospel-inflected music are not among my favorites. I held off on buying this and made it one of my last Dylan purchases. However, let me be the first to tell you that I was pleasantly surprised! Odd as it may seem, this album is actually a return for Dylan in many ways. Ever since Blood On The Tracks, Dylan had been dipping his toe into more and more complex musical visions - the international vibe of the Desire album, the Rolling Thunder Revue, the big band-addled Street Legal, and his subequent \\"Vegas\\" tour - and this album goes back to the stripped-down rock band arrangements that he had long been known for. Whether or not you like it as much as his previous two albums - I don't, personally - it's easy to see that it's more focused, more concise, and that Bob was way more into it. Here we see him, perhaps for the first time ever, trying his hardest to make his music as smooth, polished, and presentable as possible. Clearly, Dylan was trying to reach as many as people as possible with this album, something he had never cared about before. The production by Barry Beckett and Jerry Wexler on this album is immaculate, and still sounds great today. It sounds better than anything he has recorded and released since (with the exception of the re-mastered songs on Biograph.) It's a sad fact that Columbia has neglected the Bob Dylan catalog - without argument, their most important artist - with only one of his albums, Street Legal, being remastered; and this is one of his few albums that stillsounds great today. Furthermore, Dylan took even greater steps: hiring the then-in vogue (and terrific) group Dire Straits to be his backing band, and going down to Alabama to record the album with the Muscle Shoals Horns and a full gospel choir. Although the music on this album is not his best, and certainly not his most original, it is a very tight, focused effort. Mark Knopfler has gotten props several times for his playing on this album, and it's easy to see why. The rest of the players, as well as the production, are top-notch as well. The album is not necessarily what you might expect lyrically, either. Certainly, it's steeped highly in Christian imagery and Biblical allusion, particularly that of the book of Revelation. But, Dylan had been weaving Biblical allusions into his lyrics for his entire caree - from early tracks like When The Ship Comes In to practically the entire album John Wesley Harding, to the deeply spiritual-leaning Street Legal. Of course, he had never approached it the way he does on here. They are not merely enrichening the songs, they ARE the songs. The lyrics can be a bit dogmatic at times - and, of course, self-righteous - but you can enjoy, and like, them regardless of your own personal set of beliefs. Even if you don't agree with the opinions expressed within, you can still appreciate them as art. They do often have a very arrogant ring to them - Bob is practically breathing fire and brimstone on some of the tracks! No less a figure than Nick Cave has gone on record as saying that this is his all-time favorite album, citing its \\"anger and nastiness... certainly not like the thing you find on most Christian albums.\\" We get bitter, impassioned performances from Dylan on such songs as Gotta Serve Somebody and Slow Train. He hadn't been this focused and into his material since... well, quite a long time. You can tell he's really into it, and truly pouring his heart out into his vocals and his performances. Standout tracks include the Gotta Serve Somebody, a \\"list\\" song with some truly biting vocals from Dylan (it's just unbelievably cool to hear him stretch out that word \\"somebody\\"), for which he won a greatly deserved vocal performance Grammy. Precious Angel is nothing less than a love song - a moving ode to the woman who turned him on to Christianity. Slow Train is an absolutely ferocious song that attacks corrupt politics - one of the album's sub-themes - while weaving in much distressing imagery from Revelation. I Believe In You is an absolutely beautiful song about unwavering faith (Dylan as JOB.) To be sure, not all the songs are of this quality, and some even border on embarrassing, now. Still, this is quite a good album, and an essential one for any Dylan fan. Whatever one might say about Dylan's conversion, one thing is certain: it re-invigorated him artistically, and got him interested in his work again and he turned out his most focused and concise album since Blood On The Tracks.
B00003CX8J|5.0|I just rented this dvd today and it was incredible! By seeing the x-men being real people,it makes you see a different side of them. It is a wonderful movie that I am going to buy. I wish that they would make a sequel, but we'll have to wait for that. It even has recent oscar winner Halee Barry( sorry if i spelled it incorrectly) and the hottie hugh jackman. If you aren't gonna buy it, it's deffentely at least worst seeing.
B000002UAX|5.0|By 1968 the Beatles had already recorded enough awesome albums to be considered lifes work but that November another landark album was dropped into stores and I wouldn't doubt that the hottest Christmas gift in 1968 was The White Album.  However now days this double album is more than just a good album it's one of the Beatles top 4 best albums in my opinion.<br />The album itself is the group's most diverse as experimentations of almost every genre on it.  It's no real secret that this album changed the music industry forever but so did many other Beatles albums.<br />The opening track BACK IN THE USSR is a fun Beach Boys like rocker.  DEAR PRUDENCE is a dreamy John Lennon tune.  GLASS ONION reflects most of the band's previous work.  OB-LA-DI, OB-LA-DA is a light hearted almost reggae like tune.  WILD HONEY PIE is a catchy ditty.  THE CONTINUING STORY OF BUNGALOW BILL is fairly excessive but the chorus is catchy.  WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS is one of the best songs on this enite album.  It features some great guitar work by George Harrsion and Eric Clapton.  HAPPINESS IS A WARM GUN is rather alternative.  MARTHA MY DEAR is a wonderful Paul McCartney ballad.  I'M SO TIRED is a soothing relaxing song.  BLACKBIRD is a classic!  Great acousitc by McCartney.  PIGGIES is a bizarre novelty tune by Harrison.  ROCKY RACOON and DON'T PASS ME BY both have country rock feels to them.  The latter being sung by Ringo.  WHY DON'T WE DO IT IN THE ROAD? is a hard rock ditty with some lively vocals by McCartney.  I WILL is another beautiful McCartney acoustic tune and JULIA may be one of the finest tunes wrtten by John Lennon.  BIRTHDAY is a great hard rocker opener to part two of this album.  YER BLUES is hard driving blues rock.  MOTHER NATURE'S SON is yet another McCartney acoustic of beauty.  EVERYBODY'S GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE EXCEPT ME AND MY MONKEY is an acid rocker but the lyrics are bizarre.  SEXY SADIE has a nice jazzy rock feel to it.  HELTER SKELTER is easily the hardestrocking Beatles tune out there.  LONG LONG LONG is an echoing ballad by Harrison.<BR>REVOLUTION 1 is a classic although this is the slow blues rock feeling one not the high voltage hard rock hit single but still this is very good.  HONEY PIE is a piece of 1920's style music which McCartney was perhaps influenced by Michael Nesmith!  For the wool hat wearing member of the Monkees had recorded a composition with a simlilar feel to this earlier in the year!  SAVOY TRUFFLE is another Harrison/ Beatles classic that is one of my personal faves.  CRY BABY CRY is a unique Lennon tune.  REVOLUTION 9 is a waste of record space and shoud not be among this brilliant collection of songs.  GOOD NIGHT is a charming closer sung by Ringo Starr.<br />Overall I would say the Beatles White Album ranks in the top four Beatles albums.  It is one of my personal favourites and it can easily be considered a timeless work of art.  Unfortunetly they don't make albums like this anymore but thank the lord for cd reissues!  The White Album proved that the Bealtes were rock 'n roll saints!  Highly recommended!
B0000028M7|5.0|With the death of Layne Staley, another of the \\"grunge\\" bands that dominated the early 1990's has officially bitten the dust, leaving \\"Dirt\\" as their grandest statement. With their sweeping, grinding guitars, downcast lyrics, and Staley's haunting vocals, Alice in Chains provided a soundtrack for many the angst-ridden high schooler, myself included. With the dark lyrical perspective and heavy, disortion-laden guitar work of classic metal infused with ample doses of melody, \\"Dirt\\" possessed a very rare mix of metal edge and pop appeal. That combination was evident right from the beginning with the hit \\"Them Bones,\\" which placed sweeping melodic vocals over a fast, grinding guitar riff, with some very downcast lyrics thrown in to boot. Other songs, including \\"Rain When I Die,\\" \\"Down in a Hole,\\" and \\"Dirt\\" brought a slow, dirgelike quality into the mix, with more tortured vocals and lyrics. The hit \\"Rooster\\" was of course another noteworthy song, with Staley's distorted vocals telling a grim tale of the horrors experienced by those who fought in Vietnam; the track also features a fine guitar solo from Jerry Cantrell. \\"Angry Chair\\" boasts a rhythmically driven melody that is almost irresistible, making it a great prelude to \\"Would,\\" which of course remains Alice in Chains's signature song. From the caustic guitars of the opening, to Staley's haunting vocals, to the cathartic shouting of the chorus, \\"Would\\" perfectly captured the dark atmosphere and technical proficiency that made Alice in Chains's music so potent. It's too bad that the door has now been slammed on any chance of their making any more music, especially with the rock scene as stale and repetitive as it is now. There's no more Alice in Chains or Soungarden, but Creed are still selling millions of records? It just doesn't seem fair.
B00003CX5P|5.0|A lot of people don't think much of this film.  To be frank, I was pleased with the resulting product.  In fact, the only thing I did not think appropriate was the film's TITLE!<br /><br />The whole point of this film was esentually to show how Anikin was admited to the Jedi order and would eventually be fated to bring down the galaxy.  The story is told almost in a child like way.  Though serious, it has a light-hearted nature at it's core that is almost like A NEW HOPE.<br /><br />But it is not a out-and-out war film like the 3 original films.  No, this is a different genre altogether  -- politics.  It shows what would eventually lead to the Republic's fall.  The End of the Begining.  It's told with a light-heart  -- because it's all down hill from here.  Lucas clearly knew what he was doing.  The next 2 films clearly will get darker.  I enjoyed this episode much and eagerly await the next 2.  I am only saddened that Lucas canceled episodes 7 through 9.
6305311463|3.0|With a sudden bame, blast and boom! The load sound efx burst into your ears to the impact of where you can't take it. One of the most commercial Jerry Bruckheimer films ever and opened doors for Michael Bay for future jobs. Bay,Known for better movies like \\"the Rock\\" or not so great movies as \\"Pearl Harbor\\" this movie is a whorle of his great mixture in lots of action. In previous films Michael Bay has proven he can make an excellent action movie ,but when the script fails to depict charactorization and plot the film has only one thing to holds its weight on... Its humor and its action. Bruce Wills is fun to see him agian in the genre that made him a Hollywood superstar. Ben Affleck has his moments as well This movie is worth watching for a good time just if you don't ask for too much of it.
6300183211|5.0|I've seen this movie more times than I can remember.  It's a rights-of-passage film that should be required viewing for all men between the ages 17 and 23.  So many lessons learned about life.  Loyalty, Greed, Envy...all sins and the consequences of such sins.<br />The dialogue -- the writers were pure genius.  The acting -- When I hear the words Al Pachino all I think of is Tony Montanna.  Pachino is so good that it's hard to believe Tony is a fictional character.<br />The restaurant scene where tony and his wife exchange harsh words and he gets out of his seat and address the other customers is among the finest scenes in the history of movies.  That one minute display -- from one guy (drunk and staggering) to others, confessing his ability to be a bad guy and challenging others to examine the &quot;bad guy&quot; within.  He delivers the classic line &quot;...say good night to the bad guy&quot;  Tony exits that restaurant (stepping out of the camera frame) with one last warning (perhaps an ad lib)&quot;...a bad guy is coming...better get out of his way&quot;.  Classic.  Perfect scene.  It will stay with you forever as we all can't assess others without assessing ourselves.
B00005MP58|4.0|A & E has so far released P & P on video three times beginning in 1996.  The first release was a six volume VHS set, the next release was on DVD in 1998 and most recently the DVD was re-released as a 'special edition'. The latter two DVD releases have had the legion of P & P enthusiasts, myself included, wringing their hands at A & E's short sighted handling of them.  <br />The 1998 DVD release was marred by poor picture quality that at times was even worse than the VHS edition.  Fans were also stunned by the complete absence of any supplementary program material.  Material that exists in great quantity at BBC and has been published in a beautiful book entitled \\"The Making of Pride & Prejudice\\".<br />Last year I was delighted to learn of the special edition  release on DVD and was looking to purchase it with eager anticipation.  However, as I read the reviews on Amazon.com I realized that something was again amiss with this release.  There were numerous complaints of pale, washed out colors.  These reviews held me back until recently when I took the plunge and purchased the special DVD edition.<br />I first began viewing with the \\"Making of Pride & Prejudice\\" featurette and found it interesting but disappointingly short.  One hopes that someday the more in-depth material available at BBC becomes available.  <br />Then I viewed the entire program and right away noticed seriously washed out pale colors that did no justice to the lavish production.  I also noticed stunning resolution where every detail, such as a wisp of smoke or a strand of hair, was clearly visible.  As I have a large screen TV (32\\") with controls for color, brightness and picture I started playing with different settings.  I found that by simply increasing the color a lot, much of the grandeur and appeal of this delightful program was restored.  <br />I do recommend this DVD strongly to other buyers if they are able to control the color setting on their TV sets.  The stunning resolution makes this the highest quality release yet.  Buying the VHS set makes sense if you cannot control the color settings (I recommend the six tape version rather than the two tape one).  One hopes that some day A & E will get it all right and gift us fans with an 'extra special' edition of Pride & Prejudice.
B00005Q66T|3.0|I think most Madonna fans will not like this album, i did not, though i agree it should've been a two cd set realistically and finacially it was better to do one set, one explanation for the non inclusive tracks like american pie and you must love me are two songs that she did not have a hand in writing (royalties anyone??) another false move was to put in the edits of the songs, nor have any original material, i think this album was hastly put out without much thought behind proper marketing and appeal to the fans who consistently push her albums past 2million sales. hopefully, if shes wise, shell offer a double cd set in 3 years with better packaging.
B00005QDW1|5.0|After the last turkey I bought this whilst I was drunk. When it arrived I put it on in the background and it didn't sound so great, but it stayed in the player and after a few days I found myself really liking it. Not only is it funky as hell, the lyrics are witty. Buy it, trust me.

6304169558|4.0|In order to really appreciate this film you must overlook the obvious.  Such as the fact that many times these tornado chasers somehow seem not to be effected when they are close to the whirlwind.  The special effects are good overall.<br />The chemistry between Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton really pulled me in to the feelings.  The fight in the truck when they get together again is classic.  The characters that they are portraying remind me of many average Jane and Joe's across the country.  The wide variety of personalities that add to the supporting cast are excellent.  Each one, in their own, adding to the overall mood of the movie.  <br />This movie is entertaining (as movies should be) and the flaws are very easily overlooked.  It will be an enjoyable way to pass a few hours some night with the one you love.
B00005B36H|5.0|all i can say is wow. this cd hasn't left my car since i got it almost a year ago. i wasn't into &quot;the grudge&quot; at first because i didn't immediately recognize a hook, but as i kept listening, it grew on me. that swell in the middle completely ingulfs me. &quot;ticks and leeches&quot; is so far my fav. on the album. aside from being an impressive song musically, like one other reviewer said, you can not listen to it without your inner rage coming to the surface...you can't. i love the haunting build-up into parabola. &quot;triad,&quot; though an instrument, will make you move as much as anything on the album.<br />the previous album, &quot;aenima,&quot; is a masterpiece in its own right, and this album continues in that tradition. &quot;aenima&quot; seems to have more &quot;hooks&quot; and the songs are more concise, but this album is just as epic. the only things i will say on that note, is that some of the more &quot;rambly&quot; songs are nice and haunting and pretty wonderful to listen to, but they do get long winded. and if you don't read music or something, you may not appreciate the unusual time signatures as much (and it is  amazing how they work with such time signatures to take you to places you have never been). other than that, you need to experienc tool if you haven't. you will be in awe.
0140277447|4.0|This book is a very important read for anyone who is interested in world history, military history or humanitarian issues.  In order to stop events from happening one must be aware of things that have happened in the past.  This book brings to light atrocities that hopefully will never be repeated.  It also sheds light on the old saying of \\"History is written by the victor\\".  Pointing out the cover up and official denials that the Japanese government stands by, in the face of factual evidence.  Every government in the world, at some point, has written its history for its citizens consumption to benefit themselves and perpetuate their own stranglehold on what their citizens consider the truth.  This book rings true of this fact.<br />Another aspect of the book was the undying stubbornness of many foreign workers from both government agencies and corporations from around the world that obstinately worked to help the Chinese.  They diligently worked to protect many Chinese refugees in the camps that had no legal or international protection.  Just their will kept them safe.  Including an important person in the Nazi party from Germany.  An inspirational side of a horrific event.  A recommended read for anyone who likes to come to their own conclusions and not accept as the whole truth what we were taught, and not taught, in the public school system in America.
B00005JKL8|4.0|not the best military action flick i've seen but definitely will do, good 'nuff that i can't wait til it comes out on DVD, which in fact is in a couple of days....yeeeeehawwww!, i found out it's not a &quot;special edition&quot; or a &quot;collector's edition&quot; so not too sure about the special feature capacity of the dvd version, but i saw the flick in the theatres and reminiscing back to the ending of the movie is all worth the purchase on dvd, typical &quot;good guys always win&quot; type of scenario, but movies are made to ENTERTAIN, not for you to predict and analyze...leave that up to the actors, script writers, agents, director's and producers....watch the flick....be entertained by it and put it back in your collection!....solid 4 stars! way to go Owen and Gene....great oscar caliber performances and a well-done storyline.
6304233639|3.0|Another movie about aliens taking over the earth does initially sound a little boring.  The special effects are good, just the sight of the White House being incinerated and Air Force One flying in front of a wall of flame are thought provoking enough.  Add into the equation Area 51 and the ever present thought that it is a possiblity that no one can deny with any certainty and this is a very thought provoking movie. <br />On the flip side, imagine a stripper and the first lady becoming friends.  An alcoholic crop duster flying U.S. military planes, a jilted ex-husband (who once punched the President) being allowed into the White House to see his ex-wife in the company of the President, the President flying fighter planes in combat and you see the more unbelievable aspect of this film.  But hey, it's the movies and anything is possible. <br />When all is considered this movie is not bad but not great.  Certainly worth the price of admission in a theater or a home rent but I don't believe it will go down as one that is remembered for a very long time.  But in the short run while you are watching and for some time after it will certainly be interesting.

B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac largely represents the kind of brilliance and beauty I've come to expect from this awesome band, Radiohead. The album does have its flaws, like the somewhat pointless - yet far from unlistenable - tracks &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; and &quot;Hunting Bears&quot; and the quite dull opening track. All the other songs, though, are excellent and easily make up the few weaknesses of this album. <br />I've gotten used to that many other people don't necessarily like the kind of music I usually listen to, but I can't help thinking that there must be something wrong in an individual who doesn't see the sheer beauty of this record. While not perhaps as strong as the previous three albums and hardly groundbraking, Amnesiac is far from disappointing and not far from excellence.
0553275976|5.0|Not since The Great Gatsby has a work so completely defined an era with such brutal honesty.  So revealing of the affectations of the period, the filming of this book for the big screen was banned in the Bronx, ironically giving proof to Wolfe's indictment of the liberal political machine of the 1980's.  This is a classic &quot;must read&quot; and, as usual, the film doesn't come near to doing the book justice.  If you haven't read Bonfire, you're not well read.
0131103628|5.0|Just a review or two below this one, you'll see a short review that says &quot;By Programmers, For Programmers&quot;.  This review is absolutely on the nose.<br />I've ALSO been programming for 20+ years, everything from bit-slice microcode to ASP on web pages.  I write C for a living, every day of my life, and have been doing so for about 10 years. I learned C by reading other code in C, and from this book. This is the ONLY book that actually sits on my desk and gets used (OK, so I may have been writing C for 10 years but I'm still a lousy C programmer, OK?).<br />This book is clear, to the point, and authoritative.  It's not in the least annoying.  It doesn't try to be &quot;funny&quot;. It is not over-burdened with stupid &quot;here's what programming is&quot; sorts of tutorial information. It's got a very good index.<br />What more could a professional developer need?
0790743507|4.0|I am 27 years old, so the era of the big musical was well before my time.  Consequently, I've never acquired a proper taste for them.  I do admit, though, that when isolated and out of context, a good musical 'number' can be a beautiful thing: athletic grace, pin-point choreography, a snappy song, all combining together to create a whirling dervish of kinetic energy on the screen, and a visceral thrill in the heart of the audience.  But in the middle of a story, when all the characters break into (superfluous) song and dance, I get annoyed.<br />I mention the above because I've seen Gene Kelly singin' in the rain a couple of dozen times.  But I'd never seen Gene Kelly in &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;.<br />On numerous Hollywood retrospective TV specials, Gene's damp little moment in the street is always accounted for, and I've always enjoyed it.  But I shied away from the movie because, as outlined above, I wondered how it could be as magical when my particular tastes don't want it in the movie?  Well, after having seen the full movie for the first time only recently, I'm here to report, to like-minded individuals, that it maintains all its magic and then some.  <br />This is true probably because the moment is integrated into the story.  It is the culmination of a lovely moment, and an expression of the joy overflowing.  When the other musical numbers are likewise integrated, the film works beautifully.  For a script written after the songs were chosen, with the sole purpose of swiftly getting from song to song (Hey!  Isn't this the story within the movie as well?  Self-reflexivity in a Gene Kelly picture?  Who'd have thunk it?), the story moves along at a nice pace, and rarely is there any questionable narrative logic.<br />But when the musical numbers are superfluous to the story, the film drags.  It appears padded, as if the producers found themselves in the enviable position of being severely under-budget, and decided to blow their wad on grand spectacle.  These numbers always work on their own, though.  &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; is a gargantuan set-piece that is stunning on so many levels, and includes the sensuous moves of Cyd Charisse.  &quot;Moses&quot; finds Donald O'Connor and Kelly caught in rapid-fire linguistic duel at the elocutionist's office, and then a stunning dance dyad.  But neither scene really fits into the story (although the former is almost saved by a funny tag-line).<br />Said story, when it's utilized, is actually quite clever.  Silent film stars Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) must learn to adapt when sound infiltrates their ranks.  One problem: Lina has a voice like an ill parakeet.  Enter Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) a singing-and-dancing pixie who may solve all their problems, while she steals Don's heart.  Throw in happy-go-lucky music man Cosmo Brown (O'Connor) who lightens the mood when needed, and there's your story.  It appears quite frothy on first glance, but is really a deft satire on the Hollywood star machine.<br />The three leads are all, on top of being obviously talented, terribly charismatic.  Kelly never lets that sparkling grin leave his face, even when he's dancing with the grace of a gazelle and the power of a boxer.  O'Connor is a mess of limbs and joints, but will amaze and stun you with his vast array of near-acrobatic moves.  And Reynolds, only 20 at the time, may be unrefined and inexperienced, but she more than matches her male co-stars' energy and gusto.  And her voice, especially on &quot;Good Morning&quot;, is just so bright and cheery you can't help falling for her.  Hagen, for her part, plays a character that's both the villain and the comic foil.  She is strong in both parts of the role.<br />Besides the wonderful musical numbers, the film has a number of sharp comic moments.  Don's recapping of his and Cosmos' early career, where the myth he presents to the media doesn't match the reality, is a funny extended sequence.  The test-screening of&quot;Dueling Cavalier&quot;, Don and Lina's first sound film, is a riotous example of 'Murphy's Law'.  And of course there's O'Connor's famous &quot;Make 'Em Laugh&quot; routine, which most certainly achieves the goal of its title.<br />So against my better judgment and contrary to my prior experiences, I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;.  Its story moved me, its comedy tickled me, and its singing and dancing wowed me.  While not nearly as coherent as I would have liked, you can't ask much more from a movie whose only goal it to entertain you.
6301607929|5.0|Well, here I am watching &quot;Picnic&quot; on AMC, even though I have the video tape!  When I saw it as a 16-yr.-old, I knew the story and characters would haunt me forever. Many years passed before I was able to view this movie again, when Cinemax showed it in Dec. 1989, and that was the first time I'd seen it since 1956. I had a VCR by then and recorded it for my and my husband. When the video was finally made available, I had to own it!  The themes in this movie really do hold true today, though many don't honor them. I'm sure that today's teens would think much of this movie is &quot;hokey&quot; -- too bad, because Joshua Logan did a fine job with this  William Inge play, and the music is also superb.  &quot;Picnic&quot; should be in any video collection of those who truly love a classic love story with all its twists and turns--and a satisfactory resolution.  Kudos to all involved!  BWG
B0000639FE|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was in the theaters when I was 14.  At the time I remember enjoying the movie, but without any specific insight or understanding of the drama on screen.  I simply enjoyed it for all of its entertaining quirks in dialogue and for the unusually involving(for a 14 year old at the time) love story.  Afterwards, I found myself thinking about the movie more and more often throughout the years.  Watching this movie occasionally became a sort of habit for me.  As I matured(at least I hope I have) I came to fully understand the reasons why the film touched me with such significance.  The story dealt with a seemingly successful man who also seemed to have everything a man can want and need.  The character of Jerry Maguire is the perfect archetype or role model that any parent can hope for their sons; successful and stable.  And more often than not most men believe, as they grow up, having a life of financial security and an \\"efficient\\" mate, constitutes happiness and a fulfilling lifestyle.  Those qualities were denounced early on in the movie.  With this knock down of the very things I held high in my priorities in life, the movie was already an attention grabber for me.  Slowly, as the story progressed, it gave Jerry Maguire situations after situations of personal challenges and obstacles to get him to the point where his search for his identity and priorities in his life were over.  Because of this, I hold this film in the highest regard.  It is one of my personal favorites and I'm sure to a lot of others as well.  There are better films than this, sure, but I hold this one dearer to my soul than any movie I've ever seen so far in my life.
B000060P79|5.0|My first time hearing Simple Plan was at a show they played at Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois, when they were on tour with Sugar Ray.  Their performance was amazing... In fact it was so good that every time they would yell out... \\"Are you ready for Sugar Ray...?\\" there would be next to no response. There was not one person I talked to that put the show down. There is not a place on campus you can go without hearing of the band. Everything from flyers, to peoples away messages, to school radio shows, are getting them out there. I have even called Marquette's \\"Grab the Bohn Show\\" and told them about how great the show was and how great the guys were after the show. They sat by their merchandise and signed autographs for anyone that asked. Now the radio show is getting requests for \\"addicted\\" and \\"I'm just a kid\\" a couple times in their 2-hour slot. I rate the CD with a solid 5 stars only because they don't give you the option for 6. Check out there site and just have a taste of Simple Plan. I can guarantee you will buy the CD!!!
B00005RHGK|1.0|i expected a horror movie and i got a pretty good laugh from how dumb it was.  from the horrible acting and facial expressions by the actors to the \\"jeepers creepers\\" song i couldn't seem to make myself jump or freak out, but i was crying from laughter.  what's up with this clive barker figure saying it's the scariest movie what was he doing while he was watching.  i give this minus 5 stars so stay away from the movie unless you feel like getting a cheap laugh...oh wait i paid 4 bucks to rent the thing you know just forget it
B000066744|5.0|This movie is a must see. It is a tale about a boy who is lives his whole life on a charter ship and really gets a master understanding of the piano. I would think it hard to make a story like this one interesting but the writer did a great job along with a superb job by Tim Roth. Roth really put his heart and soul into this role and it really shows. This movie is definatley on my top 5 greatest movies list. This movie has it all: action, suspense, drama, and even comedy. It keeps you interested all the way through and really brings out the emotions of the viewer, not to mention the non-hollywood type ending which just adds the icing to the cake. I give this two thumbs up and recommend it to everyone in any age group.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I bought this movie and watched it with four kids.

0440214041|1.0|This novel makes no sense. A law student does some research and looks up some information in the public records and writes a summary of her findings. OK now this information is , through a lot of contrivance, turned over the FBI.  Conveniently, the head of the FBI wants to hang the President out to dry.  I can live with all of the contrivance up to this point in the story; but, once the brief is turned over to the FBI, they have all of the information the law student had and stronger motivation to hang the President, so why kill the student? And why write a whole novel about attempts to kill her?
B000056K04|4.0|Simply put, this is a great record.  It's quite a twist from what we were used to with the band.  Short songs, more electric guitar and a bit less presence from the other band members.  Even if there are some amazing songs on this CD, I miss the &quot;old&quot; DMB with the violin solos and everything.  Nonetheless, if you have read a bit about the events around the making of this CD, you know it was a step the band ad to take.
B0000636UN|5.0|This cd is awesome!  I am a huge Sheryl Crow fan and with every cd of hers that I have purchased, I have yet to be let down.  This lastest release has not left my player in 5 days and it's really growing on me.  Some stand-out songs that I can't get enough of include &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot;, &quot;You're an Original&quot;, &quot;Diamond Road&quot; and &quot;Hole in My Pocket&quot;.  Any of these could be released as a second single.  However, my favorite song on this album is &quot;Over You&quot;.  It's so good!<br />Whether your new to Sheryl Crow or you've been a long time fan, there is something here for everyone and you will not be disappointed!
B000002B1M|3.0|Not to rehash the whole \\"This-isn't-as-good-as-Illmatic\\" talk that still haunts Nas today, but if Illmatic were a home run, then It was Written was a slide into second base. There are some joints where you find Nas doing his thing, but let's not front, y'all, there was just something missing on his second-go-round.<br />But you can't totally reject this album. \\"If I Ruled the World\\", though packaged for radio and has an R&B hook by Lauryn Hill, still has good lyrics, especially when he says, \\"I'd open the doors in Attica, send them to Africa.\\" \\"Street Dreams\\" and \\"The Set Up\\" are great storytellings in action while the DJ Premier-laced \\"I Give You Power\\" is a good metaphor of Nas being like a gun. And production doesn't always let you down. Havoc (\\"Live N Rap\\", \\"The Set Up\\") and Premo (\\"I Gave You Power\\") will keep you satisfied. And Dr. Dre drops a good beat on \\"Nas is Coming\\", even though the song is pretty lame: If Nas is coming, why is this song in the middle of the album, and didn't he already come in 1992?<br />And that leads to the bad news. I tried my best to sit through filler like \\"Nas is Coming\\", \\"Watch Them N's\\", \\"Black Girl Lost\\", and the album's wannabe-saving grace but saddest moment, \\"Affirmative Action\\". Here, AZ and Nas are transformed into Corleone Fettucini Capone and Escobar, respectively, Foxy Brown drops a confusing math equation of drugs, and Cormega is the only one to have a dope verse.<br />So with this album, Nas got more commercial appeal and was played on the radio, but he lost mad respect from those living in Illmatic's past. Oh well, this doesn't excuse him from the low points on the album, but rappers gotta eat, too.

B0000029GA|5.0|When this came out in my junior year of high school, I went crazy. Some originality in rap for once. The beats and rhymes were ill. I can honestly say that I grew up listening to this record. The best songs are &quot;NY State of Mind&quot;, &quot;Represent&quot; and--well, all of them. Though this was released in 1994, Illmatic still sounds better than all of the rap records out now, which goes to show that nobody, not even Nas himself, can make a record this good anymore.

B000050FEN|5.0|Words can simply not describe Fincher's visual genius. Every scene in this movie, especially the crime scenes, are masterfully shot. Visually and aurally, this movie knocks the socks off any crime drama I've ever seen. The script is great- the chemistry between Mills and Somerset was intense, and amusing at times. Also, the seven deadly sins idea was incredible as well. Never have I seen a more impressive film, spare Fight Club (another one by Fincher, surprise surprise). This is great stuff, and might just require a second viewing. Supplemental material is good too. <br />-Dan
B00005JKJA|3.0|Many [people] have complained that the DVD of Mulholland DR. doesn't have chapter breaks and a director's commentary. <br />Well, it's intentional. David Lynch doesn't like Chapter breaks, so none of his DVDs have them. He wants you to sit down and watch the whole movie, from beginning to end.<br />The movie doesn't have a director's commentary, because Lynch wants you to figure out for yourself what the movie is about.
0451169514|5.0|Never have a I read a book that was so...real. King proves himself a master storyteller with \\"It\\", and upon reading the first few pages of \\"After the Storm\\" in the bookstore, I was hooked. Getting back to the realism factor, he weaves this story so seamlessly, creating charactors so real it seems as if your reading about yourself. What makes this story so haunting is not Georgies death within the first few pages, the final chapter \\"Ritual of Chud\\", or any other of Pennywise's occurences, but the way he writes the book. It is so involved and thorough and realistic and complete and wonderful, (as if these four terms could not be stressed enough). Words cannot do justice, do yourself a favor and pick it up, or dust off a copy of an old copy you might have.
6302548195|5.0|I first saw Arnold in a movie called Conan The Barbarian. I was little then, and I only caught glimpses of a few clips. A couple of my dad's friends rented it and watched it in our house. I wasn't impressed much then...until a few years later. <br />My first real exposure to Arnold was with the movie poster of Commando. He looked ruthless and cold and I frankly haven't ever seen that kind of a killer like determined image of anyone before. He looked like nothing could stand in his way once he started moving on. I watched Red Heat first and a few more movies of his and was very impressed with his muscular physique and started bodybuilding on the roof of my dad's house in earnest. <br />Later, one day, I met (now a close friend of mine) Shimul. He was Mr. Bangladesh (in the middleweight division), and he was training for the next contest. I had never seen a bodybuilder in person before and this 180lb and beautifully developed guy was the first amateur bodybuilder I met. He looked awesome to me (I was a 150 lb weakling then). When I told him of Arnold and his movies (I had no idea that Arnold was the best bodybuilder of all time then) he smiled and said, wait till you see the real Arnold in a movie called &quot;Pumping Iron&quot;. <br />The next day I borrowed it from him and watched it. When I saw the scene where he does the concentration curls with the dumbbells my eyes almost fell out of my sockets...his arms looked like balloons..like someone blew air into them and they were ready to explode! This guy was larger than life and it was only a video I was looking at. I became hooked to bodybuilding after that, and in my mind I have only one image (that of Arnold) when I aspire to change my own physique. I became a bigger fan after watching this movie because my respect of him as a bodybuilder grew after the initial introduction to the moviestar. <br />I think any bodybuilding fan or Arnold fan should have this movie<BR>in their collection. I recently was able to lay myhands on a Rhino version of the movie (in VHS format) from my university media library, and was able to make a personal copy of the movie. The print is very clear and the version is uncut. The one I watched in Bangladesh (where I lived before) wasn't very clear and complete. But this one is. I think it is sad that the movie has gone out of production as it is a great educational video for any aspiring bodybuilder or person with an intention to build a better physique.
B00005UW7V|4.0|This is a movie that everybody loves to hate. But I love it, for many of the reasons that others hate it.<br />People expecting your standard E.T. Spielberg movie are creeped out by some of the uncomfortable scenes: the flesh fair, the rivalry between Martin and David, the alternate creepy/cuddliness of David himself.<br />But most of the criticism comes from the Kubrickians upset with the corny Spielberg touches, particularly the ending. They would be happier with a pure, dark vision of the future that would have left David at the bottom of the ocean.<br />The conflict between the Spielberg/Kubrick visions and between the contrasting emotions that audiences feel however I believe is integral to the duality that David represents. David is both Pinocchio and real. He has emotions, and yet he is a pile of circuits. Do your eyes tear up when he is abandoned, do you feel compassion? Or are you repelled by David's creepy unnaturalism, the way the owner of the flesh fair is?<BR>Once created, does a robot that can love deserve respect, compassion, love in return, rights?<BR>That is the central question that the movie is asking, and there are no easy answers.<BR>Your reactions say as much about you as about the movie. <BR>Some, like myself, will feel torn between the two emotions and come away with an uncomfortable feeling that ultimately is deeply satisfying. <BR>If you go to the movies to make you think, there is no better movie made last year. This is a movie that will have you debating with your friends for hours over the meaning of existence, moviemaking techniques and the morality of advanced robotics. <BR>If you go to the movies to have all of the answers tied up in one, neat, tidy package, this movie will drive you nuts.<br />Regardless of how you feel about the story, the acting and the production values in this movie are first-rate. Haley Joel Osment is absolutely convincing as an android Pinocchio who is striving to be a real boy. He's downright creepy in momentsjust how fake he seems, and yet at others he is as real as any boy, playing to the heart of the Pinocchio/real duality that David represents (and the universal need to feel \\"special\\" and \\"unique\\" -- note that David loses hope momentarily when he sees dozens of other \\"Davids\\" shrinkwrapped for sale in one of the movie's most powerful scenes.) <br />The supporting cast, ranging from the everpresent \\"Teddy\\" -- The Jiminy Cricket character -- to William Hurt as the myopic robot designer, to Martin as the jealous brother, are dead-on convincing.<br />And Jude Law as Gigolo Joe almost steals the show as the lover model with a romantic streak.<br />This is one movie that will hold up and be talked about long after most of the detritus of 2001 (The Mummy Returns, etc.) will be put to the dust heap of history.<br />If you want a good movie where good and evil are easy to follow and understand, go watch Lord of the Rings.<BR>If you want a movie where the lines are blurred, where you never quite know which side you are supposed to be on, watch A.I.
B00005UW7V|4.0|If you are a fan of Spielbergs usual action packed fair you might find this movie too slow or too weird. I enjoyed this movie and found it thought provoking.<br />The movie is about a robot child substitute built with artificial intelligence that enables it to love and be loved by its human owners. The robot it turns out has an ego and  believes itself to be unique and like no other. The robot subsequently becomes emotionaly needy and neurotic. They created something that has the flaws that cause human pain and suffering.<br />With no programmed belief system, the robot developes its own after hearing the story of Pinnochio. It pursues the blue fairy, which it believes will make him into a real boy and thus worthy of his mothers love. <br />At this point in the movie, I realize that the robot is seriously flawed. Which is what I found so thought provoking. They created a robot to fulfill a human's need for a childs love but in so doing created a robot that feels the same pain it was supposed to relieve.
6304712936|4.0|The standard Amadeus DVD (a special extended edition with all the extras is on the way) is somewhat annoying given that this is a truly great movie. It is double-sided, and you have to flip it over about two-thirds of the way through, at a moment when you are totally engrossed in the story. The extras are also not up to par. <BR>The quality of the video and the sound however are superb.<br />As far as the movie itself, this is a timeless story of jealousy and genius with a truly memorable, career-making performance by F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. Through his eyes and ears, even a musical novice can truly appreciate Mozart's talent. Even the casual listener can sense the brilliance of Mozart's music versus the plodding ponderousness of the &quot;Salieri&quot; pieces.<br />The Mozart character himself, played by Tom Hulce, is annoying, particularly his laugh, but that only serves to reinforce our understanding of Salieri's suffering, to have his works overshadowed by a goofball genius.<br />The movie does have its slow parts, and I can't imagine wading through the 3 hr, 20 minute extended version which is due out soon, but I expect I will.<br />Enjoy!
B000002U9E|5.0|This is largely considered to be Bush's chef d'oeuvre by fans &amp; critics alike (acknowledged even by Q Magazine &amp; Rolling Stone as one of the most essential albums to purchase) &amp; it's easy to see why.  Returning to the fore after a 3 year hiatus (all of Bush's albums up until 1982 were released consecutive years since '78), the break has done Bush good, as she delivers a very original &amp; brilliant thematic piece which is driven by themes of nature, love &amp; religion &amp; produced using majestic dark strings &amp; heavy drum programming.  The opener is one of the most devastatingly brilliant songs ever, Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God), whihc is powerfully evocative &amp; moving.  The remaining singles off the album are all quirky themes but brilliantly catchy. Cloudbusting's persistent string loop, rolling drum &amp; cacaphonic chorus is a song about making rain with her father.  Triumphant.  While The Hounds of Love jump starts along to high-pitched ''do-do-dos'' &amp; an anxiously happy vocal by Kate.  The gem in the album is The Big Sky, a thunderously joyous &amp; irreverent song about cloud shapes &amp; love.  The drums rattle along &amp; the experimental voices make this a truly joyous song that you feel yourself sink your teeth into.  The 2nd part of the album becomes darker &amp; broodier, but by no means less mesmerising.  The standout tracks are Under The Ice &amp; Waking The Witch, again driven by dark strings &amp; vocals, the former evoking scenes from The Omen II in my head &amp; the latter, scenes from Arthur Miller's Crucible.  Overall it is a dark but uplifting album, with little room for weakness, as Kate's self-written, performed &amp; produced opus capitalises her career &amp; influence.  17 years later &amp; it still sounds incredibly fresh &amp; challenging.
B000002NBY|5.0|The only thing I have to say is, what a great album! Truly Paul Simon's best work!   I hadn't heard any of Paul's music or knew who he was until my parents got out their 'Graceland' CD.  Once I heard 'The Boy in the Bubble,' I was hooked on this album.
6304602979|3.0|I love Christian Slater-so I actually like him in anything. But if your looking for a great movie pass this one by. It is a good rent. I wouldn't buy it. If you love love stories then this might fill your afternoon. Not a must see but a cute movie.
B000001E18|5.0|This album is a travelogue, starting with Bono singing &quot;and I have no compass, and I have no map, and I have no reasons, no reasons to get back&quot; on the title track and ending with &quot;The Wanderer.&quot;  It's a chronicle of technological obsession (&quot;you're coming to me from outer space,&quot; &quot;through the light projected he can see himself up close&quot;).  Edge paints the dark underbelly of fame in &quot;Numb,&quot; Adam bounces his bass around for a jolly jaunt on &quot;Some Days Are Better Than Others,&quot; and Bono confesses to difficulties with his father by talking Biblical allegory in &quot;The First Time.&quot;  And, oh yeah, let's not forget the wasted urban landscape of &quot;Stay,&quot; &quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay,&quot; and &quot;Dirty Day,&quot; among others.  Does this sound like a crazy mix to toss together in an album?  Yet, somehow it works out.  As Bono says along the way, &quot;you've got a head full of traffic.&quot;  Yes, we do, and thank you.
B00004XPPK|5.0|The always stunning Rita Hayworth stars as Gilda, the ultimate femme fatale in this film noir classic. She's a woman who uses her womanly charms in a manly way: to manipulate and gain power, creating drama for everyone, including herself. She's her own worst enemy, and all because... well, you'll have to watch and find out. I won't be so kind as to spoil the ending for you (see some of the other reviews for that), but I will agree with others in saying it's an unsatisfying cop-out. It doesn't matter, though. The first hour&40 make this DEFINITELY worth watching.<br />To the previous reviewer who called this film misogynistic: say what? Gilda's more manly than any of the actual males in this movie, who may or may not be gay. Besides, how can one female's actions stand for females as a whole? Since there are no other women protagonists in this diegesis to compare Gilda with, that reading rests on a faulty basis.
6305327084|5.0|&quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; is a movie that might have escaped your eyes, and unfortunately, that's a shame. For those of you who haven't seen it, you're missing one of the best films ever to be released in the 1990s, and with an ensemble -- yet not mega -- cast, the basic plot is rendered beautifully.<br />Revolving around a bunch of twentysomething friends awaiting their 10-year high school reunion, Beautiful Girls never makes us feel pity. Taking place in a small New England town during the winter, the characters never offer apologies for sticking around their bleak city streets. To them, it doesn't matter that they're plowing snow, cutting hair, or tending bar. The fact remains that the town is their home, and only Willy, Tim Hutton's character, is the &quot;outsider&quot; now. He's a piano-player who has returned from his big-city &quot;life&quot; to attend the reunion with his old pals.<br />But it's the title of the movie that gives it its life. When Uma Therman comes walking into the picture, everything changes. You see, each man has a &quot;beautiful girl&quot; in his life that affects him. For Matt Dillon's &quot;Birdie,&quot; it's Mira Sirvino (Sharon, girlfriend) AND the delicious (but married) former high school girlfriend Lauren Holly (Darien). For Michael Rapaport (Paul), Martha Plimpton (Jan) is his main squeeze, but he's enamored with supermodels, as evidenced by his collection of centerfolds on his wall and his dog, &quot;Elle MacPherson.&quot; To him, beautiful girls not only represent life -- they give it. In Mo's case (Noah Emmerich), he's the married one, dedicated to his wife and kids. As for Kev (Max Perlich), well, he's got his own issues. But Willie presents the most entertaining dialogue with his &quot;girls.&quot; He's got his steady lawyer girlfriend Tracy (Annabeth Gish) coming into town, much to the dismay of the next-door neighbor, Marty, played with unabashed gusto by the beautiful Natalie Portman. Marty's age difference presents thereal challenge to Willie, but the relationship is almost adult. Their dialogue is perhaps the best thing about the movie, and the viewer will actually come to realize why Willie is so infatuated with this 13-year-old &quot;beautiful girl.&quot; Portman's character has a way of connecting with the male audience that needs to be seen.<br />But Uma Therman's Andera is actually the girl that comes and makes sense of each man's life. A big-city advertising exec, Andera can drink whiskey with the best of 'em, turn on the charm, and offer up wisdom and a helping hand to each of the guys. Her presence awakens the realization of every man in the movie that the best thing about their beautiful girls is the simple things. Although she seems to be &quot;the perfect girl,&quot; she makes the guys come to realize that other men see their women in exactly the same light. She represents all the things that the men simply can't see in their beautiful girls. If they look more closely, it's all there.<br />Rosie O'Donnell makes a wonderful appearance in the movie as well, but Natalie Portman's Marty is the real reason to watch this one. She is simply sensational. <br />A great story with witty one-liners and some stuff that can make you shed a tear, &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; won't easily be forgotten.
0156907399|5.0|absolutely stunning literature, i've read some great books, by some great authors (nabokov, proust, fitzgerald, hemingway, dickens, faulkner, dreiser, thoreau, joyce) and this is definetly a standout among the pack. it definetly deserves its place in the canon and a place on your &quot;read books rack&quot; if you are any kind of serious literati or academic. It probes deeply human and profound topics; man's relation to nature and time, the meaning of life, gender issues, relationships. And most of all it is absolutly beautiful prose. the second section, time passes, is probably the most beautiful literature i have ever had the pleasure of. pick this one up!
B00005JKES|4.0|Well this DVD box set has been a long time coming, but it was absolutely worth the wait. Box design, picture quality, sound, features all brilliant - I especially like the cast interviews and episode features which include deleted scenes and commentaries. The episode introductions by the log lady are, well, 'out there..' and are, therefore, perfect!! If you are an Aussie Peaks fan, and your DVD player is for all regions, you have nothing to fear with purchasing this version (I've checked with Australian distributors and they don't know when the box set will be released in Australia, so aside from the ...exchange rate my feeling is 'why wait?') My only critique would be the size and colour of the text font, which is a little hard on the eyes. Otherwise, bring on the second box set! Please. Quickly.
B0000025F7|5.0|Michael Jackson's first solo studio album Off The Wall is arguably his best album.  This album contains many of his hits such as Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, ( the song which Chris Tucker performs in Rush Hour 2---`The man destroying a classic!\\" ), Rock With You, Off The Wall, Working Day &amp; Night, Girlfriend.  The lp is short and to the point.  Very sweet and legendary.  Rock With You is also my all-time favorite Michael Jackson song so this album is extra special.  This album is a little more midtempo to ballad type songs and less upbeat than Thriller but if you like Michael Jackson you will surely enjoy it.   If you don't have this album I suggest you buy it quickly.
B000002IJL|5.0|Does anyone know how I could get my hands on the actual score or the theme of this movie?  It is the quieter symphonic music that plays in the beginning and throughout parts of the movie.
B000001ESP|5.0|If you only own one Rush CD (how could you only own one?) this should be it.  Don't bother with compilations, Rush selections are made to be heard one after another in each album.  Moving Pictures is arguably, their best CD.<br />The best thing about this CD is that you can listen to it over and over again (all the way through) and hardly get tired of it.  It's commercial success has nothing to do with the reasons why you should own this CD, it's MUSICAL Rock at it's best.  Alex, Neal and Geddy are among the best at their positions (Neal may be the best rock drummer ever) and they show it all off here.
B00004Z459|3.0|This CD is good, solid rock/rap.  I'm a rock/rap fan, and this CD is a good CD.  But its being WAY overplayed, and is has a few problems.  <BR>   First(and worst), all the songs sound EXACTLY the same.  Some have a little more singing than rapping, most are almost all rap, and they sound identical, musically and lyrically.  They usually start out soft, get all hard all of a sudden, the lead singer screams, then it gets soft and the rapper starts his thing.  If you heard their songs on the radio or [mainstream television]... then you know Linkin Park.  The CD has no surprises, and sometimes you'll get confused which line is in which song.  The lyrics are all angry love songs and stuff, and they're usually a little profound and fun to say, but nothing new.  Crawling is the only song that sounds at all different from the others, and not much.  On the bright side, these songs, while all the same, aren't all that bad.  The lyrics sound cool, and you can sing along to the music.  Depending on who you are, you might be able to relate to the lyrics.  So as I said before, its a solid CD, probably worth [money] or so, but its not what everyone thinks it is.  Its just another CD.
0452282152|4.0|What an enjoyable story about the artist Vermeer from a young girl's viewpoint.  Tracy Chevalier's novel was such a pleasantly surprising adaptation of what might have happened between an artist and his muse.  I added this book to my list of recommendations, especially for teen readers.
B00000JCB2|4.0|First of all, if you liked 3DB, you probably wont like this as much, because its more rap-oriented, and less normal hard rock.  Also, this CD sounds a little more normal than 3DB.  It has a different sound.  But if you're like me, you weren't too crazy about 3DB and figure its the music that matters, not whether the band raps or not.  And then you should like this CD.<br />  The best thing about this CD is that it has all good songs.  Some people say it only has 4 or 5 good songs, but they're not listening.  If you liked Nookie and Breakstuff, then there shouldnt be any problems about the rest of the CD, and Im not sure what everyone keeps complaining about.  The other songs are fine.  Its a nice mix of rock and rap, and even though there are a whole lot of rap/rock groups lately, I think Bizkit is one of the better ones.  They have variety in their songs, which I like. They have some angry songs like Breakstuff, some songs that are about bad love relationships like Linkin Park always does, some songs that you can just headbang to(especially Trust), and some songs that are just sort of starting and finishing the CD.  It has a lot of variety, but the songs are enough alike that, whatever anyone else thinks, you can like them all and not just the ones on MTV. It finishes off with a serious soft song, the outro, and a funny thing with some guy swearing about how much pop bands [stink].  It has good songs, its not too short, and basically this CD is for anyone who likes rock/rap.  If only the Chocolate Starfish could have been as good.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Blink 182 has released only one album I find better than this, Take Off Your Pants And Jacket. The only other album that beats this is J To Tha LO, Jennifer LOpez. Anyhow, this album consists of:(10's best)<br />  Dumpweed-9.5 great start off song, punk<BR>  Don't Leave Me-10 rock, fast song, only 2 min.<BR>  Aliens Exist-10 obviously serious, that's completely Tom's lyrics.

0064430227|5.0|I loved to read as a child, and my uncle provided me with so many wonderful books... but somehow, he missed this one.  I never heard of it until a friend of mine bought this book for my son.  So at age 32, I experienced Harold and the Purple Crayon for the time.  What a wonderful story!  Harold takes his purple crayon and draws himself many different scenes, from a trip across the ocean to a balloon ride to a walk in the city.  Crockett Johnson keeps the story moving at a fast but easy pace, and as a result it flows very nicely.  My son has just turned three and he is starting to really get into it.  This one is sure to be one of your children's favorite books.
B00005S8FC|5.0|Although I have little knowledge of this particular genre of music, I can say the cool, airy mood of his album makes it the primer for the downtempo/chill novice. Sample &amp; enjoy.
B00005ASGG|4.0|John Ford is to the American Western what Akira Kurosawa is to the Japanese Samurai flick.  He takes a genre ripe with stereotypes and cheap melodrama and turns it inside out.  He does not do this so much by challenging the stereotypes, but instead by finding their soul.<br />\\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" deals a traditional duel, the intellectual versus the strong man.  This duel is fought on multiple levels, not just between Ransom Stoddard and Liberty Valance, but also between Ransom Stoddard and Tom Doniphon.  Brain vs. Brawn, who will save the town?  Who will win the girl?  The answers are surprising.<br />This is a fairly bare-bones DVD.  The black and white is crisp.  Sound is available in original Mono or an updated 5.1 Stereo.  For the price, I would have liked a more robust presentation.  This classic film certainly deserves it.<br />Minus a star for the DVD,  otherwise \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" is one of the best entries in the Western genre.
B000024C7W|5.0|Just to set the record straight, the film was indeed released - I am one of those few (it seems) who saw it. As an independent documentary film it wasn't guaranteed wide screening, despite Stevie Wonder's magnificent soundtrack behind it, but it was a fascinating look at some dramatic research on the consciousness of plants (yes, Virginia, they know who you are and what you do).<br />Ah, yes, the soundtrack. I first bought this for a girlfriend who opened it in front of me - bless Stevie, the record (sorry, I know this is a CD review) was scented with roses. That's what the music, book and film are about, really, releasing the joy our brothers and sisters the plants give us.<br />The double CD is very much a soundtrack - a number of the tracks are instrumental, so if you're looking for earlier Stevie ala &quot;Talking Book&quot; or &quot;Hotter Than July&quot;, this won't quite make it. The big hit from this album, &quot;Send One Your Love&quot; is a ballad, and the vocal tracks mostly follow this style. There are a few track slightly more upbeat but nothing along the lines of &quot;Jammin'&quot; or &quot;Superstition&quot; if that's what you're looking for. Instead of funky, think elegant, romantic, exquisite. This album is best taken at its word - it is a journey through the secret life of plants. A mystical journey of love and power whose nature is both alien to us and an intrical part of our everyday world. If your main squeeze has horticultural leanings and enjoys the &quot;Songs In The Key Of Life/Talking Book era Stevie Wonder, you've found yourself a winner. And for bonus points, buy the fascinating book by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird. Heck, buy both for yourself and read the book while listening to Stevie lay it down for you. You won't be disappointed.<br />Side note: Stevie plays just about all the instruments on this album, so you're really getting 100% Wonder on this one.
0553106635|5.0|Really liked all 3 books - read them back to back ! Great gripping Fantasy with plenty of suprises and you're never quite sure how each chapter is going to end !
B00005T30L|2.0|First, my apologies to all that found some sense of ownership in these characters or their deeds.  Personally I found Enid to be despondent wreck, hell bent on lambasting others for their perceived injustices (read: success).  The parade of foil characters that attempted to sharply contrast her persona only reinforced my belief that not only was she clueless and without direction, but that she was simply melnacholy because she did not fit in.  Her acerbic demeanor, lack of depth or any altruistic conviction only proved that she wasn't motivated by a cause or struggle.  My belief is that her perpetual effort to rub popular culture the wrong way was in some way a combative response to not fitting in.  On that level this work was a mild success. Just don't get confused, acting out is not high art.   This piece was a prime example of both the director and the protagonist being rebels without a cause...or clue.
B0000203Y5|5.0|So far as I can tell this was the best way to show <BR>how bossa is born...it's all in those eyes,<BR>in this great voices, in those hands on piano..<BR>a true masterpiece from a director who's speaking in <BR>the language of film.
B000063DGC|5.0|I love this album, have owned all three versions commited to CD, and this is the one to own.  One important note: this has the same bass and drum tracks it has always had, unlike the recent rerecording done to Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman.  It is difficult to say something about this album that hasn't been said already, but if you love Ozzy and Randy, then you should own this already.  While all of the tracks are awesome, the standouts are Suicide Solution with an amazing guitar solo and Paranoid, where Randy makes Tony Iommi sound like a beginner guitar player (I do enjoy the Sabbath version, but this one is sooooo much better).  Enjoy this piece of history!!!
B0000524CY|4.0|Let me just say that i loved this movie. Although made 9 years before i was born, i enjoyed it greatly.<br />However, there is no way that i thought it was the scariest movie of all time. It might have been because of all the &quot;shock/startle&quot; horror movie out these days, or possibly because i had read the book before seeing it. I made sure that i watched it after dark alone for maximum effect, but it failed to scare me at all. If any thing, i found some of the scenes rather humerous (such as the &quot;walking&quot; down the steps) but that might just be my strange sense of humour.<br />Aside from this though, it is a great movie. My best advice is watch it yourself and make up your own mind on it. After all, its been nearly 30 years since it was first released and for it to survive that long, it surely must be considered a classic.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Well, she took the wrong turn and was borne down Mulholland drive - possibly meeting Margot Kidder on her way back from LAX.<br />That's more or less how this panther of a movie slowly creeps along. It's one of those wonderful Hollywood exposes, crafted by the mind of David Lynch although it does have a smattering of \\"Last Year At Marienbad\\" {Alain Resnais}, \\"Whatever happened to Baby Jane\\", as well as heaps of \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" and \\"Laura\\"and \\"Day of the Locust\\" as well as quite a lashing of \\"Persona\\". I'm not sure if all of this works - BUT elfin Naomi Watts [brilliant!!!] as les enfant in purgatory [Boy does she learn a lot about Tinseltown!], stunning Laura Harring as the sultry amnesiac Rita, Ann Miller [spectacular] as Coco, and barely used [but what a face!] - Robert Forster. Favourite moments - the hitman and the hit gone wrong - now how many times does that happen in this town? AND the golfclub on the windshield sequence. AND those horrible all night diners on Sunset......<br />\\"Don't Speak!\\" - just sit back and enjoy this nightmare!<br />Now what's with the Kim Novak gray suit [Vertigo]?<br />Oh, and Mr. Lynch I'm ready for my close-up.<br />{.....for 'something quite different' see \\"Flypaper\\" - this one makes SO much more sense ........ except for that rather odd opening sequence, but worthy to be double-billed with the above ........}
B00005221L|3.0|I will attend to this dismal DVD production in a moment.But first I would like to say that Predator wins \\"Best Arnie movie\\" hands down. Also probably the greatest \\"Mans movie\\" ever created.<br />Now come on guys, seriously. How much testoserone is in this movie? Not only is the concept of an out of space creature hunting and skinning alive an elite bunch of toughguys macho, but look at the portfolios of the cast. You've got Arnie (The Terminator) himself, Carl (Apollo Creed) weathers, Jesse (the Governor) Ventura, Bill (eat green berets for breakfast) Duke, Sonny (big in-mate from \\"Lock up\\") Landham and 3 other flash-in-the pan little runts who should've been killed off alot sooner than they did (or were'nt?). All you needed was Dolph Lundgren to play \\"poncho\\", Sly stallone to play \\"Hawkins\\" and Arancha Sanchez-Vicario to play \\"Anna\\" and i doubt you would've had an ounce of bodyfat in the entire movie.<br />Even though the concept was original and was probably thought up by by John McTiernan's 10 year old son after a 5 second brain storm. It still entertains and scares the life out of me every time (week) I watch it. And after all, that's why we watch movies isn't it? (to all you tough film critics out there)<BR>But let's face it, with movies such as Superman, Jaws and Aliens rceiving such huge accolades, you would have to say that on some occasions original, can be the best.<br />I think the special effects were ahead of it's time, the location in which it was filmed was spot-on and had an \\"Apocolyps Now\\" resemblence to it. With the music and soundtrack added alot of excitement and fear to the film.<br />As for the transformation to DVD, all i have to say is       FOX, LIFT YOUR GAME! The quality and standard is extreamly poor, making a top-notch Action film look dodgey and cheap. The biggest insult is that it comes with NO ADDED FEATURES WHATSOEVER!!! No interviews, no deleted scenes, no documentary and definantly no alternative ending! I think Dumb & Dumber had more added features than Predator! Can you believe it?<br />The only reason i give this DVD 3 stars is because i love this movie so much! After watching Arnies movies of late such as \\"The 6th day\\" and \\"End of days\\", i think i know why.                It's a bit sad!
B00005RFQ5|5.0|In regard to the remarks of \\"a music fan in Chicago\\": The idea that Prince doesn't promote any one religion may appeal to you, but in the very songs to which you refer (The Cross\\" and \\"Lovesexy\\") there are explicit refrences to Jesus Christ as Lord. Prince may draw ideas and inspiration from Eastern religions ... or maybe he just borrows elements of the music, who knows, but he has always made explicit references to Jesus Christ. Other religions may claim Jesus as this or that, but Christ rather strongly symbolizes Christianity, to my mind.
B0000636UN|5.0|Why is it that I seem to enjoy the songs that the other reviewers seem to glaze by.  This album has a handful of up-tempo toe-tapping tunes including Soak up the Sun and Steve McQueen, but after picking this Cd up last week, it's some of the less trendy, manufactured, whatever you want to call it tunes that have got me setting the cd player on the repeat mode.  I am loving Weather Channel, Abeliene (with the chunky Dixie Chick), and C'mon C'mon.  The girl is a national treasure and at 40 is still the best thing out there.
B00004SCX6|2.0|I'm not a really fan of Britney, but I like her music. It is okay! A friend of mine bougth this CD for me, it has an Extra Track called \\"Girl In THe Mirror!\\" That song is not very good, but it's okay. The  other song I don't like is the title track, and I also don't like Dear Diary. Britney (Of Course!) wrote this song, it says so in her booklet. All of the other songs are good, but When Your Eyes Say It , doesn't make sence. I used to not like that song but now I do even tho the title doesn't make sence. The reason why I gave off 3 Stars is because of the songs Girl In The Mirror (On The European Versionz, which I have!), Title Track and Dear Diary. That is why I gave off 3 stars... other than that Britney did a great job on this album. <br />My favorite songs are, Stronger, Lucky, and Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know*  <BR>Good luck, Britney!*!...
6305327041|5.0|Try to watch any part of this film and not smile (then maybe you can eat only one potato chip). This is a film you can really relax with, and not take seriously. It is fascinating, ingenious and extremely funny, in a surrealistic and bizarre sort of way. This is an unusual film, and a lot of fun. No matter how many times I watch it, it's great every time. Cameos from a lot of stars, including Madonna, Antonio Banderas, and Quentin Tarantino! Tim Roth is amazing.
B00005ASOC|5.0|FINDING FORRESTER is a movie about 16-year-old Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown), a high school basketball star who has a secret passion, and a talent, for writing.  When he is dared to go into an apartment of a mysterious isolated man (Sean Connery), he finds out who he really is, an award-winning and well-known author of a book Jamal is reading in school.  This movie is witty, highly entertaining, and even realistic.  This movie seems a bit long at times, but every minute is worth it.
0345448898|3.0|Pullman has a very fertile imagination, which has allowed him to populate these books with many unforgettable characters and ideas.  Unfortunately, the pacing of the books is very uneven.  There are some points (e.g. the ends of both the first and second books) that are just too frenetic, where what should have been a whole chapter gets condensed down to a single page in what seems like a rush to finish the volume.  There are other points (most of the third book) where the plot drags intolerably.  A little editing could have helped a lot in producing a more readable series.<br />The other problem I have with the series is its increasingly allegorical storyline.  It's not really noticeable in the first book, then starts to appear in the second and dominates the third.  Quite honestly, I found the increasingly anti-religious tone pretty tiresome.  Brust and Zelazny did a much better job in _To Reign in Hell_, which should also appeal to younger readers, and there are other examples of the same theme being handled better as well.<br />In a similar vein, I was personally rather pleased to see same-sex relationships (among angels, no less) treated as something normal and unremarkable, but others might find that same treatment offensive.  I have to wonder who these books are written for.  The apparent young-reader audience is probably not ready for the religious and other themes, while their treatment is too sophomoric for adult readers.  I think Pullman would have done well to eschew some of the polemics and concentrate on telling a good story - which he's very capable of doing.<br />I'd like to recommend these books because of their sheer imaginative creativity, but due to these other failings I find it impossible to do so.  There are worse books out there, to be sure, but there are just as certainly better ones.
0679879269|5.0|This book is one of the best young adult books i have ever read.<BR>Lyra and her companions travel through diffrent worlds to make a wonderful end to the series. The best part about this book is that it doesn't treat the christian religion with too much respect. This book gives a new view to god and the kingdom of heaven as a source for imaginitive writing rather than too much reverence.
B0000636UN|3.0|I have listened to Sheryl Crow ever since her first album, but I have to say I am not particularly impressed by this. I have always enjoyed her lyrics, and that remains (with the exception of the title track due to it's use of only two words, c'mon and c'mon.), but her music fails to impress me as it once did. Unfortunatly, all of it is starting to sound the same. Yeah, I like it, but it's not interesting and it's beginning to be too much of a good thing. &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; reminds me of countless other songs. (&quot;Sweet Roslyn&quot; anyone?) <BR>I really like &quot;Weather Channel&quot; and the duets are nice. But I guess what I'm trying to say is I'd like the music I listen to to evolve. If you like Sheryl Crow, it's a good album not a great album and I wouldn't say it offers any more than her second and third albums have already.
B000021Y77|5.0|Both cast and script were perfect. The movie kept you on the edge of your seat, not knowing what to expect-from any of the three separate endings. I have my favorite ending but wont spoil the movie by telling which.<br />Lola and Manni...two typical young people in a relationship, sucked into something bigger than the both of them. During the drama you watch their relationship change. Lola's glass-breaking shriek was the thing that drove me to the movie from the previews. I wanted to see what that was all about and I did. Stopping time and changing events. It was all good.<br />Great Sunday-go-to-the-movies flick.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I would say that this CD truimps Oops...I Did It Again in terms of lyrics (a little more mature), song variety, and vocal clarity.  Her style is slightly different; she still has her Max Martin songs, but she also has some more mature songs that older fans (around her age) can relate to.  Her sound is still pop, but this album is sprinkled with R&B and rock. I usually listen to this CD all the way through.  However, I think she sang better on the other CDs, in terms of her voice having more substance, style and variety in sound.  At first I thought her vocals were better here than on the previous albums because they were clearer.  However, though her vocals were clearer here, they also were a little more bland/generic sounding sometimes than on her past 2 albums.     This CD is all upbeat songs with 1 or 2 slow songs.  I like to listen to most of the songs each time I listen to the album.    1. I'm A Slave 4 U--Great start!  This first single is much different from anything that Britney previously recorded.  It is produced by The Neptunes, and it is a club-banger.  Lots of people who do not like Britney even like the song. 4/5    2. Overprotected--Cool beat.  This is not the version that she released as a single in the U.S; it has a different beat. 4/5    3. Lonely--She is practically talking instead of singing on this song, but it works.  She even sorta has a rap part that is cool. She co-wrote this.  This is one of the songs that I instantly liked. 5/5    4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman--The only \\"real\\" ballad on the album.  It is also the theme song of her movie \\"Crossroads.\\"  This is definitely one of her best songs.  She has very good vocals on this track. This is my favorite song on the album. 5/5    5. Boys--Another track produced by the Neptunes.  At first I didn't care for it too much, but it grew on me.  It sort of has an old school hip-hop/R&B beat. 3/5    6. Anticipating--co-written by Britney.  This song is about her going out clubbing and having funwith her friends; it has a cool disco-like beat. 4/5    7. I Love Rock N Roll--A remake of Joan Jett's song.  I don't know what the original sounds like, but I like this song. 4/5    8. Cinderella--This is one of my favorites.  Sounds like it has a Euro-dance beat. 5/5    9.Let Me Be--co-written by Britney.  This song was on the \\"On The Line\\" soundtrack. Brit says that an argument with Justin inspired this song; it is about her telling him to trust her because she knows what she is doing. 5/5    10. Bombastic Love--I like this song, but she sort of sounds a little bit like a kid on it. I heard she didn't even want it on the album, but her record label liked it. 4/5    11.That's Where You Take Me--Co-written by Britney.  I consider this song a slow song because of the way she sings it, but the beat behind it gets a little fast on the choruses.  It is a sweet song that sounds like it was written for Justin. It is one of my favorites. 5/5    12. What It's Like To Be Me--written by Justin and Wade(her choreographer). Has a different sound; it stands out from the others. Justin does background vocals and a beat box.  Sounds good! 5/5
6305807086|3.0|A bit to weird and out of character for all the actors that played in it. I think it was a break away from their usually \\"GOOD\\" performances.<br />The premise of the movie was OKAY from a totally creative standpoint. I mean, I can't imagine it being a book...so a movie is what it would have to be.<br />The portal thing was OLD the twist were bizarre and the outcome plan old WEIRD.<br />Just a bit to dark for my taste
B00005JKQX|3.0|Definitely an overrated movie. I almost walked out during the first 10 minutes or so. Bad acting and cliche situations. At its worst when he has his 'brilliant' idea at university which is demonstrated by the girl in the red dress. But luckily it got a little better after that. Russell Crowe's excellent acting compensated for a lot. He plays a realistic over-focused nerd, although in my experience, people like that are not as good as self-evaluation (the silly-old-me routine) as this character seems to be. The casting for his wife is not very well done. She is just too beautiful for him. And although miracles do happen, I kept wondering what she saw in him.<BR>On the whole, not a waste of money, but not a must-see.
B00003CXN4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I like a hardcore cop movie when I can get my hands on one. It had unexpected turns and the surprising good guys. I was never REALLY sure about whose side to be on. The war on drugs is a topic that can always be written about as it's never ending and there are always new twist on who they are used to demoralize the nation...the WORLD.<br />Watch only when you have the time to concentrate...if not you will have to watch it again and again to get what you missed...but even then, it's worth a repeat viewing.<br />Michael Douglas was very believable as a DAD EMERGING FROM THE BURST BUBBLE that once surrounded his kids.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Great film! Original images are rare in the movie-world, but were abundant in this film. The story is thin of course and plenty melodramatic, but you can't let that spoil your fun! I usually don't like musicals, but somehow that dislike did not apply here. I loved every minute of it.
B000002J1B|4.0|This album is just mind-blowing, for the most part. For me the climax of Gates is not Soon but Patrick's and Steve's soloing before it. Stunning. And Sound Chaser is crazier than it sounds, you'll love it. To Be Over, well, I suppose it's placed well after the chaos. Alan's drumming is truly horrid on the first half of the song though, it totally ruins what could have been a Yes classic.<br />Get it, for me it's the last great Yes album before Magnification (for all you Moody Blues fans this is a comeback album, not the boring piffle they call Strange Times).
B00005NWM3|1.0|no mater what anybody says,this album just isn't good.mediocre at best absolute dirge at worst,whichever way you look at it it still doesn't make for good listening.what nickleback and their kin are doing right now is pushing back american rock way back into the springsteen era.say what you want to say about nu-metal but its infinatly more fun this sorry bunch....
B000050AMJ|4.0|Its a good album. Heavy in most occasions. Melodic in some occasions. The first song, feel good hit of the summer, will really catch your attention and the second, lost art of keeping a secret, will make you want to listen to the whole album to make sure you dont miss anything QOTSA has to offer. This is an album full of rock, recommended to anyone with rock tendencies.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I think it's interesting that so many reviewers said this movie isn't deep or thought-provoking. Although it is truly romantic and hilarious -- and a tribute to so many great old musicals by someone who obviously loves them -- it is also quite thought-provoking story used to explore a wealth of themes. One friend saw the federation protecting outdated dancing styles as a metaphor for the Catholic Church! Another was reminded of &quot;Dead Poet's Society&quot; and its critical look at education. Don't be afraid to live life outside the box. <br />I admired this director's &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; but this is my favorite of his trilogy.
0792843584|1.0|Somewhere, buried in the mishmash was a passably decent western. Good luck finding it.<br />Part Fiddler on the Roof, part Dr. Zhivago (the number one bad guy even *dresses* like a ... commissar!) part How the West Was Won, part bad 70s Kristoffersen as Actor, part soft-core porn, oh man, it has the worst of everything, including unbelievably bad \\"editing\\" that has one scene of Kris throwing a stick of dynamite at a bunch of peasent women carrying rifles! (I swear to god it's in there). It was an OK movie up to the point where the Russian/Polish/German/who knows peasantry decides to fight back, at which point it becomes completely incomprehensible. The whole big \\"fight\\" scene is probably the worst mess ever filmed. <br />Masterpiece? You guys must have seen a different cut than I did because there was nothing even remotely close to being masterful in the entire movie. If it had concentrated on why a wealthy Harvard Graduate became a slumming county sheriff in the middle of nowhere it might have been interesting. But we get no clues as to why Kris heads West. And this after the interminable Harvard Graduation scenes!...<br />Robert St. James<BR>Albany, Oregon.
B000002UAO|5.0|I love the Beatles, and this is truly one of my favorite albums of theirs. This one is easily in the top five. This is when they Beatles truly became real musicians. Most of their fans stood with them. With rockers, such as &quot;Drive My Car&quot; and &quot;What Goes On,&quot; and great ballads, such as &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown&quot; and &quot;Michelle.&quot; This is a solid album with one of the best songs that John ever did, &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; which is now desecrated as the theme song for NBC's horrid show, &quot;Providence.&quot; I give &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; five stars.
0140386335|5.0|If you rate Harry Potter 10, then The Neverending Story is 1,000! <br />I recommend this book not only to young people but also to all business men and women. Read this book, and think about what you've been doing \\"there\\" once again.
B000001Y79|4.0|\\"Tragic Kingdom\\" is an excellent album with great songs. I guess you would call this \\"Ska\\" music, but it's just great alternative rock. Gwen Stefani has a great voice, but it can get annoying at some points. This is also the last album they did with Greg Stefani (the founding member) before he left the band. The albums after \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" gradually get worse. \\"Return of Saturn\\" is a contender for this one, but \\"Rock Steady\\" just plain [stinks]. If you buy this and like it I suggest that you get the debut album, \\"NO DOUBT.\\"<br />You know that some bands get worse with age, No Doubt is one of them. Don't buy \\"Rock Steady.\\" Instead, get \\"Tragic Kingdom.\\" You'll thank me. I give \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" four stars because Gwen is so annoying. They need a new singer that won't hog all the fame. Let Gwen do her horrid duets with Eve and Moby. Make No Doubt a real band again. Ditch Gwen.
B00005JKED|1.0|This was not a good film.  One questions whether the folks at the Academy even bothered to watch this film before they voted on the award for Denzel (who by the way didn't do any better a job with his acting in this film than you would expect from the average actor).  If you have not seen it, do so, for it will expose to you the fact that these awards were politically motivated, there really can be no other option...and you will understand after you see this...for it was not talent which earned any awards here.  I really do like Denzel in most film, just not this one....and if you see it...I am willing to bet...you will agree!
0440219078|3.0|I think I missed a chapter or something because it was confusing.<BR>It was about Jonas, a 12 year old boy, who,with the rest of his classmates, gets assigned a job.  His is to keep all the memories of the world, and the whole community doesn't feel a thing.  Everything the people do, is routine.  They do the samething everyday.  Any person, baby to elder, will get \\"released\\" from the community if they did not meet the towns expectations.  One day Jonas watches a baby being \\"released\\" then he decides to run away from his community with a two year old named Gaberail to a different town.  It also comes with a very weird ending.  I wouldn't recommend this book to people who like excitement.
B000063DFN|5.0|Having been around for nearly a decade by this time, Iron Maiden's sound was developing from their early punk-styled streetwise songs to complex masterpieces. The Number Of The Beast saw the beginning of this change. The band's 1984 release, Powerslave, was the moment where their new style shined it brightest.<br />Like the previous release, 1983's Piece Of Mind, this album has the classic, and most likely the best, Iron Maiden lineup. Bruce \\"The Air Raid\\" Dickinson takes the forefront and vocals and sings with raw energy and power while having refined his ability over the last two albums. Guitarists Adrian Smith and Dave Murray play the harmonies that are so tight it's hard to imagine how they pull it off. They also let off some blazing solos when the time comes. As always, bassist and main lyricist Steve Harris lets himself be heard in the low end as he pounds, slaps and jams with the rhythm of Nicko McBrain, whose drumming is masterful and incredible.<br />The album starts off with the classic Aces High. The song starts a little slowly but once the harmony and rhythm kicks in, you know your time has come. The song is fast paced; hard, heavy and powerful with some great guitar work and a showcase of Dickinson's vocal refinement. Next comes another classic and live favorite: 2 Minutes To Midnight. Slower than the previous song, the guitars are very tight while the rhythm is powerful as Dickinson sings away with perfection. Next is Losfer Words (Big Orra), which is one of the 4 instrumentals that Iron Maiden has recorded in their career. A very cool song, the guitars shine, the bass is all over the place and the drumming is solid and consistent. Flash Of The Blade comes next and this is an awesome song about fighting and being a swordsman. The opening guitar is pretty interesting but blows into a hard song that rocks until its over. Not much to say about this song except awesome. <br />Another song about fighting, The Duellists follows up. It is basically a continuation of Flash Of The Blade with the heavy guitars and pounding rhythm but it is definitely a great song. One of my favorites on this album, Powerslave is an incredible song. Right away, the song hits home with heaviness. Dickinson steps in with the microphone and sings incredible lyrics about an evil Egyptian god. The guitar of the pre-chorus is cool and gives the song and evil type sound but the chorus is where everything shines. Dickinson's vocals soar while the other instruments play something similar to a march or even their signature galloping sound. The song breaks down into a soft piece but picks up again and ends in perfection. The final song, the longest song Iron Maiden has ever done, is Rime Of The Ancient Mariner. All any fan can say about this song is \\"wow\\". Its is simply incredible. The guitars gallop, the bass pounds, the drums flow and Dickinson's vocals are amazing. The breakdown with the spoken part is eerie but cool. And like the song Powerslave, the song comes full circle and ends perfectly. Words can not begin to describe this song.<br />Among Iron Maiden's 12 studio albums, a majority of fans vote this album to be one of their favorites. It has everything Iron Maiden stood for from the beginning. Although a number of these songs aren't played live anymore, they are still classics in their own right and you have to love each and every one of them. I recommend this for every Maiden fan and any fan of metal in general. Go on. Buy it.
B00005T7I1|4.0|Dick Tracy(Beatty) is a tough detective in a 40's Us major city.<br />This stilish Chester Gould comic strip adaptation with bright colors and wardoble and also good make up effects is fun to watch from beginning to end.<br />With a comic and overmaked up Big Boy Caprice(Pacino) a ruthless gangster who wants to control the city and a perfect singer blonde bombshell Breathless Mahoney(Madonna) who wants Tracy and also Caprice from them and she has her own plans t orule the city disguished as a unmasked man with gutural voice.<br />A very good flick.
B000002KDO|5.0|By 1971, Black Sabbath were making a name for themselves as being the ground-breaking doom and gloom band that played deeper and harder than anyone else around. Their lyrically dark and musically deep songs fueled the fans and inspired generations of musicians. Their third album, Master Of Reality, just pushed their influence a little further. <br />Like the first eight albums, the line-up is unbeatable and clearly the best. John &quot;Ozzy&quot; Osbourne sings in his monotone style and sings the lyrics that glorify the unspoken. Guitarist Tony Iommi plays the inspirational riffs as found on all Sabbath outings but this time around, its darker and very sludgy. Geezer Butler's bass lines follow the flux of the thick riffs as he plays as wonderful as ever. Bill Ward's drumming sets everything in motion with his skillful beats and rhythm.<br />The album begins with the marijuana-praising Sweet Leaf. All the instruments really stand out here. The guitar is like a wall of sound. It extremely thick and deep and isn't about to be torn down. The finest moment of the song is Iommi's solo, where everything stops and the guitar blasts on. The rhythm is extremely fine here, as Ward plays perfectly and Geezer plays wildly, matching Iommi's guitar. After Forever is slightly different from any other Sabbath song. The difference is the rhythm of the instruments. Iommi uses less of the normal riffs and focuses more on power chords and such, providing a different backdrop to the song. Everything else is basically the same: lyrics about the afterlife and solid rhythm. Embryo is a short instrumental with simply a guitar and a violin. It doesn't really seem like much on this album but it is still a very good song. <br />Next is a classic. Children Of The Grave is one of the three heaviest songs on this album. The guitar work basically paved the way for fast-picking and again, Iommi uses more power chords than the usual riffs, which makes the song sound a bit thicker. The bass is heard well here, as Butler matches the guitar with precision. Orchid is another instrumental. Like the last one, it is very short and simple with some cool guitar work. Solitude is quite possibly the softest and quietest song Sabbath has ever recorded. Out of every song they have ever done (throughout all the different eras), this is the odd-man out. A lone, deep-toned guitar plays depressing notes while Ozzy's voice, not really sounding like Ozzy, sings of sadness and loneliness. It is an amazing song and very beautiful; a rare find among the Sabbath song catalog. Into The Void is a cool song that closes out the album well. The hard-hitting riffs, blasting rhythm and perfect vocals make you want to hear the album again.<br />Black Sabbath was one of the most influential heavy metal pioneers and here is the proof. Thick, down-tuned, low-toned riffs, rhythmic bass and drums and a new standard for metal singers was what the band set in motion. Dubbed their most influential album, this definitely has something to offer. I recommend this album to the Sabbath fans and metal fans in general. Anybody who says they are into metal but doesn't like Sabbath is only fooling him or her self.
B00005YW4H|4.0|In fall of 2001 I heard this young woman's performance on Charlie Hunters Analog Playground CD. The version of More Than This that Ms Jones sings is really entertaining.
B000002KET|5.0|&quot;...You know that I should&quot;. After four albums, Black Sabbath was beginning to get recognition for their deep, gloomy sound powered by down-tuned guitars, solid rhythm and distinctive and inspired vocals. In 1973, Sabbath released their fifth effort, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. <br />The line-up of this album is that of the traditional; the one that got the band its fame. Guitarist Tony Iommi lays down the deep riffs that are just as hard, loud and inspirational as any Sabbath outing before or after it, maybe even more. Drummer Bill Ward pounds the drums with intensity and the perfect beats while bassist Geezer Butler rages on through obscure bass tangents while still managing to keep the rhythm tight and adding a powerful punch to the music. At the front is vocalist Ozzy Osbourne with his distinctive, monotone vocals singing inspired lyrics over the traditional hard and heavy Sabbath.<br />The formula is pure Black Sabbath but with a different twist. All the elements are there but they have pulled a few new tricks out of the bag. Specifically, usage of other musical effects, i.e. the keyboard-laden Who Are You. Also on this CD, the band seems to be attempting to step out of the darkness of earlier songs such as &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; and trying to make some &quot;friendlier&quot; songs. The result is an 8 song masterpiece and their best, and maybe even most overlooked, album.<br />The album begins with the classic title track. Once Iommi's guitar spills through you speakers, don't lose focus on the music because you just might miss it. The song is the regular slow-paced &quot;doom&quot;-sounding song but within the previous three years, the band perfected their attack and it really shows here. Iommi's classical breakdowns are quite good and the heavy breakdown toward the middle has outstanding instrumentation. A National Acrobat follows up and happens to be one of my favorite Sabbath songs. Iommi throws in his signature guitar riffs and plays them to perfection while Geezer and Ward compliments the riffs and Ozzy's great vocals with a slow, solid rhythm. Simply an awesome song. Fluff is a simple, soft, acoustic piece. Iommi's metal guitar abilities shine through on most of the other songs but this track shows that the band is willing to turn down the volume for just a little bit. <br />The album picks up again with Sabbra Cadabra, an upbeat sort of love song. The guitar is pretty fast compared to the riffs found on other songs. The rhythm is really good and the lyrics and vocals shine. Killing Yourself To Live is another upbeat song in the same vein as Sabbra Cadabra. A lot of cool guitar riffs and fine beats but Ozzy's vocals are truly great here. Its not one of their classics but still a very awesome song. Who Are You is a complete turn from the usual Sabbath, as they use a keyboard to take the place of the guitar and bass. It's a slow, drifting kind of song. It could either cause you to slowly bob your head to its mind-numbing beat or put you to sleep. Looking For Today is a song in the style of Killing Yourself To Live but I find this one to be better. It has a &quot;fun&quot; upbeat sound, the vocals are pretty good and the instruments are played in the usual way. Spiral Architect is one of my favorite Sabbath songs. The guitar throughout the song is awesome (especially the intro), the lyrics are very interesting and the drumming is quite good.<br />To this day, Black Sabbath is still considered one of the best of the genre and this statement definitely holds true through this album. Everything the Sabbath established with their first four albums are injected within this album plus a little more. This is definitely for any and every Sabbath fan. Also, all you &quot;nu-metal&quot; fans who think your bands are true talent, pick this up as well the any other Sabbath album. You'll realize Sabbath played those band's songs thirty years...and they did it better. (No offense to the &quot;nu-metal&quot; bands intendedin any way)
0140430350|3.0|In his novel, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, W.M. Thackeray weaves an enjoyable tale that will prove pleasing to many audiences.  Within his work, Thackeray explores the role vanity plays in his characters lives.  This novel is set in various places in Europe and is focused around two main female characters, Ameila and Rebecca.  The novel opens as the girls are leaving a boarding school and follows them througout most of their lives.  Both experience different types of marriages and come from different backgrounds, but their friendship remains strong throughout the novel.  Chapters usually focus on either Amelia or Rebecca and ocassinally incorporate both into several, especially the first few.  I find this to be a very intreseting and helpful style of organization.  Thackeray also directly addresses his readers during various parts of the novel and helps them to form their own opinions about the topics at hand.  Within the novel, our main characters prove themselves to be very dynamic and interesting.   Amelia and Rebecca have very different  personalities, that do clash at times, but thier interaction adds to the drama of the novel.  The humorus explaination of other flat characters, such as Sir Pitt, help this novel to take a on lighter tone after more serious matters are discussed.  Although this novel incorporates more serious undertones about roles humans play in society and the importance of wealth and status, it also brings forth a warm romance that many readers are sure to enjoy. Wealth does prove to be an important aspect of this novel, as it is in many pieces written during this time period, and plays roles in both of the main characters lives.  Amelia and Rebecca experience both poverty and riches, each at different times, throughout the novel. As the characters true personalities are revealed, throughout the novel, many shocking secrets are brought forth.  And, as many novels do, the reader will most certianly find themselves wishing they could tell the characters what they should do.  Although, I personally find Thackeray's style somewhat exhausting, as he repeats previous facts and discusses unrealted imformation, he does create a very enjoyable novel that is sure to entice readers for many decades to come.

I think its soooo funny how the 3 witches, from the 1600's, are brought back to life in the 20'th century!

A very good movie that teens will love!<br />I highly recomend this movie,it is wonderful!
B00005O5CM|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies with Reese.  She is a wonderful actress and this role proves that.  I loved her in this part I think it was a great change for her.  IT also has the message that you can do anything you want in life, if you put your mind to it, and that everything happens for a reason.
B00005QXDD|5.0|How often is it that you hear a comedy album that you can play air-guitar to? (Jim Belushi's &quot;36-22-36&quot; comes to mind, but sometimes The Belush is a little too high-brow for my taste) Long after the jokes wear off(it takes a REALLY long time)this is still a great album to listen to because the songs are so darn good. Jack Black really does have a great voice and Kage is an awesome guitar player. Funny and great musicians? Justin Timberlake better watch his back(HAHAHAHAHAHA I'm so funny!HAHAHAHAHA)
B00004Z459|5.0|This was one of those CDs that you buy because you like one or two songs and then you get it home and it's just amazing. At first listen it's the kind of music your parents call \\"noise\\", but then you start thinking \\"Hold the train there, buddy! Is that a melody I hear? Har-mun-ee? OH MY GOODNESS!! This is MUSIC!!\\" It's a great blend of thumping rhythm, sweet guitar licks, and vocals that just penetrate. An excellent addition to any music collection.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|Whenever I buy a new CD I listen to the first 35-45 seconds of each song and then go back to the ones that really catch my attention. You can't do that with this CD. Yes the deep VOX is annoying at first, and actually for some songs will continue to be annoying. But, by the third hearing you'll love at least 9 of the tracks. This is a mellow and jamming CD with a live real instrument feel. (No technology here). The drums are great (REAL - no drum machine). After hearing it for the 6th time you'll easily recognize old Prince themes. 1+1+1=3 reminds you of Erotic City. The best cuts are: Muse 2 The Pharoah, Mellow, She Love Me For Me (like Sun, Moon and Stars from \\"RaveIn2...), all mellow cuts, and then the upbeat songs: The Work, Everywhere (reminds me of something I can't remember now) , 1+1+1=3, Family Name, and Everlasting Now... Terms like \\"Theocratic Order, the work, the school that teaches men aren't fit to rule, who's that knocking on our door didn't we throw you out before, and the truth\\" - as used in Everywhere, and many more are easily understood in context. Who would know that in 1+1+1=3 he is most likely talking about the Trinity. (Edit 11/03 After further listening I now believe this song is actually about the 3 fold cord in marriage - so ask the Artist at the sound check) For all who like Prince's humor, it can definitely be seen on this CD also. The line in Everlasting Now \\"You know this is funky but I just wish he'd play like he use to, old scraggly head son of a (Smack) is hilarious. It's just a reminder that Prince is really cleaning up his act, trying to stop cursing. This is great for fans of music - no \\"explicit lyrics\\" stickers, no raunchy lyrics. Imagine being able to listen to the old Erotic City beat on 1+1+1=3 and not having to turn it off when your mom or children come in the room. Also if you see this CD performed in the \\"One Night Alone\\" concert you'll appreciate it even more. Edit- 11/03 After seeing the ONA DVD again this music just keeps getting better.<BR>...
B000024D4R|5.0|This, along with &quot;wish you were here&quot;, is possibly the best studio album Pink Floyd ever did. Nothing (well, maybe &quot;the final cut&quot;) came close to the lyrical venom expressed here. Waters' lyrics are pure poison (and the bass intro on &quot;Sheep&quot; is marvelous!). Gilmour's playing here is simply his best. &quot;Dogs&quot; contains Rick Wright's last, majestic synth program. Mason's drums are steady and take prevalence on &quot;Pigs: Three Different Ones&quot;. The greatest album Floyd ever made.
B000008M54|5.0|This album is awesome. If you like celtic folk rock, it gets no better than this. I especially like the cover of &quot;Sweet Thing&quot;. And &quot;Bang on the ear&quot; is a jam. Not a weak track in the whole album. Buy it.
B0000636UN|2.0|I am a big fan of Sheryl Crow - but for some reason no album she's done as been as good as &quot;Tuesday Night Music Club.&quot; This one is incredibly boring and redundant.  All of the songs sound the same.  Good background music, I suppose.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is a movie to make you think, it plays with you as a viewer, never giving in easy. In the end it all makes sense, you just have to watch it, pay attention to the details, watch it again and keep an open mind (read some of the reviews if you need help or hints).<BR>If you like to be fed the storyline, go watch something else.  if you like being challenged by the film, to be part of the film, then buy this (don't rent it, just buy it).  Like a Borges or Cortazar story, the story forces you to think, consider the possibilities, watch and rewatch it (read and reread).  Very well made (if you need help understanding, surf the net, but don't give in easily).<BR>The DVD itself keeps the movie pure, you can't skip chapters.  But then again, if Mr. Lynch allowed you to do that it would be cheating.  The DVD shows the movie as it was intended to be viewed.  Bravo Mr. Lynch!
B00005LK95|5.0|In the first \\"Short Circuit\\" film, Number Five was viewed as more of a prop than a character. While the story revolved around a robot coming to life, the story seemed to focus more on the reactions of the people it interacted with than the robot himself. In this film, Number Five (who has adopted the name \\"Johnny Five\\") is a main character. He is given more of a personality, a bigger sense of humor, but most importantly, he is given emotion. Johnny Five knows he is alive, but he struggles throughout the film trying to prove it to the rest of the world.<br />Humor is not the main goal in this film (although it does exist); the movie is more of a drama. You almost forget that the main character who gets depressed with the fact that no one will accept him is a robot.<br />While not as funny as the first one, what the film lacks in humor it makes up with feeling. You'll even cry as Johnny is confronted by a group of thugs (I won't spoil it for you). That's not to say that there aren't good jokes along the way (one in particular when Ben, who already struggles with English, is prompted by Johnny Five while attempting to woo a girl).<br />Another plus with this film is the presence of muliple plots. This gives the movie a faster pace than the original. Ben, J5's co-creator, is attempting to break into the toy business (with some help from con man Michael McKean); two thugs, using Ben's warehouse as a means of breaking into the vault across the street, are terrorizing the two would-be toy makers; and Ben is struggling to win the love of a girl who sees him as nothing more than just a toy maker. There is nothing to bog this film down, and in the end, all the plots come together nicely.<br />All in all, this is a GREAT movie!!!
B00005JKJA|5.0|JUstlike the real Mulholland Drive, this movie will take you on a tour above Hollywood, making you dizzy at times with all the twists and turns, leaving you confused and maybe even mad.  However, by the time you make it back to the the real world you get to appreciate just how great it all was.  This movie is not titled Mulholland Drive just because of the events that take place on that road in the movie.<BR>This is a movie to make you think, it plays with you as a viewer, never giving in easy. In the end it all makes sense, you just have to watch it, pay attention to the details, watch it again and keep an open mind (read some of the reviews if you need help or hints).<BR>If you like to sit back and passively watch the movie while being fed the storyline, go watch something else.  But if you like being challenged by the film, to be part of the film, then buy this (don't rent it, just buy it, you'll watch it many times).  Like a Borges or Cortazar story, the story forces you to think, consider the possibilities, watch and rewatch it (read and reread).  It's very well made and DOES NOT have holes (if you need help understanding, surf the net, but don't give in easily).<BR>The DVD itself keeps the movie pure to the theater, because you can't skip chapters (the DVD has 1 chapter, 2.5 hrs long).  But then again, if Mr. Lynch allowed you to do that it would be cheating.  The DVD shows the movie as it was intended to be viewed and you have the watch the whole thing (in the end you'll appreciate it more that way).  Bravo Mr. Lynch!
B0000636UN|4.0|From the upbeat poppy Tuesday Night Music Club to the funky selftitled album to the moody and dark Globe Session, Sheryl suprises you again with a ROCK album.<BR>Although she has a lot of guests on this album, they don't dominate the songs. Sheryl is still number one. It's So Easy is the song I like the least. C'mon, C'mon and Over You are my favourites. Steve McQueen, absolutely rocks, and so does Lucky Kid. The Weather Channel is a nice ending of the record. Let Sheryl sing you to sleep....
B000002HJR|5.0|The first Down album, &quot;NOLA&quot;, was more than just a side project, it was an experience.  Phil Anselmo from Pantera, Pepper Keenan from C.O.C., Jimmy Bower from Eyehategod, and Kirk Windstein and Todd Strange from Crowbar united in 1995 for an album that was such a departure from their respective bands, but was loved by most, if not all, of their fans.  &quot;Lifer&quot;, &quot;Underneath Everything&quot;, &quot;Stone the Crow&quot;, &quot;Eyes of the South&quot;, &quot;Rehab&quot;, and &quot;Temptation's Wings&quot; remain personal favorites of mine, and after listening to this countless times for the past seven years, &quot;NOLA&quot; is one of the few albums that is truly timeless.
B00005KA9F|4.0|A great movie with quite a number of twists about a couple of highly skilled thieves traveling the world to find (and steal) treasures worth millions (and billions) of dollars.  As with most action movies, there are definitely scenes that are very unrealistic, yet others that I never would have dreamed of, that under the right circumstances could work.<br />Things that improved the rating of the movie:<BR>1)  NO SEX SCENES!  It is nice to see a movie that has great action, yet did not put in filth just to sell it.<BR>2) A unique plot.  So many flicks are about the same thing, just done differently.<BR>3) Great twists!  The movie kept you guessing until the end.  I kept wondering how it would end.  No, the good guys do not always win!<BR>4) Good acting.<BR>5) It kept a good pace through the entire movie.  I did not get bored by it being too slow nor did I get overwhelmed by it moving so fast that I could not keep track of what was happening.<br />Things that hurt the rating of the movie:<BR>1) The use of the \\"F\\" word several times.  There was absolutely no need to add profanity to this movie, especially what I consider being hard core profanity.<BR>2) A couple completely unbelievable and unrealistic scenes.  Stretch the imagination, but keep to things that can really happen.<br />Overall, this was a good movie with a good plot.  I would recommend this movie - especially if you have TV Guardian to filter out the few times of foul language.<br />My Rating: B+
0385503954|4.0|This was my first McEwan read, and while it was lovely in some ways, I don't necessarily agree that it's all everyone is raving about.  It seemed to me not all that interesting a story, nor all that accomplished  prosaically or stylistically.<br />There were instances in which I found myself thrilled and smiling, times when I reread passages to enjoy something a second time.  But I guess mostly I just want to convey that all the hoopla here and in other media about this book falls into the &quot;emperor has no clothes&quot; category as far as I'm concerned.<br />It's a good book, not a great book, and I'd have given it 3.5 stars if I could have.
6302038308|4.0|EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN is a sequel to the classic horror film, EVIL DEAD. The first seven minutes are so of the film retell what happened in the first film, but in condensed form (due to legal reasons, footage for the first film was not allowed in this one, so they had to retell the events; hard to do with only one returning actor from the first picture). Ash is back and after briefly being possessed after his night of hell, he is saved by the rising sun. Unable to escape the woods, he returns to the cabin to defend himself. He's attacked by the dead body and chopped off head of his deceased girlfriend, Linda. In the process, he has his right hand infected by the Evil and chops it off to save the rest of himself. Ash is later joined by a quartet: the professor's daughter, her finance, and two country hicks. They arrive in search of the Professor, but instead find Ash and well, things get all confused.<br />EVIL DEAD was made to be a strictly horror film, but included the slightest hints of humor. EVIL DEAD 2 has a few frightening moments, but is mostly a dark comedy woven within a tale of terror. Sam Raimi was really finding his style as a director and his touch is all over this movie. Bruce Campbell is great as Ash and plays the role with just the right dose of frightened bravo cockiness. The movie wouldn't have been as good with anyone else in the role.<br />I found EVIL DEAD 2 to be much more enjoyable than the first film. It was suspenseful without being frightening; chilling without being creepy; funny without being corny. If you're looking for a straight horror film, watch EVIL DEAD. However, if you want to watch a dark comedy interlaced with some moments of gore, watch EVIL DEAD 2.
0345339738|5.0|It is not really appropriate to rate this book as a standalone volume, as it is really just a third of a greater story.  Nonetheless, this rates a full five stars as the loose ends from the first two parts are tied up.  <br />The way things are resolved are both brilliant and follow from what is hinted at before.  From the final fate of the Ring to the problems in the Shire, it all fits.  In addition, the appendices add a richness to the world of Middle-Earth, giving it a depth in history and language that is incredible.<br />Books have been written about this trilogy, and hundreds of books have tried to imitate it, so it is obviously not a small task to praise it appropriately in this small area.  It is sufficient to give it five stars and let it speak for itself.
B00000JG41|5.0|Some would say this is Mr. Bungle's most normal album. But really, what does that mean? In the world of Mr. Bungle, &quot;normal&quot; is a relative measure. A &quot;normal&quot; Mr. Bungle song might still be the craziest music you've ever heard. On California, the songs maintain the backbone elements of Mr. Bungle: wacky lyrics, insane hops from style to style, and all around weirdness.<br />&quot;Ars Moriendi&quot; is pure aural insanity. What kind of song brings together Arabian melodies, gypsy music, and grindy speed metal? Why, a Mr. Bungle song, of course! This is one of their craziest songs ever, and will sit well with fans of the band's zanier moments.<br />How about &quot;Pink Cigarette&quot;? With lyrics like, &quot;Your kiss...touches everything but me,&quot; you might think this is an emotional, sad song. NEVER! Mr. Bungle waxes the cheese big-time, with Patton's emotional histrionics and the melodramatic orchestrations being far from heartbreaking. I love it; it's amusingly cheesy because the band obviously knows it's cheesy. Patton even makes fun of the turgid &quot;ahhhh&quot; backing vocals that were prevalent in the 50s and 60s. This band is the best.<br />Mr. Bungle has been accused of not knowing the value of a song, but their versatility never ceases to amaze and they definitely know how to compose. &quot;The Holy Filament&quot; is a bombastic new age piece with exquisite keyboards and very lush orchestrations that ooze grandeur and magnificence. It's very...unlike most of the band's work, but it fits because there are no rules in Mr. Bungle's game.<br />&quot;Goodbye Sober Day&quot; throws Balinese chants, lounge music, and thick-azz metal into a blender with acid and serves up a smooth mix.<br />Maybe because &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, &quot;Retrovertigo&quot;, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; are some of the most streamlined songs the band has done, people call this one normal. Still, &quot;None of Them Knew They Were Robots&quot;, &quot;Golem II&quot;, and &quot;The Air-Conditioned Nightmare&quot; are more Bunglian weirdness.<br />California belongs in your collection if you like your music endearingly strange.&quot;, and &quot;The Air-Conditioned Nightmare&quot; are more Bunglian weirdness.<br />California belongs in your collection if you like your music endearingly strange.
B00000JGOH|5.0|I have watched this movie numerous times and am always pleased at what I am seeing.  Shakespeare in Love is a rich comedy that offers a fictional behind-the-scenes look at the making of Romeo and Juliet.  At the same time, there is a sense of tragedy in the pairing of the star-crossed lovers of Shakespeare and Viola, who know that their love cannot last.<br />Events in the movie often involve Shakespearean devices, in particular the idea of women disguising themselves as men, which the Bard used repeatedly.  There are also pokes at the quirks of modern life which add to the fun.<br />This movie won a Best Picture Oscar, which was considered controversial because it beat Saving Private Ryan.  Good as that latter movie was, this one merits its victory with its superior writing and acting.  This is a great movie that holds up well over time.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Without fail, it seems those who see Mulholland Drive have a knee-jerk reaction in one of two ways: (a) they think it's pointless and stupid and weird and they're completely baffled by it, or (b) they become entranced and absorbed...and they're completely baffled by it.<br />The first time I saw this movie, I was in the (b) category. I couldn't explain it, I couldn't put it together, but I loved it. It begins with two story threads that are ostensibly unrelated. In one, a woman called \\"Rita\\" has lost her memory and -- with the help of a bold, aspiring actress named Betty -- tries to find out who she is. In the other, there appears to be a mysterious operation in Hollywood surrounding the casting process of a young director's latest movie. A number of weird scenes are interspersed amidst these two plot threads and seemingly have nothing to do with anything. In the final half hour, the movie's world is twisted around and by the time it ends, the viewer will probably be left scratching his head. Less patient viewers will probably start swearing like drunken sailors and break something (or maybe go watch Independence Day).<br />I was completely enthralled by every second of this film, but I needed to wait for the DVD before I could see it again and begin to try and understand it. I've seen it several times now and while I'm not much closer to understanding it, I love it just the same. I've read a number of interpretations of this movie that suggest anything from \\"it's all a dream\\" to \\"it's about how Hollywood corrupts\\" to \\"IT MAKES NO SENSE.\\" At the time of this writing, I've just watched it for the fourth time, and I must assert that there is a certain purpose behind everything, even the scenes which are the weirdest of weird. However, I cannot come up with a comprehensive understanding of this movie that elucidates _all_ its different elements. On one hand, the entire experience seems remarkably dream-like, almost a cinematic montage of self-contained, powerful episodes with a tenuous relationship to other scenes. On the other hand, though the movie appears to be sundered into two distinct parts, there is a definite connection to be made. A very fun movie to explore.<br />Naomi Watts' performance (as Betty) is absolutely stunning. If Halle Barry hadn't been so good in Monster's Ball, I'd have said Miss Watts deserved the Oscar for Best Actress in 2001 (I don't even know if she was nominated...but the Oscars are dumb anyway). Think carefully about Betty's acting audition...it's one of the theme's pillars.<br />Can you \\"cut the Gordian knot\\" of Mulholland Drive? In other words, can anyone solve the puzzle of this movie? I'm honestly not sure anyone can -- there's a 5000+ word analysis out there on the Internet that is quite great, but even it can't account for everything. There may not be a complete answer at all. Maybe this movie just resists sound reasoning entirely. But it sure is great.<br />The bottom line? Watch the movie, I guess. You might think it's the dumbest film ever made, or get consumed by the mystery of it all.<br />The DVD itself is pretty weak feature-wise. No scene selection, for one thing, which is pretty much inexcusable. It's made so much worse for the fact that there are a number of very poignant scenes that just beg repeated viewings. Other than that, you get the obligatory DVD features with no appreciable extras. Bummer.es with a tenuous relationship to other scenes.

6304696558|3.0|A spoiled Judy Benjamin get's married to an ugly ... guy with an even uglier hairdo (white people can't wear fro's without looking ridiculous). He dies of a heart attack on their honeymoon as they make love on the bathroom floor. A smooth talking Army recruiter hears her sad tale on a radio talk show and offers to help her. After smooth talking her in his office, she signs up. Sounds like a real good story right? Well......<br />Judy's arrival at Ft Biloxi is funny as are other boot camp scenes... Once Judy decides to tough out basic, it just isn't a comedy anymore. She actually starts to get annoying.<br />After being given an ultimatum from her CO, (jump or screw) Judy jumps from the airplane. She cries [wolf] and gets an assignment in Paris. It all goes downhill from here. She meets up again with a snobbish Frenchman that she met in Biloxi (yeah I know). Well he's a communist and the Army wants her to stop dating him. She decides to marry him, then changes her mind once she's out of the Army. The final scene is her running happily down the road in a wedding dress acting like a 16 year old.<br />This movie is a lot like Full Metal Jacket in that after boot camp, everyone shuts it off. Bill Murray's 'Stripes' is a good example of 'interest after the boot camp scenes'. Maybe that's why the old TV show 'Private Benjamin' only dealt with boot camp type training.
B00003CY6M|2.0|Serendipity has so many things going for it.  It is a shame that it had to be deficient in one major area to make this movie less than enjoyable.<br />John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale are great as lead characters and they are great in the scenes the are in together (which are hardly any, which is part of the problem of the movie.)  Great supporting parts are played for comic relief by Molly Shannon and Jeremy Piven.<br />John and Kate meet and spend a few hours together and supposedly bond in such a way that they will always be in love.  Then several years down the road, they are about to marry someone else.  Then John and Kate felt drawn to end their engagements and call off their marriages just for the hope of finding that long lost casual acquaintence.  The movie overlooks all of the time and effort and friendship and love that would have caused John and Kate to become engaged to these poor saps.  So when they abandon them to try and find each other, I found myself rooting for John and Kate to not find each other and to marry the person they actually love.<br />This movie is funny and entertaining, just incredibly unbelievable and therefore not to be taken seriously.
6302517036|4.0|Alfred Hitchcock didn't die of old age  -  he shuffled off this mortal coil because the movies went to the teenagers.  But if he'd lived, and ever delved into the supernatural, he might easily have made this movie.<br />Average high school kid Charlie has a debonair new neighbor, Mr. Dandridge, who seems to entertain a different knockout girl every night.  Problem is, after they've been to Dandridge's house, the next place they're seen is on the evening news  -  dead.  As if that isn't bad enough, Charlie's seen fangs in Dandridge's smile, and Dandridge only comes out at night.  Who can Charlie get to believe him?  His mother, friends, and the local police think he's seen too many vampire movies.  But Dandridge knows what Charlie's seen.  And he's not about to let him go on talking about it.<br />This is a great cat-and-mouse thriller, that just happens to be about a vampire instead of a mere serial killer.  The script is clever, the performances good.  Chris Sarandon is charming and menacing, in equal measure, as Dandridge.  Roddy McDowall gets to play cowardly hero as the first person Charlie gets to believe him  -  a late-night horror movie host/has-been actor, who sets out to cure Charlie of his \\"delusion\\" and instead meets the devil next door.  A pre-Married With Children adorable Amanda Bearse plays Charlie's girlfriend.<br />The effects are quite good, as are the atmosphere and musical score.  The film's only drawback is that it is sometimes directed with a heavy hand, and spends too much time on the juvenilia of Charlie and his friends  -  though the latter works to good effect, in the sense that it makes them very believable high schoolers, hardly up to facing the menace of an experienced and supernaturally powerful killer.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This movie obviously thinks it is doing something 'new' and 'special', and evidently it has managed to deceive many people. The trouble is, the film is entirely lacking in heart. The plot is thin and predictable, the characters are cliches, the dialogue is appaling. Even the editing and the direction appear heavy-handed. Every sequence goes on too long. Lengthy parts of the film are actually REPEATED later on, and sometimes more than once. As if they weren't dull enough the first time round, we have to see them again!<br />If you want to see a real work of art which revitalises the musical genre, check out 'Everyone says I love you'.

B00005RFAI|4.0|Theres something very striking about Miss Alicia Moore.  Besides the fact that shes obviously attractive, theres something very charismatic about her.  She stands out from the crowd because of what I perceive as a f**k you all attitude that is kind of refreshing.  That and the fact that she changed from an R&amp;B singer to a pop-rock singer in one swoop.  Missundaztood is a perfect title for a reinvention of ones persona.  Pink could always sing, but I didn't know she could sing this well.  She actually has emotion when she sings, not just empty vocal acrobatics that seem to haunt most pop these days.  These songs deal with real family issues, I was flabbergasted to hear some of these lyrics which are actually hard-hitting.  But Pink knows how to have some fun so the requisite dance tracks are present and quite excellent.  The highlights for me at least are the amazing &quot;Family Portrait&quot;, &quot;Don't Let Get Me&quot;, and &quot;Numb.&quot;  Numb is a perfect example of what did not expect of hear from Pink.  Its quite strange to hear a guitar in a Pink song, but it fits and so well.  When I was reading Rolling Stone, the other day Shirley Manson of Garbage said Pink would make an excellent front woman for a band, and I couldn't agree more.  Well done, Miss Moore.
0446677450|2.0|I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend.  While it wasn't horrible, I couldn't get past how many times the author restated the same thing.  He gets stuck on a topic and won't move on.  I got it the third time you said it.  I also thought his financial examples left out many important items.  He talks about making money out of no money.  How can that be?  His example states that he bought a $75,000 house for $20,000.  In the end, he sold the house for $60,000 so he said he made $40,000 out of nothing.  In the end, he might have made out but for some period of time he was out 20 grand.  Am I missing something here?<BR>I wish I had checked this book out from the library. There's some fundamental principles we can all follow but it's not worth a purchase.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Is it possible that pop songs can not look at all like pop songs and still be pop songs? I guess it must be possible or My Bloody Valentine would never have existed. From that self-same theory, Radiohead has fully completed their transformation from Alt-radio sweethearts to underground musical geniuses, while still selling millions of albums. This album is a delight, from the moment it begins to the last note they take us through a rogue's gallery of musical styles and genres and produce a wonderfully listenable effort. This record is one of my current favorites to turn up too loud on the long night time drive from San Francisco to Santa Cruz as I get home from work. It's just busy enough to keep me interested while also presenting a lovely aural landscape to match the gorgeous physical one.<br />Buy it if you like : buzzes and beeps that somehow come out sounding like a catchy hook.
B00005JH7D|5.0|I picked up M2 by accident last summer -- I listened to it at an in-store listening station, and instantly fell in love with it it.  Sure, it's got awesome bass playing to it, but not being a bass player, I noticed it more for its refreshing originality and unparalleled class.  The bass lines are solid, the bass solos are incredible, the guitar/synth/keyboard rhythm section is a joy to listen to, the horn section is tight, and the drums and drum sounds are great.  It's an awesome display of urban culture and soul.  If you've got the money, buy this CD; if not, save up!  It's well worth it!
B000002A3T|5.0|I believe that some true Floyd fans look past this album, mainly because it lacks the lyrics of Roger Waters. I have heard every Floyd album, and maybe two or three compare musically to TDB. High Hopes (very well writen), Marooned (award winning guitar solo), Lost For Words, and A Great Day For Freedom are all Floydian masterpieces. Even the fillers are solid songs all together. Pink Floyd was not just one man (Waters) as some may believe. Without him, the rest of the crew, Gilmore, Mason, and Wright come together one more time to give off the flavor that they had in their prime. The product yields amazing chemistry and power that their music has always had. This conceptual album is one that contains softer lyrics that are not as searing as Waters, since most come from Gilmore and his wife. The content is respectable. The only flaw, alot of \\"you-me.\\" The drums are a step up from the previous album and return to the form of the original Floyd. Wright plays a larger part singing Wearing The Inside Out, which also has Dick Parry playing the sax again. The flow, in and out from beginning to end is extremely well, similar to Dark Side. The guitar solos are melodic and deep in just about every song. With the help of a few other musicians, the depth of each note is a pleasure to listen to. The Division Bell is not just for all Floyd fans, but for anyone who appreciates deep and relaxing music to listen to any time of the day. It is really no surprise to me that it was the bands only release to hit the #1 spot on both the U.K. and U.S. charts. Overall, it should not be left out of any music collection. Its a gem. Adios! Go Red Sox!
630575067X|1.0|Aside from movies directed by John Woo this is the worst film I've ever seen.  It's not like it's any one thing, either.  It just falls so completely short of everything that it could be.  Jar-Jar, awful cue-card reading by Jake Lloyd, a terribly over-the-top Darth Maul...  I don't harbor any ill-will to anyone over this movie, I just wonder what the hell happened since the first trilogy.  Oh well, I've still got the original trilogy, pre-special edition, so that's what I'll keep watching.  CGI effects just look too much like a cartoon for me to take anything but PIXAR movies seriously.  I wish I liked this movie, I really do, but as it stands I'm not even going to bother watching Episode 2 now.  Beside, will missing a &quot;performance&quot; by Christopher Lee really be that bad?

That is what happened to Anne Frank, during World War II, while the Nazis were attacking Holland. Anne along with seven other jews went into hiding. This book really opened my eyes away frrom our luxurious homes into what other people went through. After i read this book, it gave me an understanding and a whole new perspective towards life. Anne Frank not only always had and optimistic mind, but also always made the best of her time. Afer reading this book, I have realized that people have to be happy with what hey have, and not always expect more. It is people like Anne Frank, who make a differencee in your life. In order to learn a lot of lifes lessons and understand life and the world we live in, read the amazing diary of Anne Frank. You don't want to miss out on it!!!!
B0000640VO|5.0|This a wonderful film.  It is enjoyable on so many levels.  It is loud, it is funny, it is so colourful, it is vibrant, it is very moving.  The first twenty minutes of this film are a masterpiece of film-making - they are also happen to be hilarious.  Audrey Tautou is marvellous as Amelie.  Through a chance discovery she decides she wants to be a do-gooder and to make other people happy.  But she is also very introverted when it comes to her own happiness.  The end of the film is very moving for Amelie realises that making others happy, while gratifying, is not sufficiently fulfilling when she herself has no love in her life.    <br />As for DVD extras, the director's commentary is as charming as the movie itself - he is great company and so French with it.  This DVD will be a valuable contribution to anyone's collection.

0780627024|3.0|Ultimately, I did not like this film, but it was unique and should receive many accolades for what it does accomplish.<br />Written and directed by Gary Ross, Pleasantville tells the story of two modern day teenagers, a brother and sister pair played by Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon, who happen upon a journey into 1950's TV land.  The people they meet are as naive, two dimensional, and black and white as the people in the \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" sitcom.  It is up to the two teenagers to bring some \\"color\\" into their lives.<br />The film is clearly an indictment of those who would place a mythological feel-good face on 1950's America, or on any all-white culture containing a male-dominated power structure.  Ross  attempts to show us that there is beauty in our imperfections, in our diversity, and in the day-to-day realities of our human condition.  <br />If in fact he did this, the film would be a success.  Unfortunately, I couldn't much object to the world and the people of Pleasantville.  Okay, sure, they're sappy and saccharine in flavor ; but they're sincere people, they're nice people.  Although we're supposed to believe they would keep minorities and others who are different out of their little haven, the natural curiosity of the townspeople once the two teenagers arrive belies such a presumption.  Heck, the citizens of this town seem like they'd be open to anyone arriving at their doorsteps!  And even if there is a hierarchy, no one seems to benefit from or be hurt by the power structure. There's no violence here, there's no hatred.  The high school boys don't treat the girls as objects, and the fire department only exists to pull cats out of trees.  Is that really such a bad world?...<br />...Simply put, anyone who was satisfied with the presentation of Pleasantville as an artificial, ignorant, and oppressive community will buy the premise of the film and be inclined to enjoy it all the way through.  Those (like me) who felt we need a greater explanation as to why the town needed changing are unlikely to find much plausibility or good reasoning for what happens as the film proceeds.<br />Worst is that what initiates the changes is not the arrival of a blossoming artist or the introduction of diversity and tolerance into the community, but rather, a self-centered egotistical girl who wants to sleep with as many guys as she can (Reese Witherspoon's character).  Granted, sexual freedom is a necessity in a free and liberated society, but I really don't think Witherspoon's character or her actions act as the right vehicles to bring about positive change.<br />The film really struggles in the second hour, becoming very slow and dull at times.  It often loses its focus, like when the people of Pleasantville suddenly become mean in order to keep the \\"coloreds\\" out, but then change back to being nice shortly thereafter.  I suspect this lack of focus has to do with said structural flaws contained in the early part of the film.  <br />I am a strong believer that imperfection is beauty, but I just couldn't buy that argument within the context of this film.  In other words, I see the point the director/writer is trying to make, but I just don't think he made it well.  This contrasts with The Truman Show, which invokes similar criticisms of our TV world culture, but in this viewer's humble opinion, does so successfully.<br />Having said all of that, I give this film a lot of credit.  The movie raises many questions, and forces us to consider things that Hollywood itself would often like to hide.  So many pieces of this film are well made, such as the growth of the color on the screen amidst the black and white, the attention to detail within the town, the tone, and especially the excellent acting.  I would like to see more films like this - films that take risks and don't necessarily succeed.  Who says that every movie has to perfect?  The oxygen of art is experimentation, isn't it dangerous to discourage such creativity?<br />Ifyou're looking for a sure bet, a film that will clearly be good and satisfying for an evening, avoid Pleasantville.  If you don't mind experimentation, and would like to encourage Hollywood to take more risks, then rent this movie.  Pleasantville is a worthy journey

B00004Z459|5.0|Ok, this is in response to Fire Godd's review: these songs were written and recorded BEFORE the guys in Linkin Park made it big.  They're not whining about being rock stars - the lyricist was just writing about his life experience.  Maybe you should actually LISTEN CLOSELY before bashing someone else's work.<br />What makes this album a must-listen-to are the lyrics and the music.  This band may be in the rap-metal genre, but they do it a lot better than Fred Durst &amp; his back up band.  For starters, LP keeps it balanced with the rap and the metal aspects.  Both singer Chester Bennington and emcee Mike Shinoda share duties with the mic.  DJ Mr. Hahn brings in the hip-hop flavor with his scratching skills.  Guitarist Brad Delson brings in the crunching guitar licks that are metal in its orgins as well as back-up harmonies that are Edge-esque.  Add in drummer Rob Bourdon and bassist Phoenix and you've got a band that's not afraid to rock hard all night long.  <br />Each song is capable of standing on its own.  &quot;Crawling&quot; has a haunting background - and Brad's vocal harmonies - that complements Chester's vocals from start to finish.  Mike raps his best on &quot;In the End,&quot; &quot;A Place for My Head&quot; and &quot;Papercut.&quot; Brad's guitar licks are at its best (in my opinion) in &quot;A Place For my Head&quot; while DJ Mr. Hahn is given free rein to do his thing on &quot;Cure for the Itch.&quot;<br />The only other way I can say that these guys rock and you should give them a chance is this: LP has a permanent place in my CD player along side with Sevendust, Godsmack, and Rob Zombie.  Not to mention, my hard-rock loving, Ozzfest regualar attendee brother actually finds these guys to be great and worthy of BUYING the CD, not burning it.  I thinks that's the greatest compliment anyone can give a group/band/duo/singer, don't you?
B000002KJQ|5.0|Being a ZZ Top fan, I did not hesitate to purchase Tres Hombres on cd.  While the music itself is absolutely powerful and enjoyable, the remix leaves much to be desired.  It does change the album from the way ZZ Top should sound.  Tres Hombres is still, though, a must have for any ZZ Top fan.  Great music and good times.
044022425X|3.0|I love the Outlander series and I devoured this book as quickly as the others.  But, for the first time, I felt that the story was running out of steam.  The novel introduces the time travel thing again, this time it is Roger and Brianna who make the leap into the Eighteenth Century to hunt for Jamie and Claire.  This is where the book was a real cliffhanger as the reader cannot wait to read the reunion between Jamie and Brianna.  <br />It then stumbles for the last third waiting for its resolution.  I will not say why since anyone who has not read the book would kill me!  I think it is right that the focus has now moved on to Brianna and Roger but their love story has not been as well fleshed out as that of Jamie and Claire.   However, if you love the Outlander books, you are not gonna care a hoot - you will love this and will not be able to put it down until it is over.

B0000636UN|5.0|I bought Sheryl Crow's new album &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; the first day it came out, and my day was made 1000 times better. &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; is slightly different from Sheryl's previous albums, but that doesn't take away from the great amount of talent that Sheryl has as a musician. &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; is a great album to blast out of the speakers of your car stereo, and sing to at the top of your lungs. My favorite songs are &quot;Abilene,&quot; &quot;Safe and Sound,&quot; &quot;Weather Channel,&quot; &quot;Steve McQueen,&quot; and &quot;Diamond Road.&quot; If you want to have some fun listening to a great album, the Sheryl Crow's latest &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot; is for you.
B000007OTH|5.0|Have you ever wondered what might have happened to the great Austro-German symphonic tradition if Brahms and Bruckner hadn't come along? Max Bruch provides one possible answer: a thoroughly original elaboration of the melody-based symphonic style of Mendelssohn (and, to an extent, Schumann). Bruch was a close friend of Brahms, but any influence from the latter is undetectable. Not too surprising: Bruch's first two symphonies were written well before the Brahms First appeared and are roughly contemporary with Bruckner's earliest symphonies. In any event, Bruch's symphonic style has little in common with the (in different ways) rigorously architectural styles of his two great Austro-German contemporaries. Nevertheless, Bruch's symphonies are, in their own way, superbly memorable. Bruch's melodies are distinguished, his counterpoint impeccable and his sense of orchestral color second to none. (Think of these pieces more as first-rate orchestral suites than as organically developed symphonies and you won't be far off the mark.) Most important, this music stays in your memory; none of the dull, uninspired note spinning provided by forgettable composers like Draeseke or Raff who are, every once in a while, trotted out by orchestras looking for 19th century novelties. Masur and the Gewandhaus Orchestra clearly have this music in their bones and play it to the hilt. The short works for violin and orchestra make for welcome bonuses. Recorded sound is wonderful and the price is right. Don't hesitate!

0312965788|5.0|Written by James Alfred Wight under the pen name James Herriot, ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL is the semi-autobiographical adventures of a 1930s vetenarian working in Yorkshire, England--and as he grows in experience we meet the people and animals that populate his world.<br />Any one old enough to turn a page will love this book.  It is written in an effortless and easy-to-read style, and the clinic's experiences with everything from runaway pigs to lavishly spoiled lapdogs makes for laugh-out-loud fun.  Who could forget Tristan's battle with a savage sow or the dog that howled?  How about the hens that flew the coop or Tricki-Woo's birthday party?  Or the car with no brakes or the cow that would never get up again?  Herriot's comic tales can easily make you laugh until you cry.<br />But ALL CREATURES isn't only about laughter.  There is also the hard work of farming and the simple integrity of those who struggle to survive on the land, where the loss of a cow can mean the difference between surviving another year and financial disaster.  There is also the sorrow at the loss of a treasured companion.  And through it all, from the wildly comic to the poignant and touching, there is always, always the story of the relationship between man and animal, joyously told.  Easily one of the most completely enjoyable books I've ever read, and very strongly recommended.

6305907145|2.0|One thing Jane Austen continually riled against was moralistic preaching.  Unfortunately her genius tends to show up \\"improvers\\" such as Rozema as very small artists in comparison, particularly when so inclined to sort us all out morally... <br />I was so disappointed, as Mansfield Park is for me Austen's most profound work, full of all sorts of symbolism which are completely missed and even destroyed in this shabby, misanthropic and anachronistic \\"adaption\\".  <BR>The outstanding exception is the wonderful portrayal of Henry Crawford.<br />I love Frances O'Connor (she is wonderful in the underrated \\"Thank God He Met Lizzie\\"), but here she is very poorly directed and has to work with very undisciplined writing.<br />I hope Rozema will leave out trying to tell us what we must think in future projects - she has no talent for it.
B00004Z1MN|4.0|I enjoyed &quot;Frequency&quot; very much!<BR>There are many factors in this movie, sci-fi, crime suspense, thriller, drama and time paradox. I think the director managed to handle these various elements deliberately. I had never seen such an acrobatic, but emotional drama.<BR>When John appeared in 1999, I was puzzled about why John was so depressed, almost an alcoholic. But in the progress of the story, I understood that when John lost his father, he lost his spirit and guts, too. I was deeply impressed by the ties that bind father and son together. As John talked to his father and got new memories, he got back his spirit.<BR>Jim Caviezel acted the complicated character well. He didn't over-act, so this movie succeeded as an emotional drama, I think. Dennis Quaid acted the perfect father very well, too. Because of his acting, I could understand that John's life has been so sad without Frank.<BR>I want to watch the movie again. Although I know the unexpected twist at end, I will enjoy the emotional scene in this acrobatic story better.
0679746048|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book because it wasn't full of a lot of self pity. It is very well written, and tends to jump around in time. The book is about the author, Susanna, who is unexpectedly shipped to a mental institution for a &quot;rest&quot; and lands there for almost 2 years. For somebody suffering from a mood disorder, there is a lot they can relate to, and you really get into the characters.

B00003CY6M|1.0|I love John Cusack.  His acting is so good he manages to rescue almost any movie he's in.  This one was just so bad however, that no rescue was possible.<br />Cusack does turn in another great performance, especially given the dirth of material he had to work with.  Jeremy Piven as his best friend was also good.  The chemistry between these two was great and they were really fun to watch.<br />The chemistry between Cusack and Beckinsale just wasn't there.  And why cast Beckinsale in this movie anyway?  She looks abominable!  Why not cast someone attractive instead, with charm and personality?  Beckinsale's bad camera looks aside, her acting is deplorable.  She certainly didn't redeem her terrible performance in Pearl Harbor in this clunker.<br />If you have to see this movie, see it for Cusack.  With another co-star, he might have been able to make something light and sweet out of this mess, but with Beckinsale, this flops.  Totally.
B00003CXAA|5.0|It's hard for me to believe that there is anyone out there who hasn't seen Coppola's 3 Godfather movies.  If there is such a person, he or she would be well advised to buy this set.  Don't believe what people say about the 3rd part being a stinker either.  It may not be quite as stellar as the first two films but it is a worthy conclusion to the film saga and is necessary to bring closure to the series.  A \\"Who's Who\\" of the acting world, this film trilogy uses just about anyone who became big in the 1970s as an actor plus big actors from other eras as well. There's Marlon Brando's return to the big time in the first film as the pater familias of a New York City mob family, the godfather himself.  However, even more identified with this film series is Al Pacino, who stars in all 3 films as the the godfather's son who is reluctant to enter the family business but then shows himself to have even more natural talent in it than his father did.<br /><br />Robert DeNiro plays the Brando role in the 2nd film but is the \\"young\\" godfather starting out in New York.  He is superb.  Robert Duvall is the family lawyer in the first two films and his brash, overbearing style here is hard to imagine when juxtaposed with quieter, later roles of his, showing us the full range of his talent.  Diane Keaton as Michael's wife brings the thankless job of being a mob wife totally home. The late John Cazeles is wonderful as Michael's weak brother, Fredo.  And you see James Caan here in the role that he would play for the rest of his career, Sonny Corleone, the hot headed brother of Michael's, who doesn't have enough control over himself to take over his father's position. Artistically I think Coppola went even higher with his \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" \\"One From the Heart\\" and \\"The Conversation\\" but why split hairs? He's a formidable talent and most of his work, including this trilogy, shows that.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down is one of the most original bands in the major label music business today.  This release is full of great lyrics, great vocals, and nut-kicking grooves.  The track \\"Toxicity\\" has one of the all-time great endings and speaks to the \\"inner warrior\\" in us all. A must have have for all!...
B00003CXSP|3.0|From all I'd read about this film, I was really expecting an F viewing experience that I'd turn off after the first half hour.  Much to my surprise, this is a good night's entertainment.  It is NOT as good a work as \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" which was a solid \\"A\\" film but this film is lacking Jodie Foster and (director) Jonathan Demme so I'm not suprised it doesn't score as well. Anthony Hopkins is once again totally up to par on playing the cannibalistic, murderous psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.  He's been living a low profile for ten years but comes forward when FBI agent Starling makes it into the headlines over a street arrest gone bad.  2 opponents Hannibal must thwart are a rich former victim of his, ably played by Gary Oldman, and Starling's boss, played by Ray Liotta, who turns obnoxiousness  into almost an art form.<br /><br />I was also glad to see Giancarlo Giannini play an Italian cop in this film, who tries to bring in Hannibal for a monetary reward while Hannibal is in Italy.  Julianne Moore does an able job but one can't help but compare her to Foster and there is too big gulf between the two actors in their levels of talent.  Let's just say that any actor is asking for trouble to try to take on a role Foster has already done.  The extra features are superb on this film and director Ridley Scott is a marvelous film teacher.  His commentary on the DVD is absolutely superb and no matter how you feel about the film, Scott has a lot to show you about making movies.  The special features on this DVD I'd grade an A and hubby absolutely was glued to every moment of them as he's a fiend for \\"special feature\\" DVDs.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00005JKYS|5.0|I thought that this was an awesome movie!  I laughed, I almost cried.  I LOVE Mel Gibson though so I'm automatically predjudiced!!!!!<br />Watch this movie!!!<BR>~Sarah
B00003CXZ1|2.0|Angelina Jolie was absolutely fabulous in \\"Girl Interrupted\\" and \\"Gia.\\" She's an absolutely gorgeous woman with acting talent to match--quite a combination.  Why she wasted her talent on this film, an overblown cartoon about an Englishwoman type superhero, is what I can't understand.  Jolie enters the action adventure genre with this film and I hope she doesn't intend to do more films in that genre.  If you like fight sequences, you might like this film.  If you like looking at Jolie, you also might like it.  That's not enough for me though and this film offered nothing else.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000002TQV|5.0|This album is such a significant event in music, akin in influence to My Bloody Valentine, The Smiths and Joy Division.  The song \\"Bones\\"  absolutely rocks and the guitar notes at about 2:32 elapsed absolutely bring the song to a thunderous crescendo. Also, the songs \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" and \\"Bulletproof\\" are testaments that great songs can be seemingly simplistic, but filled with emotional verbage that leaves the listener shocked and drained.  This CD NEVER leaves my car and I highly recommend it to anyone interested at the beginning stages of Radiohead's progression. In fifty years people will still be listening to this disc with amazement and pure joy. Really, how many albums can you say that about?
B00003CY5J|2.0|Yes, this film shows the A list actors of the '50s, '70s and '90s in a totally predictible, flat caper film.  DeNiro is the main thief who works in association with Brando and is aided by Norton.  Norton does do an astonishing acting job portraying a retarded man, at his job in the customs house as a janitor, so that he can scope out the scene of his crime.  When he's not at work, he is \\"normal\\" and the character trait difference is extreme.  In fact, maybe this film had an overload of talent and should have just used Norton in this role as a solitary thief, especially since DeNiro and Brando don't get a chance to show off their similar range of ability.  A huge disappointment for me since I normally love Brando and DeNiro in anything.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00003CXA2|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. It has love, humor, action, adventure, tragedy, and every other genre imaginable. This film is a work of pure genius, and no wonder it has been nominated for soo many awards. I strongly urge you to get this movie as a part of your collection, as you will watch it hundreds of times. I certainly do.
B00005JKES|2.0|I could'nt wait to get this beautiful DVD, as I'm a big Twin Peaks fan, but I've been really disapointed to realize that no subtitles at all were on this issue. Not even in english for people who does'nt ear well. No spanish, nor french (some people in Canada speak french you know ?)<BR>I tryed to get in touch with the company, but they ignored me, as arogant as possible.

078062565X|5.0|I cna't add to what others have said. This movie is terrific, combining power and pathos, fear and love, beauty and ugliness, bravery and cowardice, into one of the best movies ever made.<BR>It contrasts the simple, brave, powerful and beautiful King Kong and his actions with the ugly, modern, selfish, destructive modern man.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I love the origninal star wars trilogy, even though now it's been over 20 years since it's came out, especcially for it's time star wars changed the way people looked at movies. I was so exicted about episode 1, when I saw it.....I loved it, but it was quite different than I thought it to be......and so different  from the original trilogy. there where downs about this movie, but I still think this movie deserves 5stars*. For anyone who hasn't seen it I won't spoil it for them, but I reccomend this to star wars fans!ps.may16,2002,episode2arrives!
B00005R2M3|5.0|Yes, that's right, Shakira's a genius. Her English debut LAUNDRY SERVICE is an instant hit. Lyrically Shakira's earthy lyrics present her as wacky yet stable. How to explain, you can't really. Each song on LAUNDRY SERVICE is infused with a classic rock element and pop finish. It's also a perfect blend of rock and dance with Latin influences. This CD also includes 2 original Spanish tracks. Both are totally awesome. Actually LAUNDRY SERVICE is very fulfilling.<br />Musically it's very easy to get into. Tracks like the funky opener, \\"objection (tango)\\" is wild, fresh and rooted in tango/rock. Shakira's voice is unmatched. Her voice is strong when it needs to be and a gentle purr when it needs to be. It's wild, sort of untamed in a way. I think she's got one of the most unique voices in music today. LAUNDRY SERVICE is not a synth-sugary pop album. <br />It's rooted in rock and wrapped up nicely with pop sensabitites. Songs like \\"whenever, wherever\\" are instantly catchy fun. Other standouts include \\"objection (tango)\\", \\"underneath your clothes\\", \\"rules\\", \\"the one\\", que me quedes tu\\", and \\"fool.\\" Actually every single song is excellent. There isn't a bad song on here. Honest! LAUNDRY SERVICE is one of those CDs that's both lyrically daring and fun to listen to. <br />This CD also showcases Shakira as a multi-talented artist. She wrote, arranged, and produced the entire album. She even wrote a lot of the music! Now, how many artists can you think of with talent like that? Did I mention that she excels at everything on here? Lyrically, musically, production wise, LAUNDRY SERVICE is a gem.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I started out hating the film and ended up loving it. I laughed out loud all the way home from the theater about the subtleties, nuances, incredibly wonderful acting and the amazing convoluted plot. (And then immediately ordered the DVD.) Lynch maintains a sweetly painful tension that keeps you on the edge of your seat for 2-1/2 hours. It is a many layered film. In addition to the obvious love story told in psuedo flashback, what no one has seemed to get from this film is that it is the history of Hollyweird told through Hollywood clich. And I only picked up a few references, the most obvious being the Howard Hughes/Terry Moore reference. Someone who knows the history of film better than I could probably pinpoint them all. Buy this DVD. You will want to watch this film again and again. And it will withstand the test of time.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|GOLD is the CD I've been waiting most of my (relatively young) life for.<BR>Adams makes it possible for those not old enough to have witnessed rock 'n' roll in it's heyday, to make up for lost time. And this isn't JUST rock 'n' roll; this is special, magical, pure and unadulterated rock 'n' roll, which more than makes up for missing out the first time around.<br />And for those of you that were lucky enough to be there, GOLD serves as an eloquent summary of the music you love and lost to the music that have since come along to take it's place.<BR>Well, rock is back with a vengeance.<br />GOLD hasn't left my stereo since I bought it around four months ago, which is no mean feat considering my stereo is a single CD system.<BR>In a sense, despite the lack of lovelorn disasters in my life, GOLD has become something of a personal soundtrack these last few months. <BR>I cherish it THAT much.
B00004RF98|5.0|This is a movie I put away to watch when I'm home with a cold or just feeling down.  One of my top 3 favorite movies of all time, it never fails to raise my spirits<br />The movie was produced as a showcase / musical review of  composer Nacio Herb Brown's songs.   Screenwriters Camden &amp; Green did a wonderful job at weaving a story that brings it all together in the most fun &amp; entertaining way.<br />Donald O'Connor is SO underrated.  Gene Kelly has a wide range to his talent (Acting + Writing + Dancing + Choreography), but Donald O'Connor is pure genius in matching Kelly, step-for-step, and adding so much humor at the same time.  I think O'Connor is a better singer than Kelly and better suited to comedy.  Both work terrific together and each actor's strengths shine through.  And what a find Debbie Reynolds was!  I think she was only 17 when she made this movie, yet her singing and dancing talents are splendid.  I so wish they hadn't cut her solo scene, singing, &quot;You Are My Lucky Star&quot;.  Luckily, it re-appears in the extra material presentations of some later editions (at least on one VHS version that I know of).<br />Definitely add this movie to your collection, and keep an eye out for the Anniversary edition, reportedly due out later this year.  It will have plenty of DVD extra goodies.<br />In the end, a solid movie musical.  A few flaws, yes (the fantasy sequence with Cyd Charisse is incredible and groundbreaking, but just plain doesn't fit in the story line), and yet this gem shines as an enduring classic that should be in every collection.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|The idea of taking a fantasy figure from a computer game and creating a whole film around it is bold--how much plot could there be? But the writers and director found good material, if a bit shopworn, to make a fun-filled adventure flick that delivers plenty of entertainment.<br /><br />The plot is one you've seen before on Star Trek; a  dangerous weapon has been hidden to prevent man from destroying himself. It's being sought by the good guys (Lara) who want to destroy it, and the bad guys, the Illuminati, who want to use it. So, there isn't a lot of suspense, as you've seen this story before, but the adventure is fun and there's lots of eye candy.<br /><br />What makes this film so stunning are the special effects and sets. The sets inside the tombs are full sized, lending realism and excitement to the scenes. The film was made in exotic Ankor Wat, the world's largest temple complex, and in Iceland on the blue glaciers. In addition, Jolie does her own stuntwork, which makes a huge difference in the editing and realism. She was surprisingly good, very believable as the fantasy fighting babe Lara Croft.<br /><br />We enjoyed every moment. We were surprised how much we liked \\"Tomb Raiders\\" and especially Angelina Jolie. The extra bits at the end of the DVD on the making of the film are well worth watching
0060934719|5.0|There's an unexplainable magick about this book. Almost as if stardust was in it's pages. This is one of the very few books that has actually taken me completely away from reality. I had no concept of time or of the goings on around me while reading this book. Humorous, adventurous, romantic, and magickal. A classic that must be recognized. Gaiman is a master storyteller.
B00005JKCF|4.0|I have not seen the movie yet. The movie comes out in May in the USA. But in Puerto Rico where I live, The movies usually arrive here 2 or 3 weeks later. All that I have heard about Spider-Man is excellent. Even though I am a Batman & Superman fan all my life, the only Marvel character that I always liked was Spider-Man. If the movie is faithful to the original storyline, it should be a smash. Anytime you alter the original storyline, it suffers. Hope this review helps.
0679777547|5.0|Arturo Perez-Reverte is a mystery/thriller writer with a decidedly intellectual bent. When I first started looking for his work, I expected it to be in the general fiction or literature section of the book store, but finally found it listed under mystery. This is a wonderful book for people who like books in the way that antique people like the antiques roadshow on PBS. It revels in the details of book-making, old texts, and bindings. Lucas Corso, the main character, is trying to discover the link between a fragment of a Dumas manuscript and a possibly Satanic text.<br />Though the movie version, the Ninth Gate, goes whole hog on the occult angle, the book is more about the Dumas manuscript and its connection to the other book. This makes the movie really irrelevant to the enjoyment of the book, other than if you liked the general idea of the movie, then this book is surely for you.<br />If you like to go to second hand book stores, or you enjoy talking about an old book, or if you go to garage sales to look through the old books, then Club Dumas is your type of book. I like Perez-Reverte's ability to go off on small tangents as part of the story, as when he digresses to discuss the ways to restore an old book or insert pages to complete it ... this may not appeal to everyone, but he doesn't use anything that isn't essential to an understanding of the plot.
B000002J0B|5.0|Houses of the Holy is Led Zepplin's 5th album and the band does not loose any of its strength. The band does some of its greatest songs on this album like Over the Hills and Far Away and D'yer Maker. This is the album in which Zepplin moves away from its traditional blues/hard rock base to a more soothing sound.
B0000636UN|2.0|If you loved Sheryl's last two CDs like I did and highly anticipated her latest release, you are in for a huge disappointment.  <br />On the way home from buying the CD in a local store, I perused through the tracks in my car only to find a CD comprised of mostly flat, monotonous rhythm and elementary lyrics that are a bore.<br />If a CD could be returned for lack of artistic originality, I would have turned immediately around and taken it back to the store for a refund.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This is a film you will either love or hate. I \\"GOT\\" this movie. I may be one of the only few who did. I love this films theme and direction its unapreciated and ahead of its time. Just like Hitchcocks Virtago was in its time. Give it 20 or 30 years and it will catch on! I cared for the robot boy and what becomes of him on his journey just as I did for R2-D2 and C-3PO in Star Wars or the toys in Toy Story. I mean sure they aren't real but still I identify with them and feel for them. This is a masterpiece that is ahead of its time and didnt find its audience. If this film was made for just me and the handful of people who \\"got\\" it then so be it.
B00005PJ8I|5.0|Tom Hanks is really good in this heartwarming and sometimes emotional adventure movie with some comedy. Where he ends up in a tragic plane crash from the south pacific ocean. Suddenly he gets flown away in a rubber boat out to sea from the terrible rain storm and lands on a deserted tropical island. Hanks really knows and finds out what's going on? That there is no one there to help him but he's all alone by himself. So he must learn on how to survive without nobody else coming to save Hanks. But except only the skills thru his own knowledge and learns to think in a desperate situation for survival. I like one part when his best friend all covered by Hanks injured red blood on this volleyball which he calls and names it &quot;Wilson&quot;. While still being stranded on that island by opening a few delivery packages from the plane disaster he escaped out of. And another scene in this movie I loved where he starts hearing strange noises from the island coming from somewhere but it turns out just to be coconuts falling by a palm trees he notices!
B00003CXXP|5.0|This is a brilliant film, that goes on my list of the best films of the year (which also include &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; in case anyone cares).  The symbolism of everything in there (Dr. Know-we are only supposed to know what we are told to, just as he was programmed), not to mention the best retelling of Pinnochio ever makes this just so cool.<br />The special features are great as well.  All the revealing info about the movie and how it was made is so cool.  Now, if only Speilber wouldn't be as afraid to make commentaries of his films...
B00000G3Q4|4.0|If you want the living daylights scared out of you then rent or buy this DVD and watch it on a dark stormy night with a loved one.<BR>The story goes 5 college kids go vacationing (Tennesee I think)<BR>up in the mountains. They cross this rickety (It's solid as a rock girls) bridge thru the gloomy woods to this decrepit cabin.<BR>You've already heard the evil when they crossed the border and the steering wheel gets jerked out of Scotty's hand.<br />It isn't long before the kids go exploring down in the cellar after the door thumps open (by itself). They find a creepy looking book and a dagger along with a tape recorder.<BR>This is where the terror begins, they play the tape which has<BR>demonic funerary incantations on it.<BR>That night one of the girls (stupidly) ventures out into the foggy night. <BR>I'll stop here, she's first to become possessed, the other soon follow<BR>A truly scary flick, acting is good dialogue is lame <BR>camera work fine, SFX pretty good for budget<BR>way to go Sam !
B00005YW4H|3.0|On her official debut release, Come Away with Me, \\"jazz\\" vocalist Norah Jones evenly splits the difference between subtle and boring.  There's no escaping that she's a prodigious singer.  She feels her way into her material with grace, compassion and, best of all, intelligence.  She has none of the preening or pretentious overreach of similar artists like, to use one example, Cassandra Wilson.  Her gifts are in evidence on a broad range of material, from the Hoagy Carmichael chestnut \\"The Nearness of You\\" to Hank Williams's \\"Cold Cold Heart\\", both expertly rendered, to her own \\"Nightingale\\", the CD's premiere standout.  Still, I put jazz in quotes above because her phrasing never breaks an emotional sweat the way the greatest do (Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughn), and, for all its pedigree (the Arif Mardin production, the label affiliation), the CD could just as easily have been released by Windham Hill, who might better market its soporific qualities.
B00000JZJ0|4.0|You have to give Jeffrey Combs alot of credit in both Re-animator and Bride of Re-animator, I mean the guy manages to keep a straight face throughout both films. (Unless he was laughing his butt off between takes).<BR>This movie is downright cool and outrageous chasing after the modern day Frankenstein..um I mean Franken..oh nevermind.<BR>The story is simple the two docs build a woman from spare body parts. She says at one point..\\"You built me??\\" with the silly look on her face.<BR>My favorite scene was the fingers with the eyeball attached to it<BR>running around the room when that nosy cop was there giving the boys the 3rd degree. You'll like how he gets his..the die-electric detective..Anyway check it out plent of gore, silly dialogue oh and one fine looking babe.<BR>Thumbs up to H.P Lovecraft and his bizarre stories..yeah!
B00000IO4J|5.0|Visualise a world where authority is shifted from the hands of humans to an entirely diverse species: aliens from another planet. Welcome to Herrington High, where six students are about to face facts that 'aliens have taken over (their) school', where their teachers are now literally brain-dead.  <br />Jordana Brewster is the popular head cheerleader Delilah, Clea DuVall is the goth loner Stokely, Laura Harris is the mysterious newcomer MaryBeth, Josh Hartnett is the rebel leader Zeke, Shawn Hatosy is the star quarterback Stan, and Elijah Wood is the school geek Casey. Together they overcome all odds to maintain order and defeat the nightmarish paranoia and hysteria of a new alien world. <br />A Miramax International/Dimension Films presentation, directed by Robert Rodriguez and screenplay by Kevin Williamson, 'The Faculty' is 'From Dusk Till Dawn' meets 'Scream', a new science fiction thriller that will bring its audience into an alternate universe where humans are no longer the superiors. Witty, brilliant, and perfect for any sci-fi fans. Not to be missed.
630589938X|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst made movie of a Steven King<BR>novel ever.

0792153189|5.0|What would you do if all life on Earth would inevitably be destroyed in a few weeks? <br />By chance on a star-lit night in Arizona, a young astronomer, Leo Beidermann (Elijah Wood), makes the gut-wrenching discovery of an enormous comet on a path that would lead to a direct contact with the earth. Morgan Freeman is the President of the United States, whose responsibility is to address the nation with the heart-stopping E.L.E incident, an Extinction Level Event. Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) is a reporter who adds to the large scale storyline of the countdown to doomsday as humanity fights for their chance to survive. <br />Directed by Mimi Leder ('The Peacemaker') and accompanied by a highly talented cast also featuring Robert Duvall, Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell with music by James Horner, 'Deep Impact' explodes with an &quot;eye-opening blast of a movie experience&quot; (Jeff Craig, Sixty Second Preview). It is ultimately compelling, bursting with suspense, heartwarming, and unforgettable. <br />Recommended for any audience over 14 years, it is a tale where although oceans rise and cities fall, hope will always survive, making 'Deep Impact' a must-see movie.
0780622553|3.0|Don't be fooled by the insistent visual style.  This film is muddled, unpleasant, and rather pointless.  It's solidly worth 3 stars, but is really no more than a minor cult favorite.
B000001ABD|4.0|Stevie Wonder is one of the most spectacular artists still living today. I understand how hard it is to try to consolidate ALL of the major hits of such an artist. The task is mind-blowing. Yet you would think the people who put this together would at least start in a particular order (chronological maybe). Starting with square one is usually important, especially for new fans. After we're past that fact, then we see that they are missing some very important milestone songs. You might want to put an artist's first major hit on the album (FINGERTIPS)! Other songs were not nearly as important: &quot;Love's Light in Flight&quot;, &quot;Hold On to Your Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Hey Love&quot; to name a few could have easily been replaced with hits like: &quot;For Once In My Life&quot;, &quot;Knocks Me Off MY Feet&quot; or even &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot;.<br />    To 2 CD set's credit, there are some very commendable liner notes by someone obviously pretty educated (from Stanford). There are also rare songs like &quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot;, &quot;The Redemption Song&quot;, and quiet hits like &quot;That Girl&quot;, &quot;All I Do&quot;, and &quot;Kiss Lonely Goodbye&quot; which is not on the box set. This is a good CD if you just want to hear some Stevie Wonder (nothing wrong with that). For true fans, you may want to get a more extensive album (Looking Back, Essential, and At the Close of a Century). Although this CD set does not have everything, it has enough for me to say that I wouldn't trade it for the world. The rare tracks and selective arrangement make this an album to take into consideration.

Now if you're not particularly attracted by Penelope's radiant smile, I understand that you hesitate in front of this Fox presentation.<br />WOMAN ON TOP is a romantic comedy directed by the venezuelian born director Fina Torres in 2000. Add a little magic with the intervention of a Sea Goddess -Yemanja-, a brazilian orchestra with a few love songs in portuguese and two or three comic second characters like Monica the transvestite or Cliff the fitness addict TV producer and you'll have a funny comedy to rent.<br />Nothing special in the bonus features department with the usual trailers. Images and sound OK.<br />A DVD zone Pen&eacute;lope reserved shelf.
6305922756|5.0|What more can you say. This movie is a classic comedy on the world of Rock and Heavy Metal. If you have followed bands like Deep Purple, Judas Priest, Dio, Rainbow etc for years you will see what life was probably like on the road for these bands. <BR>Even after all these years I'm just amazed how well written this movie is.
0553579908|5.0|Other than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, I hadn't really had any exposure to the Fantasy genre, nor did I care to.  I'm more into more popular fiction.  A couple of years ago a friend recommended A Game of Thrones to me, which I quickly bought, but I never really got around to reading it until about a month ago.<BR>First off, Martin is just plain good at writing.  He is able to have 8 or 9 different characters have different storylines at the same time, but it doesn't get (too) confusing.  The action, though occasionally bloody at times (though it didn't really bother me), was taut and exciting, with both intimate close combat and vast overall battles portrayed clearly.<BR>Secondly, Martin has a bunch of characters you can actually care about, yet he doesn't favor any particular side.  Main characters are as likely to die as any of the supporting cast, and even the \\"good guys\\" have some negative qualities.<BR>As I said before, I haven't read much fantasy, but even basing my comparison on other fiction, this really is a great series.  Those with patience and a love of great writing should pick this up.  Can't wait for the third book to come out in paperback!
0345448898|5.0|When I first started this triology I was blown away with the authors ability to trasfer us to a world so much like ours and yet in some ways entirely different. As the triloy progressed and I learned more about the characters and the twisted lives they live it started to make me think how someone can overcome an obstical with such completeness that she can save the world; or in fact all the worlds. Throughout the books you not only see the plot unfold between your very eyes but you also have the chance to see the two main characters, Lyra and Will, grow up. The way the author presents the theroy of different worlds not only makes you think that we may not be alone but it also leaves you with a sense that we are all connecteted. I recomend this trilogy to anyone who likes fantasy and who isn't afraid of something new, and different.
068484267X|5.0|This is possibly one of the best memoirs of the last century... It tells of the life of Frank McCourt, ages 3-18. The book is wonderful and well-paced. It runs a bit long, but it is worth the time as every page is better than the next. I was personally shocked by some parts, because it describes the scenery so vividly it's almost haunting. The special thing is that Frank does not write this from an adult point of view, but from a child's, never writing what he regrets now or lamenting too much on his mistakes or tortures. I also read &quot;Tis&quot;, his second book about his life in New York, and i have to admit it's not as good, partly because he's all grown up and partly because Ireland thoroughly fascinated me... I would recommend this book to absolutely everybody.
8185300534|5.0|Rarely has there been a book with such simple statements with such profound meaning. What this man saying is very deep, but seems to have no practical value. Even the chapter titles speak for themselves; 'A Quiet Mind is all you Need', 'Abandon all memories and expectations', 'What pleases you keeps you back'. At the same time, while reading, my mind would feel a calm like never before. The book has the power to change people's lives, but in a good or bad way depending on the perspective. After reading, one might realize everything they have worked for in their life has been a useless endeavor. I seriously believe this man found greater truth than most people couldn't even imagine of having. But the real question is, what use are his words to you?? Its your call.
B00005K9LK|5.0|I had a cassette of this album when it was first released, and the remaster is Fantastic. The audio quality is excellent. Just like I remember only better. The tracks on this album have the \\"symphonic\\" quality that I love. Is this the \\"Brown Sound\\" that Eddie Van Halen refers too? The sound is huge and full. And the song writing, musicianship and original production add up to one fine album. Which I imagine is why this is was one of their biggest albums. JP's follow up to the less successfull Point of Entry, Screaming for Vengeance marks Judas Priest at their top form. This album's melodic and plenty heavy song stuctures, lyrical edge (that doesn't sound too ridiculous now that I'm 20 years older)and finely crafted rhythm and guitar hooks sink their teeth into you, rather than beat your forehead with a broom, like a lot of recent speed/thrash metal. The Helion/Electric Eye is fantastic. The intro, The Helion, hits with an atmospheric stab that fits the lyrics, while the song itself, Electric Eye, has a great rhythm guitar feel that doesn't stray too far from the blues influence Priest originally began with. Take These Chains stands out as a powerful melodic anthem. You've Got Another Thing Comin' is an example of the stripped down, rhythmic song structure Priest had adopted over time, a big change from their earlier, rather classically influenced compositions. The bonus tracks are about what you would expect of previously unreleased recordings, particularly Devils Child(live), but Prisoner of Your Eyes is good, an interesting look back at their Sin After Sin/Sad Wings style with a feel that doesn't seem too out of place on the album. Priest was at the height of their art here. They were the flagbearers of metal, the guys newer bands listed as their influence, and it's a shame they haven't recaptured the grandure of this album. From this point on they were playing catch-up with the guys they influenced (Metallica, Iron Maiden), or crawling out from under the hair ball that is '80's Glam. If people argue that JP had become too commercial by the time they recorded Screaming For Vengeance, I say, Priest had grown up, this album has conviction.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I've always liked this band, there last collection<br />wasn't up to their usual but still a good cd. This<br />new collection is very interesting, lots of different<br />produciton but it all gels, love what Rick O, Prince<br />and Sly and Robbie have done to invigorate this<br />group. Many great songs on this one and the singles<br />released aren't even the best! One of the best of<br />year.
B000002JPA|5.0|I first heard Dreamtheater in 1990 on a college radio station in New Haven, CT, and have been a huge fan ever since.  Many people in Germany, where I live now, are also huge fans, and the shows are amazing.  This is not their first CD, but it is their first studio-produced masterpiece.  All the songs blend together nicely, and the instrumentals are amazing-- guitar riffs and intense drums, etc.. If you like Iron Maiden, Queensryche, Fates Warning, Paegan Offering, Skyklad, etc.. you'll really enjoy this masterwork of progressive metal.
B0000028M7|5.0|Alice in Chains is one of those bands that crosses boundries between the fan/musicians communities. Mixing a dark Gothic mood with Led-Zepp style Heavy Metal has made for an original sound that has strangley become the main sound heard on rock radio in the early 2000's. Most of the current AIC imitators( Puddle of Creed/Godsmack/Drowning Pool, et al) are just sad excuses compared to the original, and are despised by a lot of musicians. But AIC is different and has big fan support/radio airplay as well as respect among musicians. <br />Most bands would kill to have a lead singer with as much soul as Layne Stayley (who unfortunately, finally succumbed to his long-term heroin addiction) and a guitar riff-monster like Jerry Cantrell. The songs sad, lonely, and desperate but beautiful and powerful at the same time. <br />Warning- This is not a party album that 14 year old girls will shake their Britney bon-bons to.  But for people who appreciate a big heavy guitar sound with well-written songs, great musicianship, and an unbelievable lead vocalist, Alice in Chain's \\"Dirt\\" is for you.
B0000019PA|5.0|While In The Aeroplane Over The Sea is playing, it's the only album in the world.  When it's not playing it's on permanent rotation in your head.  When something else is playing you must keep Neutral Milk Hotel out of your thoughts or the mere memory of these songs will make other music (even good music) seem impossibly pale and pointless.  <br /><br />Yep, at first you'll probably dislike Jeff's voice.  They're not joking when they say it sounds raw and untrained.  And it's not an untrained voice that murmurs softly, like Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse; Jeff Mangum sings strongly and forcefully, sometimes at the top of his lungs.  The album has a very particular sound.  I promise it does not sound like you picture it will sound based on reading reviews.  You will probably be kind of underwhelmed, after all this hype.  <br /><br />But.  Give it time.  Eventually you will &quot;get it&quot;.  And once you get it, there is no turning back.  Obsession sets in.  I think I have all these songs memorized note by note; I think I'll still be singing them in my mind after I'm dead.  If you believe you're familiar with the emotional effects music can have on you, well, you don't unless you've heard this album.  Most people seem to place it in a separate category from all the other music they know.  I'm a pretty jaded and rational person, but it's difficult to speak coldly and logically about these songs.  So much beauty, sadness and hope packed into such a small space... &quot;the world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves left beneath christmas trees in the snow I will take you and leave you alone watching spirals of white softly flow over your eyelids...&quot;  I have no idea what this means, so why does it move me to tears?<br /><br />Anyway, let's try to be rational again.  One reason people write such over-the-top reviews is that they want others to give Neutral Milk Hotel a chance.  Don't let the small minority of detractors give you second thoughts...you musthear it, seriously, just keep an open mind, don't expect pure brilliance to leap out and grab you at first, and give it several listens before you make up your mind.<br /><br />Jeff Mangum sings every tangled nonsensical line like he means it with all his soul.  I know you've heard that before, but you don't know how true it is until you hear the songs.  You know, his sincerity is so convincing that it only recently occurred to me that Jeff Mangum did not actually know Anne Frank, and there is no way that he could have known Anne Frank.  <br /><br />Like another reviewer said, &quot;Goodbye, objectivity&quot;--the best thing I've heard, to date.
B0000636UN|1.0|I loved &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; and &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot;. I excused her lackluster live album because I thought, &quot;no one ever sounds that great out of the studio.&quot; I was totally psyched for c'mon, c'mon, I could hardly wait to tear open the CD wrapper. When I popped it in and heard &quot;Steve MacQueen&quot;, I thought that it was going to be her normal, awesome stuff. Then, the already-boring &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; was next, so I skipped through to track three, in suspense about what would come next. &quot;You're an Original&quot; was so-so. &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; was good, but I figured it would be one of the slowest songs on her album. Then, THE REST. Everything sounded exactly the SAME! I was very dissapointed with the quality of this album. I realize that this was a tough three years personally for her, and her depressing music certainly reflects that.  What is even radio-worthy? &quot;Lucky Kid&quot; was pretty cool, but nothing I'd like to listen to over and over again. Sorry, Sheryl, i'm still a fan, but BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.
B00004XQ83|5.0|It was the sound that the Coen Brothers and record producer T Bone Burnette found when they visited Nashville in 1999 to find music for a movie they were about to produce. Mountain music, the Delta blues, Gospel and Chain gang songs make this release a &quot;one of a kind&quot; masterpiece.<BR>&quot;I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot; by The Soggy Bottom Boys is electrifying. &quot;Keep On The Sunny Side&quot; by The Whites is as pure as the morning dew in Dixie. <BR>You don't have to be a lover of bluegrass music to love this terrific soundtrack. It is nothing short of phenomenal.
B000002H70|5.0|Probably being one of the most influencial acts in the alternative rock scene, The Cure, in various forms led by Robert Smith, have produced albums so wonderful and different from one another that I was sometimes suprised that they were the same band.  To me, this album represents The Cure at their highest artistic form, with layers upon layers of sound and with Smith's haunting vocals.  Mixing driving beats with guitars, basses, and keyboards, they converge and make the music flow through your head like a murky river, but is never dull or boring. And floating along are vocals that carry the messages of the songs.  I really cannot point out a favorite song because I view the album as an artistic whole, with one sonic moment not to be missed.  This album is an extraordinary modern musical work.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Now I realize that this film is not going to be to everyone's taste. I suppose that it will fall under the category of Cult Film, yet in my opinion, 'A.I. - Artificial Intelligence' is one of the greatest science fiction films of the last ten years. In time it may very well be placed within the top twenty greatest Science Fiction films ever.<br />If you want something that is thoughtful, imaginative, daring and unique for a film. This film is a MUST SEE!<br />It's a shame that the public wasn't very receptive to this film last Summer, because they missed out on one of the better one's from 2001. Why?<BR> <BR>For a great many reasons. I won't go into more discussion over the fact that 'A.I.' was the posthumous collaboration between Spielberg  and Kubrick. A lot of space has already been written that covers that fact.<br />Many complained about the ending and the disjointed structure of 'A.I.', yet if you give the film a chance and pay attention from the first frame, the film  does tie together and make sense.<BR>It's Ironic, since many have complained about the disjointed structure of '2001:A Space Odyssey'. Frankly, the ending is one of the things that make it so strong. The film itself ties in well with Kubrick's sensibility of `Mode Shifting', in this respect 'A.I.' is similar to '2001'.<br />The film's look at the mysticism of Fairy Tales is something that Kubrick must have wanted to address. 'A.I.' is a parable about many issues, from Parenthood and Paternal instincts, to Religion, to hatred of people or things we don't understand, to ecological issues.  Above all, 'A.I.' is about the simplest of all things, it's message, it's warning is be very careful, take care of the families that you create. It does have a challenging undercurrent of ideas, moments that are disturbing throughout. From the Flesh Fair sequence, to Rouge City, to the underwater New York skyline  and the Excavation site ending.<br />Jude Law and Francis O'Connor do a wonderful job, yet it's Haley Joel Osment who carries this film with an Amazing performance. I have been a fan of his since 'The Sixth Sense' yet he outdoes himself in the role of David. The rest of the cast fills out the film nicely, William Hurt, Sam Robards, Brendan Gleason, Jake Thomas, as well as voiceover cameos by Robin Williams, Meryl Streep, Ben Kingsley, and Chris Rock. <br />Technically the film is nearly flawless, with a great production design, Januez Kaminsky's cinemaphotography, some great robot designs by Stan Winston, including Teddy. The visual effects by I.L.M. are seamless and probably some of the best work by George Lucas's company in awhile. No offense to Star Wars fans, but the effects in 'Phantom Menace' pales in comparison to 'A.I.'. John William's score is one of the highlights of the film and one of his best since 'Close Encounters'.<br />The film's ambition is something that isn't seen enough, it isn't much of a surprise that it had such a polarizing reaction with the viewing public last summer. The film was Kubrick's concept, with Spielberg as it's interpreter. After all, most of Stanley Kubrick's film's polarized the public upon their first theatrical release. Many still don't understand '2001:A Space Odyssey'.<br />I should mention the DVD does a great job with the layout and progression of the documentary features. My only mild complaint is the omission of a director commentary.<br />Can anyone really say that last summer's remake of 'Planet Of The Apes' will be something that will still be talked about, remembered and seen, twenty years from now?<BR>Can anyone really say that this year's Oscar nominee 'A Beautiful Mind' will be remembered in twenty years?  (No offense intended to `Apes' fans or fans of Ron Howard's film.) I'm not really sure about that, Perhaps, Perhaps not. Yet I think 'A.I.' will only grow in statue over time. That it will age better over time than its contemporaries. Much in the same way that Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' or Ridley Scotts 'BladeRunner' are now seen in a very different light.<br />'A.I.' is better with each successive viewing, get this film!<br />Sorry if this sounds like a press kit junket, but that's how I feel.
0736607358|3.0|This book is somewhere in between three and four stars.  First of all, the book's main weaknesses, in my opinion: the main character Arkady Renko is calm, collected and principled almost to the point of being dull.  While it was obviously the author's intention to make him straight-laced, it does not help the book much to have such an unrealistic character.  Likewise, the love scenes with Irina Asanova seem very strained and unrealistic.  But the plot is fairly good and should keep you reading (even if it is a bit of a disappointment in the end).  The character problems are not such a big issue in Polar Star and the plot (actually, two plots) and setting are even cooler.  If I was going to read one of these books again, it would definitely be Polar Star.
B00005QY5Y|3.0|I love New York, New York so I bought the album, but I don't think the rest of the album is nothing like NYNY, IMHO.  There are definitely a few great songs, like Answering Bell and When the Stars Go Blue.  It's a great mellow CD to listen at work or relaxing at home.
B00000HZFH|5.0|i'm originally from boise but had never listened to bts until my little brother put it in the cd player in my car a few weeks after it was released....<br />well after about 1,000 listens i can say that it is my favorite album of all time.  it didn't really hit me how great it was until at one point i realized i must have played it in my car about 100 times.  to me that is the sign of a truly great album, one that doesn't just reach out and grab you right off, but rather gets better and better with each listen.  very different from &quot;perfect from now on,&quot; which makes it hard to compare the two, so i will refrain from saying this one is better although it finds its way into my cd player more often.<br />the only song i ever fast forward is &quot;bad light.&quot;  by far my favorite part of the album is the intro to &quot;time trap.&quot;  (they performed the song on hbo's reverb and it was even better live, i have no idea why it wasn't included on the &quot;live&quot; album)  also &quot;you were right&quot; and the first 4 tracks are outstanding.
B00003CWTH|5.0|Okay, here's the deal:  I first saw \\"Magnolia\\" in the theater and hated it.  By the time I left the multiplex, my patience was gone (typical multiplex experience), my butt was numb (ditto), and my head hurt.  It is this last which made me buy the DVD on pure impulse when it first hit the shelves.  It has since become one of my favorite movies and is one which I definitely recommend one see at home as opposed to in the theater.  Why?  One word:  Intermission.  Paul Anderson probably would've won my immediate and undying respect had he given the audience a bit of a breather.  I mean, let's face it, nobody enjoys sitting in a multiplex seat for over three hours.  Older films such as \\"Dr. Zhivago\\" and \\"Once Upon a Time In America,\\" to name just two, seemed to understand this.  At home you can (and should) take at least one fifteen minute break.  I recommend this not only for the opportunity it offers to get one's head together but because it will allow you to discuss the film with whoever you happen to be watching it with or at least give some thought to what is being said and what is being done if you happen to be on your own.  Trying to take in all of \\"Magnolia\\" in one uninterrupted sitting is like trying to take in a five course meal without a break.  Does it look good?  Absolutely!  Taste good?  Absolutely!  Leave you feeling so stuffed you feel like you're about to go into cardiac arrest?  Absolutely!  Hopefully Mr. Anderson will take a lesson next time and go ahead and tack on an extra ten or fifteen minutes to allow his audience a chance at some digestion.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Princess mononoke has been my favorite anime since the time I saw it. With its excellent animation voice overs that beat all others and suspense that makes your heart skip princess mononoke was (and is) a master piece.<br />I never thought I?d see a better Anime, Until I saw Akira. Akira is my all time favorite Anime and one of my favorite Movies of all time. I don?t know what they added in the special edition but I don?t how it could be any better.<br />Akira is about a teenager who gets involved with a biker gang. He comes in contact with a weird telepathic kid. After a while strange things start happening to him.<br />Animation:10/10. This movie was supposedly made in the late 80?s. well it has animation like it was made in 2039. The back grounds seem more detailed than actual life and the characters move smoothly across the screen.<br />Plot:10/10. Well I already told you the basic plot. I?ll just take this time to tell you what a amazing suspencful and brilliant plot akira has. Ahem. It has a good plot.<br />Sound:9/10. The dub is superb and the voices are excellent and match the characters. Most of the music is good except for this one obnoxious sounding song. Don?t worry, it only lasts like 5 seconds.<br />Overall:10/10. Tihs film is exceptional. What else can you say? It was done perfectly and (slightly) better than princess mononoke.

B00005T30L|3.0|after hearing all the great buzz about 'Ghost World', i decided to check it out with some friends one night.  thank god we rented it, instead of buying or shelling out the cash to go see it in the theater.<br />Steve Buscemi gives one of the best performances of his career (he's the reason for at least 2 of the stars for this movie) as an aging outcast loner.  going completely against his usual type of either freaky comedic relief or freaky creep, he turns in a very emotionally engaging performance.  we end up feeling for this guy and really honestly wish that his life could have ended up better.<br />aspects of this movie were smartly hilarious.  in one scene, a sunburnt idiot loitering outside of a convenience store ends up in a physical fight with the store's owner:  his inexpertly swung nunchucks against the exasperated shopkeeper's ratty old mop.<br />while the first half of the movie got the occasional laugh, the rest sort of just melted and went nowhere.  the plot fizzles out by then end, leaving the viewer completely unsatisfied with the conclusion.  the near-pedophilia relationship between the aging Buscemi and the high-schooler Thora Birch was also rather unsettling.  overall, the movie is kind of slow and shallow, and takes itself way too seriously.

B000001IPL|2.0|Ok, this is Offspring's best. But the trouble with releasing an album with 14 songs is that, unevitably, by the middle of the album the band generally is running out of steem. This is the case with SMASH. After being pleasantly surprised by the beginning, the listener wil rapidly get bored with the huge quantity of songs using the chorus &quot;OOOOÔOOOOOOO&quot;...
B000053ZRR|5.0|This band is still rocking after all of this time. They rule!
B00000634J|1.0|Just another compilation trying to cash in over the great John Lennon.Sad.
B000002C2E|5.0|I am quite new to Bob Dylan, and I consider him to be nothing less than a musical icon. I would go as far as to say this is his best album - he is at his most emotional and honest here. These songs comforted me during a rough time in my personal life. They are written fantastically, sung beautifully, played with pure passion - and the production is also note worthy. The best songs? Love Sick, Not Dark Yet, Standing in the Doorway... in fact they're all so good, I couldn't choose just one as my favorite. Sheer class.
B000050X31|5.0|The most striking in this production is Manfred Hamm's Papageno. He is a great singer and especially a great comic actor. The comic effects are also directed well. The dance by Monastatos' slaves after they get enchanted by Papageno's magic bell (well, a Zauberding) is very humorous because of the straight-faced choreography (the humorous effect is better than most productions I've seen). Serra is very good as the Queen of the Night (although Edita Gruberova recorded with Teldec the best \\"Queen\\" I've ever seen, but that recording isn't availble in video format). Battle is a likeable and apt Pamina, and Araiza and Moll are good in their parts. Eva Lind's Papagena is cute and very energetic. The set is not extravagent by any means but serves the purpose. This is the best Magic Flute available. <br />The Magic Flute, a great masterpiece in opera history, of course, has a deliberately contradictory plot and motif, if you know the story. Some of the stuff, if you think about it, is (intentionally) ridiculous. For example, how can a prince who fainted upon seeing the giant snake be entrusted to save the abducted Pamina? Watch it a few times and you'll start feeling the deliberation in the music too, which is magical.
0441008356|4.0|This book has much that is admirable about it.  Most stricking is the number of fresh ideas that Reynolds manages to cram in without making the plot incoherant.  His ability to tie the various strands of those ideas and the plot elements he uses to present those ideas is remarkable.  He also proves to have a mastery of the English language that many first novelist do not.  On the down side the characters, though sometimes complex, are not compeling.  Indeed most are driven people who do dispicable things in search of thier goals.  The plot, especially early on is difficult to follow.  The pacing and structure does improve greatly in the second half of the book but it was difficult to work through until that point.  Even with those downsides I still found this to be a enjoyable and worthwhile read.  The ideas around which the book centers (as well as many other great ideas that are simply used to flesh out the book's world) are fresh enough and compeling enough to make up for the few weeknesses.  A strong recomendation for fans of hard scifi.
B00005JGAB|5.0|If the United States were to bury a time capsule, the music representative should be this record.  Not only is it great to listen to on an induvidual basis, but it's importance to popular music today is incredible.  Johnny's roaring guitar fuzz, Dee's Dee's heart stomping bass, and Tommy's pulsating drumming capped off by Joey's vocals kickstarted an entire new musical genre.  At a time when popular music was dominated by bands like Led Zeppelin and Rush playing eight and nine minute songs with four minute pointless guitar solos, as well as that thing called disco, the Ramones took rock and roll back to what it was in the first place, a simple and fun song.  That is what this album is, a collection of real rock and roll songs.  These sound quite simply like Beatles-esque songs played very loud and very fast.  This record is essential for any comprehensive collection.
B00003CXTG|2.0|When I saw it at the theater with a group of other middle aged friends, I enjoyed it; but watching it again alone in my living room, I felt like, why bother??  Being with my friends the first time gave me the opportunity to voyeour their watching it.<br />While some of the characters and events in the film are true, the love story aspect was just too sappy.  Give me a break.  Danny dies and Raf gets the girl, the baby and the happily ever after.  <br />The love story really distracted from the story line.  Special effects were good, though, as well as the music.  I bought the soundtrack hoping to relive some of the 40s magic, but it was mostly orchestral with just that one song by Faith Hill.  I had to find another CD with classic 40s music to enjoy.
B00000DGUM|1.0|I really thought the disc was bad.  Seriously, I thought something was wrong with it.  I pulled out my original cd's and compared and I swear that they [messed] this disc up.  <br />Not to mention that the remix stuff is really terribly [messed] up.  Was Sebastian the only one in the band that could hear?  The bass is so loud in the mix you need to turn it down to play it. BTW Dont even go their I have top of the line equipment. <br />Bottomline, its worth it if you are a fan and want some unreleased material. Otherwise it [stinks]!! <br />Badvox
B000006E17|2.0|Though theoretically I would recommend this film, it is by no means very good.  Some believe it to be Pasolini's brilliant depiction/indictment of fascist Italy and the cathloc church, but I see it as Pasolini's greatest mistake.  The film begins well enough, (sparing any details) I will say that it starts out a well concieved commentary, but soon the film gets lost in an utterly pointless, and indulgent work of sexual preversion, rape, and violence.  Though I admit, it was these features that originally drew me to this film.  I was told it was one of the most shocking, disgusting films ever.  This statement peaked my curiosity, but now, after having seen it for myself, I do certainly believe it to be both shocking and disgusting, but this is not why I criticize it.  I was upset that the violence and sexual degregation of this film were without any true meaning or message.  I understand Pasolini's intended message, but I saw none of it in the film.  So why do I recommend it?  Because after all of it I am glad that I saw it, and I think that other should have the chance.  Not as much to see a good movie, as to see what was behind one of cinema's greatest controversies, from one of cinema's finest artists.
B0000636UN|5.0|I've been a long time fan of Sheryl Crow and couldn't wait for her new album to hit stores and I wasn't dissappointed. This album is amazingly good, as good as Sheryl's ever been. The whole CD is worthy of attention from the rockin' &quot;Steven McQueen&quot; to the beautifully sad &quot;Weather Channel.&quot; Sheryl's mixture of other talented artists makes the album even more powerful and unique. Not to mention the use of my favorite actress Gwyneth Paltrow on the love song &quot;It's Only Love&quot;.<br />Highlights (and there are many) include:<br />&quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot;- The first single has all the power to go to the top, it's got great lyrics and a catchy beat and chorus. It reminds me of &quot;Everyday is a Winding Road&quot;<br />&quot;Safe and Sound&quot;- This is just one amazing song that just takes you in and doesn't let go. Crow graces the piano on this ballad and lets the emotions run free.<br />&quot;C'mon C'mon&quot;- The title track is truly an amazing heartbreaking love song with the talented Stevie Nicks. The combination of these two amazing women makes the song a powerhouse.<br />&quot;You're an Orginal&quot;- Crow teams up with rocker Lenny Kravitz another one of my favorite artists to bring a rock heavy song that shows both Sheryl and Lenny's talents.<br />&quot;Lucky Star&quot;- This is another rockin song that reminds you that Crow is still the party girl. With the chorus screaming &quot;Wasted&quot; you're sure to have fun listening to this great song.<br />Over all this CD is amazing and shows what an amazing talent Crow truly is. Go buy this CD!
B00005RYL9|4.0|The disc transfer is excellent, and the disc is loaded with extras. This disc sets an example for all DVD makers to follow, and is again an example that Anchor Bay takes great care in it's DVD's.<BR>The tin can in which the DVD is packaged is a nice touch, and it is decorated with a sword imprint.<BR>The booklet I am not pleased with. Thge actual info is too short, and almost half the booklet is used as advertising material.<BR>A question arises in the choice of bonus tracks on the extra CD however, surely &quot;Who wants to live forever&quot; would have fit in better?<br />Still this is possibly the best possible DVD this movie could have, it *is* The One.

B00003CWRX|5.0|This film has been described as a David v Goliath story about the exposee of big tobacco, which it certainly is, but what made this picture such an emotional experience was that beneath the surface, was an intimate story of personal struggle among two men, Jeffrey Wigand(Crowe) and Lowell Bergman(Pacino).  <br />Jeffrey Wigand, the proud, reluctant family man, who went about in blowing the whistle on his former employers, Brown & Williamson, was not protrayed as the typical crusader out to do good for the right cause.  He was shown with all of the flaws of human frailties present that contributed to the realism of the movie.  The motivation for him to particiapte in an exposee of Brown & Williamson was strictly to preserve his pride as a man of integrity and most of all, to protect his manhood and prevent castration from the powers that be.  His reasons for going public were not noble and were not for the right reasons.  It was the way the film gave him a full arc in which he began to shape into a real hero doing what he did for the right reasons, made it a movie with great depth and brutal honesty.<br />Aside from those qualities, another admirable quiality about this film were the photography and visual compositions.  The visual style this movie carried was just absolutely amazing.  And it wasn't obstrusive to the story or overly-stylized.  Every composition and color scheme were there to add to the atmosphere and storytelling.  Michael Mann's minimalist compositions reminded me of Michelangelo Antonioni's work that gave this film the detached feeling and presence it required in revealing the anti-social personality and confusion of Jeffrey Wigand.  Director MAnn and Dante Spinotti is definitely up there with other frequent dynamic duo Director/DP teams like Steven Spielberg with Janusz Kaminski, Coen Bros. with Roger Deakins, Anthony Minghella with John Seale, Wong Kar Wai with Christopher Doyle, and so on.
0061008079|3.0|I have been wanting to read a Woman of Substance for a long time.  It actaully took three tries for me to get past the first couple of chapters.  I felt this was another retread of Gone With the Wind, rather than anything new.<br />I will admit that I finished the book and found it an ejoyable read, but had the following quandries about it.  The opening scene seems hard to follow and offers little character development.  It makes the book more confusing, rather than enhancing it.  The story was forgetable.  I had to keep remininding myself who the characters were.  Finally, Emma, the protagonist is simply not a likable individual.  I had little intesrest in her, did not feel her motivation was clear and founs her to be rather cold- not a heroine I enjoyed.<br />If you likes the business aspect try Jeffrey Archer's As the Crow Flies instead.  That is a far superior tale of one man's quest to create an ENglish shopping empire.

B00001OH7Y|5.0|I was initially a bit wary of picking up this album due to the time it was released (1980), as I tend not to like the music of that period. But, as the avid Bowie fan I am, I picked it up anyways, and I am very glad I did. The first thing I noticed was some irony that the CD was entitled scary monsters and the inside pictures feature Bowie in a clown suit. But anyways, onto the music. I'll agree with another reviewer and say that the weakest track is the opener, but that's really nothing to be afraid of, seeing how it grows on you very quicky. After being a bit skeptic, this album has quickly become one of my favorite of Bowie's. You'll love \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" \\"Teenage Wildlife\\", \\"Scream Like a Baby\\".. and heck, the whole album. There's a whole lot of symbolism in this album, so if you're an avid Bowie fan like me you'll really appreciate all the tie ins (especially \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" for all of you who love Major Tom) to his life and everything else. Of course, if you're new to Bowie, the songs are still awesome as just songs. This one should not be missed by anyone.
0140185232|5.0|I read this book as a child, but retained little of it, though it struck a chord. While re-reading the book, I was delighted to find it better than I'd remembered.  It fed a spiritual part of me.  Very very rarely does a novel transcend entertainment to satisfy a need and shift the perspective on daily life.<br />If Larry did represent an actual person in Maugham's aquaintance, then I would say the ripples of his stone thrown in the river had reached me.  Sweet testement to the life of a socialite, soldier, miner, farm hand, philospher, yogi and perhaps, eventually, a cab driver.
B00001OH7O|3.0|Funny, it's hard to know what to say about about this particular album. It's a good one, to be sure. Not my favorite of Bowie's work, but still definately a classic. &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;Oh! You Pretty Things&quot; are lots of fun, as are &quot;Life on Mars?&quot; and &quot;Kooks&quot;. Come to think of it, I would love to hear a modern version of Life On Mars. This album is very lyrical, which is fine, I suppose. But oftentimes what draws me back to music is the tunes, not the words. This is an essential part of anyone's Bowie Collection, but if you're just a casual  Bowie-goer, well then it's impossible to make a recommendation because David Bowie is the Rock and Roll Chameleon, his style is ever changing, but there is bound to be something you like. My suggestion: become a Bowie addict like everyone else and get this album.(funny, I've never met anyone who was just casually interested in Bowie, but I'm assuming that somewhere out there, there just might be..unless of course you count the Labyrinth)
B00005O5JV|5.0|OK, so I wasn't even going to rent this movie, I was sure it was another big-breasted-blond-chick-wearing-expensive-cute-clothing-does-good movie,but my friend who actually attends REAL law school in DC said it was really funny, so I rented it.  And I loved it, so much so that I went out and bought it afterwards (on sale mind you), and I have actually watched it more than once since I purchased it, which is always a good sign for a movie.  ...  It has Jennifer Coolidge (of Stifler's mom and Best In Show fame) as a non-sexually charged (gasp!) manicurist, Owen Wilson's (Hansel in Zoolander) little bro is in it as a dreamy hot smart guy with a heart, there's a UPS guy wearing shorts, and a  Harvard sweater wearing Chihauhau.  What more do you need?  Watch it, you'll like it.
B00000055E|2.0|this was my least favorite 2pac album.  that doesnt mean it wasnt good.  it was.  but i thought it was a dissappointment. some of the songs were pretty whack.  there were a lot of songs that i really liked.  disc 1 contained most of the good songs like open fire, r u still down, where do we go from here, ... i wonder if heaven got a ghetto, nothng 2 lose, and my favorite on disc 1 hellrazor.  that song was deep and real.  disc 2 songs were pretty bad with the exception of i wonder if heaven got a ghetto remix, when i get free II, ... enemies with me, ready 4 whatever and my favorite only fear of death.  i think i would have been better if 2pac hadnt of changed his voice like that.  when i first bought it i listened to it for about a week then i went back listening to other 2pac cds.  overall i think afeni shakur did a poor job producing the album.  i think if suge knight had produced it with her it would have been A LOT better.  <BR>by 2pacs #1 fan
6304712936|5.0|How can you loathe someone you adore the most? How can you conspire against the very person that you grew to admire? How can you strangle the same talent you consider divine?<br />Salieri says it very well, &quot;And now the madness began in me. The madness of a man splitting in half. Through my influence, I saw to it &quot;Don Giovani&quot; was played only five times in Vienna. But in secret, I went to every one of those five! Worshipping sound I alone seemed to hear!&quot;<br />This is not a documentary about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's life, neither a tribute to his great music. This is a masterpiece about the dilemma of hating what you love! It is a story about how extreme admiration can turn into horrid hatred!<br />An elderly Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) tells this story about him and Mozart like stories were never told! Salieri summarizes his rise in the music world until he reached the top, and then the story kicks in right when Mozart started bumping him on the road to immortality! Salieri had acheived the position of the Court Composer in Vienna. He had the wealth, the looks, the charms, and respect. He had it all but the superior talent! He was okay, but not remarkable! He thought that he had all that he ever wanted, until he met Mozart! He realized that all the materials he is surrounded with don't give him the talent that he craves for! His feeling of weakness is immense when he realizes that what he antagonize over composing doesn't come up half as good as what Mozart composes in the matter of seconds! Salieri, driven by envy, decides to fight. But he's not fighting Mozart... He's fighting god! He's fighting god because he didn't give him the talent, but he gave him the ability to see it! Like a hungry man staring at food behind bars! He saw in his clash with Mozart the chance to take revenge from god!<BR> <BR>I can find no words to explain how great this movie is. I'm not a fan of opera, but I do enjoy classical music, only the really good ones though. And even though this movie had so many clips of operas, yet you hardly find them boring or dull because they integrate with the story telling very well. The utilization of Mozart's music in the movie is astonishing! Mozart's talent is very well demonstrated throughout the movie. <br />Salieri explains Mozart's music very well in the movie when he says, &quot;On the page it looked nothing! The beginning simple... almost comic! Just a pulse... bassoons, basset horns... like a rusty squeezebox. And then, suddenly high above it, an oboe... A single note, hanging there, unwavering... Until a clarinet took it over, sweetened it into a phrase of such delight. This was no composition by a performing monkey. This was a music I had never heard! Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing. It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of god!&quot;<br />Abraham's performance is unmatchable! This is the first movie I watch over and over just to enjoy the performance of an actor!<br />It is also a lengthy movie, but by the end you find yourself wishing that this movie doesn't end!<br />If you want to watch a movie that'll haunt you for days and phrases from it would keep ringing in your ear, then watch Amadeus. You won't regret it.
1573225517|5.0|Most readers of this book probably come to it as a result of having seen the film.  This is again a prime example of why books are most always better than the movies that come after them.  Hornby's novel contains a deep insight into the modern male.  Rob twists and turns through the issues the grip most men his age: relationships, sex, music, and what he is going to do with his life.<br />The book is deliciously filled with many very funny jokes and the scenes of Rob getting in contact with the Top 5 break-ups he has ever had are priceless.  These are only made better by the scenes in the record store, helping us to understand a man and the way he interacts with his friends.<br />Hornby may be the greatest analyst of the male to come along in a long time.  I  know there were many times when I caught myself thinking \\"That is sooo true.\\"  Treat yourself to the book if you are a fan of the movie.  You will discover why the movie was so good and get a deeper glance into what made Rob so compelling.  If you are new to High Fidelity, you will not be disappointed.  Hornby is a master craftsman.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I saw his live show in Boston,MA and it was AWESOME!!  Not only did he play a few songs off his new album but he played allot of Beatles songs as well as a good selection of Wings tunes.Believe it or not he played for almost three hours!! Paul did a really nice tribute to John Lennon and a really funny one to George Harrison by playing \\"Something\\" on the ukulele!! He also did really good versions of \\"BlackBird\\" and \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" and he did a spectacular version of \\"Live And Let Die!\\" In short,It was a really good show and a great album and i can't wait 'til he comes around Boston again!
B000002UA9|5.0|With &quot;A 1,2,3,4,&quot; history was made with the rousing opening number, &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; from Please Please Me, the debut album of the best group the world has had the pleasure to experience.<br />&quot;Misery&quot; has the rhythm guitar that became part of the Beatles' signature style.  At least in the early days.  I wonder if Helen Shapiro set fire to her coiffure after turning this great number down--it was originally offered to her.<br />&quot;Anna (Go To Him)&quot; is an archetypal 60's type ballad originally done by R&amp;B singer Arthur Alexander.  Beatles renditions of other Alexander songs appear on the Live At The BBC album.<br />Their rendition of the Cookies' &quot;Chains&quot; shows they do justice to the works one of America's best songwriters, Carole King and Louise Goffin.<br />&quot;Boys&quot; is classic rollicking rock and roll and sung by Ringo, and one of two Shirelles numbers done here--the other is the slow and languid &quot;Baby It's You,&quot; the song beginning with &quot;Sha la la la la la la.&quot;<br />The centerpiece of this album is the title track, which became the Beatles' first #1 hit on the British charts--it only reached #3 in the U.S.  Anyone who wonders why the Beatles made it big need only hear this song.  Love that harmonica inbetween the verses!<br />The &quot;Love Me Do&quot; version here is not the originally recorded single version which reached #17 on the British charts and #1 on the Billboard Singles Chart.  Rather, this has Andy White on drums while Ringo is relegated to tapping a tambourine.  For the version that hit the single charts, get Past Masters Volume I.  I like both versions all the same.<br />&quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; is sung by Paul and is the first song on where he sings solo--he sings with John on the previous songs.  The other song where he sings solo is on the ballad &quot;A Taste Of Honey,&quot; singing of honey &quot;tasting much sweeter than wine.&quot;<br />It's George's turn to sing lead on &quot;Do You Want To Know A Secret.&quot;  The backing vocals after the second verse provide a nice touch.<br />Two rollicking numbers signal the close of Please Please Me, both sung by John.  They are &quot;There's A Place&quot; and the definitive rendition of the Isley Brothers' &quot;Twist And Shout.&quot;  I wonder how long it took John's vocals to recover after nearly singing himself to shreds.<br />Many artists would not have come to be without the Beatles, and we have this album to thank for.rn to sing lead on &quot;Do You Want To Know A Secret.&quot;  The backing vocals after the second verse provide a nice touch.<br />Two rollicking numbers signal the close of Please Please Me, both sung by John.

6300183971|5.0|Lynches version of the classic by Frank Herbert sure beats the the new souped up version that hit cable TV a few years ago. Although I admit that it might not have as much in the area of special effects. The villain Baron Harkonen was definately much more gross and dasterdly watch them both and youl see what I mean and I dont know it was more spiritual somehow.The book is very spiritual so i think the movie should be as well. Whatever! I liked it better than the new one.
B000002KY8|5.0|Looking back, I don't know if we were ever that close to nuclear war, but Prince put out a double-LP worth of songs (due to the plethora of long songs) back in 1982 and declared that he was gonna \\"party like it's 1999.\\"  That album made 17 years before the title year is one of Prince's most vital, danceable, and best albums.<br />\\"1999\\" is one of Prince's masterpieces, punctuated by punchy synthesizers and an infectious percussive beat, with Cold War nuclear angst lyrics:  \\"Everybody's got a bomb/we could all die anyway.  Jill Jones, keyboardist Lisa Coleman, and guitarist Dez Dickerson all have guest vocal duties.  The song closes with a poignant child-like question \\"Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?\\"  Why indeed?<br />That classic number is followed by \\"Little Red Corvette,\\" the highest charting single from this album, and rivalling \\"1999\\" in importance, career-wise.  Using a hot red car as a metaphor to a red hot, love'em and leave'em lover before AIDS was a concern works.  Lisa and Dez have more co-lead vocal contributions here.<br />\\"Delirious\\" follows with an infectious backbeat and squeaky keyboards.  Hey, I don't know how else to describe it, okay?<br />Things get a little bit hotter with \\"Let's Pretend We're Married,\\" hotter meaning explicit content.  I've no doubt that it was the single edit that was played on the radio and not the unexpurgated version here.  As this is an unabashed paean to free love, the line \\"all the hippies sing together\\" is apposite.  It also paraphrases the 60's slogan, \\"if it feels good, do it.\\"  Key lyric:  \\"My baby's gone and she don't care at all/And if she did, so what, come on baby, let's ----.\\"<br />\\"D.M.S.R.\\" continues the party but with a funkier tone, handclaps, synthesizers, and in a more fun, Bacchanalian vein.<br />For a song to clock in over nine minutes, it had better be good.  Well, \\"Automatic,\\" though not as rowdy as \\"D.M.S.R.\\", is compelling even at its great length.<br />\\"Free\\" starts out as a ballad before exploding into a gospelish-style number.  If John Stuart Mill ever needed a song to associate to, this would be it.  Prince is ever the populist, civil libertarian, and this is his best political song.  The song tells us to be glad that we are free compared to other countries in the world.  What about Holland or Denmark?  For those worried about the denting of our personal liberties in the wake of 9-11, these lyrics seem apropos:  \\"Soldiers are a marching they're writing brand new laws/We will all fight together for the most important cause/Will we all fight for the right to be free?\\"  And I'm NOT referring to the terrorists!  A wonderful song, with backing vocals courtesy of Jill Jones, Lisa, Vanity, and Wendy Melvoin.<br />Prince then asks a \\"Lady Cab Driver\\" (Jill Jones) to take him away from his \\"trouble winds [that] are blowin hard\\" and back to her place, where some heavy action takes place.  It would be more appropriate to call Jill's lines, \\"sounds.\\"  Yes, THOSE kinds of sounds.  Come on, this is a Prince album!<br />\\"International Lover\\" is done in the same vein as Controversy's \\"Do Me Baby.\\"  He uses the analogy of a pilot inviting a passenger aboard, flying to one's destination, and preparing to land an airplane to a date and sex.

B00005NDEO|5.0|Straight off, if you like your rock heavy and angry, with no frills, this is not for you.  Queen utilise their extraordinary talents in this, arguably their best album, to produce varying styles of song.  The amazing thing is that they do all of these styles very well for example a country song immediately leaps into a ballad, that leads into a rock song, followed by a Noel Coward-esque ditty.  All in all, it is a very exciting musical experience, and the effects that guitar deity Brian May manages to produce are second to none.  And oh, it's got Bohemian Rhapsody on it as well.
B000002B2T|5.0|Unbelievable talent!  These guys put this together out of their love of the music and friendship and it shows.  Lane Staley and Barrett Martin are exceptional!  I recomend this album for any music lover.
B0000636UN|5.0|On Sheryl Crow's fourth studio album, she varies a bit on style but never on talent.  From beginning to end C'mon C'mon takes you on a musical ride that can and will be enjoyed all throughout the summer and beyond.  From the rocking riffs of &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; and &quot;You're An Original&quot; to the pop flavored &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; and the melon cholly &quot;Weather Channel&quot;, Sheryl keeps the listeners interest with crafty perfectly timed production as well as cool vocals and incredible guests.  Stevie Nicks, Don Henley, Lenny Kravitz, Natalie Maines from the Dixie Chicks, Liz Phair, Emmylou Harris, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Doyle Bramhall II are wonderful additions...but Crow definately shines on her own.  On C'mon C'mon Sheryl Crow emerges from her beautiful masterpiece the Globe Sessions, with a happier disposition, but the same great talents.  C'mon C'mon is definately a keeper!!
B00005QDW1|1.0|no doubt is showing the world a completely different side--the side that has no talent...  i bought it expecting quality and was shocked at the lack thereof.  if you like no doubt's earlier material...don't buy this.  you will get a good laugh the first listen through...but you will never want to listen to it again despite the comedic value.  im actually pretty embarrassed i bought it.  this is the epitome of [bad] music.<br />it may even be worse than britney spears...
1563890119|5.0|A complex, moving storyline. Emotional, engrossing, imaginative, totally absorbing. The *whole series* is a must. Highly recommended.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I am a fan of the movie so I have tried to rate the DVD on its DVD merits only. I consider the  picture and sound quality first class.  The extra features are great.  Overall I rate this as a very nicely put together DVD.
0375701427|3.0|The sad this about this book is that is has so much potential.  What a compelling story it COULD have been:  the perfect, all-american family and how it deals with a terrorist daughter.  Yet, Roth insists on just skimming the surface of this issue, and fills in the cracks with tangent upon tangent.  He's just too long-winded for my taste.  Example: I honestly didn't think I could get through the first 100 pages, where a childhood acquaintance recounts just how wonderful the main character (the \\"Swede\\") was in high school.  One would think a writer would run out of ways to say \\"he was popular and athletic\\".  But Roth takes 100 pages to say this!  I'm not exaggerating!  He just repeats himself OVER and OVER.
0792833236|5.0|This is De Niro at his best.  You're following Jake La Motta through thick and thin.  What made this movie something unique were the shots in the ring.  You feel like you're right there taking and giving punches.  Does it get any better with De Niro and Pesci teaming up.  Wow, what a film.  You see these new blockbuster films and you realize that this is better than them.  What a challenge gaing all of that weight too.  The only thing that I don't care for are the lack of features on this DVD.  I don't feel cheated or anything, but I feel that there could have been some kind of featurete or interviews.  The sermon is over.

And due to the abyss that was created from Lord Asriel's campaign against the Authority, all the worlds' Dust is in danger of passing into oblivion, destroying all conscious life. To stop this from happening, all of the windows, created with the Subtle Knife, in all the worlds, must be closed. <br />The lovers, Lyra and Will, reluctantly accept that this has to be, and that they will be parted from each other for the rest of their lives in their own worlds where they and their daemons can enjoy a long life. But, as a compromise, the window that was created from the world of the Dead into the world of the Mulefa can be left open so that, like the ghosts that Lyra and Will have set free, they, too, will someday be re-united.<br />There is quite a lot in the Amber Spyglass and its precursors to criticise. Mostly this would be to do with logical clarity and consistency from one book to the next, and the ever present misuse of mixed viewpoint. But would the nephews really notice these details. <br />Probably not. And this is because they would be unlikely to persevere with a set of titles that really need to be considered as one long twelve hundred page book in order to get a hang of the inter-relationships. Simply skimming the action highlights wouldn't be recommended, since many of the highlights are only relevant when a subtle tie in from somewhere else is applied. Skimming would mean that they would miss a lot of the story's goodness. Compounding the problem is the schematic quality of many of the techno-thoecratic details that are also slightly contradictory, which, to the more experienced eye gives the impression of window dressing, they being too vague to spend the time on to make satisfactory sense of.<br />All that aside, I did enjoy the three books overall. Philip Pullman's writing is very consistent in quality from the start of The Golden Compass to the end of The Amber Spyglass. But he could have spared the reader so much use of  `which'  and  `too'. And he should have spent more time on clarity and less on a cast of thousands.<br />The Dark Materials set is worth reading, but readers shouldn't beat themselves up about any misunderstanding of the inner detail.<br />As for the nephews, I'll be recommending J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and C. J. Cherryh's The Paladin and The Goblin Mirror.
B00005V9L1|5.0|I rented Donnie Darko because it looked like a colorful horror movie. Evil bunny rabbits + a pyscho axe weilding kid= a slasher film with a twist. What I got instead was mindblowing.While this film is very difficult to describe, you really have to see it to enjoy it.This film captivated me from start to finish and made me pray for a sequel. I did watch this movie again, because this movie is a \\"make you think\\" movie, but you can even enjoy it without completely grasping the meaning. Everything about this film is exciting and well placed.If I had a Top Ten Movies of the last decade list Donnie Darko would defenitly make it.Please give me more Darko.
0790734850|5.0|L.A. Confidential is the movie that should have won Best Picture for 1998 over Titanic.  Titanic is good, but this movie is easily superior, with the intelligence and depth to be great not just once, but after repeated viewings.<br />I have watched this movie four times since it first came out and have always been totally wowed over by it.  The depiction of the dark side of 1950s Los Angeles is vivid, the characters are multidimensional, the story complex but not confusing.  <br />Despite the way this movie is marketed, the two principal actors are not Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger, but relative newcomers Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce who have both gone on to do other great films.  (Ironically, Titanic star Leo DiCaprio - the two movies are linked to me- despite his elevated prominence after that movie, has had his career come to almost a dead halt).<br />A way to measure the difference between a good movie and a great movie is what you are thinking after watching it.  Do you think, \\"It was good, but it had this flaw or that flaw\\" or \\"It was good, and I especially liked how it did this or that\\"?  In other words, after viewing it, do you start catching flaws or catching subtleties?  L.A. Confidential fits into this latter category, a movie in which you can always find new and great things, and if you enjoy crime movies at all, this has to be on your viewing list.
B000003TB6|5.0|A must have album for any True hip-hop fan.  This is not their debut album.  &quot;Organix&quot; is the group's first album. If you can find &quot;organix&quot;, buy it, cause it's rare.
0792842723|5.0|This is a fabulous and excellent James Bond film that blasts on to the screen as the first of the 90's Bond films. Excellent \\"teaser\\" with Bond jumping off a cliff to a mission with his fellow agent 006. The facility explodes and enter Tina Turner with her powerful and fabulous song Goldneye. I won't spoil the plot too much for you, but other villians include Xenia Onatop who takes pleasure in her work and strangles men to death with her thighs. (At least they die happy!) The bond girl is Natayla, who helps bond on the computers at the end of the film. I have seen this film 137 times and it deserves a 6 out of a 5.
1577311523|4.0|I've recently read several books by albert ellis, a cognitive psychologist, who has asserted that depression is a result of negative thinking and that its the negative thoughts that need to be attacked and transformed into rational thinking, usually through written exercises. Ellis supports the idea that a healthy self concept is one of no ego; to not identify with your actions as part of you. the reason I mention this is that even though this book is on spiritual undersanding, the parrallels with scientific ideas is remarkable. Science is showing that the wisdom of the centuries has merit.<br />Eckhart's book talks about being the watcher of your thoughts, to not identify with your thoughts. Another important concept, for me, is Eckhart's assertion that suffering comes from living in the past or living in the future. I didn't realize this until I started the process of watching my thoughts and started to see that they all involved future and past events. If you live in the now, you are free from this suffering. <br /> this is a very thought provoking book. I have worked through the eckhart's exercises with some success. Having a skeptical and resistant mind, I found the 'some' success to be remarkable.
B00000G2V4|1.0|I was very disappointed with this Christmas album. <BR>O Holy Night is awe inspiring but the album goes down hill from there. <BR>If you are looking for a traditional Christmas album this is not it.  In my opinion this was put together to showcase Celine's pop music under the auspice of a Holiday album.
0805047905|5.0|As an educator in NYC, I have used this book in my preschool classes.  It is a book with great illustrations, rhyming, and helps to build expectations and predictions amoung young children.  The tune is very catchy and children will recite easily.  It is also a tune that is adopted to teach children other concepts.<br />As a soon to be mom, this book and most of Carle's books are A MUST HAVE.  They are pricey, but well worth it.
B0000009OP|5.0|Truly a great album.  Every song is perfectly crafted and played beautifully.  Played with great intensity.  Meaty and propulsive.  Definitely sets its own mood.  I'd say that this is their best album.
B00005U1YO|3.0|Ever since Exit Planet Dust came out I have been a huge fan of The Chemical Brothers, and Come With Us is another good album, however it lacks something that the Dig Your Own Hole seemed to posess. The album contains some great tunes, particularly It Began In Afrika, Galaxy Bounce and The Test, which is a beautiful song. However it is far less consistant than Dig Your Own Hole, alot of the songs just sound like psychadelic garbage, especially Denmark, Pioneer Skies and My Elastic Eye. I think that the Chemical Brothers have concentrated too much on dazzling their listeners with this one, as a result they have made a very diverse album where every song is different in their own way. If you decide to buy this album you may find that you like some of the tunes, but you certainly won't enjoy all of them, I would recommend this to a fan but to anyone else I would advise to get Dig Your Own Hole if you want the best Chemical Brothers album.

B000002BBY|5.0|Say what you will about the Gallagher brothers: the sibling rivalry, verbal attacks on the members of Blur, and a very short-lived alliance with Robbie Williams.  In the 1990's, Oasis released a near-perfect album of songs so well-constructed, you forgive them for their obvious ripoffs from the Beatles.  Of course, there's the signature hit \\"Wonderwall,\\" but my tune is the gorgeous \\"Don't Look Back in Anger.\\"  Along with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" and Dr. Dre's \\"The Chronic,\\" \\"What's the Story\\" is a 1990's album that will soon be remembered as a classic.  And \\"classic\\" is a term I rarely use.
0345350499|5.0|I am quite a Camelot fanatic and loved this book.  In all of the versions of the Arthurian legend that I have read, Guinevere has been portrayed as a strong, self-assured woman who is as diplomatic as Arthur; Morgaine has been portrayed as the King's harlot sister, an evil witch.  The Gwenhwyfar in The Mists of Avalon, to me, seems a lot more realistic.  She is pious and quiet, always wishing to do right by her God and husband.  As much as I am a feminist, this was unfortunatly more typical of women in that era.  As for Morgaine, I found her quite lovable and find myself understanding how some judgements about her might have been formed.  This is an excellent book.  It seems like a much more realistic version of the Camelot story and I find myself both loving and hating each of the characters.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves the Arthurian story.  This is that and so much more.
B00005LOUP|4.0|Master storyteller Ron Howard (Apollo 13, Ransom, A Beautiful Mind) has brought the classic Dr Seuss story of the nasty Grinch to the screen, and it's great!<br />Jim Carrey is the reason you have to see this film. Combining comedy and pathos, Carrey is the Grinch, albeit under a ton of Rick Baker's makeup. Also Howard's wonderful visionary look to the film is great, narration from Sir Anthony Hopkins and a supporting cast including Jeffrey Tambor and Bill Irwin.<br />There are problems though. The film does tend to slip into schmaltzy sentimentality, and the adult humour doesn't sit very well with the cutesy look of Whoville. Regardless, it's good family fun, and a great DVD to boot. No doubt the Grinch will be grumbling into homes everywhere.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Remember when you first popped in that &quot;Summerteeth&quot; album, thinking that you'd hear tunes that resembled songs from 'Being There', and then sitting back in shock from the departure Wilco made from such tunes as &quot;Misunderstood&quot; and &quot;Sunken Treasure&quot;.   However, if you had the same experience as myself, you were strangely drawn to the new sound and soon Summerteeth became your most played Wilco album... <br />Dude, get ready to rip Summerteeth out of your car radio to replace it with Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. This disc is the real deal my friend.  Wilco once again took a risky departure from their familiar sounds to create what could be, in my own humble [and twisted] opinion, the band's &quot;White Album&quot;. <br />Sure I'm a huge fan, sure I hope this disc does well so Tweedy and The Gang can give their old record label the middle one, however, this disc will only prove that all bands should release what they believe in and what they believe their fans will believe in.<br />Just trust me on this one, buy it now, you'll love it.
B00004STDN|4.0|Renny Harlin's action flick Cliffhanger is an exciting adrenalin-pumping ride. And while it could be described as \\"Die Hard on a Mountain\\", it's still exhilarating fun that's one of Stallone's best films.<br />John Lithgow is the movie's main villain, and he works his stuff to great effect, and set up against Stallone's he-man heroics, the two are both tremendous.  And the action ante is set up far more than other Die Hard rip-offs such as Executive Decision. Renny Harlin's direction makes the film's tendencies toward brutal violence get rather extreme at times, and to see Stallone manage to beat the meatloaf out of the bad guys after getting wasted is sometimes beyond believable, but as the DVD's deleted scenes show, they actually toned down the film's superman-like qualities to good effect.<br />Action aside, the plot is silly at times and some of the characters are taken straight from the big book of bad movie stereotypes. But Stallone's devotees don't care, as this film can be seen now as nostalgic after seeing the big guy's recent flop movies (Get Carter). And Harlin, from Die Hard 2 fame, brings much of the same cool action and stunts, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Action at it's most outrageous (Except maybe for Face Off).
B00005YXZH|5.0|Delighted to see YHF as Amazon's number 1 album on the first day of its official release, since everyone who likes Wilco has had the album for months via download.  There is certainly a lesson there for the RIAA.  And if you have the download and haven't bought the album...do the right thing and buy it now.  An album this good deserves much reward.  It was the best album of 2001, AND it is the best album of 2002. Fantastic from the first note to the last.  \\"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart\\" is one of the great opening cuts ever to be put on record with its lyric weaving back and forth between insanity and despair and ultimately to cruelty.  It may not be radio-friendly, but it's fabulous!  The downloaded album could not be unseated from my CD-changer for 6 months until now that the real thing can take its place. YHF beat the longest prior run, \\"OK Computer.\\"  YHF is great.  Buy it!
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix will go down in film history books as \\"The film that changed cinema forever\\". True, films have done that before: (Jaws, Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction et al) but the Matrix is different in that not only did it change audience's expectations of action cinema but also impacted on countless movies to date.<br />The film itself is the epitome of cool that stands out from the slew of unimaginative science fiction that Hollywood reels out, and with Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss making an unlikely duo in a post-apocalyptic world ruled by artificially intelligent machines, the film finds itself worlds away from admittedly second-rate sci fi cinema.<br />You could argue, as some critics did, that the film's plot is simply an excuse to hang cool effects on, but the premise slowly shapes into such an intricate plot, where machines have taken over the world (a popular idea for sci fi films, with this having similarities to Terminator 2) and then the small amount of snotty critics are silenced. What the Wachowski brothers have done is so imaginative that no film has ever come close to its intricacies and futuristic ideas. Add hints and nudges from Vertigo, classic Western films and Kung-fu karate films into the story and the amazing journey is made even more fascinating and involving.   <br />The visuals incorporated throughout the story are absolutely amazing; with the \\"flow-mo\\" being the coolest visual effect those effects boffins have done since that water tentacle flowed through air in The Abyss. Imitated to death, the scene where Keanu's character Neo dodges bullets is nonetheless the pinnacle of uber-coolness. With thought provoking, mind-bending lines like: \\"It's the smell, if there is such a thing\\"; the film's script is peppered with fascinating lines concerning the very nature of \\"what is real?\\"  Hence the clever advertising campaign for the movie's release: \\"Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself\\". <br />The Matrix has indeed changed cinema. Regardless, it's a great film, loaded to the retinas with out- of- this-world effects, great villians (Agent Smith!), great action set-pieces and awesome stunts from martial arts expert Wu Ping. And with the DVD (awesome stuff, everyone has to own this disc) and upcoming sequel in progress- The Matrix Reloaded, the Matrix is a film that not only has affected filmgoers everywhere, but has also leaked into the fan boy culture of the movie world. To quote Neo: \\"Whoa\\".
0345363132|5.0|Like many 30-something people, I encountered Richard III via a college class on Shakespearean literature.  I also discovered Sharon Kay Penman's novels, but didn't read &quot;The Sunne In Splendour&quot; until 1995.<br />&quot;The Sunne In Splendour&quot; tells of the War of the Roses, the dynastic struggle between the Lancaster and York branches of the Plantagenet family for the throne of England.  It is the story of Richard Plantagenet, Duke of Gloucester, who became Richard III, was overthrown by Henry Tudor, and subsequently slandered so viciously that it took hundreds of years for scholars to even consider he might have been a better man than history portrayed him to be.  Penman's novel follows Richard from childhood to grave, a life with so few joys and so many sorrows that it seems a mercy that Richard died in his early 30s.<br />No monster--portraits show him to be a rather handsome, if tight-featured man--Richard was also no saint; Penman's tale shows his self-righteousness, his acerbic tongue, his blind loyalty to his brother Edward, the King who was known as &quot;the Sunne in Splendour&quot; not only for his incredible looks and charisma, but for the battle that won him his crown at 19.  Penman uses multiple points of view, necessary in this story, to tell Richard's tale.  Her characters are, for the most part, vivid and interesting, and even her flat characters evoke some response in the reader.  Although Penman's book is lengthy (a real doorstopper of a novel), her prose enchants; the dialogue never rings false, her characters never put a foot wrong (unless they're supposed to), and the pace unrolls like a grand tapestry, full of color, light and shadows.<br />Penman's style is poetic, but she's fond of long paragraphs that nearly topple chapters beneath their weight.  This was the first of her Plantagenet novels, and it shows when compared to &quot;Falls The Shadow&quot; or &quot;The Reckoning.&quot;  It could have used a little more editing, some tightening, a little breaking up of those hefty paragraphs to speed up the pace.  Not that the story slips away the moment you close the book; Penman's skill is such that you may find yourself recalling scenes in vivid detail weeks, even months later.<br />If your knowledge of Richard III comes from Shakespeare, or even the most recent movie with Ian McKellen, do yourself a favor and read an opposing viewpoint.  Whichever version of Richard you prefer, you will come away with an enduring love of this book.htening, a little breaking up of those hefty paragraphs to speed up the pace.

B00005U16N|5.0|this is a great movie everyone should see it
6305537798|5.0|My reasons for why I love this movie. In no particular order.<br />1) It is a teen movie but NOT a teen movie<BR>2) The way Shakespeare is thrown in every so often so that it connects to the original writer of the play. Patrick Verona (where most of Will's plays are set), the school is a character. Mandala's hapless and hopeless obsession with him 'we are one'as she puts it<BR>3) I am not a feminist, but Kat played one kick[ing]girl for her time.<BR>4) How well the movie was adapted by Gil Junger from the play. Original plot and even lines! were in the movie<BR>5) Incredible likeable actors. Both estetically pleasing, Heath and Julia are great actors. Considering it was Heath's first role, he stood out incredible.<BR>6) The 'witty repartee' of the movie. How could anyone not like the line \\"Am I that transparent? I need you, I want you, oh baby, oh baby\\". <BR>7) The smooth dialogue throughout the movie. Very quick responses from each character<BR>8) The secondary characters never lacked screen time and were not made to look like supporting characters<BR>9) How well the actors cemented their roles to how good old William protrayed the characters way back when. Really, you would think it was Shakespearen actors trying to invent 'our days'<BR>10) The moral issues it comes out with. The pregnancy suit that Bianca has to wear. No smoking, no drinking (except when Kat shows her 'stunning digestive pyrotechnics'. <br />And in true 10 Things fashion, I had one four more. See number 12 to understand my reasoning. <br />11) Mrs. Perky<BR>12) The end when Julia recites the poem that is obviously written about her love interest, Patrick Verona. The ironic part of it, there are 14 things she mentions she hates, not 10. Count it, you will see that I am right. <BR>13) The music that fit into every scene. From Club Skunk to the prom to when Patricka and Kat play paint ball.<BR>14) How finally, the slimy bad guy who was after Bianca got decked.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I read the book when the third came out.  By then I had already grown a love for the book and went on to read the others.  When I heard that the movie was coming out I reread the book to make sure that I would remember everything that they put into the movie from the book.  When I saw the movie I was a bit unhappy.  Yes the effects were great.  I was very disappointed with the ending though.  Each room is supposed to have a different teacher's trick in it to stop whoever tries to get the stone but many were left out.  Snape's potion room with the accompanying riddle was forgotten as well as the troll.  All of the friends had part in getting Harry to the stone and the mirror.  Hermione was supposed to stay with Harry until the potions room where she takes the potion to go back while Harry takes the potion to go foreward.  Overall it is alright, these portions mentioned are very key to the story and would not have harmed the movie sales if anything it would have made it more popular to the hardcore book lovers like myself.
6305603847|4.0|I didn't know what to expect of the film version of The Wall, all except that it would be disturbing.  But it turned out to be a disturbingly nice film.<br />Sure, the acting is cheesy, but only to a small point.  After all, Tommy was a lot worse!  Nobody ever heard of a perfect record-to-movie adaptation.  Bob Geldof is perfect with mixing the traits of Syd Barrett and Roger Waters into one character, who is obviously known as Pink.  There's also Bob Hoskins playing Pink's manager!<br />The choice of music is a little flawed with Hey You not going into the final cut (no Waters pun intended), Goodbye Blue Sky placed in the wrong order, and Empty Spaces not going into Young Lust, instead opting to put in a new song \\"What Shall We Do Now?\\".  Even then, Young Lust is meant for questionable camera shots, wink wink.  It's hilarious to see how Geldof handles both In The Flesh songs, especially the second one!  It's worth the [money]!<br />Gerald Scarfe had worked with the Floyd earlier on the cartoon that played during Welcome To The Machine when live.  His style of animation, capturing full, detailed drawings and not Disney-like cartoon characters, fits well with this movie.  Every Floyd fan should know the carnal flowers, the praying-mantis wife, the schoolmaster, the ballerina prosecutor, and especially the goose-stepping hammers.  The whole movie could have been Scarfe's and there wouldn't be major flaws.<br />Floyd fans who have heard the Big 4 (DSotM, WYWH, Animals, Wall) should see this.  Those who just made the great decision to get into Floyd should put this one off for a bit.
B00005ASOI|3.0|Strange events are occurring at a German dance school and new American student Jessica Harper suspects they have something to do with the teachers. Dario Argento's proclaimed masterpiece leaves me feeling indifferent. Stylish, atmospheric, with a memorable score by Goblin, but ultimately, there's very little story, which becomes a major hindrance when the bloody murders and the suspenseful build-up to them aren't present. Acting's subpar, too, but it seems a bit frivolous to mention that. Only recommended to horror fans seeking a stylish, but not particularly frightening affair.
B000002VJH|5.0|i wasn't going to write this review since i didn't buy my copy offa amazon, but then i saw some [person] dissin' The Music Never Stopped, and i couldn't control myself. side one of this record is [freakin] beautiful, and Music is the best, though milkin' is close... side two, Blues is good, the other two... nyet.<BR>Man, real good music -the incoherrent justice striker!
B000002LK1|5.0|Violator is, in a word, perfect. Every single song flows from one to the other, and there's not one track that I can call mediocre.<br />World in my eyes: A great introduction to the album; and as one reviewer suggested, it's almost as if Gahan and Gore are telling you what you're going to be listening to for the next 40 minutes, and to get ready for the rest of the album (\\"Let me show you the world in my eyes\\").<br />Sweetest perfection: I'm guessing this song is about drugs (what else could it really be about?), but either way, this is a really ominous and brooding track, more so than almost all the other songs on Violator.<br />Personal jesus: This is probably the song that everyone's heard, and I don't really have any complaint with that. The bluesy rhythm that Gore lays down on his guitar is awesome, and I just want to stomp my feet up and down every time I hear this one.<br />Halo: This isn't one of my favorites, but that doesn't mean it's not good. The chorus is a strong one, if it's any consolation.<br />Waiting for the night: The ultimate night song. Play this one while lying on your bed at midnight with all the lights off. Spooky.<br />Enjoy the silence: Without a doubt my favorite song on Violator. It definitely grows on you (I know it did on me), but after listening to it a few times, you start to appreciate it a lot more, and eventually you'll just be hooked. The guitar riff at the end of the song is utterly captivating, and I wish it would just go on forever and ever.<br />Policy of truth: The perfect song to go after Silence and its interlude, \\"Crucified\\". I like everything about this track, the chorus, the lyrics, (\\"You'll see your problems multiply/if you continually decide/to faithfully pursue/the policy of truth\\") the music, and that's why it's one of my favorites on the album.<br />Blue dress: Sung by Gore, this is another one of the weaker tracks of the album, but like I said about Halo, that doesn't mean it's bad at all.<br />Clean: A great closer. This one is yet again about drugs; Gore wrote this song, but it applies to Gahan just as much. The ending, like Silence's, makes you wish it just kept going on and on.<br />Violator has stayed in my current CD rotation for the past six months or so, and I don't plan to take it out any time soon. Unfortunately, after listening to songs from Music for the Masses, Songs of Faith and Devotion, and Exciter, I think Violator is the only album of Depeche Mode's that I'll ever enjoy; at least, the only album I'll enjoy as much as this one. I do like a couple of songs from Exciter (Dream on, Freelove), but that's about it. But hey, we're all entitled to our own opinions, right?
B00005MAM2|5.0|The strength of this DVD is it's extras. There's an interview with the creator/director that explains his concept of the film. The original production report for the film showing cells being painted, the voice artists, and more. The complete storyboard (4500 stills). An option for showing translations of graffiti during playback. After viewing the film, browse the exras to get an idea of the work that was involved. You won't be disappointed. <br />As for the anime itself, the imagery is top notch, with attention to every small detail. From what I know, the original film was done without computer graphics. If you are a student of art, you will appreciate the effort put into each frame.<br />Once the \\"wow\\" factor had worn off, I attempted to understand the storyline. After several viewings, there are some things that still confuse me. If you buy this and want to understand what's going on, expect to sit through it more than once.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I've heard a number of people criticize this album as simply being a bunch of songs that the band didn't think were good enough for Kid A, but that simply isn't the case.  The songs here just don't fit with the sound of Kid A.  Whereas Kid A was largely darker and slower, Amnesiac is faster paced and poppier (well, for Radiohead, anyway).  Amnesiac plays up the same themes we are used to from Radiohead: existential themes, isolation, frustration and politically laced songs, etc. But the overall feel of the album is much more lively and loose than any other of their albums.  This is right up there with the band's best.
B000002MY3|5.0|This is by far Alanis' best work and always will be. There really is no question why this record sold 14 to 20 million copies, being that from start to finish you get the ultimate music experience. It's a perfect fresh start the public needed after Kurt Cobain's death. Each of the songs are fresh, raw, and catchy, and the lyrics are honest and empathetic. Being a teenage girl, I can relate to and understand each and every lyric much better than I would have been able to five years ago when I received this as Christmas gift in 1996 at 11 and one half years. Oops! I just revealed my age and probally repelled the reader from finishing this. I liked the music, but could only understand some of the words which makes listening to this today two times the charm. Alanis was 21 when she wrote and recorded this, and though she was speaking of her own angst and pains, I'm sure she intended to reach out to other people in her age group including me. The music alone is great and the entire album is one large highlight. Here's a brief summary list of the songs and I how I interpereted and connected to the lyrics:<BR>1) \\"All I Really Want\\" A request for an escape from stress and to take happiness in the things that really matter.<BR>2) \\"You Oughta Know\\" Well, this is her first single, and I'm pretty sure we all know what this song is about. I'm avoiding dating but I can relate to similar situations with any jerk.<BR>3) \\"Perfect\\" This song is basically about being pressured to satisfy everyone around you and not being accepted. Alanis specifically wrote it about parental pressure and her anorexia.<BR>4) \\"Hand In My Pocket\\" This is a great catchy song, and I'm pretty sure it's about not having to be all or nothing: you can be satisfied in the middle and enjoy a variety, you get what I'm saying?<BR>5) \\"Right Through You\\" Yeah! Couldn't have said it better myself! Listen to the song and you'll know what I mean.<BR>6) \\"Forgiven\\" I'm not quite sure, but this song might be about religious pressure?<BR>7) \\"You Learn\\" This song is about learning from your experiences and don't be afraid to experiment with life.<BR>8) \\"Head Over Feet\\" This is basically just a love/friendship song. The music is better than the words.<BR>9) \\"Mary Jane\\" This is an ode to a lost and confused grieving friend.<BR>10)\\"Ironic\\" This many peoples' favorites and hence the title it's about irony in life.<BR>11)\\"Not The Doctor\\" This is one of those songs I can relate to more than anything, it's about being fed up with having to be responsible for someone 24/7.<BR>12)\\"Wake Up\\" This song is a message to people who are so dissatisfied with life, but don't do anything to improve.<BR>13) \\"You Oughta Know\\" (reprise)<BR>14) \\"Your House\\" An accapella. Boring.<BR>I know a lot of people who own this album, and I don't hear any complaints.
B00000269G|5.0|I met Mr. Garner in the early sixties at the Seattle Worlds Fair.  When I shook his hand, I noticed that he had the webs between his fingers removed allowing a greater reach.  This was the only unatural thing about the man (who played a Stinway instead of his trademark Baldwin).  Clearly there was something &quot;autistic&quot; or &quot;savant&quot; about this man whose mind and body seemed to be exclusively constructed to create music and little else.<BR>There is no standard for Erroll even to this day.  Whatever you think of Jazz (I'm not a great fan of the genre) you have to acknowledge his brilliance.  If you were to overlay classical pieces - rythems, patterns of harmonies, his music would prevail (without someone else's music or arangement other than the simple melody which he ofter enhanced over the composer:  At a concert in Portland, Mr. Garner played the third movement of Gershwin's &quot;Concerto in F&quot; - he WAS the orchestra).  <BR>Listen to Garner.  At some monent of time, even for a few seconds, you'll be thrilled.  Thanks Tony.
B00004W50T|5.0|This debut from Bob Dylan's former backing band is masterful and brilliant for everything it's not; overlong, drug-addled, pretentious or silly. When it first came out in '68 it instantly flew in the face of everything that was happening in rock music (long drum solos, earsplitting guitars and overwrought lead singers) and offered a laid back, simple formula that still sounds fresh today. While the lyrics themselves perfectly encapsulate the tone of the era (Dylan's ballad \\"Tears Of Rage\\") the delivery is what sets them apart. The sole hit from this album \\"The Weight\\" is one of the all time greatest rock/pop songs and serves as a hefty reminder that even with their quiet, somewhat ragged delivery, The Band were a force to be reckoned with, even from the very beginning. A True Classic.
0452282152|3.0|I read this book after several friends recommended it to me. Like several other reviewers I found it to be a pleasant read, but not an outstanding one. There are many positives to this book. It is well written and extremely informative as to the life and times of Vermeer as well as to the painter's craft. My main complaints would be fact that I really did not feel like I know much more about any of the characters at the end of the book than I did at the beginning. Its an informative book, and well worth the read, but it would not rank on the list of the best books I have read so far this year.
0792156684|1.0|My son (aged 14) and I went to see the special effects on the big screen, as he had been a fan of the actual historical event since early childhood. I asked him afterwards if he would like eventually to own a tape of the movie for our &quot;Titanic&quot; collection. &quot;Are you kidding?&quot; he said, &quot;This movie isn't about the 'Titanic'.&quot;  And so it isn't. It's about a couple of 90's kids (and I mean 1990's, not 1890's) in a cinematic playground that reminds us vaguely of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster. (That anybody should complain of the predictability of the ending is a sure sign that this film has suckered us into a wrong purpose for our tale. A film about the sinking is about what it was like to be there on that ghastly night, not about &quot;whether or not it's going to sink.&quot;)<br />&quot;A Night to Remember&quot; remains hands-down the best film about the disaster. (If you really must have soap opera added, there's always the 1953 &quot;Titanic&quot; with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck.) <br />For all the money spent on this production, it has practically no sense of time and place (of the sort delivered by a film such as &quot;Black Robe&quot; or &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, or even , God help us, &quot;Gladiator&quot;), as the writing of dialogue in a thoroughly modern idiom - with acting style to match, except for Billy Zane - completely torpedoes any such sense. <br />This film is about taking money out of the pockets of goofy teenagers or out of the pockets of those who artistic life is indistiguishable from that of goofy teenagers. It is a profoundly cynical and dishonest piece of work.<br />The so-called &quot;Academy&quot; lost all credibility with me that year, picking this piece of tinsel over &quot;The Full Monty&quot;, a film with real cinematic craft about real people in a real place and time.
B00005RFAI|4.0|This is a good, solid album.  Great tracks including Don't Let Me Get Me seem to be telling the listener quite a bit about Pink's life.  The writing feels very personal, as though this album was a catharsis for Pink.  Listeners will enjoy the great &quot;girl power&quot; songs and will be able to relate to her honesty.
B00003CWNR|5.0|Sometimes your life is hard but is the life you have and you have to live it.<br />Not all the people get to develop this kind of commitment required to solve hard life problems to another people that are not their family in law but are their family in your heard.<br />Sometimes people who has not education or life options can not see the way to live being happy, but sometimes appears somebody who made this happend as this DOCTOR....without a formal degree but who deserve to be call DOCTOR always in capital letters.
B00005QXDD|5.0|this is the first time I actually felt bad that I downloaded a cd as mp3... I had to purchase this so I felt better and could sleep... there will be no buyer's remorse over this one... enjoy.
B00003CY6M|3.0|I was disappointed in this film because I expected a lot of fizz with Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack, both favorites of mine.  The plot has already been characterized as pretty farfetched and a bit [stupid], but if you can get by the basic premise that two people so strongly attracted to each other would go through so much foolishness solely to put obstacles in their way, then you may enjoy watching this film.  The chemistry between Beckinsale and Cusack is there but because so much of the time is spent with them just missing each other, it really doesn't get off the ground as it should.  However, the movie has its moments (some of them provided by Cusack real-life best friend Jeremy Piven) and overall is a relatively pleasant way to kill a couple of hours.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is up there with Memento as one of the top films of last year. The 80's references were great. There were the obvious ones like the Smurfs and the not so obvious, like how at the end, on their bikes, the kids look just like the kids in ET. The music was amazing and haunting. The ambiguity of the ending was a big risk, but I think it paid off. This is one you need to watch over and over again to analyze and think about. The DVD extras shed some more light on the storyline and the music video is a nice bonus. It's impossible to read the book in the extras on a 19&quot; screen, but luckily you can get it on the official website. The book puts a whole new twist on the movie.
6300213501|3.0|This episode has good action, but some of the plot and dialogue is pretty cheesy. You can probably afford to skip this one unless you are a Kirk fan.
0393312836|5.0|For the most part, there is wildly violent entertainment and then there is remarkably provocative art and seldom do the two overlap. One of those rare occasions is Anthony Burgress 1962 transgressive classic, A Clockwork Orange. At first, the tale of Alex, a malicious, young degenerate of the future, seems like a warped, little shocker, full of madcap language, malevolent intentions and stomach-turning violence. As the novel progresses, though, it is soon evident that Mr. Burgess is carefully surveying an important subject matter: juvenile delinquency. Through portrayals of Alexs parents, he comments on Dr. Spock-style principles. Through portrayals of the government and prison system, he comments on what type of society produces these baby-faced killers (One as amoral and creative as the delinquents themselves). And through the main characters vivid naration he explores the surprisingly human thoughts and motives behind this appalling behavior. Most often when one walks into a theater, turns on the TV or opens a novel and squeems, the said medias creators are attempting to vend cheap thrills. But not always. Mr. Burgess brilliant and alarming book and the stunning Stanley Kubrick film based upon it are instances when true artists looked the seedier side of human nature in the face and produced poignant works of art from their observations.
0671045725|5.0|Mark Bowden did a great job with this, the movie doesnt even compare to the true to life book. This book should live a long life with the rest of the war novels.Hearing the bravery, the heroism and the gore of the catastrophe that happened on that day.The movie doesnt even scratch the surface of how bad it went wrong. I have two words for the prospective buyer BUY IT you will never put it down.
B00000K2VZ|4.0|They don't make `em like Janis Joplin anymore. In today's age of gratuitous vocal overdubbing and endless studio-sparkle, very rarely do vocalists feel the need to muster the immense oomph that was evident in almost every note Miss Joplin ever recorded. Sure, her voice was rugged, raspy and not at all pretty in the traditional sense, but she bellowed every word from straight from the bottom of her gut, putting fiery emotion into every syllable. The album that displays her vocals at their most confident is 1971's Pearl. On her debut, 1968's Cheap Thrills, sludgy, psychedelic guitar shared an equal footing with her mighty cries. On 1969's Kozmic Blues, dense, funky baselines were her partner. On Pearl, though, the instrumentation is placed distinctly behind her vocals. Her commanding, three-dimensional, highly textured voice bounces across delightful melodies (\\"Move Over\\" \\"Cry Baby\\"), induces dulcet psychedelic trances (\\"Half Moon,\\" \\"Trust Me\\") and soars straight to the heavens (\\"Get It While You Can,\\" \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\"). On a few tracks, her new confidence results in unstructured yelping (\\"A Woman Left Lonely,\\" \\"My Baby\\"), but that is forgivable for so many moments that are utterly intoxicating. No vocalist in years has released an album as raw and powerful as Pearl and it is becoming increasingly unlikely that one ever will.
B000002BQK|5.0|MARIAH'S BEST ALBUM YET!! NICE MIX OF SLOW BALLAD & UPBEAT NUMBERS MAKE THIS A GREAT & EMOTIONAL ALBUM. THE MUSIC IS ALSO VERY GOOD TOO. IF YOU LIKED THE SONGS \\"HONEY\\" \\"BUTTERFLY\\" AND \\"MY ALL\\" THEN YOU'LL LOVE THE REST.  MY FAV SONG IS \\"CLOSE MY EYES\\" WHICH IS A GREAT SLOW NUMBER.  IF YOU LIKE POP & SOFT R&B THEN PICK UP \\"BUTTERFLY\\"... IT'S OFF THE HOOK!!
078062999X|1.0|This ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of \\"Hamlet\\" to ever reach the screen. Branagh's approach to the material can only be described as vulgar; going to such lengths as depicting Ophelia in a straightjacket, having Fortinbras' army appear suddenly on the horizon (looking very much like the climax of \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\") when the palace is apparently guarded only by Francisco (who shouts the very un-Shakespearean cry of \\"ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack\\" before being gunned down), and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of Jimmy Cagney's Bottom and Mary Pickford's Kate.<br />Branagh chose to set his film in an Edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text, so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in Elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed. And Branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties of the ambiguous nature of Hamlet and Olphelia's relationship, treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window.<br />The uncut text does allow Branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime: more footage of Kenneth Branagh. This is never so apparent as in the \\"How All Occasions Inform Against Me\\" speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film (at least that's how it feels), which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of Gone With The Wind's \\"I'll never be hungry again.\\" This may serve Branagh's ego, but it does not serve Shakespeare or the speech: when I saw the film in the theater, I leaned over to my companion and snickered \\"Great Moments With Mr. Hamlet.\\"<br />Branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last, when he attempts to out-do the Olivier film and it's justly celebrated death of Claudius by having Hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch, impaling him with a sword. Branaugh's Dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through Claudius' heart with a super hero's bulls eye. The only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off-the-wall funnyy. <br />While this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy, it is in fact nothing but a star-studded display of a once-talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism. The Emperor has no clothes, and this Hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man's ego out of control.
B0000028M7|5.0|I'm sure most of you know that Layne Staley was recently found dead in his Seattle home at the age of 34.  While his passing is a huge loss to the music world, his voice will live on in the amazing body of work Alice In Chains released.<br />All of their albums &amp; ep's are great, but &quot;Dirt&quot; is probably their definitive album.  It runs the gammut of bone-crushing tunes like &quot;Them Bones&quot; and &quot;Angry Chair&quot; to songs like &quot;Down in a Hole&quot;, which displays Layne Staley's and Jerry Cantrell's great vocal harmonies.  <br />Every song on this album leaves you wanting to hear everything by this band.  And I suggest that you pick up ALL of their releases.  Everything they ever put out is amazing!
079073639X|4.0|I liked the movie \\"Sphere\\" which was based on the wonderful novel by Mr. Michael Crichton. It is about a group of scientists who go underwater to study a spaceship that 'crashed' there. Inside the ship they find an odd sphere. Weird stuff then starts to happen.<br />This movie could of been a lot better. They make the story kind of cheesy. Except it is a very good story on how people's minds work. The start of the movie starts out great but the movie makers screwed up the last 20 minutes. They also turned a great ending into a mediocre one that is just plain stupid.<br />My suggestion is to read the great book first and then watch the movie. If you don't have time to read the book then watch the movie. \\"Sphere\\" is too good a thing to pass up. I give the movie four stars.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Well, everyone here must know by now what the film is about, so I'm not even gonna go into the plot. The film was directed by James Cameron (Terminator 1 & 2, Aliens) and was a commercial hit upon it's release in December 1997. When you see the film, you can see why. It has all the makings of a major blockbuster: passion, romance, action, suspense, and big budget special effects...the effects do not seem to over take the film. Instead, the movie contains some of the best scenes ever on film. My favorites being the \\"flying\\" scene, and the final shots of the Titanic before it sinks into the sea. <br />The acting in the film is above average. Leonardo Dicaprio is so-so as Jack Dawson the steerage passenger who sweeps first class passenger Rose Dewitt Bukator (Kate Winslet) off her feet. Kate Winslet is excellent as Rose. She is 100% believable as the rich girl who finally finds true love. She is able to draw inner emotion that in the hands of any other actress, would go unnoticed. Billy Zane as Rose's fiancee Cal also gives a great performance. He is able to convey evil at times in the film, but deep inside, you feel that he actually does love Rose, he just doesn't know how to show it. <br />The direction of the film is excellent. Parts of the screenplay leave a little something to be desired, but overall the screenplay is good. The best shot scenes in the film of course involve the Titanic. Instead of just getting standard shots of the ship, the camera sweeps around the entire ship. The music used in the film is extraordinary. It sets the tone for scenes of romance, passion and for scenes of danger. At times the score can be quite haunting. <br />Many have criticized the film for being overlong, boring and just plain bad. People who say these things just don't seem to understand the passion behind making an epic film such as this. And no, I didn't find the nudity distasteful. I think this is a film men & women can both like. The women can drool over Dicaprio, and theyget a love story. But, the men can drool over Winslet, and they get an action film. Titanic is a great film. It would go up on my list along with Gone With The Wind as one of the greatest movies of all time. <br />Overall Grade: A+ (10++++)
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This is a good compilation. I for one hate compilations because they take parts of different pieces of art to make a bad collage. \\"No. 1's\\" is good for the fans that like the Beatles hits and don't really like the rest of their songs. For the die hard fans this would be good for the car or cleaning music, but not as an enjoyable relaxation tool. For that I would suggest real albums, mainly the later work they did. This is still a great addition to any music library. It is also a great introduction tool to introduce young people to the greatest rock n' roll band of all time. I give \\"No. 1's\\" four stars because nothing beats a real album.
0385503954|5.0|On several different levels, &quot;Atonement&quot; is a beautiful, memorable, and thoroughly engrossing novel.  All of us who enjoy serious fiction know at some level that plot and characters are the author's creation, the result of a series of deliberate choices.  Here, though, Ian McEwan makes that reality a key element in the novel itself.  The miracle is that, for me at least, this self-conscious dimension in no way interfered with my being totally engaged by the story he tells.  But it would make for fantastic book-club discussion!!
B000063V8R|5.0|I know that the series is excellent on tape anyway, and i just know that the sound affects and picture quality are going to be excellant. My husband is a very serious star trek fan and has series 3 on tape. But he is now trying to collect then on dvd,as and when we have the money.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This supernatural-thriller-sci-fi film is made even better due to wonderful cinematography and a breathtaking soundtrack. With a very dark American Beauty feel for pacing and convincing performances from sympathetic characters this film didn't make nearly enough of a splash for its major release. Hopefully, it will find its more deserved recognition as a sleeper cult film.<br />The subject matter of the decay of middle america, the concepts of mental illness, the stigma of life in parichial towns and the layers effects of time travel and fate carry a beautiful love story and themes of metaphysical growth and triumph. <br />I can't give this film enough praise. There isn't a bad element. Visually appealing, cerebrally stimulating, emotionally moving, well performed and scripted. Watch it. You'll thank yourself.
B000001FS3|5.0|Simply the greatest album of all time, nothing compares to this master piece from the energetic, revalating guitar chords on Where the streets have no name, to the emotional cry of bono voice in Mothers of the dissappered. There's no ablum that fits togethers and seizes the energy and love of the heart, and the profound purity of the soul. The album has everything a u2 or any true music fan could hope for, simply great, just like U2!
0671024256|5.0|I cannot express enough gratitude to Stephen King for writing this book. It was the first Stephen King book I ever read, and it motivated me to start taking myself seriously as a writer, rather than just a hobby-ist. It's not just fluff either. A lot of King's words echo in the back of my mind as sound advice for getting your point across effectively as I'm typing on the keyboard.
B000002ITK|3.0|Of course the greatest hits has \\"I Wanna Rock\\" and \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\", the two most popular songs. But how could they ignore \\"Burn In Hell\\" which was featured in the movie Pee Wee's Big Adventure? You can't ignore the \\"pop rock\\" songs no matter how bubble gum they may sound to hard rock fans.
1558216847|5.0|It's a great read, a truly inspirational book.  But,there seems to be some doubt whether or not the book is true.  May I suggest one compares this narrative to the memoirs of those who retreated from Moscow with Napoleon, an extremely well documented fact. Clearly the tone is the same between the the 1812 narratives and the Long Walk:  matter of fact recolections of horror and sorrow.  Then there are the practical details of survival,from the making of shoes to the scrounging of food.  These also match up well with the Napoleonic memoires.  Both grant that luck played a major part, and the comparisons can go on and on.  And lastly the failure to seem totaly accurate to the reader.  As every story teller knows: it gets a little better every time you tell it.  Then there is the fact that years, pain, and grief all affect memory.  Lastly there is the fact that by their very success these writers are capable of super human efforts.  If they weren't these books never would have been written.
B0000636UN|3.0|Sheryl's not my favorite artist in the whole world, but I respect her for always raising the stakes with each album.  She's not like a lot of artists where every album sounds just like the 5 before it.  So when Sheryl finally made an album where she just kinda coasted along and relaxed on her current plateau, I was disappointed, but she's due.  C'mon, C'mon is like a soundtrack for sitting on a porch in the country with a pitcher of lemonade and an old hound dog.<BR>That said, I have never felt as neutral about an album as I do this one.  This is my new barometer for measuring other albums.  There was a song I really liked (&quot;Soak Up The Sun&quot;) and one I didn't like at all (&quot;It's So Easy&quot; with Don Henley).  Aside from that, I had no feeling one way or the other about these songs.  It seemed as though very little effort was put into it.  I'm sure that it will spawn 3 singles which will play all over every &quot;The New Lite Mix FM&quot; station for the next few years.  Thankfully, I won't be listening.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Yet another nearly perfect record for Wilco.  The label that dropped the ball on this record really lost out, it's an amazing accomplishment!
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is Slayers best and fastest album.  All of the songs are all thrash metal should be expected to be.  I was reading some reviews about god hates us all as getting back to their roots and the next reign in blood. it doesnt even come close.  The new stuff isn't even real thrash, they've lost the style they made.  If you get a slayer album, buy this one. SO FAST!!
B000002MG1|5.0|I never quite understood the power of music until Everybody Hurts came on the radio and I realized the idiosy of my depression.  This album is full of quiet power. It has songs about death, love, sex, redemption and rock and roll that strike the soul with a quiet reverence. Every song is an REM classic. Man on the Moon is a song about Andy Kaufman, as much as it is about a man's redemption. Drive's famous lyrics (Hey kids rock and roll, nobody tells you what to do) is as much as a plea for understanding theb a plea of defiance. And then there is Nightswimming, the sexiest most beautiful song of REM's carrer of not the sexiest song of the entire decade. Automatic For the People is the most quietly loud album ever full of shimmering strings and and guitars where you can hear every pluck. The powerful vocals of Michael Stipe give hefty poetry to this glorious sound. The name of this album comes from a soul-food restaurant's slogan, but it fits perfectly well here too.
B00005YXZH|5.0|'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' has a Big Star 'Sister Lovers' feel to it.  This album sounds like it could fall apart at any moment, but love (barely) holds the pieces together.  the lyrics are thoughtful and genuine.  it's a really good record.  If you're a Wilco fan, you should also check out Outrageous Cherry, their newest album 'Book of Spectral Projections' is worthy of a listen, and it might just appeal to you.
B00005V9HA|5.0|What more could you want in a horror film? This one has it all, zombies, interesting characters, plot twists, awesome sets (the morgue/hospital and the basement especially), great action scenes, and lots of gore including brain removal, eyeball burst-yuck, gut spillage, bone saw through a corpse, decapitation, etc. This is such a classic, a must see! Right up there with Return of the Living Dead, the Beyond, and Dead Alive (which was inspired by this film). A really awesome ending too, this might just be the second best horror film ever after the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
1577311523|5.0|When I first came across this title at the bookstore, I was interested, but it seemed to promise  quite a bit, and having read enough books that promise and don't deliver, I decided to wait.  While at the library, I found the unabridged audio version of \\"The Power of Now\\" and decided to check it out.  I found myself immediately drawn into Tolle's story as he spoke with a calm energy and certainty that I am sure comes from true enlightenment.  I was so impressed that I bought the unabridged audio myself, just to be sure and grasp the meaning as he intended.  His teachings seem to have a clarity that few others can rival.  <br />This moment is all that we ever have, but that doesn't mean that we are ignorant or oblivious to our past or future (as a previous review seemed to believe that Tolle advocates).  We choose our thoughts on a constant basis:  it is all that we ever have a certain control over.  We can all choose to be IN-JOY-IN-MYSELF, at each and every moment, as Tolle states.<br />As for you, I cannot say if this book is right NOW.  I believe that if you feel that you are led to read this book, then by all means do.  I loaned my copy to someone who thought it was \\"too advanced\\" and couldn't grasp much of the material, and I have spoke with others who feel as I do about the book.  As I said earlier, I thought that he speaks rather clearly and eloquently on the practice of being present.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I'm sure I'm not saying anything new, seeing as this album has been getting good reviews since Reprise dropped Wilco last year.  But allow me to say it, this album is incredible, awesome, a landmark, a gift from god, and many many more things.  Thats all, if you buy one cd in the next year, please make it this one!  Thank you Jeff Tweedy and Co. for making this album.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is simply a great album that gets better with every listen.  Ignore all the reviews trying to compare Yankee Hotel Foxtrot to anything else.  Just turn it up and enjoy.  You have to love the fact that Wilco's record label wanted nothing to do with this masterpiece and sent the band packing.  The contiuning evolution of Jeff Tweedy from Uncle Tupelo to early Wilco to YHF has been a great ride.  I can't imagine them ever topping this album, but I've said that about Tweedy before!
0553801481|5.0|The most interesting book i've read in years.  I am looking forward for next book.
0452281881|5.0|This guy *must* have worked at Ogilvy before... its just to close to home!!  Hilarious read for anyone in the ad/marketing/PR world!
B00005UKE0|5.0|Thank you, George, for putting out this remastered set.  I used to have it on lp, and I hesitated to pick it up on CD (I always thought it would make an excellent single disc album...I could live without the jams that made up sides 5 and 6 of the original 3 record album).  But following George's passing last year, I just had to pick this set up.  <br />What a great album!  What a great bunch of tracks!  Sure, there are a few weaker numbers, but there are so many wonderful tunes.  My favorites are: I'd Have You Anytime (a sweet, mellow ballad written with Bob Dylan), My Sweet Lord, and Awaiting On You All (I love to turn this one up...it really rocks!).  This new set includes all the tracks from the original, plus a bonus track from the original sessions, and a remake of the hit My Sweet Lord recorded with his son Dhani.  There's a nice booklet with some brief notes by George, and the artwork has been updated too.  Buy your copy from Amazon today!<br />George had long been overshadowed by John and Paul during the Beatle years, but this album proved that he was a standout talent in his own right.  I hope that the rest of George's catalog gets remastered and released with bonus and rare tracks, and eventually maybe a new one-disc compilation of the best of his solo work.
B00005QY5Y|3.0|After all the press he got since leaving Whiskeytown, I really looked forwrad to the album.  It's okay -- some really nice songs, and probably worth buying.  But I have to admit I don't listen to it too much ... it just sort of meanders at times.  And the first track (New York) starts out really catchy and then breaks into a really annoying Bruce Springsteen sax bit that I wish I could cut off.  Overall okay.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this cd! I listen to it 3-4 times a day! It's beautiful and reminds me of classic music that never fades.
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch's Mulholland Drive is one of the most orignel films I have seen in a long time. Its also I film I think David Lynch does not want us to stress on but we do anyway. Just watch the film and don't think so hard. Mulholland drive does not follow a single plot the film goes in and out of dreams sometimes it gets so counfusing that you don't no when there in dreams and when ther not. But thats the whole point of the film. If you watch close enough you will firgure out enough to where you like it. Its a brillient film its by far the best David Lynch film he hit new ground with this one. Remember DON'T THINK TO HARD.
B0000039LE|5.0|You should all know the plot of this movie by now. So I won't go there. But if you seen the other Halloween sequels as well then you'd know tht the original is the best because none of the other sequels run close to what the original provided. The orginal was the best feature ever because Micheal's work was the bes tin this origianl film. If you think that one of the other Halloween movies were better than the original then you must be crazy because the orignal is the best. It has the best music, the best features, the best killings and the list goes on forever. So if you haven't seen the orginal Halloween then rent it tonight because this the best Halloween today. It's probably even better then Halloween Resurrection which hits theaters on July 19th. So if you haven't seen Halloween see it tonight. Because if you don't then Micheal will get you and slaughter you. Like he slaughtered Haddonfield to pieces.
B00003CXC6|4.0|This movie is truly great, but it seems to lose a bit of its power on the small screen.  Makes me long for the old days at the Thalia theater in Manhattan, when they'd have revivals of gems like this.  (sigh)
0345349571|4.0|My history tutor at University snapped at me when I mentioned Barbara Tuchman. She was not 'an historian'. This book is a superb read from beginning to end and delights in telling a wonderful story of a very violent era. I am not sure that Tuchman actually proves her case that the 14th century was a distant mirror, but it is a fine piece of historical writing in any case. Even though Tuchman focuses on one slightly obsure nobleman, she manages to sweep across the history of the time and place with a relentless curiousity and drive.<br />I disagree with my tutor and I believe this is a fine book with some of the best historical prose in the English language.<br />As for the mirror, well it is a great title and gets you thinking, but I cannot see the link apart from the violence, which seemed to be present in every century.
0743216458|4.0|I've read a lot of Ambrose, but for some reason I never picked up Band of Brothers until after seeing the HBO series.  If you liked the series, you won't be disappointed here.  You'll find that the series faithfully brought the book to life and that the book, like the series, pays due homage to the men of E Company.<br />This is, of course, the story of a single company of the 101st Airborne from the time of their inception to the conclusion of WWII.  For these men to have experienced even one of the battles described here would be considered heroic.  They literally made history and saved the world.  But they experienced much more than a single battle.  These men were there for Normandy, Market Garden, Bastogne, the Bulge, Berchtesgaden, etc.  If you cut any one of them open they would *bleed* history.<br />After seeing the series and reading the book, you can't help but stand in awe of these men.  Do men like Dick Winters, Guarnere, Powers, Malarkey, and others really exist?  Every day citizens were turned into incredible soldiers.  They came from nowhere, saved the world, and then went home again.  In these days where we have a standing professional army to fight our battles, it is difficult to imagine anything like this.  But there they are ambling down the street, these 80-year old men who seem to be driving too slow and sometimes get in the way.  Many would rather throw them on the scrap pile.  They are national treasures with incredible stories to tell and lessons to teach if only we would listen.
B000022TSW|5.0|This movie is the best movie in the year of 1999. If you like the TV show then you'll like the movie. It's has great variety of comedy such as that it is a musical, the jokes, and the script. Cartman is brilliant, and Kyle is still jewish. A funny new character that makes his appearence is \\"The Mole\\". This movie is funny and a great family movie. Buy it now.
B000002UAX|5.0|First heard WA when I was 15 and swooned.  I'm 42 and still in the full flush of the romance. It's wild, all over the place and captures The Beatles at a creative flashpoint. It's one of those albums that continually plays in my mind, long after the stereo has shut down for the night.  Granted, as Beatle fans know, WA is more like four solo artists working together than something Beatlesque as Hard Day's Night or Abbey Road (to point to a pair from different ends of the group's history). But when your soloists are McCartney, Lennon (now sadly deified by Yoko Ono and wide-eyed fans), Harrison and the much underrated Starr, you've got something magnificent on your hands.  I love the hell out of this album.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Seriously, I think people should actually review the album instead of saying, Oh I hate Britney Spears as your review.  Cuz that has no valid imput on the actual album.  Its like why review it then? Anyways, to my point Britney's latest album is pretty good.  I mean she did write some of the material and it isn't as shallow as that Dear Diary song.  The songs on the album are catchy.  You have to give her credit, she's trying.  I just have to say I am not a huge Britney Spear fan, nor do I idolize her, but I do like her music.  All throughout her albums her songs have always been catchy, fun, and make me feel good.  She has never failed with getting good producers, songwriters, and songs for her albums.  I think this album is her best album yet because it shows more of who she is.  I think \\"Overprotected\\", \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\", \\"I'm Not A girl, Not Yet a Woman\\" explains her situation and what she is going through.  Its more personal.  Plus she has songs anyone can relate to like \\"Boys\\", \\"Anticipating\\", \\"That's Where You Take Me\\", and \\"Cinderella\\". You really need to judge her music not her.
B00005YXZH|5.0|After Wilco abandoned his alt-country roots with Summer Teeth, I was interested in seeing where his next project would take him.  Well, alt-country die-hards might still be longing for those pioneering Tweedy days, but the rest of us will marvel at the evolution of this artist.<br />Yankee is an amazing record, from start to finish.  It builds off the moments of brilliance interspersed throughout Summer Teeth to create a consistently compelling album in what's becoming the Wilco sound: catchy yet complex, clever yet earnest, and emminently listenable- both the first time and the one hundredth time.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|This is incredible!  I've loved this musical since I was a kid and I read the script and T.S. Eliott's book The Old Possum's Guide To Practicle Cats (a must have for any Cats fan).  I have never been able to be in London or New York at the right time to see it, but I hope someday it will return to Broadway.  The video is incredible though, as you get a view closer than the front row seat and see the actors in and out of make-up.  My favorite movie, it's a full night of entertainment and more!
0553269631|4.0|The book, \\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" is a dark, yet very intelligent book about outcasts in the deep south during the 30s.  The book has three parts that each focus on a part of the five main character's lives.  <BR>Part one introduces Singer, the very main character of the novel.  Singer is a deaf mute who is depressed when his very best friend, Antonapoulous is sent to the nut house.  Biff is a local restaurant owner of the New York Caf.  Biff has to deal with his wife, Alice and their unhappy marriage.  Mick Kelly is a big tomboy in this part of the novel, who has a passion for music.  She has to deal with raising her two younger siblings.  Blount is a loud man who is faced with a drinking problem.  Dr. Copeland is a black doctor and struggles with a communicating with his children.  <BR>Part Two starts the plot of the book.  After each character is set up with his own disappointments and problems, Singer becomes the main character of the novel who listens to each of the other main characters and individually helps them with their own problems.  Singer is still struggling with the loss of his friend and occasionally visits him in the hospital.  During this part in the novel, Mick starts growing up, developing herself as a woman instead of a tomboy, and uses sex to get rid of her problems.  Biff's wife dies, and he has to deal with all the good memories he now remembers of her after it's too late.  Blount continues his drinking, but can't relate very well to Singer because he keeps accusing Singer of lying about being a deaf mute.  Dr. Copeland regains strength with his family and daughter, Portia, but later on finds out he is dying himself.  <BR>At the end of the novel, a tragedy occurs, leaving the main characters to fend for themselves, remember the past, and move on with their lives.  <BR>I would recommend this novel to anyone.  I enjoyed it and feel it really expresses how the human mind can sometimes feel left out of the world.  The novel was easy to read, and although it was a little depressing it was a great book.

Well, his amazing powerful vocals and the sheer magnitude of the band and above all else, the lyrics especially \\"Gloria\\" and \\"11 o,clock tick tock\\" are just the best hits of U2 and to hear them being performed live are just a dream come true!!! Yes it's 2002 but this album will always be heared blasting from my car!
B00005JKES|5.0|Hats off to everyone who harranged Spelling Productions for finally releasing some of David Lynch's and Mark Forst's venture into the macabre and supernatural.  However, there were two full seasons and although the later episodes were trite (and obviously at the behest of ABC) the middle episodes when BOB is revealed are crucial to the overall saga.  Please let's continue to push for all the episodes being released.

I was wary of the rumors and even some of the cuts I heard through the net were not immpressive on first listen. But after purchasing and listening to the cd the whole is much better than the parts. If you are unfamiliar with Wilco buy this. If you have heard the other releases and enjoyed them you will probably not be disappointed with YHF.
B00005YXZH|5.0|YHF is the best album to come out since SummerTeeth and possibly their best.  Musically and lyrically Tweedy and Co. are leaps and bounds above any other band I've heard since I don't know when and YHF just continues to prove it.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Nickelback is truly one of the best bands out of Canada to hit the states in some time. I've been waiting for them to get the exposure they have deserved for some time now..

B00002MZ4W|5.0|This album is breath-takingly stunning. Fiona Apple is not only a talented musician she is an musical genius. This album is both individual and clever. The tracks 'Limp' and 'Fast As You Can' are both fast paced and angry, tracks that make your heart race a little faster. Then there is 'I Know' and 'The Way Things Are', which are emotional ballads that are mellow and beautiful. I find myself relating completely to the lyrics in this album, I feel that everyone will have felt the way Fiona did in at least three of this albums songs. <BR>My only complaint is that the track list is only 10. Short album, but quality rather than quantity, eh?
B0000636UN|3.0|The original title for this disc was SONGS FROM THE WAITING ROOM. After a number of listens, I've come to the conclusion that it should have been called SONGS FROM THE DELIVERY ROOM: much of the CD feels labored and protracted. You can tell this album took over a year to make, and that towards the end Crow was feeling overwhelmed. The disc gets off to a good start, opening on an up note with \\"Steve McQueen\\", a fun rocker. All summery and shimmering, with a Steve Miller vibe and chorus, the track nevertheless sounds fresh(though never trendy!) when it uses some of the latest vocal alteration techniques. Next we have the CD's first single, \\"Soak Up The Sun.\\" What can I say? This is pure pop perfection....a classic Summer driving song! It's not deep, but it's fun(\\"I'm gonna soak up the sun/Got my 45 on/So I can rock on\\"). With it's catchy chorus, people will be humming - or singing! - this song for months! Track #3 is \\"You're An Original\\", a stinging commentary about our current society that features some of Crow's best lyrics to date, as well as a great harmony vocal from Lenny Kravitz. While on the surface it seems to be addressing the Christina Spears and Synchstreet Boys of today's entertainment field, \\"You're An Original\\" could just as well be acknowledging a portion of today's youth who expect things handed to them and, when passed over in favor of another, can't understand why. It's with C'MON, C'MON's next track that things start to get choppy. \\"Safe And Sound\\" is a gorgeous break-up song, full of hurt, pain and anguish. With a different arrangement it could have been a classic album closer ala Fleetwood Mac's \\"Songbird.\\" Crow would have been wise to go the solo piano and delicate vocal route; instead, she piles on the strings and a howling banshee wail, resulting in a bloated, bombastic production. The disc's title track sports a nice, relaxed guitar vibe, all magical and twinkling, but Stevie Nicks is all but wasted on backing vocals. \\"It's So Easy\\" is a swarmy duet with Don Henley that's only on the disc for it's \\"star power.\\" A \\"Cheatin'heart, if your-wife-only-knew\\" song, it's an embarrassment for a writer of Crow's quality. \\"Over You\\" is a lovely song, with universal lyrics that everyone has lived thru(\\"I feel like cherry wine/Like Valentines/Like a Spring is coming/And everything is all right/I've got a love that's new/I hear you're happy too/That's the way it should be/But lately I feel like crying\\"). \\"Lucky Kid\\" opens with a nice sequenced vocal, beat- box vibe, a groove that should have been followed thru. Instead, it veers into noisy 70's arena rock. Brie Darling, late of the Boxing Gandhis, could have added some killer percussion and backing vocals to the track, making it a sexy, hip, contemporary dance club rave. \\"Diamond Road\\" features another wasted backing vocal from Stevie Nicks (why have one one of the most distinct female voices in rock history on your album if you can't hear her?!?), alongside a nice, mid-tempo Beatlesesque sway and sweet lyrics(\\"Walk with me the diamond road/Tell me every story told/Give me something of your soul/That I can hold onto/I want to wake up to the sound of waves/Crashing on a brand new day/Keep the memory of your face/But wipe the pain away\\" and \\"So don't miss the diamonds along the way/Every road has led us here today\\"). Next up is the CD's most notable misstep, the disasterous \\"It's Only Love.\\" Crow wrote this beautiful song for Nicks, who delivered a gorgeous, definitive version on her recent TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA. Crow's pales by comparison. The intimacy seems forced and/or secondhand, the strings are all wrong, and the song ultimately crumbles under it's own weight. A number of other tracks didn't make the final cut for inclusion onto C'MON, C'MON: I can't help but believe that one of them should have taken the place of this major blunder. \\"Abilene\\" is classic Crow, though here too it is hard to distiguish Natalie Maines' backing vocals. \\"Hole In My Pocket\\" is a brilliant track, one of the CD's highpoints. It captures the album's (supposed) theme of great summer cruising music, mixing modern hip-hop with classic 70's rock, with a touch of 60's Motown tossed in. This could have been the CD's closer. Instead, they chose \\"Weather Channel\\", a beautiful, albeit dreary, downbeat, song that features ethereal harmony vocals from Emmylou Harris. Weary, aching, defeated.....this somber track shouldn't have been used to close the CD; instead, it would have been a good break between two rockers. So what is next for Sheryl Crow? Hopefully an easy \\"delivery\\", one on which she can just have fun. No one should have to work (or hurt) this hard.ant track, one of the CD's highpoints.

B00000IQC8|5.0|CLERKS is a film that a bunch of buddies and I watched repeatedly in college.  Even after having seen the film more times that I can count, there's still something there that can make me laugh.  If you haven't seen it, then you certainly should, as long as you aren't one to be easily offended.  However, a word of warning to the uninitiated: the movie originally received an NC-17 rating based purely on the raunchy dialog.  <br />The characters in CLERKS are some of the most memorable and entertaining people that you'll ever see in a movie.  Becoming more familiar with the film after multiple viewings, it may surprise you when you realize exactly how small the roles are of some of the unforgettable inhabitants of Clerksworld.  Olaf the Berserker, Snowball, the various angry, irritable customers, and others don't really have all that much screen-time, but I'll wager that many people will be quoting their favorite lines and insults to their friends for weeks after seeing the film.<br />Of course, the main selling points of the film are the two lead characters, the eponymous Dante and Randall.  Relatively speaking, they both have the same job.  Dante works in a convenience store, Randall in a video store.  Because he lets his boss walk all over him, Dante always gets stuck with the worst shifts, and dealing with the worst customers.  He can't make up his mind over his love life or his future.  He has no idea what he wants to make of himself.  On the other hand, Randall delights in showing up late for work, temporarily closing the store any time he wants to hang out in the convenience store (which is practically the entire movie), and \\"ripping into the occasional customer\\".  He is in exactly the place he wants to be, as the low ambitions he sets for himself have been achieved.  The two characters play off of each other perfectly.  One is angry, but content to mutter and complain about the terrible hand of fate, while the other is satisfied by hanging out with his friend on company time and wasting as much of the work day as possible.<br />The commentary track on the DVD (originally recorded during a break in the filming of MALLRATS and meant for the Laserdisc edition of the film) offers quite a bit of insight in the script, the background, and the filming.  Unfortunately, the recording took place using only a single microphone that was passed around to the various people sitting in the room.  So while the DVD box claims that a lot of the cast and crew were involved, it is actually made up primarily of Kevin Smith with only cameos from the rest of the participants. Still, Smith does offer quite a bit of behind the scenes trivia, and after starting in a faintly overly-defensive mood, really loosens up and gives one the impression of someone who is still quite proud of his work, but isn't blind to all faults.<br />The most notable person on the commentary track without the initials K.S. is Jason Mewes, who spends the entirety in a drunken stupor, only waking up briefly to swear, to claim that he loves chicks, and to incorrectly quote his own lines from MALLRATS.  The primitive method of recording the commentary means that when other people in the room remark on parts of the movie, we can hear Smith responding to them, but we can't hear the original comment that inspired the reply.  It's a fairly frustrating listening experience, but ultimately one that is still rewarding.<br />The other DVD extras are well worth viewing as well.  There's a whole bunch of scenes that were cut from the final version of the film and there is also an alternative ending that, thankfully, Kevin Smith had the good sense to remove before releasing the film to theatres.  The Soul Asylum music video is entertaining enough, and lets you watch a short version of the CLERKS hockey game sequence in color and with the band members playing along.<br />Buy this DVD.  It's a whole lot of fun.  It's got comedy, romance, action, idiots, stoners, and geeks talking about science fiction.  It's also got Jay and Silent Bob, who are worth the price of admission just by themselves.

B000003TAR|5.0|&quot;In Utero&quot; is unquestionably Nirvana's finest. Before you begin ranting about the worthlessness of this opinion, bear in mind one indispensible fact: Kurt felt that this final album was the closest approximation to what he was attempting to achieve with the band. To paraphrase his words, he saw &quot;Bleach&quot; as just a quick record to hook the major labels and thought &quot;Nevermind&quot; had production that was, in his own exact description, far too &quot;slick&quot;. Of course &quot;Bleach&quot; and &quot;Nevermind&quot; still bear certain trademarks of perfection but don't be an ignorant fan-&quot;In Utero&quot; was meant to be their definitive statement and it is. As close as &quot;Nevermind&quot; comes, &quot;In Utero&quot; wins for being more mature and better at displaying Kurt's most distinctive trait-his purely personal stance in his music. &quot;Serve the Servants&quot; says more about Nirvana to me than &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; ever will, &quot;Dumb&quot; can hold its own with &quot;Polly&quot;, and &quot;All Apoligies&quot;, not &quot;Something in the Way&quot;, was the ultimate Nirvana closer.
B00005QK3W|3.0|The problem with Paul McCartney is not that he can't still write good songs, he certainly can. The problem with McCartney as a solo artist is that he has always badly needed an editor or a better producer to comb through all of his material and pick the best songs. The Beatles were great at doing that for McCartney and the results speak for themselves. Almost all of McCartney's solo records have some great songs on them but then some duds. Driving Rain has some great songs on it. From a Lover To A Friend is a classic haunting ballad. Lonely Road is edgy and passionately performed. The title track is entertaining. In fact, about half of this record is very good. It is the other half that I find myself skipping past. 16 songs is simply too many. And where is Vanilla sky? That song is great! McCartney is one of the all time greats in Rock music history regardless if he ever made another stop the presses classic record or not. My advice to amazon readers if they are wanting a copy of this record, by it used and enjoy it for what it is. A good but flawed record.
0449002128|5.0|I've read a lot of books non-fiction and fiction on the Intelligence community from around the world. Its obvious from Daniel's book that he's done his research right in getting the feel and capabilities of the agents fictionalized in the book. I urge you to read the resources that he lists at the end of the book as well if you want more info.<br /> The book is set in modern times, concerning an Israeli agent who's mastered the art of restoration as a cover to such a degree that he in fact became one of the world's best art restorers. The story does not circle around this fact. It is about the chase of an old rival bent on destoying the mideast peace process and the details involved in preparing and executing the mission from both sides.<br /> There are some twists in the end of the story to be sure. It is a fast paced, action adventure story that takes you across Europe which also touches upon both side (Israeli/Palestinian) views of the peace process and the history of Isreal.<br /> I will be definately reading more books of this sort from Daniel Silva.

B00005QIPH|5.0|O.K., I feel I am entitled to a worthy opinion, here. Why? Because I am one of those \\"Velvet Underground snobs\\", alright? I started listening to them when I was 17. Other similar bands that soon followed included Television and the Stooges, y'know-the proto/post punk classics. One of the most interesting topics for music afficianados like me is that of the \\"origins of punk\\". You know, we're the type of people who tease those who think punk started in '77. It's a fun role we play and I respect our great music taste-we have the honor of respecting some of the coolest music ever made. Yet when does this type of musical snobiness go too far?.....Along came the Strokes in 2001, when I was about 19 and a half. I saw them performing on SNL; the drummer was wearing a tee with Andy Warhol's famed banana drawing on it. I quickly played the role of the Velvet Underground snob-these guys are just ripping off the godfathers of indie rock, etc., etc., blah, blah, blah...It would take me about six months after their debut album was released to get over myself and my holier-than-thou mentality. I finally decided to give \\"Is This It\\" a fair shot and an open-minded listen. First off, the title of this album is one big punchline. You slip in the disc and see that you are only getting about 36 minutes of music. Fine by me, some of the best albums I've ever heard are short and don't make the mistake of wearing out their welcome. So there you go, one joke that relates to the title. I am not sure if anyone has mentioned the three second pause before the first song. In my opinion, it's there for a purposeful reason. Is it another reference to the title, as many will ask that question the first time they hear the silence, a way of poking fun at the excessive media hype, or a valuable reminder that is never actually mentioned on the album-one to remember to stop searching for life's meaning (you won't find it as the silence shows) and just enjoy the simple pleasures it has to offer. The Strokes never mention this intention in any lyrics but the beauty is that they don't need to. The songs themselves are the \\"simple pleasures\\" and the Strokes make an effort to prove they are the best ones. Every song is straight-up rock with no pretentious influences or timely cliches. No song wears out its welcome. The truth is that these simple tunes are very enjoyable-to the point where I am tired of playing the Velvet Underground snob. Sure there may be some similarities, but the Strokes have their own sense of melody and it is a very strong one. These are great songs with great songwriting and this album is both refreshing and addictive. For those reasons, I will not apoligize for being a fan of the Strokes. This is not music that will save the world, let's not be childish. This is music that expresses the feelings and memories I have for what's real-and that's my everyday life. For that reason, it will survive. In an age where we are waiting for so-called \\"rock saviors\\", the Strokes are laughing their rear ends off. Music is by people and for people and the enjoyment they share together (not this rock star worshipping) is all that really matters in life as this album shows. Take it or leave it.
B00005R23S|5.0|As a Springsteen fan who hasn't had a chance to see him and the E Street Band live, this DVD of his performances in NYC was excellent. The quality of the picture and sound is superb. Crank up the home theatre system, sit back, watch and listen to the Boss and the band. This concert showcases the band's best - not all the songs were hits or even released as singles, but all are among Springsteen's best and the DVD shows the versatility of all the players in the band. Just awesome!

What might have been a simple enough five hour car ride becomes an epic journey when he decides to travel the 300<br />miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin on a riding lawnmower :<br />  I've got to go see Lyle, and I've got to make the trip on my own.<br />Along the way he meets a young runaway girl; a woman who plows into a deer in front of him, apparently a near daily occurrence for her; a couple<br />who allow him to spend a few days with them after he fries a motor on a steep downhill grade; a fellow WWII vet tending bar; and finally a pastor in<br />whose cemetery he stops overnight.  Over the course of the six week sojourn he slowly reveals himself and his regrets for his part in the feud that has<br />separated him from his brother.  As he tells the pastor:<br />  I want to sit with him and look up at the stars, like we used to, so long ago.<br />When finally he gets to Lyle's place, his penance done, the two do indeed sit in comfortable silence on the front porch, as the stars come up<br />overhead.  It's the kind of speechless togetherness that only people who truly love one another are capable of maintaining and enjoying.<br />This is entirely Richard Farnsworth's film, a role he richly deserved after a lifetime in the movies.  He began in Hollywood as a teenager in 1937,<br />doubled for Roy Rogers and Gary Cooper, drove a chariot in The Ten Commandments, worked as a stuntman, a role player, and only very<br />occasionally the lead.  Farnsworth was one of the few truly conservative people left in Hollywood and maybe the only one in recent memory who<br />sometimes turned down films that failed to meet his own ethical standards--as regards profanity, sex, and violence.  Somehow--and I've no idea<br />how--that integrity was etched into his face.<br />In the underrated movie The Big Kahuna there's a scene early on where a young man tells Danny DeVito that a secretary said he'd be easily<br />recognizable because his face has character.  Later on there are scenes where DeVito is almost preternaturally calm and the only forward momentum<br />of the story is supplied by that character-filled face.  Farnsworth had such a face too and that's an exceedingly rare quality in any human being, but<br />especially an actor, particularly in a day and age when special effects, plastic surgery, and bad scripts have made it easy to cast pleasant looking idiots<br />in most movie roles.  Recall the scene in Sunset Boulevard when Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) says : \\"We had faces then\\".  In that silent era<br />faces were required because they had to communicate.  Today, when the films don't even bother trying to communicate anything, who cares if the<br />faces say anything?  Well, when you see what a real face, like Farnsworth's, can convey, you'll realize what we're missing.<br />Fittingly, this was Richard Farnsworth's last role.  Like Alvin Straight he went out on his own terms; stricken with a painful terminal cancer, he shot himself on October 6, 2000.<br />GRADE : Aruly conservative people left in Hollywood and maybe the only one in recent memory who <BR>sometimes turned down films that failed to meet his own ethical standards--as regards profanity, sex, and violence.

0140067477|5.0|Hoff uses Pooh Bear and all of the other characters from Winnie the Pooh to ease a seeker into understanding Buddhism, Taoism and the general balance of the universe, a little bit better. This book was different from many other books on Buddhism/Taoism, in that it is playful and imaginative, rather than concrete and absorbed in discipline and standards. I think that this is a great read for anybody interested in the Asian religions, who also can appreciate the cute, yet meaningful metaphors that Hoff offers within this book.

B00005YXZH|5.0|The current state of the record industry can be summed up in three words: \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\". These three words (also the title of said album) became the buzz for nearly a year when seminal alt-country act Wilco submitted their now notorious album to Reprise, their label of almost ten years (at the time). They [Reprise] in turn rejected it. One must wonder what they were thinking- or if it was in fact the retooling of Warner Brothers that was the cause of this. At any rate, Reprise was more than fair about their [Wilco] refusal to alter or edit it and allowed the band opt out of their contract; something rare and practically unheard of in these cut-throat times. Even stranger was that they let them [Wilco] buy the album rights for a mere..., which the band did.<br />Furthering the drama of all of this was the addition of a new drummer (Glenn Kotche), the first non-band member (Jim O'Rourke) being allowed to co-produce/mix it, and most surprising, the multi-instrumental Jay Bennett leaving at the completion of the album to what most say wasn't as amicable as both he and Tweedy would have you believe. Did I mention the documentary being filmed for the entire process of writing, recording, and the above mentioned drama? All of this while the September 25th 2001 date for release came and went. Yes it would seem all Tweedy and co. needed was for Yoko to lurk in the studio for all of this. <br />But unlike those[\\"Let It Be\\"] now famous sessions for the Fab Four, Wilco (basically Tweedy) merely shrugged it off, streamed the album from their site; something that caused many in this digital age to scratch their heads over, did some touring, and shopped for a new label all while continuing to let Sam Jones film it all.<br />After a short bidding war (which did include Reprise actually making a bid!), Wilco decided on Nonesuch Records, an eclectic label that houses artist types like Phillip Glass, The Magnetic Fields and now of course Wilco. The true irony comes though, when one realizes that Nonesuch is part of Warner Brothers. You have to wonder if this was all some sort of elaborate insider contract renegotiation. At any rate, some minor mixing changes were made (supposedly), some neat extra CD-ROM junk thrown in, and finally, after all the pain and suffering, an April 23rd date was set for the album's release.<br />You have to wonder a few things though. First, is the fact that most if not ALL the die hard Wilco fans having the album already on mp3 will affect the sales- something that will surely have marketing executives all over the world watching in the next month or so. And secondly, if all the buzz, hype and intrigue will push Wilco out of cult status into the mainstream and/or generate their first potential platinum album domestically. It's a toss up, between the \\"mp3 situation\\", and of course- something many have forgotten in all of this drama, the music. Judging by the music, great things could and should be in store for Wilco.<br />The first thing one will notice upon pressing play is the noisy intro with acoustic guitar strumming and a marching drum beat into the album's first track \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\\". Subsequently, this is also the film's title. Then begins Jeff's scratchy crooning of: \\"I am an American aquarium drinker, I assassin down the avenue\\"...and one is grabbed and quite frankly not released until the album's final track \\"Reservations\\". The thing that might strike the listener is that the album really isn't that experimental, or unapproachable. To the contrary, the Jim O'Rourke influenced sounds that have become somewhat notorious, barely stick out, and are mostly used in the intros and endings of a good many of the songs and quite frankly, blend quite well. You have to really wonder- if this is in fact the same tapes they turned into Reprise, what the hell were they complaining about. One thing perhaps that bothered them- which really started on their last album \\"Summerteeth\\", is their all butabandonment of any alt-country sound whatsoever. The only song that remotely even sounds alt-country is perhaps \\"Jesus, etc.\\" a song that uses a very Dave Matthews-esque fiddle sound throughout it. But really, with Glenn Kotche's drumming on that song- something that really sticks out through the rest of this album as well, there is no country sound at all! As a matter of fact, after listening to this album's eleven tracks, one is left wondering if Wilco twang are through for good. That might possibly have been Reprise's thinking, but who knows? Most Wilco fans will tell you though, that they saw this coming with each release. Also, looking at Tweedy's influences, which range from Bob Dylan and Gram Parsons, to the Beatles and the Replacements, you have to probably think; after looking at Tweedy's work thus far, that this shift was inevitable. And quite frankly, Wilco as at their collective best with it. With songs like \\"Kamera\\" and \\"I'm The Man Who Loves You\\" \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" grooves an awful lot for an album deemed commercially unviable. Although songs like \\"Radio Cure\\", the opening track and \\"Reservations\\"- which show Tweedy's oh so lovable, melancholy, brooding manner, just might make a case to the contrary. But who wants an album of all happy songs? <br />The only track that really may seem \\"out there\\" or experimental just may by far be the album's best song as well. On \\"Poor Places\\", abstract lyrical metaphors mixed with a cacophony of buzzes and sounds while piano and acoustic guitars swirl to a climax of a computerized voice repeating over and over the album title's code words (which are actually part of the short hand radio's phonetic alphabet). This amazing sonic construction transports the listener to the seaside port the song metaphorically references. This song reminisces of days of old where experimenting was a good thing, and just may perhaps solidify Wilco's tiptoeing into becoming one of the world's best bands- something most of the die-hard fans will tell you happened two albums ago on \\"Being There\\", their 1996 double CD release.<br />It seems Jeff Tweedy has certainly carved his place out as a genius of sorts with \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\", which quite frankly is truly one of the best albums of the last ten years, easily. One just wonders if in this manufactured pop climate that it will even get the just attention and credit it deserves. Judging by the treatment of the labels, one must just sit, wait and more importantly hope. Jeff sums it up best on the song \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\". \\"I miss the innocence I've known, playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned\\" Yes Jeff, where have those days gone...
B00005V1Y0|5.0|The story is pretty conventional : since childhood Scott Hastings' parents have pointed him towards the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Amateur<br />Championships.  But in direct contravention of the rules and traditions of ballroom dancing (which have as much to do with the teaching of dance to<br />willing customers as with dance itself), Scott has recently developed a dangerous desire to dance his own \\"crowd-pleasing steps\\".  When Scott's<br />partner leaves him, he's forced to audition new ones, none of whom are very satisfactory, until, improbably, the homely and awkward Fran, who<br />usually has to dance with another girl, demonstrates that she understands what he's aiming at.  As Scott's mother and teacher try to find a more<br />acceptable alternative, Scott and Fran practice in secret, eventually receiving assistance from Fran's aforementioned father and her loving<br />grandmother, who does a mean rumba herself.<br />What follows is largely predictable but still endearingly romantic and exciting.  Baz Luhrmann, who had directed a stage version of the story for some<br />ten years before turning it into a movie, brings a pulsing energy (which mixes soundtrack, color, and motion in fascinating ways) and an off-kilter<br />sense of humor to the film that make it quite distinctive.  If you liked Mr. Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge but thought it was a bit over-the-top, you'll like<br />this one much better.<br />The best aspect of the film though is the way in which Scott, who when we meet him is totally self-absorbed, has to learn that for all his desire to<br />express himself in dance, he must do so together with his partner.  He and Fran must communicate with one another, share themselves, and be able to<br />yield something of the personal in order to be true to their art.  They must respect the conventions of ballroom dance, with its basis in the couple,<br />even as they expand its possibilities and violate the self-serving diktats of the corrupt elders who run the competitions.  So much of modern art and<br />literature celebrates egotistical individualism unfettered by any restraint; it's unusual to find such a compelling story about the requirement of<br />submerging purely selfish concerns in order to achieve higher purposes.<br />One of the leitmotifs of the film is that \\"A life lived in fear is a life half-lived\\".  Much of the atomization of modern life is a function of fear, a fear of<br />being hurt by those we open up to.  Scott begins the film as only half of a couple, unable to share anything, even a dance, with his partner.  He is<br />living only a half-life.  But he becomes wholly human, begins to live a whole life, when he becomes a true partner with Fran.  It's rare enough to see<br />such profound truth portrayed in film, but that it's done here such a joyous and exuberant fashion makes this a remarkable movie.<br />GRADE : A+So much of modern art and <BR>literature celebrates egotistical individualism unfettered by any restraint; it's unusual to find such a compelling story about the requirement of <BR>submerging purely selfish concerns in order to achieve higher purposes.<br />One of the leitmotifs of the film is that \\"A life lived in fear is a life half-lived\\".

God is Love show the spiritual side of R&B. Buy it!
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Enrique is one seductive, sensational, alluring Latino singer I ever fell for One night stand Listening after Ricky Martin n George Michael. His voice is so enticing when I heard Bailamos but this one is just a cool Pick. All the numbers are great catchy tunes and lust driven freaky numbers you love to hear and especially the video of Hero is fantastic as Enrique express his deep inner feelings. Escape (Escaper) are both cool numbers that you can't escape to feel high as you watch the video along! It's truly like You can run, you can hide but can't truly escape from his love. (aunque corras, te escondasno puedes escapar) I will survive lyric words are full of determination to overcome the pain of lost love. Love to see you cry is one number that is passionate singing. Don't Turn of the Lights, Maybe, Love for fun are good humming numbers for a change. Even if you are not a fan or a pop freak, Enrique's voice is cool and inviting that would make you feel great and imagine, I heard he hates drugs, cigarettes, coakroaches and he loves to windsurf in carribean, watch Television bloopers, black color,dancing at night, eating hamburgers n all. One Night Stand is just a 'fling' and sure, you can relax n listen this cool Album - all toppers in my chart!

B00005QZWI|5.0|This is the second review written for this item... I just wanted to write this to say.... THIS SOUNDTRACK ROCKS! My previous review (why you need this cd) was thought out and organized. I love the movie, all the tolkein books, etc. I know, I know... This review will be helpful to absolutely no one... But just to let you people know how enthusiastic I am about how awesome everything related to tolkien is, I want to say, as far as soundtracks go... THIS IS SUCH A COOL CD!<BR>(Really... It's got a lot of nice, depressing songs which are really great after a horrible day at school, or work, or wherever... Great to go to sleep in your headphones, very moody music. Not \\"this cd rocks\\" as in it has a beat or is pop rock or anything... it really doesn't. It's just kind of calming and very... [as I said b4] moody.)
B0000633T6|3.0|This movie was fun to watch, and had some interesting plot twists; however, what made this movie seem even more far fetched than other spy thrillers is the fact that the movie makes the CIA look like a bunch of idiots and the only smart and clever one is 24 hours from retirement. <br />I also have to agree with one of the reviewers about the fact that Redford and Pitt look exactly the same throughout the entire movie despite there being scenes from fifteen to twenty years in the past.<br />I thought the movie was a bit slow and that the ending came a little fast, but I found it entertaining enough to hold my interest for the 127 minutes it lasted.

B00004WKII|5.0|For those familiar with Hendrix, there is a lot of fresh versions and out-takes of songs that we are mostly acquainted with, but also some new songs.  It is really quite an exciting sampling of the creative and hard-working side of Hendrix that the average commercial listener is not aware of.  As much as his musical talent is reputed, he was as much (if not more) an ever expanding artist.  The versions and experiments of songs in this collection really are a treat to listen to.  For those who consider themselves unfamiliar with Hendrix, you will find a very full sound and super sound quality (considering that most of the songs exhibited in this collection were not intended on being released).  The accompanying book with the box set by itself is almost worth the money (not really, but it is very well done).  The only negative for the unfamiliar fan is that several songs are repeated one or more times.  But for me, each is so different (a tribute to Hendrix's expressiveness), that I love hearing them together.  Summary:  An excellent tribute, and valuable educational musical product.
B0000636UN|5.0|I bought this the first day it was out and I must admit the first time or two I listened to this CD I wasn't sure whether I liked it as much as I'd hoped. But I also felt that way with &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot;. I think the entire point of Sheryl's music is that it forces you to think and to become deeply involved in it. I have to say that the track that speaks to me most is &quot;Diamond Road&quot;. For anyone who's ever gone through times when it just seemed too difficult to go on, she's talking to you. &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; - I can't say enough about it. Every time I hear this song I am instantly in a good mood. I know that the critics haven't given this CD rave reviews, and maybe some people won't &quot;get it&quot;, but it's good music, and she's doing what she does best - writing strong songs with good lyrics and haunting melodies. Give it a chance and get hooked!
0898457556|5.0|Here we have Paul Scofield and Sir Ralph Richardson with a supporting cast doing justice to this Dickens Masterpiece. Yes it is abridged, but the story does not suffer from this. I think this is much better than Patrick Stewart's recording, which attempts to tell the story with Mr. Stewart doing all the characters by himself. Which is a good effort, but this recording<br />is a little bit more like an old radio play, and I think tells the story more effectively.

B000JVSUS4|1.0|Sorry, but I just have to laugh at all these 5 star reviews.  This movie is utter and complete trash!!!  I really have to scratch my head at the plot of this thing.  With all the real stories that went on that day, the producers felt it was much better to create this preposterous fictional love triangle.  Anyone who has ever read anything about Pearl Harbor knows there were plenty of interesting REAL stories that were going on about REAL people.  Unfortunately, the producers want to treat movie goers like kids and assume you want to see fake cliche stories that have been done to death.  Okay, fine.  Let's move on to the BIG problem I had with this movie.  Ben &#34;Superman&#34; Affleck.  I think Mike Bay must have had a serious man crush on the guy or something.  Affleck is in your face and all over the screen.  He is in Britain downing down German planes.  He gets shot down, but survives without a scratch.  Next, he's pulling sailors out of the water in Pearl, he's barnstorming out a hanger, he's shooting down Japanese planes with ease, he's giving blood in the hospital, he's flying bombers off of an aircraft carrier, he's bombing Japan, he's gunning down an entire platoon of Japanese soldiers..........and he gets the pretty girl.  Whew!!!  Busy day for big Ben.  I'm surprised he didn't get a red cape to go with his flight suits. Meanwhile, the film gives about 10 minutes of token recognition to a real hero, Dorie Miller.  I think they did that just to give Superman a breather,  Heck, its hard work taking on the entire Japanese military on your own.  They also add a few more &#34;filler&#34; scenes like that.  You know, unimportant things like tactics, historical information, and trivialities like the entire reason why we were attacked.  Micheal Bay doesn't have time for such things.  He's too busy thinking about what he can blow up.  It also seems he doesn't have time for technical advisers on the set.  The movie is so riddled with historical inaccuracies that itdefies description.  I suppose the response to that would be that history is ignored to a point so that the movie would be more &#34;entertaining&#34;.  Which really makes you wonder why someone would choose America's single greatest military defeat as entertainment that teaches so very little.  This movie is not concerned about history nor does it care about why this battle even happened.<br /><br />So, viewers with no interest in WWII, but love cheesy chick flicks, will probably like this movie a lot.  To me, this movie is an insult.
B00003CX5P|5.0|George Lucas's original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy is a brilliant, if incomplete, contribution to the world of film. With the prequel trilogy the story will finally be completed -- as the original trilogy told of the fall of the Empire, here at last is the story of its rising. ... I am immensly pleased with this beginning episode in the miniseries that \\"Star Wars\\" really is. It is my hope that someday not only the original half of \\"Star Wars,\\" but the entire six-part movie, will go down in film history with the word \\"classic\\" attached to it. It certianly is one in my mind.<br />Episode I is set a long time ago in the same galexy far, far away as the original three movies, but unlike the originals the galexy we see here is pretty much at peace. Instead of an all-out war, we see the evil Sith making their first subtle moves to bring down the Jedi Order and this said peace with it: The Trade Federation's blockade of the remote planet Naboo allows Senator Palpatine (Darth Siduos) to become Suprime Chancellor and by doing so sets a series of events into motion which will ultumately bring the fall of the Jedi, setting the stage for the original trilogy's story of rebellion and the return of peace, and it will be very interesting to see how exactly the Empire continues to rise in Episodes II and III. Episode I is indeed a very light, nonwar film, focusing instead on the arena of polotics, but the lightness here is needed to contrast the darkness that lies ahead, and I was expecting something of this sort.  It is a thrilling, if different, beginning to \\"Star Wars,\\" and one that I highly reccomend.<br />As for the DVD edition itself - all I can say about it is wow.  The film's presentation is flawless, and contains a previously unreleased deleted scene \\"The Air Taxi Sequence\\" which was completed and reincuperated into the film just for the DVD release.  The audio commentary track is genius, and even the menus are fun.  The second disc contains a wealth of bonus materials includingmore completed deleted sequences, a 66-minute new making-of doccumentary as well as five featurettes focusing on certian aspects of the film and the 12-part web doccumentary series that debuted on starwars.com during the movie's production.  Also included are trailers, TV spots, the \\"Duel of the Fates\\" music video, footage on the making of the popular videogame \\"Star Wars: Starfighter,\\" and more.  The only better DVD I've seen out there yet is \\"Snow White\\" from Disney.  This set will go a long way towards making it up to people who unlike me are a bit disappointed in the film.<br />A great film made even better by a great DVD set.  If this is any indication of what the original trilogy's DVDs will be like, they too will be amazing.  Great job, Lucasfilm!
B00005YXZH|5.0|I've been a Wilco fan for a few years, but this record trumps even my expectations.  Their talent pours out of the speakers for 51 minutes.  It's truly a record that needed to be made, and one that needs to be heard.  It's not your average shallow pop music, so those who just want to listen to whining should probably skip it.  This record was designed to make you think, so if that isn't a problem for you, then I can't recommend this record enough.  Enjoy.
B0000636UN|3.0|Disappointing, not living up to advance press.  Over-produced, not as interesting as previous 2 studio albums.  If you buy it with low expectations you might be happy with it.  Still better than most new music by a long shot.
B00005B36H|5.0|this cd is mind blowing, the guitar and bass work so well together. if you play guitar like i do, you will appreciate this album more for its great sound, and difficult and technical guitar work. but this album is stll a must for any heavy music person.
B000002AH7|3.0|This is one of the low points of the Miles-Evans collaborations. Its not awful, but is not a great Miles Davis album. Esential recording? Not a chance. Go for the originial Concierto de aranjuez by Rodrigo and if you want to listen to the best of Miles-Evans get Miles Ahead or Porgy and Bess.
B00005JKED|4.0|'Training Day' is a very different film to what would fit into the ordinary \\"buddy cop\\" genre; this film presents a subversion of all that is sacred in the \\"buddy cop\\" film, and it pays off. Denzel Washington's performance is incendiary and gives the entire film a sense of class that was needed to make this film feel sophisticated, yet rough, while not falling into cliché's.<br />As the title suggests 'Training Day' is the first day for new cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) the character is set up as a young, idealistic rookie who's dream it has been to uphold the law. This character type is the exact opposite to his mentor Alonzo Harris (Washington) who is a veteran of the streets, a man whose street savvy is only rivaled by his pure vileness. The next 24 hours prove to break Jake down, confront his morals, and meanwhile feel a sense of duty towards his 'trainer'. The characters snake their way through corruption, drugs and a myriad of other situations on the mean streets of L.A.<br />It is truly easy to see why Denzel won the 'Best Actor' Oscar this year. Normally the audience is used to seeing him in a protagonistic, good guy role. It was a huge risk for Denzel to present this side of his acting ability, and thank goodness he did. Alonzo is pure evil, who whilst both Jake and the audience can see his stilted moral views is oblivious to his own problems. As far as an antagonist goes it's the character that truly thinks they are doing the right thing that will appear more evil.<br />Despite this Ethan Hawke's performance cannot be underestimated. It is the perfect supporting character that plays the rookie cop role perfectly. His reactions to Alonzo's actions are so truly believable the audience feels the emotions along with Jake, and it is here the film makes so many gains. <br />In the fabulous direction of Antoine Fuqua the mixture of cop story, and hip-hop lifestyle is mixed perfectly. The two facets fit perfectly rather than seeming too separated. His use of time lapse shots at the beginning is a very effective technique as we are set up with a fast pace that is continued in depicting the entire 24 hours of the 'Training Day'. The camera work fits in perfectly is portraying the nitty, gritty world the film presents, and I hope to see more from this upcoming director.<br />The DVD is one of the best one-disc films around. An amazing amount of features are fit into the disc, an HBO making of, Commentary, deleted scenes, alternate ending etc. make this the best way to fully immerse yourself in the film. As far as the transfer goes the picture on 'Training Day' is some of the prettiest on offer. It's crystal clear, as is the sound with every note of rap blaring from Alonzo's car radio sounding brilliant.<br />'Training Day' is an amazing film, a successful subversion of the average cop film. The performances are fantastic, the narrative is tight, and slick, plus it's so easy to see why this film won Denzel his first best actor Oscar. This will be one for the ages, and must be seen by anyone who enjoys a very well structured film.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I just got back from the store with it and it is 12:39 on the day of release.  I heard the album before when it was streamed on the internet, but that was crackly and of low quality.  I also caught most of the songs live, but I must say that this is a quality listening experience.  From the first moment of &quot;I am trying to break your heart&quot;, when Jeff Tweedy sings &quot;I'm an american aquarium drinker...&quot;, you realize you are about to &quot;experience&quot; an album as opposed to listening to a catchy song.  If you are prepared for a challenging, yet completely rewarding experience, check this album out.  Chances are, it may be the most important and well-received album of the year.  Reprise Records' loss is definitely our gain.  This much delayed album is worth the wait and the time it takes to fully appreciate it.  I fully suggest that anyone who appreciates intelligent, intense, emotional, yet challenging music treat themselves to this record.  Then, at the end of the year, when all of the critics and music lists are talking about it, you will be in the know.<BR>My gift to you.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This is an awesome CD and if you get a chance to see John in concert, GO!
B00005JKED|1.0|I thought this movie was a ridiculous attempt at turning a good guy into a bad guy.  Denzel Washington isn't very good at pretending to be a bad guy. <BR>The movie drags on for 2 hours and has no point what so ever.  Personally I turned the movie off after the first 45 mins because I was so bored.<BR>I think if someone wants to see a good movie...they should avoid training day.
B00005JKJA|5.0|There isn't a lot that you can say about this film without giving away the experience.  People have assaulted me to tell me how much they hated it, but I can only attribute their  responses to the fact that you need to think about this one instead of swallowing it whole: for them I highly recommend the new release of the recut E.T.  Lynch's films traditionally require you to fling yourself through the air and to throw away any preconceived notions of Hollywood narrative - you yourself as the audience needs to exist in the surreal with as little grasp on the confines of this material world as possible.  If you can do that, Mulholland Dr. is quite a ride.<br />I love this movie.  It has haunted me since I first saw it and it compels you to view it repeatedly. Naomi Watts is phenomenal and deserved the Oscar nod for her work here, as did Lynch.  Ever since my first viewing, I have felt elated that something so brilliant and magnetic was created.<br />The DVD is does not have the bells and whistles of most new releases, which does make me sad, because I am so intrigued about what the original TV pilot was like, what changed, behind the scenes stuff, etc.  But I can live.  I do wish that the DVD did have chapter search - once I accidentally clicked the remote and it returned me back to the menu, where I had to manually search through the disk.  I can understand Lynch's opinion that the movie should be experienced in total, yet now, as a freaky fan,  I wish I had the opportunity to revisit individual scenes.<br />Either way - I bought this on a leap of faith and am ever appreciative for the experience of Mulholland Dr.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|If you saw the movie in theatres, you haven't seen the movie.  I recommend first time viewers watch the director's cut &quot;Untitled&quot; without the subtitles first, then watch it with them turned on.  The running commentary enhances the movie. This movie gave me a better understanding of the music scene in the early 70s. I was only five years old in 1973, so to quote Lester Bangs, I &quot;missed rock and roll&quot;. One of the added features, Cameron Crowe's original articles that appeared in Rolling Stone, gives more background to the music of that era.  Also, don't miss the &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; deleted scene, classic.
B000006TZ8|5.0|This started the ball rolling in a major way. They already had two albums and a few singles under their belt, but with \\"All Mod Cons\\" what followed was a string of many hits and huge popularity, along with critical admiration. Just how confident this album is, is readily illustrated by the the punk aggression and energy of the title track and \\"Billy Hunt\\", appearing with the psychedelic, reverb-soaked fade out to \\"In the Crowd\\". For the most part, this sounds like a band totally in control. The music is more shrewd than before, with Weller showing his admiration for Ray Davies' songwriting by making many of the songs character based, such as in the excellent \\"To be someone\\", a possibly self-cautionary tale about an old, faded rock star reminiscing about better times: \\"There's no more swimming in a guitar-shaped pool, no more reporters at my beck and call\\". If I have one criticism, it is that the cover of Davies' \\"David Watts\\" is a bit flat. Throughout the album, there are some remarkable lyrics from a man barely in his twenties. Of course, a great deal of this album (and the Jam's) appeal comes from the superb, intricate bass playing (and useful backing vocals) of Bruce Foxton, along with the intense, rock-solid drumming of Rick Buckler. I should point out that I am a bit too young to remember anything about the Jam, but a few listens of \\"All Mod Cons\\", and their later albums, along with a decent hits compilation (I suggest Polydor's 1997 \\"Very Best of\\"), will inform as to why this band gained so much attention, for the brief period (1977-82) of their recording career.
B000056K04|5.0|I have been a fan of The Dave Matthews Band for about 8 years now, and for good reason. These guys know how to rock! The new album is, of course, great. I have to say it is quite a bit different from their past album, but that's ok by me because it's still a work of art. My favorite song is &quot;When The World Ends&quot;. All I can say about that song is WoW! Every song is great. Truly talented band! I think these guys will be around for a long time! Buy and enjoy!
B0000060AK|5.0|This review is a bit of an addendum to the one I wrote about the McGegan Ariodante. How lucky we are to have both his and Minkowski's superb recordings, so different yet both alive with vocal and dramatic excitement.<br />I've mentioned that I choose McGegan over Minkowski and it is for a number of reasons. That said, I feel that both are really excellent and either is a good choice. My main reservation about this set concerns the conducting. The tempos are all so extreme - on the one hand, Scherza Infida is so slow as to almost cripple poor von Otter (she's a good enough artist to get through - but it's a real challenge for the listener). Then on the other hand, much of the dance music and many of the arias (poor Veronica Cangemi in Dalinda's Act 1 number!) is taken at very, very high speed. The sound made by the Musiciens du Louvre is vibrant and alive but lacks the refinement and beauty of McGegan's orchestra. Minkowski is liberal - sometimes to a fault - with ornaments, and I feel that occasionally less would be so much more.<br />Fewer reservations about the singing. Von Otter is a wonderful hero, full and radiant of voice, rock-solid and exciting of technique. If she made just a little more of the words she would be the Ariodante of our time. Dawson's Ginevra has been highly praised here and elsewhere and whilst she sings most beautifully and with bags of feeling, I (heretic that I am!) find her range of vocal colour just a bit limited. Cangemi's voice is accurate but thin, whilst thin is never a term that could be applied to Podles' mighty contralto. She's not a subtle singing actress, but the sheer power and security of her singing is what impresses. Croft is certainly an improvement on his Harmonia Mundi counterpart.<br />A very, very good recording that for me isn't quite the equal of its main rival, but certainly wouldn't disappoint any Handel lover. Five stars, and no mistake.

B0000636UN|4.0|Like No Doubt, I have been an off and on again fan of Sheryl Crow's music. I got pretty tired of her music after hearing the singles off \\"Tuesday Night Music Club\\" and \\"Sheryl Crow\\" on the radio one too many times. I wasn't even going to get \\"The Globe Sessions\\" but \\"My Favorite Mistake\\" grew on me so much that I had to buy it. I absolutely loved that album to pieces and that made me reconnect with Sheryl Crow as an artist. So news of her new album was going to come out this month, I immediately planned on buying it as soon as possible.<br />After listening to \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" a couple of times, I will have to admit that \\"The Globe Sessions\\" is slightly better than \\"C'mon, C'mon\\". Nevertheless I still enjoyed \\"C'mon, C'mon\\". I wasn't too particularly crazy about \\"Steve McQueen\\". That song hasn't really sunk in with me yet, maybe it will, maybe it won't. I love the first single off the album \\"Soak Up the Sun\\". It will definitely be a fun song to listen to over the summer. One of my personal favorite tracks off the album is \\"Diamond Road\\". I just love the lyrics to the song (as well as the catchy hooks), especially when Sheryl sings \\"When you're lonely (you're not alone).\\" I don't know why but that line just resonates with me. The songs that Stevie Nicks and Don Henley contributed vocals on were fabulous too. Sheryl once agains puts out a solid rock album that is fun listen to, especially a fun summer album.
B00003CY6M|2.0|I give it two stars for trying hard. Eugene Levy and John Corbett make for nice scene stealers, and there are a few laugh-out-loud funnies that happen along the way. It's a \\"cute\\" movie, a decent date movie at best.<br />But the plot? Oh, please. Predictable, boring, and mildly disturbing. At one point I turned to my wife and muttered \\"Oh look, they're cheating on their fiancees, isn't it wonderful?\\"<br />I had a valid point, too. Underneath the \\"cutsyness\\" of this movie lays some pretty dark stuff. We as the audience are encouraged to forget about all of the infidelities and straight-out stalking John Cusak does because he's looking for his \\"soulmate.\\" And his current relationship isn't even that bad!!! Yet he pushes on with the encouragement of his best man (Jeremy Piven) as the movie glosses over the fact that he is destroying a perfectly good relationship.<br />A few factual goof-ups knock this movie down another notch. Most notable is when Kate Breckensale realizes she has mistakenly taken her friend's wallet once she has boarded a plane. So tell me just how she was able to get on the plane without showing her identification?!? It's a glaring omission in reality.<br />One final critique: The characters seem to suffer from that annoying \\"Saved By The Bell\\" phenomenon. You know, where Zak, Kelly, Slater and the gang (I'm taking you on a ride to 1991, sorry) could sort things out with one simple explanation, but instead always decide to take the roundabout way through webs of lies and over-the-top schemes? That's what this movie feels like. The two star-crossed lovers have ample opportunities to make it a simple 'yes' or 'no', instead I felt like I got the runaround.<br />Hey, take it for what it's worth. It's not a terrible movie, but I can't help feeling it was botched somewhat. The idea exceeded the execution, if you will.

B00003CXI0|5.0|Everybody should see this move!!! I absolutly loved it !!!!!! I know now this is the best move ever! I am getting it as soon as it comes out! I am always reading the Harry Potter books. When I saw the adventures of Harry Potter come to life It blew me away! I waited for it to come out on theatures and it seemed for a very, very, very long time. It felt like I was a person in in Harry Potter's adventure! It was terrific! Daniel is a good actor!!!!
6305358613|3.0|In and of itself, as a movie, this film is superb. However, it bears little resemblance to what we know from history. There were three major aspects that struck me most: Firstly, the time frame in which the events of the movie took place. Usually tweaking in this department is permissable in film, but the script squashes together what happened over 30 years into what happened within Elizabeth's twenties. The overall effect is rather damaging to historical merit. Secondly, the portayal of Elizabeth is way off, particularly in how she viewed her rise to power. She was not naive and afraid of her power when she took the throne, but a hardened politician who KNEW her power, and how to use it. She was an extremely intelligent woman, who was fluent in many languages and who had extensive classical learning. And thirdly, her relationship with Robert is rather altered in a major way...she NEVER slept with him, she was a true virgin. There are little things too, like the dress, and the way the French prince conducted himself in front of the queen...that kind of behavior would have NEVER taken place. This can be researched indepth online or through books on the subject, such as Elizabethian biographies.<br />Usually a lack of accuracy will give me distaste for a film. However, as a movie, Elizabeth is too good. Dark, chilling, and at times rather terrifying, it is a pleasure to the senses and a joy for those who like their minds provoked.
1573301183|5.0|This is, by far, the best Unplugged concert ever. This is a must have for every rock music fan. Layne Staley, Jerry Cantrell, and the other guys give an amazing performance that is, in my opinion, the best they've ever given.
B000002U82|5.0|Imagine yourself wandering through a wonderous place, and then crashing only to be swept away again.  Im sure you have if you've checked out this extraordinary sequence of tracks.  Pink Floyd takes us on an unforgettable journey through time, space, and controversey on what they decided to call &quot;Dark Side of the Moon.&quot;  <BR>If you are checking out Floyd for the first time, this would be a great place to begin as it is a defining rock experience.<BR>If you've listened to this album and felt a little unsatisfied, listen to it again and listen to it all at once.  Roger Waters, who designed this album and several other albums as a theme, intended this to be one continuous endeavor.  Please check it out for your own sake.
B000063TNH|4.0|Okay, when I bought the original Traffic DVD upon its release I was disappointed by the lack of extras.  Good transfer, clean picture, excellent sound, but practically no bonus material.  Still, a great movie IMO.  Benicio Del Toro was brilliant (and in my mind the most sympathetic character in the film).  Topher Grace (\\"That 70's Show), Don Cheadle, and Erika Christensen were also excellent... Oh yeah, Traffic, good movie.  :)
0440234743|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have ever read!!!  If you like John Grisham, then this book definelty shows him at his best.  This book is one to read again and again.
B0000640VO|5.0|Just Excellent!! This movie is so good that it should had won an Oscar! Amelie is one of a kind! If you're looking for a movie with a profound message, with comedy, with drama and lot of creative scenes, this is the one.
0671688782|5.0|I am 13 years old and in November of 2000 my family and I went to an intensive as a last resort. I was very unconnected and not bonded at all with my mom and dad. Before the intensive, I always had a bad attitude and I argued all the time. If my mom told me to do something, I would do just the opposite. I was adopted in August of '97 and I didn't even want to call my parents mom and dad.I didn't even want to be adopted at all. I was only eight so I didn't have a choice. My brother was fourteen so he could choose and he chose not to be adopted. I was mad that I had to be adopted. I have had 4 different foster families and almost all of them sent my brother and I away because of me and the way I acted. One family even wanted to keep my brother but not me. Even though I haven't read the book, I have been through the therapy and I know it can change lives. It has certainly changed my life. Now I love calling my parents mom and dad.I love having parents that I know will love me know matter what and will never send me away. I never wanted to love any of the foster parents I had because I was afraid if I loved them, they would just send me away and break my heart. My parents and I are very close and have a very good relationship. My parents and I talk all the time, not like most teens and parents. Before the intesive, I was always mean to the very few \\"friends\\" that I had. Now, I have a lot of friends. I am popular at my church and a lot of people like me. Before the intensive, I hated being homeschooled, now I dont mind it at all. I like getting to spend all day with my mom. I highly recommend this therapy. It will change your life.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I am so relieved that the best movie of last year was an indie flick. I do my best to be a snobby arthouse lover, but most years the indie world lets me down, and Im forced to concede that Hollywood made the best titles yet again. Not so in 2001. Waking Life was by a long shot the very best picture that came out last year. Its beauty, its subtlety, and its overwhelming brilliance placed it far above even the good big-budgets like LOTR. This was the film for the thinking man in 2001, and actually, come to think about it, for the last several years. My faith in independent movies has been revived.
6301095014|1.0|I really do love Rambo, America's archetypal outcast warrior!  I've watched \\"First Blood\\" 1 and 2 probably a hundred times.  But I hated \\"Rambo lll\\" right from the start.  Its Wahabbist propaganda was merely ignorant back then, but in the wake of 11-September, utterly appalling now.  It's impossible to watch the film without gasping in disbelief at the political lunacy of those days.  Still, our tormented hero might be forgiven his misplaced zeal.  Obviously Troutman never showed him any photos of 19-year-old Soviet conscripts dismembered and skinned alive, or of Afghan civilians murdered by the mostly foreign mujahedin who would eventually comprise the ruling Taliban.  There aren't any female characters in the film.  Even so, Rambo couldn't have foreseen that Afghan women under Wahabbist oppression would soon come to call themselves the \\"living dead\\".  Particularly bizarre now is the scene in which Rambo gives a child-guerrilla his Buddha necklace.  Ignore the fact that a devout Muslim would neither want nor wear an infidel image.  And forget that the casually discarded pendent was Rambo's only memento of the brave Vietnamese girl who had died saving his life in \\"First Blood ll\\".  Only remember for a moment the Bamiyam Buddhas, priceless ancient treasures blasted to smithereens by Taliban decree.  Thanks to real-life Troutmans and the CIA, plentiful US funds, weapons, and training turned Afghanistan into Soviet Vietnam and propelled the rise of a certain young Saudi exile from mujahedin commando to terrorist mastermind.  Meanwhile, real-life American Vietnam vets and their Soviet \\"afgantsi\\" counterparts have established international support groups.  In the final irony, America now seeks Russian advice in combatting Rambo's erstwhile allies.  This film's single star is justified only by its exploitation of Stallone's fabulous physique.  Rumor has it Sly is considering reprising his famous heroic role.  I hope so!  Maybe the aging but always awesome Rambo, outragedby his former friends' fiendishness, will return to the caves of Afghanistan to kick some Al-Quaida butt!  It could be called \\"First Blood lV: Rambo's Redemption\\".
B00005YXZH|5.0|...that Wilco stuck to their artistic guns, weathered the storm of key members leaving and withstood an astonishing array of cut-throat tactics from their greed-house record label Reprise.<br />But the corporate suits have lost the battle. The waiting is over - though thanks to band generosity and file swapping, many of us have had months to digest this masterwork.<br />Yankee Hotel Foxtrot demands that you accept it on its own terms, at its own leisurely yet unrelenting pace. It is both challenging and rewarding... epic yet intimate... the staggering stylistic range of Being There meets the power-pop brilliance of Summerteeth. Or for those unfortunate souls who are new to Wilco, imagine all four Beatles were still alive and together making great records to sit alongside the White Album and Revolver.<br />Imagine no more.<br />On Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, tightly constructed pop tunes sit side by side with loosely assembled noise-melody suites. Unlike, say, on Radiohead's recent efforts, noise here is not an annoying distraction -- but an organic component as important and evocative as any other instrument.<br />Meanwhile, Jeff Tweedy is no hurry to make you realize he is the most important songwriter of the past 20 years - he lets you draw that conclusion on your own after months of dissecting his stream-of-consciousness lyrics, his soul-baring confessions, his eerie ability to predict September 11th with such clarity in songs like 'Jesus, Etc.' and 'Ashes of American Flags.' <br />But Tweedy has long been so in touch with the hope, grief, bitterness and renewed promise of America that maybe this isn't such a shock after all.<br />What is truly shocking is that any record executive would question the artistic merit or commercial potential of this album.
B00003W8NM|5.0|this is the best movie that i've ever seen.  it is funny, exciting, and interesting.  i could watch this movie over and over again, it gets better every time.  buy it, whether it looks good or not.
B00005JLD2|5.0|I was fortunate to see this movie while visiting Sydney, Australia in February. Having heard about the stolen generation, I was ignorant of the policies established concerning the legal abduction of Aboriginal children from their families until I saw this film based on a true story.<br />I was expecting a documentary-like, low-budget film. Instead, I found myself captivated on so many levels by a film that was not only well written, but well produced, directed, and acted. I was shocked to find out that this practice was legal until 1970. More importantly, I was amazed and inspired by the determination of Molly, Daisy, and Gracie as they journeyed 1,600 km to return home.<br />I am presently reading \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" written by Molly's daughter Doris Pilkington (Nugi Garimara). I can't wait to see the movie again!
B0000636UN|5.0|I haven't been a fan of Sheryl Crow in the past, but this CD is really good.  I like the whole thing.  It's good, old fashioned Rock and Roll with a modern twist.  Buy this CD today, you will not be disappointed.
B000059HB7|5.0|If you are reading this review, you probably already saw this film. This happens to be my favorite John Wayne film, and I had the VHS a while ago (it got eaten by my VCR....thank goodness for DVD!!!).<br />In case anyone has not seen it, Dean Martin as his sidekick is excellent. There are several very funny scenes, as well as great drama. The acting is also very good.<br />The best thing about the DVD is the transfer. It is excellent, and much cleaner than the VHS. If you like this film, you MUST have it on DVD. If you like John Wayne and have not seen this one, I think you will enjoy it. It is a great film for the first the person who likes westerns.<br />Peace,<br />Morley
0345448898|2.0|The first two books were very written, spetacularly written in fact.  The description and plot was incredible and the characters were likable.  I finally got my hands on the third one, and I was very disappointed.  He managed to tie up all the loose ends and the plot, but in my opinion it was a terrible way to end the book, and the whole idea that \\"Christianity is nothing but a very powerful and convincing lie\\" was very insulting to me.
B00005YW4H|4.0|\\"Come Away With Me\\" proves that you don't need a hell of a voice like Aretha or Billie Holiday to record a wonderful cd. First of all, this record wins because of the strong selection of jazz, blues and country songs. Second, Norah Jones has a sweet, honey voice that has'nt the power of Bonnie Raitt or the fire of Janis Joplin but hits you like the breaze of a early spring day.
B00005YXZH|4.0|There are few American musicians these days who are constantly willing to put their reputation on the line by creating adventurous and challenging music.  Jeff Tweedy and his mates from Wilco are the exception.<br />For all the detractors in the recording industry, Wilco has created a wonderful piece of post-modern Americana.<br />Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is one of those albums where every listening produces new feelings and nuances for the listener. Kamera, Pot Kettle Black, Jesus,etc. Heavy Metal Drummer are enjoyable tunes with engaging rhythms that won't disappoint.  But the tone of the album is best epitomized by the signature song of the album. Ashes of American Flags is a haunting lyric and melody in the spirit of Woody Guthrie.  Although recorded a year ago, the song portrays a sentiment that many will relate to today.<br />I say, show the recording execs at Reprise they were wrong about Wilco and buy this record.  You won't be disappointed.
1573301183|5.0|Another talented life cut short...too short. Troubled, and tormented. Obviously lonely and depressed. What a terrible shame.<br />This DVD is the best music DVD I own. The quality is first rate and the audio the best mix I've heard to date.<br />Don't miss this \\"collectible\\" quality performance by the now late Staley and his talented band members and friends.
B000003TA4|5.0|There have been some VERY good CD's out there. Aerosmith had some great cd's and songs, we had the hairbands with Guns N Roses Appetite for Destruction, we had Queen's CD's, we had Motley Cru, Ozzy Osbourne had some great Cd's, but the best CD, I think, in the world is Nirvana's Nevermind. There is not one bad song on this album. Believe me, this is not for those mainstream listeners though. Even though nirvana went mainstream, mainstream bands are popular for one or two songs or their looks. Nirvana was popular for ALL of their cd's. <br />Kurt Cobain, the headman, singer, and song writer of the band, had some of the most inspirational work ever made into music. His lyrics are incredible, even though some of them are sickening (Milk It and serve the servants on In Utero), and some of them don't make sense (Smells Like Teen Spirit especially, but no Nirvana song makes sense), they were still great. People who don't agree with me or like Nirvana's work obviously are 50 years old and listening to jazz or oprah. <br />BUY THIS CD IT IS EXCELENT AND YOU WILL HAVE NO REGRETS!! ANYONE WHO DOESN'T OWN THIS ALBUM IS WIERD!!! EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE IT WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE GRUNGE OR ALTERNATIVE FANS!!!
B000001ELF|5.0|When Ace put this album out, He put out the song \\"New York Groove\\", on a single which made Billboard's Top 40 list making it into the top 10. On this album, or should I say CD, Ace unleases his true artistic abilities, which by the way, is at a Masters level. This album is Rock and Roll. It is not, and thank the Lord God, it is not filled with slow depressing romantic crap. Most of the songs on the album were written by Ace, except for New York Groove, which was written by Russ Ballard.  Rip It Out, which is good solid rhythm rock and roll, was written by Ace, along with Larry Kelly and Sue Kelly. Speedin Back To My Baby was written by Ace and Jeanette Frehley, and Wiped-Out was written by Ace and Anton Fig, which as you know, Anton went on to play the drums for Vinnie Vincent and finally ended up as the regular drummer on the David Letterman Show. Folks, this is good Rock and Roll. This is not really what you would call heavy metal, but then again it's not mainstream pop rock either. The songs have a good beat, and a good rhythm to them. Of the four solos, Ace's was the most successful. I own it, and I love it.
1572522089|5.0|This is one of the most awesome and visionary films ever made.  Few films can be compared to it.  If a person only sees one Kurosawa film in his/her lifetime, or just one foriegn movie in general, it should be none other than 'Ran'. It begins with warriors on horseback, watching the endless terrain for intruders. Haunting music plays in background, and one knows they are in for something special. An epic in every sense of the word, 'Ran' is the story of a Lord dividing his territory between his three sons. Ignoring the warning of his youngest son, Saburo, the Lord exiles him. Before he realizes what he has done, his oldest son turns against his father. What happens next will be nothing but chaos, just as the title suggests. 'Ran' has some of the most beautiful battle sequences ever filmed. One would think that watching dozens of being brutally slaughtered couldn't be beautiful, but one has to see this movie to believe it. 'Ran' has also one of the most mischievous female characters created, Lady Kaede. The story is based on King Lear, but I'm willing to bet Kurosawa got the inspiration of Lady Kaede from Lady Macbeth. This woman will do anything and everything to have her way; putting on a false face and tears, sleep with her husband's brother, and order the death of an innocent woman. In the end, things get very bloody and a little confusing, but the final scene suggests a cry to help humanity.
B00005JKL8|4.0|About the movie:<BR>This is a hollywood style action flick, meaning unrealistic. If you like patriotic action movies, you should enjoy this. I really like the movie, but the exagerrated nature of many scenes bothered me.  Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson give decent performances.   <br />About the DVD extras:<BR>The amount of extras disapointed me. There were supposedly approximately 8 extended or deleted scenes. The amount of new material between all of them probably amounted to around 2 minutes. Most of the \\"extra\\" scenes were actually in the movie, but they call it extra because small parts were cut out to get the movie an R rating. <br />Conclusion:<BR>Although I recommend this film for anyone looking for a military action flick, I would not recommend buying the DVD. There are few, if any, worthwhile extras on the DVD and the movie is not one I would want to repeatedly watch.
B00005RY7X|5.0|To everyone who is trashing this album, let it go!!! This is not meant to be a serious album with songs full of meaning or anything like that. This is an album with songs that are catchy (to the point of annoying at times), with lyrics about partying and other inane subject matter. It is meant to be fun!! I put this in my player at one of my friend's reccomendations and it was great. It's a fun album, it's not the next big thing, or anything like that. It's a return to when metal was actually something more than whining about how your life [stinks] and all the other incredibly worthless topics that today's metal bands talk about. I was a huge metal fan in the 80's and I moved away from it because, frankly, it became [junk]. There was nothing worthhwhile left. Now, this isn't the greatest album ever or even close, but it's fun!!!! Leave it at that.
B000002NHN|4.0|With the recent purchase of this CD....I now have her entire collection. I have found this CD to be much different from her earlier works with more repetition and more of a African/Desert/Middle East flavor to its rhythm. There are some excellent songs on this CD Skellig/Caucasus/Dantes Prayer/Mumurs, however, Loreena does not even come close to using her incredible voice on this CD. In contrast, the Visit has much more a Celtic flavor ( takes you away many years ago to the shores of Ireland) and has very powerful vocals that will pierce your heart and soul...( Bonny Portmore, Lady of Shalott, Courtyard Lullaby, Old Ways). In fact, I will go out on a limb and say that from hearing her vocals on The Visit, that she has probably one of the most unique, beautiful and powerful voices I have ever heard. The Visit in my opinion is her best work.

B00005YW4H|5.0|It amazes me that in this day and age boring cliche artists such as Alicia Keys and Britney Spears get all the fame and glory while real artists like this young lady get no love at all.  Why are people so fickle with music.  What happen to music that makes people's whole body react to it?  Well this album makes you move if you just listen to it.  This is the best new album from a young artist in years.  Put down your John Mayer nothing to say album and pick this one up.  It's for your own good.  Best album since Prince's Rainbow Children.  Again another amazing record sittin on shelves.
B00005NB8J|5.0|the movie stargate was a very good film. full of action and suspence. the acting was good and all the stunts. the movie starts out where the recrute spader and russell. then jackson (spader) finds the translations and tells the military what it means and how they can use it. o'neil (russell) is keeping stuff from jackson and in the end they end up going through the gate. they find when they get there, there is life on other plants and that our way of life was created by an allien called ra. ra controls everything in all different univeres expect earth because there was an up rising. o'neil and jackson help the people of abydos to rebel against ra. they do that and the crew leaves but jackson stays behind to learn more about the culture and while there he got married to a native woman. this movie is good for people who like sci-fi and action with a little bit of romance (but not much) i strongly recamend this film.

0671024256|4.0|King's *On Writing* consists of 3 separate books that King himself appears to recognize are not integrated into a unified whole.  First he gives us his condensed life story, focusing on his work as a writer from his childhood through the success of *Carrie.*  Second he outlines what he considers to be the rudiments of good writing and how he goes about creating a story.  Third he describes in detail the recent accident in which, while taking his daily walk on a country road in Maine, he was almost killed by a reckless driver.  Although I have never been a King fan (quite the opposite, in fact), I found this volume to be diverting and surprisingly instructive.  In particular, his explanation of his &quot;situational&quot; technique of building a story (as opposed to the more structured technique of working from a plot outline, which King finds distasteful) was fascinating.  His methods have clearly succeeded for him.  One disappointment in *On Writing* was that, while he states early on that he wants to talk about &quot;the language,&quot; he actually says little about his use of language, aside from advice about cutting fluff that can be found in any number of writing manuals.  I wish he had delved into the significance (as he sees it) of his voice, combining as it does standard usage with post-60s crudity and a hint of blue-collar defensiveness.
6302968143|5.0|BOO knows what spooks and scares Halloween night has in store for Salem, Massachusetts, in the year 1993. <br />It is 300 years after the notorious hanging of the Sanderson Sisters, three witches doomed to spend an eternity in darkness unless a virgin lights the Black Flame candle. A sceptic 'new kid on the block', Max Dennison (Omri Katz), flanked by a classmate Allison (Vinessa Shaw) and his younger sibling Dani Dennison (Thora Birch), in an audacious act, lights the candle and revives the Sanderson Sisters. <BR>Guided by an enchanted black cat Thakary Binx, the struggle is on as they embark on a journey to prevent the witches from gaining immortality until sunrise.<br />A marvellous masterpiece by Kenny Ortega, 'Hocus Pocus' is jocular, fast-paced and frivolous, with plenty of sorcery and witchcraft to entertain a multitude of viewers, any audience, at any time. With superb antics and endearing, humorous themes, 'Hocus Pocus' is guaranteed to enchant its audience into a fantastical world, with the added bonus of 'dead man's toes' and 'rat tails', to ultimately cast its spell and make even the most sceptic viewer believe in the hocus pocus of Halloween night.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|What's good about this movie:<BR>Amazing sets and costumes<BR>Nicole Kidman in a corset,<BR>Some funny moments (esp.\\"Like a Virgin). <BR>A sustained sense of visual invention, <BR>A few good performances,<BR>The evocation(if somewhat hyperwrought) of Lautrec's Paris.<BR>The illusion that Kidman and MacGregor can really sing.<BR>Some arresting dance sequences.<br />What's not good about this movie: <BR>Maddenlingy  fast editing in the first 30 minutes that make it absolutely impossible to focus on anything esp. the dance sequences. <BR>An unbelievably trite and inept story; i.e. Kidman's character learns that she's dying and instead of going off to spend her final days with her lover, she tells him she doesn't love him and goes off with the Duke instead!? <BR>The fact that modern studio technology cannot yet cover Kidman and MacGregor's glaring vocal flaws i.e. Kidman sings out of tune at times while MacGregor's high notes often sound forced and ugly.<BR>The pervading sense of wretched excess-i.e. you feel sensorily assaulted at most times and instead of being stimulated, you ultimately just feel numb. <BR>A disturbing aura of contrivance that  pervades every production aspect. You feel that the director is trying to compensate the lack of real heart or originality  with eye candy and overblown orchestrations.<BR>MacGregor's accent that veers queasily between the US and Scotland.<BR>One of the worst pieces of music ever to mar a closing credit sequence.<BR>The inescapeable feeling that you just wasted two hours of your life to witness Baz Luhrmann's ego trip.<br />Not really recommended.
B000065U1N|4.0|Josh Harnett's other war movie recently released was Ridley Scott directed motion picture \\"Black Hawk Down\\". The movie is about the US Delta Forces and US Rangers mission to capture some lieutenants from the band of Muhammad Farrah Aidid. During the movie, different things happen and turn a perfect mission into a perfect disaster. The movie is packed with lots of characters and lots of sad and funny moments, great sound and awesome visual effects. All this together makes the EXCELLENT movie called \\"Black Hawk Down\\". Two thumbs up for the movie!!! Excellent work Ridley Scott!!<br />ALSO!!! if you loved \\"Black Hawk Down\\", don't forget to check out the Musical Score, written, composed and directed by Hans Zimmer, the genious behind the \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and \\"Gladiator\\" soundtracks and musical scores!
B00005RYL9|3.0|I will not bore you with another review of the movie. But I will slam this attempt to make you part with more money. No extra insight into the making of, reasons behind or lost scenes. The second disk is a standard CD with the three main Queen songs. But the first is what is lacking the extras. It has the usual cast bios, trailers, posters and stills. But not much else that would make it worth the extra money. As for the Dolby Digital 5.1 - the music tracks come out real great but the rest of the soundtrack seems to come from only the center speaker. Save money and buy the first DVD and the musical soundtrack.

B00005V3Z4|4.0|Richard Kelly's remarkably assured directorial debut, \\"Donnie Darko\\", could be earmarked as the teen movie version of Paul Thomas Anderson's \\"Magnolia\\" with a surreal sci-fi edge. Unfortunately, despite having the likes of Drew Barrymore, Mary McDonnell, Katharine Ross, Noah Wyle and Patrick Swayze in a to-die-for ensemble cast and probably the best poster of 2001 (not to mention a seriously deranged web-site), it fell by the wayside at the box office. Many blame its sort-of unintentional mirroring of September 11 for its lack of drawing power; others claim a misleading ad campaign was to blame (ignore the \\"classic psychological thriller\\" plaudit on the DVD sleeve); many found its similarities to Sam Mendes' \\"American Beauty\\" and the aforementioned \\"Magnolia\\" too much to stand. However, there is still a lot of enjoyment to be had with watching \\"Donnie\\", thanks in large part to an admirably tender tone often missing in today's movies.<br />Kelly's script, unfortunately, does bear quite a few likenesses to Paul Thomas Anderson's three-hour opus, not least in Donnie and his psychologist, Dr. Thurman's, discussions about God, an unerringly supernatural ring to all of the preceedings and Swayze's role as a motivational speaker with some rather humiliating dark secrets (and, unfortunately, Swayze doesn't match Tom Cruise's Frank TJ Mackey for audience enrapturement). That said, \\"Donnie\\" trades in some David Lynch-style moments to keep the audience happy, not least in Donnie's eerie messanger, Frank, the six-foot-tall bunny rabbit. And Kelly's direction is a lot less harsh on his protagonists than Anderson's was, giving the film a more involving emotional centre than Anderson's polarising epic.<br />Though it doesn't match \\"Magnolia's\\" scale budget-wise, Kelly belies the film's average budget ($5 million) much like Darren Aronofsky did with \\"Requiem For A Dream\\". The film is effortlessly secured in the '80s with a very decent pop soundtrack (though lack of money preventedthe filmmakers from releasing a 'various artists' soundtrack) and is very well shot by director of photography Steven Poster (particularly highlighted in Donnie's scenes with Frank in his bathroom). Kelly also manages to worm in some decent digital effects, from the \\"Abyss\\"-style 'time spears' to the apocalyptic sky effects.<br />And, having gained a hell of a cast for his first feature, Kelly duly delivers on the acting front also, particularly in his lead Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal epitomises the film's sweet, moral centre as well as the thick paranoia set throughout, and emerges alongside \\"Ghost World's\\" Thora Birch's Enid as 2001's most beguiling teen hero. He is ably supported by the rest of the ensemble, particularly Beth Grant as gym teacher Kitty Farmer, Jena Malone as his girlfriend Gretchen and, especially, Mary McDonnell and Holmes Osborne as his worried parents. The character Cherita Chen, however, stole my heart shamelessly.<br />A lot's been made about \\"Donnie's\\" juggling of genres, switching quite quickly from domestic drama to black comedy to teen romance to apocalyptic sci-fi in leaps and bounds. There is no denying, though, that Kelly is a talent to watch in the future, considering the remarkable debut he's made here. The DVD, meanwhile, is crammed full of supplemental material, including two audio commentaries (one of which done by the producers and near enough the whole cast) and extensive deleted scenes featuring more substantial acting work, particularly from Drew Barrymore and Holmes Osborne.

B000022TSY|5.0|Dennis Hopper should've gotten the golden palm for this movie, make that picture (he did win for best new filmmaker, but he deserved the bigger prize too), that give sweeping cinematography, a superb soundtrack, acting believable: alternately funny and tragic, and a feel that is all it's own (and those that ripped it off aren't any better).<br />Here, Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper play two small time motorcycle guys from L.A. (LA? yes, Los Angeles) who go to a La Contenta bar, whether it is really in Mexico or not you be the judge, and buy a good deal of coke from a dealer.  They sell it to a guy right next to an airport and then starts the triumphant tunes The Pusher and Born to Be Wild by Steppenwolf as they go on the road with a load of money in Fonda's gastank.  On the road, they run into an understanding farmer, a quirky commune leader, a commune with some really strange folks (reminds me why I occasionaly indulge in the cannibus culture but not communism), two nice girls posing as skinny dippers, a parade, an ACLU attorney who says \\"Lord have mercy, is that what that is?\\" when Fonda passes a joint, witty and deadly southern folk and estranged prostitutes.<br />Fonda and Hopper represented something amazing to the generation that they were about, and that's what made the box office bucks; that and Jack Nicholson in one of his abloslute most memorable roles as the drunkard ACLU attorney George Hanson. Must See, if only once, for anyone.
B0000636UN|5.0|This is Sheryl's 4th studio album and it's wonderful. It's a rockin' CD, with a few slow songs which creates the perfect mix. Every song on the CD is good. It's not the type of Cd that I skip around. I want to listen to the WHOLE thing. <BR>Some differences that I found in this album vs. her other ones are that it's more happy. The songs are more on a positive side (the majority anyway). It also has a bit more production which many like and some don't.<BR>My favorite song is &quot;Weather Channel&quot;. It's so pretty yet haunting at the same time. It's acoustic and is just Sheryl and her guitar. It's great because it's at the end and I just think it was a great way to end the album.<BR>It's just an all around great CD and I will definitely continue to be a devoted Sheryl Crow fan.
6302732875|5.0|I had a dream once:  Felix Unger, Michael Corleone, Jackson Pollock (or was it John Glenn?), and John Yossarian were having dinner.  They talked in clipped, staccato, very stylish tones, swearing constantly while oozing testosterone.  Jack Ryan (I) was the maitre d', and Verbal Kint was the waiter.  Sam Lowry dropped by for a drink once the meal was over.  It was fascinating and thought-provoking, the very best of men being men, in a John Wayne not an Iron John sense.  And when I woke up, I wanted to watch some more.<br />'Twas a desire easily remedied.  I took an hour and forty minutes of David Mamet's \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\".<br />And what does one find there?  A symphony of things we don't see, but that have terrible power over the characters: \\"downtown\\", Mitch & Murray, Shelly's daughter, Jerry Graf, and of course, the prized Glengarry leads.  I can't remember a film with a more impressive array of memorable MacGuffins (Mamet is a fan of this particular Hitchcockian technique; see his \\"The Spanish Prisoner\\" for more).  None of these items are essential to the plot, except that they exist for the sole purpose of tormenting the salesmen.  And who do we have playing said salesmen?  Arguably the greatest collection of male actors in the last quarter century.  All, without exception, are at the top of their respective games, delivering Mamet's trademark rat-a-tat dialogue with verve and style to spare.<br />Jack Lemmon is, to me, the best of the best here.  I don't usually warm to Lemmon's schlubby shtick, but here he is imminently watchable while being terribly sad.  His voice is the key to the performance, as it works back and forth between dulcet salesman tones and a deeply pathetic timbre.  Lemmon was 68 when this movie was made, almost ten year older than anyone else in the cast.  But I'd put his energy and bravado up against any of them.  Even against Al Pacino, who scenery chews here like only Pacino can.  Except it's not the over-the-top mugging that I found sodistasteful in \\"Any Given Sunday\\" or \\"Scent of a Woman\\".  On the other hand, it not the awe-inspiring quiet work of \\"The Godfather\\" or \\"Donnie Brasco\\".  Instead, Pacino gives the audience a controlled charismatic animal found somewhere in between.  Ed Harris, who usually portrays strong and in-control leaders, here plays a man trying to appear strong and in-control.  But his David Moss is just a whiny little boy at heart, and Harris shows Moss' quick temper and immaturity well, while also showing his wicked mind.  Alan Arkin's character is, of the four main salesmen, the biggest loser.  And Arkin brings the pathos forward with such an easy, subtle style, you'd be hard-pressed to catch him working.  Alec Baldwin, whom I've never really appreciated, gets to play a very small but broad role.  He digs his teeth into it and never lets go.  He's only on screen for a couple of minutes near the beginning, but he casts a heavy pall over the rest of the film.  And Kevin Spacey, who's done increasingly banal work as he's become more famous, was an unknown at the time.  Thrown in to the pit with these heavyweights, and given the most thankless role in the film, he scores on all counts.  You'll find yourself hating his character, a by-the-book office manager, but you'll sure appreciate Spacey's work in the role.  And lastly, Jonathan Pryce is heartbreaking as a prospective client of Pacino's character.  He doesn't talk throughout the movie's first half, but when he comes back and opens his mouth, he's heartbreakingly pitiable<br />Like Pryce's character, whenever anyone else who doesn't work in the office speaks (Mr. Spannel, the cop) Mamet abandons his trademark rhythms for a more realistic sound.  This produces a startling effect, in that it widens the gap between the artificial world of the salesmen and the real world.  Director James Foley furthers this rhetorical device with his visual choices.  See the faux-reality of the first shot, in the Chinese restaurant's phone booth, which is marked by a harsh red backdrop, fierce lighting and deep shadows.  This tone is maintained, if not visually then at least in a myriad of other ways, when the boys get back to the office.  Seemingly a very cold and dry place, the office is brought alive by the action (action, that is, in conversation) that takes place there.  It becomes a purgatory on earth for some of these men; for others, it is pure hell.<br />Armed with only that knowledge that he's helmed two Mark Wahlberg films, I wondered, \\"how did James Foley get this job?\\"  But further perusal of his filmmography reveals that he's worked well with Sean Penn, Chris Walken, Gene Hackman, Aidan Quinn, and, well, Madonna (the exception that proves the rule).  He sometimes intrudes on the scene by whipping about with some overly stylish camera moves.  But more often than not he is restrained and effective with his camera, capturing, at just the right moment, the tension on the actor's faces.  Jack Lemmon has a particularly wonderful moment of anguish, shot in extreme and heartbreaking close-up.  Every line on his face speaks volumes to the camera.<br />\\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" is a film of no-action.  Between the night before and the morning after occurs a robbery that spins the story towards a gripping climax.  But we never see the robbery.  And come to think of it, we never see the resolution of the climax.  What we do see, or rather hear, is a stunning collection of speeches, dialogues, conversations, and sermons, about what it means to be a salesman in a man's world.  The conclusion: if yours aren't brass, don't bother getting up in the morning.

1573225517|5.0|High Fidelity by Nick Hornby, is not just another sappy book about relationships gone bad, but a refreshingly realistic account of relationships through the eyes of man.  Hornby's exquisite and hilarious style of writing keeps the pages turning and the reader laughing and nodding as they relate to, and gain insight on, different aspects of love and life.<BR> Nick Hornby does a spectacular job at defining each character and bringing them to life.  Rob Fleming seems to jump off the pages and speaks of his love life, or lack of at times, in such vivid detail and emotion, it's as if Rob himself is sitting in your living room recounting the confused drama that is his life.<BR> High Fidelity is a definite must read for all who have been in relationships, or are thinking of beginning one.  This novel will give you some understanding of the male point-of-view as well as the hardships, confusion, and the sometimes backwards reality that seems to get mixed up in the stereotypical notion of love.  All of which is portrayed through the hilarious and blunt writing style of one of my \\"top five favorite\\" authors, Nick Hornby.
0800130952|4.0|Roald Dahl described a thoroughly detestable school figure in &quot;Boy&quot; and repeated it in &quot;Matilda&quot;.  I don't know which he created first, but the characters are so like autocratic figures and petty functionaries that one endures when life takes a nasty turn.  We are better off for the experience, and we have to learn to laugh through the misery.  I could just see bank officials, license examiners, title company agents, claims adjusters and the like mishandling everything as they puffed their puny chests and acted their minor roles to unappreciative audiences.  It was just fitting that the DVD was flawed at the height of the dramatic action.  Matilda would have known what to do with whomever or whatever caused the flaw.
B0000640SA|4.0|The first couple of scenes I started wonder what on earth was going on. Thankfully, the more I looked the more I was intrigued. <br />This movie is about a former insurance investigater named Leonard Shelby ( played by Australian actor Guy Pearce ) who has no short-term memory since the rape and murder of his wife. The film literally starts from the end and finishes at the beginning and has you more intrigued with every scene completed. <br />In order for Shelby to remember he creates a system in which he writes down notes and has tattoos on his body which will enable him to find out what is truth and what isn't. This systematic and comprehensive approach by Shelby enables him to determine who he thinks killed and raped his wife. <br />It's a real challenge to watch this film and I felt that the script was written really well. <br />All up I give this a 4/5.
6305426651|5.0|Before I saw this movie I thought it might be another hum-dum movie.  Boy, was I wrong.  This movie was instantly with in my top three movies.  Charming, funny, and tear jerking.  A winner on all sides.
B00003CXWV|3.0|This, I felt, was a good movie but it was hard to retract from the fact that George Jung was personally responsible for selling drugs in the US which is now responsible for millions of addictions and thousands of deaths. <br />Having said all that, this was a great film to watch though it did surprise me somewhat. Basically, this movie is about a guy named George Jung who was the first american to smuggle cocaine into the US. <br />It shows his life story from humble beginnings in dope selling to the high rolling stakes of cocaine smuggling. As to the reason why this filmed surprised me ? It is because I wasnt interested in the fact that cocaine had dealt the US with a major drug problem, rather the plight of George Jung himself ( and his parents ) and what he was like. <br />At best, this movie portrayed George Jung as a humble kid who turned into a drug lord ( in which he deserved what he got ). Johnny Depp, Penelope Cruz and the two Aussie actors Cliff Curtis and Rachel Griffiths played their characters well enough for all of us to believe that George Jung was only trying to earn a living at what he did best: selling drugs.<br />Look, I did like the movie and the characters but am a tad suspicious as to how an audience is to react to a movie like this ? At the end of the day I do have to admit that this was a very good movie. Overall, Ill give it a 3.5/5
0783219598|4.0|The beginning of the film starts with narration how Babe goes to the farm and what happen to Babe before he comes. The most notable feature of this film is personification of animals. Particularly, in the conversation of animals, a mouth moves. It supposed to be used special effects. It describes realistically like peoples talking, by using the expressions changes as well. This film is based on the fairy tale, for that reason, a narrator appears and explains about the story during the film like an orally narrated fairy tale. In addition, it divides into several chapters, which is also like reading a fairy tale. And this film uses music quite appropriately, especially, when the incidents happen. For example, the music expresses the situation that makes tension or intimation. Interesting thing is the feature of animals, which are personified; they have a discipline in their own way like the human society. There is a leader who is a male sheepdog, named Rex. Like this, they are all like human. After Babe comes to the farm, it happens some chances that Babe break the rule. When he becomes a sheep-pig, he does not use his authority and threats to lamb like other sheepdogs, but he asks his favor to them politely. Finally, this film states humanity and morality. At the last happy ending scene, the bright sunlight talks this. As the whole, this seems to be like a fairy tale book, a farm, a hill and animals, all the background of this film are like one scene of the nursery story. The reason why this can be possible is the special effects. This film cannot be said except special effects, it is the most significant part of this work. For example, special effects are related to every animals movement, features, expressions, in particular, when they have a conversation, the motion of their mouth and also singing mice. In fact, this film has a simple plot that one pig, named Babe, becomes a sheepdog and wins a first prize at the sheepdog contest. However, sometimessimplicity is better than complexity like this fairy tale for adults.
B00005PJ8O|4.0|Seems like George Patton was portrayed, in the movie, as a charismatic, strong willed and an effective leader with a mouth to boot..!! I believe the light shed on him showed that he cared for the men who gave 110% for him and his country yet loathed and despised a man for his apparent weakness to fake injury or show any sign of what he called 'cowardness'.<br />Unfortunately, men like these are bound to have faults. His were apparent. All to eager to mouth-off to everyone and anyone more often than not got him into trouble. As he said, he's not there to make friends...he's there to fight..!!<br />It was a good movie showing him as a person and how he 'ticked' and it also showed his understanding of war and how it worked. His apparent \\"previous life\\" captured a sense of destiny which is something I haven't seen in a movie before. He forever seemed determined to right the wrongs of the world and was completely convinced that he was the man to do it. His almost obsessive nature on the history of previous wars played a major part, for<BR>his role, in the film.<br />On the German side there showed some lieutenants of the Fuehrer ( pardon all the spelling ) continuously going over past wars attempting to second guess Patton and kill both the British and Americans. I am intrigued as to whether this is a known fact of for purely 'motion picture' reasons ?<br />I will admit I didn't think the movie was all that good but I guess it wasn't a movie about war, rather a movie about the character of George Patton and his own battle within a war and how he himself overcame it with the help of his own troops.<br />Overall, an excellent portrait of George Patton. 4/5 from me.
6305181810|5.0|John Grisham's \\"The Rainmaker\\" is a film that is nothing short of astonishing or powerful. This is director Francis Ford Coppola's best film since \\"Apocalypse Now\\" and \\"The Godfather\\" series. And to me, \\"The Rainmaker\\" is more of a powerful drama than it is a thinking person's film alongside the other Grisham adaptions: \\"The Firm\\", \\"The Pelican Brief\\", \\"The Client\\", \\"A Time to Kill\\", and \\"The Chamber\\". \\"The Rainmaker\\" focuses on a Memphis law student named Ruby Baylor (Matt Damon in one of his finest performances) who is reluctantly hired by a shady lawyer named Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke) at a sleazy practice. Rudy is partnered up with Deck Schifflet (Danny DeVito in another fine performance), a seasoned \\"para-lawyer\\" who failed the Bar Exam 6 times and specializes in it. Deck teaches Rudy the tricks of the trade is Rudy is to move on at all. During the film, Rudy takes on the biggest case of his career: the case of Great Benefit, a life insurance company that has denied a family's claim 8 times and stating in the letter: \\"You must be stupid, stupid, stupid.\\" That family is the Black family (led by Mary Kay Place, \\"The Big Chill\\"). Their son, Donny Ray, is diagnosed with leukemia. The company just sat back and watched Donny Ray's life slip away, and basically, Rudy just couldn't take it anymore. As he goes up against the company's lawyers (including Jon Voight), Rudy also comes to the aid of Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), a young woman who has been abused by her husband far too many times. And the movie goes on from there. Basically, \\"The Rainmaker\\" has the same spirit as any other courtroom drama or as any other Grisham novel. A lot of the credit goes to Matt Damon, Danny DeVito, Claire Danes, Jon Voight, Mary Kay Place, Virginia Madsen, Mickey Rourke, Dean Stockwell, and two special appearances by Danny Glover and Randy Travis for their excellent performances. \\"The Rainmaker\\" is a Grisham film that is not to be missed at all, whether it is on DVD or video.
0446310786|5.0|I don't use those words much to describe a book, but book deserves it with the utmost regard. Based in the small southern town of Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's, it chroniciles the life of Scout Finch, a mischevies little girl with a heart of gold. Her brother Jem, is a tough boy who looks after Scout with all his heart. They meet a young boy who blends in well with them named Dill. <br />Based around the rape trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, it drives through emotions that you wouldn't even believed that you had. One of the greatest scenes in literature is when Atticus, Jem and Scouts father, shoots the wandering dog, left me breathless. <br />If you have a love for anything, read this book, it is really great.
B00005JKZQ|5.0|\\"Showtime\\" is, hands down, the funniest action-comedy ever since the \\"Rush Hour\\" films and the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" series! As for the performances from Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy, they were the best performances that I've seen in a long time. In fact, since Murphy hit it big with the \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\" series. And to me, I think that you very rarely see DeNiro in a comedic role, not to mention when he was in \\"Meet the Parents\\", and that it is such a great departure from his usual tough-guy action roles. \\"Showtime\\" focuses on Mitch Preston (DeNiro), a 28-year police veteran who, during a sloppy bust one night, inadvertedly crosses paths with another cop named Trey Sellars (Murphy), or a.k.a. \\"Ice Trey\\". When the TV stations arrive to film the bust, Mitch loses his cool and shoots the camera, which results in making the front page news and a lawsuit from the TV station that owned the camera. One of the executives, Chase Renzi (Rene Russo) likes what she sees in Mitch and decides to create an idea for a \\"reality\\" based cop show, and the lead is none other than...Mitch Preston, whom Chase invisions him as a real-life \\"Dirty Harry\\". When Chase is given the green light, she and her assistant, Annie (DeNiro's daughter, Drena DeNiro) go out to try to convince Mitch to do the show, but Mitch refuses. And that doesn't go too well with his boss, Capt. Winship (Frankie Faison), who gives Mitch pretty much a reality check on his career if he doesn't do the show. And so Mitch agrees. Now Chase has to think of a partner for Mitch, and soon enough, that part went to none other than Trey Sellars, who is struggling to become an actor, and whom Mitch absolutely refuses to work with! But pretty much, Mitch has no choice as they are now partners for their new cop show in which Sellars describes as \\"SHOWTIME\\"! And hilarity, trouble, and action ensues from there on. \\"Showtime\\" has everything that you'd expect from a Robert DeNiro film...action and a few unexpected laughs! And everythingyou'd expect from an Eddie Murphy film...action and highly expected laughs! This is the second film from director Tom Dey (\\"Shanghai Noon\\") in which he did a brilliant job with. With a top-notch cast, including a special appearance by William Shatner, explosive action, and lots of comedy, \\"Showtime\\" has it all! A great DVD must-own!
6301963911|5.0|A true work of genius. Even by Allen's own standards, this movie is a classic. So few films have Maximum Initial Impact, in that they fail to deliver maximum enjoyment on one's first viewing. <br />While Annie Hall certainly bears considerable repeated viewing, it is simply stunning first time through. Apart from the brilliant dialogue and character depth, it contains so many all-too-human touches. I loved the part on the first date when he asks Annie if he can kiss her before they start, just to take away the tension of will-they won't-they kiss, so that they may more easily relax and enjoy their first time out.<br />As a fairly linear romantic comedy, it is unsurpassed, yet there are also many surrealistic elements which give it a quality that one usually associates with European movies.<br />Woody Allen shoehorned so many brilliant and original ideas into Annie Hall that it is staggering to recall that they were all from the same movie. Everything from the Jew-hating grandmother to the kids in his class telling the camera what they ended up as in adult life, serve to keep you off balance, so that you never slide into a \\"well I can see what's coming up next\\" state of complacency.<br />Allen is a master when it comes to relationships and human failings (and strengths) and his hilarious handling of sexual interactions - \\"I'm just trying to work some circulation back into my jaw\\" - makes this one of those rare movies in which virtually everybody can find something to make you squirm and say, \\"Oh man, he's right\\". <br />Annie Hall is classy, it's beautiful, it is full of love, wisdom and compassion, and above all it is utterly hilarious. A breathtaking work of genius (repetition on \\"genius\\", there) from a man who has no equal in the film industry.
B00005RIKD|4.0|If you're lucky as a musician, when you grow up you get to do what Sting does - reinvent all his pop songs, jazz them up, and make them sound even cooler.  The perfect way to do this is live.<br />As you probably know, this was recorded on 9/11/01 in Italy.  Remember, Italy is six hours ahead of NY, so this happened just a few hours before the show.  Apparently, Sting considered whether to cancel the show.  Thankfully he didn't.  The mood of the album is slightly melancholy, which, I believe, adds depth to the jazz interpretations.  (And when I say jazzy, I don't mean Coltrane or Miles - rather jazz infused pop, a little more so than the Blue Turtles days.)  The interpretations are different and more developed than the album versions - yet not as different as the two Shadows in the Rain versions (Police/Sting).  (If you're one of those types who rants about not hearing the same songs sounding like the same songs - this isn't your album.)  <br />I hate using the word \\"mature\\" because it usually translates as \\"boring.\\"  But this album is mature in the sense of its expanded emotional range.  He opens the concert with Fragile, and it really sounds fragile.  With all the new feelings of sadness, fear, and anger surfacing that day, it feels appropiate we think about \\"how fragile we are.\\"  He moves through several well chosen songs (the set was changed to reflect the somber events of the day) and each is sweeter and sadder than the original.  Seven Days reflects this deeper emotion.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Seven Days isn't on this album.  It's on the Japanese Import version!!  Same concert - 3 more tracks!! (Seven Days, Mad About You, and Shape of My Heart.)  Don't know why record companies do this.  The import is clearly superior - but a little expensive.  THE IMPORT GETS 5 STARS!  Mad About You is incredible!  (So get the import.) With an intense yet subdued driving beat (that's the best I can describe it) better fitting the lyrics.  Don't Stand . . . is played in more of a minor and haunting mood which really fits the song better than the pop original.  Moon over Bourbon St., is improved, if that can be believed, through the use of a trumpet filling under the lyrics.  The third import only track, Shape of My Heart, is also great.  Slightly slower, with sadder overtones using a viola in the background.<br />For anybody who has seen a Sting show, then you know that the sound is fabulous.  The texture is dark, warm, open, and airy like, well, like a summer evening in Tuscany (I couldn't make up anything better if I tried). Is it possible that his voice has improved over time?  Here it sounds slightly lower and huskier, again befitting the darker mood perfectly.<br />The concert finishes on a purposefully upbeat Every Breath You Take.  The concert obviously has an unintended association with the Sept. 11 tragedy, and while it may seem like corporate greed had a hand pushing it through, I believe it is a sobering reminder that every breath we all take is sacred and precious, and that good things also occurred on this day.
B0000520Q2|5.0|i loved this movie. its about 4 friends going on a road trip to retrive a porno flick of  one of the friends cheating on his girlfriend. the funniest part is the grandpa with the boner. if u want a hilarious comedy with a story rent this sex comedy. the unrated version has 5 more seconds of nudity then the rated version.
0141301120|3.0|After having read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory together with my six year old daughter she absolutely wanted to hear more about Charlie and the fantastic factory he got from Willy Wonka.<br />The Great Glass Elevator can not be compared to the first book though, and is probably written for kids much older than my daughter. The plot is too difficult to understand, and especially all the talk about the American president and his advisers does not make any sense - at least not for a kid.<br />We still meet the same Willy Wonka though, the charming, totally crazy man and all his mad ideas. So inspite of the difficult plot part of the book is quite good. My daughter especially liked the part where the grandparents are given the Wonka-Vite pills that will make them 20 years younger, and the fight between the olds to get most pills. But it is dissappointing that such a small part of the book is spent in the chocoalte factory. At least for young kids a sweet factory is much more a place of their dreams than flying around in outer space in a glass elevator.<br />Not among Dahl's best book, but still a good read, especially to read together with a book loving child.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I highly recommend this movie. It is one time when the movie is better than the book. Very action packed and puts you into the battle. My favorite part was at the Battle of Picketts Charge. There is a stirring speech that brings tears to your eyes. I do not want to get into details because I do not want to ruin the movie for others by telling them about it. Mr. Sheen portrays General Lee as if he were actually him. Also you will not believe that the actor that plays Chamberlain is comedy actor Jeff Daniels from such movies as Dumb and Dumber! He is excellent at General Chamberlain. See this movie before visiting the battlefield and it will give you a greater appreciation for what happened there. Also I recommend this movie to homeschool familes and teachers in the public school system as a preview to teaching the Civil War (High school age for battlefield violence). Both sides are evenly depicted so that both are represented as they should be without prejudice toward the north or the south.
0671024256|4.0|On Writing has two appeals. One as a memoir of Stephen King's life, and the other as a fiction writing guide for aspiring authors. The former will be well received by rabid King fans. Desperate King wannabes will covet the latter. Both groups will be satisfied.<br />I was ambivalent about Stephen King's life and writing before reading the book. It's not one I would have chosen; it was a gift. I remain ambivalent about King's life after reading it. The tale he tells is done well enough, but I found little in its content to stimulate me. This is obviously subjective. As one of the world's most successful authors, working his way from poverty to fame and fortune, he has as much right to an autobiography as anyone.<br />As a published author at the other end of the success spectrum, I found the book's guide portion more compelling. I couldn't identify any unique trick or piece of advice, but his perspective on matters is materially beneficial to writers trying to break into the trade. He deals heavily with expectations, work habits, motivation, and many of the conventions of good writing. Although much of it is rehash from other how-to books, he does a fine job with it, offering numerous examples from his own popular books and experiences. Developing writers just can't get too much of this stuff.<br />Surprisingly, there were a few minor typos in the book, and I disagree with his assessment that it's fairly easy to land an agent if your writing is good. My guess is that it has been a long time since King has had to worry about that. Getting an agent is impossible with bad to mediocre writing and very, very difficult even with good writing. \\"On Writing\\" won't replace essential tools such as Strunk & White's or The Gregg Reference Manual, but it has definite value. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead.
014028009X|3.0|I think I made the mistake of watching the film first, and therefore I was expecting to read the scenes that had made me laugh so hard in the film.<br />If you are like me, then you might just  be dissapointed because the book is quite different, and most of the things that happen in the film do not happen in the book.<br />Having said that, the book is in my opinion fresh, funny in some parts and definetly a light and easy read.  The characters are not totally believable, but you can still picture them quite well.  <br />As for Bridget.... I just kept wondering WHAT NOW?... there's a limit to how many stupid things a person can do... sometimes she made me laugh and I identified with her, but others I just felt pity.... <br />I put three stars because I admit I liked the film better, and it made me laugh a lot more than the book.
B00005Y228|5.0|I bought this after reading all of these positive reviews and i must say, majority does rules! The songs are excellent danceable grooves guaranteed to lighten up your day. Kylie's vocal i must say is slightly better than her Locomotion, Teardrops, and duet with Jason Donovan era (by the way, how is he nowadays?). Not much, but enough to support the rest of her music ensambles. She's a pretty good artist, you have to admire her presistence to break into the American market. Over here everybody is a critic. A good thing she came out with this incredible album. Definitely worth to buy and listen to. No, i'm not her biggest fan. I just know good tunes when i hear one.
B00005JKBC|1.0|There is a definite problem with this particular DVD.  Captioning comes and goes through out the entire movie.  Makes watching this great movie incredibly difficult and frustrating.  Movie is great.....but the DVD version is awful.  I think I will just wait until they get the glitches out or buy on VHS when available.
B00005YXZH|5.0|With every new recording, Wilco has gracefully evolved into the band they are supposed to be!  On Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, it is official...WILCO HAS ARRIVED!!!  Not that their previous efforts were short of perfection, they are ALL brilliant!  In my opinion, this album could be compared to a Beatles \\"Revolver\\" for the boys of Wilco, a new departure into the unknown!  This album exhibits moments of sonic beauty, despair, rock n' roll, and ventures into psychedelia!  I have been listening to this album non-stop, and I gurantee you will too!  Oh yeah, what the hell was Reprise thinking when they thought this album was not \\"MARKETABLE\\" and decided to drop one of the best bands in America?  Thank God Nonesuch Records knows what's up!  In short, this record is a masterpiece that is a requirement for your collection!  If your NOT a fan of Wilco, get ready, cause you will be fanatical for them after one listen!
B00000J6AG|2.0|I bought a 12 inch version of Go, years ago. I bought this last week. What a bore! But my grandma like it, she said it was 'pretty' so I guess I'll give it 2 stars for my grandma.
6305603847|5.0|if there is one dvd that you must add to your collection, pink floyd the wall should be it. very few dvd videos out there offer so many extras to such a great film as this and not to mention you are already getting one of the greatest rock-n-roll operas of our time. or should i say one of the greatest films of our time period? in my life, i have never witnessed a film which successfully combine live drama, rock music, and state of the art animation such as the wall has done. bob geldof gives a truly amazing performance as pink who is slowly going crazy in his hotel room. guess what?? the viewer has the ultimate pleasure of taking this grand descent into madness right along with our lead character. through visions of war, godawful childhood memories, and a painful reminescence of a failed marriage we get a glimpse of everything which could DRIVE a person to complete insanity. pink floyd contains some of the most beautiful but insanely grotesque images ever placed on film and probability suggest few films can ever hope to rival the wall here. the wall is an emotional rollercoaster ride which everyone should take atleast once in their life if not many times. again, not a film that a serious dvd collector would want to be without so add this to your collection if you haven't already. i give this dvd my highest rating of five stars. please vote for me if this review was helpful to you and happy viewing.

0393312836|4.0|Frist of all, if there was ever a book that needed a R rateing this would be it. However, dispite the disturbing amount of voilence, and the at times incomprehesable slang the book is a must read. It's thrilling and creepy veiw of the future leads one to question the morality of punishment and the roll of society to \\"cure\\" our criminals of there nature to kill. In the end the book asks the pressing question, when does the cure become worse then the deises? <br />On the down side, the book uses a strange varity of slang that takes a while to get used too, and at times one wonders if they'll ever get through parts. Never the less, it is still a wonderful adventure into the mind of a psycho who, by the end to the book, is much more sane, then the rest of his society.

B000002VMH|5.0|If you have heard the Eurythmics,  you haven't heard but a fraction of Annie Lennox.  In \\"Diva\\" she is in full bloom.  Synthetic sonorous strings and synths fly through the air ahead of her while her silky voice waves and wanders,  paws and prances through a jungle of grooves.  Meanwhile the rhythm section and electronic bass are stalking stealthily behind her like a tiger on the prowl. <BR> <BR>The lyrics are bare naked like a newborn baby and deal with love,  infatuation,  materialism,  death,  suffering,  letting go,  and ultimately -- redemption.  In the fast songs she injects cold,  crystalline wit and wisdom while the grooving hook bubbles over, infecting your lymbic system with energy and vitality.  In the slower songs she takes more time to emote... to let you hear her soul... and to feel your own soul resonate back in the space and time between the notes. <BR> <BR>Often times you will hear people say:  \\"This is music for people who like Pop.\\"  or \\"This is a great album for synth officianados.\\" or \\"This is the best critically-acclaimed female vocalist ever!\\"  I'll go past all the puffed-up titles and labels and superlatives that often miss the point entirely...  and simply sum it up this way:  \\"It's real.\\"
078322608X|5.0|Fascinating science fiction that draws you into a complex world all its own, where time is as much a character as any of the human beings.  Superb performances by Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe, and a riveting turn by Best Supporting Oscar nominee Brad Pitt whose face, hands, and voice seem to be performing three distinct choreographies simultaneously.  Highly stylized set decorations and lavish art direction are enhanced by some truly astonishing special effects shots (gotta love the \\"animals on the loose\\" scenes which are alternately menacing and beautiful). The plot twists and turns back on itself like a pretzel, and then pays off during the last ten minutes of the film with a series of stunning surprises and revelations.<br />The Collector's Edition DVD is truly something special.  In addition to a flawless film-to-video transfer, it includes a satisfying handful of extra features, including cast and crew biographies, the Original Theatrical Trailer, production notes, and more.  Best of all is \\"The Hamster Factor\\", a short film about the making of \\"12 Monkeys\\", which documents the creative challenges, pressures, and processes of modern day filmmaking in a gritty and realistic light, with no egos spared.  This DVD is definitely one to buy, not rent.  The film becomes richer and clearer every time it's seen, and it's one of those complex, multi-layered movies that is best appreciated after multiple viewings. Enter the world of \\"12 Monkeys\\" and enjoy the adventure!

B00003CXI1|5.0|Whenever I watch a film I attempt to categorize it before I go, that way my expectations are usually met. Then I read the reviews of adults trashing the movie as not \\"confronting the social-economic issues\\" Ummm, last time I looked.. Harry Potter is a kids movie.  I have not spoken to one child upset about the movie, sad it didn't deal more with the treatment of Harry by his Aunt and Uncle.  It's a great film, fun to watch, follows the natural progression of the book.  The characters all play theirs roles well. Fun for young and old.  Just maybe not a 30 year old geek wrapped up in a children's book.
0440227534|5.0|I thought that Number the Stars was a wonderful and intriging book. The book allows the reader to see what a young girl thought and felt about what was going on during the Nazi's invasion of Denmark.  The author uses language that allows the reader to feel what a young girl may have been feeling at this time.<BR>I was very impressed with the way that the author uses the theme of pride.  Pride is represented in a number of different ways.  The author illustrates that everyone has pride.  She illustrates that the Jewish people have pride, the King has pride, and all the people of Denmark have pride.<BR>The story also illustrates bravery.  Bravery is shown by so many people in this story.  The author shows the reader that all of the people in Denmark needed to brave.  It also ilustrates that sometimes people do not have the choice to be brave, it is the way of life.<BR>I really enjoyed this book and would recommend this book to everyone.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Man, have these guys been through some serious trials and tribulations to get to this point--and for the most part it has all paid off.  Leaving behind a record company not content with a recording \\"listener friendly,\\" Jeff and the boys buy the rights to YHF for a reported $50,000 and search for a less hostile environment to finish the album.  Nonesuch provides such an environment, widely known as being an \\"artist\\" record label.  During all of this, Jeff loses another music partner named Jay--this time its multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett.  Jeff, though, remains focused and finally gets his record released.<br />The album is great.  And it absolutely swimming in melodies, riffs and lyrics like only Jeff Tweedy can create.  And as always, Jeff's song order is astonishing.  This ranks right up there with \\"Being There\\" and \\"Summer Teeth\\".  In many respects its more consistent than ST.  Although, it does lack that killer track like \\"Shot in the Arm\\".<br />This last section is written to all who have downloaded MP3's of this album.  Do not, under any circumstances, refuse to buy this record because you have a CDR version of YHF.  This is completely unfair to Jeff Tweedy and every other individual who has so much invested in this project.  Do the right thing and buy this CD today.  It will become your soundtrack to the Spring/Summer of 2002.
B0000636UN|5.0|I bought two CDs, one for me and one for a friend as a birthday present.  We all got tanked and went back to her house and broke open the CD.  Everyone was blown away.  IMHO, there is not a bad song on this entire disc.  I know I like a CD when I get obsessed and listen to it over and over, which is exactly what I am doing now.  Sheryl, you just keep getting better and better with every successive release.  Probably the best tracks on this CD are Safe and Sound, Diamond Road, and C'mon, C'mon.  Sheryl is at her soulful best.  This CD is gonna rocket to the top of the charts and produce several hits during this summer, guaranteed.
6304466498|5.0|Spaceballs is by far the best Mel Brooks movie I've seen. The movie begins with Princess Vespa of Planet Druidia, being forced to marry a clutzy, inenpt prince named Vallum. Vespa doesn't love him, but he's the last prince in the galaxy. To avoid the marriage, Vespa and her servant droid, Dot Matrix, escape in her Mercedes space car and hide out. Meanwhile, the ruthless Spaceballs are out to get every breath of air from Planet Druidia, so they decide to kidnap Vespa and hold her as a bargaining chip to convince her father, King Roland, to give them the combination to the sheild that stores their air. To find her, Roland calls on a space pirate named Lone Starr, who at first refuses because he's number one on the hit list of Dark Helmet, leader of the Spaceballs. But then Lone Starr remembers he owes money to Pizza the Hut, a notorious gangster made of pizza. When Roland agrees to give him one million Spacebucks in exchange for his daughter's safe return, Lone Starr is out to find her. When he does, it's obivous the princess and pirate don't get along. However, when his Winebago camper spaceship crashes on a desert moon called Vega, they get closer, and Lone Starr tells her the story of his life, which begins with his parents leaving him at a monestary, where the monks took a vow of silence not to tell him about them. His only clue is a medalion he wears around his neck, which he's taken to every wise man in the universe, but none of them could tell him what it meant, which leads them to a know-it-all named Yogurt, who is also the keeper of a great power called the Schwartz. Meanwhile, the Spaceballs intercept Vespa and take her back to Planet Spaceball, home of the Spaceballs. King Roland finally gives them the combination to the sheild. and by turning their flagship, Spaceball One, into a statue with a vacaum cleaner called Megamaid, they start stealing air. Lone Starr finds them, which leads to a Schartz battle with Dark Helmet, which in turn leads to the ship's demise. Vespa is brought back to Druidia, where Lone Starr turns down his reward. Just when it seems Vespa will be forced to finally marry Vallum, Lone Starr, now found to be a prince himself, shows up to save the day. I'll end this by saying if you're a fan of space movies and are looking for a funny one, this is the one to buy or rent. You'll be more than glad you did.
B000001Y9I|4.0|This is the legendary bands first release with guitar god and former Dixie Dreg, Kansas and solo artist Steve Morse. He takes over the guitar duties from the departed Richie Blackmore. What a compliment he adds to this classic band. With all the original members including; Ian Gillian on vocals, Roger Glover's pounding bass lines, Jon Lord's classic keyboards, Ian Paice on drums, and Morse's strong playing, the band is back to it's classic form. Sometimes with the addition of a new member in a band it changes the dimension or sound of the band. This is not the case. Morse is a huge Deep Purple fan and his addition to the fold shows his appreciation and respect for the band. But he doesn't go for a Blackmore sound-alike. He adds his own style and playing to the band and it really works! This is a really great rock album!
B00005NWM3|2.0|My God, another one of those bands! The vocals are all the same!! The CD starts pretty well, then after two or three songs things fall in the same category: noise, identical vocals, a mess of tracks badly mixed to cover the band's debilities!! IT's a mixture of grunge and nu-metal... well, whatever, this CD is junk.

0440180295|5.0|This is an excellent book that examines the nature of war, its horrors, both psychological and physical, and about Time Travel and Tralfamadore. Whether or not Billy's experiences there are real or not is open to interpretation, it is just an extension of showing his isolation.<br />This book follows no plot and is continually switching time periods. It allows Vonnegut to make his book as diametrically opposite from any other war novel as possible. The very structure of the book seems to deemphasize war. In effect, this makes the story a strange and wonderful creation, needless to say powerful. The story follows Billy Pilgrim (note the name: it is critical to two aspects of his character). Pilgrim is an awkward young man sent to fight in World War II. Yet, the story also follows his experiences in a hospital after the war with an old eccentric named Rosewater, his experience as an opthomologist, his relationship with his family, and, finally, his delusions of Tralfamadore. Certain aspects are included later, such as his dad throwing him into a YMCA swimming pool.<br />This is a novel where nothing is as it seems. At first, it looks as if Billy is doing fine after the war. He lives comfortably, has a profitable practice, and seems happy. Yet, he is tormented by many things, experiences he can't get over, and finally the Tralfamadore visions. A masterfully written novel by Vonnegut.

0385486804|4.0|Into The Wild has left me looking at my own life and thinking about what is really important to me. Chris McCandless, the main character, shows people what life without material possessions give to society and also what they take away. Chris' story had much more effect on myself knowing it was true. For myself, coming from a strong family life, much like Chris, I find his changed outlook on life very hard to understand, especially knowing that he died for what he believed in. Jon Krakauer does a very good job describing Chris' expedition and the harsh reality of wilderness and its unforgiving nature.  I found this book very moving and confirmed my own feelings as to what life should really be about.
0385503954|5.0|...and I agree with the critics who consider this his best effort to date.  I've read Enduring Love and Amsterdam, and am intrigued by a theme which runs though all of them:  the ability of a random event, a seemingly minor decision, or a simple misunderstanding to change EVERYTHING, irrevocably and (usually, for McEwan) horribly.  Add to this his superb prose and, in this case, a haunting story, and you get a book I had trouble putting down (and more worthy of the Booker than Amsterdam).
B00005YXZH|3.0|I, like many others, was taken in by the hype. I have been a fan of Mr. Tweedy's work since Uncle Tupelo. I defended 'Summerteeth' against those who saw it as overblown.I still defend it as a brilliant American album. But 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' is a complete disapointment. Its is slow, slow, slow. Why is it when an artist tries to make a statement he feels the need to slow the tempo of songs down to a dirge? The lyrics are, in many cases, meaningless. I felt like I was listening to a country version of Yes at times. The 'audio experimentation' is cliched. There is nothing new here sonically. Also, Jeff's singing has gotten worse. At least on 'AM' or 'Being There' he seemed to be taking some joy in shouting out his words. Here he just sounds like he is pain, physical pain. Finally, the album goes nowhere. As I listened, I tought that Wilco might be building up to come climax and that the album might be following some sort of arc. No such luck.<BR>Why two stars? Because several songs show what might have been. 'War on War' 'Heavy Metal Drummer' 'I Am the Man Who Loves You' and 'Pot Kettle Black' salvage the middle of the album. But they cannot makeup for the slow death march of the first 3 songs or the last 2. The last song 'Reservations' is a perfect example of the problems of this album. The last 3 minutes of the song are just repetituous noise with no purpose. <BR>So overall, not quite the total diaster that say, 'Kid A' was for Radiohead (go on deny it if you can), but close enough. There was more insight and joy on 'AM' than there is on 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.' (To those who might say, that's cause 'AM' was a toss off, while YHF is a crafted work, I say: give me more spontaneity and less navel gazing.)<br />Revised: 2/27/03: Ok, I might have been a bit hasty, it gets better with repeated listenings. I will give it three stars. Still not up to the quality of 'Summerteeth' or 'Being There' however.
6303921248|5.0|I think this movie is spectacular. I have seen it once and I am trying to buy it. I have tryed all the movie stores in my area and there isn't this movie which makes me so angry because I love it so much. I can't wait until I get it.
B00005JKBC|4.0|What more does this movie need?  Less air time!  This is a long movie, 127 minutes!  It did keep my interest.<br />Robert Redford and Brad Pitt star in this one.  Redford, Muir,  is on his last day bfore retirement from the CIA. Brad Pitt, Bishop, once his &quot;protege&quot;, is in a chinease prison and about to be executed.<br />The entire film is Muir flashing back to when he had originally met up with Bishop, and while explaining this to the CIA, is also trying to help Bishop escape. Does his plan work?  Hmmm...I will not give to much away.  It's a fast paced, well acted, sometimes funny, and very engrossing film that makes you think.<br />It's directed by Tony Scott, who is good at giving us very stylish looking action films like &quot;True Romance&quot; and &quot;Enemy of the State&quot;.<br />For fans of Brad Pitt and Redford, you get to look at their cute faces a lot.  Even in his mature state, Redford, is still very charming and handsome.<br />Worth the rental fee!!
B00003CX8N|5.0|This film will definitely not disappoint fans of Hopkins, Bancroft, and boiled ham. Hopkins delivers a performance that hints at the greatness he would later achieve opposite Brad Pitt in \\"Legends of the Fall,\\" while Bancroft has not been this alluring since \\"The Graduate.\\" <br />But while both stars deliver Oscar-worthy performances, they are both, in one particularly moving scene, nearly upstaged by a third \\"character\\" in the film - a lovely ham sent by New Yorker Bancroft to Hopkins' mild-mannered London book-shoppe owner. After repeated viewings, it still looks delectable, though I am not sure of the variety. Disappointingly, the Bancroft character does not reply in kind, and ham makes no further appearance in the film<br />Another particularly affecting scene involves Hopkins dropping cocktail franks into a pot of boiling water, the franks playing an admirable supporting role to this all-star cast of Americans, Brits, and hams. As Hopkins thoughtfully drops the mini-franks into the water the viewer is dazzled with thoughts of mustards, relishes, perhaps beans?  And who is his butcher? But who cares! Do yourself a favor: throw a ham in the oven, get in your favorite easy chair, and enjoy!
B0000039PW|5.0|Let's say you just flat out didn't like playing poker, OK?Well, if I were to ask you what some of the best hands in poker are and you DIDN'T mention either a royal flush or a straight flush... people would think you were crazy even if you weren't in to poker... well it's the same here. If you don't know that BIG's Ready To Die is the most UNBELIEVABLY put together album... you need help. Seriously, some albums (Tupac's and that's about it) may come close (not too close, don't get carried away), but nowhere near as superior to other albums as this is. I am telling you this not as a rock-hating, soft rock-hating, etc (as a matter of fact I have an enormous collection of Classical pieces and CDs...), but as an all around music lover. This CD is mastermindly complied into one beautiful piece. Compared to Life After Death this is a lot better, no matter how good that was. Every track is classic and slow rocking and very much instrument/beat oriented. With classic ongs, genius verses, and more, this CD is great for everyone! The beats will stick in your head forever... I promise. Ever since Tupac and Biggie died rap has gone downhill; not that rap is a disgrace now, but it used to be more pure. Biggie is absolutely [junk] free in this album.

0792163710|5.0|Many people will lay claim to the fact that \\"The Searchers\\" is the greatest western ever filmed, but it cannot compete with \\"Shane\\" for two reasons.  One, \\"Shane\\" utilizes superior character development in the story.  Everyone of the main characters in the movie creates their own relationship with the viewer and Brandon DeWilde gives perhaps the greatest performance by a child actor in a dramatic role ever filmed.  Secondly, \\"Shane\\" is guaranteed to produce an emotional response that John Ford would kill for.  The critics can cite the technical brilliance of \\"The Searchers\\", But I'll take the common sense brilliance of \\"Shane\\" every day.

0385503954|5.0|Superlatives really do not do this book justice. It is perhaps one of the most haunting and beautifully-crafted novels of the past fifty years with an ending that lingers and affects long after you've turned the final page.<br />Each of the novel's four parts is meticulously crafted. McEwan is a very descriptive writer - particularly in the extended first chapter - but he is not one to waste words. He builds his characters slowly, weaving a subtly etched plot to a quiet but devastating effect.<br />This is a novel to treasure and be read again and again.
B00005RY7X|1.0|True, Andrew W.K. is obviously a joke.  But I do have to respect anyone with the guts to release an album with songs like this.  Ode to partying?  Alright, at least Andy W.K. is having fun.
1573225517|2.0|My opinion on High Fidelity by Nick hornby is that the novel is funny but many passages are a little bit boring because sometimes it's the same content on every page in a chapter. But if you see the film , you will say that the film is better than the novel, cuz the actors are very ood and funny...Bo-email
B00004TRD8|5.0|You can't fault the film even if you tried ... and that go's for the dvd and it's extra features as well okay. So having that in mind all I can say is buy it and add it to your dvd collection.
0684800713|2.0|I thought this novel was quite boring. Let me give you the bottom line. A group of people drank at clubs to get away from their problems and all they thought about was sex. Everyone is this story is so concerned about themselves that it's sickening. All they think about is how they need to satisfy their sexual needs and to cope with that, they drank like every night. I thought Jake, the main character and the narrator, shouldn't have gone through all of this. He doens't deserve all this pain. He's an innocent man that just wants his \\"crush\\" Brett to return his love.<BR> This novel is somewhat similar to modern life now. People do drink to get away from their everyday troubles. But after reading this novel, you realize that love is not about sex. It's about true love.
0780631684|5.0|This film is excellent in it's dvd edition becuase it's all planed out well with crystal clear picture and sound. The animated menue's are well timed. And special features are enough to satisfire anyone and the director's comemtry is excellent as I always enjoy how they decided on the film style etc. There is one point about this dvd that I think they should have change on the uk release and that is the rating of the film. I think that  a 15 rating for this film was to low and should of been an 18 certificate instead. I think US rating by the mpa of america was right on with there rated R certificate. which the R certificate is the equivelent to an 18 in the UK. I would advise that if you are sqimish like me then you should know that there are quite a few scene that are bloodly and sometimes gory. but apart from that the film is definately worth a buy.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I am mad at myself for not buying this CD sooner.  Arie is a breath of fresh air.  Her music is innovative and acoustically rich.  My ears hum when I listen to it.

0881030376|4.0|Fiendship is very important to everyone. In this book Lennie always does something wrong, but he never know what is wrong. George is his only friend, always protects him from danger. They belong to each other. The ranch of Soledad is where they work. In this new work place, Lennie really keeps George in hot water and George has to make a hard choice. They have a sweet dream of land , which belongs to themselves. Will this dream come true? I like this book, because Steinbeck's story is so exciting that I held my breath until I finish reading to the end.
B000051VWW|5.0|It took me a while to warm up to this CD but when I did I realized it is HOT HOT!!  It's not the SADE that you're used to when you think of PROMISE, LOVE DELUXE etc. but it's great all the same.  Her songs tell a story and you feel as if you're going through the experience with her. LOVERS Rock is a gem!

B00005YXZH|5.0|Tweedy &amp; Co.  achieve moments of transcendant beauty on this album.  Dark lyrics are accompanied by haunting effects, yet the album never feels like a downer.  This is perhaps the result of the fact that each track seems to pulse with the band's joyful quest for new sounds, new modes of expression, while still holding to their hooky pop roots.  Check out &quot;Poor Places&quot; and &quot;Jesus, Etc.&quot;

B000060P79|5.0|Simple plan was opening for sugar ray in my small town.  This was great because we don't get many bands.  I got there and a band that I had never heard before was playing.  They rocked, and right away all of my friends and I were excited about this band.  The guys came down while sugar ray was playing and they hung out with me and my friends.  They were lots of fun they are really down to life.  It was great to see how they were so excited when people were lining up to get their autographs.  They were signing shoes, heads, arms, shirts, pants, everything, and they were thrilled about it.  This was the week before their album came out.  I went directly from school to the record store, and wouldn't you know it, they were already sold out.  For about a month, they were sold out and had a waiting list that was longer then you could imagine.  I had to go 8 hours away, to Chicago to find the CD.  Every song on this CD is great.  They can certainly relate to everyones life.  Troubles with friends, familys, boyfriends/girlfriends.  Its great to see a band that is down to earth and has great music.  BUY IT!
B00003CXE7|5.0|Wonderful acting, great sets, stunning costumes, cool story.  One of my favourite all time great movies.  The only tragedy is that Joaquin Raphael Phoenix didn't get an Oscar for his fantastic performance.  One of the best collection of special features on a DVD I have seen.  Will remain in my collection for a long time.
0881030376|4.0|\\"Of Mice and Men\\" writen by John Steinbeek is a book which narrates during the great depression era, the relationship of two men among the indifference of the world around them.<BR>  Those are George -described as a small and quick and dark of face- and Lennie -a very strong and tall guy who has the mind of a young child.<BR>  As they travel together, Lennie goes getting them into trables. That's why they had to move form Weed to Soledad. They only want to reach their dream, to get a own place where yo live, but Lennie's actions get him into a trable which has awful and irrepable consequences that affect not only himself and George but also other characters of the story.<BR>  This is a story of loneliness, frienship, loyalty and corage.
B00003CXB2|4.0|This is a nicely put together DVD, with some attractive extra features.  As for the movie itself, well it has a haunting atmosphere and is vast in its scope and portrayal of Lawrence.  My last viewing was over two nights.  Half way through my attention was beginning to wain and I watched the second half the following night and my enthusiasm was rekindled.  It's a movie that has you thinking about it for a day or two after seeing it.  I found myself trying to analyse the main character and asking myself whether I actually enjoyed the movie or not.  This is a stunning movie, but it's not for everybody.
B00005JKL8|1.0|Astonishingly bogus !  I regret I cannot rate it lower than 1 star.<br />I kept hoping the bad guys would kill the aviator and put me out of my misery watching this turkey. Cinematography, lighting and locations were excellent, but the plot was absurd and the script went from one bizzare farce ( like being able to hear bullets coming when you are the target ) to another ( like the bad guys killing the pilot instead of using him as a hostage ).  Then there was the memorable scene where the bad guys were standing within 4 feet of the hero in a flat muddy area, but could not find him.  Perhaps the worst was the hero hiding under snow / ice for 15 min and jumping out just at the right moment to off the main bad guy. Maybe our boy had a periscope - that would be no more improbable than the rest of this waste of film.  Gene Hackman usually indicates a worth-the-money movie. He should be ashamed.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|I've never seen the origonal Gone in 60 Seconds, but what I can tell you is that this movie is the best!!! I love the GT 500.  I've watched it probably 30 times, sometimes twice in one day, I can say all the lines in the movie by heart.  This is a must have!!!
B00003CWPL|5.0|...I first heard about Eraserhead from a film teacher friend of mine who always provoked heated class discussions with it. I didn't know what he was talking about until I saw it for myself.  Eraserhead is hard and at times confusing to sit through, but its basic plot line is simple:  boy and girl have to get married because of an unexpected pregnancy.  Girl, frustrated with parenthood, goes back home, leaving her husband to care for the child, which was born prematurely. Husband also becomes frustrated because he fantasizes that he would have a much better chance at his sexy neighbor across the hall if he didn't have a child whose hideousness, he believes, reflects on him.  A major portion of the \\"action\\" is a mock-romantic dream he has about the woman and himself.  The film is filled with gritty and shocking images of Henry's banal daily life.  Some scenes are screamingly funny, especially where the prospective husband must first run the gamut of meeting the future bride's family:  it's a \\"meet-the-family\\" nightmare with a zombie grandma and the tastiest little chickens you'll ever contemplate for dinner.  Other scenes depict Henry's pathetic desire to escape to some fantasy paradise hidden in the radiator.  The final scenes are guaranteed to have you white-knuckled, though not for the usual reasons.  Soundtrack? Something like chalk scraping a blackboard.  It's as though Lynch did everything to challenge his audience not to sit through the film, but this is a must-see for anyone interested in creative, daring use of the medium. It will stick with you in the way art is supposed to.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Definitely a CD to sit and listen to every track amazed at where the songs go and how it all hangs together when you think it can't and surprises you when you think you know where its going.
0345451325|4.0|Imagine Starship Troopers (the book) and then imagine it as being a little easier to read and without the bugs. Thats &quot;The fall of Reach&quot;. Overall a good SciFi book, which is even better if you are a fan of the game. My one complaint is that the editing is a little sloppy. Nothing that will hinder the enjoyment of the book but enough to make you scratch your head once or twice.

B00005A1PR|5.0|I believe India Arie should have gotten a grammy. Her CD is soul full and is something you can relax to. I think the real reason she did not get a Grammy is because Alicia Keyes was winning everything and that is because of the people backing her. I believe that Ms. Keyes' album was not better than India's . Her should at least gotten one four out of her seven nomination. But I have to give it to Alicia, she can sing but there is something about Arie's style of music that I like more. Her style is more down to earth something you would listen to, to relax your mind, body and soul. But this will probably not hurt her but make her come out with a better album next year and have Ms. Keyes in the shadows of her fame.
0385503954|5.0|ATONEMENT is a wonderful book. The sort of book that reminds you what reading really good fiction is all about.  ATONEMENT reminded me of the first book you read when you're growing up that absorbs you so that you can hardly put it down.  And you're sad when you don't have it to read anymore.  It's that good!  Enjoy it!
0767020308|5.0|I have to say that I love Jane Austen's book &quot;Emma&quot;. I like it much better then her other works like Pride &amp; Prejudice. So I'm glad that A&amp;E did a version of &quot;Emma&quot; since they do such a good job at making great movies. <BR>Anyway, this adaption of Emma is perfect! Much better then the Gwyneth Paltrow version.  <BR>Kate Beckinsale IS Emma. She was nice yet had that snotty air about her that Emma is suppost to have. Paltrow's Emma was to goody-goody.  I thought the point of Emma was that she was a sort of a brat.  <BR>I love Mark Strong as Knightly. He was just PERFECT! I think Jeremy Northam did very well as Knightly in the GP's version of Emma but he looked to young. And I missed the scolding that Strong's Knightly did to Emma. JN's Knightly was to soft.<BR>Raymond Coulthard is great as Frank Churchill. He's handsome and very charming. I can see why Emma found him pleasing. Ewan MaGregor who played Churchill in other version didn't seem to be right to play the part. And what was with his hair??? That's NOT cute! <BR>I'm so glad that A&amp;E did the whole Frank Churchill/Jane Fairfax thing that they DIDN'T show in the GP version. <br />Take my advise and buy this version. If you are a TRUE Jane Austen lover, you won't be disappointed.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|If you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly, gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds, tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together, well, then this movie is definitely for you! It's the kind of film that you actually have to see twice to fully appreciate  and one that will likely creep the heck out of you if watched alone in the dark.<BR>And one thing this film doesn't have, unlike its Hollywood-ian counterparts like THE HAUNTING, is special effects. In fact, that's one of the greater things about this movie: it feels real because it looks like it's actually taped on video with very credible actors in very credible circumstances Another great thing about it is that it's actually very gory and somewhat violent in theme, and yet we rarely see anything of the sort on the big screen
B00005JKL8|5.0|This movie kept me interested the whole time.  Very fun to watch... A little bit [unreal]fake at times, but still, great DVD.. Worth getting...
B000002MY3|1.0|I got this album because it is considered by many to be a definitive alt-rock album of the 90's.  This is one of the worst albums I own, and it sullies my entire collection.  What do you do with bad lyrics, horrendous singing, and music that's erratic and poorly written?  You call it a classic.  And make the creator the messiah of all women musicians.  Alanis really paved the way for faux-feminist corporate cheese pop/rock  that's the philosophical equivalent to Gap in its faux-authenticity.  No wonder, she did a commercial with them.  Who did this CD inspire?  Meredith Brooks.  Case in point.  Alanis is like Madonna.  There are some catchy tunes, some good videos, and a good personality to have on a talk show.  But in the end, do either of them write songs with musical complexity or lyrical depth or create albums that have artistically substantial content?  At least Madonna is honest about who she is and has fun with it.  Alanis wants to take the credit for every female artist to emerge after this album came out.  Some good songs include the singles that we all know and love (or hate) on variety radio, and then the rest sound as if they were recorded with the mindset that no one would have to hear them.  Check out Bjork, Fiona Apple, PJ Harvey or Tori Amos instead- the REAL female musicians, and the ones that are actually responsible for any respect female musicians have gotten.

B000002BE9|5.0|I like Tidal because Fiona articulates emotions I've felt before but could never really express, as on \\"The First Taste\\" when she sings, \\"adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red.\\"  The lyrics are blunt yet artful and poetic.   Delivered by Fiona's bruised and world-weary, yet innocent voice, they have even more power.  At first glance, Fiona Apple may appear sullen or humorless but the fact that she is so well-spoken and talented at singing and songwriting seem to make her brooding okay, because it seems real and natural.    <br />Musically, Fiona is a genius and that's a fact.  Her songs are contradictory, the opening a loud brash and angry song, \\"Sleep To Dream,\\" while the next song \\"Sullen Girl\\" is soft and quiet, with lyrics like \\"It's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion.\\"  She's talking about rape, and it's extremely powerful.  The next song is pure pop \\"Shadowboxer\\" with a hint of after-hours torch balladry, \\"Criminal\\" is alt-pop with lyrics like \\"What I need is a good defense, cuz I'm feeling like a criminal.\\"  Fiona knows how to sing her songs with an exceptional voice, write lyrics that mean something yet fit within the complexity of her songs, and still manage to emotionally affect the listener effortlessly.  \\"Never Is A Promise\\" is perhaps her signature song.  The strings soar, the piano is hushed and Fiona is at her most vulnerable.  Meanwhile \\"The Child Is Gone\\" is about a loss of innocence, as evident in the title.  \\"Carrion\\" is an inredible soliquay about a decaying relationship told through a beautiful acoustic guitar and then later, a whole barrage of sonic imbellishments courtesy of producer Andrew Slater, and his team of amazing session musicians, including Jon Brion, the man who would later produce Fiona on When the Pawn.  This is a remarkable album.<BR>Listen to the song \\"Never Is A Promise\\" and I think we can all agree that Tidal is an amazing album.
0393317552|2.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (Norton 1997), winner of the 1997 Pulitzer Prize, is written by Jared Diamond, a professor of Physiology at UCLA School of Medicine, who also writes about ecology and evolutionary biology.  Diamond supposedly wrote this book in response to a question posed by a New Guinea politician:<br />\\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\" Or, put in another way, \\"why did Europe colonize New Guinea, and elsewhere, instead of the other way around?\\"<br />Diamond's theory is that the reasons have little, if anything, to do with biological differences, cultural systems or human effort; it has to do with the location of superior agriculture and domesticable animals. He attempts to prove his theory by examining the world, as it must have looked 13,000 years ago. <BR>Diamond examines three paramount factors: <br />A. The shape of the continent;<BR>B. The distribution of domesticable wild plants and animals; and<BR>C. The geographical barriers inhibiting diffusion of domesticated plants and animals.<br />The location that incorporated these three factors led to the earlier decline of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle and encouraged farming.  This, in turn, led to social stability, government, learning, and, eventually, armies and explorers.<BR>Diamond identifies Eurasia, which had the good fortune to be situated in an east-west orientation (\\"axis\\"), to be the perfect highway for agriculture to spread. The mid-latitude region of Eurasia, had the largest continuous zone of temperate climates and, therefore, was more conducive to the origination of superior and plentiful plants and animals.  Thus, Eurasia was \\"fated\\" to be the center of farming and, indeed, became the birthplace of civilization.<br />According to Diamond, continents with a north-south axis (e.g., Africa, the Americas), was not conducive to the spread of agriculture as plants hadto move through different climate zones.  There is no discussion of the adaptability of plants, even though that is an essential element of domesticability.   The ubiquitous potato now thrives in many areas foreign to its place of origination.<br />Diamond's theory based on the domestication of wild animals is a little stronger.  The early domestication of animals in Eurasia eventually led to human resistance to certain diseases acquired from animals. European explorers had developed significant immunities to diseases to which the people in the New World had no resistance. Thus, smallpox wiped out an entire civilization, or at least rendered the people defenseless to invaders.<br />Diamond argues that the contiguous nature of the countries in the east-west axis, as well as their temperate environments, led to rapid dispersion of plants and the domestication of animals.  Actually, there are many inhospitable barriers within Eurasia, which, under Diamond's theory would block diffusion. However, Diamond does not address this factor.<br />Diamond also fails to explain, adequately, why Australia, which has a climate similar to the mid-lateral region of Eurasia did not begin farming until much later. <br />Diamond concludes that Eurasia was fated to be the winner in the worldwide historical competition because of geographical and environmental advantages. Then approximately 500 years ago, Europe pulled ahead of China and assumed sole dominance.  The lack of competition within homogeneous China was given as the reason Europe became sole victor in the end.<br />There are several major problems with Diamond's theory.  The first is the absence of any provable, corroborating evidence.  Under his theory if the New Guinean man and his descendants had switched places with the Europeans 10,000 years ago, those people would have become the colonizers, instead of the colonized. <br />The book also is heavily biased by the author's \\"reverse\\" racism views. In response to the questionof whether there are any biological differences today between Aboriginal Australians and Europeans, Diamond states:<br />\\"The objection to such racist explanations is not just that they are loathsome, but also that they are wrong.  Sound evidence for the existence of human differences in intelligence that parallel human differences in technology is lacking.  In fact ... modern \\"Stone Age\\" peoples are on the average probably more intelligent, not less intelligent, than industrialized peoples.\\"<br />The author's choice of the word \\"loathsome,\\" an emotionally loaded word, to describe racism sets the tone for this very politically correct book.<br />This reviewer's impression is that Diamond has a pre-determined conclusion, and he relies on certain theories to support it, but ignores those same theories when they don't support his conclusion. In the end, Diamond does not establish a credible response to the New Guinea man's questions.  To the extent the book purports to be a scientific study of history, the author has made a very basic error: he attempts to explain a \\"fact\\" - that there are no biological differences among different groups of people - without first establishing that that indeed is a fact.<br />Guns, Germs, and Steel is an interesting, politically correct story of the evolution of civilization, but I would not recommend it as a scientific study of history. Though fairly easy to read, the book is very repetitive and unnecessarily long to make the author's point.  One hundred or more pages easily could have been cut.

B000003BF4|5.0|The Rolling Stones' 1969 tour will go down as one of the most infamous events history, thanks to its tragic finale. However it also featured the Stones at their most exciting and most vibrant, displaying some of their greatest songs with all the energy and sleaze (much emphasis on the latter) that a great Stones show should offer. Mick Jagger proves his ability as the all time greatest frontman, with a stage presence that is just down and dirty (and this was before Ozzy Osbourne and David Lee Roth). Mick Taylor proves his worth as the Stone's greatest guitarist, and it is amazing to hear Taylor and Keef play off each other so well. Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts continue to be the greatest rhythm section in rock and roll, and did i mention that magnificent stage renditions of classics such as Jumping Jack Flash, Honky Tonk Woman, Midnight Rambler (the live version on this disc made this a classic), and Sympathy for the Devil ought to make you drooool with satisfaction.<br />Make no mistake about it. This is THE greatest non compilation Stones album, and without a doubt one of the greatest live albums EVER!! This was the Stones at the peak of their powers (they had just come off Beggar's Banquet and Let it Bleed, and were just about to release Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street) on a live stage in Madison Square Garden. While their albums could become tired and just plain bad, they continue to be the greatest live band in the world, playing hit after hit with a glorious vigor even as they push 60! However back in '69 they had a youthful lust and sleaze  that made their show all that more effective. This is a perfect representation what made them great, and is essential listening for anyone who loves true rawk 'n' roll. If you haven't heard it yet shame on you. If you don't like it ... may you spend an eternity listening to Britney Spears, Limp Bizkit, and Marylin Manson.
0446608955|3.0|I read and heard how wonderful and emotional this book was. I bought it and read up to chapter 8. This book didn't move me. I became bored and frustrated with the story. I don't know what type of person you need to be to enjoy something like this...but it wasn't for me. The author is an excellant writer with a warm presence. Although this book bored me to death doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it. If you want a sweet story with good morals and values then this is for you. I have to admit though this book is refreshing from all the mess that's written today.
B000002MIB|5.0|Let's Face it. If a band wants to prove its greatness, the live stage is where they will have to prove it. After all few great bands have not released a great live album. Enter Van Halen.<br />Right Here Right Now documents the first six years of the Van Hagar years. There are high octane, mind blowing, solo passages from Alex Van Halen (will put you into a seizure), Michael Anthony (That's right. a BASS Solo), and of course the all mighty guitar GOD Eddie Van Halen. Sammy Hagar proves his worth as a party man and eternal teenager, and his stage presence makes for pure electricity. Many songs, most notably the ballads, sound far less dated than their studio counterparts (Dreams, Give to Live, Best of Both Worlds, Why Can't This Be Love). It isn't very surprising that only four songs from the DLR era (If that were the case Hagar would come off as just Van Halen's new mouthpiece) are included in the set, but they are some of the very best, and are some of the album's best performances. (Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love, You Really Got Me, and of course Jump) And then there are some magnificent rockers; Judgement Day, Runaround, Top of the World, a mind blowing rendition of the Who's Won't Get Fooled Again, and what is by far Sammy's greatest solo career song One Way to Rock.<br />In conclusion this a magnificent representation of what a carefree stage presence that Van Halen had. Sure it would be nice if they released some live DLR material (they could have done one disc for Sam, and one disc for Dave), but this album will still be able to make your heart beat just a little faster. This is one of the most exhilirating albums you'll ever own, and certainly the best of the Van Hagar era. Don't be discouraged by any negative reviews you'll see. Just get it RIGHT NOW!
B00005O5CM|5.0|Legally Blonde is one of the best underdog movies I've ever come across. Reese Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a Beverly Hills blonde with a fashion designing career in order and a Hawaiin Tropic belt under her . . . belt. When her boyfriend (Matther Davis) decides to dump her and go to Harvard to pursue a career in Law, Elle figures the only way to win him back and to show him up at his own game. So Elle heads off to Harvard, and certainly does show a lot of people that blonde is a whole lot more fun than people put on.<br /> Legally Blonde came as a surprise hit to Hollywood. But it's totally worthy of it's praise. The screenplay is smooth going and never hits a corny note, even with some of the characters that could have been ultra corny. Reese Witherspoon absolutely shines as Elle Woods. Jennifer Coolidge was adorable as Elle's new best friend, Paulette. Matthew Davis played the part of the rich, snobby boy to the core, and Selma Blair's change in character was flawless. She's too cute. The rest of the supporting cast all gave great performances, as well as the little Chihuahua who played Bruiser.<br /> The Special Edition dvd is a must-have for your collection. There are two audio commentaries with film crew and Reese Witherspoon. Two features, one which goes into full detail on the movie; from the beginning of the idea to the end result. I was glad to see this instead of a 7 minute or so promotional spot which is marked as a featurette. This part of the DVD is a much watch. The other featurette is all about Reese's hair and is a fun little ditty. There are 8 or so deleted scenes, some with commentary from director Robert Luketic. Rounding out the extras are the theatrical trailer, production notes, and cast &amp; crew bios. The picture quality is great with Elle's bright colors contrasting well with the fall colored background of Harvard. The audio is also very good.<br /> Legally Blonde will certainly stand out from the rest, and it's all thanks to the cast andcrew, and mainly, Reese Witherspoon.
0792156684|5.0|I understand why so many people did not like this film.  Titanic clocks in at over three hours, which is a very long time to stay put in one place, especially if a movie doesn't hold your interest!!  So many would say that Titanic's plot is trite, cliched, and predictable.  But you know what, I thought Titanic was a really good love story.  Love it or loathe it, you have to admit the special effects were awesome, the music was incredible (and I'm not even talking about My Heart Will Go On), and Kate Winslet was amazing, as always.  This is one of those epic tales that only comes around once in a blue moon, so see the film regardless of what others say.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Any fan of Wilco knows that the past year-and-a-half-or-so has been a frustrating one. Wilco was ready to release this outstanding accomplishment of an album in 2001, but Reprise (its former label) didn't hear a single. Jeff Tweedy and Company knew they had something special on their hands, so they bought the album back from Reprise and found a new home at Nonesuch Records -- and boy are we lucky that they did.<br />Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (YHF) is an instant classic, reminiscent of great albums like Pet Sounds, Revolver and Dark Side of the Moon. And like the bands that created those albums, Wilco has expanded its scope and sound with each record it's recorded. The experimentation on YHF is refreshing, the lyrics are sometimes unintelligible yet unforgettable and the music is passionate, intelligent and unlike anything else you'll hear out there. Wilco is quite simply the best band in America.<br />A lot of the themes on YHF deal with relationships, whether distant or close-by, but some of the strongest themes are imbedded in songs like Jesus, etc. and Ashes of American Flags. Since Sept. 11, several Americans have become lifelong patriots, proudly displaying their flags and wearing red, white and blue. Jeff Tweedy's songs were written before September 11, but you'd never know it. They eerily question our lacking love of country and properly pay homage to it...&quot;I would like to salute / the Ashes of American flags / and all the fallen leaves / filling up shopping bags.&quot; Patriotism has never sounded so sweet.<br />New drummer Glenn Kotche is most impressive. His contributions are concise, exact and expansive. Apparently he's banging on everything from pipes and bottles to his actual drum kit. Whatever his technique(s), he certainly adds  interesting elements to each song. I'm still a big fan of Ken Coomer (check out the band Swag), but I can see now why Glenn was added to the band.<br />The production on YHF makes for an interesting aural experience. (You've got to put the headphones on for this one!) This album is so complete; I've listened to it repeatedly since purchasing it on its release date and I wish I could afford to buy a copy for everyone reading this. Support this great band and buy a copy or two of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. You won't regret it!ot to put the headphones on for this one!)

Yet I feel that the experience is made all the better if one watches 12 Monkeys in conjunction with an earlier Terry Gilliam film Brazil.  Many questions posed in 12 Monkeys seem to make all the more sense when looked at through the lens of the worlds created in Brazil- another must see!
B000063DHL|5.0|This is one of the most profound Iron Maiden records. It is the first album ever in which they used keyboards. Adrian Smith makes a supreme contribution by his unique songwriting represented by singles 'Wasted Years', 'Stranger In A Strange Land, and 'Sea Of Madness', while Steve Harris offers us one of his trademark opuses: a song called 'Alexander The Great' in which we can listen to some motives taken from Balkan folkmusic. Another hit is 'Heaven Can Wait'.
B00005YUPO|5.0|Just a word in defense of Baby Bach. Our son saw this DVD first and likes it better than Baby Mozart. My thought is that they love what they know. Also, BB has children throughout, which my son really responds to. Baby Mozart only has one child in the last frame. You really can't lose whichever Baby Einstein you buy. They are fun, and the babies really find them entertaining.
B0000640VO|5.0|Although I have studied French @ University to PhD Level & have therefore been influenced by French cinema, I can objectively say that Amelie is a movie that can inspire & mesmerise the most hardened anglophone.  Perhaps one of great cultural changes of recent times has been Hollywood's embrace of more & more foreign language movies (Life Is Beautiful, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Ring, Audition to name but a few).  Amelie's appearance is therefore as timely & strategic as it is wonderful.  The film embarks on a magical journey of a young & naive girl who works as a waitress in Montmartre & the quirks of her everyday life & the people with whom she encounters.  Amusing & touching, & perfectly shot, the tight script & gripping colours & cinematography render this oeuvre a captivating watch which shall mesmerise again & again.  Audrey Tatou plays the ingenue with such wit & charm (as the cheeky cover alone suggests) as a woman who influences others more than she wishes her own life to be influenced.  Some of the most captivating scenes are Tatou dashing pebbles across the water (it's ony about 15 seconds long but majestically shot) & the character introductions at the beginning (her parents are wickedly hilarious) & the evil greengrocer & Amelie's revenge on him.  If there's one movie you should consider purchasing it is definitely this.  Perhaps my favourite French movie now (along with Les Visiteurs, Manon Des Sources & Cyrano de Bergerac), it shall get repeated plays on my DVD player.  Great extra features too!
0679411585|1.0|This book is exactly what Americans love after Sept 11, 2001. It pampers to the myth of the American heroic spirit in war. The purpose of the book is to glorify the \\" brotherhood\\" and \\"bond\\" of American soldiers using their superior firepower to inflict maximum kills on the enemy. The high moral tone of the book started with the mention about the Air Calvary's historical links to Custer. How can the authors take pride in associating themselves with a barbaric Indian killer? And like Custer, the US military in Vietnam thought they could take on the North Vietnamese Army whom they regarded as no more sophisticated than the American Indians slaughtered by them in the 19th Century.<br />There was some tribute paid to the Vietnamese but it was done grudgingly. The only way the American soldier can prove himself is to take on an enemy with equal firepower.<br />I am glad I didn't buy this book with its load of self-indulgent nostalgia.
B00005YXZH|5.0|reprise records are a bunch of idiots. wilco crafted this beautiful, dark, quiet, noisy, and challenging artistic record. they gave it to reprise (with pride, i assume), who not only rejected it, but also decided to cut the band off its label roster. the band eventually found a home, nonesuch records (ironically, owned by aol/time warner, who also owns reprise), and after many hassles, tears, and band members, yankee hotel foxtrot is upon us.<BR>the record starts vaguely reminiscent of 1996's \\"being there\\" opener \\"misunderstood\\", ending in a bunch of \\"revolution 9\\"-esque racket involving other songs on the record. the bouncier tracks, like \\"radio cure\\", and \\"heavy metal drummer\\" break up the dense, sullen nature of this record. bit i gotta say, this record is not a bummer in the least bit. this is the stuff bands dream of doing. \\"ashes of american flags\\" is classic, and something about the description of the cash machine incident just gets me, and i have no idea why. <BR>their 1999 record \\"summerteeth\\" was the last perfect pop record i heard, and this one seems to take off where that left off. unlike the two records they recorded with billy bragg (mermaid avenue vols. 1 and 2, which consisted of wonderful interpretations of woody guthrie songs\\", the songs challenge the listener in a way that few do, much less attempt to. there are plenty of wonderful sounds on here, and it takes many listens to discern them all.<BR>but it doesn't end there. named after the opening track on YHF, \\"i am trying to break your heart\\" is a full-length documentary on two years in the life of wilco. this is american rock and roll, in its pure form, and although it seems odd that a not-so-big band from chicago earned a full-length film that will do the album justice (at least from the lengthy trailer i saw), it makes perfect sense. singer/guitarist/god jeff tweedy's work can also be found on the just released soundtrack to the film \\"chelsea walls\\".<br />this is a glorious record, and it deserves the attention of anyone who can appreciate a listen that is not only fulfilling, but challenging.
B000001FTJ|4.0|This is where the sonic carnival really started.  It's true that Blue Valentine hints that something funny was in the air but on Swordfishtrombones, Waits really decided to take off.  Lyrically this album is brilliant for it's evocation of times and places that may or may not have ever existed but also really nails some true feelings.  Musically it's like a wild cabaret with instrumentation no one could have expected.

B000002L68|4.0|Prince knew he had made the album that brought him commercial success. In PURPLE RAIN we get a glimpse of his potential which would be fufilled when he released SIGN 'O' THE TIMES in 1987.<BR>   But bar the film, this album alone deserved the success it got. The music was a revelation in his career then - compare it to his first four albums and see how far he came forward. The songs are powerful, hard rock and rock fans who disagree should reconsider - just listen to the title track. 'Computer Blue' is an enjoyable song which should have been much longer than it's 4 minutes suggested. 'Let's Go Crazy' shows Prince in Hendrix mode- check out the awesome guitar solo at the end of it. 'I Would Die 4 U' is a strange but incredibly effective track, with Prince singing as passionately as he had done in his career up to that point. 'Baby I'm A Star', which is reached via a segue through the before mentioned track, keeps the flow going and sets the standard for his best live performance. An effervescent number it is definately the most funkiest track on the album. And before I forget, the brilliant 'When Doves Cry' is one of his most popular, and not to forget original, tracks. It must be the only song that I've heard that wouldn't work with a bassline and that, along with the pretty melody and fantastic harmonic voices, stands it out from the rest of the album as well as some of the best songs of Prince's career.<BR>    A gem of an album but the fact that it wasn't very funky, a term that we always associate with Prince's music, puts it behind SIGN 'O' THE TIMES in the best Prince album charts but don't let that put you off. Buy it now, it's well worth the money.

B00003CWL6|5.0|There's so much to say about this movie. This movie will leave you looking in total amazement at it and make you wonder how true and beautiful the stuff in it actually is. <br />It describes our lives, our day-to-day lives and the complexities attached to them. There's so much confusion, misconception, deception, affection, involved in our lives that its hard to believe. <br />The movie's about a family which is totally unsatisfied with each other. The father is going through a mid-life crisis and quits his job to work at a fast food joint and also falls for his daughter's best-friend, the mother starts having an affair with her business rival and the daughter hates them both going through tough times as well. In spite of all these complicated things the movie is produced in such a beautiful and charismatic way that you are absolutely shaken by it. The lives of many people are depicted in this movie and makes you wanna go and join them.<br />The movie's SCORE is the best I have ever heard yet. Thomas Newman has done a wonderful job, goes perfectly with the movie's scenes and plots.<br />Overall, I would give it 10 stars.

Since \\"One-Armed Scizzor\\" by some random pop whim shot them into the mainstream, alot of flare started off for possibly one of the strangest groups in rock music. The key ingredient in their music is the lyrics...they're bizarre, cerebral, seemibly stream-of-conicousness or free association or elsewise darkly imaginative and hard to understand. That's the first ingredient. Mix that with an amazing intensity that melds punk, reggae, ska, techno, and darkwave into a thoroughly interesting packet...<br />...waves of skull rocking intellect-punk that goes to the fullest possibility of our mind's and ear's capabilities with mixbags of thought rock such as \\"Sleepwalk Capsules\\" and \\"Pattern Against User\\" then settles sown on solid ground that's unstable enough to tremor you with the political ballad \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\" (which is appreantly about the ... traficking of foreign girls in Mexico, forced to give up dreams and lives to work in sweat shops and on sweaty johns) and the creepy \\"Non-Zero Possibilty\\" (a song that could come strait from Blade Runner or a cyber-punk meditator, filled with moody synths and jangled vocals)...<br />...\\"Enfilade\\" has a twisted techno latin beat and futuristic vocals that lead up to the rocking chorus of \\"Sacrifice on railroad tracks/Freight train coming, freight train coming\\", it starts out with a leopard man talking on a telephone making ransom arrangements...I'll be the hyena you'll see...<br />Basically, this album kicks arse. Boundary-transcending rockabilly. It'll have you jaggin' sliced pulp in your veins and hacking the spines of paragraphs in no time.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Commonly known as the band with that chick singing &quot;it's Yoooooouu&quot; over and over. Male-fronted, Sigur Ros could be simply described as an icelandic Radiohead. The mood, though very experimental, is one of the most relaxing records ever. The lush sound puts you in a trance. The vocals do nothing more than further the dreamlike mood. Sung androgonously, in a mixture of Icelandic and a language that the band made up(it sounds pretentious, but it's pretty unique)the vocals blend right in perfectly. The single,  Svefn g englar(AKA - The song which will soon be on a Pure Moods disk)pretty much shows what the album is going to be like. This cd gets a perfect rating from this reviewer, but it really isn't for everyone. It is a good for more of a &quot;house cd&quot; not really good to drive to because it tends to put you in such a sleepy-tranced state. Speaking of which, it is great to put on repeat thought the night.Oh,and the packaging of this disk is above average as well. I recommend this if you are looking for an experimental &quot;chillout&quot; band with a totally alien sound.
B00000JKH2|5.0|More polished than In Casino Out and more electronic and Radioheadesque than Relationship Of Command, Vaya is an interesting little sidetrip between the two worlds, and I say little because the overall cd's a little less than 24 minutes long. Very hard to describe, there's still the punk emo influence but just a world unto it's own...<br />The lyrics are ofcourse awesome, beautifully poetic, futuristic, and incapable of description. Songs such as \\"Metronome Arthritis\\" reflect shades of political veiwing or even paranoia (\\"What if forensics finds the answers? What if they stole my fingerprints?\\" Cedric says), \\"Ursa Minor\\" seems like it's telling a tale of future oppressions of gravity police and such (\\"propeller snapped/decapitated while you slept upon your pillow/inertia kisses those around me\\")...<br />\\"Heliotrope\\" might have references to religious conspiracy, \\"Proxima Centauri\\" is an intergalctic droolfest involving ancient Romans in space...the crazy vocal blabbering at the end of \\"300Mhz\\" is a nice experience...the overall effect of this EP is a sound experiment signal sent via satellite from another planet. It's also a good and relatively cheap installment to get if you want to sample ATDI. Afterwards, you'll want to try out their actual albums.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Kevin Smith's debut film, Clerks, is a brilliant piece of comedy.  This film, like other Kevin Smith films, is carried largely by the quality of the screenplay's dialogue and the quality of actors chosen for it.  While the acting in this film, being his first, independently produced, film, does not approach the level of Chasing Amy or Dogma, Jeff Anderson and Brian O'Halloran, it does not need to.  The comedy in the film manages to be new and entertaining despite its seemingly base, retread topics: drugs, sex, and of course, hockey and Star Wars.  Smith's mastery of comedic dialogue is evident in this film, his very first, and Anderson and O'Halloran are the perfect comedic duo to carry the material.  The film exhibits Smith's great potential both as a writer and a director.
6302135621|5.0|Citizen Kane is a film that every aspiring filmmaker wished they had in them. I would compare it to The Great Gatsby, in that every fiction writer wished they had written that. Neither work has the greatest story, but both are presented with such style that the reader or watcher is blown away in amazement.
B00005JL9B|5.0|I am personally a big fan of movies that push limits and break boundaries.  Other movies would include South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut, The Matrix, and anything that badmouths Jimmy Fallon (one day, one day).  Anywho, Battle Royale contains an insane idea, but it is not ashamed to depict what it would be like to see little High School Freshmen kids murdering each other.  From the teacher's sadistic apathy towards the tournament to the first child murdering another child with an arrow through the neck, it never ceases to show the realism of what would happen if the BR Act existed.  Good movie all in all.  I liked the realism.
6305307261|5.0|Forget all but this interpretation of Dracula.  It takes the essence of the Bram Stoker story and purifies it with sounds, scenes and characterisation that will never leave you.  It will swirl around in your mind blending modern history, Revelation and human folly and complacency.  Who is truly the most evil - Nosferatu or human beings?  This is a journey through more than the mists of the Carpathean Mountains.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Off on another adventure(s) with Wilco.  Supposedly the band had to purchase the tapes from their old label who weren't real happy with the body of work.......what do they know.  Although to some, the songs may not be as accessible as those on &quot;Summerteeth&quot;.  That doesn't make this set any less enjoyable.  In fact it's a step further into the sonic/pop musings of the last CD.  Heavy Metal Drummer sounding like something Ray Davies might've come up with.  Other standouts include War on War, Ashes of American Flags and the haunting Reservations with it's line &quot;I've got reservations about so many things, but not about you&quot;......pretty cool.
B00005YXZH|4.0|Jeff Tweedy, singer and songwriter of Wilco, might have the most interesting career in rock. He co-founded Uncle Tupelo, the first band of the so-called alt.country movement, then went on his own with Wilco, which has done everything from straight twangy rock (\\"A.M.\\") to produced, electric alternative (\\"Summer Teeth\\").  He has also combined with Billy Bragg to do two great Americana records using formerly-unseen Woody Guthrie lyrics (\\"Mermaid Avenue I & II\\"). Tweedy's latest offering with Wilco continues his evolution. The  melodies are fragile, fitting Tweedy's tender, raspy vocals, and the sound is closest to \\"Summer Teeth\\" (but sometimes a bit more stripped-down, as on the great \\"Pot Kettle Black\\"). For...giggles, Tweedy even threw in a little Neil Young guitar fuzz (\\"I'm the Man Who Loves You\\"). The lyrics are introspective, touching on life on the outskirts of fame (\\"all my lies are always wishes,\\" \\"every star is just a setting sun,\\" \\"every song's a comeback/every moment's a little bit later\\").  Wilco lost its label and its lead guitar and keyboard player while making this record - but it didn't matter. The band found a new label, and Tweedy doesn't need anybody else to make a great record. He can do it all himself.
B0000047CX|5.0|Yes, yes, yes. This record will get you laid, Shallow Hal. And for the not so shallow among you, this will not only lay you, it will make you levitate. Why? Cause this is bossa nova, this is muito natural. So there, invest in yourself and get this album.
B00005A1PR|4.0|This new CD from India Arie is wonderful!  She is a fresh breath of air in the music industry.  She brings her own touch and sound to her music, which makes it great to listen to.  It is not the generic R&amp;B, it does fit into any category.  The lyrics are something that we can all relate to, and they are inspiring.  I always feel better about myself after I listen to this CD.
B000002G6J|5.0|This record is fantastic, &quot;Wave&quot; is the standard to end all standards. Check out the Sinatra cover of that song, or the Oscar Peterson take, they BOTH rule, more proof of Jobim's universal appeal. And don't be believing those that say it's all overrated easy-listening or Muzak, this is the REALEST and COOLEST music ever. I used to be a big rock fan before Jobim. Real bossa nova! But the real gem in the album is &quot;Lamento&quot;, in which the great Antonio Carlos Brasileiro de Almeida Jobim sings and plays. Now THAT'S a showstopper! The lyrics, the music, Jobim's gravel voice, is all a study in contrast and it's all good! Can't say enough good things about this album, really.
B000002O3I|5.0|If you want to hear that low down, dirty, old school blues this album can't be beat. If you've ever wondered where wolfman Jack got that signature growl of a voice, its obvious, he copied the original, none other than Howlin' Wolf. I can't bring myself to pull this one out of the player, and when I roll down the streets of my town I know I got the real deal throwin' down.
B00005V0X5|4.0|When Dave Mustaine put Megadeth together after he was booted from Metallica, their debut \\"Killing is My Business...and Business is Good\\" was loud, violent, and an underneath it all middle finger to James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.  Of all the bands that put out remastered albums (Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Ozzy to name a few), it seems this time it has been done right.  Mustaine and Dave Ellefson have remixed \\"Killing is My Business\\" very meticulously, making it sound fresh and vibrant while adding a new dimension to a mediocre album.  Also included are several rough demos that show Mustaine's further disdain towards Metallica, including a cover of \\"These Boots\\" which is sadly without its profanity filled lyrics because of Lee Hazelwood rescinding the rights to the song, but it still has a rather darkly humerous quality to it.  The new album cover is lightyears beyond the original cover and is an overall good re-packaging deal.  ...[Guitarist] Scott Ian includes some written commentary as well, and Mustaine and Ellefson have presented track by track liner notes.  If you allready have the original, this reissue is worth a listen, but if you don't own the original then pick this up.
B00005QIPH|4.0|What to say that hasn't already been said? I agree with the people who say that these guys deserve all the hype that they got for this alblum. It's catchy and easy to listen to. I pop it in my player and a small, relaxed smile crosses my face. A good time if you are into simple yet smart music. A great time!
B000063USY|5.0|I think this movie rocks the house. Vin diseal rocks and paul walker does also. Get the movie
B00005MAM2|5.0|AKIRA is a graphic movie about the power of your own mind.  Tetsuo, a young biker punk tries to prove to older buddy Kaneda that he doesn't need a &quot;hero&quot;.  When captured by a government research facility, Testsuo is given a capsule that awakens the hidden powers that are so big, because of all the sycological drama he has delt with in his lifetime.  When his power rages out of controll, the phycic powers become too much for his body, and his entire body mutates into an infant-like blob.  <br />The ammount of detail and precision put into this movie is like none other, and that is partly to credit for its maraculus come-back since it's debut in 1988.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I really enjoy her music. All the songs on the CD are enjoyable to listen to with lots of emotion not only in her voice but in the music. The songs are not obnoxious or lude. I like the subjects and contents of the songs. The songs are rich and I find that they invoke emotions, memories, or day dreams to the rhythmn of the song. Thats why I rate this CD a 5. I wish she'd produce another albumn. My favorites on the albumn are My Lovers Gone, Isobel, and Take My Hand.
0441172717|1.0|Is this book boring or what? I got through the first 100 pages with great difficulty (it was hard  to keep from falling asleep) but it didn't get any better. So, I bagged it. I have no idea what the hype was about. I have enjoyed sci-fi and fantasy books before, so that wasn't the problem. It just happens to be a very tedious book.
B00003CWTI|5.0|I don't usually do movie reviews because I'm not a movie critic but I can say this: Magnolia is a masterpiece. I love ensemble pictures anyway and this is such: A collection of tragic lives...but it's not all sad. There's definitely some resolution in this film. The frog scene is the perfect catharsis to all of the misery, then comes the healing. All the performances are brilliant. The music is heavenly. The DVD has lots of little gems from the &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; empire (must-see, simply hilarious). The documentary of the making of Magnolia was fascinating to watch too. I always like to see what goes on in the filmmaking process. You get to see the actors being themselves too which is nice.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Yes she's beautiful and I would marry her in a second, but damn.  She's not a musician in the most stretched out form of the word, and hardly a good singer.  At best she's an entertainer doing other people's work and taking damn near all credit for it.  What happened to people writing their own music?  What's that--Britney tried to write a song but it didn't turn out too good?  Oh darn, let her struggle.  And her voice gets annoying if I hear more than one of her songs at a time.  Go get an appreciation for good music (i.e. jazz or classical or almost anything before 1980)...
B00005RY7X|5.0|I've heard everyone from the Smashing Pumpkins to the Strokes heralded as the \\"Saviors of Rock and Roll,\\" but that coveted moniker has never \\"stuck\\" to any one artist yet, and I doubt Andrew W.K. will be the exception.<br />His music is, however, a breath of fresh air in a genre crowded by Korn and NiN clones who think that the whole \\"rap-core\\" movement will replace real rock. After hearing so many vocally-challenged, angsty, no-talent hacks rapping badly and grinding thier own personal political axe to repititious and uninspired guitars, AWK's perfect fusion of Hard Rock and Metal will have you grinning madly, with phrases like \\"Let's get a party goin'\\" rising unbidden to your lips.<br />'I Get Wet' is a spectacular rebirth of something many have foolishly thought dead: honest-to-goodness head-banging; music to mosh, slam, stomp and beat your chest to. It's fun, plain and simple, suffused with powerful riffs and booming drums, catchy hooks and lyrics that encourage the listener to do one thing--and one thing only--party hard.<br />If you worry about whether or not this album is thought-provoking, relevant, or any of that other pretentious, pseudo-intellectual pap, this album is not for you.<br />But if the phrase \\"Let's Rock!\\" still means anything to you; if you want something that sounds great blasting out of your speakers; if you want something raw, primal, and unapolegetically happy to be alive, 'I Get Wet' will keep you partying till you puke.<br />Is Andrew the Savior of Rock? Who cares. It's a great stride in the right direction, and the first album in years that reminded me of why I love Rock in the first place.
0345440900|5.0|This book is a must-have for all expecting parents. It offers helpful advice so new parents don't start bad habits and end up feeling overwhelmed. After I read it, I tried some of the techniques, and they actually work. I buy this book for all of my friends who are expecting.
B00005QZWJ|3.0|I want to start out by saying that I got this cd the day it came out (being both a big Tolkien fan and a big soundtrack fan) and I wanted to get the *Limited Edition* because I thought I'd get something special out of it.  This *Limited Edition* is the same cd with a red leather case and a booklet w/ lyrics and more pictures (oh, and the actual cd artwork is different); no extra tracks or another cd with commentary, etc etc.  Hardly worth the price.  I take off one star for that.  <br />Musically, it is very appealing, with a lot of chorus used, a rich, full sound, and a lot of towering crescendo parts (I like that....).  Enya sung very beautifully in &quot;Aniron&quot; and &quot;May it Be,&quot; although it would have been even better for it to be a big collaboration between her and Howard Shore (like Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard).  Maybe for the Two Towers, Mr. Shore????<br />Now, the downside: although the underlying theme, most used in &quot;May it Be,&quot; is very good and is put to good use, the *main* 14-note theme is not that well thought out and doesn't seem to go with the rest of the cd.  The songs (excepting &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum&quot; and maybe one other) don't incorporate the main theme all that well, it just sorta sticks out like a sore thumb.  There's all these beautiful songs, and then, out of nowhere comes this 14-note theme that almost messes up the experience.  Whereas most movie scores are written with a theme in mind, this theme seems to be put in just as an afterthought to make is sound more *heroic* and adventuresome.  <br />It also never changes. Unlike the &quot;May it Be&quot; theme, which is modified several times, and played by different instruments, the main theme is always a trumpet solo, and it never changes tempo or the way it's played.  Very boring if you listen to it enough (scratch one star for that).  Still, even with that, it's a good score, very enjoyable (except for the main theme), and very memorable, and though I wouldn't go as far as calling it exceptional, I do consider it as one of the better scores that I have.  I would suggest, however, that you should get the regular soundtrack (unless you like to spend more money for a red leather case and a bigger booklet).<br />Favorite tracks:<BR>1. The Prophesy<BR>5. The Black Rider<BR>9. Many Meetings<BR>10. The Council of Elrond<BR>12. A Journey in the Dark<BR>17. The Breaking of the Fellowship<BR>18. May it Be
0743216385|4.0|BAND OF BROTHERS is about the close relationship of the soldiers who volunteered for Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. It follows them through Normandy, the Arnhem campaign in Holland, The Battle of The Bulge, and the capture of Berchtesgaden, Hitler's Eagle's Nest. I had previously read Ambrose's CITIZEN SOLDIERS, which had enough characters to make a Russian novelist proud. Like a journalist, Ambrose would fully identify a soldier the first time he's mentioned, then assume the reader knows whom he's talking about thereafter. With BAND OF BROTHERS there's more of a focus. Captain Herbert Sobel, the first C.O. of Easy Company gets a lot of attention. Sobel was a training officer, pretty much hated by the men. Lieutenant Richard Winters, who was cool under fire, is the exact opposite. Forty-seven years later he still receives letters from some of the regular troopers. Of the enlisted men, I found Pvt. David Webster the most intriguing. Before the war, he was a Harvard English Lit major. Ambrose uses the book he wrote about his war experience extensively.<br />  An especially interesting part of the book was the part about the troopers' relationships with French, Dutch, Belgium, and German civilians. Their attitude toward the Germans was rather surprising.<br />  Ambrose provides an epilogue where he details what became of the men after the war: An inordinate number of them became teachers or were involved in the construction trade. Several became millionaires. The most tragic case is that of First Sergeant Talbert, who never was able to shake the trauma of war.<br />  If you have as much respect for the soldiers who fought in WWII as I do, you will find BAND OF BROTHERS a compelling read.
0345451325|5.0|I think Halo is the best designed game ever even better than GTA3 for PS2.
0192833383|5.0|Just finished The Moonstone not five minuets ago. I am still reeling from the effect of its greatness! Really, how can anybody consider this novel tedious is beyond me, this is riveting stuff! What raises this novel above the level of all the other detective novels I have read, is the characterization. Wilkie Collins created a fascinating class of characters here. Usually in a detective novel the most interesting character is The Great Detective himself, in this role Mr. Collins gave us Sergeant Cuff, who reminds me a little of Inspector Poirot, but the novel does not revolve around him, it revolves around the Moonstone, and the events as seen from the point of view of several characters. Gabriel Betteredge, the sweet, quixotic house-steward being a particular favorite. The plot is complex and mystifying, the pacing is just right, the language is elegant and not at all difficult to read. If you have never read a classic before and would like to be able to boast of at least one title I'd say this is the one. You will have a ripping good time reading it too!
B00005YW4H|5.0|First of all anyone reading this should know that I am not a jazz fan -- in fact, far from it, preferring folk, Celtic, or Americana most of the time.  I heard &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; on the radio and was blown away. I listened to a few more song bytes online and rushed to my local music store, not willing to wait a moment longer to hear the total CD.  I was not disappointed, in fact, far from it.  It has been in constant play at both home and work since then.  I can't recall the last time I was so enamored of a voice and style like I have been of Norah Jones.  The cut &quot;Lone Star&quot; is much more country-sounding than jazz, and with her own take on the Hank Williams' tune &quot;Cold Cold Heart,&quot; I can understand why avid jazz fans may be disappointed in this CD.  If however you are a fan of such stylists as Van Morrison, and/or a fan of strong female voices, I believe you will be as enthralled with  this CD as I am.  I fully expect when next year's Grammy nominations come out to see the talented Norah Jones replace Alicia Keys as the Grammy darling.
B00005NW02|5.0|System of a Down is by far the best band on this planet. They have just released their mind blowing record, Toxicity. It features all the greatest songs on there like Toxicity, Forest, ATWA, Deer Dance, X, Chop Suey!, Shimmy, Science, Prison Song and many, many more! When I first got this album, I listened to it for the whole week without listening to any of my other CD's. This proves how good Toxicity is. Forest, Deer Dance, X and Toxicity are my favorite songs on there because they all have great drumming (every song has great drumming but these for songs are the best) so if you have found some money in your wallet, go out there and buy the powerful TOXICITY and experience the SYSTEM!!!

0385334206|5.0|I heard an anecdote about how, just after publication of this book, he received a fan letter from a 12 year old girl who asked him not to commit suicide. The thing is, he hadn't told anyone he'd be thinking about just that! Weird, huh? Or is that a testament to the strength and clarity of Vonnegut's themes? The saddest part is in the last few paragraphs. You can hear the author saying them to the reader, almost...It made ME cry anyway, but it was sort of a good thing.
B00005R8FI|4.0|This was a real gem back when it was first released. It still is. John Mayall, chose to do a kind of \\"unplugged\\" album, sans drums, progressive jazzy bass lines, a classical guitar, harmonica, steel string guitar... it was a cool, breezy sounding release.
038533348X|5.0|As a graduate of Catholic high school and UCLA, I read Cat's Cradle on my own in 10th Grade, and it changed/saved my life. Vonnegut's perspective is one of truth, and this fantastic fictional tale is a wonderful vehicle to enhance positive objectivity in the world. It resonates with the wholeness of the world, the role of a society and it's members, and the quirkyness of genius.
B00005JKED|4.0|I saw training day in the theaters the week of release, and loved it.It had s decent amount of action and denzel played a very good part, your never really sure if hes good or bad until the end.Im glad i saw it BEFORE he won his award, because if i did what almost all the people badmouthing this movie did and expect WONDERFUL acting and look and pry at the movie for plot holes i would never have enjoyed it.sure theres things that where not needed or things that didnt quite make sense but who cares, the story was good the movie was fun thats all that matters.Falling prey to any kind of hype can kill a movie experiance.Look at episode I, everyone expected THE BEST and when it wasnt the greatest thing they had ever seen...well the were dissapointed.Leave expectations of a Brilliant performance at the door and expect a courrupt police movie with good acting,action,and story and you will enjoy this movie.
B000000OSW|5.0|I'll admit it, I'm a fan of all of Peter Gabriel's work.  From Genesis to his solo work, I feel that Gabriel is one of the greatest artists of the rock and roll era.  His music is very distinctive, his lyrics often heart-wrenching and very, very human.  All of Peter's albums have their merits.  SO was, of course, his big commercial smash - and it was a great album.  Security was wonderful, with San Jacinto being one fo the greatest songs PG has written.  PG3 was revolutionary in its use of samples and textures.  Despite these great successes I don't feel that any of these albums is the equal of US.  US is an exploration of relationships with the focus on it falling apart.  It is akin to Dylan's Blood on the Tracks, Springsteen's Tunnel of Love, and U2's Achtung Baby in theme (and if you don't own all four of these albums, they are highly recommended).  All the great artists seem to put out \\"personal pain\\" records that reach startling heights - Gabriel is no different.<BR>There are many who discount US as an album.  I've done that myself in the past.  It's easy to get so caught up in the \\"big\\" songs of an artist that you forget they're not always his best.  When I compile a list of my favorite songs by PG I find that many of them come from this album.  Come Talk to Me, Only Us, Blood of Eden, Washing of the Water, Steam, Digging in the Dirt, Kiss that Frog, Love to be Loved (a bit repetitive, but very true), and the unrivaled Secret World.  There is a song for every emotion here.  Gabriel deals with the rough points of love and relationships throughout the record, although comic moments can also be found.  It's actually the more light-hearted moments that make this record great.  A lot of people want to dump all over Steam, but it's a song that really helps balance out the record.  It also happens to fit perfectly right next to Blood of Eden because it brings the more sexual aspect of relationships into focus.  Kiss That Frog also provides a bit of levity, but an enormous amount of insight can be found in the song.  All of the songs seem to indicate responsibility for the failure of the relationship rests upon both parties, and unfortunately Secret World doesn't leave the listener with much hope, but I see it more as a warning.  Be wary of building your relationships around fantasized ideals.  Both people are human and never will be perfect in this lifetime ..., but they must realize this and talk to work things out together.  Give this album a listen, you may learn a lot from it.  Also pick up the other albums mentioned, together they provide a wealth of insight into marriage that can't be found anywhere else.  Now we just must anxiously await for UP, Mr. Gabriel's next album.  ...
B00005QW4K|4.0|AOD is just an awesome movie.  But unfortunately the extras on the 'bootleg' edition disc weren't all that great. The worst part of this DVD is the \\"original\\" ending.  Would have been a better disc if they included the theatrical ending as an option.  If one thing this disc will make you realize why the ending was changed to cooler S Mart finale.
6305508550|4.0|From the opening scene, when Peter Gibbons's (Ron Livingston)freeway-jammed car is outpaced by an old man on a walker, to the Monday-morning showdown between Man and Copier, you know this is gonna be a good movie, and it doesn't disappoint. Anyone who has ever sat in a flourescent-lit cubicle listening to easy-listening music for hours at a stretch, week after week, with nothing to look forward to but more of the same until retirment (assuming you don't get downsized first) can relate to \\"Office Space\\" -- a surprisingly good first effort from Mike Judge, the guy who produced the lowest of the lowbrow, Beavis & Butt-Head, and later the more subtle \\"King of the Hill.\\" The performances are really good all around: Livingston is perfecto as office-shmoe Gibbons, a passive nice-guy programmer stuck in a boring, dead-end office job who has a revelation that sooner or later comes to everyone in a cube: we only have so much time on this earth, and we weren't meant to spend it this way. Shedding his passive ways, Gibbons rebels against evil boss Lumbergh (great performance by Gary Cole) and recruits two pals, the unfortunately named Michael Bolton (David Herman -- \\"Why should I change my name, he's the one that sucks!\\") and Samir, to help him loot his place of work of a few hundred grand in cash, and sets out to win the girl of his dreams (Jennifer Aniston). The soundtrack, mostly gangsta rap hits by the Geto Boys, is hilariously inappropriate for the setting -- but then again maybe not, since everyone that works at Initech is swallowing a lot of rage (there is a classic scene of skinny computer-nerd Bolton expertly rapping out the lyrics to \\"The Diary\\" by Scarface in his car). \\"Office Space\\" is a great commentary on the modern workplace, but it is also a (non-violent) revenge fantasy that will speak to anyone who has ever fantasized about smashing a copier with a baseball bat or telling the boss: \\"It's not that I'm lazy, it's just that I don't care.\\"
B00005OCMR|5.0|Yum! This film looks so good on digital I could lick the television screen! This is a rare case where I give a film five stars on its asthetics alone; the presentation is mind-boggling, and this film, at least technogically, was way ahead of its time. Both the subject-matter and the graphics could have come from a film of today; but only this is better than many of the graphics-oriented films of today, for this film is more unique in its art and has an engaging plot. <br />More than a display of digital wizardly, 'Tron' takes us into a world that we might just forget is an artificial world. 'Tron' makes its purview REAL to us, and that is the magic not only of motion pictures, but of a well-made film. I was sceptical of Disney films until I saw this on DVD, AND on a digital television- then I realized some Disney films do have incredible vision, however puerile. 'The Black Hole' is another example of a quality (and might I say courageous?) Disney film.<br />The RatMouse thus hereby recommends both 'Tron' and 'The Black Hole', especially, and perhaps only, on DVD. And please, don't forget to bring the snacks- cheeze bits, please.
B00005Y228|1.0|This album is too dancy and has no real passion. All of the songs are materialistic and mean nothing. I would advise you to listen to this during aerobic workouts, it does make you more energetic. Kylie is a little too old to be a pop princess. Sorry but Britney Spears already took over the pop world. I just think she'll be a one hit wonder with the catchy song &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot; and she'll be gone again like she did in the 80s. Its an okay (I'm really stretching it) album. It definitely won't last on the charts or in the US.
B000059XUO|5.0|I had never seen the crow before about 2 months ago.I had always heard from people that the 1st one was the best out of the 2(no one seems to know about salvation) so i decided to see it, i downloaded a 500meg file off the net sat back and watched probably one of the best movies i have seen in a LONG time.brandon lee plays a batman type hero, a vigilante but with a much darker side kind of a lethal enforcer( much like venom from the spiderman series).Out for revenge on those who killed him and his bride to be.He is ressurected by the power of a rather large crow and immortality is bestowed upon him.From there this great movie with a plot to match unfolds until the finale.Buy this movie you wont regret it.
0451191153|5.0|There was a time when the Fountainhead was required reading in many high schools, and in a large number of college architecture programs -- it still should be.  This is a book that should stay accessible in your home, and it is one that you will enjoy reading more than once.  Each time, you may see in it more than you did before and draw parallels to contemporary events, people, and ideas.  It is not surprising that political liberals tend to hate this book and the author.  The Fountainhead remains a refreshing and optimistic story that continues to inspire true free-thinkers.

6304080921|5.0|If like me, you are fascinated with the concept of time travel, you probably enjoy traditional science-fiction romances such as The Time Machine. But Twelve Monkeys takes a far more studious approach to time travel. Paradoxes and recursion are encountered, all within a framework of excitement and adventure.<br />The story deals with a post apocalypse world seeking to prevent the very trauma that created it. The clue to it all seems to be in the words Twelve Monkeys, but can Bruce Willis prevent the disaster in time? The screenplay is cleverly adapted by David & Janet Peoples from their own story and provides just the sort of large scale conceit that director Terry Gilliam needs to flourish. Gilliam's design trademarks vast sets with dirty industrial backdrops and dangerously cruel clinical environments permeate the feel of the film. Gilliam also coaxes great acting from his two male stars. Bruce Willis is so cool as the hero of the piece, despite being beaten and bruised for much of the story. Brad Pitt turns in one of his better performances as an apparently psychotic inmate in a mental institution, (has he been wrongly diagnosed?) and Madelaine Stowe is quite engaging as the psychiatrist who becomes an unlikely ally in Willis's quest.<br />A terrific film, and well up to the standard we have come to expect from Terry Gilliam.
B00005NOOH|5.0|The World at War was made back in 1973 and to this date stands alone untouched by any other contender. The sheer scale of the project alone defies belief, archive footage (many of which was un-seen since WW2) was collated from over 12 countries.<BR>The musical score and narration by Sir Laurence Olivier is second to none.<BR>The few complaints from American viewers about the lack of American involvement are totally unfounded. Every country is covered and since this is a British production you would expect there to be a saturation of the British involvement, this is not the case. Yes the island hopping in the Pacific is covered in one episode but so is the massive British campaign in the Western dessert. Had this been an American production the viewer would have had 26 episodes telling us that America won the war single handed and Britain and Allies &quot;helped out a bit&quot;.<BR>And NO America did not win the Battle of Britain.<BR>The inclusion of James Stewart on the &quot;Whirlwind&quot; episode was quite apt, Mr Stewart flew 25 daylight missions with the 8th Airforce.<BR>All round we have a stable telling of events from a world-wide background and not from just one point of view.<BR>The interviews add a face to the outstanding combat footage and &quot;Remember&quot; is as moving as any hollywood production.<BR>Quite simply no other production comes close to the horror and compassion. Unmissable viewing.

0788815490|4.0|'The Wings Of The Dove' is a marvel of modern literary adaptation.  Henry James novels are all difficult to film, but the late three masterpieces, of which 'Dove' is the first, with their agonising syntax hovering over their referents like timid vultures flying away before they feast, are surely impossible.  And a 'faithful' adaptation of this novel WOULD be impossible.  Late James doesn't tell stories, his books are about the act of reading and interpreting, about decentring familiar modes of narration, about the importance of the right word, and so are riven with gaps and ambiguity.  James was busy creating modernism and the literary 20th century; director Iain Softley and screenwriter Hossein Amini are obliged to create a traditional, coherent story in an accesible way for as big an audience as possible.  So where James hems and haws over what exactly is going on in a particular scene or dialogue, euphemises, defers, revokes, shifts, obscures, Softley and Amini have to make choices, have to say THIS definitely happened, and THIS as a result followed.  James purists no doubt shuddered at the wholesale reworking of episodes, the systematic miscasting, the rendering conventional and sentimental character motivation, and the dubious interpretation of key events.  And, it's true, watching it, the film seems less an adaptation of James than a hazy remembrance of it, or a persistant misreading.  The vast majority who haven't read the book will be grateful that Softley and Amini managed to create a coherent and consistent narrative out of such intractable material.  A 'faithful' 'Dove' would have been an unwieldy, unwatchable arty bore.<br />If you want to find Henry James, you don't look to his stories, but the way he tells them.  Within the limits set by the economic realities of modern film-making, it is in his mise-en-scene that Softley is most brilliantly Jamesian.  He manages to interweave an admirable amount of James' symbolic motifs to visualise thematic concerns- economics, water, heights etc.  The film is a goldmine of period detail - the early 20th century has been comparatively under-represented on film, and the various bibelots, vehicles and costumes on show are a constant delight.  But even when filming in real locations, Softley's compositions look deliberately artificial and stylised.  His deep-focus cinematography emphasises the objects and decor surrounding the characters, highlighting the way materialism, environment, culture and economic need alienates the characters from their emotional needs, as does the framing, 'boxing' characters, separating them from each other; proscenium arches stage the dramas of conflicting performances we're watching.  Costumes and decor don't just suggest a period effect, but create meaning(s) too.  James' famously shifting narration finds an equivalent in Softley's playing with point-of-view, alternating unmotivated, gliding, overhead tracks with ambivalent character viewpoints.  Jamesian set-pieces aren't given the slow-burning effect they need in this disarmingly brisk film, but the Venice sequences are suitably enigmatic, in particular a haunting, nocturnal gondola ride.  In other words, although forced to show more than James ever would, Softley preserves the author's sense of a whole other world of feeling beyond or beneath the text, upholding James' irresolution and openness to the very tense end.  Amini even daringly rewrites James, trasposing the title and its symbolic diffusion from the sickly, saintly Milly to Merton and, especially, to the gaunt, aquiline Kate and her plumed hats.  <br />If 'Dove' doesn't quite soar to the heights of the very great adaptations of modernist literature (Visconti's 'Death In Venice', Ruiz's 'Time Regained'), than that's a part of its integrity; its relentless narrowing of focus and viewpoint, and unromantic observing are wholly true to its begettor.<br />(The shimmering DVD transfer is even more beautiful than the cinema release I saw, butthe accompanying features (especially the chapter selections) are unhelpful)
B00005QEO2|4.0|Listening to this disc, my mind drifts back to a Saturday evening at a small bar not far from home.  As we were getting ready to leave, the bartender talked us into another pitcher, telling us something big was happening.  That something turned out to be a visit by Aerosmith.  This was an album or two after Rocks, when the band wasn't getting along so well.  We waited, then our jaws hit the floor when Tyler and Perry walked in.  They were playing as a present to the bar owner, a friend of theirs.  The show started out very well, but degenerated into just another drunken bar band that played too loud.  We walked out and I was thinking that Aerosmith was on their way out.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  They just needed a break.<br />I bought all of the old Aerosmith albums before their resurgence, but have been selective since then.  So this compilation allowed me to fill in some gaps from the later CDs that I didn't really want to buy.  Plus there are some rare songs in here to help spice up the deal.  I'd really give it 3.5 stars if I could, because there's more here than I need.  Trimming this down to one disc would have made it much better.<br />The sound quality is very good to excellent and the liner notes are well done.  In summary, a good compilation for us old 70's dinosaurs that want to fill in the newer tunes from a very durable band.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Fantasia, crafted via Disney Studio hand-painting in the late 30s, is the first real video and the best. Period. <br />The visual themes are far more logical than the PC pablum of Fantasia 2000, and the art -- not being computer-derived -- is far superior. Mind you, Fantasia 2000 is a good work. But I am the first of three generations in my family to have seen both productions and all three of us are of like mind.<br />I saw it first when I was eight and never forgot it. My 32-year-old saw Fantasia in Ann Arbor when she was four and made sure her son saw it by the time he was six. All of us agree the original sets the class by which one measures the second (and all others) and against which the second (an all others) simply doesn't measure up. It is a pure, incomparable, thrilling visual and aural treasure of Western culture.<br />By all means, show your kids Fantasia 2000. <br />But keep the original for your kids to view at least once a year. In years to come, they'll be back with your grandkids to repeat that defining wonderful childhood experience.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Britney did a good job with this CD. But there is 3 song's I don't like on this CD and they are, Oops!, Girl In The Mirror, and Dear Diary. I got the European Version of this CD from my online friend from Germany, and I like it alot. Except for those 3 songs that I mentioned. Dear Diary makes me sick, I dunno why. She starts out with say \\"Dear Diary, Today I saw a boy!\\" That is blah, argh. And the song was written by Britney Spears (Of Course!), you can tell cos it's cursive in the booklet with the lyrics to the song and it says her name beside that song in the booklet, too. But the rest of the CD is great... My dream is to become a singer when I am older, but not one like Britney or Christina Aguilera. A singer like J.LO (Jennifer Lopez!). Well anyways, I used to not also like When Your Eyes Say It song but now I do. IT's one of my favorites. Below is my review of the tracks: I hope it's helpful!*!!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!<br />1. Oops!... I Did It Again - This track is yuck. I can't stand the title track!<br />2. Stronger - This song is a fast upbeat song, one of my favs!<br />3. Don't Go Knockin' At My Door - This song is okay!<br />4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction - Don't think Britney is trying to sound gross by saying I Can't Get No Uuh Satisfaction, it is just a song. It's good!<br />5. Don't Let Me Be The Last 2 Know - A favorite! Beautiful song!<br />6. What You See Is What You Get - This song sounds like Oops! I don't like it much but it's okay! I guess*<br />7. Lucky - A favorite, but why does Britney play Lucky in the music video when she sings the song??<br />8. 1 Kiss From You - Great song!<br />9. Where Are you now - Lovely!<br />10. Can't Make You Love me - I luv this song!<br />11. When Your Eyes Say It - I luv this song, it's another favorite!<br />12. (Extra Track) Girl In The Mirror - Yuck, she always talks about herself in some of her music.<br />13. Dear Diary - Blah Blah, boy boy. Yuck!<br />Overall grade - 97 %! This CD is very great over those other 3 tracks that I don't like should be deleted. Well still you must buy this CD today, if you luv Britney. If you don't then don't even bother to buy it. Cos those for who say Britney music stinks, it doesn't. 4 me i just like her music!*!*! I got this CD for my bday last year from my online friend from Germany, like I said this before. And I luv it:-) Britney is koolie singer=)!*!
B00005RIKD|5.0|Maturity. That's the first word that comes to my mind when I hear this masterpiece.  Sting has turned into an artist that doesn't need advertising acrobatics...<br /> For those unfaithful who don't understand this recording -one of the most elegant performed by Sting-, let's say, this musician knows who he is and the place he has occupied in the history of pop music.<br />  One of the most incredible things about Sting is his ability to re-invent himself... you will have troubles to recognize some of his new versions, and still, you'll be delighted.  I read a review by another person saying that he was dissapointed about this new versions... but, do you want them to sound like the original versions? well, go listen to the original albums.  As a musician, I know Sting just wanted to give them a new treatment, a new feeling... and he succeeded.  And his voice... better that ever.  He even had the chance to play with it... (did you catch his Louis Armstrong imitation?).<br /> Is it necessary to mention the quality of the musicians that played with him? I don't think so.. It's a normal thing in a Sting album.<br /> Even if you are not a fan of Sting, go and buy this masterpiece.  It's an intimate and delicate gift to us from a living legend.  Just a preview of what's coming in the future.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco does rock a favor by putting out this incredible masterpiece of music making.  The song 'Pot Kettle Black' makes you want to get up and dance, while 'Reservations' flows over you like warm water.  The songs can stand alone, but experiencing the whole album at once, you're taken on a wonderful ride full of new rhythms and melodies.  Kudos to the group for giving us something different and exciting to listen to.
B00004Y2QT|5.0|This is the funkiest Prince concert ever!!  Let me get my one criticism out of the way, it's the crowd, at times they act like they aren't in to the music and Prince has to pursuade them to participate!!  I couldn't understand this reaction because Prince and his band play some of the funkiest music you could ever want to hear!!<BR>     You don't hear this kind of funk from the youngsters of today, I doubt if they know what the funk really is!!  Get this concert if you love bass thumpin, horn driven funky music!!
B00005R87Q|1.0|what do i think of this movie? see my title. i would give it 0 stars if that was an option. I've seen better movies on CD's (for anyone that doesn't understand what i'm saying, there are no movies on CDs, so let me spell it out, it's not worth seeing. twiddle your thumbs, it's more fun and enjoyable.
B00005R1N3|5.0|I'm old enough to remember when Black Christmas first came out in 1974.It caused quite a stir with the young people.As a child then....I'm 34 now....I'd heard about it's shocking elements like this chiller's  scene where the housemother is pulled off a ladder by a hook and rope that lifts her out of the view of the audience never to be seen alive again or when the murdered child is found in the park by the search party.As a fan of well made horror films,I'm very surprised that this went out of print because it is an excellent chiller that puts films like Scream and it's sequels to shame.Until I found this classic for sale on Amazon.Com(I spent several years trying to find it)...searching for it in videostores was a lost cause.This like Psycho and the original Halloween is a groundbreaking film in the madkiller genre.Ironically enough I found this gem shortly before this last Xmas and although I'd never seen it,but I'd long heard about it's very effective elements and plot that have been overused by other horror films with a great degree of nonsuccess.I had never seen this film but had heard about it for so long that I felt it was a lucrative investment. When it came and I finally watched this film I knew that I'd made a winning choice.As I watched this movie from 1974,I kept saying to myself\\"I've never seen anything like this movie!\\"It has long been out of print and overlooked by too many people because the folk that love a good fright film would love this classic.This movie was made in Canada by Bob Clark and it stars Olivia Hussey,Keir Dullea,Margot Kidder and John Saxon.How ironic that Bob Clark would make the ultimate Xmas chiller(the killer is'nt dressed as Santa Claus as or any other holiday character for that matter) would also go on to make a classic Xmas family film called A Christmas Story....that's versatility!By the way,this is scary movie and it still has all it's power in 2002!
B00000DLUV|5.0|Considering that I am a huge fan of the Bee Gees, my opinion of this album may be considered biased. I would not, however, be a fan if it wasn't for this One Night Only concert. I'm 14, and around the time that this first came out, I had been fooled into believing that boy bands and all the other top 40 artists made good records. Boy, was I mislead! From the minute that I heard the incredible harmonies in such songs as \\"To Love Somebody\\" and \\"Nights on Broadway\\", and the awesome lyrics and melody lines on tracks like \\"I Started A Joke\\" and \\"How Deep Is Your Love\\", I was hooked! The Bee Gees work in music is BRILLIANT. This only showcases the immense talent of the Brothers Gibb that has made them one of the greatest songwriting teams of all time, and one of the most enduring acts of all time. Even if you're not a fan, give this album a listen. Maybe you'll discover that you have a new favorite band. I did.
B000002WU9|5.0|Bought this CD when it first came out, too bad it took me so long to finally to give it the props on Amazon that it is long over due.  Man, this album is just \\"SICK\\"!!!!!!  Take my word, if you love RAP, then you must own this.  JUST GET IT!!!!!!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco went through a lot to get this thing out there.  Thankfully we don't have to do that much to pick it up.  I've been a fan of Jeff Tweedy since Uncle Tupelo, so I'm quite biased, but I find the album to be expansive and daring.  While track 7 overtly poppy and fun &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; is receiving early air-play in the Minneapolis market, it is not the best track YHF has to offer.  If you are new to Wilco, I believe that track 6 &quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot; and track 9 &quot;Pot Kettle Black&quot; are great places to start on this album.  If not new, just put the disc in and press play and enjoy.  <br />I believe that this is Wilco's best work to date.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot seems to be part of an evolution that is easier to see in hind sight.  Elements of &quot;Misunderstood&quot; &amp; &quot;Red-Eyed and Blue&quot; can be heard in the album along with some of the more obvious elements from &quot;SummerTeeth.&quot;  While it is hard to articulate, as a fan I think that Wilco is producing some very important music for our time.  The importance is that Wilco focuses on the power of the song and the importance of songwriting and construction, rather than the packaged, prefabricated dance moves that are dominating TRL and record execs dreams.<br />As a side note, the piling-on of Reprise by critics is quite entertaining.  The fact that AOL-Time/Warner paid for this twice is laughable when business decisions are made that are supposed to realize &quot;economies of scale.&quot;  Because Wilco were such great sports in making the album accessible on their website in the wake of the Reprise fallout, I highly recommend buying the album. e are dealing with art and not science.  When all is said and done Nonesuch and AOL-Time/Warner are going to be quite happy with keeping Wilco in the stable.  Which leads me to a jaded question, was the Reprise episode real or was it great marketing hype for the parent company?  Don't ponder too long, just take 52 minutes out of your day and start listening.<br />Matt<BR>Minneapolis
B00005YXZH|5.0|I can say with complete confidence that Wilco's long delayed \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is the best and most vital album to be released this year. This is a watershed album, the sound of a group finally finding its voice. I first came to Wilco last year by listening to thier wonderful collaboration with British folkie Billy Bragg, \\"Mermaid Avenue\\". Since then, I've become familiar with all thier fabulous material. From album to album, Wilco has been slowly building up to YHF. <BR>Like Radiohead's smashing OK Computer, this is an album that you may find jarring to listen to at first, but after a few spins through it, it slowly reveals itself to you. This is a beautiful and bold statement, a true American work of art. <BR>From its stunning arrhythmic opener \\"I've Been Trying to Break Your Heart\\" to the final sounds of dissonance that ends the album this is a jaw dropper. Much is being made on how timely the album is. Although Wilco recorded this long before last September, Yankee Hotel is almost prophetic. The lyrics, music and sounds capture a mood of high anxiety, sadness and lost innocence. It's a complex album, meant to be listened to in its entirety. The pains that Wilco had to go through with their label to get this released is truly a sad statement about the American music industry, but thankfully, Wilco won out. What an album!! (NOTE: Do seek out everything else by the band as well as Tweedy's first group, the legendary Uncle Tupelo, GREAT stuff!!)
B000001FNL|5.0|Main Course is the ultimate pre-Saturday Night Fever Bee Gees album. EVERY song is fantastic. I'm only 14, but I can easily see why the music of the Bee Gees was and still is so popular. \\"Nights on Broadway\\" is, to me, the attention getter of the album. The synth work on the song is great. The harmonies during the bridge are awesome and Barry's falsetto adlibs at the end bring the song to life. \\"Jive Talkin\\" is a CLASSIC! As a young music lover, I have been forced into believing that all disco music is cheesy and stupid. If songs like \\"Jive Talkin\\" are considered disco, then I love it! (Although \\"Jive Talkin\\" sounds more along the lines of 70's R&B.) \\"Fanny\\" (my favorite from the album, and of all time) is R&B BRILLIANCE!!! Should've been a number one, but it wasn't. The bass work and the harmonies are fantastic!! I love Barry's smooth, non-falsetto lead vocal. \\"Songbird\\" is a very inspirational track. Listen to it when you're down, and you'll be happy in no time. \\"Wind of Change\\" and the raunchy \\"All This Making Love\\" are very catchy tunes. \\"Come on Over\\" (eventually recorded by Olivia Newton John) and \\"Country Lanes\\" are the two country tracks on the album. They are great songs and they add a wonderful variety to the album. \\"Edge of the Universe\\" and \\"Baby as You Turn Away\\" are excellent songs to close out with. Barry's first falsetto lead appears on \\"Baby as You Turn Away\\". Overall, this album is BRILLIANT! Buy it, you WILL NOT be disappointed.
B000059Z8M|2.0|This movie was had at best a decent story line and had a few funny scenes here and there.But even the funny scenes were boring and almost lame. Overall, this movie did absolutely nothing for me.
B00005ND42|5.0|Of all the recordings of Beethoven's sonatas for violin and piano, this is the one that gets it right.  The tone and clarity are perfect.  The balance between the instruments is ideal.  I've heard other more recent attempts in which the violin is either too quiet or has too much reverb, or the piano is too loud or too soft, but this recording is an optimal blend of sound and performance.  The texture is so immediate and real that you can almost feel the wood and ivory coming through your speakers.  Maybe it's because it's a German recording, I don't know, but these artists are Beethoven reincarnated.  I imagine that this is how the master would have wanted to hear it.  It's simply beautiful.
B00003CXA4|2.0|While 'Gandhi' the DVD is certainly one of the most visually beautiful packages I have ever seen, it is also a sad commentary on the ultimate impact this movie has made on Western studios (read : nothing). The DVD comes in a see through white plastic case, with a clear band window running on either side. This lets us catch a glance of the real case cover, which has Gandhi in white, illuminated by the multitudes of men chanting beside him and around him. When you slip the case out of its' plastic holder, you are treated to the fuller version of the same picture, which, with the wonders of Adobe Photoshop, have rendered what was once just another studio shot of Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, into something far more magical and memorable.<br />All the details of the DVD are listed on the back of the white plastic case. The actual DVD case itself is in a wonderfully regal dark gold color, and the back picture is of the train sequence, with the words \\"Be the change you wish to see\\" beautifully etched across the skyline. Indeed, I have never come across a packaging for a disc that has so aptly captured the film's sentiment. On this front, I give the disc a full five stars.<br />However, the DVD itself smacks of hypocrisy. I find that everytime a reviewer gives this disc a low star rating due to the fact that the DVD blatantly insults the fact that Gandhi spoke Hindi and that all the main actors (save for Ben) were Indian, people are quick to claim that the review was 'not useful'. I am not sure why this is, but the truth is that this is very much an Indian film, with all the important roles played by Indian actors, and yet there is not ONE mention of ANY of their names on the DVD packaging. Candice Bergen, who appears for just eight minutes on screen, is given prime billing next to Ben Kingsley, while Rohini Hattangady, a beautiful Indian actress who plays the Mahatma's wife and was onscreen for most of the three hour film, is not mentioned even once on the DVD.<br />When you click on 'Cast and Crew', it is even more horrifying. Not even ONE of the actors mentioned are Indian. ALL of the actors listed are white. The great Alyque Padamsee who played Jinnah, the wonderful Roshan Seth who played Nehru, the incredibly talented Saeed Jaffrey who played Sardar Patel - all of them are not even mentioned ONCE. Considering that they appear throughout the film, this is a horrendous insult to the Indian film crew. However, consider it typical American studio idiocy, for Martin Sheen and Trevor Howard (both of whom pop up at the beginning and the next-to-end) get full page biographies and filmographies. This is intolerable.<br />This is especially disturbing, because this is exactly the sort of vapid Western-minded stupidity and xenophobia that Mahatma Gandhi fought against. Any self-respecting Indian would flush this occidental abomination down the drain. To add to the insult, the DVD does not even bother to mention that 'Gandhi' was shot simultaneously in English and Hindi. The Hindi version was the one released to millions of people in India, and the one that plays on Indian national television to this day. Considering that Gandhi spoke Hindi, and willfully strove to ignore English toward the most epic years of his life, the DVD literally slaps his message in the face by not including a Hindi language audio track. Yet, we get French and Spanish audio tracks, as if that were any consolation.<br />I was also dismayed and rather angered when I realized that there wasn't even a Hindi language subtitle option available. If the studio intended this as a DVD release for Caucasian audiences alone, I would understand. But yet they include obscure subtitles such as Thai and Korean, which makes the whole thing even more perplexing.<br />In the end, I think the 'Gandhi' DVD is a perfect example of how one should not judge a book by its' cover. This DVD is a glorious example of Western corporate ignorance and greed, and how the most beautiful cinematic achievements can die a gruesome death when handed over to the studios they were made under. I personally call for a boycott of this DVD until serious repairs are made. And if you're really interested in watching this film as it was intended, try to get your hands on the original Hindi version of the movie with English subtitles. That is the only version the poor Indian woman working in the fields, for whom Gandhi fought for, has watched.ents can die a gruesome death when handed over to the studios they were made under. I personally call for a boycott of this DVD until serious repairs are made. And if you're really interested in watching this film as it was intended, try to get your hands on the original Hindi version of the movie with English subtitles. That is the only version the poor Indian woman working in the fields, for whom Gandhi fought for, has watched.

But, now I am so happy to say that I have it once again. If you are a true Michael Jackson fan, I suggest that you own Moonwalker. YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!!!!! one more thing..... Michael Jackson is sooooo hot in this video!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Alt-country... indie-pop... rock... who cares? THIS IS JUST GREAT MUSIC IN ANY GENRE! With so much emphasis on trying to catergorize todays music into groups of what the industry thinks people of different ages and nationalities want to listen to it's sure refreshing to know that there are bands that don't buy into that philosophy. Wilco apparently stuck to their guns in getting \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" released as originally intended and not succumbing to label pressures to be more accessible. And thank goodness for Wilco fans everywhere!! This is an album to cherish for all time. It is one of those recordings that will bring unlimited pleasure and reveal new aspects with each listen (particularly \\"I am trying to break your heart\\" and \\"Radio cure\\"). Jeff Tweedy is this generations Brian Wilson with his inate ability to create music with intricate melodies that are at times challenging but always fun to listen to and explore (\\"Kamera\\", War on war\\", \\"Poor places\\"). Tunes that will never grow tiresome, tunes that have great soundscapes with pop sensibilities (\\"Heavy metal drummer\\", \\"Pot kettle black\\"). I believed that Wilco's previous release \\"Summerteeth\\" could not be beat, but they have indeed equaled, if not surpassed that awesome C.D. Buy this and believe it for yourself!
B0000039PW|5.0|This album put Biggie on the map. Unbelievable, One More Chance, Big Poppa, and Juicy are classic club tracks. Machine Gun Funk and Gimme The Loot is straight gansta. Everyday Struggle and Suicidal thoughts are dark tales. This is a must buy!
B000005DQR|5.0|Since being a child in the 70's I've loved classic rock DRUM SOLOS although maybe not classic rock itself - this great CD satisfies my need to hear drum solos and with other good sounds added too, how can I go wrong?<br />Really, it's the beats - which sound like someone's hot older brother practising in the garage on a Sunday afternoon - which  make this album great for me.  Never would've noticed it or bought it otherwise, but very glad I did.
0684800713|4.0|Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises is a tragic, enteretaining and important story. The author captured the feelings of desperation, and hopelessnes that the author along with many other survivors of the trenches experienced after WWI. This book is, I believe, is especially important now as America embarks upon another war. We should read this and remember the devasting effects war can have on a generation of young people.<br />I also think that The Sun Also Rises, a timeless classic, no doubt.No other author could capture such a tragedy as elegently as hemmingway. But i think its a bit hard to follow, and understand easily. But this book contains good contents and good use of words.
0140186409|4.0|The Grapes of Wrath is one of the most informational and interesting books I have ever read.  It dates back to a time in which recent generations may not understand.  The 1930's were a difficult time for a lot of people.  The Joad family demonstrates the struggles of some of these people on their quest for life.<br />The main character in this book is Tom Joad.  He and his family leave their home in Oklahoma because they are pushed out by the banks and forced to move west.  Their journey is like no other as they struggle to stay on the road and find money for food.  Like the Joad's, thousands of other families are compelled to do the same.  These families move in hopes to find a better life.<br />The Grapes of Wrath is a one of a kind novel that widens a person's outlook on life.  It shows the audacity and strength of families that have nothing to rely on, except each other.  It demonstrates both sides of man; the cruelty and the love.  John Steinbeck has filled this book with unforgettable characters that can only be seen through the eyes of the reader.  The Grapes of Wrath is an outstanding book that brings to life the courage of mankind.

B00005YXZH|5.0|Is it possible for an album to completely change your state of mind?  If it is Wilco's YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT it is.  For Wilco's fourth album they once again change their sound, showing their vesatilty.  If you are looking for the alternative country sounds of their first and second albums, A.M. and BEING THERE, this is not the place to look (although I highly recommend Ryan Adams if that is what interests you).  Likewise this album doesn't contain the power pop of SUMMERTEETH.  It beautifully blends the pop sensability of SUMMERTEETH with the dark undertones of BEING THERE.  Like Radiohead's KID A, this album is more experimental than the band has ever been, and it comes out as a gorgeous example of their talents.  The tracks range from the Beatles-esque \\"I'm the Man Who Loves You,\\" to the more subdued \\"Radio Cure,\\" in which lead singer Jeff Tweedy sings, \\"Cheer up/Honey I hope you can/There is something wrong with me/My mind mind is filled with radio cures\\" with all the honesty he can muster, however he does not have to resort to using any gimmicks as many singers do when they convey such raw emotion. <BR>It is just a shame that one of America's greatest bands has to have such a hard time gettng their music heard.  This album has been finished for some time but the band's previous record label Reprise would not release the album stating that it is too \\"uncommercial.\\"  I only wish that the music industry could see that it is \\"uncommercial\\" projects such as this that are going to save the music industry.  With the \\"boy band\\" era dying, we can hope for a bright future on the horizon for music: with bands like Wilco and Radiohead exploring new territory, and old favorites like U2 and R.E.M. still producing albums that keep our feet planted in the tradion that is still necessary.  This album can not come recommended highly enough.  It will leave you wanting to explore the bands roots; and if you start listening with Tweedy's beginning band Uncle Tupelo, to Wilco's previous efforts, to their collaborations with Billy Bragg, you will not be dissapointed anywhere.
B000062TU2|5.0|I love this movie. The special effects are great. It's even better because all the actors are really British. I've love the way the directer stays true to the books. That is a plus for sure.
B00003CXCD|5.0|This is based on the VHS version of the movie \\"Roman Holiday\\" played by Audrey Hupburn and Gregory Peck.  Story is simple and elegant.  A newsman (Peck) accidently come across a drug-influenced certain Eastern European princess (Hepburn) who escaped from her resident Palace while on her official visit to Rome, the story was evolved around the couple , the camera friend of Peck, the Security guards who were desperately trying to get her back to Palace, and Peck's boss and the neighboring landlord.  It is refreshing to see Peck / Hepburn's affectionate but innocent love affair after you have seen so many one-night-stand affairs in today's movies.  Superb performance by both.  This movie has brought Hepburn to super Stardom.  Alas, they don't make movie like this any more.  We don't have actor / actress like Peck and Hepburn neither.  A movie you must see and appreciate.

B00005YXZH|5.0|Four records in and we find wilco further yet from their freshman effort, A.M. First off, at this point in their career to call Wilco alt-country is akin to calling Donna Summers heavy metal. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot takes the listener on an existentialist trip, with the band creating a loose sonic meditiation on distance and love, using random radio signals as a metaphor. This isn't to say that it isn't fun as well - afterall, anyone who's ever seen Wilco live knows that they are spry and playful onstage - and they can rock out with the best of them. With songs like Kamera, War on War, Heavy Metal Drummer (a beautiful ode to youth, innocence and Ray Davies), I'm the man Who Loves You, and Pot Kettle Black, Tweedy and Co. provide enough radio-friendly pop to make you scratch your head at the Reprise execs who said this record was a \\"career-ender\\". The world would be a better place if War On War and I'm the Man Who Loves You were booming out of car stereos this summer. That said, this album is chock full of darkness and weirdness as well. Kicking off with \\"I am Trying to Break your Heart\\" lyricist Jeff Tweedy takes a haiku-like approach to describing drunken lovesickness. Yeah. And Radio Cure reminds me of noneother than Radiohead, its glum, moody, intriguing and ultimately cathartic. Jesus, Etc. has a great rolling feel accented by a slippery fiddle line and strings that hum out of nowhere and nearly assure that this will lodge in your ears and remain there for a very long time. Ashes of American Flags might make you shiver, its a cold poem on the state of affairs out here in the west. Reservations ends the album eloquenly, gorgeously, and ultimately grounds an album that is dissecting untruths, misundersatandings and miscommunication with one important truth. You have to get there through the album to truly appreciate it. What links the songs is a sonic pallette full of blips, radio pops stops and starts, guitars, horns strings, all forms of odd sounds and fillers pushed through filters, a rhythmic complexity never achieved on a Wilco record, and the poetry, which is VERY non-linear and disassociative, but, taken as a whole, beautiful and imbued with a codified consistency. Its an experience. Its a band that is changing, both in personnel and sound. Its an experience. Its a leap of faith. Take it with them.
B000062TU1|5.0|First off, I am a thirty year old male with three children. When this movie was first released I had no idea who Harry Potter was, but my kids were very excited. When I took them to see it I was totally impressed, so much so I went out and bought all four books to read for myself.<br />Now second, all this negative feedback about the movie compared to the book has got to stop. You have to realize that the film makers have to take a four hundred page book and reduce it into a two hour movie. They do not have the time to go into all the detail of the characters background. When was the last time any of you have seen a movie, based on a book, be 100% right on. Let me answer this. NEVER.<br />Thank You.
B000002GYW|4.0|i consider this to be the best eagles record.being a flying burrito brothers fan i love the early eagles albums primarily for the bernie leadon compositions and his great harmony and instrumental work.the song doolin dalton is great and really sets the mood for the rest of the album.twenty-one is foot-stompin bernie leadon compostion which has some great acoustic guitar and banjo.tequila sunrise suffers from overplay on the radio but is a good song as well.i've never really liked desperado too much,but it does suit the record.certain kind of fool features the unique vocals of randy meisner and gives the album a shot in the arm after some mellow numbers.the album peaks with one of my favorite song of all time,outlaw man. a cover of a song by david blue is the eagles at their best,a mixture of hard rock and country.glenn frey vocals are incredible and bernie leadons heavy guitar riff tops it all off...\\"a life upon the road is the life of an outlaw\\", hey what more needs to be said.the last real good song on the album is called bitter creek.a bernie leadon song in an alternate tuning with some really great harmonies and bernie's characteristic straight ahead vocal style.this is a truly great albums and is a must for any fan of early seventies country rock.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I won't go off on the same thing that everyone who owns this album says about it.  Sure, it's good.  Sure, it took Wilco a war and a half just to get it released.  <br />But there must be an even better reason, right?<br />I think there is.  The reason the album has an overall 4* is because certain people just chucked it into the Used CD bin.  They didn't give it a chance to sprout on them.  Those who could didn't let it get nominated for a single Grammy.  And it's their loss, because I have a hunch that in five or ten years the Second Coming of The Beatles and Pink Floyd is going to constantly point back to this one.<br />And we'll have been the ones who already knew the classic that it is; the lyrics, the astounding production, the musical force, the subtle but amazing hooks.  <br />This album is going to change a lot of things in the long run.  And that seems like a good enough reason to buy it to me.
0380715430|5.0|This book is a history of the English language, with particularly interesting chapters on the beginnings of language, wordplay, pronunciation, swearing, spelling, varieties, and just about everything you would ever want to know about our mother tongue. The only question I still have that Bryson was not able to answer was why was the language of the Angles adopted in England, rather than the language of the dominant group, the Saxons? Bryson says that we just don't know why.<br />I never thought a book on English (and languages, in general) would get me to laugh out loud, but this one did many times. For example, Bryson writes that \\"some languages have words that we may be pleased to do without,\\" such as the German word \\"schadenfreude\\" (which means \\"taking delight in the misfortune of others\\") or how about \\"sgiomlaireachd\\" (meaning \\"dropping in at mealtimes\\" in Scottish Gaelic)? The delight that Bryson takes in languages is, well, simply wonderful: He writes that strozzapreti is a pasta in Italy and means \\"strangled priests\\" and that vermicelli means \\"little worms.\\" Or how about that \\"A ydycg wedi talu a dodi eich tocyn yn y golwg?\\" is Welsh for \\"Did you remember to pay?\\" Bryson is also quick to give opinions, such as: \\"There is no logical reason not to split an infinitive\\" and \\"Sentences [can] end with a preposition.\\" Then he tell us the sources of these \\"dubious\\" strictures.<br />Bryson is intrigued about where English words come from, and they come from many other languages: Scandinavian (skull, leg, husband, rotten, their), Norman French (jury, traitor, marriage, govern), native American (\\"hoochinoo\\" became hooch!), Mexican-Spanish (rancher), German (dollar), etc. In fact, only about 1% of our words are Old English ones (but they include man, wife, and love) we discover. Where do our words come from? Well, about 1,700 were invented by Shakespeare alone, including the following words: critical, monumental, castigate, majestic, obscene, excellent, and lonely. Also quite interesting is how English words have changed in the last millennium: For example, to Chaucer a \\"girl\\" meant any young person, \\"brave\\" implied cowardice (which \\"bravado\\" still does), and that \\"knight\\" was pronounced something like \\"kuh-nee-guh-tuh.\\".  And new words keep coming (\\"apolitical\\" is only 50 years old)! And, of course, we learn that English has influenced other languages greatly: in China, conversations occur on the \\"te le fung,\\" a Ukrainian goes to the barber for a \\"herkot,\\" and a Japanese commuter is crammed into a subway car during \\"rushawa\\" (rush hour)!<br />And where else would I have discovered such facts as these?: that there are 176 names for dust balls under the bed; that there are 17 different pronunciations for the word \\"house\\" in Northern England; that there are no Chinese crossword puzzles (because there is no alphabet); that Kennedy means \\"ugly head\\" in Gaelic; that the Japanese, Malayans, and American Indians do not have have any swear words in their native languages; that an anagram for \\"The Morse Code\\" is \\"Here come dots\\"; that a couple of centuries ago, many words could be spelled two or more ways, but today there are only three such words in North America (ax/axe, gray/grey, and inquire/enquire); that the Pilgrims were among the first generation in England who said \\"has\\" rather than \\"hath\\" and \\"runs\\" instead of \\"runneth\\"; and that \\"O.K.\\" is \\"arguably America's single greatest gift to international discourse, able to serve as an adjective, verb, noun, interjection, and adverb,\\" with obscure origins that may be someone's initials (Martin Van Buren's nickname, \\"Old Kinderhook\\"), a popular snack (Orrins-Kendall crackers), or words in Finnish (\\"oikea\\"), Haitian (\\"Aux Cayes,\\" a source of rum), or Choctaw (\\"okeh\\"), or perhaps a contraction of \\"oll korrect\\" (which is how Andrew Jackson spelled this expression)!<br />This is a book to treasure!quite interesting is how English words have changed in the last millennium: For example, to Chaucer a \\"girl\\" meant any young person, \\"brave\\" implied cowardice (which \\"bravado\\" still does), and that \\"knight\\" was pronounced something like \\"kuh-nee-guh-tuh.\\".

0425098532|5.0|Agatha Christie is reknowned for creating apparently simple murder mysteries that unexpectedly twist for completely unexpected conclusions--and no where is this better seen than in SAD CYPRESS, a cleanly written tale about a romantic triangle that leads to murder with only one possible suspect.<br />The novel opens with Elinor Carlisle actually in the dock, accused of double murder in an effort to hold the affections of her distant cousin and fiance Roderick Welman. When called into the case by a local doctor, Hercule Poirot discovers that Elinor behaves exactly as if she is guilty of the crime.  Nonetheless, he agrees to investigate... and as Poirot works to uncover the truth, he finds that virtually everything about the crime indicates that Elinor did indeed commit the crimes--a circumstance which, almost perversely, makes him begin to question the guilt others have taken for granted.<br />This is one of Christie's least known but most effective novels, a work that deserves to be ranked with the likes of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, THE ABC MURDERS, and A MURDER IS ANNOUNCED. The characters are among her most vivid, the story has an unpretentious atmosphere, and the solution is both absolutely reasonable and absolutely unexpected. Christie writes with considerable clarity, and the simplicity of her approach makes the story all the more effective. An impressive work, sure to please both old fans and newcomers alike; recommended.
B000003S0F|3.0|Before any hardcore KCers lynch me, 3 stars isn't a BAD rating -- it's just smack in the middle.  It's the same grade I gave Brain Salad Surgery, which I like a lot but not enough to give a high grade to.  Three is good, four is excellent, five is flawless.  This is just a good album.<br />So where does this go wrong?  It's a very, VERY quiet and subdued record.  Its tempo never rises above a crawl, with a few exceptions (there are a few heavy parts on here, few and far between).  When I first heard this album, I thought it was one of the most boring I've ever heard.  Time has eased the pain a bit, but this is still by far Crimson's weakest effort (I'm one of the few who actually like Lizard).  However, with a lot of goodwill, patience, and repeated listens, Islands's sleepy, hypnotic charm gets to you.  With a few more listens, this grade would probably rise some because it's just that kind of record.  However, I have to force myself to listen to it, especially when it's sandwiched between Lizard and Larks' Tongues, two of my favorites.<br />So this isn't a BAD album, it's just not that good.  Perfectly acceptable, just smack in the middle.  So that's what this record gets.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Who's laughing now, Reprise?  Let's just hope Wilco earns 100 times as much as they spent in buying back their song rights.  Any summary I can give won't do this masterpiece justice, especially since the giddy word-of-mouth milieu surrounding YHF would have already convinced the curious fan to lend an ear by now.  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is a heartwrenching work I first heard in those numbing days following 9/11, and I suspected part of the album was recorded as mystified reaction (specifically, the brilliant 4-5-6 punch of &quot;War on War&quot; &quot;Jesus, Etc.&quot; and &quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot;).  In the end that wasn't the case, of course, but the temptation to draw eerie parallels is a testament to Jeff Tweedy's lyrical genius rather than my overactive imagination.             <br />There will be many summaries exploring the nuances of each song on YHF.  Lacking the eloquence to capture in words the sui generis phenomenon that is this album, I can only paraphrase Wittgenstein, poorly: &quot;Don't read, listen!&quot;  <br />And whoever at Reprise decided this album wasn't worth signing....are you the same person who decided to draft Sam Bowie ahead of Michael Jordan?
B00005614M|5.0|This band only played for a couple of weeks, and just a few tracks were recorded. Almost 10 years elapsed before these tracks were compiled in an LP for the first time. Neverthless, the music from those sessions is one of the greatest achievements in jazz. For Miles hardcore fans, every album is genious and essential and a cornerstone, but this one really is. And a good place to start a jazz or a Miles collection. The story of how the original master tapes were discovered almost 50 years after they were recorded only adds to the magic aurea surronding this CD. The other version available, `the complete birth of the cool' did not use the original master tapes, and therefore is inferior in sound quality, and its only for completists.
B000002UAO|5.0|I'll summarize the things that in my opinion make Rubber Soul what it is.<br />First, the simplicity of the sound. Yes! the simplicity. This is what I think is the most difficult thing to reach in any record. (Have somebody tried that recently?) The melodies here are so strong and the instrumentation in most cases i.e. 'The Word' is so basic that everything together makes it appear both sublime and simple. I haven't seen this effect in any other record and even other Beatles' records which may be superior in concepts or melodies (Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's, White album) don't have that effect.<br />Second, the vocals are just amazing. Just listen to the last part  of 'nowhere man' and realize how good McCartney's voice fits in Lennon's lines or better listen to 'If I needed someone', where a perfect balance between 3 voices is nothing less than perfect. Here, I think is the 'archeotype' (Sorry for the term) sound of rock: Lennon/McCartney&amp;Harrison harmony and Harrison's guitar riffs. This is the paradigm that many bands have tried to pursue with and without success.<br />Third, looking at all the Beatles' discography you realize that in this album the balance between McCartney and Lennon and an emerging Harrison is at its climax and it will be maintained until 1967, when McCartney assumed the leading role. Not very often three outstanding artists reach a perfect balance working together, but here by chance, destiny or whatever you want to call it that certainly happened.<br />Fourth, the songs of course! I only find that 'What goes on' is a little bit weak. 'Wait' could have been a bad song, but McCartney's wonderful part which reminds me his lines in 'A day in the life' makes it worth it. Although Lennon regretted 'Nowhere Man' it could be with 'In my life' and 'If I needed someone' the best track in the record. McCartney's songs are also strong, simple and effective. Even if you don't like 'Michelle' you have to admit that it is an amazing piece of work. 'I'm looking through you' is also outstanding, is he talking to Lennon in this track or is just my impression?. Harrison's guitar in 'Drive my car' and 'Run for your life' is impressive and being repetitive: simple too. I just realized I didn't mention 'Norwegian Wood' or 'Girl' what can you say about them, just listen to them!<br />This, I think summarizes why Rubber Soul is such a great piece of art, like a painting or a book if it's good and it is simple it will be outstanding and will change the world, and that's what actually happened; but for Rubber Soul the best is that nothing we say compares to the joy of listening to it.
B00005A1PR|4.0|Never mind that the Grammys didn't give her an award. India Arie Simpson is still a great performer/singer/songwriter. And her Acoustic Soul album is an impressive debut, and not because she writes and plays her own instrument. It's good because it touches on, get this, innovative subject matter. <br />\\"Video\\" best describes India.Arie's style: she's her own woman and will not fall victim to the materialization of other women. \\"Brown Skin\\" is a slow, sexy grind where she comments on her love of Black men. And \\"I See God in You\\" is an interesting ode to her man who has a lot of faith. But my favorite song is \\"Always in My Head\\" because the melody and the lyrics are, well, always in my head.<br />We know that India ain't no Aretha on the mic, but her production matches well with her vocals, even though the production may be too tame for those who want to get on the dance floor. Call this neo-soul, call this acoustic, call this R&B, call it folk, call it whatever. But just get Acoustic Soul and appreciate it.
B00003CXRM|4.0|Didnt think I would like this, but it was a very good movie.  We watched and enjoyed it as a family.  Not many movies these days that you can watch with your kids and then to have everyone like it besides.  It was funny and the music was excellent.  I also purchased the cd.
B0000399WI|4.0|A heart-warming prison drama set in the late 40's (but is in the 60's by the time it finishes), The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of a bank accountant sent to the Shawshank prison convicted of murdering his wife, wherein he meets Ellis Redding, a long time prison server whom he evetually strikes up a close friendship with. The film also briefly follows the experiences of other prisoners, representing the unfair treatment some recieve whilst in prison, cleverly allowing the film to expand on other issues apart from friendship.<br />Although the film unfolds at a slow pace, we are justly rewarded for our patience near the end when the film throws up one of the greatest twists in film history (don't worry I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it!) which makes the film worth watching for this part alone.<br />The Shawshank Redemption is successful (like so many other films and stories) because it focuses so well on the theme of friendship. When watching the film you long for yourself to have a friendship as strong and trusting as Andy and Ellis' to the point where one could say that you yourself would like to be in that prison (but do not be mistaken to think that the whole film glamourises prison, it can sometimes quite the opposite as some of the brtual and shocking scenes show). <br />However, and contrary to what many people say, the Shawshank Redemption is not an all-out masterpiece. It lacks that extra something, that extra bite that deprives it from being a complete masterpiece (but don't get me wrong, it's still head and shoulders above most of the nonsence released on the screens nowadays) but is an excellent film nonetheless.
B00005JKJA|2.0|I loved this film in the theatre. Actually, I hated it the first time, figured it out the second time, and loved the third viewing. So I was excited to hear it would be available on DVD so soon. I bought it the day it was released, raced home, got my wife and son tucked into bed, and sat down to watch it. NO CHAPTERS!!! Thanks a lot Universal. Come on, that is for cheap DVDs, not a great film from a reputable company. Its an art film. Why no commentary? Why no extras? Shame on you for taking advantage of the filmgoers who loved this film. This is a renter at best. Wait a few months for a deluxe edition that had better come out.<br />Steve
B00005YXZH|5.0|It is sad that this album was almost unreleased because it is REALLY GOOD.  This basically is Radiohead's Kid A, but with melodies and words that mean something.  It takes a few listens to get into it.  This is my first purchase of Wilco, I was tempted because I had read that their album was almost not released.  I became interested because most recently Dave Matthews Band's record company did not release their album and now it is going to be released this summer.  So it is safe to say that record companies don't know greatness.<BR>  With that said I can see why the company was hesitant to release &quot;Yankee Hotel foxtrot&quot; It has no real radio songs on it, except maybe for &quot;War on War.&quot;  But overall, this is right up there with Radiohead's 'Kid A' as one of the best albums to come out in the last five years.  I already have a spot saved for this album for my top 10 of 2002.  It's that good folks.
B00003CX5P|5.0|OK, so \\"The Phantom Menace\\" was not the best Star Wars movie or even close to it...but you've gotta give Lucas, the cast, and crew tons of credit for the effort. It's not really their fault that the media overhyped this movie and you can't expect them to live up to EVERY SINGLE PERSON's expectations--that would just go way overboard! If you were a true Star Wars fan, you'd love \\"The Phantom Menace\\" no matter what. I'm not trying to be an apologic fan, because this is just my personal opinion on living up to the hype. And just because this may not have been the best Star Wars movie ever, doesn't mean that you shouldn't see Episode II. I can assure you all that Episode II will be much different than Episode I. Everyone knows the story of Episode I so I do not have to go into great detail. What I will say though is that the acting by the cast was pretty fair--good acting in some cases, but other cast members faired worse. The special effects were absolutely incredible, and the storyline and dialouge were so-so. They had to make the dialouge kid-friendly because there was a kid starring in the movie...remember, don't expect little Anakin Skywalker to start acting and speaking like an adult! But now onto the DVD. You can't deny that this DVD is definitely one of the best DVDs out there. Hours and hours of special bonus features including interviews, CD-ROM extras, the making of \\"The Phantom Menace\\", music videos, teaser trailers, featurettes, behind-the-scenes, the making of the special effects, and a lot more. Plus, the picture quality and sound quality is outstanding! Yes, Jar Jar Binks was annoying...but he will be in Episode II a lot less. I think \\"The Phantom Menace\\" was a great addition to the Star Wars saga and I can't wait to see \\"Attack Of the Clones\\"...which I'm planning to see opening day. Buy this DVD and go see Episode II when it opens in theaters May 16th! (And don't believe all those so-called, angry fans who said this movie was bad)
B000056VJ7|5.0|I just bought Bat out of Hell two weeks ago and it is unbelievably awsome. I use to hear some of the songs on the radio but the album is meant to be listened to all the way through. There isn't one song on this album your going to skip. High energy songs like \\"Bat out of hell\\" and \\"Paradise by the Dashboard light\\" go way beyond the conventional verse, chorus, verse song formula. <BR> It amazes me that people either love this album or hate it. Common complaints are \\"It's excessive and typical of the late 70's\\" or \\"What kind of name is MeatLoaf?\\". First of all this album is not typical by any means. And it's not a product of the late 70's. Bat out of Hell is it's own baby. And as far as the name Meatloaf, I wouldn't care if he was called Spaghetti and Meatballs with an album this good. <BR> Today's music critics seem to be scared of big production, quality song writing, and quality musicianship, they think it's not \\"honest\\". This album was written back when music was accepted for being made simply for entertainment(and that's what this album is, entertaining). If you are concerned with whether or not this is a work of art, you may not enjoy it.(Although I think it is.)However, if you're like me and you like to just sit back and listen to quality music for the sake of music than you will love this album!
0684800713|4.0|Why didn't it take place there? GOSH!! I'm just kidding.<br />I thought The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway was an excellent story. Hemingway intergraded real life situations into the story making it easier for readers to relate to the book. Today there are people like Bill and Jake. Alcoholism is a big issue, just as it was then. Also, people still go traveling for leisure and partying to drink.<br />Today there are still expatriates. Maybe not as much in the book for the same reason -maybe there is-, but in a I can say that there are a lot of people today who do because their profession causes them a LOT of frustration. Hemingway way showed his point of view in destructiveness through drinking and sex.<BR>Which is the reason why I like the book. Hemingway wasn't afraid to write about what was going on in society then. <br />Another reason why I liked the Sun Also Rises is on how the relationships weren't clichéd. In the story, the characters constantly found themselves in doubt of one another. This can be found today, too. Is that person really my friend? Or are they just trying to be loyal? Does he/she like me? What signals are they sending me? <br />To sum it all up, it's a great book. You should read it.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|I am currently majoring in dance at a college here in Texas, and I would definitely reccomend this piece for anyone looking for interesting music for choreograpy.  It has a great range of dark emotions and very interesting sounds.  I also think the combination of electronics and strings might be more acceptable to professors who are a little conservative when it comes to electronic music.
B000002NFM|1.0|This album serves about as good an introduction to techno and electronic music as Vanilla Ice does to rap.
B00005YXZH|5.0|In a world where awards can't be bought by Pepsi or 14-year-old girls, this would be the record of the year. Passionate, inventive, and full of surprises, Wilco again transcends genres to deliver something completely fresh.
0446608955|5.0|This book made me cry. The movie made me cry. I cannot express how much this book touched my heart. I read it a year before the movie came out, and instantly fell in love with the characters. Sparks did such an amazing job shaping and adding depth to the characters.  Landon and Jamie, the main characters in the story, will surely touch your heart.<br />Basically the story is about bad-boy Landon, who falls in love with the most unpredictable girl - Jamie, the town's preacher's daughter. And don't think Landon \\"brings Jamie down.\\" Jamie changes Landon's life for the better, in beautiful ways. Through it all, Jamie's faith is alive and working in this story.<br />The couple face happiness, good times, and turmoil.  And yet, at the end, everything really comes together.<br />And guys, don't automatically assume the movie is a \\"chick-flick.\\" Almost every guy that watched the movie actually ADMITTED to getting teary-eyed. <br />This book and movie is for guys, girls, young and old, the hopeless romantics, and the ones who just want to be entertained with a work of art that doesn't rely on murder, sex, drugs, and sin to make it a hit. <BR>   <BR>3 words: READ THIS BOOK. And, SEE THE MOVIE. <BR>You will not regret it.
B00004TRD8|2.0|I simply don't understand why so many people think that T2 is better than the original! The special effects and style of the movie are exceptional, but beyond that this movie is completely inferior to The Terminator. The script simply stinks, with countless ridiculous one-liners and emotional statements by Arnold and John Conner that are laughable (e.g. \\"Now I know why humans cry.\\"). Sarah Connor is quite simply a TOTALLY DIFFERENT person than the Sarah Connor in The Terminator, which leaves absolutely nobody who the viewer can sympathize with. Getting back to Arnold Schwarzenegger, his acting in this movie is awful! Not once do you believe that he is really a futuristic cyborg with no human emotions whatsoever. Forget Titanic...THIS is the movie where James Cameron's talent took a nose-dive into mediocrity!!<br />Don't get me wrong. I appreciate great DVD packages, which Terminator 2:Judgment Day clearly is. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't deserve a DVD package this good. When you get down to it, it's nothing more than a B-Movie with a huge budget. Sound familiar? Do yourself a favour and get the original instead.
B000001IPL|5.0|I first bought Americana then i bought this cd and I am very impressed with Offsprings work so far.  Many people didn't like American, although I did, but I must say this is their best cd I've listened to in fact this is THE best cd I've listened to.  Let me say first that this is one of those cd's the first time you listen to it you only like 1 or 2 songs, but after listeneing a bit, you love every song.<BR>1. Time to Relax- 8/10 It's not really a song, but an introduction still gets you ready for the cd, and this does a good job at it, although i like the disclaimer from Ixnay better.<br />2.  Nitro (Youth Energy)- 8/10 this is a good way to start off an excellant album, it is fast, and good, but sounds like a bunch of there songs tend to do...but its still good<br />3.  Bad Habit-  10/10  This is just one of those songs, its simply aswome, this is the one that you and your buddies have fun singing even without the music, it just sticks in your brain.  Its the second best song on the album.<br />4. Gotta Get Away- 9/10 First, i had trouble writing a review to this song, cause as previewing the songs as i write this i didn't want to change from bad habit, if that tells you how good that song was.  Anyway on to this song, it starts ok, but I absoulutly LOVE this chorus, it makes the song worth listening to.<br />5.  Genocide-9/10  I love this song, it's really catchy, but like nitro and gotta get away, you don't know what it is until the chorus.<br />6. Something to believe in- 7/10-  This song isn't just an okay song, it is just in comparison to the rest the album it isn't the best.<br />7.  Come out and play-8.5/10-  Like Pretty Fly on americana, this is a really catchy, song, and the first i heard off Smash, and I still sing to this song, it is just so frickn' easy to sing along with.<br />8.  Self Asteem- 8.5/10- Like all the other songs on this album this is a great song, the problem is you'll probly, if your like me, get a little tired of it after awhile.<br />9. It'll be a long time-9.5/10 Ahhh this is my 3rd favorite song on the album.<br />10. Killboy powerhead-7/10 Its a good song dont get me wrong, it just sounds too much the same.<br />11.  What happened to you?-  8.5/10 this is the last song i expected to hear on this album, it doesnt make it bad, it is just...interesting, its ska, i just didnt see offspring doing ska, its like Why dont you get a job only more upbeat.<br />12.  So Alone 7/10- this is another one of those songs, its okay, but it doesnt do anything to distinguise itself from the rest of the album<br />13.Not the one 9.5/10 I really like song, it makes me play air guitar believe it or not, the guitar in this is just so catchy<br />14.Smash 10/10- THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM best song of theirs i have heard in fact<br />I tried to explain this the best i could, but its one of those things the better way to decide is to listen to the clips and decide for youself, and if you decide to get it...ENJOY
B000001DYA|5.0|In the sixties, I had a tendency to pick up albums based on the photo of the band, not what I thought I knew about their music. I pretty much hated pop music so looked for the underground bands. The longer the hair, the uglier they were, the weirdest dressed, that was my incentive. Blue Cheer had very long hair, there was only three of them, and I heard Summertime Blues on the radio. Bringing that album home, I eagerly put it on my mono record player and was shocked. If there was a way to blow the tiny little speaker out of that record player and hit me in the face, this album was the one to do it.<br />Picture three little guys walking out on stage in front of a wall of Marshall amplifiers (they were not actually little, it just seemed that way in front of those Marshalls). What was then mind numbing volume pounded into your whole body as they played through six songs that were crude, nasty, and so different from the peace and love [stuff] of the time it made your head spin. That impression is what hit me in the head as it came out of that little record player.<br />Blue Cheer were groundbreakers for the time. To me they are the first-ever heavy metal band. When you put them up against other trios of the time like Hendrix and Cream, there was no comparison. Their loud and nasty sound corrupted my musical tastes forever and at fifty years old, I still listen to heavy metal.<br />As a guitar player, Leigh Stephens became my hero (over Hendrix and others) and I tried to play every song note for note and came close but am not good enough to play them exactly. I still play Rock Me Baby, Summertime Blues, and Doctor Please regularly.<br />Blue Cheer slapped blues in the face and created a new sound that has progressed into many new forms. Outside/Inside was similar but too refined in comparison. Soon afterwards, Leigh Stephens left the band. Subsequent albums by them completely changed their direction but this first disk is a classic. For any fan of heavy music, it is a required listen.required listen.
B000059HAI|5.0|Unlike recent re-tellings of the events of Pearl Harbor, this one hits the spot for me. It doesn't waste time on sub-plots, or on cheesy love stories - rather it properly gets to the events of that fateful event in history, and retells them in the proper way, with respect for both sides and for the soldiers involved.<br />Granted the battle itself was not as nearly impressive as the 40+ min show of FX in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, but for the time period that this film was made in, it was impressive indeed. This movie, unlike &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, had a coherent idea of what it was gonna be - a war movie - not an overpriced, over Fx'd, muddled story with the events of 12/7/1941 as a backdrop. This movie respects the history of the events of that fateful day.<br />It's a war movie, plain and simple, without the Hollywood fluff....
B000002HAJ|5.0|\\"Wish\\" follows \\"Disintegration\\" like a bright spring day follows a sullen rainstorm. The songs on this album are well-worked Cure-isms that reflect love, loss, want, and the ever-present regret that Robert Smith does so exquisitely.<br />If \\"Disintegration\\" comes across as a drizzly, moody set (complete with dark cover art), \\"Wish\\" is the breeze-blown, almost-calm sea that rolls through each tune (water is the closest element that can capture the essence of the Cure's sound). There's a nice mix of tight, snappy songs (\\"High,\\" \\"Friday I'm in Love\\" and \\"Perfect Day\\") and more rambling stuff (\\"To Wish Impossible Things\\" and \\"Trust\\"), and the whole thing's not very long - a quality sometimes lacking in Cure albums.<br />Listeners should also try the live CD \\"Show\\" for some \\"Wish\\" tracks; the band registers a very tight set.
0140177396|5.0|John Stienbeck's novel, Of Mice and Men, grabs the reader's attention from the opening scene and does not let go of it until the last page. I usually do not enjoy reading, but this book was able to keep me interested and I actually read it in one sitting, this book is one that you really cannot put down once you pick it up. The simplistic storyline allows readers of all levels to enjoy the story and not get lost, yet is not too simple that the novelette becomes boring. <br />At the start of the novel, we are introduced to George and Lennie the novel's two main characters. They are fleeing from their former hometown because Lennie has gotten the duo into trouble again. It is not that Lennie is a troublesome character, as that he is unaware of his physical strength. This physical stature combined with his naïve nature, which is due to his mental disability, causes many problems for him and George. The two dream of owning their own ranch one day with many fields and rabbits for Lennie. To fulfill this dream they work on a ranch to earn and save money. While on the ranch Lennie is subjected to many awkward situations. George's loyalty to Lennie is often challenged by his friend's mishaps, he always remains true. Twisting the plot al the way to the end, Stienbeck creates a novelette that teaches us the meaning of a true friend. In enjoyed this book and you will too.
B00003CXI0|3.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: An amazing book!  Most of the country, and a large percent of the world has read it.  Perhaps thats what took away from the movie, that I knew what was around every corner.  Oh, its not that the actual movie is bad, its just that so many people are familiar with the story already that it doesn't really have the same affect as if you had never heard the plot before.  Using actual places, and incredible graphics to illistrate the story in a realistic way doesn't even begin to compare to our imagination.  If you haven't already seen it i suggest that you rent it first, because by the second time you see it there is no surprise.
B000059MEK|5.0|ok to start off, this is simply a wonderful albume. but its one of those cds like once you hear it, you love it or hate it. its a tad bit slower than &quot;homework&quot; but its still nice. this cd is disco-house/techno, so there are gonna be some disco tunes in here.   this cd starts out with the #1 dance song &quot;one more time&quot; and moves right into aerodynamic. digital love starts out good, then gets a little boring. harder, better, faster, stronger is the best use of voice voccoder i ever heard. it took me forever to finally learn the words. then crecendolls comes on and its an excellent party-dance song. nightvison is pretty, but slow. superheroes is a really neat song; with it satying &quot;love is in the air&quot; over and over and over. then the 2nd best dance song comes on &quot;high life&quot;, it really gets you dancing. the rest is all disco tunes thats really cool.
0141301139|1.0|I pre-read this book and I am glad I did.  I was really bothered that the mother animals were willing to lie down and die and have their children die rather than to try and escape - by helping \\"Mr. Fox\\" dig their way out.  I don't expect animal behavior to be realistic but this was ridiculous.  At the time I had another criticism of the book but I have forgotten it.
B000000WCV|5.0|to start off, buy this cd. you may have heard ppl talk about the discovery albume; daft punk running around in robot costumes, but thats another story. this is simply faster than discovery. the songs on &quot;homework&quot; are longer, more repetetive, and faster; though it is all house. you may think it sounds like disco, well your right. this albume is disco-house/techno, so if you live in a place where there are not that much techno, you will stand out (like me).   the best songs on this cd are: &quot;revelution 909&quot;, &quot;da funk&quot;, &quot;around the world&quot;, &quot;high fidelity&quot;, and &quot;burnin'&quot; &quot;around the world&quot; is an intense song; it says around the world for 7:00 so there is your warning. &quot;burnin'&quot; uses the same record scratch for 6:00. &quot;revelution 909&quot; uses the same bass bat for 5:00, and &quot;da funk&quot; uses the same scratch rhythem for 5:00.another good song is &quot;indo silver club&quot; its really good, like the rest.    so with all that said, make your own decision. my option would be buy it, if you, put it on the net for auctions :-)
B00005YXZH|5.0|Normally, I would not review an album on the day it was released, but I have been listening to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot for four months now after burning it off the internet.  For those of you who have been waiting for its release after much delay, do not fear:  it's worth the wait.  Wilco continue to evolve as a band with every album.  Jeff Tweedy's songwriting ability has grown considerably and he seems to have really found his own voice on YHF.  <BR>Although I recommend this album highly, beware that this album's subtle charms unravel themselves after repeated listens.  Tweedy's lyrics have become more abstract and the band uses more sound effects and white noise to complement their usual arrangements.  That's not to say that Wilco have gone and made an overly pretentious, arty record either- not by a long shot.  This album spreads its arms and invites you in like an old friend; it's just that some tracks will need some time to seep into your consciousness.  <BR>On their last album, Summerteeth, Wilco started to move away from just being an (excellent) alt.country, roots rock band and incorporating more elements into their music.  On YHF, they move further away from easy categorization.  Are they Americana, pop, avant garde?  Who cares, really.  I don't see them fitting into any radio format, but that's a good thing, right?<BR>The upbeat, more conventional songs, such as \\"Kamera,\\"War On War,\\" and \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\" will probably grab your ear first.  These are all, indeed, good, but my favorites ended up being some of the more moody, emotional tracks:  \\"Jesus, Etc.,\\" \\"Ashes of American Flags,\\" \\"I Am Trying To Break Your Heart.\\"  They all grow on you, especially Tweedy's lyrics, which have become more meaningful as they've become more abstract (no mean feat).  Example:  the first words sung on the album are \\"I am an American aquarium drinker.  I assassin down the avenue.\\"  While they don't exactly make linear sense, they work perfectly within the context of the song.  Other highlights include more standard fare such as \\"distance has no way of making love understandable,\\" which sums up well the album's themes of communication, love, and the distance between us all.<BR>This album is my favorite of the year so far.  Even though I have a pirated copy, I went and spent my money on the real thing today in support of the band.  I figured it was the least I could do as much as I've enjoyed this album.

B00005JKJA|5.0|First, let me get a message to you folks at home who want to go out and buy this DVD. DON'T! It is the worst DVD I have ever looked at. Know why? There are absolutely no scene selections! The entire film is just one chapter! Now, this would be simply nit-picking if this were any other movie, but Mulholland Drive requires the viewer to watch and rewatch many key scenes. Without a chapter selection, you might as well be watching the VHS tape. The only good thing about this DVD is that in the insert in the case, they give 10 \\"clues\\" on figuring out what the movie is all about. But those can easily be dug up on the internet.<br />In this film, a woman finds herself on Mulholland Drive outside Hollywood, suffering from amnesia. She befriends an aspiring actress and together they attempt to find out who she is. Meanwhile, a timid film director is slowly losing control of his life and the answer to all his problems lies on a journey to a mysterious man known only as \\"The Cowboy.\\"<br />The Cowboy is an intresting character, as is every other character in MD, in the way that Lynch only tells us so much about him, but leaves the rest to our imaginations. This keeps The Cowboy as mysterious as possible, which the film intends.<br />As in all David Lynch films, there are some very disturbing elements: there are numerous twisted lesbian sex scenes, there is a small restaurant in which a disgusting troll inhabits the garbage dumpster of, and there is a brutal car crash at the beginning of the film. This film is NOT for all tastes. While not quite as shocking as \\"Blue Velvet\\", David Lynch is still his normal, warped self.
0684800713|2.0|This book is a bit boring to me, although it shows many emotions of different characters.The main character Jake, is a very mysterious and self-conscience man. In the beginning of this novel the story taked place in Paris, France. As you read on you encounter many charatcers. In the begining of the chapter you are introduced to Robert Cohn. He plays a minor part of this story, but helps bring out Jake's personality in ths novel. Brett palkys a big part in Jake's life. Brett and Jake have feelings for one another, but cannot be together because of complications with Jkae's body. Thre are other characters, but these three are the most you will see and read about. <br />The time in which this novel taked palce and now times are similar in ways. In both the characters in the novel and people now-a-days, turn to alcohol for reliefand have tendencies to party all night long. Yet, there are parts in the book I cannot believe can occur, but this may be a good part of the novel. a place where dreams may happen.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|\\"session 9\\" surpasses stanley kubrick's \\"the shining\\" in terms of both atmosphere and pacing, and i don't make the comparison lightly.  i was astounded that a USA film which I expected to be nothing more than fun, typical modern horror garbage to laugh at with friends turned out to be one of the best horror movies i've seen in the last two decades. although it starts slowly and the opening scenes, which should have established the overwhelming power and mood to come are merely jumpy and mediocre, it quickly takes off and the increasing edginess of the characters as they come under the derelict asylum's depraved influence is acted perfectly by the genuinely sterling performances given be the five characters. the bizarre collages on the wall by former patients and the dialogue by one of the more intelligent workers about the reasons why the asylum was closed flawlessly establish the atmosphere, and the character gordon is brilliantly deranged into submission to the building right from the outset. the best touch in this movie is the really disturbing soundtrack of 'repressed memory' therapy recordings that are played while the characters slowly lose their minds and turn against one another.  the ending sequences are so deeply disturbing as to be indescribable. while the film obvious has logical flaws, this is more intended as a study of madness, desctruction and hopelessness perpetrated by unseen forces of evil, and to say the least, it works. a delightfully demented piece of incredible inspiration and imagination.
B00005RYL9|3.0|I figured for the price, that the CD with music from the movie would be the WHOLE soundtrack, but instead there are only THREE songs on it. If I had realized that's what I was getting, I would have been a less-expensive DVD. <br />The movie is as charming as ever, and there were some scenes I don't recall from the VHS that I am replacing with this ... but I think I paid too much.
B00005JKED|4.0|Its a good movie but the plot can get confusing sometimes. After you watch it a few times you kind of get tired of it. But it all depends on your taste in movies and how fast you get tired of watching movies over and over again.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Rarely does a rock album come with all the supporting materials that this one does.  There is a dense layer of sound and mischief.  The guys are playing around, seeing how far they can go with you still along.  To the old fans that like their bands to make the same album their entire career, you are going to find a mystery in this music.  There is no depression.  It's gone.  This is high art that rocks.  This is contemporary literature dressed up with pop with white noise flying out of control.
0790729644|5.0|Now I don't like western movies that much at all. But this is one of the best (of any kind) of movies I've EVER seen. It has some surprising plot and shows more of the dirtier side of the old west. Not just your average sheriff kills the evil bank robber in a shoot out/drawal. This is deffinitely a must OWN it is a \\"Hall of Famer\\" to me.
6305165912|5.0|This is a terrific, hilariously prurient film, with all sorts of great nuances and twists.<br />I gave it to a friend on his 49th birthday. At a family gathering to celebrate, he mentioned he'd received The Big Lebowski as a gift. His nephew, 22, started bubbling: \\"Oh man, oh man, The Big Lebowski is the greatest movie ever made! It's the greatest movie in history! Oh man, I watch it ever week, it's the best movie I've ever seen!!\\" and so on.<br />My friend's little 70-something mother said, \\"Oh, good -- let's watch it after we finish eating!\\"<br />And the moral of the story is: Regardless how great and fantistic you hear that a movie might be, do not EVER EVER EVER watch it with your mother unless you've seen it by yourself first.<br />P.S. The Dude abides!<br />P.P.S.  Did you happen to notice the date on the check the Dude wrote, in the grocery store at the beginning of the movie?  The year is 1991 -- the day Sept. 11.

B00005YXZH|2.0|I just finished by first (and probably last) listen to this CD. I am not a musician. I don't care about technique or &quot;sonic adventurism&quot; or experimentalism etc.  The &quot;sonic bleed of competing signals&quot;, the &quot;cathartic squall of distortion&quot; don't do anything for me, mainly because they sound like they've just be added in order to make the songs more interesting given the lead sings hushed bland delivery.  Although the songs without all the sonic garnish added a somewhat more listenable, they still put me to sleep. This album might &quot;demand, and reward, repeated listens&quot;, but if there's nothing in the first listen to make you want to hear it again, why should I force myself to endure it again.
0385484518|5.0|With 3 kids, I hardly have a chance to read books, but this was a non-stop page turner and I read it in one sitting.  I was extremely touched by Morrie's outlook on life and wish everyone had the same outlook as he did.  I wish I had known this wonderful man - he touched a lot of hearts, including my own.  This is one book that I will make my children read.  By some strange coincidence, after I was done reading it - I realized it was Tuesday.  Thank you Morrie for sharing this Tuesday with me.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie is an amazing recount of the battle of Mogadishu where US special forces were involved in a day long battle against what seems like the entire city of Mogadishu.  There are excellent potrayals of the desperation of the situation and the heroics involved when the special forces, particulalrly the Rangers try to live up to their motto of Leave No Man Behind.  <br />I know that many critics were uncomfortable with the racial overtones, basicaly every soldier is white and the Somalis are all black but this is based on pure fact.  Indeed every special forces soldier in the Mog was white, in fact at the time 97% of the special forces were white.  This is stated in the book several times, but for some reason, critics were still uncomforatble with it.  <br />Enough of that, SEE this movie it is AMAZING and does not flinch from the subject matter.  If Blood and gore are not your cup of tea or if you squirmed through the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan then this may not be the movie for you, otherwise if you like action, excitement, true life drama then this is it.<br />BTW the Music is also very mood setting, a great mix of techno and ethnic music.
0201633612|4.0|This book is clearly intended more for use as a reference than a programming \\"HOW TO\\" text.  The code samples are extremely trivial, incomplete, and written in a C++-like format.  The authors avoided trying to be too language specific.  This is by design.  After all, object oriented programming can arguably be done in any language. <BR><br />The point of this book is to describe common programming problems and object oriented designs that solve these problems.  The idea is to get you to think object oriented and take advantage of well understood problems and associated design solutions, rather than tell you how to program.  If you are looking to this book as a programming tutorial look elsewhere as this is definitely a book for people who understand OOD and how to implement OO designs.<BR><br />I use this book as a reference, a sort of encyclopedia of ideas, to assist with design.  I find that I rarely use a pattern as it is written in the book, but instead use a stripped down or altered version of the pattern.  In short this book is a great source of design inspiration, but should be treated as more theory than fact.<BR><br />My only complaint is the writing style is poorly structured and very boring making it a tough read.
B000060MY6|5.0|The sequence is this:<br />Dream, flashback, reality.<br />The clue is the red blanket at the beginning of the dream--and a dream it is, from the start of the movie, until the Cowboy says \\"time to wake up.\\" Then it's flashback, showing the true relationship between the two women (and showing you who the other characters really are). Finally, in the last few minutes, it's reality, where the protagonist realizes the full import of what she's done, and ends it. <br />I had to see it three times before I figured all this out. But, oh, Lord, wasn't it a great movie?  Funny, erotic, brilliantly conceived, acted and filmed.<br />What's amazing about Lynch is how much he knows about dreams, and how well he uses that knowledge.
B00005YXZH|1.0|If you dream of meeting some touches of \\"A.M.\\" , never ever <BR>listen to this trash. There is no feeling of roots rock or<BR>alt-country taste at all. I bet you it must be waste of money<BR>if you buy this album. That is far away from American pop and<BR>rock. The arrengement of synth and keyboard have quite bad<BR>influence on the songs. I was about to throw away when I started<BR>to listen. Moreover the melody has no impression. I could stand<BR>ex. record \\"Summerteeth\\" ; however , I get angry with this<BR>betray. That is the worst album in this year , I'm sure.
B00005QIPH|4.0|It's not the best cd I've ever heard, but it is fun. The best songs are track 1 Is This It, track 5 Someday, and track 7 Last Nite. I think this is their first cd too which is impressive. The Strokes have a good sound to them pretty unique look too. I'm looking forward to hearing more of their stuff in the future.
1563894696|5.0|This is straight up one of the best graphic novels or mysterys I have ever read. The Long Halloween is about Batmans promise to rid Gotham City of the evils thats took his parents and how far he will go on his word. It is also about the battle for the criminal elements in Gotham between the gangsters police and \\"freaks\\". And a mystery as to who is \\"Holiday\\" a killer who shoots up members of the mob on each Holiday. The Long Halloween would have made a great movie in the Batman series but unfoprtunatly people wouldnt understand what the hell is going on. Dont get me wrong this book is easy to follow and is a great mystery. If you are a fan of the Dark Night, comics, or anything in general I suggest picking it up...
B00000JSJC|5.0|I love movies I can identify with. Lenny is just one of the guys in this movie that helps me do that. An ex-cop thrown off the vice squad for falling in love with a prostitute he later burns for.  He spends his days dealing illegal clips to make ends meet.  He goes from club to club. His sleazy, slacker and loser image is what makes him so admirable in this movie. He is a man that his lost the one thing that makes him happy.<br />A great sci-fi type film that is perfect for the single, loser, stay at home friday night type of guy like myself.
B00005T30L|4.0|I really enjoyed &quot;Ghost World&quot; and having been an angst ridden  &quot;outsider&quot; in high school myself, I could relate to the alienation of the central character, Enid. The movie although peppered with prickly humor and oddball characters has a true-to-life feel that effectively resonates  that universal sense of alienation that we have all experienced at one time or another just by virtue of having once been a teenager. The movie starts off as a comedy but  as Enid's self destructive behavior progressively manifests itself,  it ultimately achieves a real poignancy. The ending is the sort of Anti-Hollywood ending guaranteed to leave it out the running for an academy award. And that's a shame too, as the acting, directing and script were all first rate. And to all those who dismissed this as a &quot;chick-flick&quot;, you missed out on a real comic gem and believe me, I'm no &quot;chick&quot;.<BR>Recommended
B000059XUO|5.0|A mysteriousness follows throughout this whole film because of the death of Brandon Lee on the set.  <br />This movie is in the top 5 list on my collection.  The justified revenge, the awesome soundtrack and the dark scenes will leave you begging for more. <br />This should have been the only Crow movie made. The 2nd and 3rd crow offered nothing more than insult to Brandon Lee's great sacrafice upon making this film.
B00001IVOR|5.0|When i listen to this album over and over again i come to realize that although it does not have 1 song better then the best song on enter the wu tang it has a total of #14 pretty darn good songs. Enter the wu tang used to be the best rap album of all time to me but as good as that album is i only like about #6 songs on it. This album has some of the grittiest beats and shows WU Tang at their mighty best. The best song on this album to me is not Triumph. The best song is cash still rules/scary hours. But this album is laced with unbelievable songs like, For heavens sake, itz yours, cash still rules, visions, as high as wu tang get, severe punishment, Unbelievable lyrics in a better tomorrow, triumph, MGM, hells wind staff, sick beat on impossible. I love this album i have 3 copies!!
B00003CX95|5.0|Where can I begin. This movie offers everything. Romance, action and great battle scenes.  The music and scenery are breathtaking. There is nothing more I can say, simply one of the best movies of all time.
B00004UEDR|2.0|I rented this movie because Sandra Bullock is my all-time fave actress and she is great in all that I have seen from her. But I have to admit, this movie was a bit of a disappointment. The storyline was pretty sloppy, and the ending wasn't really an ending. It was a bad place to leave off. It gave me an inside look of what goes on with people in rehab though, so in that way I did enjoy it. But if you're looking for solid storylines, this may not be the movie for you.
B00005221M|5.0|An epic tale of 3 surviving members of an almost extinct tribe.  Besides it's killer soundtrack, this movie just plain rocks!<BR>Breathtaking views...draw jopping battle scenes....a forbidden love...
0812550706|5.0|There is no other way to put it. I have read other science fiction books, those who appeal to adults OR children, but never one that quite did what Ender's Game did.<br />Throughout Ender's training in battle school, the teachers  barrage him with tests that can't be won, challanges that can't be overcome, and obsticals that were to great to break through, and yet Ender finds ways that the teachers, or you would have never thought of. This child hero is the hero that appeals to children, and some adults.<br />While on earth, the sibling of the boy wonder do their part to fire up the minds of the adults that hold politicial power overthe world. How these children deal with the problems facing Earth is definently how this book appeals to the adult readers. This book is great on its own, and better if you read the entire series. <br />You can't go wrong reading this book.
6305308659|4.0|Well, this movie in whole is not really together.  It went to different directions from the original point somewhere down the line.  Maybe because Mr. Gary Ross, the first time director, had too much to say in his directorial debut (he was a screenwriter.  But the strong production value, the great cast, and the attention to artwork and to details are so winning that I can't help but to like this movie.  Heck, anything Toby and/or Reese stars, I will watch.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I'll admit it, I got swept up in the whole Alicia keys hype, went out, purchased the CD and was totally disappointed.  Towards Grammy time however, I started hearing about India Arie and her album 'Acoustic Soul' - at first I thought it would be a repeat preformance of Keys's lack-luster album.  I watched an interview with India Arie that made me rethink that oppinion; she was beautiful, down to earth, yet eloquent - afterward I felt compelled to buy the album to see if she could live up to my expectations.  I have to say I was blown away by her work... I don't think I could adequately describe how truly AMAZING this album is.  I found it a refreshing change from the current trend in the music industry to support, produce and market [stuff]. If you do not buy this album you are REALLY missing out.
B0000636UN|4.0|I picked up this cd the day it came out and I love it. My favorite songs are Safe and Sound, It's So Easy, Soak Up The Sun, and Over You. I can relate to the lyrics on Over You because it is something everyone goes through with an ex. Plus Don Henley has been around for so long and I have so much respect for him especially the work he has done with the Eagles and his solo work. This album is a must hear.
6302797535|5.0|I have loved this movie for years and rent it 3-4 times a year and never get tired of it. I am so happy to see that so many other people feel the same way; I thought I was crazy to be so delighted with this obscure movie no one had ever heard of. I've mentioned Murder by Death for years to people when movies come up and everyone gives me a blank stare.<br />I think the whole movie is very well done: the acting is flawless, the writing, the setting (wonderful!), the mood (even more wonderful!).<br />If you're into creepy old mansions and rainy nights and hilarious one-liners, you'll have a ball. Enjoy!<br />p.s. I rented this movie once when I had just started dating a girl and she loved it, too. Needless to say I married her (and we still watch it!).
0684800713|3.0|The Sun Also Rises was a pretty good book, but I personally think that Brett and Jake should have ended up together because they both were in love with each other. Brett pretty much just played with Jakes emotions and when he thought that he was going to get his way with her she just left him for another guy or asked him for help with some guy. She may have loved Jake but she had a stronger love for money. I think that if her lust for money weren't so strong they would have ended up together.<BR>Earnest Hemmingway in all his books portrays him himself and his life excursions. Jake Barnes is the character that is depicted as Hemmingway himself. Jakes wound in World War 1 makes it impossible to ever have physical love with anyone, and especially Brett, the one he truly wanted to love. Brett's tendency to run around with different men all the time drives him even further into depression and drinking. The drinking also shows Hemingway himself, because he was a drunk.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I rented 'Donnie Darko' and watched it once, last night, alone, with the lights off.  In the movie's favor, I have to say that it did give me that creepy feeling I was looking for; it did keep me entertained; it did make me think twice.  If you're a fan of strange films with dark and uncertain content, then I certainly recommend you check out 'Donnie Darko' - it's worth seeing.<br />But part of the appeal of a strange and uncertain film is that it will come together in the end, explaining much of the strangeness in the film with a clever and satisfying twist.  Donnie Darko lacks any such satisfying conclusion, and that's why I can't say it's great.<br />The link between Donnie's visions and reality is the mystery of the film, and this mystery is really never solved, nor is it left for you to solve.  It's just... there.  Based on this,  I get the impression that the filmmakers themselves were uncertain about the plot.  There are a number of very interesting ideas in this movie, but while each stands fairly well on it's own, they fail to come together in a meaningful way.<br />The strengths of 'Donnie Darko' are its characters (the Darko family is great!) and its strange dark vision (you've got to see this bunny).  These alone make the movie well worth watching.<br />The lack of an equally strong conclusion is disappointing, but it doesn't mean you should miss seeing this movie.  Check it out.

B00005JKED|4.0|I had high hopes for this movie after my brother and my friends all told me it was \\"great\\".  And I gotta admit, for the beginning of the movie, I was really enjoying it.<br />Unforunately, I felt this movie went downhill the whole time.  Luckily, it starts out \\"great\\", so even though it declines, it still ends with at \\"good\\", making this a movie worth checking out.<br />The best scene in the movie, in my opinion, is when the our two main characters meet at a coffee shop two minutes into the movie.  Then, the next best scene is right after that -- them driving around in Denzel's car, and Denzel being a mysterious and charasmatic mofo, really screwing with the rookie's head.<br />With a few exceptions, I felt like the whole movie went like this.  It started off with incerdible promise, and then delivered a pretty good payoff.  I don't think the second half of this movie did the first half justice.<br />There's a certain mystery and confusion about Denzel's character in the first half, but I thought the movie let the cat out of the bag too early, and failed to secure a really high quality payoff for the mystery they spent the whole beginning establishing.  After they messed that up, they just tagged some random action onto the end of the movie because they had nowhere left to go.  They could have kept me guessing longer, and they could have made things a lot more psychologically interesting.<br />It's not that the end of the movie is BAD - it's just that the beginning is so damn good that it's a real shame the second half couldn't do it justice.  I can't help but think there was a better movie to be had here.<br />As it is, there were one or two scenes from the second half that were really good, but overall I think 'Training Day' droops as it goes, and really falls short of its true potential.<br />Check it out anyway though, becuase even if it falls short of it's potential, it's still a very entertaining and gritty movie, and for the first half at least, Denzel will hold you spellbound.
6305077630|5.0|The premise of this film is simple. Two unpopular high school geeks (Gary & Wyatt) decided to make their ultimate women using their computer. However the resulting woman (Kelly Le Brock) turns out to be more than a handful. <br />This film is definitely my favorite comedy of all time. It was Directed by John Hughes who also made such 80's classics as `The Breakfast Club' and `Ferris Bueller's Day Off '.<br />Anthony Michael Hall really makes this film in his role as Gary but there are notable early appearances by Robert Downey Jr and Bill Paxton who is brilliant as Gary's older brother Chet who constantly bullies him.<br />The film has too many brilliant scenes to go through but, the blues bar scene where the music stops and everybody stares at them when they walk in and the scene where the killer mutants from Mad Max turn up and trash the house party are just exceptional.<br />I cannot think of any film that has more one-liners in it and anyone who knows me know that I regularly quote lines from the film<br />\\"Gary do you feel like a chicken\\", \\"Well, if I could shoot an egg out of my ass right now I would\\"
B00005JKQZ|5.0|First off, I would like to say how suprised I am to see so many reviewers on Amazon bashing this movie.  I'm starting to wonder if some people even know what a good movie is.  Crowe's performance is nothing less than magical.  He really created something in this film and I was extremely disappointed to see him lose the Oscar.  The supporting cast included Jennifer Connelly who was very good as Alicia Nash, Ed Harris, Judd Hirsh, and many others.  Ron Howard's direction was impressive and this movie is truly a victory in his career.  Along with \\"In the Bedroom,\\" I'd say \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" was one of the two best films of 2001.
0345350499|5.0|I first wandered into the Mists of Avalon during my senior year at high school. I had never cared much for King Arthur or those ridiculous Mallory translations except to watch Monty Python illustrate their absurdity. This book took me by surprise. I could not do anything til I had finished reading it! (To the 13 yr-old reviewer, I say -- wait a few years.) I picked it up again twice during my 20s, because so many of the images remained in my mind, and coming back to the world of Morgaine was a welcome respite from demands of life &amp; work. Now in my 30s, and though I find the attitude of the women in here to be too negative for my taste anymore (I guess women have become so much more liberated that we don't feel like complaining as much?) I still believe it is one of the most mystically inspired books ever written. I put this book up there with Jonathan Livingston Seagull, The Bridges of Madison County, The Joy Luck Club and all other books that just seem to pour out of the Universe onto the pages. Others of Ms. Bradley's books are child's play in comparison, and do not even merit reviews. But this one -- obviously written at a time (it seems) of uninhibited creativity -- is a rare and wonderful work.  Read it if you're a woman, read it if you aren't. Read it if you love the Arthurian legends, read it anyway if you couldn't care less. Allow yourself to be led into the mists, and go on an unforgettable journey into this imagined past ... when you come back to the present, you'll have experienced a strange initiation and life will never be the same.
B0000636UN|5.0|I've always enjoyed Sheryl Crow's work,but never bought one of her records.This is my first,and I'm not disapointed.When I heard&quot;Soak up the Sun&quot; played on the radio,I couldn't stop singing this Fun,summerSong.I love the line,&quot;I'm gonna soak up the sun,while its still free,before it goes out on me.&quot;There gonna be playing this song every summer,and wait untill you see the video.When I read the songs listed on the CD,I couldn't wait to play &quot;Steve McQueen.&quot; I thought it was a Bio about this famous Actor,but its just a fantastic hook,&quot;Like Steve,McQueen,All I need's a fast Machine.&quot;My favorite cut is track number 8,&quot;Lucky Kid.&quot; This song could become a rock Classic.I can't stop playing it,and I love the pause,and the hook,&quot;Wasted.&quot;I could go on forever talking about this record,with Stevie Nicks,Don Henley,Keith Richards,and Gwyneth Paltrow Thanked in the linner notes,especially Stevie&quot;I love you Dearly.&quot; I think Nicks and Crow should do an entire CD together.The last number,&quot;Weather Channel,&quot; is the perfect ending.Soft,with just Sheryl singing along with her Acoustic Guitar,and Emmylou Harris on Guest Vocals.&quot;C'mom,c'mon&quot;is one of the first new CDs I've really enjoyed this year.
B00000064G|4.0|This album always cheers me up.  There is no way Nick Drake's music can evoke anything but supreme happiness and wonderment at the beauty and majesty that is our world.  Always sunny, never a drop of rain:  Nick Drake evokes what it means to be alive and sparkling.  A true cheerleader of cheer, a true champion of vigor and industry, Pink Moon is indeed a classic of optimism.

B0000009S3|5.0|'the present day composer refuses to die' was the quotation from Edgar Varese which graced each of the Mothers albums as I remember from the vinyl releases in England.<br />This particular album made such an impression on a group of young people in Sunderland that they renamed their \\"disco\\" in the Londonderry Hotel on Saturday evenings after it. Played some pretty neat music there too.<br />This album is in many ways the one which represents the huge body of work that Frank Zappa, composer and musician, created all within the original confines of 45 minutes available on a long playing record.<br />Working in the rock field can often be limiting for the serious musician due to the varying degrees of snobbery which exist between 'real' musicians and rock stars. Zappa was one of the very few who drew respect from all quarters for his work.<br />From the outset on this album one can find traces of all of his work, the catchy Peaches en Regalia leads the field, the warm up for the title track with the redoubtable Don Van Vliet exercising his vocal chords with some of the most immortal lyrics in rock history before letting Zappa present a showcase of his considerable guitar playing talents. As usual the maestro assembled a team of the highest musical talents to assist him on this journey and on Willie the Pimp, Don 'Sugarcane' Harris provides a taster of things to come later on the Gumbo Variations, very reminiscent of his work on 'Weasels Ripped My Flesh'. Acclaimed by many as THE outstanding track on the album, Willie the Pimp' is distinguished by those awesome vocals but musically the performance is equalled if not bettered by the subsequent tracks.<br />'Son of Mr. Green Genes' is also another showcase for the Zappa guitar talent but here the playing is more restrained and is contained within exquisite performances by Ian Underwood in particular. Where is he today, I wonder? The run towards the end of the composition is excellent and the interplay between Zappa and Underwood displays a great deal of understanding between the two musicians.<br />All of the tracks on this album have, as another reviewer has noted, memorable tunes. What is also noticeable are some of the themes which appear on other albums such as the Grand Wazoo and Waka Jawaka as well as the earlier Mothers albums and the later works such as the Yellow Shark. That Zappa was in tune with the classical world is undeniable but he was clearly interested in serious music of all forms as evidenced by the recurring themes which later became the trademark of Terry Riley as well as Philip Glass.<br />Hot Rats is a veritable goldmine of music which can be listened to again and again and again without being totally depleted. To me this album demonstrates the genius that was Frank Zappa and his untimely death has deprived humanity of a significant musical talent.derwood displays a great deal of understanding between the two musicians.<br />All of the tracks on this album have, as another reviewer has noted, memorable tunes.

B00005U2LM|5.0|First of all,<BR>I suggest if you have read other reviews that,you blank them out and listen to this one! Now the one point I want to get across before anything is that any one who knows anything about hip-hop,anything at all,it is that,Wu-tang is far underated dispite there already superstar status! True hip-hop fans know that,Wu delivers a combination of beats and lyrics that take you to school, son! Nobody touches them! NOBODY! Thats why if your just getting into the game,Or already have been in it,IRON FLAG,the album is for you! Wu tang reprsents what hip-hop is all about. Which is,anthems for the ghetto,and hope for the future. And Iron Flag delivers that again and again! With this album,Wu showed again why they don't need commercialism and a beat maker to have a great album. Wu can take a drum machine and a half broken microphone,and still deliver lyrics and beats that sting you in your stomach and make you think! With songs, &quot;radioactive&quot; ,&quot;In the hood&quot;,&quot;rules&quot;,&quot;y'all been warned&quot;and,&quot;UZI&quot;,Iron Flag proofs just that. No other MC's are at that level(with the exception of Busta rhymes,And Nas) of greatness. You think I dodn't know? I've seen other rappers and mc's tell it themselves,that Wu is like the tree of hip-hop and everybody else is just a branch off of them. You can trace lyrics from other MC's albums that lead to somthing that WU said a long time ago. <BR> So,Basically I'm just here to break the silence:Wu-tang and Iron Flag are the best things out there,and any true hip-hop fan knows it!
B000002X4T|4.0|Hell, after seeing the Jefferson Starship at BB Kings in New York I had to splurge on my old Airplane albums.<br />I recall an old friend Phil Outram (hi Phil) going on and on about this album as being the best Airplane album ever but I could never agree.<br />It is the beginning of the end for the band and the seeds for it's own destruction are very visible in hindsight but especially so on the following album Bark.<br />Here the clever juxtaposition of We Can be Together at the front and Volunteers at the back is rendered complete by the modern day CD player which allows them to be played next to each other to square the circle.<br />There are some good songs, some really good playing, great vocals and great singing...I love Marty Balin's voice it is so good to see that he has not lost the voice or the boyish good looks and that wonderful cute look but I digress.<br />My favourite track is Wooden Ships scoring the big points for lyrics, imagery, sound and voices but especially for that impassioned guitar cry which resonates throughout the album. Crosby Stills and Nash had the pretty version but even with Neil Young they cannot touch Jorma Kaukonen's lead.<br />This is the last Airplane album that I can honestly say that I really liked. It is not their best and the following three albums excluding Monterey nose dived.<br />\

B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan's \\"no helmets no pads...just balls\\" (besides having a pretty funny title) is punk rock at its best. If you are a fan of Blink182, or New Found Glory you will love Simple Plan. Their songs reflect the feelings of an average teenager (well they reflected mine)So buy Simple Plan's cd and support them, they definetly deserve it!!!!!

B00003CXTG|1.0|Let me start by asking you a question.  When DVD's came out, weren't you happy that a long movie like 'Titanic' would be able to fit on one DVD and not split into two discs like on video?  I'm sure you would answer yes, so that begs the question, what is the purpose of splitting 'Pearl Harbor' onto 2 DVD's?  It is stupid if you ask me.  That is the only reason why I gave this 1 star rather than 3.<br />The movie itself was ok.  The special effects were good, but you could tell that they were special effects, and that always detracts from my enjoyment of a film.  I thought the story was really two movies in one, a love story and a war story.  Each one would have been great on its own, but mixed together they just make for a long movie.  I also thought that Ben Affleck was not that good, and over acted for most if not all of the film.<br />I would not suggest buying this DVD because the film is split onto two disks, and the movie was not that great. Hope this helps you stay away from this purchase.

This book is obviously a children's book, and as a child having it read to me, I felt it was a powerful message about love.  Now as a teenager and perfectly capable of jumping to such SICK conclusions as incest, I never have and never wpould have until I read some of the reviews here online.  I believe this book to be quite touching, about the depth of a parent's love for a child who isn't perfect.  A child having this book read to them simply understands that if they make mistakes, their parents will still love them.  Only an adult with a sick or demented mind would jump to the idea that the relationship the mother has with her son is somehow \\"creepy\\".  Get a life, people, and pull your minds out of the gutter.  I love this book.
B00005R2M3|2.0|I have been a long time fan of Shakira. She was once sort of a role model, as I am from Colombia as well. Pies Descalzos and then Donde Estn Los Ladrones? were there for me always. Shakira's voice is strong and powerful, however that was not her biggest talent. She was able to take fairly simple songs with fairly simple themes and transform them into emotional and precious songs that touched my soul. Her lyrics, in Spanish, were some of the best, even if they were still purely pop. The combination of her strong lyrics, her amazing voice and her ability to weave gorgeous tapestries through her music was a true gift. Unfortunately, Shakira has decided that huge, immediate success is more important than intimately revealing her inner thoughts to the people, if only few, that she had been for many years. Laundry Service, and don't even let me get started on the title, is a poor effort with bland songs and forced and artificial lyrics. It's too bad that Shakira does not have a command of the English language, because she really can write beautiful lyrics in Spanish. The single, Whenever, Wherever, is catchy, but listening to it makes me feel like it could just be another Britney Spears song and not the girl who warmed my heart. Truly disappointing. I give it two stars because Shakira still has that devastatingly beautiful voice.
0618135871|4.0|Great Little Novel.  Roth's choice of First Person narration makes this work all the much better.  David Kapesh combines age and experience to give a balanced view of both himself and the world.  Don't let the title throw you.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Well I am only on my third listen of YHF and I don't really know exactly what to say about it.  I know it is a very good album and most of the songs have already grabbed me with great understated melodies and excellent lyrics...distortion and effects but they do not take away from the vocals and traditional instruments...different than Summerteeth, different than A.M., different than Being There and at this early stage in my listening, better than them all...If you want to buy a great album that you will still listen to ten years from now, buy this album...Good music for anyone with a decent ear, patience and a heart...
B000000IRD|5.0|This Def Leppard Album is a must own for anyone who loves rock music.  Incredible vocals, hard drum beats, lightining guitar.<br />I have owned this CD for 12 years and would never let it go!  Great album to play loud, to motivate oneself.<br />DEF LEPPARD RULES!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Warner Brothers should be kicking themselves over not releasing this. I can't imagine what they expected a new Wilco album to sound like. This is a natural progression from their previous works. While there are individual songs on their other albums that I like more than the ones on this, listened to as a whole this is a superior album. It's one of those rare albums that once you've listened to it a few times, you'll never be able to hear a song from it without expecting the next track on the album to follow it. It cries out to be listened to in full each time. If I could make one complaint, it's that perhaps it has a few psychedelic touches that don't always work.
B000065U1N|5.0|I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in seeing what Rangers and Delta Force are trained to do. This movie is the best depiction of the scenarios we have faced and triumphed. I hope that talented directors like Ridley Scott can direct future movies involving the fighting soldiers of our Special Operations community. This is truly a collectible. The book is even better.<br />RANGERS LEAD THE WAY!!!
0140067477|3.0|I like what I read or I hate it.  Simple as that.  Well, This book was annoying in several ways, yet my affection for Winnie The Pooh bouyed my rating of the book, and my interest in Eastern philosophy.  I was apalled by Hoff's constant bashing at \\"intellectuals\\" and veiled ranting.  I was also annoyed at Hoff's bashing of other faiths as essentially being \\"Wrong\\".  A true Taoist wouldn't beat someone over the head about how \\"wrong\\" their Way is because it happens to be structured and staid.  That may just be the natural-flowing Way for them.  It's a so-so introduction to Taoism, so I'd recommend [[ASIN:0394733118 Tao: The Watercourse Way]] by Alan Watts and a nice translation of the Tao Te Ching.  Put the two together and you'll grok it better than Hoff ever will.    Then Again, you can read Hoff's books with an open mind....and as a preacher I once knew said \\"Eat the meat, and leave the bones\\".
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I have seen a lot of DVDs but this is the best designed with the most extras (that are worth it) that I have seen, the second disk has lots of features that talk about the tech of the movie indepth.  The director's comentary is ongoing with few holes in the interesting comentary.  These are major addons to a great movie.  I recomend at least a rental to every DVD maker to see what a great DVD looks like, feels like, and runs like.
B000065U1N|5.0|I just got done reading the 1 star reviews of this film and they truly must be a bunch of liberal, tree hugging, anti- war freaks.  This movie is realistic in content and special effects, entertaining, heart pounding and also heart touching.  It definitely shows the military of the United States of America to be the kick ass super-power military that it is!  Sad; however, is that it also shows the unappreciative citizens in foreign countries and how they abhore and hate the USA (yes I'm referring to Somalia, Kuwait, Liberia, France, and the list goes on...).  Despite the many efforts we have made to help these people in the past and help even today via military assistance or aid they despise us.  Not long after Black Hawk Down came out in the US, a boot leg copy ended up in Mogadishu, Somalia, the actual site where the real event took place.  You know what the Somalia citizens there watching the movie cheered for?  It wasn't the bravery of the US soldiers trying to rescue downed helicopter pilots and sacrificing their lives.  It was the death of American service men and the shooting down of the 2 Black Hawk helicopters.   Just goes to show you that you can't help those who don't want your help.  Overall, this movie kicks...and if you want to see a true, yes I said true, representation of how the USA military kicks...go see this great flick.  I can't wait for it to come out on DVD!
B00005J6UP|5.0|Well, what can I say.  This movie cracks me up everytime I watch it and always keeps me interested.  Although I grew up after the movie was released, I think it is the greatest 80's movie in the world next to 'the breakfast club' and 'bill and ted's excellent adventure'.  I watch it every month on the 8th as a tradition.  I recomend it to everyone.  It is so cool!
B00003CXI0|4.0|I've read all four books of Harry Potter and can't wait for the next.  And of course I'd like to see the movie.  The movie is excellent, but I feel a little bit frustrated because so many things has been cut out from the original story.  The thrill of the books because of the way the writer expressing exaggeratingly on what happen to the character, that's what make it so fun to read.  And the character, besides Harry, Hermione and Ron is nice too, especially Fred & George and of course in the other books, Oliver Wood.  However, I still like the movie and keep recommending to each of my family member to watch it.  Mind you, I'm 31 years old actually, but I like to watch it so that I can share the fun with my kids and nieces and nephews.
B00005LC3Y|2.0|...and this is one of them.  People wouldn't defend this film so zealously if it had been made by someone other than Kubrick, but his cult of enigmatic personality drives many to believe that he could do no wrong.  You'll see a similar blind loyalty to Kubrick's &quot;Eyes Wide Shut.&quot;<br />This is NOT &quot;one of the best war movies of all time&quot;...that's silly.  It doesn't even approach &quot;Patton&quot; in terms of character, nor does it rival &quot;Tora Tora Tora&quot; in scope. &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; are both superior psychological dramas, and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; does a better job of portraying the simultaneous heroism/obscenity of battle.  What you do get with &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; that you don't get with those other films is Kubrick's trademark pessimism about human beings, which is neither insightful nor particularly interesting.  But then most people these days think that good art expresses only one thing--nihilism.  At his worst, Kubrick fed that mistaken belief.
B000060P79|4.0|THis CD is great, but thanks to those critics it will be \\"just another punk CD\\". Two Weak Points: Some songs just blend together. 'Perfect...(except the CHORUS) Good Points: Trax 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Great Points: \\"I'd Do Anything\\" has no music solos, a short, great pop-punk(I use the term loosely) song. \\"I'm Just A Kid\\" wasa an obvious single. And the best song on the CD is \\"I'll Meet You There\\".
0440219078|5.0|I think \\"THE GIVER\\" is a good book.  At first I didn't understand it , but then everything started to unfold.  The ending wasn't what I expected but then I figured out that I could make up my own Ending Its a must have book.
B00005JKED|2.0|nor is it even enlightened social commentary.<br />It's just another fantasy movie about a good guy (white rookie cop who lives in suburban LA - what was his last job?  corporate CFO?) and a bad cop (black guy with Latino wife living in middle of gang infested jungle - I haven't been there, so can't comment).  This movie is a downer from start to finish that left me wonder why I spent two hours with it.<br />Denzel best actor?  Not based on this film.  The political tide of Hollywood finally turned his way.  Sure, the character is scary and creepy, but he's ultimately just another Hollywood fantasy thug.<br />I gave it two stars, because it at least inspired me to comment on the sad state of moviemaking these days.
6305903182|4.0|Coming off the success of Scream 1 & 2, Scream 3 continues to guide us through the life of Sidney (neve campbell), Gale (Courtney Cox) and Dewey (David Arquette). This film deals more with the past and Sidney's role in this movie is diminished slightly from the previous films. Again, the Ghostface Killer stalks and kills and its up to the cast to find out who the killer (or killers) is/are before its too late. Although not as good as the first two, Scream 3 does entertain and holds up much better than other horror film sequels (Hellraiser 3, Halloween 3, etc.). A must-see for die-hard Scream fans, but regular horror film fans may want to pass on this particular Scream.
B0000636UN|1.0|I really hate to have to say this, because I have been a major fan of Sheryl for years, but I was extremely disappointed by this album. And it took so long to hit the shelves, which only adds to my frustration! It's like she's a huge star now, and surrounded by sycophants who tell her everything she does is gold, but that is NOT the case. These songs are mixed so badly, and the lyrics could have been written by a third grader, for the most part! And what's with all the melodramatic strings on every other track, overwhelming the natural build of emotion that would come if everything were stripped down and you actually had some room to have a reaction? Sheryl needs to chill out and get back to her roots. She's gone Hollywood, in the most bloated and complacent way. I'm sure Pepsi will be signing a contract with her this week for \\"You're an Original.\\" Sad. I won't buy another one of her records without listening to it first. Oh, and by the way, thanks for not mentioning your fans even once in the liner notes. What happened to her heart???
B000002LCB|5.0|The love songs on this album are beautiful, enough to make my heart melt.  They capture the true beauty of the love portrayed in the movie.  The fight songs are thrilling and the friends and dance songs are joyous, making all want to stand up and dance.
B00005YXZH|5.0|In talking to fellow Wilco fans, I've noticed something that I don't often see in fans of other bands - an excitement about change. And let's face it - Wilco's sound has definitely benefitted from a lack of permanent grounding, and YHF takes the biggest steps from the often-repeated stories of Uncle Tupelo this and alt-country that and all the other hogwash.<br />So we can talk about labels and history and the like, but I'll leave that to the music critics. The history only matters if you're already a Wilco fan, and if you're like most Wilco fans, the change from the past isn't even that big a deal. The question is, what merit does this record have on its own?<br />YHF is an album for our times - the human spirit confronted with the modern world is one way you can look at both the songwriting themes and the sounds employed in this album. Put headphones on to hear the organic, typical instruments doing battle with the swirling noise and layered arrangements; this added &quot;noise&quot; is not an afterthought, but a carefully mastered part of the album's whole sound. The feeling you get listening to the way sound is arranged should be a clear indication that there is something deeper going on here, whether or not you're a fan of the noisiness that Jim O'Rourke brings to the table (and even though I usually don't care for this style, I am instinctively drawn to, and pleased by, its execution in YHF).<br />On top of this is Jeff Tweedy's touching songwriting. This is an album to read along to (or sing if you're luckier than I am), so keep the liner notes handy. Tweedy sings songs about the same love, unpredictable and wonderful and painful, in a strange world that is either always changing or always the same. Honestly, I don't know and I'm not going to try any harder than that to say what Tweedy says so much better with lyrics like, &quot;tall buildings shake, / voices escape, singing sad sad songs / tuned to chords strung down your cheeks, / &amp; bitter melodies, turning your orbit around.&quot; As he sings this in Jesus, Etc, Tweedy continues to talk about the night sky, and at the same time violins sweep through the air in a jagged, computer-challenged way that feels like the night sky is falling apart.<br />That's just one of thousands of intangible beauties that this album has, combining music and sound and word and thought (pardon if I sound like a hippie) into a truly special album, one that is reborn upon each listen. I have had this album for months thanks to the Internet, but nothing could have prepared me for my first CD listen, w/ liner notes, on headphones. It was an experience I'll never forget. Buy this album.
B00005B1EX|5.0|With Live Insurrection, Rob Halford proves once and for all that he was, is, and always will be the heart and soul of Judas Priest. Aside from being the absolute best metal vocalist of all time, Halford returns to the stage with unmatched intensity and an extremely tight band that could shame the current Priest lineup on any given night. The song selection is a collage of all stages of Halford's career drawing heavily from his 2000 release Resurrection while incorporating many old Judas Priest songs and some tunes from his Fight days. These discs are a great retrospective of Halford's entire career from Sad Wings all the way to Resurrection. The nagging question is can Halford still hit the high notes? The answer is a resounding YES!! In fact Rob's voice has never sounded as vicious as it does here just listen to Riding on the Wind(disc 2) and Into the Pit(disc 1) and all of your fears will be put to rest. I was extremely disappointed to learn of Halford's departure from Priest but after Fight and now Halford, I can honestly say that I hope that they never reunite. Rob Halford has stepped up the intensity of his music into the speed metal category and the results are amazing. DO NOT PASS THIS ONE UP!!! Highly Recommended.
B00005B36H|4.0|While some people might argue that the songs \\"get long and predictable\\", I disagree.  This cd is among the best metal cd out there, and I am including the mainstream rock.  It's songs are like a drug that you must use over and over, and when you don't listen for a long time you don't realize how good it feels again.  The beautiful \\"Parabol\\" is the softest track on the album, and perhaps the most beautiful.  It's sequel, if you can call it that, \\"Parabola\\", is arguably the most radio friendly.  For me, the track that made me stay up late was the almost title track, \\"Lateralis\\".  This was my favorite track, although there are many good ones.  Even non-fans cannot deny that the band has a mastery over the music they so well make.  The best way I can describe this album is that it makes you feel like Maynard holds the secrets of time, and he's willing to share some of his knowledge with you, while still leaving you hungry for more.
B000000OEI|5.0|Hans Zimmer was just statring to become a household name to movie score fans when he made Crimson Tide.  He had just done The Lion King, and actually did a very good score on Day of Thunder, which should be relaeased but that is another story.<BR>  Crimson Tide is a CD that has a ton of high action music filled with percussion and horns.  This is all beautifully woven together into one of the better soundtracks made in the last 10 years.  While some sections may come of as slow, the main theme of this movie, which can be heard best in the last piece on this CD, is one of the most powerful and beautiful themes ever composed.  This just has the sound of music composed by some of the great composers of centuries past.  It starts out as a tragic theme with a lone trumpet playing, and in two minutes becomes a patriotic theme filled with horns, percussion, and a great base.  For me, film music brings back memories for me and whenever I hear it, it reminds me of the Chicago Bears remarkable 2001 season.  It is no coincidence that you can hear this theme used in video montages by networks like NBC, and Fox, and even the WWF.  <BR>  Overall, this soundtrack isn't the best ever, but the one theme alone propels it into that &quot;must have&quot; collection.  That theme makes this soundtrack one of the better ones created in the last 10 years.  Now if you are looking for more quality, a better overall product from top to bottom may be Zimmer's soundtrack to The Peacemaker.  But the final piece on this CD makes this one of my favorite soundtracks to listen to.
B00005OM4N|5.0|\\"Britney\\" is Ms. Spears best album to date!  The lead off track, \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" is her most unique, and interesting track yet!  With great vocals, (recorded completely by Ms. Spears herself)  and great production (The Neptunes) it comes off more mature than any other song she has ever done, much like the entire album.  The second track, \\"Overprotected\\" has a great message, but lacks originallity and vocal prowess, returning to Max Martin's signiture sound.  \\"Lonely\\" the third song (my favorite) is a great song written by Britney herself, with a great rock feeling, and an awesome beat.  \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" is a powerful ballad, that Britney can really deliver on.  \\"Boys\\" is a hot R&B track produced by The Neptunes, with a great Janet Jackson tribute (\\"Nasty\\").  \\"Anticipating\\", another song penned by Spears, has a surprising disco feel to it, and \\"I Love Rock n' Roll\\" is a great, if unimaginative, cover of the classic gem.  \\"Cinderella\\" (Another Britney written song) is also lacking in originality and returns to Max's formula, like \\"Bombastic Love\\".  \\"Let Me Be\\" (Written by Spears) is a great song, with a great rhythm and melody, like \\"That's Where You Take Me\\" (Also written by Spears) Finally, \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" is a great track, with great vocals, and a rock feel to it, to make an overall incredible album!  Britney grows not only vocally, and musically, but also expressively in her third album.
B000060P79|4.0|Simple Plan's debut album &quot;No Pads...&quot; is a great representation of what teenagers go through.  With great songs like &quot;I'm Just A Kid&quot; and &quot;The Worst Day Ever&quot; they clearly define teenage angst without being angry and they're so upbeat that you can't help but jump up and down to them. All in all it's a fun and upbeat album and it's a must to add to any punk/pop fan's CD collection. Good if you like Blink 182, Sum 41, Sugar Ray, Good Charlotte.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I tried to like this movie.  I really did.  But for the life of me, I can't see how it's received so much praise.  The story makes great efforts to throw in a twist at the end ... but the preparation leading up to it makes such little sense that you know it's coming so it's no surprise.  There is little or no music to add suspense/emotion/etc. to the plot, and there are about a billion common-sense questions that go unanswered.  This was one of the worst movies I've ever watched.
B00003CY6M|4.0|This movie is a fabulous date flick. The story is a twisting plot that begins in NYC's Bloomingdale's department store. Jonathan(Cusack- &quot;High Fidelity&quot;) and Sara(Beckinsale- &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;) haggle over a pair of gloves. They can't decide who got there first and who should walk away with the soon to be infamous gift. Sara and Jonathan find themselves in a romantic predicament. They are instantly attracted to each other and finish the rest of the day spending time together and exploring the possibilities of being soulmates. They roam NYC, feeling the vibe of love. Unfortunately two things keep them from each other. Jonathan and Sara both have significant others.  While this seems a bit of a problem, it is nothing compared to Sara's obsession with destiny.<br />She is convinced that if they are truly meant to be, they will find each other again. She writes her name and phone number in a book. He writes his name and number on a 5 dollar bill. The money gets spent and the book gets sold.  She believes if they are truly meant to be together...these clues will resurface, assuring them of their soulmate qualities.<br />Years fly by and Sara and Jonathan have never forgotten each other. While they each have new loves and new careers, they are bombarded with signs of their past interlude.  <br />I expected this movie to be pretty linear, but it wasn't. The 5 dollar bill and the book aren't so contrived. Many other twists of fate bring them close to each other. I was glad to find this aspect of the movie refreshing.  <br />I did however get a little annoyed with the all too many coincidences that seemed unnecessary to bring the two lovebirds closer to each other.  The movie could have left a few out. <br />I do recommend this movie. It has that sweet &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; feel to it.  I love romantic movies, and if you are a fan of fate, you will find this movie very enjoyable. The plot might be a little too familiar, but who can resist John Cusack in a romantic lead?  No, he doesn't stand in the rain playing &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; to Sara, but gosh can he still sweep a girl off her feet.
B00003CX6P|5.0|I have never seen Matt more scary than in this movie.  Jude Law was just fantastic.  If you like thrillers, then you definitely will want this one.  I never tire of watching it over.
B000002MUQ|4.0|This disc showcases the best work by Van Halen with Sammy Hagar-without a doubt.  OU812 was boring, Carnal was better, the live disc was so-so.  Right out of the box here everything sounds better (literally).  This is one of the best sound recordings of the band-full and wide in scope with each instrument clearly defined in the sound spectrum.<br />'The seventh seal' is a great rocker.  As a bass player I really enjoy listening to Michael Anthony's bass playing on this song in particular.  The single 'Don't tell me' was the first song I heard in years from this band that actually caught my attention.  Of course, there are a few cheesy ones: ballads and instrumentals that serve no purpose and disrupt the flow of the disc.  But overall, if I were going to listen to anything from 1985 to 1995, this would be it.  This is a pretty strong return to form for Van Halen.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I am a 41 year mother of a 9 year old son and we both loved this movie!!!  I can personally say that I can hardly wait for the DVD to come out.  We saw it at the movies \\"3\\" times!!!  Yes, it is that good!!!  I read the book along with my son and I can honestly say this, the movie was EXACTLY like the book.  The actors all did a fantastic job!  I wish that I could say who was the best but they really were all that good.  I was surprised that it didn't get any Oscar nominations.  It is definitely a warm hearted movie with supsense and drama mixed in.  Buy the movie, get some popcorn, your family and friends and enjoy a great family evening together.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|You have to go back over two decades now to 1981 when this guitar extravaganza was released.  It is sad to listen to VH now after hearing this disc.  'Unchained' remains one of the bands all-time best songs, a solid rocker that never lets up defined by a great guitar riff.  The subject matter here is generally more serious than on previous albums (excepting 'One foot out the door' of course), yet doesn't contain the pretentiousness of some of the albums that followed (OU812, F.U.*.K.).  Somehow this remains a fun AND serious album at the same time.  Eddie and Dave have never sounded better, and Michael and Alex have never been tighter.<br />One of the best albums in the history of rock music.
B00005S6K8|5.0|They say that this was one of Harrison Ford's worst movies.  Well I disagree.  This is one fantastic movie. All the actors were incredible, especially Ford.  It is probably more of a girlie girl movie but what the heck.  <br />If you are love story type person, then this is a must have for your love store collection at home.
B000002UV9|5.0|I became a Queensryche fan after hearing this album in 1990.  I saw the videos on MTV (yes, they did actually show rock videos at one time!).  This is an amazing album, the watershed moment for this Seattle band.  Coming off the surprising popularity of their 1988 masterpiece \\"Operation Mindcrime\\", \\"Empire\\" was for many, the point at which this band spread its wings.  Empire is solid-not one dull track.  The recording is first rate.  My understanding is that this is the first album that was ever recorded completely digital-recording, mixdown, and mastering.  To my ears it sounds a bit lacking in the mid-range, but this is a MINOR oversight.<br />In any case, this disc features a plethora of singles-all of which charted-including the mega-hits 'Silent Lucidity' and 'Empire'.  'Anybody Listening' is a high point on the album.  Listen closely as the song fades out:  you hear a drug deal gone bad ('Empire' itself is about the drug Empire of American cities), and a gunshot is the end of the album.  'Best I Can' is also a showcase for the amazing talents of 'ryches two guitarists, probably the best pairing of guitarists in rock (forget Metallica, although Mustaine and Friedman of Megadeth are definitely in the running.)<br />Geoff Tate sounds amazing as usual, singing with passion and intensity like no one else can.  A defining album in the history of rock.<br />Essential.
B00003CXFV|5.0|An absolutely brilliant movie.  Julia is definitely the hottest star in Hollywood and this movie really shows all her acting skills.
B00000JMOF|5.0|This is, without question, the definitive gothic horror classic that set the standard.  My grandmother once told me when she went to see this movie that upon first sight of Karloff, two women literally fled the theatre.  We've heard the stories of the studio sending plants to theatres to do this, but this was in rural Kentucky.  Frankenstein explores the deep recesses of our minds, like what it would be like to have control over life and death, in essence to have the control as God.  When you couple the questions and topics this film brought out with the stellar performances given by Karloff, Colin Clive, Dwight Frye and the rest of the cast, you end up with a film for the ages.  Frankenstein stands as one of the greatest horror movies of all time today, and it will still be standing tall a hundred years from now.
0881030376|4.0|George and Lennie are very good friends. They are always doing things together and travel together. Lennie is the one who always makes trouble and Veorge always helps him. But now, Lennie just causes a serious problem that Veorge even can't help. Lennie is a huge guy, has a ind of a young child, and George is small and quick. Two of them are totally the opposite, not only the way they look, and the way they act, but they have a same dream. I like this book and I will recommend you to read it, because it is great and it will always give you surprise. Also, you will learn their friendship.
0930289331|4.0|Another example of a great comic book that definately isn't for kids.<br />After the success of DARK KNIGHT we saw the sequel BATMAN YEAR ONE.  I remember this one flying off the shelves at the comic store when the issues came out.<br />We see a two new arrivals in Gotham.  One a police lieutenant with a bit of a past who finds corruption rampart in the force and a fellow officer who he falls for creating corruption in his marriage.<br />We also find a rich playboy who thinks he is ready to begin his revenge on the underworld for the lives of his parents, starting with the corrupt police force.<br />Several things in the Batman mythos are re-written.  Gordon is a thirty something cop, Selina Kyle is a hooker instead of a jewel thief, it is a darker and gritter story, more in the genre of the Japaneese style of comics for adults.  Considering the direction Miller took daredevil it is no big shock.<br />It was the second step on the road to comics no longer being something for kids.  It was a great story, and a fine plot.  The artwork was done well, the style fit the story well, but save it for when the kids hit 15.
0684800713|4.0|I had to read \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" for school. As a sixteen-year-old, I could very well say how much I thought the story [was bad] but in all honest, I really enjoyed this book. I was about the \\"Lost Generation\\" feeling out of place after World War I. Trying to go on with there lives in a war that changed their lives forever. They are looking for meaning for life and truth and freedom. <br />I think the thing that made me so intrigued in this book is that ii was a real story. About real people. And there real problems. Real people, trying to grab a hold onto thier lives. Trying to find where they belong. With there same old boring problems and their same old mixed up lives.<br />This book, in a way, speaks to me.
0688145078|4.0|I bought this book to help my almost-three-years-old son adjust to the idea of a new baby brother or sister. He loves it and asks to read it about four times a day. The text is easy to understand. It explains some of babies' limitations (\\"Too little to walk. Too little to talk.\\") and also talks about why babies cry, etc. The illustrations are really sweet and everyone is smiling, even the kitty cat.<br />The one thing I don't like about this book is that it assumes the mom will be bottlefeeding. There are bottles in several pictures (one shows the brother giving a bottle). Since we breastfeed, I would have preferred a book where the mother nurses the baby. However, this hurdle was easily overcome by some quick mommy text improvisation. (\\"Babies like to nurse,\\" instead of \\"Babies like to drink milk\\"). All in all, it's a great sibling book and one I don't hesitate to recommend.
B0000633T6|1.0|I rented the widescreen version and after many frustrating attempts to turn off the closed captioning, I bought the full screen version. However, that didn't solve my problem. So I wrote to Universal and explained the problem, after a week they ask for my DVD player make and model, Toshiba SD-3109. That was two weeks ago!

B0000648WZ|1.0|I'm sorry they ever committed this movie to videotape and DVD.  What a severe waste of time and talent on the part of so many people putting this gory, plotless piece of trash together.  It's like watching a traffic accident--you just can't take your eyes off the carnage.  I watched the entire movie, waiting for it to improve, hoping that it would somehow redeem itself, but it never did.  RoboCop at least tempered its excessive violence with the subplot of the protagonist's loss of humanity.  Any attempt at social commentary is totally obscured in this movie by the graphic violence and shoddy acting.<br />Normally, I give films I don't like a second chance, but there's nothing even remotely compelling me to watch this again on DVD, not even the inclusion of deleted scenes.  I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's saying something since I'm a sucker for sci-fi, and so many of these films degenerate into techno-splatter or are more concerned with visual effects than plot.  Like another reviewer, I, too, am sorry that I had to give it even one star.  If negative star ratings were possible, this would be a black hole.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|Terrific fast-paced car-chase movie with a good soundtrack and memorable characters.<br />Nicolas Cage plays a reformed car thief (Memphis Raines) who gets sucked back in to do one last job to save his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi).  Memphis, and his band of former \\"boosters\\" plus the next generation of boosters (Kip's friends) must steal 50 classic and exotic cars before a 72 hour deadline is up.  They decide to do it in one night, because by the time \\"the heat is on to you, your ship has already sailed.\\"<br />This movie is filled with great visuals of some pretty cool cars, and solid performances by Cage, Angelina Jolie, and Robert Duvall.  The final chase is something that hasn't been seen since Steve McQueen's \\"Bullitt,\\" and the scene in which Cage cases a Ferrari dealership is one that I continue to play over and over to hear one line:  \\"You would not be a self-indulgent wiener, sir.  You'd be a connoisseur.\\"<br />The DVD's extra features consisted of the usual stuff:  Theater trailers, teasers, interviews with cast and crew, music videos, etc.  What truly would have been cool would have been a section that gives 2 or 3 paragraphs on each of the 50 cars that were on the list to steal.  It would have been great to see a single photo, plus a little piece on the car's brand new cost, current value, racing history, etc.  Maybe there were licensing issues or something...
B00003CXSM|4.0|I love this movie! This is an unusual role for Jennifer Lopez, considering she usually does action movies. She is great in it! I love her in this type of role! Mathew M. is great too! They have great chemistry together.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is the best album I've heard all year; in many years. (I'm in my 40's.) The sound twists around, defying the pigeonhole, and it just gets better each time you listen.<BR>So, maybe the industry mopes will figure out that there's a huge adult audience out here starved for great stuff like this? (a show of hands for those who gave up on commercial radio long ago) We can only dream. Kudos to Wilco!
B000002A3T|4.0|Anyone who says this isn't &quot;true Floyd&quot; needs to give the pre-Animals albums another listen.  There was a time when Pink Floyd wrote and performed together as a band, and made incredible music doing so.  But eventually, Roger Waters' ego got out of control, and they made a few albums which were mainly Waters' solo projects with the rest of the band (and others) serving as guest musicians.  They weren't bad albums, but they weren't very good examples of what Pink Floyd were capable of.<br />Fortunately, The Division Bell re-captures some of the classic Floydian atmosphere that began to leak out around the time of Animals.  This is especially true due to the re-joining of keyboardist Rick Wright.  Rick's playing is vital to the mood of this album -- very desolate and lonely; in fact, much of the music on this album has the ambience of a desert island.  Rick even sings on one track, Wearing The Inside Out -- many have criticized the &quot;dullness&quot; of his voice, but it is actually that dry, monotonous sound that makes his voice so effective, and it works perfectly in the context of the song.  (Again, listen to Rick's vocals on some of the early Floyd discs and hear how his &quot;dull&quot; tone is used to good effect.)<br />The only really bad thing that can be said about this album is that it doesn't cover any new ground -- most of the ideas here had already been used on previous albums.  But they do it very well and with a genuine sense of passion that they've managed to maintain even as 50-year-old men.  And after a string of solo projects disguised as group efforts, it's good to see Floyd once again playing together as a band.  I only wish Roger Waters and his fans could see it that way too.
B000005ITX|4.0|Having read so much about how good Forever Changes is, I decided to check Love out and purchase this album.  It certainly shows the group had considerable instrumental talents, and they were not shy about bringing out strings, horns, and anything else to give Forever Changes the texture it has. Perhaps that was the problem with its commercial success.  Individual songs can be good, but I think of this more as a concept album, the concept being acoustic guitar with frequent elaborate instrumental arrangements, and the songs kind of sounding the same.  The music is pretty, but the lyrics are occasionally bizarre, like those sick lines about \\"snot\\" in \\"Live and Let Live\\" (the only time I've heard that word in song lyrics).  There are good songs like \\"Alone Again Or,\\" the opener, and \\"The Daily Planet,\\" but syrupy excesses occasionally arise too, on \\"Andmoreagain\\" and \\"The Good Humor Man...\\" for example.  Someone once described these songs as catchy, but that is not so.  Instead, this set of songs is stream of consciousness, not that this is always unfavorable, but it can be, and more readily so from a commercial perspective.  So Love never achieved commercial success, but that is not because Arthur Lee did not wear leather pants.  This is an interesting recording, but The Doors, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Cream, Jimi Hendrix, The Beach Boys (did I say The Beatles?), and the like wrote songs that were both catchier and better.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Okay, let's start with the basics.  This is a great movie, one of the best Arthurian works to hit the screen (the other truly great is \\"Fisher King\\", but I digress), and you get a nice, clean version of the film.  No more murky VHS transfers where you can't see half the film.  On top of this it IS \\"Monty Python & The Holy Grail\\".  If you have not seen this film yet, see it.  YESTERDAY!<br />The bonus features add amusing little bits to the film.  One of the important points noted in the mini-documentary on sites, was the the whole film was budgeted for 150,000 Pounds-Sterling; in the end they went horrendously over budget and spent 200,000 Pounds.  Imagine making ANY film for that little money nowadays.  Then imagine making it as brilliant as this.<br />MP&THG parodies & taunts the Arthurian legends, Bergman films, police round-ups, historians, anarchists, monarchists, shrubbery, herrings, medieval food & clothing, musicals, and a few other vaguely related sujbects.  It is a film that is watchable multiple times (...I should know...); indeed you may HAVE to see it a second time just to catch all the jokes.  Then you'll have to watch it again to catch more jokes that you didn't even realize /were/ jokes the first couple times through.  <br />The director(s) commentary (Terrys Jones & Gilliam) is good, but a little too much time is spent on \\"the history of Monty Python\\" for my tastes -- I would have liked a little more about the film and a little less about stuff that is available in a couple dozen books and tv interviews.  The other commentary track is also uneven, but with spots of true brilliance.  Imagine three Pythons deciding to pull the MST3K treatment on their own film and you get the idea.  The mini-features on scouting locations, on how to use a cocoanut, the sing-alongs, the Lego-vision (yes, as in Legos, those snap together bricks), and how-to-walk-like-a-monk-hitting-his-head-with-a-board are quite funny.<br />If you like this movie, get the DVD.  If youLOVE this movie, the the Special Editon DVD.  <br />If you don't like it, get a recording of \\"Nixon in China\\"...
0525946284|4.0|Very quick good read... I read it on an airplane ride cross country.  The story gives a unique perspective of women in war.  Not your ordinary story where the hero gets the girl - the hero is the girl, the world is not a perfect place, war [stinks], and not everyone survives.  It is a truly unique militaristic story of WWII told by a woman who was not on the sidelines.  Not a feministic or women's rights novel though - just a unique spin on things.
0553573403|3.0|Let me start of by saying the following:  I have read Tolkein, I have read War & Peace, I have read Goblet of Fire, I have read the entire Patrick O'Brien Aubrey/Mataurin series.  In other words, big books don't scare me, nor do long tales.<br />This said, I doubt I will follow up this series.  There is not inherently bad to AGOT.  The writing is decent, if not exciting (don't worry -- you will NEVER need a dictionary for this book).  The characters are fine as far as they go, but they tend to be archtypical rather than fully-drawn.  There are a LOT of characters, probably on par with a Charles Dickens novel, though none are as memorable with the possible exception of The Imp.  There is a grittiness to the book that is good in a world where we have had too many happy fantasy novels, but I'm not sure the author has done anything with this world /besides/ making it gritty.<br />The book (and probably the series) seems to be inspired by the Wars of the Roses.  Stark = York, Lannister = Lancaster, a shaky crown in jeopardy, arguements that go back over generations supposedly, but are primarily based on who-killed-whom-recently.  This is fine turf to start with.  G.G. Kay has done wonders with the history-disguised-as-fantasy style of writing; this book in no way compares, however, to Tigana or Lions of al-Rassan.  There is a lot of background history to AGOT, but it is handled in a clumsy manner -- a common ploy is to have two characters will suddenly start talking about past events even though the conversation has nothing to do with their previous conversation or actions.<br />AGOT is not bad.  It is far from brilliant.  It is an average book, just there is a lot to it.  This is a trend with a lot of fantasy (see Jordan & Rawn for other examples of more-must-be-better).  A long book can be a good book; so too can a short book.  There are a lot of /details/ in this book, but very little insight or weeding.  It is a long history...-soap-opera plot that says nothing higher than people can be very nasty to each other; in the end whoever wins the throne at the end of this series will be no better and no worse than those in the past, if the books background history is to be believed.  For all that it is a long book, it is an easy read and not unpleasant.  I can't say \\"stay away\\", but I can't get worked up over it either, thus the 3 stars.  Read it.  Or not.  Your call.her than people can be very nasty to each other; in the end whoever wins the throne at the end of this series will be no better and no worse than those in the past, if the books background history is to be believed.

It is essential to your happiness.
B0000633T6|5.0|When I first saw this film in theatres, I thoroughly enjoyed it however was a bit dissapointed.  I realized later that my discontent did not stem from the movie but the way it was marketed.  In trailers, they portrayed the movie as a straight up action film in the tradition of &quot;enemy of the state.&quot;  This being said, the movie did not live up to THAT expectation.<br />When I realized this and watched the movie for the second time on DVD, I saw this film for what it really was...A superb chess match between Redfords character and the CIA bureacracy.  Everything else is truly secondary.  Though exciting and dramatic, the storys (portrayed as flashbacks in the film) that  Redfords character shares with the CIA taskforce, is really a strategy he is using to &quot;win the game...a game which you dont want to lose&quot;<br />Again, these flashbacks are insightful and sometimes thrilling, but are not meant to be represented as elements for an action film.  It is a thinking mans movie for someone who likes there intelligence films to be intelligent.  Hence the title Spy Game. Remember, some games are not won by brute physical force but with brains and strategic thinking instead.

0345409671|3.0|I just re-read the Vampire Chronicles series, and it really struck me how much this differs from the others. The standard formula is for the novel to be told in the first person by one of the vampires, who tells their story. Normally most of the story is in one historical period, and the attraction is Rice's ability to give an idea of how people lived in Byzantine Antioch, or Renaissance Venice, or pre-revolutionary France. You don't get that in this book. <br />Or rather you do but you get the tale of Memnoch the Devil, and it's not set on earth, but in heaven. This makes it very different from the other stories, because there is no way that Memnoch is recognizable as a human being, and that is the other strength of Rice's books. She shows the vampires as real people, reacting to real situations.<br />The basic story starts off with Lestat stalking a victim, who is particularly evil, so Lestat draws out the experience by stalking him over a long period, like a cat watching a mouse. He also stalks the victim's daughter, who is an evangelist. After killing the victim, he has a conversation with the victim's ghost, who asks him to look after the daughter. Lestat agrees, and then meets Memnoch, who is the Devil, and wants Lestat to work for him. First the Devil has to persuade Lestat how it is that he and God are not enemies, and to do this, he tells his story.<br />Most of the book is Memnoch's story, and how and why he fell from heaven, and a lot of it is religious discussion. Essentially, it gives a complete theological underpinning for the Vampire chronicles - how the existence of God can be reconciled with the existence of vampires, and vice versa. Rice lays it out in full, and the problem is that there is nothing sensual about theology, and sensuality is one of the main attractions of Rice's books. <br />Storywise, this book does advance the Lestat story, but I do not think that it is essential to read it, to get a full understanding of the Vampire Chronicles. However, it is important in terms of understanding the world that Rice is trying to create, and in terms of understanding Lestat's character development. But if it's sensuality that you're after, you won't find it here.
B00004X0ER|4.0|The afforementioned adjectives (\\"solid\\", and \\"professional\\"), are not normally the sort of adjectives one would use to describe punk-rock. Nevertheless, these guys ARE Swedes, which means they are, in fact, \\"solid\\" and \\"professional\\". The hype is, as with the Strokes, horrendous, and tends to somewhat short-change whatever musical value the album might have... A lot about The Hives seems, as a matter of fact, to be of the \\"Prefab\\" variety, as they each come equipped with catchy, faux-cool nicknames (\\"Screamin' Pelle\\", \\"Dangerous\\"???), and matching black-and-white New Wave suits. The lyrics are a bit on the Shakira E.S.L. side, and the music is, basically, Ron Asheton/Kimberley Rew on top of a Ramones backbeat, but the sheer COMMITMENT of these guys to the Punk and Post-Punk heritage makes the record phenomenally entertaining, if not original. Tracks 2, 4, and 6 are the standouts (\\"Die All Right!\\", \\"Main Offender\\", and \\"Hate to Say I Told You So\\"), but the record as a whole will not screw up your party or highway-driving experience. The White Stripes and Detroit Cobras do this much better, and the International Noise Conspiracy are a better Swedish post-punk band, but The Hives are worthy of some of the obscene amount of butt-kissing they've been getting.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I knew I was in trouble the instant I saw the futuristic cars with the neon lights running up the sides. And then the floating moon thing hunting robots. Huh? Was there some deep dark symbolism there that I need to consult the ghost of Freud about? Ok, Pinochio story, retold with a robot as the child. Sounds plausible. But how to get around the Blue Fairy thing (this is, after all, science)? I can imagine Spielberg at the story conference . . . &quot;I know! Let's get ALIENS in there, bring back the mother, who will, of course, remember just about everything even though she's been dead for 2000 years because of some convenient flaw in the space time continuum . . . blah, blah, blah.&quot; The sad thing is that I was looking forwared to this movie, having seen theatrical trailers. I should have stopped there. Everything good about this movie was contained in the preview. The rest is just . . . I'm so uninterested in this film that I'm not even going to complete this sente
B00001OH7N|3.0|For  1970's The Man Who Sold The World, David Bowie adopted a harder rock edge to his music.  Guitarist Mick Ronson laid down the biting guitar riffs and Mr. Bowie supplies some his most assertive vocals.  The title track is a classic, with its searing guitar and downcast beat.  Other strong songs include &quot;The Width Of A Circle&quot;, &quot;Running Gun Blues&quot; and &quot;The Superman&quot;.  The album as a whole is decent, but Mr. Bowie would really hit his stride on his next release.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Jeff Tweedy has transcended all boundaries of time and space and reveals the kind of maturity in his songwriting that will endear this album to future generations.  Substantively, the lyrics alone are poetry for our times:  Jesus etc., Ashes of American Flags and War on War--even though all written before 9/11, memorialize the mood of the nation after that tragic day forever: Voices whine/Skyscrapers are scraping together your voice it's smoking/Last cigarettes are all you can get/Turning your orbit around.<br />But beyond the lyrics are songs so remarkable and texturally rich, you can't stop listening and like a painting, each song takes on an alternative meaning and a different mood upon repeated listenings. And unlike Summerteeth and Being There, both stellar in their own right, there's no filler or missteps.  From the simplicity of Radio Cure to the cacaphonious<BR>I'm The Man Who Loves You, I've never heard anything quite like YHF, and I doubt I will ever again.
B000002U82|5.0|This is my absolute favorite album.  The weekend I got it I listened to it about 8 times and had only begun to realize its beauty.  It is a true masterpiece.  I HIGHLY recommend this album.  It holds the record for the album in the top 200 in the USA for the longest time.  It was there for over 15 years!  Enjoy this one for many years to come.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Despite what others said, I think this is one of the greatest films I have seen in years!  Definitely deserve an Oscar.
B00005AAFS|3.0|My main complaint with this cd is that it is pretty simple music for my progressive metal tastes. Generally the songs stay on one time signature and have only 2 or 3 riffs throughout the entire song.<br />...and yet, I find myself putting this in over Opeth or Nightwish or Dream Theater or Nevermore sometimes. Why? I think, despite their flaws and nu-metal associations (I do not think they are nu-metal, but being popular and metal apparently automagically makes you nu-metal to some people), Rammstein have a unique sound to their music that makes it worthwhile to listen to occasionally. Recommended if you want something different in your metal diet.
B00005RIKD|5.0|Although I've always enjoyed Sting's music, All This Time is the first Sting CD that I have bought. It was not a disappointment. Hearing some of Sting's classics with slighty different arangements and played live only makes Sting's music better. Fragile is my personal favorite on the disc and knowing that the Sep. 11th tragedy had happened the day of the recording makes the songs meaning and the inflicitions in his voice so much more meaningful. I definitely recommend this CD to everyone, whether you are a major Sting fan or not!
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Iron Maiden was, of course, one of the most important and influential metal bands of the 80s. Most such bands (Metallica, Ozzy, Megadeth) have either sold out or simply release uninspired albums over and over again. Iron Maiden has done something different here.<br />I'll admit that this was my first Iron Maiden CD (and I have since purchased two more.)and having seen most 80s bands essentially [bad] with their new releases when compared to bands from the 90s, I was worried that it wouldn't be so great. I was wrong!<br />This is excellent melodic metal music that is good even by modern heavy metal standards. Behold, IRON MAIDEN!! :)

B00005JKL8|4.0|I just picked up this film on DVD having never seen it before.  I wanted to initiallly but missed it in the theaters.  But anyway, I was pleasantly surprised.  This military action drama had elements of the movies Top Gun, Sniper, and Rambo.  As most should know, that the jist of this movie is that Owen Wilson plays a navigator on a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet and he and his pilot are shot down on a Christmas photo-recon mission over Bosnia.  The missile evading scene is pretty intense.  You haven't seen jet manuevers like that since Top Gun.<br />Now then the USS Carl Vinson gets the word that one of their planes have been shot down.  The problem is that the war is supposed to be over due to a peace treaty.  To send in a rescue mission and risk confrontation with the Serbs after the treaty would nullify the treaty and extend the war causing even more suffering.  So Gene Hackman's character is prohibited from launching a rescue mission.<br />For those that have seen Hackman's 1988 film Bat*21, might recognize some similarities in how the Carrier tells Owen to move from place to place for pick-up that never comes.  (In Bat*21, Hackamn played a Colonel that was shot down in 'Nam in which he used an overlay of a golf course on the map in plotting his movements).<br />One of the Serbs pursuing Wilson is a guy with an axe to grind.  He carries a high-powered sniper rifle, and we get scenes similar to Tom Berenger's 1993 film Sniper.  Wilson runs from him and gets shot at quite often.<br />The film concludes on a high frozen mountain where one of the ejection seats landed.  Wilson uses this seat as bait to get the sniper guy out in the open.  Wilson suddenly jumps up out of a snow bank and they fight to the death with shades of a Rambo scene.  However, the whole Serb army comes rolling in with armor suport and a platoon or two of infantry.  However by his time, Hackman has 3 loaded gunship helicopters on the way and they provide close air support against the Serbs.  Very fun scene with cool visuals and sounds.<br />This movie uses some very unique camera tricks.  There's several flashback scenes and they use reused footage, but from differnet angles and speeds.  It is very cool.<br />The picture and sound on the DVD is extraordinary.  The picture is very clean and sharp with great blacks and shadow definiton.  The sound, while not as good as Super-Bit titles, is very well mixed.  In action scenes, the bullets whiz by your head and explosions shake it.<br />This movie is a good showcase for Russian military equipment.  At first the F-18 is shot down by an Sa-13 Gopher SAM system.  The Serbs also have a couple of actual T-72s and several BMP-1s.  This movie was made with full cooperation with the US Navy including military supervisors.  So this movie is pretty much technically accurate.<br />Yes, the plot is a bit thin, but how many different ways can you tell a pilot rescue and evade mission?fun scene with cool visuals and sounds.<br />This movie uses some very unique camera tricks.

B00005RFVL|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Robbie to death.  He is sexy and intelligent.  I have all of his CD's and love them all, but this definately is not his best work.  I don't get why people rave over this CD.  There are a few funny moments, and Have You Met Ms. Jones? is an excellent song, but the rest of this CD is awful.  Try a Frank Sinatra CD if you want quailtiy.  But if you are intent on getting a Robbie CD I recommend either the Ego has Landed or Sing When Your Winning.  I've Been Expecting You is also an excellent CD, but The Ego Has Landed is about the same thing with a couple of different tracks.  <br />The Bottom Line is, Robbie Williams has definately done better, buy something else.
B00005B36H|4.0|Yes, that's exactly what it is. And I'm as surprised as you are. How on Earth is this band popular?! Not to say I don't wish them success. It's just very peculiar that, in a world dominated by Limp Bizkit and Slipknot, a band like Tool pushes their way into the mainstream.<br />This is a good album. I say good because that is the perfect word. It's not GREAT, nor is it bad or average. If you're in the mood for a progressive metal album that sounds a bit different than the usual Dream Theater kind of stuff, consider picking this up.
B000051VWW|5.0|This is a great album of mellow chill-out music. It's uncluttered and spacious, and the voice is so fine. I like her band by itself too (Sweetback). Wonder how long she'll take to follow this one up? I'd never heard of Sade before Lovers Rock (ah, youth), but now I have their entire catalog (plus Sweetback) which I'm slowly discovering. My best musical investment in awhile.
B000063CMK|5.0|While not as heavy and technical as bands like Dream Theater, Pain of Salvation make up for it with amazing composition and sheer emotion factor. These songs will move you to the point of tears, and sometimes that's exactly what you want in an album. Highly recommended.
B00001QEE9|5.0|Walt Disney said that he considered &quot;Snow White&quot; to be his masterpiece.  I hate to disagree with the master, but I think &quot;Pinocchio&quot; should have that honor.<br />Carlos Collodi's story of the puppet that becomes a boy has =never= been translated to film better.  Everyone knows the story - a lonely puppeteer named Gepetto make a wish to have a son.  The Blue Fairy hears his wish, and decides to grant it in an unusual fashion - she brings his most recent creation to life, and gives the -puppet- a chance to prove himself in order to become a boy.  Pinocchio has many misadventures while learning life's lessons, but finally appears to give his &quot;life&quot; when saving his father from the monster whale, Monstro.  The Blue Fairy returns and says that the ultimate sacrifice has earned him the ultimate prize - he becomes a live boy!<br />Honored by the Academy Awards for Best Song (&quot;Wish Upon A Star&quot;) and Best Score, this movie deserves every award in the book.  There has never been more object lessons taught so easily.  Don't lie.  Be brave.  Stay on the path to your goal.  And not preachy, either.<br />And the THX restoration of the video and sound makes this a real viewing experience - just as clear and clean as it might have been in the theaters in 1940.<br />The only disappointment I had is with the &quot;extra&quot; material on the DVD.  Almost no extra material at all.  It just includes the original theatrical trailer, and a French language track.  Come on, Disney, give us more about Pinocchio!  After seeing what was possible with the recent release of the &quot;platinum&quot; edition of &quot;Snow White&quot;, I can only hope that they will eventually turn their energies towards this film as well.<br />Highly recommended for families, espicially families with young children.  The &quot;Gold Edition&quot; of the DVD is now officially on moratorium - maybe after that we'll see the version we want!
B000002H6C|4.0|I personally consider this Metallica's best cd. Metallica once again takes the progressive element to their music a step further, crafting oddly timed riffs that still manage to flow perfectly. A worthy thrash album, even by modern standards....

B000062Y98|3.0|To those unfamiliar, Blind Guardian's style is essentially a blend of speed metal, European fantasy-based power metal, and their own unique medieval sound. Their latest offering is well written, well produced, and well executed, but unfortunately, it never gives the listener a break. Bands like Opeth are able to fuse their exhausting music with softer acoustic breaks and instrumentals to make the heavy parts hit that much harder, but Blind Guardian's music ends up a blurr of ignored emotion. I'd only recommend this to hardcore Blind Guardian fans or people interested in the genre of fantasy metal.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco had made the tansition from alt country to  fun dark pop to their folky-pop-electronica tinged sound with ease. Or at least, they make it sound easy on their newst release, the much anticipated Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.<br />I can hear the beach boys influence. Call me crazy, but i also sense some Dylan. But one of the defining characteristics of this album in the contributions of Jim O'Rourke. Hailed as a genius in the indie community, you'll be hard pressed to disagree once you here how YHF came out. You'll think your about to hear an urban jam, as a funky basd comes in, only it transforms into the poppy \\"Heavy Metal Drummer\\"(\\"Playin' Kiss Covers, beautiful and Stoned\\"). Or a jazzy intro will give way to a soft ballad. Songs like \\"Kamera\\" will stay in your head for stay, just like THF will stay in your cd player, on repeat, for days.<br />Modern classic, Jeff Tweedy is the most promising singer/songwriter i'm aware of at the moment.<br />Buy it.
0446677450|2.0|... This book should really be solely evaluated as a MOTIVATIONAL book... really to get you to think about building wealth and taking calculated risks.  I am an entrepreneur and the child of two self-employed parents.  The only way I was able to tolerate the inaccuracies and exaggerations found in Kiyosaki's specifics is because I have the experience, instincts, and education to divine the useful from the useless.  I fear that too many readers take his tales for canon.  For the most part, Kiyosaki gives a few bits of advice that are useful (e.g. \\"Make money work for you\\") and then garnishes his points with exaggerated examples that make things look easier than they really are.<br />Either way, here's the bottom line: Kiyosaki is a \\"get rich quick guy\\" but fortunately, instead of having to make 4 easy payments of [$$$] you can gain all of his wisdom for 12 bucks.  I would NOT reccommend his other books as they are simply efforts to build upon the success of the original.  He has even resorted to late night infomercials!  To be honest, I feel like this guy got rich off his book, in real estate as he claims.  The only reason I don't give him 1 star is that the book does have motivational value.  As I said in the beginning... this is NOT a personal finance book!
0064400018|5.0|Don't look here for big huge plots -- this book is a slice-of-life book about daily life in a pioneer family. There's no plot to speak of, so I'm not sure a small child's attention would be captured by this sort of writing. However, for me, an adult who grew up with these books, it's almost like a return to a simpler, easier time, when your worst fear was wolves.<br />I probably plow through the entire series, from \\"Big Woods\\" to the \\"On the Road Home\\", once a year. As a bonus, I've taken up a number of handcrafts, and the information in \\"Big Woods\\", among other books, has helped me enormously in my endeavors to live more simply.<br />I really think all kids should be exposed to this book. The family values in it are commendable, and the writing is easy to understand at a kid level. But be prepared to work with the child on this book.. they're barraged with explosions and shapechanging robots, so they may need a little help to appreciate a calmer, quieter work like this.
6304383827|5.0|This is a fabulous movie.  The situations and plots as the same as in the book and they are all very ironic humourus.  The characters are all done very well.  They even added stuff that wasn't even in the novel.  The book is pretty much equal to the movie, but I must confess in some ways it's even better.
B00004T37H|5.0|This movie had made me a very different person since I brought this video. It was love, differents, hope, and a violent but challaanging story. A very beautiful fore told story ^_^

B000002A3T|3.0|This album sounds somewhat like vintage mid-'70s (pre-Animals) Floyd. This time Wright and Mason were there as musical particpants from the start, and Wright composed music for a Floyd album for the first time in nearly 20 years, and Wright's influence in particular helps make this a far more pleasurable listening experience than the previous Floyd album, &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;. That said, most of the songs here are rather pedestrian, redeemed mainly by the Floydian arrangements, and the bite of Roger Waters' lyrics and album concepts is certainly missed. When this came out, a reviewer called it &quot;Lite Side of the Moon&quot;, and while this album is pleasant to listen to I think that is not an inaccurate description. Still, I bought it and like it well enough.
B00005NWM3|1.0|...  Nickelback's debut \\"The State\\" was half decent, the only reason I bought into that was because sometimes they reminded me of Alice in Chains but more poppy.  The day I heard \\"How You Remind Me\\" I almost crashed my car laughing, now Nickelback sounds like Creed trying to imitate Soundgarden.  I finally managed to listen to this album, and nearly every song is a rip off of some sort or another of Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam, except Nickelback has lost the edge they had on \\"The State\\" and replaced it with more catchy hooks and pop melodies than one can swallow.  With the recent wave of all the new \\"delicate, sensitive\\" hard rock like Nickelback, Creed, Staind, and Puddle of Mudd, hard rock/heavy metal as we know it is quickly going down ....  I for one have had enough of this ..., ...
B000002U9Y|3.0|First the sad ending. Syd Barrett was going to pieces, and was replaced by David Gilmour in Pink Floyd while this album was being made. His &quot;Jugband Blues&quot; ends the album, and it is as mad is its creator was- at turns disconnected (&quot;And I'm grateful to you for making it clear that I'm not here&quot;...&quot;and I'm wondering who could be writing this song&quot;) exuberant (the brass middle bit), then fractured and confusing, and finally sad as Syd, accompanied by his own accoustic guitar, sings &quot;And what exactly is a dream? And what exactly is a joke?&quot; <br />Syd is also featured on slide guitar in Rick Wright's &quot;Remember a Day&quot;, which was recorded during the &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; sessions, and he contributed some guitar work on a couple of other tracks, but most of the rest of &quot;Saucerful&quot; shows the new post-Syd Floyd trying to get by without him. Rather a tall order, one might think, since up to the time of his departure from the Floyd Syd had written most of their material. However, Rick Wright contributes a couple of songs here- the aforementioned &quot;Remember A Day&quot; and &quot;See Saw&quot;- which are nice, hazy songs (although their composer later said he thought them an embarrassment, and their lyrics do leave a lot to be desired). Roger Waters contributes three, including the standout &quot;Let there Be More Light&quot; with a blistering Dave Gilmour guitar solo at the end, &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; (which is OK but nothing special) and &quot;Corporal Clegg&quot;, which is a pretty good novelty number featuring kazoos in the chorus!<br />The long instrumental suite that starts side 2, &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;, is mostly dull or annoying noise to me (and is the main reason why this album gets only three stars), although the fine organ-led &quot;requiem&quot; at the end does partially redeem it. The live version on &quot;Ummagumma&quot; is far superior though!<br />Finally, I do really love the cover art- the first album cover by Hipgnosis I believe!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|While watching this movie, you begin to ask your self &quot;when the hell will this movie pick-up&quot; This film hides its great sophistication. Its not till the movie ends that you realize just how wonderful this movie is. <BR>The story is about a delusional teen Donnie Darko(Jake Gyllenhaal) who sees a six foot tall bunny rabbit named Frank. Donnie is saved for some reason by Frank and is forced to do his bidding. Donnie goes through the film affecting charectars one way or another which all ties together in the end. The ending is one of the best film endings ever and is well worth whatching over and over. <BR>Jake Gyllenhaal gives a spectacular preformance he keeps his charectar restrained and makes you believe this guy is insane. The rest of the cast does an excellent Job. <BR>I expect great things in the future for writer/director Richard Kelly
B000002C1W|2.0|Some people claim that there was no Pink Floyd after Roger Waters left. For others, there was no Pink Floyd after Syd Barrett went mad and &quot;left&quot; Floyd back in 1968. But in both cases, the others left behind went on using the Pink Floyd moniker and did quite well for themselves. When Waters blasted the Floyd following his departure as a &quot;spent force creatively&quot;, the Gilmour camp riposted by stating that they would prefer to be judged by the next Pink Floyd album, which turned out to be &quot;Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;. <br />So let's judge, shall we?! First of all, this album, which was largely concocted by Gilmour and a team of session players (Wright and Mason hardly even play on it)could be considered a Gilmour solo album. Even the previous (and far superior) &quot;Pink Floyd&quot; album &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, often considered a Roger Waters solo album, had more imput from other Floyds than this one does. But in fact Dave Gilmour's previous solo outing &quot;About Face&quot; is much better than this album. There is too much late '80s &quot;atmospheric&quot; synth gimmickry here, and not enough interesting tunes. Gilmour often makes it seem like his battles with Waters came from the clash of his musicality with Waters' interest in album concepts and lyrics, but there's little evidence of that musicality here - Gilmour did come up with great tunes on occaison (e.g. &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;), but there's nowhere near enough to carry a whole album here. &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; and &quot;One Slip&quot; are decent songs, while &quot;On the Turning Away&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Terminal Frost&quot; are quite good indeed. The rest is rather dull, in my opinion. At least Gilmour and co. were to do much better with the &quot;Division Bell&quot;
0060194995|5.0|I wanted to read thsi book because it is said to be in top 100 best books. And it is really worth it.<BR>I am not familar with racicism but I liked the book.<BR>It is very well written in a kid's point of view.
B000002UA0|5.0|WARNING: This is definately NOT the mid-to-late seventies model Pink Floyd that so many of us have come to know (and in some cases, love), although there are some similarities in terms of the instrumental styles- the droning organ, the bass, elements of the guitar style and so on. <br />The main differance here is Syd Barrett. He wrote or co-wrote all but one of the tracks on this album, and is lead vocalist and lead guitarist. He even dominates Roger Waters' \\"Take Up Thy Stethescope and Walk\\" with his wild guitar playing. <br />When I first heard this album, I had already bought \\"Relics\\", which was my introduction to the pre-Dark Side Floyd. I had loved the Syd-penned singles \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\", as well as \\"Bike\\", which ends this album, and I had even gotten used to \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\", a long unstructured psychedelic jam. Still, I wasn't fully prepared for this album. Much of it seemed strange and discordant at first listen. But it soon grew on me and today it is still one of my favourite albums. The songs and the psychedelic effects are just magical to me. \\"Bike\\" in particular is a wonderful nursery-rhyme song with great sound effects. How tragic though that the drug use that inspired much of this musical magic wreaked such havoc with Syd Barret's psyche. Months after this album was released Barret was kicked out of the band because his psychological condition had made him impossible to work with. Those who like this album may also want to check out Barrett's solo albums, for although those albums are quite different from this one (being far rougher and more basic in their arrangements and execution), they too show his songwriting genius.
B000001ESF|5.0|First off, this is one of the greatest HARD ROCK albums ever made.  Contridictory to Mr. Ruby's progressive-rock intent.  Rush has proved their selves over the years as one of the greatest bands ever.  Geddy Lee's heartpounding bass, Alex's Excellent riffs, and the ever impressing Neil Peart who in my opinion is the best drummer i have ever seen.  While Mr. Ruby deatils Geddy as a geek and Peart, he doesn't appreciate Rush's unique style.  Anyone who knows anything about playing a guitar knows that Alex is playing complex riffs that most players could only dream of.  Michael Ruby, excuse me for saying this, but this is not a step towards the progressive rock era, it is yet another masterpiece for [an excellent] band that would laugh at the idea of this album falling into the prog-rock category. Overall 5 atars!!!!!!
B00000JCEC|3.0|...It has some pretty good songs on it, most notably  \\"The Weight of the World\\", and a couple that are not so good. Who knows though, I may like it better after some more listens. But for now my verdict is: All in all, pleasant enough to listen to but not essential.
0440219078|5.0|This book, The Giver, was very entertaining and interesting. I enjoyed finding the ups and downs of a \\"perfect\\" world. This book talked about a boy who lived in a \\"perfect\\" world, and was discovering throught the special \\"assignment\\" given to him-the Receiver of memeories-that the life and world he had always know was not as wonderful as it appeared. He learned that sometimes you need to break the rules to achieve something. Overall, this was a very good book, and I highly recommend it.
B00005QIPH|4.0|At first listen I was not that impressed with this CD.  However I drove up Route 17 from NYC to Binghamton today and listened to this CD three times.   It got better with every listen.  Great driving guitar pop which draws from such diverse rock lumiaries as The Velvet Underground and Ultravox.  And then mixed with the rich and dirty taste of NYC.   <BR>The first four songs can be listened to over and over.   And each time I listen I like more of the songs.<br />My only negative is that the lead singer seems to be a little in love with his own snarls which can get in the way of the music.<BR>Buy it, listen to it.  You'll like it....
B000000OF6|5.0|If ever there was a bigger than life rock band that epitomized the meaning of &quot;Rock And Roll Band&quot;, it is Queen. No questions asked. Queen was incredibly different. They could have wild, loud rockers one minute, and the next they would have a pretty ballad, or even better, they would have some bizarre song that was filled with their british charm. Freddie Mercury was one of the greatest ever. They broke the mold when they made him. This 2 CD set is all that you need. It has everything you could possibly want. A review down below is laughable saying that a 2 CD set is too much. I guess that guy doesn't realize that the band has had a lot of songs. All of the classics are here. The arena rock of &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, &quot;I Want It All&quot;, and more. The ultimate classics in &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, &quot;We Are The Champions&quot;, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Under Pressure&quot;, &quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot;, and &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;. There are some songs on here that aren't on other greatest hits packages, like &quot;Breakthru&quot;, &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;, and &quot;Friends Will Be Friends&quot;. It would be great if there is an updated re-issue that includes some of the songs off their last album, &quot;Made In Heaven&quot;, back in 1995. The best thing about this band is that they didn't take this too seriously at all. It was all about the fun. The show. The performance. They were there to simply have fun and give people some entertainment. Their mission succeeded. The other good thing about this band is that they were good guys. Queen were also real trailblazers in music videos. Some of them were real cool and ahead of their time. Queen was more successful in the UK than in the U.S., but they did pretty darn good here. Sadly, the world lost one of the most influential frontmen and voices in rock history, when Freddie died in 1991 of AIDS at the age of 46.Such songs as &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, and &quot;These Are The Days Of Our Lives&quot;, were great and sad songs all at the same time. There will never be another one like him. One only wonders what fun and entertainment he could've given us in the future. We'll never know. A musical is in the works of the band. That should be interesting. So, here it is folks. A great introduction to the band. This is as good a place as any to start. Maybe the only place to go since Queen was more of a 'singles band' than an 'album band'. Get this and let Queen rock you. They are the champions.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Judging by some of the negative reviews, some people are obviously afraid to simply enjoy music for what it is- entertainment. Anytime I put on this cd, it sounds great - a real party cd. Prehaps it is slightly juvenile at times, but at the end of the day it is a cd packed with catchy tracks.  I guess a lot of people are slagging it off due to the popularity of the cd with all ages and genders. Same thing happened with Metallica when they 'sold out'.
B00003CXSP|2.0|I hope it is smarter then this. I saw this movie in the theater. Once was enough for me. I don't think I will bother with the best selling book eather. I loved &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, but &quot;Hannibal just seemed like one big horror cliche to me. Throwing lots of blood at a movie that's just for shock value is a good example. I also thought film sufferd form script rot. There lots of cheesey lines in &quot;Hannibal&quot;.<br />I was also let down by &quot;Manhunter&quot;. The movie that the &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; was remade by. Everyone thought it and the book &quot;Red Drogon&quot; was great.
0385484518|5.0|This book is very inspiring and a changing expierence in one mans<BR>life.  It is teaching to live your life to the best possible way you can,to enjoy the important things,the people,the love,not matieralistic things. This book makes you look at life differently,Morrie was a rare person who gave everything for the ones he loved,given his own hardship,he was the best person he could be till the end.
B00005A46T|4.0|I really liked Slipknot's self titled disk, but this one just as good. Just when you thought Corey's lyrics could not get anymore angry, or brutal. They did. The songs are way more polished on Iowa then on Slipknot's first CD. Slipknot have slowed down a bunch proving once and for all their not Death Metal. Yet the lyrics still got much more extreame. The reason I give this 4 stars is because Slipknot have certainly soldout here.<BR>Standout tracks for me are Disasterpeice, Skin Ticket, New Abortion, and \\"Iowa\\" which has very strange, brutal, and profound lyrics... The lyrics are printed on the disk its self behinde some really cool artwork.
B00005QDW1|1.0|While this album has a few bearable tracks on it, most songs are annoyingly repetitive and easily forgettable. It is nowhere near as infectious as the band's earlier releases. I'm embarrassed for No Doubt. ... Hopefully they will return to their roots for the next release.
B0000524CY|5.0|I love horror movies and this of course is one of my all time favoites. Willim Freikin and the special effects crew take no prisioners with strong gore and a realistic feeling of evil. To my supries the eleavation sceen near the end with the girl is very moving in my opinion. You must read the novel by William Peter Blady. One thing I must point out this the awsome acting. Ellen Burstyn gives this her very best as the mother. Max Von Sydow gives this his very best as the priest.
0393037010|5.0|Although I am not a sailor nor am I very knowledgeable about the navy, I do get a charge out of historical naval fiction. I read the Hornblower series by C.S. Forester with gusto, and was rather disappointed when I finished, because I thought that I had read the best books and there was nowhere to go but down.<br />Soon after, I saw a review of a Patrick O'Brian book and though he looked promising. I bought \\"Master and Commander\\" and started on it. I quickly realized that this was no Hornblower book.  I slowly struggled 3/4 of the way through it and decided it wasn't worth the effort. I just couldn't adjust to O'Brian's style: where Forester was straightforward and simple, O'Brian's writing style gets very involved, and sometimes his sentences take half a page. I dropped the book and forgot about it for several months, but for some reason I decided to give O'Brian another try. I started on a later book in the series, and found myself caught up in the story and enjoying the complicated prose. O'Brian's fascinating character development, not to mention the intense battle scenes and occasional bursts of subtle (or not) humor, was captivating. When I re-read \\"Master and Commander\\" I couldn't believe that I had been so obtuse on my first perusal; I LOVE this book now, and I know the book didn't change!<br />I know why a lot of people never really got into O'Brian (I was almost one of them), and I don't blame them. He is not easy to read, at least not at first. But when I got into the groove, so to speak, I found that I wouldn't rather have it any other way. I like the way O'Brian makes the reader work a little, and in the long run I think the payoffs are greater than in the Hornblower series. I know, a lot of people won't believe me, but I cannot tell a lie. O'Brian is better.
B00005YXZH|5.0|My expectations for the new Wilco album were through the roof before it even came out, and when I finally heard it all of my expectations were completely blown away.  Jeff Tweedy and Co. have outdone themselves.  If you're a Wilco fan, this album is a must have.  If you are not a Wilco fan, one listen and you will be.
B00005JKJA|5.0|You do not watch this movie, you experience it. So be prepared to watch it through in one sitting as that is how it should be seen--and there are no chapter stops.<br />Normally I hate this type of film. I like to come home and watch something with a beginning, a middle, and an end that ties everything together. But this movie makes you think. And the answers might not be the same for every viewer. David Lynch is not always, or even often, on target, but when he is--Hoo Boy. I walked around for the next two days trying to fit the individual scenes together. <br />I hope you have not read too much about the film prior to viewing and I certainly would not want to tell you anymore about it other than there is a haunting Spanish version of Crying in the pivital scene. Do not read anymore about it, go watch it.
6303314015|5.0|The story of the Lion King is perfect. Almost two perfect as they managed to compress the story into 87min.  The use of song fits perfectly and moves the story forward. The chracters are developed quickly and the viewer becomes attached imediatly. Great Movie!!!
0393314804|5.0|Trainspotting affected me as did &quot;Black Like Me&quot; - now I understand. I think that this book conveys true cultural insight - difficult task, rarely accomplished. Made me afraid to have a pint in Edinburgh, though.
B000005RFQ|5.0|There are many levels to Sabbath fans, from the casual \\"Para-nerds\\" to the completists that own EVERYTHING - \\"Eternal Idol\\" on vinyl, cassette, and CD.  Born Again is strictly for those that lean a little bit towards the latter category - they have already gotten all of the Ozzy albums and the first two with Dio (Heaven and Hell + Mob rules).  Most true Sabbath fans consider Born Again to be the last Black Sabbath album, as everyone except for Tony Iommi bailed the next year, in 1984.  Credit of course is due to Iommi for hanging on long after he should have, as the late 80's were none too kind.  The past decade or so has witnessed various reformations with various degrees of commercial failure.  Born Again was also their last album to show any life on the charts, as well.  This album was also maligned due to the changing climate of hard rock and metal in the early 80's.  The metal-parody film \\"Spinal Tap\\" came out around this time and the movie's depiction of self-important rockers setting up Stonehenge on-stage hit really close to home for Sabbath, who actually DID that.  Deep Purple's Ian Gillan was on-board as vocalist, which bothered Sabbath fans that couldn't grasp the concept of liking both bands.  It's really a shame that this album is so often ignored (some blame perhaps should go to the hilariously bad cover art, which is explained in the helpful/informative liner notes).  Ian Gillan's vocals take a little while to get used to but he more than makes up for it with his hilarious lyrics.  Poor Bill Ward's drum parts are excellent considering the condition he was in at the time.  Not only was poor Bill too ill to tour on the album, he couldn't even make it to the photo shoot!  Tony and Geezer Butler complement each other extremely well as always.  It's the two of them together that truly make Black Sabbath, as is evident by the fact that the non-Geezer albums are mired in tinniness.    The digitally-remastered version of Born Again brings numerous elements tolight that were previously hidden under the older, muddier version.  Everything is considerably crisper and the bottom end is particularly more well-defined.  The cymbals ring out more clearly, the bass drum is more present, the guitar tone is more resonant, the bass guitar is higher up in the mix and the vocals are easier to make out.  \\"Trashed\\" is the album's fastest song, which fits as it's about a drunken automobile accident.  The chorus is much brighter-sounding than on the old version and the subtle keyboards and backing vocals are more noticeable.  Ian sings the line \\"There was Peter and the Greenfly laughing like drains\\" - whatever that means!  Iommi's solo blazes and Bill Ward shows a deft sense of inner dynamics during the drum rolls at the bridge.  \\"Stonehenge\\" comes next, the first of two \\"ambient\\" tracks.  Tony's using the same effect left over from the intro to The Mob Rules, but by this time he'd mastered it.  It's actually beautiful and lush, especially on the new version.  \\"Disturbing the Priest\\" has an interesting, plodding, lurching riff that alternates between natural harmonics and flattening power chords.  The bass is much louder in this version and the guitar makes a really neat \\"yawning\\" sound over the verse.  The chorus anticipates some of the negative-space elements of Tony's playing that became more prevalant with subsequent albums (especially Headless Cross).  Ian's  vocals are particularly out of control here, as he shrieks and cackles demonically.  You can almost envision him disturbing a priest; throwing spit-balls, poking, prodding, prank-calling, etc.  \\"The Dark\\" is another ambient track like \\"Stonehenge\\" but it's significantly shorter.  It's basically a precursor to...  \\"Zero the Hero\\" - most consider this to be the best track on the album.  Even Cannibal Corpse covered it, which is extremely entertaining and available on their \\"Hammer Smashed Face\\" CD-single.  It starts off with a fade-in of Tony's patented unison bends before modulating up a key before the main riff comes in.  The riff is similar to \\"Paradise City\\" by Guns N' Roses, but not enough to call any lawyers.  This song probably has Gillan's best lyrics: \\"But the luv-a-duckin' way you're walkin' around...\\"; \\"...with a magic in their music as they eat raw liver...\\"; \\"You are the champion in the Acme farm book\\"(?!?!); etc.  \\"Digital b!+ch\\" is one of the first songs in the Sabbath catalog to employ the technique of alternating power chords with a pedal tone, which was more common in bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden.  A fairly pedestrian up-tempo rocker which is enjoyable if you can get past the misogynist overtones.  \\"Born Again\\" is the power ballad of the album, which begins with Tony's chorused-out guitar alternating between two chords with Geezer deftly filling in the gaps.  Ian's vocal performance is reminiscent of Deep Purple's \\"Child in Time\\" from their 1970 \\"In Rock\\" LP.  Great song, despite the fact that it seems as if Ian runs out of gas before it ends.  \\"Hot Line\\" is a bluesy, sleazy rocker that picks up midway through with a suspended-fourth to major-chord movement that sounds like a harmonic revelation amongst all these power chords!  The chorus is relatively dark and menacing, and it's a good song despite its roughshod arrangement.  \\"Keep it Warm\\" closes the album.  It starts out slowly, has a nice arpeggiated chorus and the coda is vaguely similar to \\"Dirty Women\\" from Technical Ecstacy.  This has one of the mathier sections on the album before an anti-lock brake shift back to the verse.  The actual compact disc has the cover image on it, employing a negative image in (fittingly) purple and black.  The booklet also contains some photos from the 1983 tour program, Ian's handwritten lyrics and a funny story about the album.  Okay, by now you should be convinced.  Buy it.
B00003CXRP|1.0|As someone who is fond of the South Pacific and the ocean in general, I was sure there would be something about this film that I might like. While there were some intriguing sequences of Tom Hanks trying to escape through a desolate island through the surf, the rest of the movie and the overall plot was so terribly corny that I left the theatre wishing I hadn't thrown away my hard-earned cash on this dribble drip-drop of a film. I guess you'd have to really love Tom Hanks to buy this DVD, and you'd also have to love films with weak plots and melodramatic overkill. <br />The biggest failure of this film is that it labored to set up a 'hero's journey' plot where someone enters the unkown, faces and conquers the forces death (or evil), then returns A CHANGED MAN. The problem is that character played by Tom Hanks comes back to society even more lost than when he was a castaway! I could care less about some insecure adult and his return from what could have been enlighteneing experience (but for whom it was like hell), only to follow around the first lady who catches his eye like a lost puppy dog. Tom Hanks looks so directionless about who he is and what his journey meant that his desperation for a 'soul-mate' upon his return comes off as just overly needy and sad.<br />I'm sure that many men of needy dispositon will love this film. As for me, I need my money back!
B000000WCA|5.0|Five years on from its'release, the Spice Girls' SPICE not only remains a true pop classic, but is justifiably credited with ushering in the resurgence of pop music that has yielded the likes of Backstreet, Britney, and all their soundalikes.  The opening salvo of 'Wannabe', 'Say You'll Be There', and '2 Become 1' still stands as one of the best one-two-three singles punches in recent memory, and if nothing here rises to the glorious level of those three, it's not for lack of trying. Both 'If U Can't Dance' and 'Who Do You Think You Are'are nearly a match for those three and of the remaining set,only the maudlin 'Mama'occasionally borders on skippable. Any true fan of unadulterated pop are committing a grievous error if they don't have this one in their collection--Britney and the like couldn't spin pop gold like this in their wildest dreams.
B00004XONN|1.0|Just when I thought the Disco Biscuits album &quot;They Missed the Perfume&quot; was the worst album I ever heard (That claimed to be original), Radiohead released this.  Ok Computer was just that, OK, but this album shows just how easy it is for mediocre musicians to pick up the label &quot;experimental&quot; to justify selling their meaningless meanderings to the public.  I've tried to be open minded towards this group, asking my friend to play it for me on various occasions.  Each time I can't help but want to throttle that whinny vocalist (He's NO singer) and ask the band just what the point is.  They just go nowhere.  Do yourself a favor, don't believe the people who Desperately want them to be the next Can, (This tripe will never be timeless, unless everyone loses their soul), listen to the Bends and appreciate it for what Radiohead really is-<br />A bunch of whinny rich people who accidentaly wrote half an album of alright tunes.
B00005LQ04|5.0|It's been a long time coming for this to hit DVD and the wait has been worth it .My first recollection of the film is sneaking downstairs late at night to watch it and being really creeped out by it .Many words have been written about the lighting and the soundtrack so I won't bore you with that . It's the overall feeling of the film that gets to people. The extras are fantastic,too many special editions that are put out aren't so special.
B00003CXB2|5.0|A sweeping, grand classic film spectacle is now available in a radiant new 2.2:1 DVD package. One of the last movies shot in Super Panasonic 70mm, 1962's \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is at once director David Lean's cinematic wedding of trenchant theater and stunning visuals.  T.E. Lawrence was a young World War I British soldier. Sent to deliver a message to King Feisal, he organizes various Arab tribes against the invading Turkish army. Sir Alec Guinness made 6 films under British director David Lean(including Guinness' first movie role). The finest of these is 1957's \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\". It's huge success prompted Lean and producer Sam Spiegel to try again. They did. 5 years later, \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" premiered in London. And, in 1965, Lean released \\"Dr. Zhivago\\". Curiously, all three films featured Alec Guinness, and all three addressed a character's human descent into madness. \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" stars Peter O'Toole, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, Jose Ferrer, Claude Rains, and the enigmatic newcomer Omar Sharif. But the real stars are the rich, red shimmering sand dunes of Jourdan, Morocco, and Spain. Toss in an unequaled muscial score by Maurice Jarre.  The \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" 2-disc DVD contains 4 featurettes, 3 trailers, and a marvelous documentary that interviews the late director, the star, and several cast members. Full-color scenes of Lean advising the actors on location is fascinating. No women. No sex. No CGI. Just brilliant, sweeping cinema splendor, captured quite intact from a bygone age....
B00005Y7AW|4.0|Well Rufus's cd begins with the song \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk\\" a whimsical and tell-tale sign to the kind of ironical recline rich in wainwright's voice and the languorous lyrical winks he makes at the listener throughout. Greek Song is a sun-flooded love tale, while \\"Poses\\" stretches itself out and combines an alacrity of wit with an unwinding sound. \\"Shadows\\", my initial least favorite, has now buttered by fancy and California is a minor classic of a song he haps does better in performance by pantomiming further the antecedents of the song, an ariel, quickly-fading putting on of airs in the sunburned pedantry of the place. <br />\\"The Tower of Learning\\" is an affecting mixture, with potent use of backing harmony and sharp lyrics. Grey Gardens has a fitting sample opening the petulant pout of his voice. His work on his father's \\"One Man Guy\\" is another charmer but shows most the lyrical abilites of his papa. On Rebel Prince the piano pops in nicely and there are swooning back vocals. <br />\\"The Consort\\" has some horns and hauteur to it and In A Graveyard is a wonderful little treat of a song, its softness not lessened by its quickness of escape. Someone unnecesarily added on a cover of Across the Universe and there is a hopped up reprise of \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk. I think less of the song \\"Evil Angel\\", a potentially grating biter. <br />The lyrics are all crammed inside this cd, a shame when they are so good, but they are worth going cross-eyed over. <br />MM,<br />April 24/02
0767817478|1.0|This 1998 version is so [bad] I can't even begin to tell you; but let me try...<br />This highly touted, highly flouted modern remake of an old classic has done a great disservice to its original prototype. In fact, this monster (and movie) should not even be called 'Godzilla', because it lacks all of the elements which made the origials so great... <br />This 1998 version of 'Godzilla' is like some over-teched video game mixed with a terrible plot and [bad]acting. I'm sorry but Gozilla is more than big chunk of pixels and graphics that destroys New Yrok City. Godzilla, the original, Japanese Godzilla at least, is a creature whose very clumsiness makes it more realistic, and is a monster who attacks, not to be the next biggest blockbuster hit, but due to a tragic bout with radiation poisoning. <br />Its such a shame when movies are remade into modern flops, and when great, almost mythical entitites such as Godzilla are molded into mere graphic toys for overly-confident, technocratic filmmakers and their money-making attemps. This film flopped. Get it? Godzilla is not merely a computer-generated toy, but a saga that is supposed to have a plot, a purpose, and at least a decent screenplay. You will not find any of those qualities with this flashy 1998 'attempted' remake. Get the original Japanese version instead, or you will really be missing out. ...
B000000WFF|5.0|Following up their successful SPICE within just ten months of that first album,  SPICEWORLD inexplicably manages to better their debut on many levels, not the least of which is an overall better set of songs and better singing.  Is there anything here that matches the pure fun of 'Wannabe'or'Say You'll Be There'?Nope,but the ten tracks here manage to consistently outdo their predecessor on just about every other level.  'Stop' is a sterling Motown stomper, while Latin vibes are mined on 'Spice Up Your Life' and 'Viva Forever', long before Ricky or J.Lo entered the pictured.  While the creative side got overall better grades at the time of its' release, there wasn't much airplay to be had, which is a shame considering that '..Life' and 'Stop' remain two of their best.
B000002B2X|5.0|If you are picky about your music, never fear Sap is the cd for your collection. If you have never heard AIC, you will love SAP.<BR>It may only be 4 songs long with one hidden gem, but its one of their best. Say farewell to Layne and company, and sit back and play this mellow beautiful cd in your car, you will fall in love. They mix the acoustic sound of Heart, Led Zeplin, and the Darkness of Soundgarden. So go get this cd, play it in your car and turn it up , You will sit back with a smile.....trust me.....

B00005JKQZ|4.0|Thus is the true story of mathmatical genius John Forbes Nash.  The character of Nash is portrayed brillantly by Academy Award-winner Russel Crowe.  Even if you hate him, you have to admit how incredible he was in this film.  The story tells about the life of Nash and how in his early life, developed schizapherenia (typo?).  While applying his mind, with the love of his wife Alicia, portrayed by the beautiful Jennifer Connolly, who won the Oscar for the role (not a terrific performance in my mind)he learn to fight this horrible illness.  But with a incredible script, crew and score, it is one the top five films of the year 2001.
0140177396|5.0|\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is about two men who try to survive in the middle of the Great Depression. George is a pretty normal guy, but his friend Lenny is retarded. They go around California looking for work, but everywhere they go Lenny does something that makes them leave. This is a great story of two men that have a great friendship that cannot be broken.<br />Steinbeck portrays the Depression vividly. He shows how people behaved and just treated other people. What people had to do to survive back then is crazy. Lenny is just an innocent bystander in this horrid time in our history. In that time there was no room for innocence. You fought to live or you died. I give this book five stars.
B000001EUN|4.0|ANIMAL MAGNETISM is the second Scorpions´s album featuring new lead guitarrist Matthias Jabs. It´s straight ahead har rock / metal, with the usual melodic lines used by the band. It´s a gem.<br />But this remastered version added nothing to the brilliantship of the album. It seems muffled.

B000050IE6|5.0|Opeth has been the deepest root of inspiration for me. If it were not for Opeth and Katatonia, I would never have picked up a guitar in the first place. It is Opeth's fourth album, Still Life, that shows their true magnificance. In my opinion, it is their best album, offering a lot of beautiful clean vocals from Mikael, as well as his roaring presence. The album opens with a very psychedelic feeling of just the guitars fading in until it an acoustic guitar display leads to all out brutatity. The band have definately reached a style that they have perfected; it is a unique sound and feeling that only Opeth eminates. Face of Melinda is an extremely beautiful song well worth the money paid for the entire album. If you are to only own one album from any artist, this would be it. But, I highly recommend the other four albums in their repertoire.
B00000JPH4|5.0|Okay, I realize that since I've already admitted that I love &quot;The Dark Crystal,&quot; my comments will be chalked down to the ravings of an obsessed fan.  So here goes.  I read a review that claimed the main character, Jen, was &quot;a brat&quot; because he chided Fizzgig for barking as they were looking for Kira in the tunnels underneath the Skeksis castle.  Would a &quot;brat&quot; have been as wracked with guilt as Jen was when he thought he had led the Garthim to the podling village?  Would a brat have so desperately tried to save the one he loved, as Jen did when he offered to trade the crystal shard in exchange for Kira's life, even though he knew it would spell doom for himself and everyone else?  And finally, would a brat have undertaken such a life-threatening quest with only minimal complaint?  Don't make such insulting comments unless you are prepared to back them up with more than ONE instance!
B0000027EP|4.0|I know it may hurt, I know its painful, but the truth is that 1916, due to better production devices available in the nineties, is a better album than the ones of the famous Eddie Clarke era.<BR>And as for the tittle-track, I have only one thing to say to the new Gods Of Arrogance (Metallica): if they think that they recorded the ultimate anti-war rock song in ONE, well, they should listen to 1916... What a song, man!!!!
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew W.K. is not trying to change the world. He is not trying to be insightful. He is not trying to make a statement. He is simply creating the music that he loves, and having fun doing it. You say his music is focused on partying? That's what he wants. His songs are about loving life, fun, women, and music. He lives life in the now and wants to share that love of life with you, the listener, through his music. No tricks, no jokes. Pure, unadulterated fun. <br />His live shows are amazing, the crowd feeding off of his energy and love and sending it back to him, echoing and reverberating around until everyone is bouncing, smiling, high-fiving and screaming in sheer bliss. Good times.
B00005RYL9|3.0|I bought this immortal edition hoping that the audio would be better than the previous DVD so imagine my surprise that it still is not that great. I have to turn the volume way up to hear the dialogue then down when the music is on. Why can't anyone seem to get it right with this movie?? I even tried different audio settings on both the DVD and my television. Next time they try to release this as improved-I'm saving my money and renting it first.
0451526015|3.0|&quot;Picture of Dorian Gray&quot; was a cleverly written book with very descriptive laungage. The book takes place over a span of about 20 years, in which the reader sees the transformation of the title character, Dorian Gray. He goes from an innocent boy of about twenty, to a cruel, consciounless man with the appearance of a twenty year old. While the book was entertaining and provided enough description to keep the reader amused, Wilde overdid it at some points, providing too much added information that took away from the simple plot of the novel. Over all though, it was a good book.

0930289234|5.0|Others have already said how amazing this book is, so I won't really bother.  I'll just say that I have bought copies of this book for my friends so that they can see how great comic books can be as a storytelling medium.  Speaking of which, I should note that a certain Ivy League school in upstate New York has used Watchmen as a CLASS TEXT for a freshman writing seminar class.  It was used to demonstrate classic literary devices.  This definitely ain't your average comic book.  :)  By the way, when I first read Watchmen, it was in the early 90s (when I was a senior in high school), and I had borrowed it from my friend, along with a tape of Lenny Kravitz's &quot;Mama Said&quot; album.  I gotta say, those two are perfect for each other.  In my mind, the Lenny Kravitz album is like the perfect background score for Watchmen.  You might wanna try it too.  :)

0783225792|5.0|First off, quick synopsis: Mob tries to run casino in vegas, deniro tries to run it straight and handles the actual business end, and peschi simply handles the &quot;business&quot; end...if you know what i mean.  Deniro deals with the goods and peschi handles the streets; the two are long time friends but better not cross each other.  what follows is a series of wild and unpredictable events and some great characters.  this movie is great because it has three sides to it: (1)the informative side, where at times it plays almost like a documentary(with great cinematography and editing), and we get to learn a lot about how casino's work and how the mafia operated precisely within them, (2)the character interaction side, which means we have great actors with great dialogue and great scenes, we get a lot of input on the relationships of these people and a lot about real family life and character devolopement, and (3)the &quot;business&quot; end, which is all sorts of action sequences and powerful scenes, where we get to see the mafia boys go to work.  Now, this is just a plain great movie, and it hits on a lot of angles while being completely interesting all the time and gripping part of the time.  Why is Casino better than Goodfellas?  REASON 1: Deniro is on top of his game.  Some may say he's alway's great, but I disagree, sometimes he glides through his roles(i.e. bronx tale, the score), as opposed to when he's on(raging bull, heat).  In Casino he's on.  His performance is much more wide ranging and even sympathetic, and during the last third he REALLY gets into his role.  It is absolutely great to watch.  But in Goodfellas, it's just so-so.  He basically seems only mildly interested, and his character is nowhere near as interesting and memorable as in Casino.  REASON 2: unique setting and premise.  almost all mafia movie's take place in new york or some other big city, but here we're thrown into the flashy world of gambling, money, and lights, las vegas, and the desolate surrounding desert where so many bodies are buried.  you really get the feeling that these guys are out on their own, in an island of glitz, set to either do good or get wacked, and are completely surrounded by a barren and uncharted landscape.  just this interesting premise makes the movie sound fresh, such as when so much of the city is like uncharted territory for mobs and peschi goes on a diamond robbing hunt like its the old west and starts opening up shops.  REASON 3: great female lead performance.  say what you want about lorraine braco, but sharon stone is so good at getting you to want to just through her down a flight of stairs(that may sound violent but wait to you see the ---- she pulls) that her performance is wholey memorable.  she is charismatic, two timing, greedy, seductive, irresponsible, and dependent(on numerous things).  overall, you will definately remember her.  REASON 4: the information angle.  as we discussed before, CASINO frequently plays like a documentary, especially in the beginning.  It is so interesting and informative, while also managing to be entertaining, that you've got to be impressed(just look at the creative film work that scrocese pulls off while taking us through the casino).  REASON 5: not as depressing.  In Goodfellas we get to see friendships fall apart, business fall apart, and basically everything go down the drain and everyone become sad and/or disillusioned.  well, hmmmm...a lot of that happens in casino as well, BUT--there's a difference, and that difference is the &quot;tone&quot;.  CASINO is more lighthearted and takes joy in the filmaking and storytelling.  a lot of it's serious but it's frequently told with a slight feeling of tongue and cheek amusement, which makes everything more fun and less of a downer, while still allowing the drama to play off expertly.  overall, when i finished casino, i felt simultaneously satisfied by the film and the performances while informed by the information it shared.  CASINOis really a great movie, and one that can be appreciated on many levels.

0385503954|1.0|Ageing starry-eyed yuppies will eat this solipsistic-self infatuated sugar tart of a book right up as it's passed from sweaty palm to palm through all the precious literary boutiques frequented by urban liberal elites. The snob appeal is impressive; every faddish academic/critic will want one to maintain good social odor with their colleagues, dour men of letters who missed out on the Nobel Prize who specialize in the sexual anxieties of financial planners (zzzzz), and trendy California newspapers soliciting manuscripts for 30 something movie studio executives who crave \\"serious\\" recognition and full page advertising for Oscar nominations. Those who believe the life-style choices of arrogant prep school frat boys is anything but the posturing of conceited social climbers will enjoy this trashy melodrama. A contrived, pretentious bore of a novel.
B00003CXSP|5.0|The book is not perfect. Yet, the film is as close to perfect as one could possibly hope for especially with all things considered such as: the major handicaps of the Silence of the Lambs (book and movie); no Jodie Foster; no sensational shocks, mostly just surprises. Between the book Hannibal and the film, the film won me over with a major margin over the book because of a single element. The ending. I firmly believe that the ending of this film was perfect because it conveyed exactly and conclusively what was there all along in The Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal Lecter's love and regard for Clarice Starling is far purer that any of his heinous acts of contempt for his enemies. Admittedly, it is rather difficult for any viewer to extract the very obscure acts of love from the sea of overwhelming horror created by Hannibal Lecter. Yes, Hannibal does have a rather awkward way of showing a gal how much he adores her as displayed in the scene when he brings Clarice's worst enemy to dinner. It is rather like your darling cat bringing you a half-dead mouse as a token of his unwavering affection. Only bigger, much, much bigger.<br />Hannibal's love for Clarice could never be realistically expected to bring him much in the way of eternal salvation. Yet we sense that he was somewhat less destructive during his \\"retirement\\" and perhaps for having known her. The only thing that appeared to set him off again was his renewed pursuit by people trying to make big money by his capture. Well, after his little talk with the Italian scholars about the equivalency of avarice and death (a medieval ideal) and the restrained but touching passion with which he conveyed this concept, it should have come as no surprise to the Commendatore Pazzi that tangling with Hannibal was not worth the lire. Not if you valued your innards more than your reputation. And speaking of past records, especially considering Hannibal's reputation.<br />See the film for the acts of love. Anthony Hopkins and Julianna Moore pull off the toughest acting assignment any actor could ever hope to achieve with such breathtaking grace and poetry. It is well worth enduring the stomach-turning scenes throughout the film to see the final interaction of Hannibal and Clarice. It is all about love and self-acceptance.

B000063DHL|4.0|Somewhere in time is a brilliant follow up album to 'Powerslave'. By creating Powerslave, Maiden had reached the peak of its blistering metal creativity.<BR>With somewhere in time, they added a synth sound to the band (guitar synth), and the effect on their music is dramatic. <BR>This album  covers a wide spectrum with chainsaw metal tracks like 'caught somewhere in time', 'wasted years', 'sea of madness', and reveals its melancholy moments with tracks like 'stranger in a strange land'. Adrian Smith stamps his influence on many compositions coming up with brilliant leads, and riffs that keep the listener glued. Probably, Alexander the great is a slightly grandiose offering, but nevertheless, the smith-murray combination creates a beautiful aural landscape that is almost operatic. Perhaps the one thing that stops this album from achieving a 5 star rating is its production value. This was probably Maiden's most expensively produced album at that point in time, and it has a finely polished feel to it. The rough edge of Powerslave is missing, but nevertheless its a magnificent record. <BR>Buy this album.
B0000640VO|5.0|I have already reviewed Amelie at Amazon's UK site, but that was after only one viewing (at the cinema), but I have now seen it a few more times after buying the (UK) DVD.<br />Needless to say, I still think this film is utterly brilliant. Having now seen Amelie 3 times I'm prepared to say it's definitely my favourite foreign language/subtitled film ever, surpassing previous favourites of mine like Life is beautiful & Cinema Paradiso. More importantly though, Amelie is fast becoming one of my all-time fave movies of ANY kind - regardless of the country of origin.<br />I won't bore you with the story, as you have in excess of 200 other reviews here you can get that from!, but just wanted to say a few points about the movie; Audrey Tautou is simply wonderful in the lead role, the film has a fantastic opening sequence with Amelie as a young girl, it is full of uplifting moments (like when the man finds his childhood treasure box in the phone booth), it is vibrant in colour and has a great visual style, and a superb soundtrack by Yann Tiersen which fits the film perfectly...Amelie is simply a wonderful film that deserves to be seen by as many people as possible, even those that don't normally watch subtitled movies.
078322799X|5.0|I've never understood why this movie did so poorly at the box office but this is one of the most underappreciated films I've ever seen.  The movie begins with a lot of humor and only an undertone of menace.  As it progresses, the danger level and intensity gradually get cranked up to major proportions.<br />Michael J Fox is great but the movie is filled with characters that are unique, three dimensional, and well acted.  About the only reservations I have in recommending this movie universally is if you don't like getting scared or if you don't like any humor mixed in with your horror then you probably should look elsewhere.  For anyone else, enjoy!
B00005Y228|1.0|&quot;can't get you out of my head&quot; is without a doubt, one of the most annoying songs I've ever heard. Kylie Minogue is way too old to be a pop star, and someone should tell her to coverup!
0684800713|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of Hemingways masterpieces and I rate this as one the finest books I've read to date.  The way he incorporates his characters into the novel is unsurpassed, or maybe it is the lack of character that makes this a classic.<BR>  The Sun Also Rises is a must have and buying this book is suggested for all readers alike.  I can safely say this should be one of the Hemingway titles you should try out along with To Whom the Bell Tolls.  Simply a masterpiece!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I was lucky enough to get to see this in the theater and it rocked.  You leave with what I refer to as the &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; feeling: you almost know what went on, but not quite.  If you buy a copy and get to watch it again, you feel like you know the deal, but it never stops being intriguing.<br />Trust me, there's a reason why it slid into the IMDB.com top 10 of all time even though it was never released to a lot of theaters.<br />Carrie-Anne Moss may have already staked her claim in the biz with the Matrix movies, but you can now expect to see huge things from Guy Pearce and Christopher Nolan as well.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie beat Shrek hands down! What was the Academy thinking when they gave Shrek the oscar...Oh, that's right...the Academy NEVER thinks! Buy Monsters, Inc. no matter what your age. You'll watch it over and over again! I know I plan to.
B000005JA8|5.0|Though many reviewers say it will probably take awhile to &quot;get&quot; this man's (and bands) increadible music, i couldn't stop smiling the first time i played it.  This was my first experience with Captain Beefheart, (i only bought it for the CD cover) and i am amazed at how little understanding and respect this man gets, if not from his own peers, then from post-punk musicians and indie rockers, etc...THIS RECORD iS Beautiful...it is fun and crazy and gets your creative juices flowing...give this record a spin and let yourself be spun into a world of space-bound poetry and musical madness.
B00004T9UF|5.0|... The Marshall Mathers cd is just as brilliant as The Slim Shady cd.   My personal favorite is Under The Influence, ...  Another one, that I think E is directing to the bullies and others that tormented him as a child, is Remember Me?.  Criminal, Marshall Mathers, I'm Back, etc., are all excellent songs as well.  So, if you want to hear some of the best lyrics ever recorded, get this cd.  If not then go get the Backstreet Boys or N'sync, they might be more on your level.  Remember, don't judge other people when you have no idea what kind of life they have led.  Oh yeah, just wanted to give a quick kudos to Dr. Dre, for discovering the most talented rapper to ever come along, and for taking a chance with him so we all can enjoy his music. Thanks Dre. he really adresses the point of the lyrics in these songs. ofcourse the hit &quot;the real slim shady&quot; is unhatable and i could go on about it all day but all i can say is i would give it 5 stars. i would give every single song on this album 5 stars, judging the lyrical content and the beats. they are all great. songs like &quot;kim&quot; are shocking but it makes you realise that stuff like abuse happens and it shouldn't. &quot;stan&quot; is just a great example of copy-cat fans and is a crude reminder to fans that EMINEM shouldn't be copied, whether his songs are jokes or not. in &quot;stan&quot;, the angry fan copies what EMINEM did in &quot;kim&quot;. even if &quot;stan&quot; is a lesson for fans, it's the most creative and brilliantly written song i've ever heard in my life. buy this album, it will blow you away after you have gotten over the offensiveness of his words. and if you actually find it too offensive, then, this is a message from EMINEM... &quot;GO AHEAD!! SUE ME!!!&quot; but it won't get you anywhere and as if he would care if he got sent to jail anyway. have a great time listening to this album. enjoy. by Nobby the Great
B00000J7RZ|5.0|Jen did a great job with this project. This album is very the best:-) I luv it sooo much!!!! Jennifer is one of my favorite singers.

0395925037|5.0|One word: Genius. This book revealed the true genius that Adolf Hitler truly was. Mein Kampf is quite possibly one of the most controversial, and followed, manuscripts of the 20th century, and he was without a doubt, a very respectable military figure. I almost wish he had written more books, because this one showed an insight into this man-a man that cast a shadow over the world and still has a legacy decades later. Who wouldn't want to know what made Adolf Hitler tick? Mein Kampf just goes to show you that what you think can never happen can.
B00004RYZT|5.0|We have got quite a collection of DVD movies and a couple of music consert dvds but truthfully my sons and I have watched this DVD at least 75 times. We did see them live in Madison,WI but they were not headlining and their show was only a little over an hour. One word---Pyrotechnics.
0064407667|5.0|Quoting from the opening of Chapter 7: \\"There are many, many types of books in the world, which makes good sense, because there are many, many types of people, and everybody wants to read something different. For instance, people who hate stories in which terrible things happen to small children should put this book down immediately.\\" And they certainly do. The Baudelaire children -- fourteen-year-old Violet, twelve-year-old Klaus, and their infant sister, Sunny -- are off at the beach one day when Mr. Poe the banker comes to tell them that their loving parents have perished tragically in a fire and that their mansion has been utterly destroyed. They will have to go and live with Count Olaf, their (geographically) nearest relative, until Violet is old enough to inherit. He's a horrid, dirty, smelly, scheming, dangerous man, and an actor to boot. Their life there is terrible, even with the kind Justice Strauss and her lovely library next door. And then Count Olaf begins making plans to get his hands on their fortune. The author (whose real name is Daniel Handler) is obviously perverse and possibly deranged, and I love his work; it's hard to tell, sometimes, whether he's really writing for kids or for weird adults. This is the first of a projected thirteen volumes, and all of them are going on my Edward Gorey shelf.
6301871952|1.0|this movie whas ok! Not as good as the first one but still ok.<BR>There are a lot more Gremlins and so three evil gizmos.<BR>Eaven with all this treat,the movie gets pretty borring after a while so i think Gremlins1 will Setersfie you a lot moure.
B000003CMB|5.0|The best Allman Bros album, one of the best albums of all time and quite possibly the best rock live album ever! Everything you have heard about this album is true. Duane is one of the best guitar players ever, and this album is proof. An album to be proud to own, really.
0375751513|3.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray was a hard novel to get into. But once the plot of the story got underway it transfolded into a page turning, mind questioning story. Wilde tells us the story of a beautiful man who wishes that his soul would forever be part of his self portrait, and that he will forever stay youthful. Little to say, his wish comes true. Though there were many parts of the story that seemed to be described in quite a bit of unwanted detail, they almost give the novel a sense of philosophy. This compliments the many complicated philosophical views of Lord Henry, one of the main characters in the work. As the story progressed I found myself being pulled into the plot. When Dorian fell in love with Sibyl Vane I anticipated each turn of events that followed. Since we know about Dorian Gray's wish, each chapter teases us as to what will happen to him. Throughout the rest of his life, Dorian involuntarily causes accidents and grief to others. From Sibyl's death to the suicide of Alan Campbell, things always turn tragic for the ones in his life. It is inevitable that Dorian will meet his own death by the time the novel finishes. The conclusion to the story couldn't have been done better. The way that Wilde closes the life of Dorian Gray is perfectly written, and paints a perfect \\"portrait\\" in our minds as well.
B000005H7D|5.0|I don't consider this album to be a strong contender for the best Coltrane album, and yet it is magnificent and an essential jazz album. The compositions are great and Trane plays at his best. All the essays, interviews, extra track, video, etc., contained in this version make it a real bargain. Owning any other version of this album is now absurd. Has Blue Note overhyped 'Blue Trane'? Maybe. But this is Trane at his best, you cant go wrong.
B0000542D1|5.0|The Beatles first movie was a great success.  The lines are funny and it's great to see them in action.  Compared to their other films this one makes the top of my list.  Listen for the best line, \\"I now declare this bridge open.\\" It's all smiles and laughs; it's a must see film!  Don't miss the re-release!
0767812166|3.0|Starman is spoiled by director John Carpenter's penchant for throwaway jokes.It could and should have been better.<BR>For example,when Karen Allen's character is asked to define love,she puts in a really moving performance only to have the scene spoiled by a silly joke at the end.<BR>In the finale,a silly scene of Bridges kissing a man is another throway joke that spoils the ending.<BR>Despite this,Starman is still a good film.
