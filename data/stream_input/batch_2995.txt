B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Update, 12.20.2013:<br /><br />With additional content partners launched and improvements to the tab casting experience, I now wholeheartedly give Chromecast a 5 star rating, up from the 4 stars at launch.<br /><br />------------------------------------<br />Original Review.<br /><br />This is a brilliant concept and execution- mostly- with a few rough edges and limited content options.<br /><br />Setup will be easy for anyone using a laptop or system with built-in wifi card. Don't try to use a desktop you've connected by ethernet that doesn't have a wireless connection- you'll get an unhelpful message about VPN, although calling google support was a better support experience than anticipated.<br /><br />As a internet streaming device, it is probably the best option on the market for adding \\"smart tv\\" functions for web streaming to the millions of early HDTV's that didn't have this feature.  Due to the clever integration with Netflix and YouTube across Android, iOS, and any browser, using Chromecast is very convenient.  Lost the remote? Just grab your next internet connected device- VERY nice.<br /><br />People who have an xbox and can use that for streaming- IF they pay for xbox gold- Chromecast can be an attractive option VS.  paying for gold. People who have netflix and or youtube access via blu-ray or other interfaces may be won over by the ability to use basically any internet enabled device as a remote- and i'm thinking this is a clever way to facilitate second screen experiences as well.<br /><br />It'll be interesting to see if Chromecast gets other content providers like Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc. to start delivering their content this way- that's probably the biggest reason NOT to buy a chromecast- in terms of video, don't count on playing it unless it's on yotube or netflix.<br /><br />the tab casting experience nearly gets the product dropped to 3 stars for me, as it is atrocious- but google did a really great job with the two content providers they support, so overall it's a 4.  even on a gigabit wired network with a high-end access point less than 10 feet from the Chromecast, the video streaming performance was pathetic.  i've been an IT pro for over 5 years, and this really was one of the least impressive features i've seen go live- music and photo tab casting worked when I browse to local files in chrome, but videos were awful even after dropping quality to the lowest settings.<br /><br />It's frustrating the feature I was most interested in- \\"tab casting\\" my own content was basically unusable- so I really hope google puts in the work to improve this feature- although to be fair when streaming internet content chrome cast really shines.t, so overall it's a 4.  even on a gigabit wired network with a high-end access point less than 10 feet from the Chromecast, the video streaming performance was pathetic.  i've been an IT pro for over 5 years, and this really was one of the least impressive features i've seen go live- music and photo tab casting worked when I browse to local files in chrome, but videos were awful even after dropping quality to the lowest settings.<br /><br />It's frustrating the feature I was most interested in- \\"tab casting\\" my own content was basically unusable- so I really hope google puts in the work to improve this feature- although to be fair when streaming internet content chrome cast really shines.

B008JFUR10|1.0|Whom every wrote this, and directed should take another class or two in how to write a movie that has some common sense in it.  This was a dumb movie, which could have been better written and a waste of good money.  I could go into detail, but I want you all to waste some of your money as I did.  Just not entertaining, lousy acting, and some of the parts don't come together as plausible even if it is a make believe movie.  I cannot recommend this to anyone, even if you are a die hard science fiction fanatic.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|A game like cubis meets a rubics cube meets mahjong I love it and the different camera angles so that's that
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|Just another actors fathers kid given a movie part.  Just another kid coming of age movie.  What more can I say.  Each minute of the movie, I wanted to ring that kids neck for being a big baby.  Not entertaining at all.  Had to turn it off and waste of some hard earned money.  I should have listened to the other lousy threads but didn't.  Shame on me

B007VDN1PA|5.0|This little gem does exactly as described, and is very easy to operate. Any doubts I had prior to ordering it, were erased as soon as I put the first negatives through it. I would recommend this item for anyone wishing to save images from old negatives for posterity.  I have no regrets and it is definitely worth the price.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not my first choice for a read.  Read for a book club.  I prefer nonfiction but this was OK.  Wanted to get to the end to find out the answers but was tough at times because the main characters were so devious and nasty.

B001EBV0OY|5.0|First I'd just like to say I don't why this did not win best picture. Forrest Gump is a good movie but nowhere to compare to this. This also have to be the best Stephen King movie ever.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very addictive but you need to wait for energy to continue the game but still entertaining worth playing .lots of different scenes to explore , a must if you like to play hidden object games.
B001XVD2Z0|1.0|While the movie appears to be super, the amazon experience was a disaster.  I live on a ranch and don't have cable and only internet is via Verizon...It took over 2 hours to stream the first 22 minutes of the  movie...I tried to stream it over night and watch it the next day and still I could not get it to stream over 20 seconds at a time...I used pause to see if it would buffer but no luck...I have used Netflix in the past and was able to watch movies so not sure why this one from Amazon would not stream but 20 seconds at a time.<br /><br />Guess living in a rural area has it's advantages as well as disadvantages.

B00EMJD6TC|4.0|Not much into zombie movies, but this one was pretty cool. I wonder if they'll do a part two? I hope so.
B00FPH6M82|4.0|You know, there are many reasons people rate movies poorly other than the movie sucking itself. I think unfortunately because of M. Night Shyamalan as a director and Jaden Smith as the main character, whom most people feel has his career in acting due to his fathers clout, this movie has been received with a bit of negative Bias. Now, I have seen some pretty sorry movies over the years. If you ignore the bias and look at the movie objectively without consideration of cast and crew, this wasn't a sorry movie. The very first part of the story is a bit weak. Not enough character introduction was shown to get you involved in the characters lives. I am thinking the scenes that lead up to the son's dismissal were cut leaving a gap that isn't properly explained. It gives no visual representation of why Kitai (Jaden Smith) was cut from the ranks of the graduating rangers. Probably due to the finished product of those scenes not meeting the quality requirements. they were probably not filmed again due to costs. Other than this, the acting was watchable and the story (A survival story) was good and reasonably believable based on the level of technology shown during the movie and the amount of time in the future (Enough time to develop faster than light interstellar travel, find a new world to live in, run from a hostile planet that had evolved in many ways to kill humans and live 1000 years after that time). In other words a distant future. The special affects were good and believable enough to keep you involved but not spectacular.<br /><br />The theme of the story is the understanding that fear is not real except in ones mind but danger is. That you can overcome the danger if you overcome your fear and learn to think clearly instead of letting fear cause you to panic and ultimately cause you to make a very fatal mistake. Not a bad survivalist way to think and live. I think the story gets this point across nicely. General Raige's son Kitai learns this as he goes to retrievethe second emergency beacon in the tail end of the crashed ship averting many dangers and barely surviving some. The ship is approximately 2 days away. Kitai's father is struggling to stay alive with 2 badly broken legs, one with arterial damage. The large bird part of the story is a bit hard to believe but, I guess it could be possible if these animals have had the time to evolve and become more intelligent. The final fight with the Ursa was done well. It brings a climax and nice ending showing the theme to the movie in action. That's what I saw. Judge for yourself, renting here in HD is only $5.99 with tax. Hope this review helps people decide.

B0009K7RES|3.0|Love Mark Knopfler but this album was just ok.  Several songs were good but nothing great like some of his other albums.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I felt that the book did not hold my attention, it was slow getting to the point.  But that could just me.  I really like more intrigue
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I rarely use ebay on any other device than my laptop but this one does the job. Pretty simple and effective.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|I expected this movie to be another childish 3D animation with over-the-top fantasy elements and more than a few silly talking animals; I was surprised to find a thoughtfully-done, interesting story, with magic that was often understated, and a historical realistic feel.<br /><br />The story contains some of the familiar elements: magic, a witch, and a princess trying to escape her royal duty, but at its core this is a story of a mother/daughter relationship and a rebellious teenage girl growing up.<br /><br />This is my favorite 3D animated. It manages to strike the perfect balance between adventure, humor, and deeper meaning.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It is just like the app on my phone. And the tile on my laptop. And desktop. Nothing really too special about this version so it's kind of like the rest.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|excellent transaction shipped as stated, nice product will re-order again
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I set the alarm but it never went off in the morning because it goes into sleep mode.  So in order to use this app, I would have to leave my kindle on plugged in and have to turn sleep mode on and off every time I want to use it.  So what is the point in having an alarm clock that does not go off???<br /><br />Stupid.
B000I0XLYO|5.0|lot of great one liners in this--well worth the watch.  the ben stiller and owen wilson tandem is well awesome.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|along with the rest of the series, is hard to put down, I think I read all the books in the series in less than a day.  Everything got put on hold while reading of these novels the love between Rose, Demetri, and the loyalty to Lissa her best friend.  The last blood heir to the dragomir line.  The altercations and situations in this book test Rose to her limits.  Very suspenseful I highly suggest this book.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|This is one album that I've been waiting for so long to get so I could how this album will sound
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|when I read a supernatural book I love books that have everything from vampires to sea monsters, to ancient greek gods, and then throw in history characters Billy the Kid, Shakespeare, Joan of Arc.  Really what is not to love about this series, In the first book you are introduced to Nicholas Flemel his wife and the twins along with the villain of the story!  It is suspenseful from the beginning to the end.  Make sure you have the second novel handy you won't want to wait.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I loved every song on this album and I have listened to it over and over and I do not get tired of this new Avenged Sevenfold contribution. I advise everyone that loves metal to purchase this album. I think anyone that purchases this album will love it. It is typical Avenged Sevenfold music and you will not be disappointed with this purchase. Enjoy!
6305307261|4.0|Nosferatu: The Vampire<br /><br />I just got Werner Herzog's Nosferatu: The Vampyre (Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht). I'm 30 min's in & I can tell you this is a marvelous Dracula movie. It is faithful to the source material (except for the closing scene)but with Herzog at the controls & color available (though little used) it is the visual embodiment of the story of Dracula. Herzog is the world's best Documentarian & you wouldn't think that would lead to great fiction. In his case it does. He directed Aguirre: The Wrath of God & Fitzcarraldo along with many others including, Signs of Life. It's images, images, images conceived in such a way as to perfectly portray his subject matter & give rise in his viewer to what is going on in that character mentally & emotionally. No one is his equal at this. Back to the movie which anyone would not believe a man whose fame grew from documentaries would be capable of in a horror story. This is Halloween the holiday in a disc folks.<br /><br />Finished it & I must say what an achievement. There is not one scene of violence in the whole movie unless you call Jonathan Harker nicking his finger at the dinner table violence. The ending scene strangely does not remotely follow the book & I will dock it a full point. 1/2 for not following the book & 1/2 because to me, the ending scene is the weakest part of the story. Dracula seems to be completely unaware of when crosses (supposed to cause Dracula great pain) are in the scene. Drac carries his coffin through a graveyard of crosses with no reaction then, when he puts his coffin down he turns & sees 2 that are 1/10 the size & cowers. When Drac visits Lucy in her bedroom she is wearing a silver cross (extremely potent) but Drac has no reaction again. I don't understand or forgive that. It is the first mistake of that magnitude I've seen in any of his films.<br /><br />I can just hear the world's blood & gore horror crowd complaining about this atmospheric & apprehensive Dracula. The opening scene is perhaps the finest in the Horror genre. There is no blood at all to speak of. There is no crescendo after crescendo of horror. What there is is an oppressive & brooding sense of evil that is eminent, which never goes away, but carries throughout the common scenes as well as the uncommon encounters. I loved it. 8.5 out of 10 stars. Did I mention I was PO'ed about the crosses? Except for that though, the scene construction is superbly Herzog. I loved his use of music too.<br /><br />XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br /><br />My wife came home early to say, &#34;Let's watch Nosferatu with Klaus. I allowed my arm to be twisted. I also came up with another dissatisfaction. It's the character of Van Helsing. I understand they were intent on showing Dracula as a sympathetic character & to have a monomaniacal foe of all that's holy would be counterproductive. The milk-toast they make of him though is just wrong. This one is not the Dr. that rides in as help in a time of trouble. He is rather the epitome of the country Dr. Many have done this story with no Van Helsing at all & I think that would have been better. Keep the character that they used but don't call him Van Helsing. I'll deduct another 1/2 point for that & make it 8 out of 10 stars after a second viewing. As my wife said after seeing it, &#34;Aguirre was 10 out of 10. This one isn't, yet the imagery is as good & the brooding evil never leaves.&#34;<br /><br />Nosferatu: The Vampyre (English version)<br /><br />On my disc it isn't cut at all. Not even one scene. The English version comes from a dirtier source print. Snow is bad at the beginning & slowly fades for about 20-25 min's then it is gone. I didn't notice a whole lot of camera angle changes but what was evident was an overall use of slightly less light. You can really see that in the backlighting of Count Dracula as he walks down the corridor to Jonathon Harker'sroom. It is noticeable throughout however. It steals the sheen off of fabrics causing it to appear less contrast was used. The ending doesn't change at all.<br /><br />My wife pointed out & I agree that Shadow of the Vampire is better done. Max Schreck in that is as eerie & imposing with more latitude given for intensity. Willem Defoe against Klaus Kinski is a &#34;can't lose&#34; match on maniacal expression & I'll see both of these many times over the years. Imagery goes to Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht but consistency of storyline goes to Shadow of the Vampire.fabrics causing it to appear less contrast was used. The ending doesn't change at all.

B00D8HNR2K|4.0|This album is more what I would expect from Nine Inch Nails. I think that it goes back to more typical roots of this band's music. I liked this album although some songs took a little getting used to, but if you listen, you will grow to like this album and the music. Not quite Pretty  Hate Machine, but very close.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|At first this book moved a little slow, but then BAM! I was so unprepared for the giant book-changing revelations - I completely did not see it coming! Sky is your everyday 17 year old who's mother died at the age of 3 and was adopted after her father gave her up. Sky's adoptive mother is a bit of an earthy eccentric who doesn't believe in the wastefulness of technology, so no phone, TV, internet, etc. She also home school's Sky, but Sky insists she attend high school her senior year. Dean Holder, who goes by Holder, has been away for the last year after his twin sister committed suicide. Holder has a reputation as the bad boy. Something about him draws him to Sky, bringing up snippets of past memories she barely remembers, and something about her immediately draws her to Holden - almost to the point of obsession. It's not until the day Holder sees a bracelet Sky is wearing that this book takes on a life of its own. There is so much more I want to say, but I can't give away the intensity of this book! Sometimes discovering the truth can leave you more hopeless than believing the lies... Put it on your list, ladies!!!
B0065CCM76|5.0|Excellent. You used to really need talent to sell music, most of the new  stuff , is just noise. It's real talent.

Travis Maddox was the womanizing, tatooed fighter bad boy who finally met a woman that didn't fall at his feet when Abby Abernathy (a.k.a. &#34;Pigeon&#34;) showed up unexpectedly at one of his underground college fights. I found it ironic Travis is a straight-A student.... almost too weird for the storyline, but I digress. After losing a bet, Abby must live with Travis for a month, but she insists they are only friends. It was so blatantly obvious to everyone that they were not just friends, except for Abby. It was just weird how much back and forth was in this book between them finally getting together, than breaking apart mostly on principal. It took a LONG time to get back together, which just frustrated the hell out of me!
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|This version, with updated animations, is even better than the first!  More difficult, more precision, and a whole lot funnier.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good game for wasting time and can be addicting  recommended for 10 and up works good for me on the kindle
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is fun, has good animation and I really like that you don't need to buy money for the game to advance but the breeding of the dragons is specific and I needed to constantly refer to the Wikia to determine what dragons to breed to get the dragon I wanted, and then I had to try multiple times until I happened to get the right one. At least you can keep the eggs of the dragons you don't hatch and use them for decoration and then if you get too many you can sell them. I really wish you could use game coins to buy gems,even if they cost an exorbitant amount. Getting coins isn't a problem but you really need gems to get the advanced stuff.
B002E2M3KM|5.0|I heard some really stupid complaints on Amazon about this record, about some people complaining that this vinyl has some 'bad master' that is 'inferior'. Its not. This is just people whining that its not version #1. What you have here is the original vinyl put on 180 gram Vinyl which allows for SUPERIOR sound and DURABILITY. You aren't getting anything digital or anything, all that you're getting is the original masters without much clicks or pops due to the 180 gram vinyl.

B0014KFV6I|5.0|Carole King is one of my favorite singers. Tapestry has songs that are still here with us and has never and will never grow old.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'll let the other glowing reviews speak for themselves. I felt this book provided an excellent story from start to end. The only frustration I felt was when the story cut between the two to three simultaneous story lines interrupting some fairly climactic events. However in retrospect it was done quite well, sparing the audience from having to read what they knew was sadly inevitable in several cases. Also don't think the book is all sunshine and roses, it's a dystopian tale for the most part with people dying that you don't want to. However, the conclusion is quite satisfying and fits excellently with the next book (Shift).<br /><br />I noticed one review that lamented the author's overly obvious and wordy style. Maybe it was there but it wasn't something I noticed or detracted in any way from the story. You can always read the first book (for free) if you are concerned...but beware, although the first book stands on it's own as a short story but since I knew the rest of the omnibus was available via a mere click away, I had to buy it immediately.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|The movie is fantastic by the way. To rent the video was a very easy transaction. Also the picture quality is fantastic.  I would def. rent a video from Amazon again!

B00E9ZATJO|5.0|I just watched \\"Monsters University\\" and it is an amazing prequel to Disney Pixar's classic \\"Monster Inc.\\" \\"Monsters University\\" is the back-story of how Sully and Mike Wazowski became the best friends they were in \\"Monsters Inc.\\" It all starts in college, from day one Mike has been a perfect student ever since he decided he wanted to be a top scarer when he grows up. That is his dream and he works hard to accomplish it. Sully, on the other hand thinks everything is going to be handed to him because he's a Sullivan and his father is the ultimate top scarer. Everything changes when both of them get kicked out of the scare program. This is when Mike and Sully must work together to prove they can be worthy of scaring. There's a surprise plot twist at the end that you'd have to watch to see what happens.<br /><br />I like the concept of \\"Monsters University\\" just as the original \\"Monsters Inc.\\" touched the hearts of many in 2001.  However, no one really knew how they became best friends in the beginning. This is what makes the concept of this movie so interesting because of the fact that normally you would see the movie of how they met first and then see them continue their life in a sequel. I also like the animation in this movie. Every character has their own personality and special features as none of the monsters look exactly the same.  Some have tentacles, some have more than two eyes and some monsters are scarier than others, but everyone has something in common: they all want to be a scarer.<br /> All the characters are very amazing but my favorite character is Mike Wazowski. When Mike was little, everyone always made fun of him for being too small and no one thought he would accomplish anything in life. He works hard to get into Monsters University because he is determined to succeed and in the end, he may not get what he wants but he is still happy, and that's what is important.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Mike and Sully are in the first round of the scare games and they have to race through a dark tunnel with spiky balls on the floor that make you blow up like a marshmallow. Both of them come out of the race with a puffy lip and swollen legs because they touched the spiky balls and they could barely talk. It made me laugh a lot.<br /><br />I recommend \\"Monsters University\\" for ages 6-14. It is an amazing family movie and kids will love it. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jailene A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

B00CHVJODE|5.0|Eep (Emma Stone) and her family are the classic cave people. They grunt when they get mad, they have never seen fire, and they hunt with their bare hands. They are stuck in a cave by their family leader, Husband and Father, Grug, (Nicolas Cage). The reason Grug is having his family stay in the cave is to keep them safe and away from harm. One night Eep, the oldest daughter, lets curiosity get the best of her and finds out that the earth is starting to end and they have to find higher ground to survive. Will they accept the challenge or will they keep hiding in their cave.<br /><br />I really like this film. It's very funny and keeps me laughing at the different situations and scenes. I feel a wide range of emotions as I go from hysterically laughing to a little crying. I absolutely love the 3D animation. It's vivid in colors with the scenes of the landscape, nature and animals in great depth. This is such a fantastic plot and I really like the characters. My favorite character is Eep because she is very brave, curious and just wants a real life. My favorite scene is when Eep is introducing herself and her family from her point of view. I like how she is telling the viewers how life is like for them.<br /><br />\\"The Croods\\" is rated PG with Kirk De Micco (Space Chimps) and Chris Sanders (How to Train your Dragon) directing it. It also stars the voice talents of Ryan Reynolds (Guy), Catherine Keener (Ugga), Cloris Leachman (Gran) and Clark Duke (Thunk). This is DreamWorks 1st animated film about a family going trough and dealing with changes.<br /><br />A big message in this film is that change is not always a bad thing. In addition, it's always good to listen to your parents because they know what's best for you.<br /><br />I recommend \\"The Croods\\" for ages 6 to 15 but adults will also enjoy it too.<br /><br />I give this film 5 out of 5 stars. It has great detail in the animation and makes me laugh a lot.<br /><br />Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Brianna Hope B. For more reviews by our youth critics go to kidsfirst.org.B.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think its a good cool game I think its an aproprate game for kids its fun and its realalistic
B005LAIIGW|5.0|A movie with such a title that is about the scary and dark void called \\"space,\\" you'd expect to be thrilling. Well, I have to tell you this movie is beyond thrilling. This film is a perfect combination of \\"Matrix\\" and \\"Inception\\" and will pump your adrenaline to a maximum level! \\"Gravity\\" is a life time experience that everyone must see! If you add to the mix that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney star in it as main characters, it just doesn't get better than that!<br /><br />Since this movie has so many genres, it's hard to tell its main one. This movie has adventure, comedy, sorrow, suspense, thrilling scenes, intense scary scenes and so much more! The main one out of all these fantastic genres is definitely suspense. You walk in feeling bored and tired and you walk out feeling like Ryan Stone in the movie. (Sandra Bullock)<br /><br />The thrilling adventure begins when a young medical engineer named Ryan Stone goes up in space to help with installations for the Hubble Telescope. It seems like a casual spacewalk, but when she gets stranded away from her ship, \\"Explorer,\\" she needs to get back to Earth by hitching a ride on a different station. If you want to find out how and if she and her co-worker,  Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) make it back to Earth alive, you have to watch the film.<br />The movie has so much adventure and so many impressive and clear graphics, it's hard not to like it! You feel like you are right there, experiencing whatever the main characters experience. The acting is amazing and there is deep meaning behind it - what would you do, if you were alone in the deepest and darkest part of this entire universe, with nobody but yourself? What would your thoughts be? Would you be able to remain hopeful or just give up and let Space take you? The camera work is the best I've ever seen. Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, I give you standing ovation for directing this masterpiece.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Ryan is stuck in a damaged escape pod with no fuel. She thinks she's stranded. Before she decides to give up and loose hope of returning to Earth, she starts to see Matt. Matt gets in when she does not have her helmet on and shows her that she can get back. As soon as his statement is over, he's gone. She hallucinated him but the plan worked!  It's a very interesting and important scene in the movie and that's why I like it.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG-13 and I honestly think it is appropriate for age 12 to 18. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and it is showing in theaters everywhere right now. I may be wrong, but I predict Oscar nominations for the cast and director of \\"Gravity.\\" Let's see what happens in 2014!<br /><br />Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Gerry O.

B008602KQI|4.0|Not unexpectedly, the movie was not true to the book and the book was far better on many fronts; particularly character development and story development. All that said, i enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to a friend.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|This newspaper app works flawlessly on Kindle. It's ten times better than the huffpost app for Kindle.  Photos/slideshows are so easy to view.  Huffpost, take note.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Yes you can see it on Netflix, but this DVD is well worth its money. The streaming version edits out so many parts that sometimes I got confused as to what's really going on (although you do get the big picture). The DVD also contains deleted scenes and I found the expanded proposal scene especially helpful when it comes to explaining this \\"color of the fruit\\" reference and why Margaret felt offended by his proposal.<br /><br />I will not rave about the actual story line, acting, production quality etc because so many reviewers have already talked about them in detail. In short this is a wonderful period drama and I would highly recommend owning this DVD.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I enjoyed this story very much.<br /> I preferred the first half but overall it held my attention throughout.<br />Good character development and most likely a realistic ending.<br />Worth reading and would recommend.

B00BGIC3T6|1.0|Silly, sophomoric, one line joke only someone going on 14 rather than 40 would enjoy. Focus on sexual organs, flatulence, and casual discussions about boners among people who barely know each other. Waste of time, the money Ivan replace.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this show. A few friends recommended it to me and after watching just the first show, I am hooked. Watch one every night and sometimes, when I have time, more than one. Really great!
B008Y212PI|4.0|My daughter and I both have been enjoying this FAOTD. My only suggestion would be to separate the paint brush and hammer as I have hit both mistakenly for the other.
B00AG475K8|5.0|I've liked this movie for 20 years or more (forget when I first saw it).  Everything about it draws me into the story of characters who interest and entertain me.  In high school I devoted a lot of time to art, didn't fit into the social scene, and had a wide variety of friends but certainly wasn't in with the in crowd.  The script is a terrific romantic comedy.  Keith, the main character, pulling all his college money out of the bank to buy some diamond ear rings for the hot looking girl he doesn't really know but is strongly attracted to on his one and only big date night doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but sounds like high school logic.  Whatever... the absorbing story is loaded with a wide variety of interesting characters, all of whom interested me, and I could relate to the high school angst many of these people were going through.  The humor keeps it upbeat.  Great script writing, acting, direction, music, editing, et. al.

0385351399|4.0|This is a little close to home for me since my daughter works for a social media mega company but I did think Dave Eggers spin on what social media could do to/for the world is interesting and a bit of a scary read. Mae starts her career after college with the help from a friend, Annie who is going places at a Silicon Valley mega social media corporation. The Circle seems harmless enough and has some really great perks - ice cream, state of the art workout facilities, fine dining and living quarters. Soon she finds herself surrounded by events she is \\"required\\" to attend and post online to bump her ratings in the Circle community. \\"Sharing is Caring\\" is one of the company's mottoes and as Mae soon discovers, her popularity and place in the company is slipping due to her perceived lack of interest in sharing every aspect of her day with the world. The Circle begins new programs to track and pry into every part of the world's life and soon some around her begin to rebel. Her family and old friends will have trouble dealing with this obsession Mae has with her job. There is also a mystery man who could turn out to be the best thing for her or get her fired. All is not what it seems within the company. Is it the beginning of a perfect world for all or will it be closer to George Orwell's \\"1984\\". \\"The Circle\\" will be enjoyed (or feared) by those just about to enter the job market, already in up to their neck or those that fear social media in general. As I turn to hit the button that will send this review to various social media, I am already thinking differently about all my smart devices and behavior.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Damn fine book! Although The Shining was a very scary story, I really enjoyed this one. like a lot of people, I too wondered what happened to little Danny. I loved the way Abra was incorporated into the story. I think it added that perfect touch.<br />I would definitely encourage SK fans, even those who think that he lost it with Under The Dome,  to read this, totally worth it!
B00005JKDR|5.0|I thought this movie might scare my 4 year old, so I was ready with the remote when we watched it the first time.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Really enjoying it and i love being able to read it on my iphone with the kindle app. Loving the series!
B003YAR97K|4.0|To me it was worth it i just wanted all 3 movies but all 3 DVD's are stacked on top of each other in the case. Not really a big deal to me because I'm pretty careful with DVDs and CDs. If you are worried about the getting scratched from being stacked you might want extra DVD cases or to just buy all three separate.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Stuff blows up, plenty of cool action, not a lot of silly talking to mess things up. Good times. They didn't make the psychic thing (which was pretty stupid looking back) overly stupid, just a nice device to keep the plot moving along.
B004V9MU86|5.0|Felt like I learned a lot about the 2nd world war and also about death as the book is narrated by death!

B009EHDU7U|3.0|The beginning of this book annoyed me, the constant repetition of the young man with greasy hair in a leather jacket, blah, blah, blah put me off.

For me though, it was just a European Forrest Gump, that lacked the charm that movie had on first viewing.
B00EBJ624O|5.0|It makes perfect sense to create a musical partnership between Yuja Wang and Gustavo Dudamel, both superstars with DG contracts.  With the added influence of the Simon Bolivar Orchestra of Venezuela, there's a great feeling of freshness and youthful spontaneity.  For all the thrill of excitement that these young musicians bring, some will worry that they'll show signs of inexperience.  Despite flashy careers and great popularity, some critics charge them of shallowness, and lack of intrinsic musicality.  Is there good cause for premonition?<br /><br />Starting off with the Rachmaninov 3rd Concerto, long a virtuoso display piece, we hear musicianship that is well-considered and very mature.  Rachmaninov readings of late have tended to shy away from gooey sentimentality in favor of more refinement and modernist sensibility.  Here the first two movements could almost be seen as dry-eyed, yet they move with flexibility and true involvement.  Every phrase sounds natural and there's dramatic undercurrent that lends a feeling of expectation.  Wang has an inspiring technique, so she tackles every challenge with no sign of stress.  But she doesn't simply run through the music either; she has commanding control and one feels she gives everything she has.  She chooses the shorter, easier cadenza in the first movement, something some listeners will bewail, but it's a minor cavil either way.  In the finale we get to hear actual fireworks for the first time, with both Wang and Dudamel letting go with frenzied abandon.  I can't imagine anyone listening without being captivated by the sheer charisma of these musicians--it's quite an experience.<br /><br />If anything the Prokofiev 2nd Concerto is better and there's comparatively little competition.  With its percussive, modernist idiom, it hardly hurts when interpreters take it with towering precision and unbounded energy.  It's a thrilling display of pyrotechnics here.  Nothing sounds brusque though, and it's a good thing that Wang can be biting and sarcastic without banging out the notes.  There's freedom in the phrasing actually, which makes the piece playful without wearing on the listener's ear.  Dudamel is vivacious and makes the most out of the rip-roaring orchestral part--the orchestra plays with surprising accuracy.  In all, the force of two fiery young musicians makes this concerto a romp from beginning to end.<br /><br />There's a chance this recording will be a divider, since there's a unique combination of refinement and dynamic involvement that some will find self-conscious.  I can only argue that charisma wins out in the end.g can be biting and sarcastic without banging out the notes.

B008FQ1O1K|3.0|The 5 People You Meet in Heaven is one of the best books I've read. Sweet, interesting while certainly a moralistic tale. I hated the contrived Tuesdays with Morrie because it didn't feel genuine. This sits somewhere in the middle. It still has those same Christian and morality tones but some of the characters are likable enough that you go along with it.<br />I don't know who I'd recommend this to. I did feel an emotional connection with some of the characters while reading the book, but in some ways it's a fairly forgettable tale as soon as you finish.

B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|Whedon, who put this together, put together the bang up job on the Avengers, also put together Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series.<br /><br />With Buffy, love the series, but the first season or so was ... meh (okay) ... It was all about the later seasons, where the actors and plot hit it's stride.<br /><br />I'm getting a similar vibe here.  Decent actors for the most part, accents on some of the actors gets annoying.  For whatever reason it seems that accents are obligatory now, not a believer in that.  Put a good actor in, have them read the lines straight up.<br /><br />Their banter isn't up to snuff yet, the inter-relationships a bit predictable, everyone and I mean everyone has at least one major secret banging on the door, trying to get out of the closet.<br /><br />Secrets just seem too.... well, densely packed...  They should have handed out SHIELD scorecards.<br /><br />Still it has it's moments, the set devices (particularly the &#34;bus&#34;) are quite nice.<br /><br />Actors good, characters at this point seem a bit one dimensional, the James Bond type guy stoic, can do it all by myself, don't need anyone else.  His saving grace, he has decent martial arts skills and the fight scenes are generally pretty good.<br /><br />The &#34;rebel&#34;, well, decent eye candy, but very annoying at present, if she had a flag, she'd be waving it all the time.<br /><br />The seasoned spy who doesn't want combat and winds up piloting the &#34;bus&#34;, love that actress, but right now playing an extremely subdued personality type.  Not really using her to effect, but I think that will change.<br /><br />Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-dum, the &#34;Bobsie&#34; (Sp?) twins, beyond annoying... need to come up with a new word for that...  predictable... pendantic... dunno, let me get back on that.<br /><br />Coulson, hero from the Avengers &#34;OH he must never know his secret&#34;, like how he &#34;survived&#34; the Avengers movie after being harpooned and *chuckle* sent to Tahiti?!?<br /><br />Plots....  well, they push the limits sometimes, Can't say a lot here without spoiling the plot for those that haven't seen it yet.<br /><br />I have some faith in Whedon, think it will get better, but also though I've pulled the plug on my TV, I've found a legal source for the episodes where I don't have to pay for them (See Playon, the software product), and doubtless it's available directly off the web site.<br /><br />So, likely will continue to watch, but not continue to pay for this, at this rate a few days / week delay for watching this is fine for me.ti?!?<br /><br />Plots....  well, they push the limits sometimes, Can't say a lot here without spoiling the plot for those that haven't seen it yet.<br /><br />I have some faith in Whedon, think it will get better, but also though I've pulled the plug on my TV, I've found a legal source for the episodes where I don't have to pay for them (See Playon, the software product), and doubtless it's available directly off the web site.<br /><br />So, likely will continue to watch, but not continue to pay for this, at this rate a few days / week delay for watching this is fine for me.

However it will be a struggle.  However kind readers if you like this brutal & convoluted type of writing do not be discouraged by my review & enjoy this Pulitzer book.
B008469DGY|4.0|This is an entertaining game.  It is very addicting and I can see myself playing this for hours while other games do not normally hold my interest for very long.  I thought it was easy to play as well.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book will make you stop and think. Another great, simple novel by Albom.<br />Fast read but will touch your heart.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|I thought the game was cute, when I tried playing it after the install.  But, I wanted to quit the game and I could not get it to quit.  Options only started the game over for me.  The only way to stop it was to power off my phone.  So, I ended up uninstalling it.
B00F91G5BS|3.0|As a fan of The Walking Dead, I had to give this movie a shot. The way people were &#34;zombified&#34; had a different spin, which was pretty interesting, and I also thought the pace of the movie was good. There isn't a lot of lag time in getting right into the meat of the story, and I appreciated that. It was worth the rental, and I would watch it again.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As usual, Mr. King brings us an excellent story. I give it five out of five stars, worth your time to check out.
159562015X|1.0|I bought this book brand new from Amazon. I made sure that I was getting a brand new book because I needed the access code in order to take the assessment for a college class. I just unsealed the access code and tried to enter it on the Strengths Finder website. I was told multiple times that the code is invalid or already in use. I guess I should have known better than to buy this book on Amazon rather than my school's bookstore. I would have spent a little more money in the bookstore but at least I would have had a code that works.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|My husband and I watched the entire season with our 20 year old daughter.  We watched all of the episodes back to back over two days.  It was like reading a book we couldn't put down.<br /><br />We have turned to many BBCA shows in search of better programs, with more originality, than what is currently coming out of Hollywood, both in network shows and movies.  All three of us loved 'Orphan Black' and have been discussing it for the last 3 days, still trying to figure out what is going to happen next, who is really who, who are the 'bad guys' and what is the motivation.  It keeps you engaged.  There are some very funny lines and situations.  Great, well written, smart, funny, surprising, engaging, thought provoking, and sometimes disturbing show.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />The main actress, Tatiana Maslany, who plays multiple roles in this show, is amazing.<br /><br />Daughter looked it up, we'll have to keep discussing it till April 2014 when the next season starts.  Looking forward to it!

0674057929|4.0|My first one had wavy pages at the top for about the first 40 or so pages.  It was like it had been exposed to a little humidity.  It wasn't a complete deal breaker but for a brand new book published so recently it should've been perfect.  There was also a black marker line of about an inch along the paper edge.  I exchanged it with no hassle.  The new one has some waviness as before but not nearly as bad.  I've kept it underneath some heavier books and it appears to be flattening out.  I really think it will over time.  The waviness isn't all that bad but my favorite author is Wilde so I was extra picky wanting it to be absolutely perfect.  It's possible all have a little wave but I really have no idea.  The first one's paper cover was very loose but the second one was tight and doesn't slip.  I'm glad and satisfied enough with my purchase.
B00DZAWPNM|5.0|Got it from Target because I couldn't wait for it to ship.  It's amazing.  I saw them in concert last month and they were brilliant.  This Album will not let you down.  It's just beautiful.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is very touching. It is great for people at any age who are going through a rough time or even people who just want to see a different perspective on life. It has a beautiful message that I believe needs to heard.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|A magical look back at a place and time that relatively few Americans know much about . . . except for the classic music that came out of the Muscle Shoals area beginning in the 1960's.  The cinematography, story lines, and personal interviews were shot in a way that weaved a wonderful tapestry and gave a testament to the power of a sound that  literally grabbed the world's attention. All of this from the backwater shores of a small Alabama town on the Tennessee River. Do yourself a favor and watch this tale of hardship, determination, extreme competition, and, of course, some awesome music.  A story of Rick Hall, the Swampers and the \\"Lady in the Lake.\\"

1936891026|5.0|This book is creative nutrition it literally gives anyone with a creative mind EVERYTHING you need to survive without anything unnecessary. It is fruits and vegetables to the soul and it has changed the direction and the intensity in which I write, the quote that I tell myself everyday to assist in fighting RESISTANCE: \\"The Principle of Priority states (A) you must know the difference between what is urgent and what is important, and (B) you must do what's important first.\\"

TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!! WELL DONE, AEROSMITH!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how well this streamed movies from Google Play, but it's not as good from a browser unless you have a fast network and a fast laptop. Watching a movie from the browser on my Chromebook wasn't possible, too slow and jerky. I thought this would be a good way to connect my Chromebook to hotel televisions, but it's first necessary to register the device on the hotel network which can be difficult to impossible. It would be nice if there could be a direct WiFi link from a notebook to the device.
1593275080|5.0|The rising popularity of LEGO as an art form is emphatically punctuated in Mike Doyle's book, Beautiful LEGO. Whereas the title seems to obviously declare what's inside, once you crack the pages and take a look, you'll wonder how Doyle kept his title so simple.  This book is spectacular and should be more adequately titled, \\"267 pages of stunning, crisp, high resolution, full color photos of LEGO creations that will blow you away.\\"  Even the back cover and fold-over dust jacket are packed with artfully arranged high res. images, rather than busy words.  This book is definitely destined to become the de rigueur of coffee table LEGO books [and may shove a few modern art books out of the way as well.]<br /><br />Beautiful LEGO takes you on a jaw-dropping photo journey of the creations of around 70 different LEGO artists from around the world, including brief interviews with about a dozen of them.  The LEGO creations depicted in the book range in size from Doyle's 200,000 piece, Contact-- the fantasy city featured on the cover-- down to 10 piece birds and snails with amazing character.  Unlike other LEGO books where the photography and resolution are secondary, every image in this book appears to consist of a well-lit, clutter-free, high res. images destined for the Smithsonian.  Many images are so clear you can see the airtight seams between even the smallest of bricks.<br /><br />Among the strengths of this book is that Doyle does not linger on any particular LEGO artist, building style or motif for more than a few pages.  The upside to this is that the reader gets a wide-ranging view of the amazing capabilities of the artist and their bricks, but the downside is that you may crave more.  Although the outcome is positive, the images flow like a mad-mans brainstorm (which is some of the appeal of this book).  You never know what you will see next.  Creations include space stations, fish, steampunk-style attic treasures, birds, cars, dragons, dissected frogs, fast food,cartoon characters,  modern homes...you name it.<br /><br />It should be clarified that this book is not a building instruction book, nor a how-to book. It does overflow, however, with creativity and beauty that will prove inspiring beyond any other LEGO book to date. Observant LEGO fans will certainly be able to create some of the smaller works should they desire, but most of the works are placed in this book to enjoy.
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|This is a really good game, no silly hidden objects, just good graphics and challenging but solveable puzzles.  It felt too short but that may be because I was having fun.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Completely awesome app on my Samsung S4.  Very easy to use.  I love the ability to compare 5 different translations with a tap to the scripture number.  Really helps to identify the clarity of the New World Translation.  I also love the maps, glossary and other appendix items.  The Bible questions in the front are great for those just starting to study the Bible or as a quick reminder where to find a scripture to everyday subjects. Now I need the Kindle version.  Can't wait!!!!
B00E6Z0THE|3.0|I am starting over because I must have missed some things as I hit a dead end.  The graphics are good, but it is a bit repetitive.
B005779X4U|5.0|Didn't tell the SO how much we paid for it until it was unwrapped and set up. We LOVE this thing, and the price tag became a non-issue once it was in action. It's spendy, but with a 10 year warranty and completely solid and smart construction, it's entirely worth it.<br /><br />We replaced an old plastic trashcan with this, and it works perfectly for our needs. We love the fact that there's a separate compartment for the recycling, and the liners are great. We're seriously considering purchasing the SimpleHuman liners in bulk. It's incredibly easy to keep clean, it looks great, and it can bear the weight of our dopey 15lb cat without denting (nice bonus, but we discourage his jumping on it as much as we can).<br /><br />We haven't had any issues with the lid banging against the wall (another reviewer mentioned) unless we're particularly forceful in stepping down. It doesn't require a lot of pressure to open, so we haven't had any problems.<br /><br />The trashcan itself is huge (in a good way) - it doesn't look as big in the pictures which made me nervous until I grabbed the measuring tape. It won't hold as much trash as a conventional trashcan might, but we really don't need to hoard our trash that long either, so taking it out when it's full works and helps us avoid old trash stink in the kitchen.<br /><br />That being said, with the lid and the construction of the trash can, smelly stuff doesn't really escape unless the lid is open. All in all, we love it and we'd buy it again if we had to (but shouldn't need to for at least 10 years).

B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Entertaining with some very funny moments thrown in. My kids, 7 & 8 yrs old, really liked it. Worth renting.
B00AEBBA72|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.<br />Johnny Depp and Tim Burton at their best.<br />a great story with unforgettable characters and a great twist to the old story that gives an amazing backstory to the origin of the headless horseman.<br />well worth the money.

B00AJLHULW|3.0|Robben's recent effort is a very laid back affair with no real burners so to speak. Some nice grooves, but the material choice is very pedestrian blues with one exception, a self-penned ballad, &#34;Oh, Virginia&#34; one of the real standouts of the recording. His playing is stellar but nothing grabs me other than the aforementioned tune and &#34;Fools Paradise&#34;.
B00003CWN3|5.0|I love Hilary Swank and I love her movies.<br />this one made me cry a bit at the end but it's still a beautiful story.<br />well worth a watch.

B0007PLLQ0|5.0|a wonderful classic from my childhood.<br />used to love it when I was a kid.<br />though it's a bit different from what I remember it's still a classic and worth the money.<br />I still love it even today.
031623480X|4.0|Makes sense. More veggies, fewer carbs ( sigh ) and more quality protein. I gave up wheat a while back and feel better. Gluten avoidance came next. This book puts the whole grain debate into perspective.
0553384775|2.0|Let's face it.  One of the best reasons to read is to live vicariously through others.  Therefore, I have no problem with sex, drugs, midget throwing, etc.  I also have friends who are NY brokers and involved in investment banking.  Therefore,  I was quite interested in learning about how they lived in the late 80's and early 90's  as I was a poor grad student they were throwing around big cash. For the first two chapters this book captures that essence and then it falls off a horrible cliff.<br /><br />By the end of it, you dislike all of the people involved and realize the protagonist has learned nothing.  He's still a conman with a Napoleon complex who is apparently fascinated with loamy loins.  I couldn't help but think that the entire last 2/3 of the book was like a giant, sloppy, apology letter to the \\"Duchess\\" in a feeble attempt to get her back.  So if you enjoy reading sloppy, break-up drivel  then you may really like this book.  I will also be happy to send you the love poetry I wrote in the 8th grade to add to your collection.<br /><br />All in all, this book is not about Wall Street, sex, drugs, redemption, the SEC or anything remotely interesting.  Instead it is about a self-absorbed man who has not come to terms with himself and has the emotional maturity of a fraternity pledge.
B00936A0RU|5.0|My new all-time FAVOURITE movie,have even watched it back to back.Also a true story,so it makes it even more enticing.Enjoy!

B000NY12LO|5.0|In this book which treats the topic of bullying the author raises many questions that deserve to be considered even though they may be unanswerable.  The parents of the child who was bullied ask what they did wrong; the friend (the ONLY friend of the bullied child) asks this question.  Her shocking answer becomes evident with the surprise ending.<br /><br />Picoult doesn't offer any easy answers but she does ask the questions that we all may ask ourselves regarding the issue of bullying.  We are all responsible.

B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I can't think of any words powerful enough to adequately express how much I loved Fangirl, but I'm going to spend the rest of this review trying to find them.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell's second young adult novel follows reticent Cath through her freshman year of college as she copes with social anxiety, a suddenly distant twin sister, balancing her fanfiction writing career with her Fiction Writing class, boys who smile too much, and boys who lie too much.  There's more too - child abandonment, mental instability, alcohol abuse, romance.  It comes together to form one of the best contemporary novels I've ever read.  Seriously.  It's up there with my favorite of favorites, Anna and the French Kiss.  Possibly higher.<br /><br />I think this is primarily because of how natural everything felt.  Even the heavier topics I mentioned above manage to fit organically into the plot without ever overtaking the story. It's not a novel about alcohol abuse or family problems or anxiety.  It's about Cath.  All those issues just happen to be part of her life.<br /><br />That naturalness applies to the characters as well.  No matter how sparsely or frequently they appear, every single one of them seems just as real as anyone I've met during my own first year of college; as if (to use a phrase from the book) they were about to \\"evolve right off the page.\\"  That goes for everyone from Cath's twin sister Wren, to her snarky roommate Reagan, to Levi the ever-friendly Starbucks employee who always seems to be hanging around their room.<br /><br />The relationships between all these characters, too, were gorgeously built.  They grew slowly and honestly.  No snap friendships or instant romance to be found here.  Everything took time (sometimes, given Cath's trust issues, quite a bit of time).<br /><br />This is usually where I might add in a however or but; where I might comment on something that bugged me or didn't exactly work.  Hard as I search my mind, though, I can't think of one negative thing to say about Fangirl.  Not one.<br /><br />So, instead, I'll talk about something that could have gone badly, but didn't.  Really, really didn't.<br /><br />Much of the story centers around a made-up, Harry Potter-esque book series that Cath has not only adored since childhood, but for which she's spent the last two years penning a novel-length fanfiction.  I was skeptical at first of how Rowell would handle the fact that her main character was devoting a good chunk of her thoughts to books and characters with whom her readers would be unfamiliar.<br /><br />It wasn't a problem.  Namely, because she made sure readers would be familiar with the Simon Snow world-within-a-world she'd created.  Throughout the novel, Rowell separates sections with excerpts from both the Simon Snow books themselves and Cath's Simon Snow fanfiction.  This too somehow seemed perfectly natural and necessary; partly because these segments often had something to do with what was happening in Cath's life, and partly because they provided proof of Cath's passion for writing.  Rowell doesn't simply say that her main character is a writer.  She shows her to be one.  And, just as importantly, Rowell gives her readers the opportunity to care about Simon Snow, and so to understand why Cath does.  (For the record, I miss Simon and Baz right now just as much as I do Cath and Levi.)<br /><br />On that note, I happen to be a mild (by which I mean obsessed) fanfiction addict, but I hope I haven't given the impression that you have to be a fangirl yourself to enjoy this book.  You don't.  Fandom culture is certainly an element of the story, but, like the alcohol and abandonment plot lines,  it never overpowers the narrative.<br /><br />I'm still not sure I managed to express how much I enjoyed this book, but I'll leave at this: Read Fangirl.  It's well written, quirky, deep, and definitely worth both the time and bookshelf space.
B008UX2UIO|5.0|As I planned my next trip to New Orleans, I read in Fodor's guide to the city that this book is indispensible reading. So it is.<br />It's very easy to see, right from the beginning, how the late John Kennedy Toole was able to capture the essence of the city better than any other fiction author, before or since.<br />The story itself is a delight to follow, with incredibly colorful characters always interacting with each other in amusing and often unexpected ways. And the city comes alive as they do, in its festive and dangerous neighborhoods.<br />By the way, if you're interested in New Orleans, you'll find the best non-fiction about it - as well as the most complete review of 'A Confederacy of Dunces' - in Andrei Codrescu's 'New Orleans, Mon Amour'.
0385349831|5.0|His works and words have been invaluable to me. I recommend his books to every person I come across who is on a certain frequency.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|I didn’t get the chance to see this movie while it was in the theaters, but was looking forward to catching it on DVD.  I had heard a lot of buzz about how good it was and how many awards it was up for and I like Jennifer and Bradley a lot in things I have seen them in so far.  I did enjoy the movie but it didn’t meet my expectations I had built it up to be and that was my fault mainly.  The story about two dysfunctional people trying to make a functioning relationship work was funny and sad at the same time, but after watching this and thinking about most of the relationships I know of, dysfunctional isn’t too far off from some of the best.  I’d watch it again if someone I knew had not and wanted to, but not sure I would watch it solo again.
B0081J9OWC|5.0|I just recently in the last few weeks have discovered Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros. They are one of those bands that when you hear their music you want to go out and buy every album they've ever made. Such wonderful music, listening to it takes me back to a different time and place.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Quinton made a comment when he won an Oscar for his Original Screenplay that went something like “I found awesome people to show you an awesome story” and I would have to agree.  It was a fun story from a vengeance and violence standpoint that showed some of my favorite actors doing outrageous things.  Like many of Quentin’s stories it isn’t the blood and gore that brings you to the theater, it is the interchange between the characters before/after they have pulled the trigger.  The conversations between the explosions, gun shots, whipping and outlandish plans ring true and make you that much more excited for the scenes where bullets fly.  If you have enjoyed his work in the past you will find this a good addition to your movie collection.  (If you haven’t seen his other stuff, do.)
B00AE4OGCU|3.0|Yes again worth the price, let 's face it you are getting the whole story in one go.  Having seen the film on the first book, it was nice to take my time in establishing what Actually was going on and it does need a bit of thought.  But all-in-all enjoyable.
B0057EYACI|5.0|I have several CDs, but they didn't complete my collection.  This CD did finish off the songs I was missing.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This is a great series and I have the other seasons on DVD. I'm glad I bought this season too. Watched it in 2 days.
B00006LPER|2.0|The two stars were for the acting, and all other components except the content.  Not sure why anyone would like to watch such sick and disturbing movie, to prove what? We all know that  there are mean, twisted, sick, controlling individuals? Unless yo are a sucker for being disturbed and a bit ill, don't watch it, there are better ways to spend your time.
1442485388|4.0|The book was somewhat like the movie but I enjoyed it because of the increased depth of characters. It's different from the movie but I sort of expected that. The differences were substantial for Simon's fate but I guess that's workable depending on if they keep making movies about this series. Since the movie's box office appears less than the cost of the movie, I suspect we'll only see one movie on the series. I liked the movie and hope there are more.
1400067820|5.0|This book has a lot to offer to anyone curious about how our world works at a systemic level (economy/finance), with important corollaries for both personal and group attitudes and ethics.<br />The author puts his money where is mouth his - both metaphorically and literally, and this is extraordinarily rare in the age of punditry and posturing from academia to wall street to the media.<br /><br />He's well-educated and very smart. Get over Taleb's personality and read this book - the arrogant style is a small price to pay, and if you go with it, it's actually quite amusing.
1416972242|4.0|I liked the book and it's a good followup to the first book in the series. I bought the 3rd book at Barnes and Noble and I'm reading it now. I'll probably buy the 4th book from amazon.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I loved it. I'm a big kid so this was right up my alley. I'll watch it again soon. Can't wait for part 2 to reach Amazon.
B009LDD5E0|4.0|I have the other seasons and since the season tapes have the performances individually split out, I bought this one too. I haven't watched it yet but I'm watching the new season right now.
B002QS5OQ4|5.0|I admit the beginning of this season all they did was bitch about air..... but then it got really good  wish the would have finished off the series with a movie or book at lease

0618918248|5.0|I bought this book on kindle on amazon.co.uk so my buying it might not show on this site.<br /><br />This book has, I believe, attained the status of 'iconic' and a 'must-read'. It is well worthy of that status. It is an excellent widely-encompassing look at the falsity of so-called 'religion'. I write 'so-called' because what passes for religion seems to me to be vulgar blatant superstition.<br /><br />Dawkins looks at 'religion' from many viewpoints and he gives a good description of the various 'proofs' for religion that have been put forward by believers over the centuries. He despatches them all very easily, which is to be expected since each one contains at least one glaring fallacy. The two that are probably most influential today are the 'First Cause' and 'Pascal's Wager'. I think many people seem to fail to see that the 'First Cause' has a fallacy that literally jumps out at a reader. This is that if everything needs a cause for it to exist then why should God be any different. By the logic presented, God needs a cause. Also, as Dawkins point out, an intelligent designer would need to be more complex than his creation. So God's existence needs even more explanation than the universe does.<br /><br />Pascal's Wager is the idea that, since the pains of hell are so great and the reward of heaven so attractive, it makes sense to adopt religious belief 'just in case' it turns out to be true. The idea is insulting, of course, and of no merit as Dawkins points out. Actually, at time of writing, on YouTube there is an excellent short video on 'Pascal's Wager' by Jaclyn Glenn at<br />[...]<br /><br />There is much of interest in this book. I found the parts on 'cargo cults' and on 'memes' most interesting. There is also an extensive bibilography.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly.
B0025KVLUQ|4.0|Some very innovative stuff from the sixties. Liked it a lot, play it often and would recommend it to anyone who likes pop.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Like most ongoing games, this can be fascinating and addictive. The tutorial  lets you get started quickly, and you don't need to spend much literal cash to keep progressing. Energy points accumulate even when you are out of the game,so if you run out you can leave and come back. My only complaint (like another reviewer's) is that the time limit for HO scenes seems a little too short. Perhaps I'll get better with practice.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|After all the hype the book received I thought I would give it a go. I shortly found myself rushing home to open the book's pages again. The language was accessible and easy to read, although sometimes a little awkward on public transport. I often found myself laughing out loud at some of the predicaments that occur in the book.<br /><br />I did however get a little tired of Ana's inner goddess and her acrobatic flipping, skipping and cartwheeling every time Christian did.. pretty much anything. I would have preferred the inner goddess to take a nap and not wake up. It appears that inner goddess continues with her flipping tendencies in book two, which I ran out to buy as soon as I put down book one.
B000R3NNDQ|5.0|Great book!!! I planned on sharing with my local school system with our Winter Leadership Retreat in December. I currently serve as the Chairman of our Board of Education for Peach County School System in Fort Valley, Ga.

B006O6F932|5.0|Got this for grand daughter's 7th birthday at her bequest. I was impressed at the excellent price, better than the local big name discount stores I shopped (W & T). Ordering was painless, it arrived in great shape, well packaged, and very quickly as promised.<br />She was elated, and set about construction with her mom and sisters....they played all day and the next with all the lovely little doo dahs and I enjoyed watching.<br />Great gift, but there are a lot of tiny detailed pieces so a child should be mature enough to enjoy and &#34;take care&#34; of all of them<br />D

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Nothing much to say here. It's a fun game, with plenty to do.<br />I do wish so much of it didn't depend on real money. But the majority of our society has accepted such transactions.<br />My advice- limit yourself. Don't get upset over collections or missed bingos. Just have fun.
031623480X|5.0|I bought this book for parents in my pediatric practice because it starts a dialogue about healthy eating and the dangers of listening to mainstream dietary experts when it comes to grains. How we eat directly affects the quality of our life as we age and enjoy our children and grandchildren. More importantly, the diet an expectant mother consumes unequivocally contributes to her baby's mental and physical wellbeing. A dialogue about the effects of the foods we eat will help prevent depression, anxiety, diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ADHD, seizures and obesity in children, parents and grandparents. Gluten causes inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain and the rest of the body; additionally, it affects the development and maintenance of neurons. Science is clearly showing us that health is a combination of nutrient intake and lifestyle. This informative book aides me as a pediatrician help parents restore, maintain and promote a healthy family environment and prevent mental as well as physical ailments in the future. Devour this book for your mental health.
B002MJV7JA|5.0|Great DVD season I bought to watch since I didn't have E! When the 1st & 2nd seasons were showing on TV. Glad that I could catch up by watching the complete season DVD.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was great! I could not put it down. I kept wanting to know what was going to happen next. I absolutely loved it!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Well, I'm not used to write reviews about the books I like. But this one make me think that it owes one.<br />At first, I would like to say that I decided to buy this book after reading some of other reviews, and the few that was explained there directed me to buy it.<br />It was a rewarding experience to read this plot, to identify on it characters and situations that could really happen as a possibility.<br />I will not try to make a summary, others have done a very good job on it. What I can say is that this book worth its price and will give you back exciting reading hours.<br />Go ahead, you will not be disappointed.
B00FFVLYTU|5.0|I think mine will be something like the 462nd review so I wonder what I can say that hasn't already been said and done so in the most amazing ways.  Still, I will go ahead and add my stars to the tab this remarkable series is racking up.  I can't sleep and need something to do.<br /><br />From the opening of the first episode I was taken in the grip of this drama.  It had me by the throat and punched me in the gut.  I literally couldn't breathe in some parts.  Be warned, most of the time it is so painful to watch.  I cried.  I couldn't help it.  I got caught up in it.  As a parent, I had no problem whatsoever relating to the nightmare unfolding in the lives of the family of the murdered boy. Talk about intense! I started watching as soon as the first episode became available via Amazon's instant streaming but I actually didn't watch each episode as soon as it was downloaded because I didn't know if I could take any more!  But I did continue to watch.  I had to...a saga about each individual in the show was being revealed.  It became more than the effect this death had on the victim's family.  The impact and trauma expanded to every single person in the small community of Broadchurch.<br /><br />Don't expect any relief or distraction from the horror of the murder of a young boy.  It was sad without any let up.  The music was beautiful and haunting adding to and intensifying the melancholy.  There was no waking up from the nightmare and the sun coming up in the morning.  Which is exactly what I imagine it would be like to live through such a shattering event. There is no happy ending.  The final episode, 8, is a devastating reveal of the murderer and the added devastation it causes. Someone murdered this child in a small close-knit community.  Everyone in Broadchurch is thinking, &#34;It must have been a stranger that did this evil thing, right?&#34;  I kept thinking, could finding out that the murderer is someone known to this traumatized family make it even more painful? Perhaps. Still, the people of Broadchurch comforted themselves with the knowledge that no one they know could do such a horrific thing and as a beach front &#34;tourist&#34; town, the murderer has to be a stranger.  And then...suspicion begins to be cast about...upon locals...we have a front row seat to see what this does...who begins pointing fingers at whom.  No one is left untouched and unaffected by the fallout.  Broadchurch is ripped apart...and so was I.<br /><br />I loved the writing.  I liked the way the story was told/revealed bit by bit.  I appreciated that I wasn't &#34;let in&#34; on who the killer was or even what motivated the murder until the very end.  I got the impression that a philosophy was being put forth.  For me, the &#34;lesson&#34; was one of not jumping to conclusions, that appearances can definitely be deceiving; things aren't usually as straight forward as they first appear, are not black and white.  Another thing I enjoyed was how the writing gave us realistic and believable characters doing and saying things that fit their situation.  Yes, at first glance we are only given enough information to tempt us to jump to conclusions but ultimately things made sense.  Peoples' actions and behavior always has a why behind them and the writing did a good job of realistically portraying the why...when it's revealed, that is.  You know, someone says something and we wonder, &#34;Why&#34; did they say that?  A lot of the time the dialogue in both film and books, for me, is hugely disconnected between what is said and why a person would possibly say it.  Would they really say that?  It really bugs me when this disconnect happens and Broadchurch had very little of it.<br /><br />I liked having to unravel the layers of the folks of Broadchurch, myself, rather than having it done for me.  I enjoyed how &#34;the why&#34; which motivated and shaped each person's behavior was revealed.  How and why did they get where they were in their lives?  Some sins do indeed have long shadows and they don't necessarily have to be our own sins.  So, how do people live through, get beyond, and even overcome events in their lives?  There are a lot of walking wounded.  And they abound in this program. Some programs are pure escapism, not this one. It's a drama, a tragedy. It is not a typical crime procedural (I believe that is the term.) I didn't think that this show was mainly about solving the murder.  It was mainly about how the murder effected the family and then in a ripple effect every other person in the community and further.<br /><br />I was transported from my sofa into the community of Broadchurch.  I became a neighbor and emotionally connected.  By developing the characters over several episodes there was a greater depth to everyone.<br /><br />I can't find fault with any of the acting. It was completely top-notch.  I am a huge fan of British programming and I am constantly awed by the degree of greatness in the acting!  These people are good.  They don't get their roles because they look good on camera in jeans without a T-shirt!  I've never followed the Dr. Who series so am not familiar with Tennant in that roll but I thought he was masterful.  He played a mournful and deeply scarred person to perfection.  He was driven in his pursuit of the truth.  I wanted to know what had happened to him that had shaped him. He was an outsider in Broadchurch. He was sent there to solve this murder yet, there was a connection and it was personal, that was made plain, but it wasn't a connection to the victim or anyone involved.  So, what was it?<br /><br />Now, on the other hand, Detective Ellie (Olivia Colman) was a local.  Her son was a close friend of the murdered boy.  Her family was closely connected to and lived just a few doors down from the victim.  Like everyone else in Broadchurch this was up-close-and-personal. She should have been in charge of the case but was blindsided by having Tennant assigned instead.  To add insult to injury she was forced to endure his rough and insensitive manner toward everyone she had known forever. The suspects were her friends and she began the investigation pretty much unable to even consider that someone she knows could have committed such an atrocity to one of their own. As the story unfolds she begins to see people once so familiar to her in different ways than she did before.  She discovers she didn't really know them at all.  Colman was brilliant.  The emotion she brought to the role was astounding.  She was completely believable and real to me.<br /><br />It would be a glaring omission not to mention how well all the other roles were acted.  The young murdered boy was painfully beautiful.  His parents portrayed the crippling and devastating blow of losing their son absolutely superbly. You'll see the supporting characters perform their parts perfectly.<br /><br />At the conclusion we are notified that &#34;Broadchurch will return.&#34;  For me, I will watch to see what the writer(s) will bring to the screen next.  I would like to see what happens to these folks.  Could I stand to see another 8 episodes of such heart wrenching melancholy? I'm really not sure.  This offering was painful for me.  It was so real. So, in follow-up programming I would like to see something with the intense acting, superb writing but perhaps a little relief from the drama.  I don't need comedy.  I'm talking some breathing room.  A person needs to be able to breathe when a program is nearly 8 hours long.  Anyway, I'll be taking a peek at what might be happening next in Broadchurch.<br /><br />The rating is appropriate for the content of the subject matter.  There were no scenes of graphic sex or gory violence, (thank goodness!), which is a welcome change of what one normally sees these days in any kind of drama involving murder.  No autopsies or mutilated corpse was depicted.  (The subject matter was horrific enough without adding any of that!) The only sex scene wasof the couple after the act and both were either clothed or completely covered. All of these things are something I greatly appreciate because I don't want to see it.  There is mild swearing that I've come to expect in a program of this rating and I think only one use of the &#34;F&#34; word at the end.ner toward everyone she had known forever.

B000FC1AGG|5.0|So cute - LOVE this story.  Great, easy, FUNNY read - I think funny stories are hard to do, but this managed it well.  Kinsella is a great novelist.
B003VXMMTK|4.0|Well done. Very tragic and melodramatic. But still well done. Not for everyone. I had mixed feelings about it. But there were moments that pulled me through.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|I enjoyed this limited series. The acting is well done and the story was suspenseful. I understand the series will return, but it was nice that it wrapped up in 8 episodes and didn't drag on.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I've only recently started working these puzzles, and I'm glad I found them. They can be easy, hard, or challenging. The only complaint is the larger puzzles are a bit hard to see, but I'm so enjoying the puzzles it doesn't really matter!
B005LAII44|3.0|Never as good as the first one but did have a few stars in it that I watch when they come out in other films.  The addition of the female ninja was a good item and Lady J.  A little more back ground story with how Willis knew her father would have been nice. Since the Cobra commander got away, I am sure there will be a 3rd one coming out shortly.
B006L0A5P8|3.0|It is awesome to have access to my collection of passwords on the Kindle, but this application is really ugly. I hope they give the UI a facelift because estetics is important too.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|Crazy good movie and one of those examples of perception is reality.  It also is a classic example of you see what you want to see and believe what you want to believe even when it often isn't the reality of the situation.  Love can exist but sometimes is not always meant to be.  Great story around all of these themes and as always Matthew McConaughey provides a character you cannot help to love even if they are not the best person out there.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This show continues to shock & surprise me. This DVD set is great to have to watch over & over with friends.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Interesting story line.  The end left some to be desired but the action was good and I was constantly wondering what they were going to do next or see if I could figure out what was going on and I definitely didn't expect the ending so overall good I just would never watch it again.  Once was enough.
0385537816|5.0|Great Read for Adults!! Highly recommend to anyone who likes a little ornery in their life with some fantasy on the side.
0316044695|5.0|I have read and reviewed numerous books on the U.S. Navy SEALS, our elite American warriors.  This excellent book was so fantastic I actually read it twice over the years.  This book (Lone Survivor by Marcus Luttrell with Patrick Robinson), is about Marcus Luttrell, a fire team leader and three of his Seal team mates and friends, who fought a battle with hundreds of Taliban fanatics in the mountains of Afghanistan.  These elite warriors, being out numbered by more than thirty five to one,  fought courageously with only one (Marcus Luttrell) who survived to tell this exciting and fast moving story.<br /><br />The story begins with a short biography of Marcus Luttrell, explaining his early life and how he became a U.S. Navy SEAL.  The training to become a Navy SEAL is told so beautifully that you feel like you are there with Marcus getting &#34;cold, wet and sandy.&#34;  The test of endurance and courage is tested by the brutal and continuing rugged training at BUDS, but that is just the beginning.<br />If you have any desire to become a U.S. Navy SEAL, this book should be required reading.  In fact, every American should read this fantastic book.  This book is so great that a movie is coming out about this story of courage, honor, loyalty and dedication.<br /><br />In conclusion, this short review cannot due justice to just how great this book is to read.  It is a true American story that will forever be burned into your subconscious mind after reading it.<br /><br />Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: The Samurai Soul: An old warrior's poetic tribute)
B0045HCJGC|4.0|Hello out there welcome to this review as part of my 20 years ago 2003 in film reviews & it is for Demolition Man a movie that by far stands the test of time it's kind of scary how this movie predicted things 20 years ago & it's kind of like today. You know how we are becoming a really politically correct society. Guns being outlawed Tobacco products are banned in a way like how The Government hikes the prices of Tobacco Products. Unhealthy food is banned in a way like how you have these Authoritarian's try to portion control us. The chips in people's hands like The RFID chip that Obama supposedly wants us to have. I enjoyed Stallone in this movie cause his character comes from the 90's & he hates this politically correct perfect society. A society that acts childish cutesy & goofy. Which if you brought the 90's style back today you know today's society couldn't handle it case in point is with Wesley Snipes in this movie how he easily handles law enforcement. This movie imo is smarter than what people give it credit for. This movie was a big hit came out 6 months after Cliffhanger which was a big comeback movie for Sylvester Stallone. Directed by Marco Brambilla he directed Excess Baggage & hasn't directed much of anything since which is a shame. Stars Sylvester Stallone as John Spartan, Wesley Snipes as Simon Phoenix, Sandra Bullock as Lieutenant Lenina Huxley, Bob Genion as George Earle, Nigel Hawthorne as Doctor Raymond Cocteau, Dennis Leary as Edgar Friendly & Benjamin Bratt as Alfredo Garcia. The story is you start off in 1996 this LA Detective named John Spartan is after this killer named Simon Phoenix he has this bus full of people being held hostage. John Spartan  is dropped into Simon Phoenix's hideout before he is dropped in on a helicopter he says \\"Send a maniac to catch one.\\" He goes in guns down Simon Phoenix's hench men goes into his office. He won't tell where the hostages are at Simon sets his office on fire & you have John take him down & carry himout. John's Chief is mad cause he blew up another building & that's how John Spartan got his nickname Demolition Man. They find the hostages in the building. John ends up being put in Cryogenic Storage for over 30 years as is Simon Phoenix. Then 36 years later you have a very politically correct society the cities of Santa Barbara San Diego & Los Angles were hit with such a massive Earthquake & have been formed into a mega city called San Angles. Were introduced to Lieutenant Lenian Huxley when she is talking to The Chief she talks to him like a little kid. If you cuss you're ticketed. She has a likable character she likes the society of The 80's & 90's sort of like I do. Plus she is unintentionally funny cause she's always screwing up old sayings she has a partner Alfredo Garcia who is another likable character. Now you have a group of underground resistance fighters lead by a man named Edgar Friendly who is fighting the totalitarianism & this Doctor named Raymond Cocteau has Simon Phoenix unthawed to go kill Edgar Friendly some cops are sent out to arrest Simon Phoenix he uses this Information Booth where he can find out where some guns are out & the machine starts tells him the history of guns Simon cusses the machine out & he is ticketed for it Simon yells f  *  *  k you to the machine it's like he's saying it to today's society. The Cops show up they're no match for Simon. A Cop that was friends with John Spartan thinks he should be unthawed cause John took down Simon Phoenix down before. So he is unthawed & John wants a cigarette but smoking is banned & he finds out soon that cussing is outlawed cause when he was talking to his friend who was a Helicopter Pilot he tells John that he was grounded. John tells him \\"S  h  it you were a d  *  *  n good flyer!\\" He is finned 2 credits he goes right up to that machine & cusses it out this scene was funny which he uses the tickets as toilet paper cause that's been outlawed for being unfriendly to the environment. Johnfinds out that he has chip implanted in his hands & that is scary cause of the whole RFID chip. The only place that has guns is the museum where Simon goes at into The Hall Of Violence he's trying to get some guns a guard comes up & says \\"Gee what's your boggle.\\" Some stupid goofy saying like that Simon takes that guy slams him into the glass display case he starts gathering weapons including some kind of Phasar Gun on the way to the museum Lenina & Officer Garcia play the raidio that has either show tunes playing or cutesy garbage like you hear on the radio today.  They got to the museum John  tries to stop Simon you have a really fun shoot out in the museum where they end up in a replica of an urban area 1 thing leads to another Simon escapes he runs into Dr Cocteau he reminds Simon why he unthawed him John gets outside & Simon gets away Dr Cocteau tells John that he saved his life & invites him to dinner to Taco Bell cause they won the fast food wars. Anyway during dinner you have a group lead by Edgar Friendly start a disturbance cause they're going to steal some food John goes out & fights them off he finds out all they're doing is stealing food. Lenina some surveillance footage John finds out that Dr Cocteau was the 1 who unthawed Simon Phoenix. John finds out that he implanted with Seamstress Skills while he was in Cryo Sleep case he made Lieutenant Huxley a Sweater. John wants to know why Simon Phoenix was implanted with more violent behavior while he was in Cryo Sleep Lieutenant Huxley says that he can't question their Savior almost like you can't question The President or anybody involved in Government. John, Lenian & Officer Garcia go into the sewer to go & warn Edgar Friendly where you get this awesome line by Dennis Leary \\"According to Cocteau's plan I'm the enemy. Cause I like to think. I like to read. I'm into freedom of speech, freedom of choice. I'm the kind of guy who would sit in the greesy spoon & think gee should I have The T Bone Steak or the big rack of Barbecued Spare Ribs with the side order of gravy fries? I want high cholesterol. I want to eat bacon, butter & buckets of cheese alright? I wanna smoke a Cuban Cigar the size of Cincanatti in a non smoking section. I wanna run around with green Jello O all over my body reading a Playboy Magazine. Why? Because I may feel the need to okay? I've seen the future you know what it is? It's made by a 47 year old virgin in grey pajamas soaking in a bubble bath drinking a broccoli milkshake & thinking I'm an Oscar Meyer Weiner. You wanna live on top you gotta live Cocteau's way. What he wants, when he wants it. Your other option come down here maybe starve to death.\\" The fact that stuff like food is attempting to regulated today shows this movie is smarter than people give it credit for. Simon Phoenix says that society has became like The Brady Bunch. Simon has Dr Cocteau unthaw his friends. Simon goes after The Resistance. Simon & his buddies open fire on them with the help of Edgar they run Simon off to the surface. John & Lenina take a Oldsmobile 452 this elevator thing takes them up & it busts through the floor where their in an Oldsmobile Dealership. Simon stole Lenina's Cop Car. You have a very good chase scene he has Lenina take over & drive where he can jump on the car that Simon is in. John tries to throw Simon out of the car during the struggle Simon tells John that he already killed the hostages the night he caught him 36 years ago. John knocks Simon out of the car when he gets control of the car it's malfunctioning the car ends up crashing in front of The Police Station. John is saved by Secure Foam which is like a futuristic air bag. Chief Earle wants to John back into The Cryo Freeze. The Resistance shows up which Office Garcia becomes part of The Resistance. The Chief tells his men to get their Stun Baton's out against a group of people that have guns & The Chief calls them weapons of mass destruction. Edgar says \\"We use these weapons to go groceryshopping..\\" Dr Cocteau tells Simon how he is going to have this perfect society. Simon tells him that he is some kind of evil Mr Rodgers. Jesse Ventura who makes a cameo kills Dr Cocteau. John & Lenina go to The Cocteau building they fight off Simon's goons. Lenina watches John's back & shoots this guy dead who was going to attack him from behind. They find out that Simon is going to unthaw all the criminals John knocks Lenina out with a Stun Baton. He goes & faces Simon Phoenix you have this great finish like when Simon has this claw thing grab John. John tries to free himself plus you have this real knock down drag out fight with Stallone & Wesley Snipes. You don't get a whole lot of fights like this anymore. John smashes Cryo Tube freeze's Simon John is swinging on this cord where he kicks Simon Phoenix's head off.  The facility is going to blow up John gets out of there with The Cryo Prison's gone Dr Cocteau dead the future of San Angles is in the people's hands. John goes off with Lenina & that's pretty much the movie. Final thoughts not only is this a fun comic book style movie smarter than people think. You can tell the budget is on the screen you have likable characters good action scenes. Marco Brambilla did a very good job directing. Sylvester Stallone was great. Wesley Snipes was very good. Sandra Bullock did a good job. Dennis Leary was good. Bob Gunton was ok. Nigel Hawthorne was ok. I am glad I have this in my collection I believe this was the 2nd or 3rd Stallone movie I saw. This movie no matter how you watch it is worth buying hadn't seen it in years. So my next review will be 20 years ago Judgement Night.
B000GOWNPU|4.0|This one is everything you hear about with detention centers - and seemed so believable - good story and really great characters playing it out very well.
B003SNJYSK|5.0|I was lucky enough to spend a week in Norway this summer and I love the whole atmosphere created in these books.  There is a big contrast between the chocolate box image the visitor sees and the dark &#34;Noir&#34; feel of this book in particular.  Nesbo writes thrillers as they should be written, full of threads and intertwining complexity.  The characters are good, but in truth it's all about the dark twists of the plot.  A wonderful writer...<br /><br />As an aside, I wonder if this guy would ever have been published in English?
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|This is an awesome collection of songs.  He seems to have wisdom beyond his years.  Lucky to have found it before my long road trip.
0316247545|5.0|Came in great condition, bright pictures, lots of pages to read, my daughter was so happy to get it and reading it over and over. I just gave it to her for doing great at school, but this book could be a wonderful birthday present too. She loves to sing songs from this book also. Thank you!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was so human and it was interesting to see other people's reactions to given events.  People whom one person thinks is a monster can be such a very nice person who just made a bad mistake.  It was a little hard to get into because at first I did not like it when I would just get into one story and the next chapter was about someone else, but then when they all came together it was a real page turner.  How any things happen in life because you happen to be in one particular spot at one particular time, and how much is predetermined?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Every chapter got my attention. I had to keep reading  to find out what was going to happen next. I was not disappointed chapter after chapter...Looking forward to reading book #2...
B002UBRFDC|4.0|This book is a very good book! It is not only a genuine goddamn page-turner, but it gives the reader an authentic-feeling look at a rich, swashbuckling time period and a glimpse into something of the Japanese cultural mind. It's a tightly drawn but sprawling story about love, politics, people stabbing themselves in the belly, prostitution, more stabbing, and falconry. It is a wholly different world from our own, with foreign characters and perspectives, yet totally human and relatable -- you know, like a goddamn novel. Moreover, Clavell, whom I tend to think of as a masculine writer, draws incredibly complex and powerful female characters in a time and place that ostensibly oppresses females. If you like good books that are long and good, you will like this book!
B002CLBJPK|2.0|Bought this for a granddaughter who loves musicals with children in them.  She does not want to watch this one.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|The editing seems incomplete, and the movie departs from the book in fundamental ways that I found not to my liking.  Still, it is a fun ride.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|As a lifelong fan of Ironman, I found the latest movie more than disappointing. The movie really seemed to drag on with only small hints of action.  The only prolonged action was near the end, which was not sustained, but it was more in the background then the focus of the film.  The usually entertaining smart-assed Robert Downey Jr. character was boring at best.  I only hope Marvel does a better job with this franchise in its Avengers series.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|True to his literary style, Hosseini creates characters of great depth and spins complex and seeminly desparate tales that weave together to form a remarkable whole. Unlike his prior novels which take place only in Afghanistan and the U.S., Hosseini's third novel also takes the reader to France, Greece and Africa.  Hosseini's descriptions are vivid and evocative, painting clear pictures of the vast, harsh Afghan landscape and the sun-drenched Mediterranean.<br /><br />Sad, moving, unforgettable in its pathos \\"And the Mountains Echoed\\" is a novel that will stay with the reader long after the last page has been turned.  If I had one criticism of the book it would be that there was no real happy ending for any of the characters.  In a book full of small and large tragedies, one happy ending would have been a welcome gift to the reader.  Still, the book is well worth reading and highly recommended.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|I'm a bit of a die hard Dylan fan,  although his more recent stuff is hard to like (even though the critics usuallyrave......).  This is a very &#34;listenable to&#34; album of early stuff, some quite catchy, and pleasant to the ear, and well worth getting for anyone who likes early Dylan.  Some nice alternate takes of old familiar songs.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I can log in with any device except the kindle!!! Please fix! I would love to be able to talk to my friends and not being able to use the kindle really pisses me off.
B00F2LIV4E|4.0|Sorry Roadrunner Records, Dream Theater, and Amazon.  $10.49 for a download? No thanks.... Dream Theater are incredible -- one of my favorite bands, but I think I'll wait till there's a good used copy of the CD available for less.
B0092ZEIN4|2.0|I bought the Nyko Playpad intending to use it on my laptop since it had built-in bluetooth. On Nyko's website, they have a somewhat misleading question and answer on the FAQ section of the Playpad page: [...]<br /><br />Will the PlayPad work on PC or Mac?<br />Yes. The PlayPad is recognized as either a GamePad or a Mouse in either GamePad or Mouse mode. To use the PlayPad in GamePad mode, the software must support gamepad input. Please check your software manual for details on gamepad support. In Mouse mode, the PlayPad will allow you to move the cursor, and right and left mouse click.<br /><br />While this isn't necessarily a lie, it doesn't function correctly when in GamePad mode. The left-stick doesn't function as you'd expect. Instead of working as the left-stick on your average console controller, it functions as the D-Pad. You might think that the D-Pad would work as the left-stick, going by the fact that the left-stick is D-Pad. But, no, it's still D-Pad. You effectively have two left-sticks. Besides that, even the buttons don't work correctly; they just don't work.<br />In Mouse mode, it works \\"okay\\". The left-stick moves your cursor, A and right trigger function as left-click, B and left trigger function as right-click, and the home button opens your homepage in your default web browser. This is almost acceptable. The only thing ruining this mode is the fact that the mouse moves incredibly slow.<br /><br />In conclusion, it works on PC, but not the way you want it to. Don't expect to be playing games with it on your computer. Just don't buy it, save your money.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game would tell all my friends and family and it is full of puzzles and fun keep someone busy all night long
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Elvis said music changes every six months ...well this girl has changed music again. I was blown-away the first time I heard Royals! I knew I was hearing a truly unique voice, and a new voice in music. Lorde is 16 ...16! However, her music isn't the typical cotton candy sound many artists in her age group produce. Lorde's songs have simple, but powerful beats. Tennis Court, the first song, is a little bit teeny ...but after that the songs get good, real good! Ribs WILL BE the next hit ...I knew it the second I heard it! I liked her sound so much the first time I heard it I went and purchased the actual CD ...I haven't purchased a CD in 10+ years.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Great follow-up to Nightmare.  I think this album rocks and I like how they pay homage to Metallica, GnR, and Iron Maiden by writing songs that could have come off the Black, Appetite and Powerslave albums.<br /><br />I'll skip all the artsy babble and just say I love this album.  If you like hard rock, you'll like this.  'Nuff said.
B00CATSONE|4.0|it open my mind to different perspective in  life. very interesting book kept me reading until the end. could not stop. ha ha
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|I like Stephen King novels and had not read the Shining original book until recently as I knew the story to an extent due to the well known film. I enjoyed it but must say that this follow up is far better. It follows the story of Dan as an adult (he was the little boy in the original book) and is so well crafted by King it is hard to put down. I don't want to spoil the plot but can tell you that the tension created throughout is excellent and I was really worried at one stage that it was going to be a tragic ending but always trust King to come good making a dramatic but truly satisfying ending.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|makes me have a heart attack every time. I have the PC version as well and both have the same heart attack scares. get this app if you like the PC!!!!
B00ESY77LO|4.0|THIS MOVIE IS SLOW IN THE BEGINNING BUT PULLS YOU IN WITH BEAUTIFUL CINEMATOGRAPHY.  YOUR IMAGINATION IS EMERSED IN THE TIME PERIOD.  DICAPRIO PUTS IN ANOTHER STELLAR PERFORMANCE!
B009C7JS14|3.0|I like the app because it shows in my notification slide and also it is accurate and never let me down in the morning it really helps me keep it moving
B000SKSXYM|5.0|I bought this a few months ago used. It was very hard for me to find this exact record with the posters for a reasonable price (Some sites and sellers wanted $150+ for it). Anyway I found this on here for about $25 with not one but two of the Bicycle Race posters!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick Riordon`s books are so good. I would recommend this series: Percy Jackson,to anyone 8 through 15. This series helps your child learn about Greek mythology.
B000WCDI64|5.0|This is one of the greatest performance dvd's I own. While it's quite obvious that she's stoned/drunk throughout this performance, she does a very good job of putting on a good show (unlike another artist who doesn't do a good show when stoned *cough* Marilyn Manson*cough*) It's a shame that she passed away and can't do anymore shows or music, I would've loved to go to one of her concerts, this will be the closest I'll ever get.
B000H7JD90|5.0|One of my favorite albums, and it sounds fantastic on vinyl.  Fully satisfied. Came factory sealed and no damage in shipping.
B00915G6SU|5.0|Never disappointed! Love this series...can't wait for the next one! Maybe I shouldn't watch them so fast...grab your popcorn, and a cold one.
B00AEBBAEU|5.0|I love how PTA's two recent films are described as character studies. We have to genrify everything. These films are definitely more than character studies. Roger Ebert said he wasn't sure about There Will be Blood, which was an honest critical response. The film is a work of art. Of the highest order. I felt at the time that he had entered the realm of very few directors and only two other Americans (Stanley Kubrick and Terrence Malick). Now, his films will be debated, hated, and rigorously questioned. I've read some bizarre analysis of THERE WILL BE BLOOD which factually the film cannot support. I've read some penetrating thoughts which the film does lend a hand to. The real issue is that Anderson's film doesn't endorse fully any interpretation. That is the point. It is what you bring to the film that gets you to the other side. After watching the critical and popular opinions flip flop for Malick, Kubrick and Tarkovsky (as well as Eisenstein, Kalatazov, Lang and Renoir) you would think we would learn to give a film like this time to gestate. It will of course. The film has already become different in my mind from the first time I saw it. I stopped looking for overweaning greatness and found simplicity and the quiet grace of empathy in it's cinematography. I find it asking questions but not necessarily answering them. Becoming okay with that in a narrative is I think the importance of art.
B004G600A4|5.0|I bought this movie for my granddaughter it is one of her favorites, as a matter of fact her brother likes it too.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is a super fun app that lets you take challenges to save the lives of cute little creatures(or at least that's what I think they are) from bad events such as getting hit by a train! You unlock new creatures/people for your train station. Get this app! You won't regret it!<br /><br />----NMS----

B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I purchased the complete third season of The Walking Dead because I don't have access to AMC tv and I started watching this series on Netflix, but it seems to take too long for the new seasons to appear on Netflix.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I've been a Korn fan since the 90's, and there have been some great albums and some not so great albums since then. Unlike most, I never felt that Korn have \\"lost their way\\" instead appreciating each album for what they were, rather than what I thought they should be. Their previous album, \\"The Path of Totality,\\" made it really hard for me to appreciate because it lost one of the most important things that made Korn what they are, their instruments. In that album, Jonathan's vocals were great, but you couldn't tell the difference between an actual instrument and a computer-generated sound from time to time. Many fans were worried that future albums would have the same problem, the \\"Metalstep\\" sound. Thankfully, that's gone.<br /><br />Other reviews have accused this new album of some of the same problems, of including Metalstep (Dubstep-infused Metal) like the previous album, but that is definitely not the case. Some of the Metalstep elements of the past album is still present, but only in the form of special effects used only when necessary. The guitars lead this album, and it features some of the best work Korn has ever done.<br /><br />When guitarist Head was announced to return, many assumed that it would mark the return of Korn's '90's style. Anyone that knows this band, knows that they refuse to follow any preconceived formula. Instead of a clone of Self Titled, or Life is Peachy, we get a brand new Korn sound that they've never done before. This album features a brand new, somewhat darker (and sometimes creepy) sound infused with elements from past albums for safe measure. Although their style has been reinvented, it still manages to give a listening experience similar to their Untouchables album, which is deep and takes a few listens to \\"get it.\\" That said, I loved the album from the beginning, but I love it even more now that I've heard it over ten times.<br /><br />The lead single from the album (Never Never) had fans worried, because that song sounds likesomething that could have been on \\"The Path of Totality\\", heavily influenced by Dubstep. In fact, in Never Never, you can barely notice the guitars at all. The single was massively hated and became an instant black eye for the band, somewhat of a laughing stock. Due to that single, many have written off this album before it was released. But let me assure you, although I don't hate the song like other people do, Never Never is easily the worst song on the album. In fact, the second single (Love & Meth) isn't ground breaking either. The rest of the album though, is astonishing. It's extremely surprising how good this album is, it has the right mix of both the old and new styles, forming a new style that is quite possibly their best yet. The instrumentation, vocals, everything is great!<br /><br />Highlights for me include \\"Lullaby for a Sadist,\\" \\"Victimized,\\" \\"It's All Wrong,\\" and \\"Mass Hysteria.\\"<br /><br />The one thing I can complain about is the Autorip feature of this album. I preordered the Deluxe CD/DVD edition, and I got an email this morning that the Autorip version has been added to my Cloud Player, but was disappointing to find out that it's the standard edition, NOT the deluxe edition, so I'll still have to rip the disc myself. What's the point of offering Autorip, if the MP3 edition you're given is not the same one you've purchased?
B00EQRP5LW|5.0|I don't normally review albums as I believe everyone's taste in music is different. But this album is excellent from beginning to end. My mother is a huge John Legend fan & kept hinting that she wanted the album. I heard good things about it online & from someone that I follow on twitter whose musical taste are similar to mine. Needless to say I love it! Let me also say that if you are not or have never been in love, then this might not be the album for you. You can hear the love in his voice, lyrics and throughout the album. The production on the album is phenomenal as well. If you are a John Legend family & have been from the beginning of his career then you can surely see the growth. So if you love LOVE & good music in addition to a well produced album, then this is the album for you.
B00F9A903O|5.0|you dont need money to play the game as stated. if you are patient enough you can play through the game fine. i like the graphics and the mechanics are easy to play. as a little tip, when they ask you to use in game money to speed up a product during the intro of how to play, just wait and you dont have to use a any.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Good writing, some of those experiments work!  Felt myself absorbed in the book quickly. Started trying it out immediately . FUN
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I so enjoy Stephen King. What a master at story telling. Such a treat to revisit these characters after so long apart.
B000SEFNMS|3.0|It is pretty typical Krakauer. He inserts himself into the story and creates an irrelevant tangent for a chapter.  Otherwise, the storyline was mildly interesting.
0446699616|4.0|Enjoyed The Panther and strongly recommend it, as it's well researched on Yemen, a very exotic environment for FBI, CIA, AlQueda, and the tribes in interaction. Found it very hard to put down. Very enjoyable!
B000NGTJTY|4.0|Great acting, directing, atmosphere.  DiCaprio and Nicholson brilliant as always as undercover cop and mafia boss.  Score another fine film from Martin Scorsese.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Kept my interest throughout the book, and enjoyed the twists in the story, though found the ending a little too far fetched.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Excellent. All the same features as my wife's Kindle Fire! The ability to adjust font size is a must on some devices and Kindle for Android does it all!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Downloaded it to my Kindle Fire and thought that my grandson (6) would like to play it. It seemed a little complicated for a 6 year old and didn't hold his interest so we deleted it. Not saying that you wouldn't like the game just not for my 6 year old. Enjoy :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|wow downloaded this to my Kindle Fire it works on the WIFI really great. Holds your points and my 6 year old loves the graphics and I catch him laughing while he plays. It also comes in different languages so when you set it up watch what you pick. They talk and sing and it seems to keep my grandson very interested. :)
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I haven't yet finished this book but I can hardly put it down.  The characters are engaging and the adventure Harold is on simply pulls you along with him.
B007THA4FI|1.0|One of the worst books I've ever encountered.  It is nothing but example after example of the WORST traits of human beings.  Poorly organized and generally just a beating.  I finished the whole thing hoping at least ONE character would redeem themselves in some way.  I rather think the author needs some personal counseling.  How does she exist in this sort of world view?
0385349947|4.0|Sheryl is someone I admire.  This book is good advice for women trying to handle the balance between work and family.  I also encourages us to &#34;Lean In&#34; and &#34;Sit at the Table&#34;.  A quick must-read!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Great Book!  Fascinating concept.  I was very intrigued by this concept.  I have started this program and the fasting is much easier than expected.  It was a great read both my husband and I enjoyed very much.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Pros:<br />Setup was quick and easy<br />I am a Movie/TV fanatic. I have many other means of streaming (smart TV, Roku), but when I saw this for $35, and the ability to stream from the Ipad to the TV without having to hook up the Ipad (yes I have the apple accessory) I jumped. There are also a number of shows that I can only access on the PC. Chromecast handles this also when using Chrome to access the web.<br />Cons:<br />I was getting some delay when streaming from the PC (may be my network, it was better on my desktop vs my Laptop)<br />Need more APPS<br />Need to get Tablet/Smart Phone Apps onboard
B00127RAJY|4.0|Excellent workout, currently on day 5 and I'm seeing the results already!  It's hard to mix it up which could become boring. I decided to use 3# weights on day 1-5 then 5# weights on day 6-10 so hopefully that will give me better results :)
B000X2H8G4|5.0|It does the job for my hearing aid replacement.  The price is good, the mic is a little too long , so I cut it as short as it was possible.
B000ICXQXI|1.0|I have seen the movie before and I know it is a good film. I was not able to watch the movie because of it Freezing up, and I would have to log out and login several times . After the third time I gave up.(I did a  test on my internet to verify everything was good on my end)I didn't have time to watch it the next day, so basically I threw away my money, right into Amazons pockets. I'm only going to use the free prime movies from now on.....If you have never had to contact Amazon, be aware, it is nearly impossible...by design.<br />Lesson is stick with netflix , Hulu, redbox or vudu.
1400032717|5.0|I bought this to read as part of a book club at work.  I was so intrigued with the story that I read it in one day!  As an engineer, I loved the math and science terms that were included, but not to fear if you're not familiar, they are also explained!<br /><br />It was great to gain the perspective of the main character in this book, definitely eye opening!
B005UG542S|5.0|Loved it, would watch again. Good ending to the series. Thought the ending was kinda cheesey. but still a good movie
1603429999|5.0|Another reference book for my hobbies.  This one has been very helpful and I love benefiting from someone elses' great experience....especially with knitting!
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|The author was to self absorbed in his own agenda to do any justice to what and who Jesus was. If you want to know who Jesus was and why were here read The Urantia Book.
B004CURZFC|1.0|boring, we turned it off before the end.  My son thought the same thing and lost interest in the film.
0399159347|5.0|Written by Liane Moriarty, an Australian author, this book is an engrossing and compelling examination of the entwined lives of three unsuspecting families!  Each chapter draws you further into their stories.
B000002G30|5.0|Easily one of the best albums ever written. Too bad everything after this is horrible. This, and the albums before it are all you need from Monster Magnet.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I thought it was kinda lame, expected more but too kiddy for my taste. I tried it a few times.
B00DJ6KYWQ|5.0|This author cannot write them quick enough for me. Riveting read and one you cannot put down until the last page
B000FCKIXW|1.0|I admire Google as a company, and would even call my self a fan-boy, but this book is nothing more than a promotional flyer. Sergey Brin and Larry Page are super cool to the point that you just end up rolling your eyes. Nothing ever goes wrong, everything \\"google\\" is just magnificent.<br />\\"Losing my virginity\\"- Richard Brandson's journey with virgin and \\"Masters of doom\\" following ID software are far more real and interesting. I gave up on the google story about a third of the way in.
B000059LGC|4.0|An interesting mystery with good actors in all the parts. I love a good mystery. And most of Christie's mytsteries, I think, are good. I recommend the movie to oldeer teens and adults.
B008LC8TJI|4.0|I did not realize just HOW explicit the lyrics of this CD would be. I had only heard the radio version of some of the songs. Really enjoy the music, but can't listen to it with others in the car. Next Time I'll be careful to avoid any CDs marked &#34;explicit&#34;!
034580404X|5.0|I loved it, it was really worth reading! and Im looking forward to the movie next year. I hope its as good as the books.
B00F2P8ZDC|4.0|The kids love this one.<br /><br />Great kids movie,  classic Disney,  great songs,  great characters.  Perfect for the Disney princess fan.

B004UJTG6Q|3.0|This was a good book to read and I learned a lot from this book. I also think it's funny because I have a uncle named Tom and his last name Sawyer
B000L43AN4|5.0|Tom has always been a master songwriter.  He once told me to never let a rhyme interfere with the power of the lyric.  In my opinion Tom Waits IS the songwriter of the century.
1568363931|5.0|A must have! All variety of ideas in this book and super easy to follow! Seriously, this is a great tool for your Bento box lunches!
0399255370|5.0|I came across this book on the web and thought it was so cute I immediately requested that my library purchase it.  If finally came in and my 6 year old loved it!  She read it the first time to herself while I was cooking and then we read it again together tonight. It was a bundle of laughs for both of us as each crayon wrote a letter to its owner, Duncan, with a list of gripes.  Gray feels over used as the little boy loves to color in huge elephants, hippos and more with gray and the gray crayon suggests why not draw a baby penguin or a gray pebble instead?  Each color has it's own hilarious complaint which leads Duncan to ponder how can he make his crayons happy.  The ending is a picture Duncan drew that shows his creative usage of colors to solve each crayon's problem.  My daughter and I especially loved going over this last drawing figuring out all the changes Duncan had made in his drawing out of consideration for his box of crayons.  A wonderful book that your kids will ask to read over and over and also a delight for parents!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|We already owned the first five seasons so wanted to continue with purchasing the season.  This is a funny show if you like this style of humor.  They have really started to come into their characters over the six seasons and am enjoying the 7th season on tv now.
B00004RFFI|4.0|My son has probably watched this movie over 100 times now that we have bought this! I looked everywhere and no one had this movie except Amazon!
B008AIGWVA|5.0|This game is so much fun for my 3 year old. I don't mind playing it either to pass some time! Very cute!
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|If you like Metallica, Chevelle, hard rock and catchy, fast tunes that make you want to jump on a sportbike and blast down the road or get on a snowboard and rip down a mountain then this is great stuff.  Check out their older albums as well. Amazing band.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|This is THE BEST concert that Beyonce has ever done in my opinion. I LOVE this concert, and I know every word to every song on the dvd. I love everything about this dvd. Team Beyonce for the win!!!
B002RKSZS0|5.0|This is one of my favorite books by Jane Austen.  In fact, I try to read them all as I like to read them over and over again whenever I can.  Thank you.  It is great to read it on my kindle.
B0049U4INC|5.0|Absolutely one of the BEST books I have ever read!  I think it will change my life - seriously!  THANK YOU, GUY KAWASAKI, for sharing your brilliant thoughts with a world full of (mostly) ordinary people.
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|Can't stop listening to this album!  There are some artists that come to mind when HAIM is playing - Prince, Michael Jackson, Fleetwood Mac - but there's no mistaking the sound is all HAIM and it's wonderful.

B0050R0YB8|4.0|A fun build overall and my first introduction to Lego Star Wars sets.  A few things did not fit together quite as intended and it could get frustrating at times, but it was probably overly ambitious to start with this set.  The final product looks good and it was enjoyable to construct it.  I am concerned if I ever have to move it, since it seems like things can fall apart easily due to its large size.  Other sets are smaller and perhaps more self-contained.  Recommended, but not necessarily as a first build.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Thank you for the loving, and witty way you impart this information! I did not want this book to end, and I am sure I will continue to review and reread, with more joy and understand each time.
B000P0J0G0|5.0|How do you summarize a show like this one? Maybe you don't. For better or worse, some reviewers have compared it to Monty Python. The verdict's still out on that, unless it is a reference to the random formatting of the show through the years.<br /><br />They lampooned, they parodied, they attacked...but they usually did it without ruffling a hair out of place, and they only seldom swore compared to some of the pure stand-up figures of history. The few moments they spent on screaming fits or foul language are mostly so well-timed that they just made the big picture even funnier. There is something intriguing about a duo that can do such busy things without losing composure or having a fit of camera shyness even once. It seems that the ridiculousness of their comedy style was invented for their own amusement, and all the better if some people laughed on the right part of the joke. Some people have complained that the show feels dated now. Well, yes, that's becoming true with each passing year, but these sketches are still heaps less topical than many other shows of this era. Many of the skits are based so much on \\"verbal frotting\\" (to quote Fry) that this factor is quite forgivable.<br /><br />The writing is typically very smart - it's certainly not exclusionary in the MENSA fashion, but viewers who excel at public debating, writing, or simply read their brains out will really enjoy the subtleties. The way the scripts are delivered is proof positive of just how smart Fry & Laurie are (perhaps a little too smart, since it was later revealed that both of them have dealt with severe mood problems). At the same time, the \\"vox pops\\" and occasional fits of completely random lines or sketches - Tony Inchpractice for one -  save the show from becoming snobbish. The on-stage music you find in some episodes is not variety show music but rather a parody or \\"silly song,\\" and even these portions are amusing in some way (Hugh Laurie really shines in these moments of fusing his music and comedy skills together).<br /><br />I will admit that the show is a mixed bag in some ways. I hardly laugh at all for the \\"Tony & Control\\" bits, but love so many other characters (check out the unapologetic take on \\"Oprah\\") that I choose to simply skip over the less funny parts instead of rip them apart in an Amazon review. I'm not saying that these actors or their show is infallible, but I *am* saying that it's not worth bashing the entire series just for a few less-than-golden moments.<br /><br />As a fun bonus, season 2's disc also has the lengthy \\"Cambridge Footlights Revue\\" episode that Fry and Laurie did together in the early 1980s (look for the excellent tribute to \\"Dracula\\").
B000P12LWY|4.0|Entertaining, with great sets.<br />This is a not a formal documentary and Jonathan Meyers doesn't look anything like HenryVIII.<br />It's hard to top Keith Michell as Henry and his performance sets the standard.<br />However, the acting is still good and the casting was done well.<br />This is a Tudor soap opera that sometimes plays fast and loose with the script and events.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Easy on eyes and to setup to use like the  choices for what I choose to use  to b e alerted with  and sound choices
B000FC1AGG|2.0|Overall the book isn't bad. At times the main character, Emma, can be quite frustrating. She isn't a strong female character and her constant self-consciousness becomes annoying. I decided to finish the book because I had already dedicated time to reading half of it, so it didn't make sense to just give it up. It's an easy read and would be a decent summer read by the pool.
B00DHPN7G4|5.0|The Xbox 360 controller always felt comfortable but the thumbsticks always felt loose which made aiming on shooters and steering on racers inaccurate and sloppy. I purchased a tournament controller which allowed tension adjustment for the thumbsticks but everything else about the controller was poor and it was cheaply made and uncomfortable, even the triggers were uncomfortable. I tried to tolerate it because the tension adjustment was just that good. Well the controller kept failing so eventually I went back to the 360 controller, which is far more comfortable, and tolerated the &#34;sloppy&#34; thumbsticks until now that is. These AAA Shocks are a perfect solution! They come with varying resistance and easily slip over the thumbsticks. I can aim with better precision and race more smoothly. I play F1 2012 with the assists turned off (assist are for the kids) so precision steering is a must to stay on the track and these AAA Shocks make it pleasurable to race this way. Now I can use the best controller with a much improved thumbsticks solution. I hope they will make these Shocks for Xbox One. Highly recommended.
B00F5F0208|4.0|Drake does it again. This album is diverse but doesn't stray away from the Drake formula. I don't know that the complete album is the best work but it is a must have for sure.
0399226907|5.0|I never read this book to my own children. Somehow, we missed it. However, it became a great favorite in my grandson's library and we have read it time and time again. The cycle of life, from egg, to caterpillar to cocoon and finally butterfly is taken step by beautiful step. Carle's gentle humor makes the insect a personality filled with wonder at his own growth. Reading it together, I love to build the tension until the ending , when the cocoon changes into a wonderful new creature. We have a new love for our flying friends now, and have even grown our own butterflies. It was as wondrous as reading this book.
0141182601|4.0|Normally, after finishing a great book I wish I had read it earlier in life (say high school considering I'm only in college).  But, while A Clockwork Orange is a great story, it is not for the faint of heart.  The graphic and brutal story along with sometimes difficult made up slang Anglo-Russian words makes the short book a much more difficult read than expected.  Again, the story is great and the theme of whether it is better to naturally be bad or made to be good is an interesting topic, but realize the graphic lens the story is told through before opening the book.
0060245867|5.0|My daughter in law told me to buy this book. She was a babysitter for years and loved this series. What a fun and enjoyable read. Numeroff has an adorable sense of the absurd that tickles both the reader and the listener. We read the book several times, enjoying that with each action we take, their outcome will be bigger and greater to deal with. A very important concept for children to learn. No matter what we do, somewhere things may change and we should decide before we do it, if we will be happy with the consequences. A wonderfully deep book, that can be mistaken for lightweight reading, Numeroff manages convey a very complex lesson with humor and verve.
B00D8WJ9JK|1.0|I have heard some of the songs that J Cole has had out.  I thought he was a very talented man.  I purchased the album and was disappointed.  I heard the talent behind this man.  However, I did not like what he had to say.  All he talked about was P----y this and s--k that!  I feel like it was not done in taste.  I like some of the songs that actually has to do with something like She Knows or Let Nas Down.  However, Nas was not the only one he let down.  He defiantly let me down.  I love hip hop, R and B and Rap.  But, I felt he really had nothing to say except for money, chains, B----hes and h--s....I am truly disappointed on his perception of females.  Probably most of his fans are females at that.  I was insulted and wanted a refund.  I deleted his MP3 album of of my Mp3 player.  I listen to my music at work at a dog pound and work very hard.  I listen to my music to make it though the day because I work really hard. The last thing I need is some negative rapper in my ear insulting me...
0452282152|5.0|A beautiful landscape of 17th Century Holland, this rich book made me a Tracey Chevalier fan. Her deep understanding of servant life, she introduces us to Griet, a maid forced to work for the famous painter Vermeer and his demanding household. Though her station keeps her below stairs, the connection between the painter Vermeer and his young maid is bittersweet and romantic. A stunning story of unrealistic love, ambition, and the final hurt, this is a stunning book that is so subtle, the final showdown between Vermeer and the young maid left me breathless. Chevalier is a master storyteller, who creates a lush backdrop to her story line. Multidimensional, colorful, unforgettable, this remains one of the best books I have ever read!
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Oh my goodness. This album is the best.  Janelle is so talented and works with some of the most talented artists in history.  This is a great honor for her and the artists she works with only work with the best.  The has worked with Prince and Stevie Wonder, Cee Lo Green, Erykah Badu just to name a few.  She experimented with many different instruments and genres of music such as rock n roll, R @ B, hip hop and blues. My two favorite songs on the album is Q.U.E.E.N and Givin Em What They Love and Can't live Without Your Love. I simply love the smoothness in her voice.  She has had much practice in vocals.  Janelle was studying to be in Broadway so you know she talented.  I promise this album wont let you down.  Get it and listen to it a time or two.  It might not be something you are used to.  She has really grown as an artist and the album won't let you down.
0694003611|5.0|I never read this book to my own children, somehow I missed it when they were little. For my first Christmas as a grandmother, my dear friends bought this book with a tape recorder built in, so I could read it to him without being there. I adore this book. It tempo is peaceful, calming a a perfect bedtime book to read cuddled together. I purchased a second one, and to my delight, my grandson had memorized the entire book, down to my exact inflection. I taped him reading it to me, and now now only does he go to sleep with my words echoing in his head, so does do I.
B009NH6AOQ|4.0|Wow, I thought it really showed incompetence on Rick for loosing the little girl. Then they took forever finding her.<br />She just disappeared. Lame, lame. lame. It really made for a horrible and weak story. Otherwise season 2 was ok, but<br />if you can't come up with a better plot, don't use the \\"someone is lost theme\\" for so long. Just have her turn into a zombie,<br />shoot her in the head and move onto the next sequence. I hate it when story writers try to buy time.This part of the series was really disapointing!!!
0143124544|5.0|Jojo Moyes I have a bone to pick with you.  Actually, I am a little angry!  You write so well, so thought provoking.  You story grabbed my attention and wouldn't let me loose until I finished the last page of your book.  You had me guessing which way each character was heading, from the A plots to the B plots, and I cared so much.  I am furious with you because you kept me honorable, as tired as I was, I wouldn't peek and let myself spoil the tension you built.  You made me blush with shame when I realized all the simple heartache people with challenges face.  Even though I have two such people in my life, your reflections hurt and now I am mad because I can't say more.  I don't want to spoil this book for anybody else.<br /><br />So today if I am grumpy from lack of sleep, impatient because the only thing I really want to think about is the characters who became my friends last night- I am blaming you, JOJO!  And right after that I am going out and buying everything else you've written!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Didn't like this product waste of money.  Didn't work any better than the orignal product.  And not worth the shopping it doesn't work.
B002KYHZLQ|3.0|I'm almost ditched this book after the first few chapters. I was lost. I had no grasp of the characters, the world or the conflict in general. Quite frankly almost none of the characters are endearing. Yet, I kept reading and will say that once I organized everyone in my mind I began to see this complicated world for what it was, choas. I'm hoping that the next book is more easy to get now that I have more of an idea of who each character is and what nickname or sir name is referencing. I can see the potential here and hate to think I wasted so much effort getting through this book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The book was fluid and difficult to put down I highly recommend it. The detail is unmatched.  The movie did not match the books fluidity.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'd always heard about this book from friends who enjoyed the same books as me, and after finishing Ender's Game I wish I had listened to them earlier.  It's amazing how well Orson Scott Card was able to tell a great story while also including an underlying theme that was obviously a comment on humanity and his views of humanity at the time of writing the book.  Awesome read with some very well developed characters! I can't wait to read other books from this series.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|i just loved it!<br /><br />i recommended to a lot of people.<br />very practical, thats for me is great, tired of reading and reading.... but this book is so entertained!
B00E9P957Q|5.0|This is not a Box Set with extra tracks, etc, but is very cheap way of getting the Atlantic Albums, the are faithful to the original artwork and the winner in here is the remixed version of Vapor Trails.
B00EO10M54|5.0|This is an amazing CD! I enjoyed all the songs but my favorites have to be Wrecking Ball, FU, Maybe You're Right, Drive and, Someone Else.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|This book was good for the genre, but nothing surprised me and seemed very familiar to other titles such as Harry Potter and the Twilight series...but not as well written.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|I first heard Kelly speak at a TED Talk.  It inspired me to Google her where I found her book.  The insights in this book are deep & profound.  Kelly shines a light into areas of my mind that I didn't even know we're dark.<br />I am so grateful for these ideas and for a renewed chance to get more understanding of my behavior and some practical tools to empower me to follow my deepest will.<br />Thanks Kelly,... Great Job,<br />--Jordan Hale
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Good time killer especially if you like rail type games, gets a little crazy later in missions which amps up the challenge level.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Despite some of the lukewarm reviews from the literary press, I found David and Goliath to do what Gladwell does best: He takes complex topics new to the reader and makes them relatable and inspiring to everyday life. My only quibble is that it's harder  to connect with someone who cures cancer or leads the civil rights movement than how it takes 10,000 hours to be good at something -- or a late birthday may have had a role in your kid's middling sports prowess. But the chapter on Big Fish/Little Pond is a keeper -- and one that will undoubtedly help guide our 15 year old to the college that's right for him and help to set a career trajectory fueled by love of learning, not status of institution.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|mr legend's new album has a warmer, vulnerable and more poignant feel than his earlier ones. i really have been enjoying it at home and my 9 year old mali, has as well (some of the songs he's heard). many congratulations to the man john legend.xxx
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Exotic and enticing!  This was one of those stories that kept me reading far too late every night. The author offered fantastic imagery coupled with a gift for telling a flowing and interesting story. Wonderfully thought out with a concrete beginning and end, and yet the feeling that the story could continue forever. I absolutely loved every minute.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Maybe I am jaded because the early books were SO good and SO different. Patricia Cornwell has, in my opinion, been THE reason we have all of the shows about forensics and strong women in law enforcement these days.  I am sure it has become harder for me as a reader to find the good or the novel in the Scarpetta series, no pun intended, when it should be enough that the author is consistently excellent. Ms Cornwell does continue to reveal new techniques, technologies or entities from real-life that I find fascinating. However, hearing about Scarpetta finding herself in physical jeopardy in several of the books stretches my disbelief, especially when surrounded and rescued by super humans like Lucy and Benton.  It has gotten too close to becoming a cartoonish crime fighting team like Justice League.
B00EM764ZC|3.0|OK, but not as good as the client on my Galaxy S3 phone.  No other real decent map apps out there.
B007HACDLK|4.0|A good, suspenseful read.  Flynn takes us on a good ride with familiar characters, older and wiser, but no less exciting.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|This was a really fun game. I downloaded it for a flight and played it for the whole trip. Fluid movement and didnt lag.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Love Streisand ..songs reminds me of touching moments in my life..all artists joining this most extraordinary artist are top notch..The CD ..plays over and over in my car..it's a treasure.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great detail and what a great way to tell the story. From the perspective of those who took place in it even if it fiction. I saw the movie first and was told to read the book it's very very different man they couldn't be more right! Anyway it was a fun read that's hard to put down. At only 340 pages or so it's a quick read as well but well worth the time and money! The best book I've read in a long time.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It's not the most complex story in the world but I ripped through it. The references were just so spot on to how I grew up and what I liked. Good wall down memory lane.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very handy so I Can check battery status so I'm not surprised when I get a low battery message. I can make sure it's charged.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|It has lots of minor adventures and is very descriptive. Tom and Huck live very happily in the end. I like stories that end with a happy ending. Tom encounters some days that change his life completely. This book makes you want to read more each time you stop.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This story is the forerunner for the foster care program that exists today. Beautifully written tales of what it was and how to survive the loss of your family. To imagine being sent in a train to find a \\"family\\" vs being slave labor  horrifying yet not being able to see what back bone and determination to survive can get you. Well done great book
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|One of the most inspiring books I've ever read, WONDER has captivated my thoughts days after I finished the book. Written simply and marvelously, a truly wondrous book.<br /><br />Reviewed by Morgan's Daughter, Zoe (Age 10)

B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I'm ten years old , my mom bought me this app. And it asks me for my Facebook! I don't even dream other having a Facebook account till I'm like sixteen or so. Nor does my mom or dad have a Facebook account so I just ignored it.
B009LDD590|5.0|This is a great series! Can't wait for season 4 to be released..I would recommend getting all three seasons. Great story line and acting.
B008476HBM|5.0|I have always loved the movie so I decided to read the book it was based on and was not disappointed  it is now forever my favourite book the story is ageless every women should at some point in her life indulge in Jane Austen's novels and having read all of them after this one must say this is the best of all!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Very easy read & simple experiments that work. Enjoyed the book a lot & had fun with the homework included.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book has everything you need. It has romance, conflict, love, and everything in between. I loved it. It has everything I love in a book.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This is fun, but it is SO SLOW AND GLITCHY! This is NOTHING compared to the real Minecraft. Even the demo for th  real Minecraft is better! This is a waste of time, and even a waste of no money, which is pretty sad. I have a Kindle Fire HD and it is just HORRIBLE!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I dont even watch youtube videos I just download them now and watch everywhere whenever I want with no lag. All you have to do is download once with high speed connection and watch wherever cannot beat it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If I could give this infinity Times infinity stars out of 5, I would!!!!! It is NOT BORING, IGNORE OTHERS! I love it, and didn't waste one single penny. This was probably the most-cost-worthy apps on my Kindle Fire HD, even with free ones. I especially like the cute solicitors and  the cutest baby sheep EVER!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I've read the Kite Runner, and now this novel. I admire the dense details, the unexpected but very realistic emotions, and the way he translates the afghani culture. The weaving in of French culture reminds me of the influence it has on people I know from Iran, too. This novel spares us from the brutality of his first novel, which left me with a very real sense of despair for the Afghani people. One suspects that as Mr. Hosseini matures, his characters develop into more optimistic beings! I like that. Lastly, his unique perspective as an Afghan-American is refreshingly honest. His lyrical writing is a treasure.
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|I really loved it and it talks to me. unputdownable and totally funny. I recommend it totally to anyone. great
B005LAIIGW|5.0|This movie features an unbelievable adventure.<br /><br />This is a 3D space movie. The 3D is not obtrusive but actually helps the movie as it progresses.<br /><br />The movie was co-written, co-produced, co-edited and directed by Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n. It stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts who survive a damaged Space Shuttle. The movie features something like an odyssey--going from a shuttle to the international space station to. . .<br /><br />Sandra Bullock makes a good case for an Oscar nomination. She does a tour de force in her role. I am not sure that her recollection of her daughter helps a great deal, but it does humanize her. Clooney does a fine job as her partner as things go from bad to worse. Things in the movie look bad? They get worse!<br /><br />The special effects are wonderful. The tension is gripping. The movie moves ahead with a momentum that is compelling.<br /><br />This is one fine movie. Well worth attending to.
0312430000|5.0|For essentially my entire professional career I have been trying to (a) help figure out the right way to do things and (b) get everyone to do things the same way. When we write standard operating procedures to accomplish that, there is always a push and pull of folks who want the long version, with every 'why' dotted, and folks who want the short, sweet version. This book was a revelation to me: It explains why both groups are right, and how they can interact. The long version is great for new folks, documentation, and reference;  the checklist is great for experts. Now we can all get along!<br /><br />In the process of explaining this, Mr. Gawande tells interesting, well-crafted stories that would be worth reading even if you did not have a checklist of your own to develop.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|This is a book everyone who wants to know what the essence of what the Cold War was about. A great, very scary read.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|As someone who didn't watch the original Star Trek series or movies, I find myself thoroughly enjoying this new remix of Star Trek.  Chris Pine is suburb as Captain Kirk - loveable, yet brash and arrogant.  The rest of the cast is great as well.<br />I keep telling my friends, you don't have to be a Trekkie to enjoy this movie!
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Fun.....Love this game....farming is great.... picking g flowers and watering trees...harvesting corn and growing pumpkins for Halloween....honey is great to eat...
B001NLKWLW|5.0|A great book to lose yourself in. Loved all the different stories and how the connections made themselves  apparent  through time and alternating points of view.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|\\"World War Z\\" (2013)<br />. . .<br /><br />We enjoyed this one - I thought it was a good, intelligent zombie flick, more in the hyper-realist mode of \\"28 Days\\" and \\"The Walking Dead\\" rather than the camp horror of the George Romero franchises. I'm not normally a big Brad Pitt fan, but I found myself drawn to his surprisingly understated (though impossibly hunky) NGO-veteran hero. The pace of the movie's first two thirds was intense, and intelligently built on the audience's familiarity with the conventions of earlier zombie epics. I also liked how all the characters responded to the crisis believably -- while the mobs around them panicked, the main players made methodical, rational choices, and their reactions seemed to ring true.<br /><br />The frantic pace of the movie's start and its terrorism allegories gave way to a slower-paced, pleasantly surprising and anti-climactic third act, which settled back into a more conventional zombies-as-public-health narrative... I'm sure a lot of the negative reviews here an elsewhere have to do with the relative lack of gristle and graphic mayhem, which fans weaned on the bone-chewing gore of \\"The Walking Dead\\" will consider a shortcoming. But there's room for all kinds of zombie flicks, and this one had a nice, epic scope, along with an admittedly soft \\"Hollywood ending.\\" This didn't ruin it for me, although I can see where other folks are coming from. It's a thrilling blockbuster, though, and definitely worth watching. Grrr. Argh. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue movie reviews)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had been told by a family member about thus series and I have been watch 1-3 episodes a day. IT is very well done and I find myself ruting for many of the characters and upset at the same time. I am looking forward to watching series 4.

B0082RHRHC|3.0|Just liked it get flow ...seemed a little slow at some points but might read again sometime I am done
B008SLEX1U|5.0|Pictures were good.  There was just enough information provided to keep my grandchild interested without losing his attention.  Good book
B0000AUHQT|5.0|Loved the movie and the times.......so much better than the latest one out.......it was more realistic of the times. Excellent
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I ripped through this \\"meta-novel\\" in no time flat. For characters on a badly written show, I felt highly connected to them. Their loss, their fears and the feeling of being a part of something greater all struck a chord. Highly recommended.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Contained a lot of medical terms.  I couldn't help but wonder why a neurosurgeon would wait so long before seeking medical help, since he was obviously in so much pain.  Of course, I can understand that his thinking processes would be impaired!

B00006AUIG|5.0|This is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.  I luv it.  I bought one for my niece also.
098478280X|5.0|I started using this book as a study guide a few months ago to help me prepare for an interview with my dream company. The first time that I interviewed with this company a few years ago, I lacked a good plan that I could use to guide my efforts. I ended up studying up more on brain teasers than on the technical questions that really deserved my focus. Ultimately, I failed the tech screening process and was devastated.<br /><br />This time around, however, I decided to use a different approach by reading through \\"Cracking The Coding Interview\\". It helped me to craft a plan that was specifically tailored to my desired company. After studying one to two problems a day for a couple of months, I became very comfortable with the process of analyzing a situation and coming up with optimal solutions in a short amount of time. A lot of the fear and apprehension I once encountered when facing technical questions faded away as I practiced the problem solving techniques I learned from Gayle's writing.<br /><br />In the end, I got the offer and am super excited to finally see my dream come true. I know that I wouldn't have been able to do as well as I did without this book.

B009LMTDL0|3.0|After reading the book, I think Sheryl Sandberg is a talented and very decent person, and someone who I would not mind working for.  I think with all her connections and experiences she will become a CEO someday and I would invest in her company.<br /><br />There is very little amount of unique information in this book and might not be worth the price of purchasing it unless if you are new to reading business books.  The book is so heavily referenced, anyone who is an avid reader of current business books probably already know much of the content.<br /><br />One issue I have is Sheryl comes off as very non relateble.  That is the average person will not be in her social circle.  And not knowing her personally, I could easily be wrong, but that is how she comes across in this book.  She has hobnobbed with just about everyone who is important today, we get that.  Most CEO's and executives have.  But when you read their books, you hardly notice it.  Sandberg's seems to go through great efforts to name-drop perhaps too much and it adds risk of displacing the reader.<br /><br />Her Chapter about mentoring could have been drilled-down to one sentence, \\"If I mentor anyone -  I will chose you\\".  Sorry for the harshness, but that was the message I got from that chapter.  She doesn't come off as that mean, but you get the point.  The chapter could have been cut and her editors did a disservice by keeping it in,  IMO.<br /><br />The rest is stuff you've seen already, such as in TedTalks etc.  Which is a good thing and credit for her cause.<br /><br />Maybe three stars is too much?
B00A285OOW|4.0|I think it interesting to made her in love with Richard III, so diametrally opposed to Shakespeare view of the facts, and a powerless and unhappy queen. I also read &#34;the Lady of the Rivers&#34;, &#34;The White Queen&#34;, &#34;the Red Queen&#34;, &#34;The Kingsmaker's daughter&#34; and &#34;the constant princess&#34;. I prefer the two first ones.

B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book is just what I needed!  Just finished a good book(I read a lot!) and saw something on twitter about this book.  I had downloaded a few months ago and had forgotten it was on my iPad.  When I searched my library there it was, so I started it and finished the next day!  It has everything!  Funny, sexy, drama and the list goes on.  Loved the story being told from the male POV.  Excited to see more about Drew and Kate in the pipeline in the future.  A must read book!

I truly enjoyed this book as a refresher to everything I have learned through my pursuits as an entrepreneur. It has helped refocus my work flow and I will be returning to this book for quick re-reads to help solve future problems.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|QUICK UPDATE - 10/11/13 - Sony Pictures recently announced that this Blu-Ray and DVD set will include a 3-minute alternate ending, and also the making of this alternate ending. I won't write my guess here (don't want to spoil it for those who haven't watched the series yet), but for those who have watched the series, I'm sure you know what that ending is likely to be. I'm very curios to see how they play it out in the alternate ending!<br /><br />---<br /><br />I just finished binge-watching Breaking Bad and I have to say this show is perhaps the finest show I have ever seen. All credit goes to Vince Gilligan for his brilliant writing and narration, and the outstanding cast that has portrayed the characters so well.<br /><br />If you think about it, the show is fairly low key in terms of its canvas and sets (the other end of this spectrum would be the opulent Game of Thrones where HBO has spared no expense - I'm a big fan of that show as well). The strength of Breaking Bad is its simplistic sets, gripping and powerful pace and narration, and brilliant acting. These factors are what make the show an absolute delight to watch.<br /><br />NO SPOILERS really - The story is about a simple Albuquerque-based Chemistry professor, Walter White, who has perhaps had subdued resentment all his life as his colleagues have passed him by to more success and money than he was able to achieve. He was Mr. Nice Guy who avoided conflict, played by the book, loved his family, and was very much the guy next door. In part, he was satisfied with his simple life at home and at work, but subconsciously he always knew he was capable of much more and felt the world unfairly passed him by. Diagnosed with stage three lung cancer, he figures he has little to lose, and wants to make sure he provides for his family before his departure. This desperation triggers a whirlwind of events as he goes on to become a master chef of the best quality meth in the southwest, perhaps the entire country.<br /><br />The narration beautifully walks through the changing phases and personalities of Walt. From wanting to cook meth because he wants to leave enough money behind for his family, to eventually doing so because he was having fun doing it, Walt goes through various shades of transformation. Towards the darkest parts of season 6, you almost feel like the guy has completely lost it. Yet, strangely you will find yourself rooting for Walt, I guess partly because his nice family guy image stays with you throughout (I mean he leaves his house every morning to cook meth carrying a lunch bag with his name written on it!). The various battles in his mind, at his home, at work, are all very well acted out and directed.<br /><br />Kudos to Bryan Cranston for playing Walter White so brilliantly, he just owns this role. I cannot think of any other actor who could have portrayed Walt so well. Aaron Paul, playing Jesse - Walt's tormented partner in crime (for the most part), is pure Genius with a capital G. If you want to truly see his brilliant acting, check out two scenes in particular - one is I think in season 4, when he has a nervous breakdown in front of Walt after finding out he has to accompany Gus to Mexico, and the second is when he's basically having a one-sided conversation at dinner with Skyler and Walt. Again, pure Genius! My other favorite characters are Hank Schrader, played brilliantly by Dean Norris (he has a slight Jack Nicholson thing going...I think), and the sleazy but brilliant lawyer Saul Goodman played by Bob Odenkirk (they actually have a site bettercallsaul.com - check it out to see how sleazy he comes across). No amount of praise is high enough for the entire cast of this show.<br /><br />A few of my favorite quotes:<br /><br />\\"I am not in danger Skyler, I am the danger.\\" - Walter White<br /><br />Jesse - \\"Got some big cow house that way...\\". Walt - \\"Cow House?\\". Jesse - \\"Yeah, where they live......the cows\\"<br /><br />\\"Just because you shot Jesse James,don't make you Jesse James\\" - Mike Ehrmantraut<br /><br />\\"You are not the guy. You're not capable of being the guy. I had a guy, but now I don't. You are not the guy.\\" - Mike Ehrmantraut<br /><br />\\"Someone has to protect this family from the man who protects this family.\\" - Skyler White<br /><br />\\"You asked me if I was in the meth business or the money business. Neither. I'm in the empire business.\\" - Walter White<br /><br />The whole Star Trek teleporting discussion between Badger and Skinny Pete - I thought that was hilarious!<br />There are a few other great ones but not appropriate to be written here...yup, the jewels from Jesse.<br /><br />If you just want to watch the show, you can watch it on Netflix or Amazon Instant Video for a fraction of the price of this Blu-Ray set. That being said, this set makes an awesome gift and is truly a collector's item with all the extras that it comes with - special features, letter from Vince Gilligan, replica barrel (no money in it I'm sure!), Los Pollos Hermanos apron, 2-hour documentary, etc.<br /><br />Overall this is one of the best shows I have watched and I very highly recommend it to all - and btw, don't forget bacon and eggs on your next birthday!don't make you Jesse James\\" - Mike Ehrmantraut<br /><br />\\"You are not the guy.

B00FOF8W8I|5.0|The Rekindled Affair is a very short read that was witty and charming.<br /><br /> By Author Peter John who is quickly becoming a favorite author of mine, I find his books refreshing and always great for a laugh.<br /><br /> This book has a wonderful story line with charm and humor. A couple reunited after 45 years comes together for a date night. Not like your usual young couples in love, these two have matured and what follows is a fun read!<br /><br /> 5 stars for this book of \\"The Rekindled Affair\\" and of a Rekindled Love.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book is the type of book you cannot but down. Though it is about 1000 pages long there is always action and each character is amazing. The plot is great and every chapter leaves the reader wanting more. Overall Sanderson is a great author and this novel will rival other epic fantasy novels.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This CD came in better condition than advertised.  I am completely happy with my service to get one of the best albums from one of the best bands ever. David Lee Roth was king!  Van HAGAR was always just a diappointment.

0131988425|4.0|I had to buy this article as mandatory textbook for a Digital Signal Processing graduate course. It is definitely a complete and deep treatment of digital signal processing. However, I found it a little bit difficult to read and this is why I used it mainly to try to understand those concepts that were not clear to me from the lectures/notes. So far, the book gave me all the answers I needed.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My daughter and I share a library and she bought this book.  She read it and loved it.  I resisted because I figured it would be interesting to young people.  I found myself with 4 new books coming out the end of the month and nothing left to read except this one.  I started this book and within 10 minutes I was hooked.  It deserves all the praise it received.  I enjoyed every single word.  And read this trilogy in my spare time in 3 days.  So yes, I love this book.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|A sci-fi adventure void of excitement and personality, After Earth takes an interesting idea and turns it into a meandering, plodding drip of a movie.<br /><br />M. Night Shyamalan once made great films. The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs were unique genre movies that benefited from Shyamalan's creative approach to story and direction. Several turkeys later and the once critic's darling has become a gun for hire, with After Earth his latest gig. That his once popular name does not appear on any of the promo material indicates the dire professional straits Shyamalan has found himself in.<br /><br />The names that are front and centre belong to Will Smith and his son Jaden. They (of course) play father and son General Cypher Riage and Kitai Raige, respectively, inhabitants of a distant planet colonised by humans, who find themselves in a race for survival after a mid-space journey leads to a crash landing on an Earth that has evolved into a much dangerous place a millennium after mankind left it. Being a Shyamlan film of course there is more plot featured, yet such exposition was dizzying enough in the film so no need to repeat it here.<br /><br />A case of \\"too much info\\" is the least of the problems which plague After Earth, a bland sci-fi adventure that literally begins with a crash and never recovers. With a meandering script (courtesy of Shyamalan and Gary Wittia) as its guide, After Earth plodders from one scenario to another as hot-headed Kitai journeys through treacherous land to find an emergency beacon, while his heroic yet emotionally stunted father is sidelined with a gruesome injury that could be fatal. Despite working with two tense filled scenarios, Shyamalan fails to make either effectively engrossing in any way.<br /><br />A big problem is the performances, with the Smith duo unable to make these characters, their scenario or their relationship worth investing in. Jaden Smith is just too green to pull of such a demanding lead role, with Kitai the engine that should have made After Earth run smoothly instead of spluttering along like the lemon it is. In turn Kitai becomes an intensely unlikeable character who cannot get the audience on side.<br /><br />Just as bad is big \\"Willie\\" Smith, who delivers a flaccid performance bereft of that charisma that benefits most of his movies, replaced here with a clenched jaw intensity that becomes stale, fast. It is ironic that a film about a son following the legacy of his father has seen the Smith family shoot themselves in the foot in their second outing as a collective (matriarch Jada Pinkett Smith joins her husband as a producer).<br /><br />Worst is the body blow given to Shyamalan's career with yet another stinker. There is still talent there to be sure with some moments of tension creeping through After Earth now and again, yet a new approach is needed by Shyamalan to recapture former glories.<br /><br />The first step should be to align himself with a screenwriter - perhaps a Damon Lindelof (Star Trek) or Jonatahon Nolan (The Dark Knight Rises) - who can take his million dollar ideas and shape it into something worth watching. The second? Stay away from vain family projects that are sure to leave egg on your face.<br /><br />[...]engine that should have made After Earth run smoothly instead of spluttering along like the lemon it is.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a great game until you run out of energy.  It's fun and easy to play.  You can own more than one horse.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Amazing how a young person can endure so much and still have a wonderful positive outlook on life.<br />I thought the book would be depressing - and even though the story is so very sad - that Jaycee could still become such an amazing person is wonderful.
B003VANOFY|3.0|The good stuff<br />- The mic has an auto-mute feature when you swivel it up<br />- The range is decent (40 ft, can't go as far as my cordless phone but I understand the technology is different)<br />- Solid construction<br />- 10 hour battery life<br /><br />The bad stuff<br />- Not true 7.1.  I expected the center speaker would be emulated but it turns out this headset only has one speaker for each ear and emulates all channels.<br />- The bass doesn't have much punch.<br />- The power button is finicky for turning off the headset.  Hold it down too long or not long enough and the headset thinks you accidentally pressed the button and doesn't shut off.  The manual says \\"2 seconds\\".  I have found the sweet spot between 3 and 4 seconds.<br />- The \\"sidetone\\" setting resets after turning off the headset and the headset forgets to use it after a few minutes of talking.  This feature allows you to hear your own voice in the speakers so that you don't constantly shout at the other person.  However, after a while I will stop hearing my own voice, look at the configuration, and see that the volume has been reset to 0.  Perhaps there is something I don't have set up right but the configuration app seems pretty straight-forward.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a bad headset but I expected more quality for the price.  The two-speaker emulation is the biggest turn-off.  I will be looking for a replacement headset and hand this one to my son.
0385743564|4.0|This is a fun book to read but it's, frankly, a little below the level of world-building and nuanced character development that I'm used to with Brandon Sanderson.  I'd certainly recommend the book to anyone, but just know going in that it won't even hold a candle to The Stormlight Archive or Mistborn series.  This book is also much more predictable than maybe any other Brandon Sanderson book I've read (and I've read nearly all of them).  There are a still some nice twists in the story like in all of his books, but many of them are a just little easier to foresee than usual.<br /><br />To be fair, I think this series might be intended for a slightly younger audience than either of his two epic series mentioned above, so maybe it's not really an apples to apples comparison.<br /><br />Either way, this book will please both seasoned Brandon Sanderson fans and first-time readers alike...  Just don't expect it to match up with his more adult books and epic series.

B00EP0KBXM|2.0|I been a big sci-fI person all my life, but not sure that high tech makes a movie any more, for one thing Will Smith should stay from writing stories or at least get a book on it.  It got more than one star because I sit though the entire movie.  But I did look it up on my iPad -  but I had to be fair and see it all before I wrote this.<br /><br />Well actually thought of not even watching, when I saw preview for \\"White House Down\\"<br /><br />Well Sony may make good TV's but they need to go back to school in making movies.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A great read in the usual fast paced Stephen King style. Tying the old with the new was believable and worked for me. A page turner as every S.K. Novel is. Was worried that the ending might be abrupt and out of left field but was pleasantly surprised. Sadly now,... I need another book
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Best show on TV. Cast is excellent. Has good writers and the show keeps you envolved. The acting is great.

I had forgotten how funny Prachett is, something for which I have no excuse at all.<br />Warning -- whatever you may think, you are NOT getting all the jokes.

B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Being a AB fan I was wondering how this album was gonna turn out to be, since Myles is juggling between AB & Slash. and Mark Tremonti who is doing his own thing and also Creed. But man when I heard the opening track, i kept going back to the start of the song every time the song ended, l would restart it. I was already addicted to the first single from the album. Last year Tremonti's solo album took me by surprise and this year this is my fav album. I am not a fan of comparing the bands new album to the last album, so no point doing that. The Album has been on repeat since I got it and before that I had been streaming it. Mark Tremonti is just an awesome guitarist/riff master. Myles is as awesome as usual, glad that Mark Tremonti has had a chance to sing on \\"water Rising\\". Brian Marshall and Scott Phillips are tight on Bass and Drums as usual. Alter Bridge ROCKS
B009AMANBA|5.0|Great stars...great education.  Goes a little slow because it's trying to portray actual events.  Definitely gives a different view of Lincoln.

B00DFFI7K2|4.0|Was disappointed that the main character of the first movie was bumped out by killing him off so Dwayne Johnson could<br />take his place.  Putting Bruce Willis in was a good come back for that move, and that is why I gave it a 4 star.  The action<br />was a little disappointing, however again ---- Bruce Willis to the rescue with his back seat comments.  Dwayne Johnson<br />is an okay actor.  I feel there was a lot of wrestling idiom in his acting that took away from who the character really was<br />supposed to be.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|A lot of people on the Appstore have noticed by now that there aren't very many &quot;good&quot; app's out there, and they're dead right. Draw a stick man epic is one of those few that has so much adventure and fun that, even if you've beat the level, you'll still find yourself playing it again just to see what you might have missed. So whether it's free or paid, this game is worth every penny.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|The first movie was good as was this one.  The action was great---it always is with this actor.<br />The story was exciting and comical at times.  Diversity that kept interest and thrill of adventure.

0375842209|4.0|This is a very very strange book.  The narrator is the grim reaper.<br />As though that is not strange enough, at the beginning of every chapter,<br />we are told, in bold print, everything that will happen in the following pages.<br />Before the characters in this story \\"pass on\\" we have read the headlines.<br />We know what is coming.  BUT, surprisingly this reader continued to<br />read on anxiously. The announcement did not ruin anything.<br />The setting is nazi Germany, during the worst of the war years<br /> The main character is an orphaned German girl.<br />She finds happiness with her foster family, with books and<br /> with her good friend, Rudy. I was surprised to read that some reviewers<br /> found the book boring.  No way!  I found the writing realistic and readable.<br />I liked this book and I do recommend it.  Don't be put off by the weird<br />format.  Stick with the book and you will soon be hooked.

B00FEN000S|5.0|The story is roughly Robotech vs Godzilla-and-his-friends off the coast of China. I watched this movie for the magnificent robots. The giant monsters were great, too. They were Pan's Labyrinth-esque in their hideousness. Genuinely scary. The wee little people piloting the robots were just interesting enough to hold the plot together. The beautiful but haunted Mako is alluring and vengeful at the same time. But who needs plot when you've got a whole cornucopia of progressively more gripping and majestic robot on monster battles? The only negative here is that I couldn't enjoy this movie with my little boys. They would have had nightmares for the next month. I'm hoping for a Pacific Rim 2: Bigger Robots, Badder Monsters.

Based on exhaustive research, and without in any way denigrating or advocating Christian belief, the author placed the whole story about the origins of Christianity and its initial relationship to Judaism in perspective.

0553296981|5.0|Enter Anne Frank's brave new world  -- the world of Kitty, Peter, Anne's favorite pen, dancing and ballet, and yes, even the German SS, and final betrayal.  It's been with us now nearly 70 years, immortalized in diary notes found scattered on the floor of her family's hiding place in Amsterdam after their arrest. A source of healing for nearly four generations since its publication in 1947, \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" records the coming of age of a gifted precocious teenager of 14 becoming a young woman,  fiercely honest and lucid and aware nearly all the time and therefore able to vividly recreate on diary page after delightful diary page her celebration of the joy of living.<br /><br />70 years with us? So what's so new about it? What point could this reviewer possibly be making that hasn't been made before -- and perhaps even  better?  This: To the growing number of men and women denying the Holocaust ever happened,  \\"The Diary\\" is a stark and poignant reminder that it did happen, that Anne, her sister Margot, and their mother were three of its millions of victims.<br /><br />Every generation must revisit the world of Anne Frank on its own terms, with its own vision. Being more or less the fourth generation after Anne, it's our turn:  In a parallel universe half a globe away from her world, in the Bronx, NY, more or less 16 years before Anne began recording her diary entries,  a 4-year old boy runs upstairs to his mother cooking  in the kitchen, looks up into her face asking: \\"What am I?\\" Years later, the boy a brilliant retired engineer  by now recalled: \\" Mother said that I was a good boy [and continued working].  I repeated the question and she replied that I was a very good boy.\\"<br /><br />\\"My next query was - Am I Italian?  My mother then said - So that is what this is all about.  No, you are not Italian.  You are a Jew.\\"<br /><br />\\"With that response, I ran down the stairs and with a loud voice I echoed \\"I am a Jew\\", \\"I am a Jew\\" all the way to the building's front steps and onto the street, where many neighborhood kids were gathered.  One of the older boys, who may have been six or seven years old said - in an equally loud voice - OK Jew - get the ball - you're holding up the game.\\"<br /><br />Anne Frank's \\"Diary\\" and Saul's \\"Vignettes\\", experienced half a globe apart, parallel and complete each other. Same generation. Anne died in the Belsen concentration camp, on the eve of being liberated. Saul grew up and fought in World War II trying to liberate her and others.<br /><br />For the rest of this remarkable connection read \\"The Diary\\", then download and read a Kindle edition of \\"Vignettes: The Story of My Life\\" by Saul Frechtel at http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=VIGNETTES+saul+frechtel.'s front steps and onto the street, where many neighborhood kids were gathered.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read The Shining when it first came out and I was 17 years old.  I was surprised how much I remembered of it.  There are slight references in Doctor Sleep back to The Shining, that I was able to pick up on.  With Stephen King books I either love them or I am disappointed in them.  I don't read everything he writes but I have read quite a bit.  This book falls definitely falls in the love category.
B00DL2W7Q4|2.0|&#34;Tipping Point&#34; was very interesting  and often contrapuntally insightful; So was &#34;Outliers&#34;. And the reason was that Gladwell took an important thesis, and  very successfully focussed relevant anecdotal evidence and stories in support of the thesis.<br />  The thesis of this book is similarly important, well-chosen, and potentially gripping. However, most of the personal stories chosen are off the mark, and not focussed, ( although sometimes interesting.)  The editor here was not doing his job, and a pity. Or is this a case of a famous author who has done so well, not willing to take an editor's criticism, and produces a slap-dash, light-weight, unthought-out book. V'haval!

(love that extra carry capacity!)<br /><br />If you really need a pound of steel in the wilderness this knife cannot be beat for the money.<br /><br />Otherwise, there are a lot of good smaller/lighter choices out there and I prefer them- the only reason I give it a 4 star instead of 5 star rating.

B00000DHTF|5.0|As one of the most prolific artists of the last 40 years, Bruce Springsteen has released some of the most beloved rock classics ever. However, beyond his impressive officially released catalog lies a world of undiscovered gems that never saw the light due to either poor judgment or simply not fitting the artistic vision The Boss was going for at the time. Some of these became B-sides and some were even performed live without official release, but many simply remained lost to the sands of time until the 1998 boxed set \\"Tracks.\\"<br /><br />\\"Tracks\\" barely scrapes the surface as far as the many great previously unreleased Springsteen recordings go, but it does a perfectly credible job of collecting some of the best, beginning with his four song audition for John Hammond at Columbia Records in 1972.<br /><br />The first disc covers 1972-1978. Not every song is a winner, and some are particularly terrible (\\"Bishop Danced,\\" \\"Zero and Blind Terry\\"), but songs \\"Seaside Bar Song,\\" \\"Rendezvous,\\" \\"Bring on the Night,\\" \\"Hearts of Stone,\\" and \\"Don't Look Back\\" are as good as anything he ever put on an official album and stack up well against the rest of his catalog.<br /><br />Disc 2 covers 1979-82 and is easily the best of the four, covering \\"The River\\" through the early \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" sessions. Much has been made of how badly Bruce dropped the ball when selecting what went onto \\"The River,\\" and this disc really hammers that home: letting great pop songs like \\"Roulette,\\" \\"Where the Bands Are,\\" \\"Loose Ends,\\" \\"Take `Em as They Come,\\" and \\"Be True\\" go in favor of lesser fare like \\"Two Hearts,\\" \\"Crush on You,\\" \\"I'm a Rocker\\" truly hurt the record in terms of quality. Other treats here include an alternate \\"Stolen Car\\" (not as sparse or as haunting as the released take but effective in its own right) and a chilling early cut of \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" that drives the actual meaning of the lyrics home more effectively than the anthemic (and great in its own right) album version. In addition to the wealth of truly great songs on here, the cd itself is the best sounding release of Springsteen's career; no other cd, studio or live, sounds as crisp and clear and leaps out of the speakers like a wild jackal.<br /><br />Disc 3 contains great cuts like \\"My Love Will Not Let You Down,\\" the thrilling \\"Stand On It,\\" and the popular \\"Pink Cadillac,\\" but loses steam towards the end with forgettable fare like \\"When You Need Me,\\" \\"Two for the Road,\\" and \\"The Honeymooners,\\" though it does contain the touching Mother's Day ballad \\"The Wish.\\"<br /><br />Disc 4 gets some heat from fans because it draw from the period where he disbanded the E Street Band, but the majority of the material is surprisingly strong. \\"Seven Angels\\" is a terrific rocker, while \\"Sad Eyes\\" is a tender ballad with a moving, sympathetic vocal from Bruce. \\"Loose Change\\" is one of his most haunting songs, while \\"Part Man, Part Monkey\\" is dumb but very funny. \\"Happy\\" is in the running for the best love song he ever wrote. The two best moments come from the two cuts at the end, the achingly soulful \\"Back in Your Arms\\" and the haunting \\"Brothers Under the Bridge,\\" one of Bruce's quintessential Vietnam ballads.<br /><br />\\"Tracks\\" isn't perfect (a follow-up is most certainly needed), but is a solid sampling of some of Bruce's best songs that got awayn addition to the wealth of truly great songs on here, the cd itself is the best sounding release of Springsteen's career; no other cd, studio or live, sounds as crisp and clear and leaps out of the speakers like a wild jackal.<br /><br />Disc 3 contains great cuts like \\"My Love Will Not Let You Down,\\" the thrilling \\"Stand On It,\\" and the popular \\"Pink Cadillac,\\" but loses steam towards the end with forgettable fare like \\"When You Need Me,\\" \\"Two for the Road,\\" and \\"The Honeymooners,\\" though it does contain the touching Mother's Day ballad \\"The Wish.\\"<br /><br />Disc 4 gets some heat from fans because it draw from the period where he disbanded the E Street Band, but the majority of the material is surprisingly strong. \\"Seven Angels\\" is a terrific rocker, while \\"Sad Eyes\\" is a tender ballad with a moving, sympathetic vocal from Bruce. \\"Loose Change\\" is one of his most haunting songs, while \\"Part Man, Part Monkey\\" is dumb but very funny. \\"Happy\\" is in the running for the best love song he ever wrote.

And not the \\"new\\" style of outlandish CGI action that is so prevalent and over the top in much of the movie fare of today.<br />The Fugitive features a much more raw and genuine type of action - a style that is iconic from several 80's and 90's films.<br /><br />5 stars!<br /><br />This is a classic and I have enjoyed watching it several times.<br /><br />NOTE: Some might find this film intense in some scenes.

1439102813|3.0|\\"Still Alice\\" was an incredibly heart breaking story of not just a woman declining through Alzheimer's, but an entire family's journey. The story starts out showing how successful Alice Howland is. She is a Harvard professor, has a PhD, 3 grown children and a happy marriage. Slowly things start to change. Over the next two years, we see how this degenerative disease takes over the lives of Alice and her family.<br /><br />There were parts of the story that had me smiling because they are everyday things that could happen to anyone. Other parts had me tearing up. And then there were the parts that made me fearful for the future, and glad that I don't have this disease running through my family. This book gave me a look into the lives of the families that have this disease as a reality. They have my sympathy for what they have to go through, but more than that, they should be held in the highest of esteem and viewed with the utmost of respect.<br /><br />I read along while listening to the \\"Still Alice\\" audio book. It took a long time for me to get used to the Author's voice. I don't think that she was the right person to read the book. Alice was a 50-something. Lisa's (the author) voice reminded me of a 20-something party girl. It may have been the East Coast accent that made me think part of this, but she is definitely younger than the character of Alice, which really threw me off. Also, there wasn't much differentiation between the character voices. I couldn't tell if Alice was the one speaking, or her husband, John.  I highly recommend this book, but would suggest readers grab the book rather than the audiobook.

0385528787|3.0|I was a huge fan of \\"Oryx and Crake\\", loved \\"Year of the Flood\\" as well, and was constantly checking to see when the third installment in the trilogy would be published.  Having read it, I have to agree with those who feel that \\"MaddAddam\\" is not in the same league as the first two books. I appreciate Atwood's playful technique of folding stories within stories and telling different versions the same incident.  Zeb's back story, which occupies a large portion of the novel, is ribald and picaresque and harrowing, just as it should be... but the present-tense post-apocalyptic story feels flaccid by comparison. I always enjoy this author's wild imagination and her satiric sense of humor. The Crakers are certainly much funnier than the Eloi in HG Well's \\"The Time Machine\\"... to whom they bear some resemblance... with the Painballers as an update of the Morlocks...but, as plotlines go, the Zeb/Toby love story and the quest to locate Adam One just don't deliver the goods.

B002VUFKG6|5.0|I loved seeing Liz come from Eat Pray Love to becoming a married woman. She weaves in history, facts and quotes about love and commitment with her own love story in a way that reads like the best textbook ever except the word textbook is horrendous. Her struggle to come to terms with marriage is admirable and makes you wish more people agonized of this most important decision. Loved it and look forward to reading more Gilbert stories.

Not saying that is terrible, but from all the reviews and the number of people who actually have this app, I expected something extraordinary. It just sort of disappointed me a bit that the game is just ordinary.

B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|Movies I love include \\"A Haunting in Connecticut\\", the 2005 \\"Amityville House\\", and \\"Dead Silence\\" so if you hated those, you might not like The Conjuring.<br /><br />I loved the feel of this movie, it actually feels like the classic creepy, supernatural, haunting horror movies I remember from the 90's (Before the genre committed suicide). After becoming numb to the mindless \\"found footage\\", \\"crazy serial killer\\" and  \\"teen scream\\" horrors I'm excited that Hollywood is giving tradition another chance. The acting and script are awesome, cinematography perfect.<br /><br />Bear in mind, I can only name 3 horror movies I love, The Conjuring has joined the list. For all those who hated it because it wasn't scary or the scares were predictable, after watching as many horror movies as I have you realize nothing is original and nothing creeps you out anymore. But for normal people who aren't obsessed with Supernatural Horrors as I am, The Conjuring is extremely entertaining. For horror buffs like myself, its worth a watch.<br /><br />Just a random fact,  although the case depicted in this film was one of the scariest Lorraine Warren (the psychic who the lead character is based on) ever investigated, she still maintains that the Amityville house is the one case she hopes to never revisit.<br /><br />o0 Makes you wonder what's in Amityville. 0o

1469298872|5.0|Funny, engaging and poignant, Redshirts is a highly enjoyable read. It's full of inside jokes for Star Trek fans, but not so much that it will alienate people who only have passing knowledge of the Trek universe. Still, I think best suited to folks at least somewhat familiar with Star Trek. I listened to the audiobook read by Wil Wheaton, who is a really fantastic narrator, and a fun choice for a book parodying his franchise.

The graphics were phenomenal and contrary to what the people who are complaining about how they hated the rap, I purchased the soundtrack on ITunes. People are more stuck on the fact that there was rap in the movie than focused on the fact that this is true Lurhmans style. You're either going to love it or hate it. Come into it without expectations and you will enjoy it.

1582701709|1.0|Summary: If you consistently believe you're rich, feel like you're rich, and act like you're rich, you'll become rich. Not figuratively, but with real money.<br />The same goes for good health, true love, and anything else you can imagine (nothing's impossible).<br /><br />If anything bad happens to you, it's because your negative thoughts attracted it.<br /><br />This is because of the 'Law of Attraction' as postulated by Plato... which the author contends is a law of nature, like gravity... despite a complete and total lack of clarity, scientific rigor, or testing. But supposedly all the really great dead famous people totally lived by it, because they maybe mention 'like attracting like' somewhere.<br /><br />So you don't have to feel bad for sick for poor people because it's totally their fault because of their mindset. And if you feel bad for them, it will attract bad things into your life. Even if they're someone close to you that you love. Even if they die. You should just think good, happy, confident, peaceful thoughts, like Donald Trump does  when he thinks about money. Apparently, he's all positive and zen.<br /><br />Hey, I agree that a positive attitude and imagining a good outcome are very important. But this is just silly, and frankly, irresponsible.
1401201911|5.0|One of my favorite story lines in comic history. What if Superman wasn't &#34;American&#34;? The story was awesome, and I've recommended this to both comic lovers and people who have never read a comic.<br />Also, I thought it was awesome when Injustice came out and used Red Son characters as special versions of Superman, Wonder Woman, etc.
B004EPZ084|2.0|A \\"Comedy\\" about three guys who hate their bosses and try to kill them. A lot of cursing in the movie, which unfortunately detracts from the \\"Comedy\\". The potential for a good movie was here, with plenty of good actors, but I thought it fell short. I did get a chuckle or two out of some of the lines, but for the most part this just wasn't my \\"cup of tea\\".<br /><br />Sorry, but this one is getting donated to someone else or tossed in the trash.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I bought this and a Blu-ray player for my mother for Christmas, and she absolutely loved it. The quality of the movie was amazing, and she said the best she'd seen period. The soundtrack was fun to have, and overall this was a great package. I doubt I would have every paid the retail price for it, I got it for somewhere around $30 or $40.

B00CIVLZ3U|5.0|Sanderson's done it again. I think that those who enjoy his fantasy epics will not be disappointed by this book.
B00F9040HU|2.0|I think I would love it....if it was really a &quot;FREE&quot; game.  There is no excuse for lying....especially if you lie to make money.
B00E3BK0QQ|1.0|Game is good slot of stories and places to look for things I am enjoying it so far wishing for a part 2

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I've had to do so many math assignments and this has helped me through allot of them including a 350 problem math assignment
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I know many people had very high expectations for this one. It is, after all, a sequel to one of King's masterworks, THE SHINING. However, I urge readers to come to DOCTOR SLEEP with no expectations. In the end, for me, the book is a masterful work, more about battling and triumphing over our personal demons as opposed to the horror kind. King gives us here a grown-up and very flawed Danny from THE SHINING and takes us on a fascinating journey of redemption. The way King writes about addiction and its torments rings very true. The horror aspect of the story, too, was handled very well and originally. It was a masterstroke of brilliance on King's part to create a whole new breed of monsters as he has done here. They are terrifying and real. I highly recommend this one, both as a sequel and as a moving and thought-provoking standalone novel.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Loved it!! By far my most favourite book. Uglies is totally a book so captivating you can't put it down.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|After reading this series for 19 years, I am content with the ending. Thanks Brandon for giving us a good close!
B001EC3JME|4.0|It looks bulky when I clipped it on belt.  The plastic part takes up the space. It could be make thinner.
0887306128|5.0|Great Read!  Not only for business, but also for life.  As tru today as it was when it was written in 1966.
0913866156|5.0|I ordered these cards in two sizes, but I sent back the smaller deck (standard size) since I did not feel a connection to them. I thought they were too small to see all of the great detail that is included with these beautiful cards. When I first opened these cards, I felt a very strong connection to them. About 15 years ago I was dating someone who had these same cards, I used them and have not felt that connection since. The Thoth tarot are amazing cards, and their accuracy is astounding and no other cards I have used have that much accuracy. I am not sure why they are so accurate BUT THEY ARE. It amazes me each time. The cards themselves are bright, beautiful, filled with detail, have an amazing aura, and if you are a true intuitive tarot reader you will feel a connection to them immediately. The novice and the advanced readers can all benefit from this deck. For shuffling, I would recommend shuffling them the long way, so your hand goes across the short way, and the part being shuffled is the long part of the card.<br /><br />I would recommend this deck to anyone, and the LWB included is very detailed, almost to the point where someone does not need to buy a Thoth companion book.<br /><br />5 stars all the way. Favorite deck thus far, highly recommend.
B0028YPDVW|5.0|I did not purchase the Wolf as a toy; I'm a little past that age, although it would be great as a toy. I'm a collector and after visiting a wolf preserve in Minnesota this spring, decided to add a wolf to my collection.<br /><br />It is well detailed, sturdy and sits on my desk proudly. I am pleased!
B001TH16DI|5.0|Absolutely love them.  I am amazed at how clear & crisp the picture is.  For any fan of the series, these are a must have.

B000008M54|5.0|Timeless, I play this CD on my way to work every day.  I work out to Fisherman's Blue's which if you pace to every beat puts the pace very fast, coupled with the heart and soul in the song keeps me motivated.
1118232658|5.0|This was one of the first social media books I ever read, and that was 3 years ago and it still holds up today, even with all of the major changes within the industry.<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone who's ever been challenged on the merits of social media and needs a good argument for why companies need to put stronger resources behind this medium.  It's not a how-to book, it's a lessons learned book which makes it much easier to read.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. I also recommend going to youtube and searching for all of the Socialnomics clips, they are thoroughly informative and entertaining at the same time.<br /><br />If this helps, I have been working in branding and design for the past 4 years, read many social media book and this one is still my favourite.
140191716X|5.0|The beauty of the construction of the book draws you in first then the daily messages are perfect! Everyone I know is buying this now...and I'm giving it as gifts...Beautiful Book!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This is only getting one star because it won't accept zero.  I've played this version for a while now and used to love it.  It's free bingo, what's not to love?  PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING!  The game always freezes, is super slow, constantly doesn't apply credits when you win them.  I've dealt with these things for a long time and am finally throwing in the towel. Deleting this app right now!!!!
0988178532|5.0|Reading Brandt Legg's Outview is a fast paced, rollicking good time.  Although the prose is often thoughtful and the descriptions of the Oregon coast evocative, the story moves at an exhilaratingly furious clip.<br /><br />Nate, the protagonist, is a humble, self-deprecating teen who at first seems to be suffering from horrible nightmares and hallucinations.  He is an average kid battled by demons we the readers do not understand.  As we get to know Nate better, as well as the obstacles that beset him, Nate's unassuming nature becomes important as he picks up numerous psychic and new age powers.  Even as he sky climbs, astral travels and walks through portals he remains a character with whom the reader can identify and route for, as opposed to an inscrutable superhero.<br /><br />Outview takes readers places they may have not been before, or even imagined.  Past lives are revealed, along with the concept of forgiveness for past life transgressions.  Sacred groves are discovered as well as portals between both time and space.  Important thought is given to the nature of the soul itself, as a separate entity from the corporal body.  Mystics also appear throughout the book, providing guidance and knowledge for the main character as he struggles to put meaning to the events swirling around him.<br /><br />Based on the age of the majority of the main characters Outview seems to be a book aimed at the teenage market.  As such, it does an admirable job of introducing some fascinating new age concepts in an unthreatening way.  On the other hand, Outview stands on it's own as a adventuresome work of fiction with appeal to all ages.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game is very fun but it needs more levels. It is also a very creative game because it makes you think of solutions to get out of the rooms.
B001AOKA3W|4.0|I first watched Cloverfield on my 63\\" plasma and infinity 7+ 5.1\\"surround system.  Amazing!  A couple of nites ago I watched it in my truck on a 24\\" LED screen without surround and it was just average.  So I reran it on my home theatre tonite and it was just as amazing as the first time.  So much so that I had to type this review right after it.  Cloverfield needs a good home or movie theatre environment to bring out the full experience.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  Hidden object games are my favorite. Some can be pretty lame but I really would recommend this one.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Wonderful!  Makes that experience so real. Great acting and plot . . I had seen the dubbed version, but this original with subtitles is so much better,
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As usual King has written another great thriller, bringing back the memories of the Shining and a little boy who has grown  through tough times to become the mentor for a young girl whom out shines all.
630469654X|5.0|I'm replacing my VHS with DVD's and I couldn't find this one anywhere cheaper. This is a great romance story and I like it alot. Recommand to anyone who doesn't like the newer more explicit romance stories.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  I play it on my phone and my kindle. Super fun, super easy to play
B001GUXJQA|5.0|This was a fast moving and I had a hard time putting it down. I have not read Michael Connelly before but will read more of his books
B007J4T2G8|4.0|First of all, remember... you are not reading Faulkner or Proust here. So, don't expect a monumental literary work. I say that up front b/c there is a lot of negative comments about the caliber of the writing and the superficiality of the story. To which I would like to respond: \\"Duh!\\" This is commercial fiction meant to entertain and provide a means of escape. It SHOULD be relaxing and not too taxing on the cerebrum.<br /><br />The only reason I read this book was b/c of all the hype. I've read very little erotica and, although I totally get it's utility, I have found it pretty ridiculous. So, I was doubtful that I could stand a full-length novel of the stuff.<br /><br />But, I would call this mainstream erotica or erotica for the non-erotica reader or, probably more apt, simply a romance novel with a little more hard core sex scenes. The sex scenes are probably a little too soft for the traditional erotica and a little too hard for the usual romance reader crowd.<br /><br />So... why the 4 stars when this isn't what I like to read? Because it was entertaining. I actually cared about what happened b/w Christian and Anastasia. I will actually buy the 2nd book. The characters weren't necessarily the most memorable and complex people you'd ever read about, but they were fleshed out enough that I wasn't bored. Also, there is a fairly long seduction process for the reader. Because of the hype, I already knew the relationship b/c Ana and Christian was supposed to be Dominant/Submissive with spankings etc. That's about all I knew. The author doesn't just fling you into that world. Like Ana, I guess we need some persuading. This is where, I think, James won over the masses. This is why this series is having mainstream success. You can believe that Ana would allow Christian to do what he does to her b/c she is taken there in a slow, step-wise fashion. And, like Ana, your excitement/anxiety/arousal about getting there builds through the book.<br /><br />What I don't like about the book? The same things I can't stand about the few romance novels I've read. Why does Christian have to be a millionaire? Are millionaires the only kind of men that can turn us on? Not only is he super rich... I don't think he is even 30 yet. Really? I'm rolling my eyes. And, of course, he's an accomplished pianist. Of course. And, of course, he's fluent in French. I'm getting nauseated. HOWEVER.... I let this slide b/c I think you can get past this cliche.<br /><br />Also, I echo the thoughts of another reviewer. Ana orgasms WAAAAYYY to easily. She was a virgin before Mr. Grey. She never even masturbated. This girl had never pleasured herself nor had an intimate relationship with a man to bring her close to orgasm. Yet, she orgasm with her first penetrative sexual experience in the capable hands of Christian Grey. I think the author could've been a little more realistic here and still made Mr. Grey out to be a sexual Jedi. But... like the multi-millionaire status thing... I'm letting it slide. I would've considered a 5 star, though, if the author made Christian middle class and made him work a little harder to make Ana cum. It would've made the story more tangible.<br /><br />Overall, this a good book that serves the purpose of entertaining the reader. Also, I think it might make you at least think about some of these sexual... how should I say this... accoutrements. Why not? I've been married for almost 18 years and, after reading this book, I had to ask my husband: \\"Do you ever think about spanking me?\\" LOL.<br /><br />Also, I have to say \\"Way to go!\\" to E L James. Good for you, girl. This book/series started off as an e book and then went to print-on-demand paperbacks. I love hearing those kind of success stories.

B00F35B8F8|5.0|Best star trek movie to date. You must rent this movie if you haven't seen it. Special effects are awesome and the plot riveting. New Khan is better than the old one. New spoke is more believable. I love Scottie's little alien sidekick.
B001DJLCRC|2.0|I was very unhappy with this dvd.  There are NO English subtitles (however, you can get subtitles in French, Spanish, Portuguese).  My husband has a hearing loss and needs closed captions.  We had to crank up the volume to full blast and I still had to tell him some of the dialogue.  The series itself it is great.  Our viewing experience was not.  Amazon should clearly state that English subtitles are not available (Amazon customer service confirmed this, so it's not the case that we didn't know how to work the settings.)

B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|I was really impressed by the range of this album.  The beats are awesome and each song warrants a second and third listen.  I would definitely recommend checking this album out to anyone who wants to listen to a fresh sound.  She is only 16 and listening to this album one would never think that.  Her voice is so mature and her songs are relatable in a unique way.  Also, for being so talented, her sound is not pretentious like a lot of artists which is also refreshing.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book eight years ago based on a friend suggestion and I loved it so much. The way it is written, the characters you connect with and grow to love. The ending of the book has a twist that just shocks you and leaves you with mixed feelings about what happens. I saw they were going to be making a movie from this book and wanted to relive the journey again because it was worth it.

I am going to have to read the book series.

B00DBISUWS|5.0|Without writing a thesis, I love how Goldfrapp is constantly changing their sound or modifying their sound. I like artists that refuse to be pinned down. Each disc is pure Goldfrapp.<br />The shift from Head First to this might be jarring, but if you have followed the evoluation of the band, this disc fits perfectly into their biography.  A must listen as the weather turns colder.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I'm hooked. This program will be considered a classic someday. I'm just glad that it's available on CD. There are so many twists and turns, you never know where it's going to go next.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The Aristototilian theory of tragedy required a hero that the audience invested in, so that the audience then personally felt the hero's downfall. Well written and well constructed as this novel is, there is nobody to like, to invest in. This bitter novel, a decline and fall of practically everybody, is quite unlike her other recent adult novel, \\"The Cuckoo's Calling\\", which had two central characters you immediately liked and invested in. In \\"The Casual Vacancy.\\" Rowling's well-crafted characters range from petty, egocentric, not-too bright through to truly evil. This may be an accurate portrait of the human condition but I would not call it a \\"fun read.\\" At the end of a satisfying novel, I feel a bit abandoned, as if friends have gone away. At the end of \\"The Casual Vacancy,\\" I was really glad to get out of Pagford.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This is a great movie with music, dancing, and unexpected love. I want to get up and dance and sing every time I watch it.
0385743564|5.0|Steelheart is a fantastic jaunt into the near-future world where Epics (people with super powers) have taken over and the average person's only hope is to avoid their notice and live in a place where the Epic in charge is willing to provide basic services for them. But there are a few who fight back - they're known as the Reckoners.<br /><br />In Steelheart we follow David - the newest member of the Reckoners - as he persuades the vigilante group to try and take back Newcago from it's ruling epic Steelheart. It's a fast-paced journey with twists and action that doesn't let up until you turn the last page.

Cuando lo comence a leer no queria parar de leerlo y poco a poco me puso a pensar sobre muchas cosas que uno como persona pasa en la vida, cosas malas, cosas buenas y cosas que en verdad no tienen sentido.. son esas cosas de la vida que nos llevan al camino al que uno tiene que estar, el camino al que ya fue escrito por nosotros. Me gusto tanto que compre 2 mas para mis hermanas.. Un libro que todos tenemos que Leer.
B004KA9VGA|5.0|I had been wanting to read this book for a while, and had it on my Wish List since last year.  I finally managed to get it as an audio book, and loved it!<br /><br />Diana Bishop is a fantastic character! She is a historian, and a witch.  I liked this character very much! She is extremely independent and feisty, but, when she discovers an alchemical manuscript that has been missing, she suddenly finds herself thrust into a dangerous world of witches, daemons and vampires, who will stop at nothing to possess the book.<br /><br />Matthew Clairmont is also a fascinating character.  He is a geneticist, who also happens to be a vampire.  He is an enigmatic person. I was unsure whether I liked him at first, but as the story unfolded, he won me over!  I loved his intensity and his determination.<br /><br />This story is told from mostly Diana's point of view, but Matthew also has his say, which I found extremely interesting, as it showed their thoughts and feelings. I usually struggle to get into a story when it's on audio book, but I had no such issues with this book.  I was swept into the story by the narrator, who did an excellent job giving each character their own voice and accent.  I became so involved with the story that I was loathe to stop listening!  I am fairly new at listening to audio books and can find my attention getting diverted by outside interruptions. However, this book had my complete attention.  The author has created characters and scenic locations that, with the help of the narrator, came alive!  I have never been to Oxford, but the description of the Bodleian Library had me salivating! All those books! I could die happy there! There are some interesting characters that I enjoyed meeting, especially Mart (cook/housekeeper) (not sure of the correct spelling, as I had no reference bar the narrators)  and Isabelle (Matthew's mother).  They are completely different character types, but they compliment each other; You can feel the respect they have for each other.  The vampires in this story are far from being all sparkly, but I think it's the witches who are far more dangerous! The story has several twists and more magic than you can wave a wand at!  There is a dark scene that sent a shiver up my spine!  I am seriously considering getting this book in print, so that I can read it when I am not able to use my audio book app. I am most definitely looking forward to reading/listening to the next book in the series, because the ending left me wanting more!<br /><br />Deborah Harkness has created a world where humans, witches, daemons and vampires all live (not in peace, but tolerance?) together.  This author has now found another fan! I love her writing style, which is fast paced, and the story flowed beautifully!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you love your stories to be full of witches, daemons and vampires or if you love paranormal romance or urban fantasy genres. - Lynn Wortonach other.

1451695187|4.0|My wife and daughter found it thought provoking and will get more literature on the subject.  I will read it later.
B00EQ30RVY|5.0|From the first listen all the way through, I was hooked.  I love this EP and give the Deleos, Eric, and Chester a huge thumb up for pulling off a most difficult task: making a real and true STP record without Scott Weiland.<br /><br />And they did.  After multiple listens today, I'm still digging High Rise, even when listening to earlier STP right after another spin through the new one.  It stands up solidly. Haters gonna hate, but they're without cause--this is good stuff!<br /><br />The songs have all the elements and heart that make STP great and great STP.  To whit:<br /><br />Out of Time:  A hard-charging, balls-to-the-wall opener in the vein of classic, early STP. Great way to start off a record--no easing in, just hard and fast and getting right to it.<br /><br />Black Heart: Infectious and and upbeat, a classic STP rocker. Hooky and, for me, one of the standout tracks, complete with a soaring bridge and yeah yeah yeahs you can't help but join in with.<br /><br />Same on the Inside: Reminds me more of Army of Anyone than earlier STP (and that's a compliment, since I think AoA is, overall, a more consistent and solid record than most in the STP discography (in terms of solidly standout songs).  Pretty and a little sad.  Good stuff.<br /><br />Cry Cry:  Another hooky, rollicking song that's instantly classic and very recognizable--in a good way!<br /><br />Tomorrow:  More mellow and downbeat, with those signature Dean riffs (not just the heir to Jimmy page riffmastery, but a skillful and innovative player in his own right!), an in-the-pocket rhythm section, and soaring, soulful vocals.  A great pick to close the EP out.<br /><br />Chester's voice is definitely reminiscent (if lighter-textured) than Scott's voice, and it's pretty clear they found someone who would fit neatly into the trademark STP sound. That said, this record is not \\"faking\\" being an STP record--it's as good as most and better than some (I'm looking at you, 2010 eponymous titled release with your two or three standout tracks)!  Don't get me wrong, I think Weiland is hugely talented and would never downplay his contribution to the band's image and sound (although I think Robert is definitely the bandleader and creative force in much of their output)--but I just don't miss him on this record!  Chester handles his lead singer duties beautifully!  Critics may argue that he is trying too hard to sound like Scott (e.g., the yeah yeahs in Cry Cry), but I think he's just doing his thing and doing it well.<br /><br />I can't wait for more from them!  Way to go, guys!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|this game is a poor version of temple run. collecting bananas and endless running. updates cost tokens which you can collect or purchase using real money
B0094BB4TW|2.0|very slow, takes forever to update<br />overall lousy app, unable to update to my new kindle it keeps saying the phone I had 2 years ago!
0451450523|5.0|This is - by far - my favorite fantasy novel. It is beautifully written, imaginative, and thought provoking. During my first read through I kept a note pad just so I could write down all of my favorite passages. I love this book. Give it a try.
B000IOM1YQ|5.0|The remastering is very good. Some of the extras are a bit weak but always glad to here something that I haven't before.
B00E1LT41K|2.0|I watched some of the episodes on cable and also read the book. The author did a fair job of making an unlikeable character sympathetic, although she had to do it by making Margaret (Henry VII's mother) into an unsympathetic person. I found that the movie concentrated far too much on the sex scenes and not enough on the actual plot also. But then, this is a fault of most made for cable channel movies. Witness \\"Game of Thrones!\\"
B000JLQSWE|5.0|Very clear remaster copy and the bonus material is nice as well. It was good to hear something new that I haven't heard before.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|Great movie i think its one of the funny movies Jason Bateman has done next to Horrible boss's and Ryan is funny
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Get what you pay for. You can stream websites that other streaming boxes can't because you are using the full PC browser. Latency is a big issue especially when playing audio. Unsupported on my phone/tablet, my PC refuses to connect to it leaving my laptop the only thing in my house that can stream to the chromecast. quality is very meh, if the streaming boxes I already have just had a more full featured browser I'd have no use for this.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|These came in some of the nicest DVD cases I have ever seen, though I would have accepted less nice for less money. The remastered effects are tastefully done and add a lot for the modern viewer-no horrible Star Wars CGI here! My only gripe so far is that there are no English subtitles, which seems like a strange omission in a fancy set like this.<br /><br />Note: I am not a hard-core Star Trek fan, although I have watched all of the original series and think of it fondly.

B005LAII0S|5.0|didnt really know about the movie. its pretty scary. but thats ok. so its not for kids and my fault i didnt really read it. i thought its similar to ciinderella make up DVD with real people. thanks
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Over the past couple of years the zombie apocalypse genre has really exploded in almost every form of media. While I'll admit that the genre never really resonated with me like it did with others, I still found myself drawn to World War Z. Not because it looked different from the other films, video games, and novels out there and not because I'm a huge fan of Brad Pitt. It just looked... more humane than everything else I've seen up to this point. However, when it was all said and done, I can't say I enjoyed it as much as I hoped.<br /><br />Based on the 2006 novel of the same name, World War Z follows former United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Pitt). After being attacked by a hoard of zombies while sitting in traffic with his wife and kids, Gerry and his family find themselves on the run until a helicopter comes to pick them up and bring them to a U.S. Navy vessel. After his friend Thierry (Fana Mokoena) explains the situation, Gerry is forced to travel half-way across the world in order to find a cure for the virus. If not, he and his family are kicked off the vessel and left to fend for themselves.<br /><br />One of World War Z's strongest attributes is its inherent ability to keep you on the edge of your seat, literally. I usually watch movies laying down, but within the first fifteen minutes I found myself propped up in a seated position and I didn't move for the remainder of the movie. From start to finish, World War Z is an intense experience unlike any other. Whether Gerry is on the run from a massive group of zombies or creeping quietly through a zombie-infested building, your heart is bound to be pumping out of your chest. What makes it even more exciting is the fact that there's very little down time so this intensity is almost non-stop.<br /><br />Also, the CGI for this film is breathtakingly beautiful. The animation for the zombies is flawless and, at times, pretty insane. When you see these large flocks of zombies sprinting around, toppling over each other, or piling to reach the top of a gigantic wall, it's almost surreal. While I don't agree with the media's decision to constantly make these creatures sprint at 20+ mph, I can appreciate the level of detail that went into making them come to life. There's no doubt in my mind that it took a lot of time and dedication to make them perfect and it shows in the end.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's where most of my enjoyment stopped. I was pulled in because of these extreme situations, but the narrative surrounding these moments is nothing short of mediocre. I never felt attached to Gerry and I never cared about his well-being or that of his family. They were disposable bags of flesh in an unfortunate circumstance and I never felt like I ever gained an understanding of Gerry as a human being. The only character I truly held any attachment to was a young soldier by the name of Segen (Daniella Kertesz). She may have only had a few lines of dialogue, but she was the only one who actually felt like more than just a prop in the story.<br /><br />Another thing that genuinely bothered me was the lack of closure. The conclusion to the story is so open-ended that it left me begging the question, what was the point? We followed Gerry through attacks, chases, plane crashes, and the like, but for what? So he could find a \\"camouflage\\"? That's it? Really? It made the entire journey essentially meaningless. I understand that not every story needs a happy or perfect ending, but at least arrive at a point. There needs to be some meaning behind everything that happened. Otherwise it winds up just being wasted time.<br /><br />With that said, though, Brad Pitt worked really well with the material he was given. His performance wasn't jaw dropping and it's not going to go down as one of the best performances of his career, but he did well. He was able to bring some life to an otherwise two-dimensional character and I commend him for that. I also have to give Kertesz her recognition as well. As I said earlier, she doesn't have much dialogue, but it's her mannerisms that really stand out and show her ability as an actress. I can't comment too much on anyone else because a great majority of the acting came from Pitt. Everyone else just had a few minutes here and there.<br /><br />Finally, the score, composed Marco Beltrami was solid. Some of the compositions were a little too generic for my taste, but they worked well within the film itself. They were loud and robust when they needed to be, but also quiet and eerie in just the right places. Beltrami definitely had a good understanding of what needed to be present here and he delivered with the perfect score. While it may not be one of the most impressive I've heard this year, it fits for the source material.<br /><br />Overall Score: 6.75/10 - While I did find myself intrigued during certain areas of World War Z, I can't say that I was overly impressed with the end result. It aims to be a serious entry into a genre that usually fails to be anything more than bizarre, but in its efforts it lost any sort of life that could have made it a fantastic film. I would only recommend this to the hardcore zombie enthusiasts. If you're a casual like me then I would say skip it or give it a rental.
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|At least there's a tooltip temperature icon what my old built in Samsung app didn't do. App itself seems really simple but I don't need much.
0307352153|5.0|A well researched book for the 20th century. Accurate information that corrects the stereotypes of Introverts and Extroverts. After reading this there is a much clearer understanding of what makes an extrovert an extrovert and how they are identified and the same for introverts. This book is not just for Introverts but for extroverts as well because the Susan also talks about how extroverts and introverts can work together. Like a Yin and Yang she calls it. Overall a great read from beginning to end, a must read!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I never thought I would read this type of book In my life.  I am a sucker for romantic books, a total hopeless romantic.  Friends gave great reviews so I figured I would give the series a try.  I absolutely love this book.  I am not into kinky stuff but the book had a good storyline and  the sexual parts were exciting.  Something so different than I usually read. I thought this book would be so degrading and just about sex but it's not.  It opens a whole new world.  I am excited to start reading book 2!
B00BUVPIRS|1.0|I have a kindle fire with jelly bean installed, this app crashes during the install.  I have tried it 6 times with the same result, perhaps it has something to do with the SD partition on the kindle fire as mentioned on an earlier post.  If the app can be updated to fix this I will change my rating as of now I am just out the 7 bucks.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Wish there were more apps you could put on there. The setup was easy but have noticed that once you configure it for one network it is hard to port it around and make it work with different networks.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This weather app is the best thing they invented. I don't need to turn on my Tv to check for the weather. It's right here in the palms of my hands, and when ever I need to know what is going to be like the weather later on. Great app!
B005544TRQ|5.0|No dead time, amazing without commercials.  Little understanding of the law required.<br /><br />Sexy interplay without being either gross or offensive.

0399152717|2.0|Polar Shift is another installment of the Kirk Austin save the world memoir. Sadly, there are simply too many cheap, cinematic plot elements that eventually strain credulity and merely serve to create needless action. The main plot revolves around a megalomaniac anarchist teaming with a billionaire posturing as a foundation head battling multinational corporation, but secretly plotting to dominate the planet. These two are attempting to engineer a magnetic pole reversal that will upend all electronics. What concerns everyone else is  the possibility of a geologic polar reversal that will destroy all life on earth. The granddaughter of a Nazi era scientist is believed to possess the key to a \\"secret\\" formula that provides the key frequencies from this Kovacs Theorem that no one since his time has been able to work out. Needless to say, the granddaughter is clueless and happens to be off in Siberia.<br /><br />The US government also maintains a guy in Los Alamos posing as a nut case just in case someone shows up interested in the Theorem, while a Russian mafia hit squad is dispatched to Siberia to track down the girl who is being protected by an old WWII spy, now in his 80's. All ends well though because Kovacs just happened to encode his precious frequencies in a nursery rhyme his granddaughter recalls. Why you would hide the secret to preventing global disaster is never explained. The Siberian Russian mafia hit squad is also to be commended for causing the discovery of extant pygmy woolly mammoths as well. Our hero meanwhile manages to enjoy himself kayaking, paragliding, helicoptering as well as eluding an anarchist's biker gang with a antique diesel motorcar by disrupting a civil war reenactment.<br /><br />The characters are too one-dimensional, especially the villains who took their cues from James Bond bad guys. The whole story reads more like rejected script for a summer blockbuster that sounded good during the elevator pitch, but was found wanting when fleshed out.
B00DBOF5Q6|2.0|Very tedious and drawn out book. Quite heavy going in places with a disappointing ending. Not one I will read twice.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The learned author makes a brisk and tantalizing case for a thoroughly Jewish Jesus's plausible militant zealotry.  There are several important scholars, though, who have discussed Jewish Jesus and his religious-political actions that the author ought to have given more attention to such as Hugh Schonfield, Geza Vermes, David Flusser, James Charlesworth, Jeffrey Bütz, James Tabor, and Shimon Gibson.  Aslan is also too breezy when brushing aside evidence from reconstructed Q, the epistle of James, primitive Mark, and John, when assuming that primitive Christianity was preponderantly Pauline.  Overall, however, \\"Zealot\\" is an important corrective to insufficiently contextualized studies of the historical Jeshu.
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|Games that G5 puts out by Cateia are usually better than this one. There are no HO scenes, which the player may favor.  It was a bit expensive for the length and the puzzles were just so-so. Overall the game was kind of dull. Not really worth the money.
0810994739|5.0|The Wimpy Kid Diary.  What is there to say?  The third graders are going crazy over this collection.  We now have four of them.  They trade with other kids to be able to read all of them.  All I can say is, &#34;It's got them reading.&#34;
B003L5BRXK|4.0|I once had this record album. But this re-mastered version brings out the brilliance of this record. Rock and blues from top to bottom. The standards are great, Tumblin' dice, Happy, but so many great tunes.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Always solid recordings from Megadeth. Album has some shredding songs and also some more melodic songs as with most Megadeth albums.
1490313370|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed James Altucher's book Choose Yourself. I found his unconventional lists in each Chapter highly entertaining and keep coming back to them as references.  Great read for entrepreneurs or anyone wanting to get moving forward...Well done!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Dream Theater always puts out great albums. The musical talent within this band is often ignored because of not a whole lot of public radio play. But, anyone who knows this band and the members within it are renowned and respected within the music community and their peers. One of the best bands out there.
B00AYB12PC|5.0|After all these years that have passed since I first watched this film, this is still one of my favorites. It is both funny and suspenseful. I love the concept of \\"the rules\\" which is the list of stuff not to do when in a scary movie and is surprisingly accurate for most films. Definitely worth watching over again.
B004EPZ06G|4.0|fun movie to watch.good service and price.I enjoyed the first movie more, how ever this is a good follow up
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Good basic weather app with a nice clean interface. Does what it's supposed to do without any ads, annoying stuff. Not bad. Keep it up!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I do not know how they keep it up.Yet another great star trex  adventure bringing back KAHN- one of the greatest villians
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Welcome to the Hotel Bangerz! Such a Lovely Place. Such a Lovely face. Miley totally Rocks on this disc. Some songs such as Adore You and We Can't Stop and 4x4 and My Darlin are pretty fun. Some of the others give me a slight headache. She turns it up a notch on Side two. Way Cool.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|i Just wanted to say that Amazons streaming service is VERY good. we dont have a \\"High speed\\" network and it never paused. Very pleased. As of the movie its funny, of course its not like the Avengers so dont come into it thinking it will be.
0307477479|4.0|I read this book for a girlfriend weekend. I enjoyed it, but not everyone did; some felt that it was too... inter-looping.<br />I enjoyed the word play.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I enjoyed season three (and the earlier seasons) on TV.  Having the DVDs allows me to see the program again and again - appreciating some of the technical gems I missed the first time, like costumes, décor, body language and such.  I'll buy season four, when I can.
0812979656|4.0|This book is a very interesting read. The author spends the first 200 pages telling a story through the shattered and elusive eyes of a child. I assume that the author did this on purpose, because 200 pages in you finally get to the story and her writing style changes dramatically. The shift is undeniable. The twin children are trying to make sense of their childhood in the first two-thirds of the book, and then explain the story at the end so that the reader can put the pieces together. It was a great book, but only if you are able to go the distance. That is why I gave the book four instead of five stars. Because it takes so long to get to the story and to understand what is going on, I would think that many people would put it down before finding out. While it does not read like a suspense novel, the point of the story is sweet, poignant, and of course, tragic. The psychological writing is elusive, profound, and haunting...especially if you think of your own childhood and the elusive character of your own memories. Worth the read if you have the patience to see it through to the end.
B003UBTX72|4.0|Very little to dislike in this well written at times tragic and equally heroic figure. Keith and the Stones are legendary.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this set.  I love listening to it, I love watching the DVD.  My children love it and my students in my music classrooms love watching the videos.  Can't wait to get the next one!
B00C8RGOSA|5.0|I bought the movie for my son who saw it at a friend's house.  My son loves the movie, but my wife and I enjoy the movie also.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book and I am looking forward to reading the next two books. I think it's a book both men and women should read. Men can probably get a clue.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Loved this book. Now onward to the next. Can't stop now. Warning, these are addictive books to be sure. Enjoy!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I really enjoyed this book  Was it perfect? No, but I stayed glued to it until I finished it.  I love a historical novel and this was definitely a satisfying read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is the most realistic game ever! I mean you get to clean the horse and its stable and you get to ride the horse and it is AMAZING
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Product has worked great especially for a Road Warrior who needs the extra charge time during the day. Not needing to look for that plug and cord anymore.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I have fond memories of watching the original series with my Dad (first run). I remember the cartoon and have seen all the movies, though I haven't seen all the series.  That said, I am now a big fan of this reboot and look forward to more!
081099741X|5.0|I pre-ordered this book in April and today I finally got it in my hands. Being a filmmaker and die hard Wes Anderson fan buying it was a no brainer. However I didn't think I could be this impressed. It is absolutely beautiful filled with illustrations, production stills, story boards and much more. Not only all that but there are essays and interviews by Zoller, who has followed Anderson's career from the beginning, jam packed with details on his artistic process for the films, his thoughts on different circumstances surrounding his scripts and general Wes Anderson quotables.<br /><br />If you are a fan do yourself a favor and get this book you will not regret it!
0099519852|3.0|The author has a great idea but doesn't dilever it well. Repeating examples and not developing them. Not a good writer.
B00062PN6I|4.0|They sound very good. Good highs, good lows.  Only complaint, they could have routed the ear-to-ear wiring on TOP of the bow not UNDER where it is an irritant when wearing. Pads could have been a little thicker too, but at the price you get what you pay for.<br />Even with minor shortcomings they are a good value, and i would recommend.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|To each their own, right?  I've read the book previously but I still loved the movie.  Loved it so much I watched it twice more in the next 2 days!!
B000FBJHT4|4.0|Why did Phillip Corso write this book? That is the real question that haunts me.<br />Why would he risk his reputation near the end of his life to perpetrate a fraud?<br />Many of his accounts just have that &#34;ring of truth&#34; to them. many aren't over-the-top assertions but just bits of information that make you wonder. I hope one day everything will be revealed.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Definitely one of the best free apps of all time. Maybe even the best app period. I have spent hours on this game and I would definitely recommend it for anyone who likes star wars or angry birds.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|It was awesome movie and not to bad watching it in 3D. Loved how they took so w of the original Star Trek and incorporated it in the new one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Recommend for All ages. Loved the characters.  Loved the ending.  Even more loved the message.  Wish the series did not end at three.  Can not wait fur the second movie nes
B00B52FDXQ|4.0|Loved it along with all the seasons before it too. Definitely recommend this to everyone who is a fan of these types of tv shows
B0000AQS0F|3.0|WARNING: Contains spoilers about plot or character development:<br /><br />I can never justify this show being above 3 to 3.5 stars. Episodes \\"Heart of Gold\\" and \\"Objects in space\\" are both equally craptastic. It makes me wonder if they did not continue the series because they ran out of good ideas.<br /><br />The bad:<br />-River never develops in to anything. I thought she was more of an annoyance than anything.<br />Of all the cool guilds you could be part of, the companions guild is not one of them. The worst aspect of being a companion is that they seem to be highly respected.<br />Inara is easily disposable as a character. She brings nothing to the table besides the sword fighting conflict in episode \\"Shindig\\".<br /><br />Neutral:<br />-Shepherd Book is another character that lacks development. He's better developed than River but he still remains a mystery. Is he really a shepherd and what does it matter anyway?<br /><br />In one episode he receives medical attention from the alliance. And in another episode, \\"Objects in space\\" it is bluntly said that he is not a shepherd.<br /><br />My guess is that he may be a fellow soldier for the alliance. Yet, he does seem to lack military training.<br /><br />Whatever the case, he seems to follow his own path.<br /><br />Zoe is a Xena Warrior prototype.<br /><br />Positive:<br />Jayne is one of the best characters in the show. He is greedy. He walks a fine line of morality. When Jayne does choose the wrong path I think it pushes him in the opposite direction. He becomes stronger as a result. An unlikely \\"hero\\". I can't remember exactly what he said in episode, \\"Jaynestown\\". But I think he said something like, \\"A living legends needs eggs and milk (women)\\".<br /><br />If every woman smiled as much as Kaylee the world would be a better place. She's a very likeable character.<br /><br />Simeon has a big heart. He is trustworthy and brave. I enjoy characters who are willing to give up everything that they have to fight forwhat they believe in. Because he is a fugitive it pushes him to unexpected conflict.<br /><br />Mrs. Reynolds only appears in two episodes but I like her character much better than Inara. Shes more greedy than Jane and will back stab anyone to get what she wants. She has companion training and she uses that training for seduction\manipulation. She has a deadly combination of skills.<br /><br />Mal is one of the most developed characters. So I won't comment about him.
B009R659L8|5.0|Seemed very confusing at first. Three separate stories and characters. How the author brought them all together in the end was typical of Mary Higgins Clark's great writing skill!!! To be enjoyed by all ages..
B002N44XSG|5.0|My favorite part of the book was when they had the interviews with all of the main characters definitely a favorite!
B00003CWRX|5.0|I have watched this movie at least ten times.  It is one of those few films I reach for whenever it is a rainy day and I am looking for something to lift my spirits, or when I need to see something inspiring.<br />  Michael Mann does a yeoman's job directing this film - every frame betrays the hand of a master at his craft (or art if you prefer).  One of the many great strokes of genius is his dissolving a wall in a hotel room into a backyard where Jeffrey Weigand's (Russell Crowe at his understated best) children play.<br />  This is one film in which Pacino's \\"over the top\\" brand of acting is appropriate.  His role is that of a zealot, a man whose integrity of purpose can never be questioned; so when he revs up his motor and spins into overdrive one senses he is doing justice to the role.<br />  Unfortunately the movie is saddled with the tired old cliche of the wife who has no moral backbonme at all.  When Crowe informs her that he has been fired, the first thing she thinks of is not the terrible effect it must have on him, but of their health insurance and mortgage payments.  A soft place to land indeed.  I am always relieved when she leaves the film.  The actress is given nothing to do but suffer interminably and, sad to say, the audience has to suffer through her.<br />  Christopher Plummer, who, I am convinced, is incapable of turning in any less than an ingenious performance, is wry, cynical, and fiery as Mike Wallace.  His confrontation with Pacino in the hotel room provides a master class in acting.<br />  The film is well (not to say fast) paced, the supporting players all excellent.  The only complaint I have (aside from the above mentioned one) is the turgid score which sometimes gets in the way.  When Weigand's spot on 60 minutes is finally run in its entirety, the music employed is much too cloying - it sounds as though angelic hosts are dancing about Crowe's head.  Thye film is effective enough without our having to be hammered into submission by anoverpowering score.

The combination of being a board-certified neurologist and also a Fellow of the American College of Nutrition should give readers confidence that he has something to contribute which is scientifically sound and not influenced by the \\"department of agriculture - pharmaceutical industry complex\\"!  I dream of a world where most people understand that the inflammatory diseases that plague us today are in large part due to excessive consumption of carbohydrates, especially grains, and have acted on this simple concept resulting in significant improvement in health and significant reduction in healthcare costs.  This book, if widely read and taken to heart is a step in achieving such a dream.<br /><br />I have been in nutritional ketosis for almost two years now and it is amazingly simple to maintain while eating delicious meals and never being hungry like I was while eating a lot of carbohydrates (bread, pasta, sugar & starchy vegetables).  At 71 years of age, I am convinced that this is the best diet to help me avoid or at least deter the classic 'diseases of aging'. The benefits of a ketogenic diet and the dangers of grains have been available now for many years, thanks to the efforts of authors and bloggers like Richard Phinney, Jeff Volek, Peter Attia, Gary Taubes, William Davis, Thomas Seyfried, Nora Gedhaudas, Ron Rosedale, Richard Feinman, Eric Westman, Joseph Mercola and Jimmy Moore to name a few.  We have not yet influenced a critical mass of doctors or of the general public about the enormous upside potential of nutritional ketosis.  This contribution by Dr Perlmutter should help, and dear readers - I hope you will find this book helpful in your own quest for better health and share this knowledge with your friends (and doctors!).
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|An action-packed version, historically accurate I hope,  of the events that led to the assassination of Osama bin Laden.<br />One wonders if physical torture of potential informants really pays off or does methodical ground intelligence gathering really produce the results?  Or does it all boil down to a little luck thrown into the mix?
0767919408|5.0|Bryson's writing style is so effortlessly conversational, you feel like you're having a chat and a cup of coffee with a friend instead of reading a book. I read Bryson with a smile on my face.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This is a great book. Everything reads so true to life. It certainly gives one enough food for thought for a long time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is an incredible book and I admire this author. Suzanne Collins in an amazing author ans she is my inspiration on writing books. I am in love with the hunger games series, it is one of the best series on earth. I love you Suzanne Collins <3
B000ID37KO|4.0|I love Alfred Hitchcock, and this movie is certainly one of the classic Hitchcock films. The suspense is great all the way through, the audio is great, and if you like cliff hangers, it's a home run! I give the movie 4 stars instead of 5 because every time I watch this film, I'm disappointed in the ending. No wrap-up at all... unless I'm missing something.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I had to take away one star because it was obvious where this story was going from the start. Having said that, this was a totally enjoyable read with well-developed characters that you instantly cared about. Louisa Clark has been slogging along at a dead end job, but one which she enjoys, for five years when she is suddenly let go because the restaurant is closing. With few options, Lou accepts a position as companion/carer to Will Traynor, a wealthy young man whose life has been upended by a horrific traffic accident leaving him a quadriplegic. At their wits end, Will's parents are looking for someone who will be Will's friend and perhaps help pull him away from the edge of the abyss on which he teeters, having already attempted suicide to escape his altered life. Lou is from the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\" in comparison to the privileged life that Will has led, but her quirky take on life intrigues him and so the relationship begins. It becomes obvious pretty early on where this story is headed, but the tale is entertaining and I'll confess to becoming very attached to the characters and very vested in the outcome, even shedding more than one tear at the predictable conclusion. The debate over whether or not one should be allowed to decide to take one's own life rages on. Leaving that aside, this story kept me turning the pages and finishing the story in less than 24 hours.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to see the movie November 22.<br />Katniss and Peta kicking some capital butt. Catch the movie and check out YouTube for clips.
0385345054|5.0|I have yet to see results from this book as I purchased it as a gift for a colleague who is still teaching in the classroom. She is extremely gifted as a teacher, artist and friend. I expect to see great things.<br /><br />Jacqueline Harrington
B00A8ECU24|4.0|It's a pretty good game BUUUUTT, the prices are absolutely terable (Can't spell :P) prices!!<br />Why don't they change them well they want more money ofcorse!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Five star d/t the bravery of being able to write about this experience.  Takes a lot if courage to be as strong as she is now.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|I saw this in the theater. It is absolutely wonderful. Everything about this is great. The packaging is beautiful and the recording sounds amazing!
B005CAAU76|4.0|I have never owned this particular Queen album in any form before.  It's good - has a varied program, and the extra cuts are nice.  I now have the first eight of the Queen remasters from 2011, which blow away all previous editions for sound quality.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My kids have their own horses they can ride. They love this game. This game is very interactive and fun for little minds.
193700788X|2.0|Nothing compared to her earlier books. You could tell she is tired of the series. I would have loved it to have ended stronger.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|This one of the BEST CD's Nightwish has done with Annete as a singer, excellently written and a beat that's hard not to follow. Some of the songs I like the most are 'I want my tears back' and 'Ghost River,' because Marcus also has an awesome voice and has great solos in both of them, and 'Storytime,' because it is like 'Escapist' and 'Amaranth from previous albums; just a knockout song with great lyrics and flow, and something you can listen to over and over again. Every song on the CD is completely awesome, and it's hard not to listen to the whole thing back to back.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|The show on Netflix is awesome but reading it takes it to a whole new level.  This book is very well written.  Thanks
1250029465|3.0|James Bowen really has an amazing story to tell, and sure it's a very touching one. But he's not a real writer... it would work better in another media, like a movie or a documentary. I hope they can do that, Bob certainly would appreciate it.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|From M. Knight, I found myself pushing the I believe one too many times.  Why are the aliens always naked.  Why fight giant monsters with swords?  Why does the giant bird care?  They show so much futuristic technology.  The entire film seemed an overindulgent Will/Jaden Smith homage.  Still despite the glaring gaps, it was entertaining.  Jaden's screechy voice is burned into my psyche, but I would watch it again for free on TNT.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast is a great piece of technology, especially considering the price point and what it offers, not just now, but in the future as more apps/streaming options become available.  Set-up on a dual-band WiFi router was a little tricky for me.  If you have a  dual-band router, I would suggest doing web searches prior to ordering the Chromecast, so you are at least familiar with what you may be up against when it arrives.  After about an hour, I was able to get it to work - don't give up!<br />What it does well:<br />1. Watching YouTube videos from my Nexus tablet or Windows 8 Tablet - so much better on the TV when I want to show my kids something.<br />2. Netflix streaming videos from my Nexus tablet - I find it great that I can get a show going for my kids and then use the Nexus to browse, check Facebook, etc, while they are still watching their program. I don't really care to watch what they are watching, so I enjoy this feature.<br />3. Google Play TV - This is a nice touch from my Nexus tablet as we don't have cable/satellite at home so we buy the TV shows that we want to see and the Chromecast delivers!<br /><br />What I wish it did:<br />1. Watch ESPN - again, since I don't have cable/satellite, it would be great to have ESPN support on the Watch ESPN app for the Nexus &/or web-support from my Windows 8 Tablet/PC.  No dice yet, so I run HDMI from my Windows 8 Tablet to the TV or use the app on my Xbox 360.  1st world problems, right?<br />2. XBMC support - this will probably not ever happen, but here's to wishing.<br /><br />Overall, this is a cool little device and I'm anxious to try this out when I go to my in-laws for the holidays or on the road at a hotel, to see how easy/difficult it may be to set-up.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|Turn Auto Location off and it won't use GPS. Gives good hourly forecast. Very simple, as advertised. I like it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This was one of my absolute favorite games.  So much easier to play on the tablet than on the Wii too.  I just wish my daughter hadn't broke her tablet, because now I can't play it :(
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I'm learning a lot about myself and my thoughts through this book.  It is well worth the read.  Thank you.
0307120007|5.0|This book is legendary in our house.  My daughter loved it so much she wore it out.  So when I found I was pregnant with my son, I immediately purchased another one.  Or, I mean the Easter bunny left it for him ;)  He is just as much in love with it as she was.
B000EXZI14|4.0|The CD is just as great as the DVD is, but the CD is missing the very best part of the DVD - Run To Me. If you like the CD, you should buy the DVD just to watch the best song of the whole performance. Run To Me is short in the DVD like Nights On Broadway is, and was far from my favorite Bee Gees song in the past - but now any good friend that I have come over I show Run To Me on the DVD because it is amazing. I bought this CD without looking because I just assumed that the entire performance would be on the CD, and certainly that they would not cut the very best song out of the CD! The rest of the CD is great just like the DVD is, but I was extremely disappointed because Run To Me was the main reason that I even bought the CD.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Apparently anyone who is anyone knows how to play & loves this game.  Me on the otherhand, I just can't get it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Lots of action, Fun, a must to own.!!!  You will fall in love with double oo7.  Hopefully they will make 1 more to carry on.
B005HSL626|5.0|We loved the demo so much that we ended up purchasing the full game.  Not like me at all!  Definitely worth it though.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|We really enjoyed it. Interesting story line. Can't wait to see the next one. As always, love Pepper Pots. She is a wonderful character.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|This movie was great.  We played it all season long & for quire awhile after too.  My son was only a few months old & recovering from a large battle with RSV.  But when this movie played in front of him while he was in his swing, you would swear nothing was wrong with him.  And for the girls, well anything having anything to do with Justin Bieber is instantly popular!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed it immensely. Spent a lot of time relaxing while figuring out how to escape each room.  Looking forward to more challenges.
B005LAIISU|5.0|We just love the Ice Age movies!  Clever & hysterical.  Great for family movie nights!  We've got them all :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|All the fuss everyone has made about these books and movies is not exaggerated. It was time and money well spent purchasing the set of these. Enough said.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Action, adventure and a new surprise around every corner. I can't wait to start the next book in this series!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a breath of fresh air! I couldn't put this book down. Complex, compassionate and insightful. I was intrigued by the narrative, delighted by the dialogue,and impressed by the plot. The ending was amazing.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Title says it all. These guys just get better and better! Do your ears a favor and pick this up.
034580404X|5.0|first, the books arrived when expected, the attention i received from the supplier was superb! second, the books themselves were never as people talked about, i was very please (and still am) with how the books developed. the writer is very talented and knows how to keep you in suspense.
B002S45V32|4.0|I &#60;3 80's romantic comedies. There are several things to enjoy about this movie. As with most from this genre the girl gets the guy! Love the fashion and the music. Compared to today's movies this classic is one that you can watch over and over again without getting bored.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A must read for every American. A glimpse of what patriots are willing to do, are willing to sacrifice for their county.
B00D8HNR5W|5.0|The CD is a fantastic listen; I'd recommend this album to new or old fans of Nine Inch Nails. I don't know; music in general is interpreted differently by everyone, but I feel this album is worthy of acclaim and enjoyment.
B00F2362IE|3.0|The game itself is enjoyable but it glitches often and freezes so often that I've had to restart my kindle twice now. I want to like it but the load times are a touch too long and the freezing is just unforgivable. Save your money until they fix it.
B009GJ870Q|5.0|From the first chapter to the last I did not put this down- so unbelievably sad I'm finished it. Best book I have ever read.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I love this DVD set so much! It's amazing to have one box set with 10 years of a show that is one of my all-time favorites! I had no issues with the DVD quality, every episode played perfectly for me. Also, the packaging was so pretty! However, I do agree with the concern about how tightly the discs are packaged in. I was able to transfer my discs to another holder pretty easily, with no scratches. So, I would definitely recommend putting the discs in another case. To me it was definitely worth buying this set, I love it!!
0061950726|5.0|This is a very well written novel depicting live as an orphan train child. The author very cleverly tied the story to present time and that of a foster child's similar experience. I thoroughly enjoyed this book!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|One enjoyable book-highly recommend it! This is a read that you can't put down. Characters were easy to remember and look forward to reading more of Liane Moriarty.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|This is the finest recording of wonderful music.  I bought my original copy of the 25th Anniversary from PBS for a $200 contribution and felt I had not paid to much.  Our home burned and we lost the copy.  When I saw the recent movie, which was remarkably good, I had to have this exceptional recording again and I am delighted with the purchase.  Highly recommended if you love exceptional music.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|It is clean with few permissions. It does what it says it will do and has visual appeal. It does have widgets despite another review I read. The only negatives I saw was that it did not use my current location and the widgets did not match my wallpaper well.  Probably my 2nd favorite weather app. Could be my first. I am still deciding.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have never really considered myself an avid Stephen king reader but I picked up this book because of the title. This book is a pager turner (and I hate that cliche) I really never wanted to put it down but I had to live right!  Any way this is a great book you will not be sorry
B002NEFL8W|5.0|If you are looking for a professional feel and being able to take endless photos without having to switch batteries this is the thing you've been waiting for.  Also, the ability to square off side shots that are cumbersome to say the least without the extra snap shot button is priceless.  Very happy with my purchase!
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|This app works great on my kindle fire. I'm in Cotacachi, Ecuador and the locator found my weather conditions immediately. I don't need it to do much and it's doing those things perfectly.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Great movie.  I wish I could get the 3D version only, without the other disks at a lower price. Thanks
B00BG08FKK|5.0|My mom loved this movie so much that I bought the soundtrack for her.  She loves it and plays it constantly.  I was not a personal fan of a movie that had no speaking parts...only singing.  What is torture for me is candy to others.  To each, his own.  Since my Mom loves it....I'll give it 5 stars.  It's the whole movie on an audio CD.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Got the kindle fire for my 2 yr nd hated all the adds lol All i did was pay 2bucks for thoses stupid adds to come off lol worth every penny lol love youtube!!!!!!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game so so much but sometimes it is really gross. my dad thinks the video is so funny but my mom thinks other wise.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|I Had fun with this game . It is Worth the price at 99 cents.  This is Good for an afternoon break
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My children love it! They all have their own horses and love to take care of them!! I enjoy playing as well!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|They always have different music and it always sets the tone of the scene perfect.  I like that the music is not main stream and is different.  It is as always very much enjoyable.  Breaking dawn is a little different but none the less still outstanding in my book.
0156030306|3.0|In the first two hundred pages, Flowers for Algernon has been a good but sad reading about Charlie Gordon. Then, somehow, the mood sours for the last almost one hundred pages because Charlie has become emotionally screwed.<br /><br />Although the point is made, it is hard for me to get through the book to the end. Honestly, the inevitable end can have been made shorter since it is such a drag on my eyes.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Daniel Keyes tries to associate intelligence with evil and rationalize the association because it seems to offer emptiness and perhaps hollowness in people's lives. I'll have to disagree with the statement because I've always considered it as a fulfilling part of life.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is a nice point about the need of an emotional balance to outweigh everything else to restore the order of a person's life. That's evidently what is missing in post-operation Charlie's life before his slow deterioration.<br /><br />Interestingly, Daniel Keyes throws in the socialization part as a way to feel fulfilled because that part was missing in the entirety of Charlie's life. I'll agree with the lack of fulfillment unless Charlie had a strong contacts through his networking.<br /><br />Granted, Fay is an absolute joke, and there might be a strong guess that the disorders may have run strongly in Rose's life, causing Charlie to become what he is.<br /><br />All in all, Flowers for Algernon is an up-and-down book for me to read, but it's been an interesting trip.
B002RI99IM|5.0|In a very simple way Nassim shows the contraddiction of our society behaviour and the negation of the evidence that causes most of our troubles ! There are some parts more technical on statistics but explained very clearly. I suggest the book to alle the people wants to understand what NOT TO DO when they have to take a decision in many different domains
B000NDDHG8|5.0|Great! The Austrailian release has all the songs that the UK version has not. I highley reccomend any fan to buy this CD
B003204MQS|2.0|Wow. Really? Bad home video, not even as interesting as the Blair Witch Project. I cannot say how dull this really was. I have seen home slide shows of trips that were more exciting. Yes -- let's call Uncle Haylett and Aunt Kate. Their pictures of Africa outdid this. Massive - oh wait fell asleep. There was a yawn.
B0000W6SYK|5.0|I am lucky. I lived in the age when the man left the earth. I remember clearly October 4th, when the Sputnik 1 was launched, April 12th 1961 when Gagarin left the Earth, and June 20th 1969 and Amstrong and Aldrin.<br /><br />This book brings closer the background history of this fascinating age.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I love pinterest, but since the last update there are so many problems. The app crashes constantly and I often have to reboot the entire Kindle to get it to work properly. I've deleted and reinstalled many times, but the problems persist. I really wish they would fix these problems or change it back to the previous version.
B002RI9M2U|5.0|Brings awareness to how your actions can impact another so immensely. The writer keeps you hooked with his style of writing and interesting storyline.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have never played before. It is fun and easy to learn. I recommend this app. Fun for all ages.
0741470314|5.0|In August this year, I had gladly accepted the offer of Karen to order her eBook. I just could not put it out of my hands, it was so interesting and well written. The English is easy to understand.<br />This is the book that was prompted by Karen's work with two of MJ's bodyguards, but they could not agree on how it should be published. Here Dr. Karen jumped and fortunately has brought her project to an end. But there are many other stories, not only of the bodyguards, included. A must for any MJ fan
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Good thing about the dress up as a budget of hollywood reporter who have not been able to make your life is not have to make sure you don't need for you don't want the game
B000NIVJHM|5.0|I added this to my collection because I enjoyed the nastalgia of the entire movie, the characters and the story line the first time around when I saw it originally in the movie theater.  I don't have to run anywhere to return it on time, nor am I required to pay to rent it for only a limited amount of hours.  It is mine to watch any time I want to so why not have this classic at my fingertips to watch whenever I'm feeling like watching a great &#34;chick flick&#34;!
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|This book is Great for kids of 9 and it is interesting and cool for me and i hope for you
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Channing Tatum dancing and stripping any time I want - need I say any more?  Another perk is this movie came in different formats so you can see Channing Tatum anywhere anytime you want to!
B00DV3A84G|4.0|This cd is defintely a more polilshed effort than their first one, some may say too polished but I enjoy it. some of the songs are quite catchy although maybe a little too pop for some
B000002GFC|5.0|Enjoy hearing all of the classic songs with this purchase. I bought this for my husband and he was really happy with the purchase.
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|The one thing that stands out about this game is that the battling system is well polished. Though this is a freemuim game you DON'T need to buy extra manifolds in any situation. You can beat the game by simply playing it and lightly lvl grinding. All in all battle nation is a great game that really excels in its battling system.
B004WMKXWM|5.0|I ordered this through Amazon's instant video service on my Roku, and it worked great. I was able to watch the movie instantly without any &#34;hiccups&#34; that can sometimes occur when using the Roku. The service works great and I will definitely use it again.
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|sHORT AND SWEET, I LOVE THIS NIRVANA WITH PAT SMEAR, THE CONCERT (NOW IS FULL WITH 8 PLUS SONGS THAN WHAT MTV AIRED) IS GREAT AND THE FINAL 10 SECONDS BEFORE COBAIN LEAVES THE STAGE TO ME RESUMES WHAT KURT WAS FEELING MONTHS BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT....THE SPECIAL FEATURES ARE GREAT TOO.
B00271SFB6|5.0|We ordered this on the Amazon Instant Video through our Roku player, and it came in fine, no hiccups watching it and it was an AWESOME movie.
B004HYDL1K|5.0|Great movie if you just expect insanely unrealistic and entertaining fight scenes and don't mind some blood and violence.  Pretty funny too.
B00A5IYAGM|4.0|My boyfriend ordered this because he had to watch it for school. I can't say much but he said it was what he needed for his assignment and it worked fine on the instant video via Roku.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This is a great movie. I have been a fan of Star Trek for a long time and this just totally reboots the franchise to another level. Would recommend it to any sci-fi fan.
B00005JOA0|1.0|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall by Anne Bronte is one of my favorite novels, alongside Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. I am currently writing my dissertation on the first two in addition to Geraldine Jewsbury's The Half-Sisters and Dinah Craik's Olive (novels that were popular alongside the Brontes'). I was so excited when I sat down to watch this movie version and was absolutely disgusted by the end. There is no rape in the novel version, and there is no reason for it in the movie version. Yes, spousal rape occurred in Victorian England, and yes, it still occurs today, but that is not something Anne Bronte would have written about nor did she. This is just one of the many reasons this is a horrible, horrible adaptation of a wonderful novel.<br /><br />We have enough Jane Eyre adaptions; will someone please remake this so all of us who have been traumatized can enjoy Anne Bronte's wonderful work in movie form!
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Loved the characters, the storyline. One of the most provocative books I have read this year. First one I have not figured out who the murderer was until the very end.
B00DVPN0W6|3.0|I have been an Amos Lee fan for while, own all his CD's, Vinyl, and love all his previous work. Comparing this to past cd's I would have to rank this last; this is more praise for his previous albums then being disappointed in this one as this album is still very good. Listening through the album there was no catch, nothing that made me tap my foot like previous albums. The best songs on this CD in my opinion are Indonesia, The Man that wants You, and Chill in the Air.<br /><br />Amos started as a bluesy artist with his self-titled album and moved to a little more up tempo in Supply and Demand. Last Days at the Lodge and Mission Bell is where he started really putting folk into his sound. As the Crow Flies was an extension of Mission Bell. Mountains of Sorrow doesn't seem to have a distinct feel I can put my finger on. The Man that Wants you is an up tempo song with lots of brass instruments while others are more bluegrass and some are depressing.<br /><br />This album just doesn't seem to have a theme and just a mismatch of songs. I'm still a fan of Amos Lee but this is probably his worst album yet. My rank: Amos Lee, Mission Bell, Supply & Demand, Last Days at the Lodge, As the Crow Flies, Mountains of Sorrow.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Started out liking the story.....<br />Great pacing and characters but it did not hold my interest....eventually.....<br />Too predicable for me
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun and entertaining, harder than the normal temple run games so my 5 and 7 year old don't like it.  however with that said it makes it extremely fun for me to play.
B0035F0MTG|4.0|but I have a big question, why is the digital version of Yuja Wang's CD is always missing the last track compared to the iTunes version?<br />Yuja's play is great but I am giving a four star because of the amazon version of the cd.<br />In fact, the amazon digital music is always missing a bonus track (I don't know if it is a bonus track)<br />in this album, the iTunes version has 34 songs. amazon version has 33 songs.<br />in the album \\"fantasia\\",  the iTunes version has 19 songs. amazon version has 18 songs.<br />in the album \\"Rachmaninov\\",  the iTunes version has 30 songs. amazon version has 29 songs.<br />for the other two albums of Yuja Wang, iTunes version also has one more song.<br /><br />the auto rip feature is nice but if it's one song less... I will buy from iTunes next time.
B00DJXSKWU|1.0|Want to know how to keep a blonde busy for hours?? Give this game. The game doesn't seem bad graphically. However, the screen keeps flipping upside down. So I turn the tablet over and the screen flips upside down again. ANNOYING!! Please fix or refund.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|A nice little adventure game with good graphics and storyline with plenty of mini puzzles to keep the old grey cells ticking over,with the added benefit of a quick recharging hint button for if it does get tough. All in all a fantastic game for free if you like adventure and hidden object games.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|this a fun game and hope that they make more games by king available to play on the kindle!! I recommend! !
B00AHHODH2|5.0|The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club is an intriguing mystery that hooked me from the first page.  The characters are compelling and I really enjoyed getting to know them and their quirks.  The plot unfolded at a steady plot and there were a few unexpected twists that intrigued me.<br /><br />Whitehead writes very well, keeping the reader slightly flummoxed but wanting to know more and the reasons why some things happen like they did.  I look forward to reading more from this exciting new suspense author! Well recommended!
B008WCP2PG|4.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift.  My Daughter loves it.  My wife says it is a great movie as well.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I can't wait for the last book in this trilogy to come out , I hope this year. The first two are wonderful reading. Everyone that I know who has read them agrees that the books are more than wonderful!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an amazing story of true love and sentiment.  I laughed, cried, and cried some more, but I will be reading it over and over again.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book seemed too much like the last book to me, but I enjoyed it any way. Looking forward to another story, maybe a little deeper next time.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Loved the scenery and the story.  However I thought it a bit too dark and a bit too long.<br />Could have shortened those bloody scenes a bit.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Can't wait for the last book in this trilogy!  The first two have been fascinating. If you like a history of a land and a novel about families and the times, this is it!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wow, this was exciting. Three lives of three different women. You don't know where it's all going to go until BAM, they all collide together and come full circle. The writing was crafty and interesting and overall good story. Then you get to the epilogue and BAM again!! Everything you thought you knew happened is all being questioned. This was my first Liane Moriarty book but I will be reading more for sure.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Like the Pillars of the Earth it also tells a history of the people in a story that is interestingly told. I think it is his style of writing that I never seem to tire of.<br />I am looking forward to the last book in his trilogy of his latest novels! Hope that will happen soon.
B000001GQC|5.0|This is a handy one-CD collection of some of Sergey Prokof'yev's classic and most enjoyable works. I didn't feel there was much in the way of background notes or information though. But the disk itself was fine.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was really surprised at how well this book did. I guess it just isn't my type of book. It seemed very silly to me at times, the way she acted that is.<br />Some people that I talked to about this book thought I didn't like it because I don't resd Mystery stories ?
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|I decided to rent this movie because...heck...I like sci-fi. Good/Bad & Ugly. I'll let you know which this is at the end.<br /><br />This will be a running commentary as I watch.<br /><br />#1. Will Smith's son as narrator...MUSH mouth doesn't BEGIN to describe. The boy enunciates his speech as well as if he had a mouth full of marbles. I had to turn on captions just to understand WHAT he was saying!<br />#2. I'm up to the part just after the baboon chase. Son far, the kid is a good actor and I am very much enjoying this film. But what kind of baboon gets a rock square in the face and just shrugs it off?<br />#3. Unanswered question: why does the kid need breathing aides on Earth?<br />#4. Unanswered question: why does it get below freezing every night?<br />#5. Cool Factor: I LOVE how in the absence of humans and plentiful food sources...predators have giant-sized like they were in the Pliocene ere.<br />#6. Stupid...a space fairing society that can produce artificial wormholes for travel and their primary weapons system is a glorified spear? Gimme a break!<br />#7. Stupid...he's a got an arterial bypass connected to a monitor and when it fails...there's NO alarm? HUH!?!?!?!<br /><br />Overall...I enjoyed it.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I think Tina Fey could do better than this book. Every one seems to want to get a book out there, and people buy them so of course they write them & it was a best seller so maybe it's just me.
B006ZN7KMM|5.0|Hay todo tipo de historias realmente, y lo m&aacute;s interesante es que lleva al lector a sentir y ver las diferentes &eacute;pocas de cada historia desde un punto de vista real. Muy buena selecci&oacute;n, merece estar en el estante electr&oacute;nico de cualquier biblioteca virtual.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I have had a number of times the game has completely quit or stalled. On stalls numbers are given rapidly to catch up.The freezes take place after game play while waiting on Chests to open, so, you win nothing, but the game play is deducted from your credits before you start to play.<br /><br />The tournament has standard players competing with elite players. It is common for an elite player to make thousands of coins in 5 rounds. I, as a standard player, rarely make more than 250 coins in 5 rounds. Yet, some collection items can only be won if you place in the top 250 players. I don't have a chance. I feel fortunate if I place under 2,000.<br /><br />So, why do I play Tournament games? To win free stuff that I can use in the regular games. Regular gameplay would get 3 stars if this Rate Us screen didn't appear every day. Same problems in regular games as Tournament, just not as tense of play.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I don't remember ever crying so much over a book. The story was captivating and emotional. I highly recommend it.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|5 minutes of will smith, 90 minutes of his son. Horrible acting. Horrible plot. Horrible movie...and I expected such great things...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is easy to play, and has enough depth to keep your interest.  Very cool for a free game.  I play a little<br />each night while settling in.
0785153942|5.0|If you're a fan of the movie, you'll really enjoy this graphic novel. Set as a series of flashbacks to tell the story of the beginning of the Kaiju War, this provides insights into some favorite characters, as well as information about how the Jaeger project started.
B008220BP2|5.0|Great movie that ties to very different genres together. Very entertaining and actually has a good underlying message about judgment.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I bought the Night Circus on a whim while visiting San Francisco. To get it out of the way - the descriptions in the novel were breathtaking. It seemed Morgenstern took as much pride as a magician in unfolding her world in a mystical sort of way. And like a magician the descriptions distract from the main characters that if left in another world could seem flat. They had an element of depth to them, but in a 3-D theatrical set sort of way. But on the other hand, it did add to the charm of the book. The danger was slow and I would have liked to see the author take a few more risks, but in the end, it was an enjoyable book for a San Francisco autumn holiday.
B005VPSEK2|5.0|My personal cheer me up music! Kelly Clarkson is very talented, the very first American Idol winner too for  good reason.  Try it you will enjoy!
B004LROUNG|4.0|After the Firm I lost track of him. Now with Calico Joe and this ditty I gained a great appreciation of Grishams works. Read a nd enjoy
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I have only recently started to listen to this band.  I really love it. Several tracts are repeated with guests and the first track with Rob Halford totally ROCKS! I will very likely buy more from this band.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I can do all kinds of extreme movements with it and it don't have to worry about it falling nor turning away from the angle. Definitely for the wild and crazy shots.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|My five year old son loved this Star Wars Lego set. And, I love that it came with r2d2, C3po, two clone troopers, AND a cool pod all for the price of just one of these mini figures, this is a great buy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved how Flynn wrote these characters.  It was so interesting how we were really in their heads through all the twists and turns.  Nothing felt surface-level, I was constantly reading between the lines.  Kept me thinking the whole way through.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This is a great quality little bag. My son got this and around eight small Star Wars Lego sets (they came with around 13 mini figures as well) and they all fit just fine. He really likes to play with it and keep his Star Wars sets separate from his other non-StarWars sets in it.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|It borrows too much from a very sucessful formula in Star Trek &#34;history&#34;.  It would have been better to re-explore the origins of the Star Trek universe and develop something new.  This movie disappoints following a very well composed reintroduction of characters started in the prior movie.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love these puzzles, so many scenes to choose from, one for any mood. The graphics are great and I really like the layout of the game. The fact that you can turn pieces is amazing. It's my new favorite game, going to get more. If you like puzzles this is for you.
3836538725|5.0|Sebastiao Salgado can transmit poetry and beauty in his images as well as a connection with nature rarely seen.<br />This work is really beautiful I do recommend buying it.
B005IZLPME|4.0|its awesome in 3D! We saw it in the theater & it played out just same on blueray at home
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Be careful...this item is not compatible with your wifi if you have an Airport Extreme (Apple), unless you downgrade the version you use on the Airport Extreme router. Am I not surprised that a Google product does not work with an Apple product?  Coincidence?  Grow up Google...
B00CH26TL8|3.0|This is a fun game but I hate that you run out of life's so quickly. I wish that you had unlimited life's. I like the graphics and the fact that you can connect to Facebook..
014241722X|4.0|Wasn't familiar with this series, but enjoyed. I ordered two of the series and will be sure to share with my grandsons.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This is by far one of the best books ever written in my opinion. It is a book that everybody needs to read.
B000002IOJ|3.0|2.5 stars.<br /><br />Underwhelming, basically an album full of filler, with a few stand-out tracks. The first one is...uh...wait, I can't remember. I guess that's because there are no stand-out tracks. BECAUSE IT'S ALL FILLER. Seriously. It's amazing how much better &#34;The New Order&#34; is.<br /><br />I know that people rave about the first album, and many people give props to this one, but I just can't get into it, not after a steady diet of Megadeth, Slayer, and &#34;The New Order,&#34; etc. You have to be a superfan, or an apologist to give this props. I admit that one or two times listening to it, I did get into it. But most of the time it seriously sounds like an album full of filler tracks.<br /><br />Save your money and spend it on &#34;The New Order,&#34; &#34;The Gathering,&#34; or &#34;The Formation of Damnation.&#34;
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Original and well written. He's created a cool, detailed world, but not to the extent that it detracts from the plot, which, in my opinion, is the downfall of a lot of science fiction books
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|This app is perfectly fine and way better then the preinstalled weather app that came with the phone.<br />Simple and provides a full day plus weather plus a forecast for the week.
B002ZG993Q|3.0|This is a redemption story: a lost soul who has repeatedly committed the sin of murder finds redemption through the love of a fallen woman (Mary Magdalena parallels are all too obvious) and a priest. Sadly, no one seems to have told the marketing department. The trailers show it to be a thriller action movie. No wonder audiences were disappointed.
B0014H32MG|4.0|Much better than the movie and I enjoyed the ending. The pacing was pitch perfect. The story is quite original and you get the feeling a lot of it was ripped off in the Hunger Games.
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|This app DOES have ads. It is a battery hog. There is no radar/satellite info; it does not even link to it even though the weather info is skimmed from Weather Underground.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|Good first book of a series. Will Robie clearly has a lot of potential as a character and I'm looking forward to seeing where this series takes him.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse works great, its really sensitive, and the software for it works quite well.<br /><br />The weights included are beyond useful, I dont think I could use this mouse without the weights.<br /><br />My only problem was temporary, it seemed like the mouse would click sometimes even tho I didnt actually click, any slight pressure would make it click; but the mouse is working now without that issue, so Im happy
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|Minecraft seems to be THE obsession of 4th grade boys, and our son is no exception. Bought the first set (original), then noticed the other 2 sets in the series (As of this date, the village and the nether are not yet available directly from Lego). Bought them immediately, because I am sure they will be quite hard to find when Christmas arrives.
B009ZG6YQO|4.0|I like the different view of the Arthurian Story & it is something that I have read several time over the years & I was pleased to get it for my Kindle
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|Bought the first 2 and wanted the complete set for our 9 year old son. These sets are a little pricey for the size, but as with anything, you are paying for the name (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Coach, Gucci, etc.). Minecraft is quite the craze with upper elementary aged boys in our area. I believe this will be very difficult to find closer to Christmas, so I purchased it now and put it away for the holiday.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|I purchased this Bluetooth unit to use in my truck, which does not have Bluetooth capability.  After researching units on Amazon, I chose this unit based on its rating and ease-of-use.  When the SuperTooth Buddy arrived, I had it paired with my cell phone in less than a minute after a brief review of the instructions.  Although I have only had time to test it briefly, the party on the other end said the sound quality was at least as good as the Bluetooth earpiece I use normally.  I was particularly impressed with one of the \\"small touches.\\" This is a visor-clip-mounted unit, like so many others for use in a vehicle.  This one actually has a small magnet on the back which attaches it to the visor clip; this arrangement makes it easy to move the unit to the other side of the clip when the visor is in use.  Some thought went into this design.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Bought this for our 9 year old son, who is obsessed with Minecraft and Lego. He built this independently and in a short amount of time. He since has changed it and added other Lego blocks to expand it. He really enjoys that he can now manipulate a &#34;real&#34; minecraft world. We like that he can still play minecraft, but not have to stare at a screen to do it.
B00FEN1C50|4.0|Don't look here. Go watch the movie. It's good. If you like big mechanical things that kick butt and you like Godzilla vs. anything, you'll dig it.<br /><br />Why are you still here? Don't stalk, watch.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Actually, we're keeping it, but as Christmas approaches, it would make a great gift for someone you love who loves this story.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think if you love horses like me this is a game for you! Quick easy and fun!!!!!!!!!<br />Great for anyone who has a horse and knows what it feels like to own a horse!!!!!
B000001EG6|5.0|Great CD - love the songs, melodies, etc..  One of his best. I would highly recommend purchase of CD. Five stars
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my 7 yr old and 9 yr old grandchildren loved playing this on my kindle.<br />Lots of fun and easy to play
B000002J0N|5.0|Love the songs and melodies.  Would recommend purchase of this CD. This album is one of my favorites of CSN.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Do not have very many apps and not enough to match Apple TV . Just Internet connection to TV is enough<br />Can not use very much
B008Y212PI|5.0|I never played this type of puzlez game before...glad I tried it! Entertained me and I will purchase more. Thought the demo video was really good. It made the game play very clear. Great job!
B001ANSS5K|4.0|When I finished this book, I actually couldn't decide if I liked it or not. But I keep thinking about it, so I guess it stuck with me, thus the 4 stars. (I will touch on plot points, but try to avoid detailed spoilers in the rest of the review).<br /><br />I absolutely adored the first 25% of the book. Margo and Q's interactions were fun, and the writing and plot kept me reading and trying to figure out where this crazy adventure was going. Margo was the kind of friend I wanted - who just... knew how to LIVE. Or so it seemed.<br /><br />But then Margo is pretty much absent for the other 75% of the book - during which Q tries to find her through understanding her. And while Q and his friends made for interesting dynamics, with both serious and entertaining moments... it didn't measure up to the first part of the book for me. The first quarter of the book propelled me through the last three-quarters, because I wanted to get back to Margo. I wanted to understand, solve the mystery, see the puzzle put together. Which, I suppose was the point, and what Q was feeling, thus what I was supposed to be feeling, but I still found that a little disappointing. I really prefer books where the journey to solve the mystery is as enjoyable as actually solving it, and in that aspect I, personally, was disappointed.<br /><br />The characters were mostly believable, and developed well (and appropriately to their characters) over the course of the book. Though I felt like Margo was a bit... beyond the typical high-schooler, I suppose it's not out of the realm of possibility. And I think the ending was appropriate to the characters.<br /><br />If you're looking for a light, easy, and entertaining escape from real life where everything's neatly wrapped up and everyone gets their happily ever after and you just come away with warm fuzzy happy feelings... this isn't the book for you. If you're looking for a book that reflects real life, and will take you on a journey of critiquing how you see the other people in your life... this is a good read.<br /><br />And as a side note, I do think it speaks to John Green's talent that he's able to explore deep topics of human existence and interaction in the moderately lighthearted ways that he does. I think I'll be reading more of his stuff.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|It was one of those stories that you just can't wait<br />to read the next page. I loved it. It was easy to picture<br />the different characters in my mind. The main characters<br />were such good people,which made me want to read on and<br />make sure they did indeed finally have good things happen<br />to them.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I enjoyed Cheryl's journey to find her inner self and to reconcile the loss in her life through the learnings, adventures, hardships, and people she met on the PCT. I felt her pain, the heat, her thirst and the dust from the trail. She crafted a story that made the difficulty of this journey real on a physical and emotional level. This is Cheryl's story and I thank her for sharing it.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|The story is incredibly well written. Some of the content was difficult for me, not to read or understand, but to accept. Perhaps that is why I couldn't stop reading, hoping the story would not turn traumatic. The ending for me was somewhat anticlimactic. I'm not sure what I wanted, but the ending did not bring closure to the story for me. Enjoy the story as a warning of what not to want.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|WORTH every penny!  The images are clear and appealing. You can wake up to your own music or the traditional sound of an alarm clock.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|This novel ticked all my boxes, war time London, mystery and never sure where it was heading<br /><br />I look forward to reading more of Kate's books
159463176X|3.0|I enjoyed it; but it lost me of who the story was about most of the time.  The ending was pretty clear.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Dont know how to review it since it won't give me all the features<br />until i rate it with 5 stars
0316286850|5.0|This book is cocktail table size. Beautiful photographs and great information.The book is laid out well and is easy to follow. A great book to add to any collection especially those interested in makeup. The before and after photographs are amazing.
B00006IXEE|1.0|buying a copy of footloose region 2 didnt work at all i have 2 ps3's a home theater and it would not play on any device i owned....
0446581356|5.0|A wonderful makeup book for anyone from beginner to expert. It has so much information about makeup, tools,techniques,and maintenance. It answers questions on how long you should keep makeup, and how to maintain and clean brushes. It also addresses how lifestyle affects your skin.It covers career options and stocking a professional kit. It has too many tips and step by step pictures to mention.It also covers topics like makeup for photography,magazines,shows,and bridal.
1603427244|5.0|I am pretty new to knitting, but this was a recommended book.  The greatest thing about this book is that the inside and outside covers list the stitch patterns you would need to use for different purposes.  It gives you Cast Ons for all-purpose, for ribbing (moderate stretch and a lot of stretch), for end-of-row, for super stretchy, for decorative, for temporary and hems, for toe-up socks and for circular.  It gives Bind Offs for all-purpose, for lace, for decorative, for stretchy ribbed and for specific use. The instructions and illustrations are great. It is also spiral-bound, which is helpful while you are knitting.  I would highly recommend this book, and I am sure I will use it more often as I get into more complicated patterns and further into my knitting.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I loved it, it was really well done. watched it for date night :) though I like movies like this so that's my opinion.
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|If your like me and have a nin collection then you should buy this album. But if your a banwagener then you shouldnt bother. Its very quiet and peaceful, wich is new for trent.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was an easy read. Definitely makes you aware of everything and everyone around you. Makes the imagination run wild !!!!
B00F91H666|2.0|The book is much more interesting. This film is just another zombie flick that follows the formula. The only exception is that the characters have more control because they are backed by military so all the extraordinary circumstances come with unrealistic assistance...It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't anything new and it bastardizes the source in a massively stupid way. Just rename it and call it a day.
B009O2XY12|1.0|Was trying to find a similar game to Bubble World. This game did not fit the bill. Annoying sound, music & graphics.
B00BUKODDO|5.0|I saw Gary Burton's group in Rotterdam NV two years ago as they toured the Common Ground release and was blown away then.  This was truly virtuoso level talent supporting insightful, creative and complex writing. The band here delivers a perfect follow up to that fantastic album with Guided Tour and it is a must for jazz enthusiast.<br /><br />Get both and play them back to back, repeat over and over.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Man... So much to say. This is beyond awesome. Alter Bridge has truly stepped up their game on this record.<br />Sound is phenomenal, songs are more aggressive, vocals are angelic...<br /><br />This is by far the album of the year..<br />[[ASIN:B00EDOS6IC Fortress]]
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite Gladwell books. It's not a subject that I had ever given much thought to before, but now I can't get it off my mind. The examples Gladwell uses to make his point were, as always, diverse and interesting. I highly recommend!
B008B68IEA|4.0|Cute idea, though the bed isn't long enough for the dolls. Well priced. Now I need to find a house.
B007DJUO8O|5.0|The songs here float on in an almost dream like manner moving with grace and subtlety. You have to commend these two on coming together to create an album that is such a departure from what they are known for and still be cohesive and powerful.
0785814531|5.0|can one say about Poe.<br /><br />However this volume is fantastic!<br /><br />I thought that I might have to pay $50 for a<br />book like this.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app makes it a lot easier for me to talk to my friends. I really love this app but it won't even let me log in. It says it's taking too long to load nd that I should try later. I've been trying to log in for days and its not my Internet connection this app doesn't work anywhere I go. Please fix this!!!! :)
B00CATSONE|4.0|There are many books on the genius of Nikola Tesla, but this one attempts<br />to define what sets the genius apart from other more ordinary thinkers.<br /><br />We may never know what Tesla really accomplished, but he certainly<br />left his mark on modern technology. One thing is for certain; he definitely<br />marched to a different drummer.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|This was a birthday gift for a Dr. Who fan, although he loved it, I was disappointed when a piece fell off within fifteen mins of taking it out of the package. We repaired it with some southern engineering but I will definitely think twice before ordering anything like this again.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I received my Chromecast. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I'm not impressed with what's offered or what it can do. Apple TV has it beat by a mile. Hopefully there will be enhancements in the future.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this Bible app all the time, if I need to reference a Bible verse, it is a very handy reference tool.  I love the ease of use; I can find a chapter quickly and get to the verse just as fast!  This was an awesome discovery!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me: Minion Rush<br />Love it! Even have it installed on my phone for my 3yr old to play.. no complaints
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|I have nothing to complain about in the movie..<br />have too many issues with the streaming on amazon prime.<br />Regret trying out prime.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|not user friendly would not load wanted me to sign  in then stopped tried it several times then gave up
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|A very enjoyable movie. You don't who's doing it to who. plot twists are great. bet the book was great as well.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I used mine for my Bible when I don't have it with me. Now it doesn't work. Don't like the fact when my savior gives me a scripture I can't look it up from the Bible I paid for.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A lot of fun. I hope the new levels are going to be ready soon!<br /> It's very addictive and makes you think a little.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Had to watch without grands in the room! But, the violence made sense within the context of the movie! I liked it, but do not share with Kids!<br />Steven A.
B000NA1OXY|3.0|I expected a brand new product, but it was only repackaged as new. I probably won't be buying from this seller again. I would have been more satisfied if it said &#34;Like New&#34; instead of &#34;New&#34;
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use this app a lot it's easy to use and I can find anything I need. I never have been disappointed
B004FGMV0W|3.0|The CD is scratch-less, but the booklet looks bad. It was stapled in a manner that it looks ugly and used. I expected much more from a product that says &#34;New&#34;
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|really great! songs mstch together, and you can turn it higher and faster,or lower and slower. check out gavin degraw soldier!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that everyone should play this game. Even though it may cost a little it is very fun. But beware if you are used to the computer version you need to make due with changes in this game.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I mean, I was skeptical at first, as you should be about an alarm clock, but it actually works. Trust me it's legit.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Liam McIntyre is brilliant as Spartacus!<br />This season will have you jumping out of your seat. Great writing and superb acting. The gladiators were not bad to look at. It will definitely leave you wanting more. Guaranteed!!!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I ike hidden object games and this was one of the better ones. The storyline was well done and the graphics excellent. I look forward to more games like this.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|this works well. if it crashes , which happens sometimes just restart it.<br />so far played anything i throwed at it. no staggeing issues.. i use dual band router with 300 Mbps.
B0089LOG02|5.0|this is compelling. It is so well written, covering one child and then back and forth that it never becomes boring. Winding together is unbelievable but that is ok.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A wonderful love story from the very beginning to the end.  I like that the characters were real through out very unusual circumstances.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|easy to set up and get things going. I like the alarm sounds and the live weather is a really cool feature!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I wish I knew about these with my first child! These are great!! No more pacifiers falling under tables or the couch. My son can find it, grab it and put it in his mouth all on his own. Also more of a comfort than just a regular pacifier since he can hold it. Love all the animal options. We have 2!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Great concept with an unusual twist. Had me going all the way to the end. It was even ok for my toddler to watch.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I found this book to be a wonderfully entertaining read with well thought out characters and an intriguing plot.  At times I couldn't put the book down eagerly reading onwards to unravel the next part of the storyline.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I wanted to add my voice to say that this is a lovely little gem of a movie. The actors are perfect for their roles, the soundtrack is great, and the coming-of-age story feels authentic and raw thru the whimsy. This is a movie that I can watch over and over without tiring of it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I loved it, very funny and easy read. I had a great time reading this and would recommend it to anyone.
B00125WAWS|5.0|Saw at the theater and purchased.  All kids should strive to be great spellers. Kick ebonics and texting to the curve.

B00BPDR3F6|5.0|It's obvious that Elizabeth Gilbert best known for her \\"first eat good food, then find a good guru, then find a good boyfriend,\\" book of recovery is going in a different direction with her latest. The Signature of All Things is a long, astonishingly researched historical about extreme individuals who do extreme things against a backdrop of wealth and - botany!  Think moss.  I don't mean to sound snarky because this epic novel took talent and hard work and a huge leap of faith to produce.  Some of the language is exquisite:  \\"She felt a deep bruise of absence for her father.\\" is a sentence that could only come from a writer that is giving us her best.  First I thought well, Elizabeth is writing a fabulous story of deprivation and wealth and plant life as a sound and grand metaphor for life.  If I'm smart enough, I'll get it.<br /><br />A serious look into 1800's Philadelphia grandeur is not what I was expecting from Gilbert.  Is this good or bad?  I don't know.  The beginning of this book is a quick set-up of the type that Jeffrey Archer did in Kane and Abel - very poor boy gets a foothold into a life that catapults him through happenstance, suffering and cunning into untold riches and power. That's okay with me.  I like a story that moves along as long as I care about the eventual outcome.  Once fame and fortune are accomplished, the storytelling slows down to introduce the real main character, Alma, a gifted brainiac, raised by the tiger mother of all tiger mothers. This tiger permits no frivolities, not even unkind thoughts. She instills an ethic of hard work that defines her daughter's life.  At times it consumes her life.<br /><br />Is it a love story?  Yes, but not in any ordinary sense.  Gilbert is going for transcendence.  Transcendence but still on earth - now it is clear why we have entered a religious order where plants lead us to the altar of the most high. And about that moss - Alma got me to fall in love with moss and Moss Time.<br /><br />I had the benefit of reading a lengthy profile of the author in the New York Times Magazine that spoke of Gilbert's process to settle on this project and her research for it.  It did not prepare me for Alma, the main character. Alma's emotions and ambitions and rigidity are not usual in popular fiction. Yet the outcome of her arduous journey to self-knowledge rings true and satisfies.<br /><br />Is this a compelling book - one that you must read to the finish?  Yes.

0486406482|3.0|I don't enjoy reading Jane Austen at this point in my life.<br /><br />Maybe some of you will, but I found it to be laborious. It was an easy read, but I simply find the time period of the book to be disagreeable. Perhaps, I missed the boat, since this text is supposed to be about Austen/Woodhouse bucking the social norm. I find Austen's social commentary dull, but insightful.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|... but it is just good fun and<br />silly and the stuff of a smile....<br />It is hard to even find a card that can do that!<br />for twenty minutes!<br /><br />Plus its starts the conversation for the phone<br />call visit...  What's not to like with a cast like this<br />even if the plot is as thin as low fat, low sodium<br />soup.... Who cares!...its good for the soul!
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book was carrying on at a good place, but came to a very rushed conclusion.  Will be interesting to see the conclusion.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I've been a fan of korn since the release of their first album, and always have been since then. This new album is the shitnezz, if your a true fan then get this cd!! Like right now!!
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Just could not really get into it. Not compelling - easy read though.  At times, it seemed a bit contrived.
B000W4HIX6|5.0|Many years from now, perhaps only 50 movies will rank as the top action thrillers.  This will be one of them.
1906735875|5.0|Honestly, I was taken back a bit on how much political satire is in this early material. Despite that, it's good fun and very entertaining.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Google Chromecast is GREAT!!!!  It is simple plug and play.  The setup is a breeze and you can be watching video within minutes.  I can use my smartphone or table to control on my TV.  I would recommend this to all my friends and family.
B00FN8HS5O|5.0|Just saw the movie and one of the things I noticed most was the music. Usually that's not such a good thing, but in this case it definitely is. Really good stuff.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|There's no way to watch these movies &#34;too many&#34; times. Can't wait for the third installment. Tarantino never made a bad movie.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The Piano Guys are amazing, and like the first cd, this one doesnt disappoint. Looking forward to what they come out with next.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I could not put this book down, the detail in the writing is amazing. I could picture everything!  It captured me
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought this because I have a new T,V, in my bedroom.  Unfortunately, it is not a smart T.V., which means it would not be able to pick up a a WiFi signal from my wireless router downstairs. I thought this was a logical solution to being able to view movies on Netflix and get my e mails upstairs.  I guess I must have misunderstood the applications this little device handles.  As far as I can tell, you can't surf the internet, but you can get streaming video from Netflix.  So, I get to watch the movies and shows I want, but dont' get the rest of the other stuff I would have liked.  I'm hoping that in future Googlel will be able to update the software on this device so I can get the full functionality I wanted.  But really, for just $35 it really is still a very good deal for those of us who like ot binge-watch shows.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I never expected to like this book so much and I truly never expected to laugh as much as I did! The writing was superb and I fell in love with all of the characters. John Green has a way of expressing the thoughts, fears, struggles and triumphs of those who suffer in a way that doesn't elicit pity, but best wishes in dealing with the illness. Living with it, not dying from it.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Purchased and it is wonderful clock app, but I am sick and tired of nag dialogs for thier other products.  I purchase apps to avoid nags and ads not get bombed with this stuff.  Other than that this is probably the best clock/alarm clock out there.

B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I started watching last season on PBS - loved it and wanted to watch the previous seasons.  2 of my daughters also wanted to watch from the start so I ordered season 1 and eventually season 2.  Borrowed season 3.  We have practically watched non-stop for the past month of weekends.  Can't wait until season 4 airs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game!  Very addictive.  I need more bananas!!  Vector must die.  Keep updating with fresh content, it's a keeper.  Download it and give it a try.
B000FC13UE|5.0|Neil Gaiman has long been one of my favorite authors. I started off reading his Sandman graphic novel series, and was hooked ever since. His short stories have quickly become some of my favorites of his writing. Being able to quickly devour story after story from Gaiman is a real treat, and his stories rarely disappoint. These shorts are eerie and thought-provoking, from tales of an ancient caretaker at a hotel to a few Lovecraftian tales to a story of a sly Fox masquerading as an innocent girl, the collection is jammed-packed with Gaiman's unique stories and humor.
030758836X|5.0|I was feeling pretty good about myself because I figured out the major twist that comes in about halfway through the novel. But surprise! I didn't see the end coming *at all.* I should have seem it, though: Flynn plays fair with her readers and gives us everything we need to piece it all together; I just missed the clues on the first read.<br /><br />In short, Gone Girl kept me riveted to the end with its incredible twists and flawed but compelling characters. A near-perfect thriller.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I ordered a replacement cord for my kindle Fire HD and a different item came ...but the item that did come will work for the Wii /USB so I will keep it
0307341550|4.0|As first novels go, this is one impressive debut.<br /><br />Like a lot of people who were introduced to Gillian Flynn through [[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl l]], I'm reading her books a bit out of order. This is Flynn's first novel, but it's the second of hers that I've read. Good news: It doesn't read like a first novel.<br /><br />Sharp Objects is creepy in the best sense of the word, a mix of Stephen King and V.C. Andrews with some crime thriller elements tossed in. In theory it's a \\"whodunit\\" style story, but the who is never particularly difficult to guess and the why is similarly telegraphed. So if this were just a mystery, it wouldn't deliver much.<br /><br />It's more than that, though: It's really a study of a very, very messed up family; and there's a bit of exploration into the seedy underbelly of small town America as well.<br /><br />A great thriller, well told. I'm really looking forward to [[ASIN:0307341577 Dark Places ]] next!
B008478VE8|5.0|if you havent read this book by now then you havent been aware of the world around you! this is a bible of the modern age
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I really enjoy playing but have a few issues.  First, the cards are too small and the bingo is too close to the bottom numbers so I accidentally hit it regularly and card is dead.  Not enough wins to earn bingo tokens so can only play a few minutes a day.  The daily tournament requires way high scores to really win anything. Otherwise love the speed and look of the game.  I will continue to play my 5 minutes or so of free game play a day.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I felt this sequel was well thought out and did not sugar coat Dan's life, proving there is no \\"happily ever after\\".
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|They might have tried to stick more to the basic draw for the fan base with the presentation. It was funny, but not Hangover funny.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|While I do wish there were a cinematic representation of the book, which this is not, that is not why I rated this movie so poorly.  Let's begin:<br /><br />1)Crappy production value on par with B zombie movies I watch on Netflix.<br /><br />2)The whole zombie outbreak makes no sense.  In most zombie movies, that's not really a problem; why do zombies need to make sense?  However, when much of the movie hinges on a scientific explanation of said zombie outbreak, then it should make some sense.  SPOILER ALERT: Basically if you are sick or ever have been, you shouldn't get the zombie infection.  The WHO scientists say that the zombie disease detects the antibodies of diseases, so really anything will do.  Brad Pitt tests the theory with H1N1.  The freakin' flu!  So anybody with a sniffle should not have been affected.<br /><br />3)Brad Pitt.  I'm not a huge fan of his, though I enjoy some of his roles. I think he is great at physical roles like Fight Club or comedic ones like Burn After Reading or Inglorious Bastards.  Otherwise, he's paid lots o' money to make a pouty face and squint at the camera, and that's pretty much all you get out of him.<br /><br />4)The UN.  Brad Pitt's character is some UN guy sent to figure out zombies.  Why?  Who is he?  You never find out.  Also, how often does the UN solve anything?  They send him on the mission with the one scientist guy who has some idea of how to fight the disease, but does he write his ideas down on a post-it before he snuffs it?  Nope, just sort of crazily spews it to Brad Pitt on a plane.  WTF?<br /><br />5)Everybody is completely stupid.  Just watch it. You'll see.  Or don't.  Just make sure you get somebody else to pay the rental fee.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I'm too hyped up from the read to focus on this review, I NEED the next book NOW! It was incredible.
B00E34A9FU|4.0|The Dead's typical set list from the period, maybe, but, no debate, it's a gig where everything flows as sweetly as what looks like that gorgeous summer day in Oregon. It really shows them in their natural habitat. But standing out of the pack are the strongest versions of \\"Me and My Uncle\\" and \\"China Cat Sunflower > I Know You Rider\\" that I've ever heard. \\"Sugar Magnolia\\" swings as it builds in its intensity and on this they even outperform their \\"Europe '72\\" version which I've always thought was definitive. This also contains a dramatically revised \\"Bird Song\\" which trounces Jerry's studio job as well as the live version I have on \\"Three from the Vault\\". The Garcia-Lesh-Weir interplay here packs a lot more blues in the jam without it ever dragging or being overpowering. It's a neat trick to achieve. They're right at home when covering \\"Sing Me Back Home\\". Jerry's mellow guitar solo with his innate melancholy voice is the perfect touch. And much beauty and transcendence are found in his (and their) voices. The DVD portion, in which only some of the concert is shown, succeeds in revealing an audience's freedom slotting in naturally with the Dead's cool stage presence. Rarely in music has a band and audience ever blended as one in just doing their thing. I'm sure glad the diehards clamored for this concert's rehabilitation. I can't stop hearing and watching it.
B00E9PMMPI|4.0|Just viewed my new copy of Fantastic Voyage. I have loved this movie since it premiered back in 1966. Has been second to 2001 as my favorite films. Anyway, I have owned this film in every conceivable format since the dawn of home video, and I can say that this is the best it has looked since I remember it on the big screen, but there is still the nagging color fluctuation (over saturation in bursts) during the beginning of the \\"refilling of the air tanks\\" sequence. It has been toned down a bit more than the laser disc and VHS editions, but actually the 2nd DVD (special edition) version was the best (or least saturated). Picture is very crisp and colors are good (except as mentioned above). They have also re-instated the correct opening text (\\"You're about to see things...).<br /><br />They did leave off some of the DVD supplements (behind the scenes gallery, prop photos, EPK), which means that I need to retain the Special Edition as well.
B003O86FMW|4.0|When I read the first book, I can't say I was very impressed. The games itself was interesting but didn't feel like a deep story to keep coming back to a sequel. But then this second book also has the games, but then it's much more than just the games and it an amazing build up to the final book. Which I'm yet to read.<br /><br />I think any one reading the book should consider this more like a Lord of the rings Trilogy where the story is compete only after all 3 books are read. I'm already excited about reading the third.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|Not a fan. I deleted it within a week. Im back with the lesser of 2 evils! I do not want to add more words to this.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a good read. It kept me entertained and the message was clear. I recommend it to any one
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is one of those books that you can't put down and yet you don't want it to end. The two main characters have some similarities but yet very different. The Orphan Train makes one interested in reading other books on the subject.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Simple idea, well executed.<br /><br />In each level you connect 3 or more of the same tile type. You need to connect once (or twice, with special spaces) over a space to turn it blue. Once all the tiles are blue, a piece of the talisman appears at the top, and you have to get it to the bottom before the timer runs out.<br /><br />Definitely worth a purchase.
B003EVWDR0|1.0|The story line on this is lame. &#34;up &#34; has a better story line. My husband didn't realize there was a charge for this. If he would have realized they charged for this movie he would not have watched. It was a $13.00 charge even with prime.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|At first I bought my Chromecast as a toy to show off here and there, but as they updated it and as I had more friends swing by the place, I found out how useful it is.<br /><br />First, it's quicker than turning on my ps3 to watch HuluPlus or NetFlix.<br /><br />The big one though is Youtube.  And yeah, everything can do youtube.  But there is a level of convenience here that is outstanding.<br /><br />Friends come by, everyone logs into your wifi on their phones, tablets, even laptops, and we can all share the same queue instantly on youtube. everyone can pause/skip. And suddenly you've accidentally started a youtube party.  It's a lot more convenient than the pairing process that leanback and ps3/360/roku have since your wifi password is fine.<br /><br />Even if a PC or laptop logs into your wifi the youtube website has chromecast options built into it.<br /><br />But anyway, after watching every Epic Rap Battles of History video there is and an assortment of anime music videos 2 of the 5 people who came by my house have already said they're buying a chromecast too.<br /><br />As the owner of a smart-TV, I prefer the chromecast over any of the TVs build in functions. So it can also be thought of as a super easy way to turn any TV in to a smart TV.<br /><br />I did have to plug in the USB power but that wasn't much of an inconvenience.
B002APU580|4.0|A beautifully made film. Transports the viewer to another time and place. Passionate and delightful performances by all the actors.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|this is a good book if you are looking for a nice simple book that is an easy read. A little bit of a tear jerker.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I am taking financial planning courses.  This is a required tool for the classes and it meets all my expectations.  A classic calculator with much functionality.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|good book.  Very confusing at first with all the different characters and different parts of Australia they live in.  After a while I did get to know everyone and then I couldn't put the book down.  The very end is the best part so read every last page!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good for kids to enjoy  and quite challenging once you get further into the game and that's all I got to say
B008MM9630|3.0|This game is so hard to understand. They don't tell you how to do any of the quest. The only thing good about this game is you can revive your plants.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|Honestly i was expecting something cheap because that is how everything is these days. I was pleasently surprised when i got this. Good quality, durable, does exactly what it needs to do.
B00E7SXRHY|1.0|I already own several other copies of this on vinyl and CD, and this latest version adds nothing. In my opinion, the most interesting new offerings on In Utero are the Albini alternate 2013 mixes and, to a lesser degree, the bonus tracks, all of which most devoted fans already had except for maybe \\"Forgotten Tune\\" and the instrumentals.<br /><br />This set is well-packaged and on heavyweight vinyl, but I find the double 45RPM LP thing really annoying, breaking up the continuity of the record and, of course, making this package more expensive. Again, I feel the vinyl version lacks some of the more interesting offerings packaged with the CD version, which I also own. Compared to the Nevermind 20th Anniversary Vinyl Edition (which included the full alternate mix of the album), the In Utero one feels much more like a crass repackaging offering even the hardcore fan little in return. This \\"remaster\\" (which is different than the 2013 alternate mixes) does not sound much different, to me (whereas the alternate mixes are very different, strikingly so in some cases).<br /><br />I would encourage fans, or new people looking to get into Nirvana on vinyl, to buy any the normal 33 1/3 versions of the record on vinyl, and if you want the bonus items, buy the CD version.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Four individual magicians each with their individual talents are harnessed together as a team calling themselves the four horsemen. They pull off an outrageous bank heist to start a series of world with impossible stunts. It this leading up to a grand finally or are they just modern day Robin Hoods?<br />We go along for the ride as speculation abounds.<br /><br />We are always used to the last one you would expect scenario and this film may take it to the extreme.<br /><br />The film has a great case including Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley whom seems to mysteriously second guess everyone.<br /><br />After watching it the first time to get the story, watch it again for the nuances.<br /><br />The extras are probably not worth watching as they were left off the version I watched.
B00E88YNJY|5.0|Great music, the whole album. All songs are perfectly put together.  Definitely glad I purchased it.  Good addition to my music collection.
B005TVYVI2|1.0|I bought and used this.  Had the basic model which still works and is better, notwithstanding the fact that the battery can't be changed.  The Pro version fades and shuts off, won't stay on and this is not a battery issue.  It's great if Finis fixed the issue, but who wants to pay for it again?!

1476727651|5.0|Fans of King and those who want to know more about what happened to little Danny Torrance after the events at the Overlook Hotel will not want to miss this. It's clearly one of Steve's best works of recent years, with an almost unimaginably terrible villain, another of his signature child characters, and a chain of events that will keep readers glued to the book to the last page. Constant Readers will find a bunch of `Easter Eggs' - the generous references to other characters or places in the King universe. But, above all, this is King at his finest - relating the tale of one man's struggle to find a place to stand, a young girl's fight against unyielding evil - and returning to his eternal themes of hope and redemption.<br /><br />Rocky Wood - author of 'Stephen King: A Literary Companion'
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|UPDATE- October 13, 2013:<br /><br />  Only 3 or 4 days after submitting a very brief report, (Scroll down to read my original review if you'd like to know how to do this) I'd decided to check the app again by simply downloading Mosaika from my Amazon Cloud and reinstalled it. Upon opening the game, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the color changing tree that is Fire Maple Games' logo. It was then that I knew the app had been fixed because all I could see was a black screen before.<br /><br />  So, if you cannot get Mosaika to even OPEN, or, you're having any other problems where you're unable to play the game, then I strongly suggest you try what I had. Then wait at least three to five days and download the app again. Mosaika is TOTALLY worth that effort and, is definitely worth the wait!!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: October 9, 2013:<br /><br />  I, too, have not been able to enjoy Fire Maple Games new point and click adventure app. Although I'm deeply disappointed about this, there is a right way and a wrong way to handle this problem. First, I'd like to start by saying: I personally  do not feel an app deserves just one star, simply because it fails to open properly on my device. There could be any number of reasons for this; many of them of which could be of absolutely no fault to the app or the developer of the app, itself. Therefore, I feel it's unfair to immediately place blame for something that could be a problem within my own device.<br /><br />  So what do I do? Well, I obviously can't rate a game I haven't been able to even see, either. So, I stay neutral, give 3 stars, then scroll down the page where it states: REPORT An Issue: Click on that, tap the reason for the issue ( in my case, I checked the crashing app issue). Then give a brief description of the problem and the device you are using. Then submit your report. Complaining here will NOT get you a refund from Amazon or Maple Fire Games. (You'll need to call Amazon's customer service for that.)<br /><br />  If you can contact Maple Fire Games through email or on Facebook, etc., you might have better luck that way. In the meantime, those, like myself, who are unable to play Mosaika, be patient. I'm hoping they're working on a fix already and that will take a little time. =))<br /><br />  If you can contact Maple Fire Games through email or on Facebook, etc., you might have better luck that way.

B00AB65SVE|5.0|I just love Modern family. Its a show that is not afraid to show what American families truly look like and break down the stereotypical traditional family roles. It keeps you laughing too!
B00E03ULJS|3.0|If you are looking for new bubblegum dubstep tracks that made Krewella catchy you will not find any. Is that a good thing or bad thing? That's up to you to decide, but what you will find here is progressive. Pretty bad progressive indeed, like literally bad.<br /><br />Like many acts going mainstream you have to ride wave and that wave is called pop progressive house. We might never find out why they went that route, was it voluntarily or they were pressured into doing it but that would not matter if the actual music was good. Instead they gave us bunch of fillers to support their actual already known biggest hits to date, you know that \\"outdated\\" dubstep beat with a smudge of Krewella glitch glitter.<br /><br />I will not go into discussing their previous material but rather new, fresh tracks. New tracks offer quite few different sounds but they all fall flat and pretty much have the same cons. Progression is not really interesting and feels very stale, choruses are not distinguished enough from the verses to make you wait for them and bridges are weak. Progressive leads are bit better but once again nothing unheard of. When they want to hit it hard with progressive sound and beats they compress it like its dubstep and kill all the dynamic range, can't remember the name of the song but when you hear it you will know what I am talking about. Then they tried to do something like Seven Lions on track called \\"Human\\" but that is so hard to pull of right and its really no surprise that it didn't work. Then we have some pop drum'n'bass a la DJ Fresh which is really not that exciting. And then we have some unplugged track which makes no sense what so ever.<br /><br />When its all said and done you will most likely have fun going through the compilation once or twice just don't expect Hardwell type of quality if you are into progressive or if you bought this because of it. If you are the oldschool Krewella fan there is nothing to be disappointed you can still catch them live and relive all your Play Hard wet dreams.<br /><br />The reason why I can't call this an album is because it doesn't sound as one, to me it sounds like an introductionary mix tape with more on a mellow and clean side to get moar people aboard. It is quite obvious that white collars know what they are doing since the \\"album\\" has hit No.1 in US.<br /><br />So who am I to judge anything but if you would excuse me now I am going to put on Bonfire sprinkled with Krewella magic and listen to what I think Krewella is the best at: dirty thin beats, high pitch pollution and energy spill drops to make your brain super messy.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is a master storyteller, pure and simple. I enjoy his poking fun at people who are puffed up with their own imagined importance. This book caught me unaware when Malcolm/Max began his complicated plan to outwit the government people trying to keep tabs on him. The same government responsible for convicting him of a crime he didn't commit. I was expecting to read about his descent into the witness protection program and running from bad guys. Instead the story took an 180 degree turn as he twisted, turned and conspired to a happy surprise ending. It was written so well that I rarely paid attention to the color of the characters.

B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Concentrating on your One Thing puts you miles ahead on your path to achieving what you want.  I've been reading books similar to this for decades, but this little book says it all.  I highly recommend The One Thing.
B008220BLG|5.0|This movie is like twilight but with zombies. It is not scary at all but is a twist on the zombie genre.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is an addictive game. I appreciate the length of the preview as I will buy the full version as soon as I get an Amazon card.
