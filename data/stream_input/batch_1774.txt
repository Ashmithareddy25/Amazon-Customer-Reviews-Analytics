B00005JKNF|5.0|My God, what a delight, I had tried many times in life to be a little like Maggie Smith playing one of these aristocrats
B007TK77QE|1.0|I was hoping to break my antipathy towards the Potter goddesses writing but no such luck! I found the first four chapters so hard-going that I have had to take a break to regain my strength...I may try to reread it when I feel I have nothing left to read in the world and/or lose the will to live ~ until then, I can manage to live with this drivel.
B000KJT8IG|4.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  I can't imagine going through the struggles that Clark Griswald did just to get the perfect tree and to bring joy to his diverse family.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This app is just great and very entertaining. My entire family loves playing this game. Awesome graphics, so many levels and very challenging. Well worth the dollar. Get it
B00448VST6|5.0|This honestly is one of my top movies. I love watching it, the direction is completely new which i love and still makes you feel like you're in a game from the 1990's. Its so great and the jokes are hilarious, i feel like everyone should watch this atleast once.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|GREAT heartfelt movie. Twists and turns you don't expect. Could watch it every day and not tire of it. Love the song, &#34;If I had Words&#34; ... brings a tear every time!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|this book is amazing it helps me read before i go to sleep when suzzane finishes a chapter she leaves u hanging and it is something to think about
B0085RQLXK|4.0|Chances are you won't like every track on this album.  I sure don't.  But chances are you will really like at least a few.  &#34;Legendary Child&#34; even made this year's &#34;Top 1043 Classic Rock songs&#34; list by NY station Q104.3.  That's quite impressive for a song that just came out.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|One of my faves for 2012. Same Love is soul searching, and beautiful. Several other hits - a great listen!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|So far season 3 has been pretty awsome. one episode was a little dull, but it was building story. Great season so far, better every episode. If you havent seen the other seasons. watch em! They are awesome and addictive. Recommend to any zombie fan, or any person that wants a great show, with great drama and ZOMBIES!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Easy to use and the price is right. Could use an adding machine mode. The best feature is the large display and keys.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome book<br />Would like for her to make a book in just his view like how she gave us a sample that would be very interesting
B000FC1HBY|4.0|Love the ongoing Saga - skip over the excessive details - fully engaged with characters & story line. HBO did great job with adaptation.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazing couldn't wait to read the next one<br />Couldn't put the book down didn't take me long to read :)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|HBO introduced me - the book captivated me! Martin creates a culture and world that is unique. The characters are both heroic & villainous - no one has the monopoly on virtue. (Although some seem thoroughly vile!) HBO did an excellent adaptation.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Protects my iPhone better than any other case I've ever had. Also, if anything happens to your case, the company is awesome at replacing it hassle-free.
0385344228|4.0|My book group suggested Defending Jacob and found it to be very interesting and worth our time.  Some of the events mirror news stories of today.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|A first rate, hard hitting TV show.  All you have to do is to watch it once. You will either stick around for the whole series, or never watch it again. No in between here. The show is considered fiction, but is also a fact of todays life. The situation is a bit overdone to make a point and it does!! You find out that good people can do &#34;bad&#34; things and it allows you into a world you might not ever see otherwise. It shows the audience both sides of a very controversial subject.<br /><br />Can it happen?  Yes!!!  Does it happen?  Yes!!!  See for yourself; decide for yourself and learn to understand the many sides of life that so many people go through.  Watch this with open eyes and you will find yourself immersed in the life of Walt and his &#34;family.&#34;<br /><br />I don't miss it.  If I can't see it when it is on, I tape it to watch later. It is gripping, fascinating, and keeps my attention glued to the TV for a fast passing one hour of breathtaking story. I highly recommend it for anyone who likes to watch  an action packed, controversial show that continues each week with more!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The book is excellent.  It's a great story of what kind of a pioneer Steve Jobs was (and what an SOB he was, as well).

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I'd never read any (or even heard of) George RR Martin until my son recommended them out to me.  If you like ADULT fantasy, read the entire series.  I'm eagerly waiting for #6.  (C'mon George...what's the hold up???????).  But by the time it gets here I may have to read them all over again to remember all that preceded it!
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|It is an ok book. Not the best and not the worst closer the bests probably. Would recommend it to someone.
B003P2WJ6S|4.0|skloot manages to interweave scientific data with a touching personal story in a realistic yet heartwarming and interesting style.  not only does the layman manage to understand and learn the story of cells, but she raises a range of questions about ethical problems which leave one pondering.  switching between the different aspects of the story, she maintains our interest in both the family [giving a vivid portrayal of a native american family's world] and the scientific aspects of cell production - whether from the court. various scientists' or the man in the street's point of view.  well researched, yet easy to read and absorb
B00846REIS|4.0|This book is a good starter for the Crossfire Novel's.  I would recommend if you liked the Fifty Shades of Grey.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|American's Idols best and most different artist yet.  I 'm older so it is not a crush piece. Pure talent was judged right this time.  Not a voice like everyone else.  He owns it I can only hope to see him in concert someday.  Invest wisely and you will see his unique sound like no other and he does it so easily.  One of a kind. Will certainly last and I see awards coming his way
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book is a good sequel to the BARED TO YOU. Make you want to read more books in the Crossfire Novels.

0374214913|3.0|Penumbra has a great setup, and the author is obviously a talented \\"idea guy\\" (in silicon valley speak). The first third of the book draws you into its mystery in the same way that the titular bookstore draws in its special brand of late night visitors. Sloan's rich descriptions of places and objects make you want to visit the store, climb through the vertical stacks, and touch crumbly leather-bound volumes. The premise is familiar, but no less welcome: ordinary people, secrets hidden in plain view and amongst everyday objects, the hidden fantastical underbelly of the mundane. It's hard not to love the sort of magic realism that's teased here.<br /><br />But, as with many books cemented in the fantasy genre, meaningful character development is all but missing. Characters often come off as one dimensional, arc-less, and in some cases, downright annoying. For example, the character of Kat, who seems to have been created just to provide a fill-in-the-blank love interest with geek cred, allowing the author to name drop far too many silicon valley buzzwords in an attempt to seem modern and relevant to a young adult audience. Valley startup culture is worshiped in this book like no other fiction that I've ever read or ever want to read again, and the overuse of tech terminology borders on the embarrassing. Ever watched an episode of NCIS where a \\"hacker\\" rattles off a string of unintelligible words that are all real things, but that don't quite make sense in the given context? That'll be a familiar sensation here. Yes, Ruby is a programming language. No, a neophyte would not use it to make a 3D model of a bookstore in an evening. Yes, I'm the guy that has to point that out. Sorry. Sometimes I post comments on Youtube too.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, Penumbra's ending is a bit rushed and sloppy, though I actually liked the big (and somewhat anti-climactic) reveal at the conclusion. It showed a surprising amount of heart for a book that seemed like it was destined to turn into one gigantic love letter to present and future Google executives. But maybe I read it all wrong. Maybe there's a secret code in there, hiding the real meaning of the whole thing...d to turn into one gigantic love letter to present and future Google executives. But maybe I read it all wrong.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|An interviewer once asked George Romero if he felt imprisoned as a director by the success of the &#34;Dead&#34; films. His response was, &#34;Yes, but it's a prison where I like the food....&#34;. In that spirit, Zombies/Georgia = Pecan Pie/French Vanilla Ice Cream! Terrific cast in a setting where you can almost feel the humidity and smell the dead.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I love Brandon Sanderson's books, and this one is no exception.  Unique, creative, though-provoking, intriguing characters.  Couldn't ask for anything more!
B0032KLAKE|5.0|This is a cat-and-mouse game which is unpredictable with brooding acting on Richard Gere's more sensitive role.  Edward Norton knocks it out of the ball park on a riveting portrayal of someone who may or equally may not be guilty of killing a Catholic priest who was up to no good.Edward Norton plays a lot of dark convoluted roles which show is native intellgence, articulation and discernment of the type of role that he would suit.  Richard Gere has a dark side here because we don't know exactly why he is defending Edward Norton.  With relatively little blood and guts, this film has you riveted all the way through.  It stands the test of time.  A=
B005PK553C|5.0|This is a terrific show.  Kept me on the very edge of my seat for every moment of every episode.  Am now watching Season 2: Asylum.  OH WOW!!!!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|When I ordered this, I expected that the entire cover (at least the outside) would be the same color. I ordered mine in pink, so expected that the entire case would be pink. Instead, the front cover is actually graphite. Now that I look at the photos, I can see that, but the main photo for this item is fairly misleading, I think. The image on the left side is actually the *back* of the case, which is an odd angle to take of the item. If I had realized that the case wasn't all pink, I would have just ordered the graphite. Enough about my color disappointment...<br /><br />This case is pretty great otherwise. It's super thin but strong. The device snaps in very easily. All of the controls, ports, and speakers are still accessible. It's easy to hold. The stand function works great.
0547884591|5.0|Where to start about Tim Ferris? Most great authors, and in his own way Tim Ferris is nothing if not a great author if effectiveness is any measure, have only one master work (or Magnum Opus) in them.<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B004M8S3Y6 The 4-Hour Body]] literally changed my life. After reading and DOING it I became a new person insofar as the part of my person-hood visible from the outside goes.<br /><br />As a life long learner, son of a Columbia University professor and novelist I left home at 14 and have been a self taught learner ever since.<br /><br />When I was 15 I worked at a Michelin rated restaurant as a sous chef. My culinary knowledge was hard won and something I have been very proud of ever since.<br /><br />The 4 Hour Chief puts anything I learned to shame and can do the same for you in 48 hours.<br /><br />Don't be fooled this book isn't a primary a book to teach you how to cook rather it is the manual that will teach you how to learn more effectively then you ever have. We all eat and love food, however the cooking lessons contained herein are just the hook. This manual will teach how to be more effective by teaching you how to think about doing whatever it is that you want to accomplish in the way of a formal skill or any number of informal ones that seem daunting to the uninitiated.<br /><br />Take the next step,Grasshopper. Buy this book. I suspect that a great many of you who do will be back to buy many more as Christmas presents.<br /><br />Those of you who read and follow what this book teaches you to learn will make the same improvements to the inside of your person-hoods as the [[ASIN:B004M8S3Y6 The 4-Hour Body]] will help you make to the outsides of your person-hoods.<br /><br />Thank you Tim.<br /><br />Etienne Taylor

B00A2FSXHK|4.0|Minority Report is a futuristic thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat from the get go. Tom Cruise delivers in the action department while the plot of the film is very unique and suspenseful. Watching the gesture-controlled computer system makes you so hungry for what future technology is going to be capable of. This movie is a must see.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Awesome movie. It shows true courage in the face of evil. It's an older movie but I think even teens would like it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The acting by all of the actors is superb ~ truly shows the diversity & perserverance of the human race to survive under &#34;extreme&#34; conditions!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger games is an amazing novel by my pal,.Suzzane Collins. This is the best novel in the hunger games trilogy, in my opinion, by far.  Original is the best!! I recommend this book for preteens or older.  It has some violent scenes that may be intense for some readers.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|The kids will love it. I sat down to watch with them and nothing to beat the story line.<br />Again one of the best tinker movies

B009IQ0TGM|1.0|I love how &#34;Lights&#34; starts off sort of quietly, pulling you in further.  She does have something to say.  I recently heard &#34;Anything Could Happen&#34; on VH1.  Love it as well!  Both songs are on &#34;Halcyon.&#34;

0385341008|4.0|Written as letters to and from main character Juliet, this delightful book allows us to take Juliet's path as she begins writing a new book about a German-occupied island during WWII. Wait a minute. Delightful and Nazi Germany don't mix. And yet the writer has managed just that. Once I started reading the book I just couldn't put it down.

0345525558|4.0|A mesmerizing, moving, and elegantly written debut novel, The Language of Flowers beautifully weaves past and present, creating a vivid portrait of an unforgettable woman whose gift for flowers helps her change the lives of others even as she struggles to overcome her own troubled past.<br /><br />The Victorian language of flowers was used to convey romantic expressions: honeysuckle for devotion, asters for patience, and red roses for love. But for Victoria Jones, it's been more useful in communicating grief, mistrust, and solitude. After a childhood spent in the foster-care system, she is unable to get close to anybody, and her only connection to the world is through flowers and their meanings.<br /><br />Now eighteen and emancipated from the system, Victoria has nowhere to go and sleeps in a public park, where she plants a small garden of her own. Soon a local florist discovers her talents, and Victoria realizes she has a gift for helping others through the flowers she chooses for them. But a mysterious vendor at the flower market has her questioning what's been missing in her life, and when she's forced to confront a painful secret from her past, she must decide whether it's worth risking everything for a second chance at happiness.
B007EDYN36|5.0|I found this book really great, much much much better than books of Ace and Gene. It can really catch you, I couldn't help myself, I couldn't stop reading it till the very end. So I believe it can be a VERY interesting reading for any real KISS fan. Buy this book now, you won't regret it.<br /><br />At the same time it shows Peter as a very weak and poor person you wouldn't want to work with even if your life depends on it. Even for tons of money :) If for example I would work with such a person, I'd kill myself. No woking ethics, no mind stability. Signing a contract and starting moaning and complaining about it on the same day - that's his style for the whole life. Money, drungs, women, alcohol, women, money, drugs and wonem again... oh man, your life was horrable. I'm soooo sorry for you :) Nobody would step in your shoes. Thanks for the book though, it's brilliant and a huge fun to read.
1455508977|3.0|Okay. Let's not kid ourselves. This is a Nicholas Sparks book. It's not amazing literature. But based on what it is, a good and easy read that honestly kept my attention, I'm giving this book three stars. (Only serious literature could possibly earn more.) If you have enjoyed any of the other Nicholas Sparks books (and let's face it, he's an institution for some) you will also enjoy this book.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The Life of Pi is an impossible story, but Pi made the impossible possible.  I loved the story and the telling of the story.
B000ETQPYM|1.0|I knew this was being made into a movie. And let's face it, when a book is made into a movie, the book is usually really good. But I just couldn't get into this book. In fact, I walked away after page 100. Doesn't mean someone else won't enjoy it. It just didn't capture me.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|Our book club read this book, and I loved it!  I can't even imagine having a ghost pestering me.  Oh, heck no!
0786553804|1.0|There's a reason I often don't read non-fiction story-telling books. But after hearing so much about this book, I thought.... why not? Because it's dry, boring, lecture-like, and I couldn't get past page 50. 'Nough said.
B0086DBE62|3.0|It was just okay. Tried to make it more a liberated version which I get for little girls to know they CAN do things for themselves...
0743298039|4.0|I ate this book up in one week... which is saying a lot considering I haven't read a complete book in the last six months. The Thirteenth Tale is a fun read that takes the reader on a journey of hidden family secrets and mysteries. Actually, the \\"theme\\" of it reminded me a lot of the book Rebecca. So if you liked this one, I would recommend picking up Rebecca as well.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|hilarious! and brilliant! must see for adults if not for kids. but my 4-year-old loves it too. great claymation visuals.
0345495004|1.0|After two months of slowly reading this book and reaching page 200 (halfway through the book) I realized that I could care less about what happens to the main characters. And if that isn't an indication of the book, I don't know what is.<br /><br />Another point.... even though it's based on real life people (Frank Lloyd Wright and a lover), that didn't even keep my interest. I would skip this one.... I've stopped reading it entirely.

B002WTC92E|4.0|Chasing Harry Winston is one of the better \\"chic lit\\" books I've read recently. Written by the author of \\"The Devil Wears Prada,\\" the story follows three woman on the verge of 30 whose lives are taking some unexpected turns. I wanted to follow the characters' stories, which is always a good indication of a strong writer. Was it a bit predictable? Did everything end up neatly tied up with a bow? Perhaps -- but isn't that true of all chic lit? In the end, it was a great beach I would easily recommend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is very similar to solitaire on a desktop computer.  Very enjoyable. I would recommend to my friends who have a Kindle Fire.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first heard of this book I was very reserved about reading it. I heard about it from my 12 year old sister and at 11 years younger than me I felt this book was below my reading standards and would bore me... I can say nothing that would lead you to this conclusion! I decided to read anyways and found myself enthralled and utterly glued to every word. This book took on a brand new story line unlike any I've read before. It captured the readers imagination and attention, I promise you won't want to put it down!
0156034026|1.0|I was expecting a consistent and persuasive account of how a Westernized young man can adopt (or rise to) fundamentalism. All I found is Hollywoodian run-of-the-mill  storyboard made to become a movie, and thus directly falls target to its own criticism of being driven by capitalist motives.<br /><br />Half the book is about the protagonist's professional life. Very detailed in the beginning (garduation from Princeton, job interview, etc) but sketchy and precipitated towards the end as the hero embraces fundamentalism.  The other half of the book is intertwined with the first one and describes his romantic -- and occasionally erotic -- relation with an American girl.  The mixture is not a happy one. I wish some repetitive romantic stretches were replaced by a better explanation of the fundamentalist motives.
B003ZHQVCQ|3.0|I bought this album in high hopes, being a great fan of Mirella Freni and Leo Nucci. Bruscantini I have slight reservations at this time of his career, and I want to hear the great fuss about Gosta Winbergh.<br />Unfortunately, this recording fails to provide fun and appropriate playfulness. Just as I feared, Sesto Bruscantini as Pasquale fails to provide weight or enough buffo to pull this off. He sounds so much lighter than Leo Nucci (Dr. Malatesta) that the only way to tell them apart is Pasquale has the lower notes. As for Nucci, his upper range is wonderful but his fioratura is very sluggish. Freni, one of my all-time favorite sopranos is terribly mis-cast. She can turn a phrase and be coy and demure, but lacks the agility and lightness in the upper register to make this soubrette role hers. At times the ensembles sound like early Verdi with her full lyric sound. She is, I must admit, no rival of Popp in the Wallberg recording in 1979.<br />Gosta Winbergh as Ernesto is the most suited to his role at this point in his career. He later moved into heavier repertoire but in 1984. His vocal timbre is dead on for the role of Ernesto, but in the higher range he has marked trouble with the tessitura's demands. In the famously difficult Act 2 scene of 'Povero Ernesto - Cerchero lontana terra', he struggled helplessly and landed on an octave low C sharp at the end of the aria.  He is, in short, not as good as Matthew Polenzani (with the low C sharp), nor as good as JDF (who has the high C sharp), and is way behind Alfredo Kraus and Francisco Araiza in this role (both with the absolutely sound high tessitura and drop dead beautiful C sharp to boot).
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The plot was good and kept my interest, BUT, unlike previous books, this one did not end well.  I turned the last page and said, this is it?  I felt something was left on the table...

0345803485|2.0|I live in fear of spoilers, so I never read reviews and I hardly ever even read an entire synopsis. I saw the entire series at the top of the bestseller list awhile back so I thought, why not? I was looking for a light read, like Twilight, which may not be my favorite book but it was entertaining. I heard it was fanfic from Twilight, so I assumed Christian Grey was a werewolf...<br /><br />Innocently I downloaded the book and began to read. I thought the writing was somewhat annoying, there was a little too much detail about what was going on in Ana's mind but she seemed like a strong, independent, smart woman. A bit stupid about boys but she seemed to be really holding out for the right one.<br /><br />And then she meets Christian Grey, your typical aloof mega-hottie that for some reason seems to be interested in this normal girl. You get that a lot in your average chick lit. There's a lot of that being sucked into his eyes ridiculousness that you get in Twilight, but I was entertained. I was rooting for them.<br /><br />So they're super into each other, but Christian is against it for some reason. Because he's a werewolf, I thought. Makes sense. He doesn't want to eat her or something on the full moon.<br /><br />Christian brings Ana back to his super nice Seattle pad, and since he's super rich, he needs her to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Of course he doesn't want her to tell the world he's a werewolf, right? Makes sense.<br /><br />And then he brings her to this room, to show her his secret. There are chains and weird things in it, and a really big, ornate bed in the center. OF COURSE, I thought, because he's a werewolf. He needs to get chained up once a month.<br />Christian Grey is not a werewolf. And he wants Ana to sign a freaking contract so she can be his sex slave and get chained up whenever he wants. In the contract it specifies how she can dress, what she can eat, how often she has to work out and how often he expects her to come over whenever he wants her to.<br /><br />And here's the thing, she was not into that. And she didn't seem to like being tied up while they had sex. She wanted to be able to touch him and see him. So I assumed the book might be about her changing him, Beauty and the Beast style.<br /><br />**spoiler alert?**<br />Someone told me she signs the contract.<br /><br />So I put the book down and never picked it back up.<br /><br />I think I would have liked it better if it was about a werewolf.nts her to.<br /><br />And here's the thing, she was not into that.

B009PAETCG|1.0|this is so glitchy. it kept freezing up and taking me to the app store. it is so glitchy hate it do not buy!
B0064T6LV8|5.0|The ads are annoying, but it's a free product. Fun for the Kindle fire.  I'm sure the little one will enjoy this game.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Great product and a great price. I highly reccomend this product. Great cost and the item was in great shape.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Great app. This app works as if you are using your home computer.  Adobe Reader loss quick without incident. Very useful app.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is easy to use and has a great little memory screen to remember your problem!  Best of all its free!!!!!!!
B00015YVD6|4.0|A fun movie even now...Tom makes me laugh always has I  think this was his first movie after his TV show
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a great book.  It keeps you spellbound the entire time.  It kept me smiling during the first 23 chapters and ended up with a big smile at the last sentence of the story.  I would recommend it to both adults and children.

B007DIQC90|5.0|As almost everyone else has said, a fantastic album that has cast a spell over me! Dreamy, folkie, pop, rocking music. Beautiful imagery, intriguing lyrics.  I can't believe no-one else's review that I've read so far has mentioned my two fave tracks, the rocking, chanting, Arcade Fire-ish \\"Six Weeks\\" or the sad, evocative, almost-Western-soundtrack \\"Your Bones\\". Buy this CD if you're sick of the garbage that passes for music right now, and want to try something a little different but still eminently listenable! I bought two copies of this album - digital and a CD; that should tell you something!
0316228532|4.0|This book is extremely sad, and not at all like HP. Rowling is a brilliant writer... The beginning of this book was quite slow, but it definitely picked up and amazed me. Very sad ending, vulgar writing, but very realistic. Must read.
B009APMNB0|5.0|This is used for my professional monitor calibration and it works fantastic. Simple to setup, use, and put away until I use it again. Great product (as all of X-Rite's products are).
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie, once again, has given us another top-notch CD. Her voice is incredible. I had the pleasure to see her in concert twice and it was by far one of the best musical experiences I've ever had. She is quite the entertainer!<br />She has more than earned the title of \\"country music entertainer\\" of the year.
B0039TD826|2.0|This Stones album has been reviewed into the ground, both those that love it and those that don't. I'm not going to attempt to persuade either side but only to make this point: if no one had ever heard of the Rolling Stones and this album by an unknown band came on the market would it be declared the masterpiece that it widely is? I doubt it. The Stones were already considered the greatest rock band ever at this point - a declaration I'm happy to say I don't agree with - and thus Exile arrived with Stones fans already highly anticipating it. It's not so much that the album continues no signature hits, it's the fact that, well, the quality of the writing just isn't up to that set by earlier records. Taken completely on its own, Exile is an interesting exercise in its moods and textures but hardly an album to run out and buy. The album is only one of the most overrated of this period BECAUSE it was hyped as not only one of the Stones best but one of the best albums of the era.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This was a real page turner and an unusual story line, however, I was very disappoined by the use, or overuse, of  the F.word.<br />Not necessary!!
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|I can't even get past the enter player name at the very beginning so I can't play at all. Very disappointing waste of good money.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I just needed a case that would protect my Kindle when I was not using it.  I did not want a case that connected as that just make the Kindle weigh more when using it.  I have the same case for my Kindle keyboard 3G from years ago and keep it in my backpack every day along with some heavy stuff at times and I have not had a problem so I was very happy to see that Belkin made a case for the newer models.<br /><br />Highly recommended for protection if you don't want to have the added weight while reading.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|My daughter had been asking for blu rays for Christmas.  I was so glad to find this one online at such a great price.  Whenever I went to the store for this movie at the sale price after Thanksgiving, it was sold out.

0802473164|5.0|Purchased the regular edition as well as the mens version. All of them are similar in nature but good, helpful reads. Worth re-reading occasionally.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|The basic premise is that Santa Claus is a title...a job description, if you will, passed down through the Christmas family. In present day, there are four Christmases living at the North Pole - Grandpa, Santa, and his two sons. One son is militant and precise, and destined to be the next Santa. The other is timid, shy, and completely misunderstood by his family. However, when (at the end of the Christmas run), it is discovered that one single child has been MISSED, it is up to the youngest son (Arthur) to save the day. This movie came out in theaters last year, but I don't remember ever hearing about it. I don't know how else to describe it except...adorable. It has a great message (service for the sake and magic of service, instead of for the glory of it), and is something I would definitely watch every year!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I know there's been a lot of reviews saying the video quality and the colors were horrible. I don't agree. My kids love it as do I :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|More and more scientific people are writing about their near death experiences.  This account helps give credibility to our existence on the other side.  There is consciousness even without physical brain waves.  More studies are welcomed in this area.  Dr. Alexander's description of his experience is most riveting.  If you are &#34;on the edge&#34; with your thoughts on this subject, this book is a must read.
0385340540|5.0|A very entertaining novel. Nice plot.<br /><br />Joel Backman is a convict, to serve twenty years, but by some political miracle he is released from prison after six years only to be eliminated by someone. That's what the CIA was hoping. Backman has many enemies who want to see him dead. The Americans, the Russians, the Chinese, the Saudis, and even the Israelis are after him. He holds a secret that they all want. But Backman, after his release, knew exactly who was after him. He is slick, he is clever. He roams Europe in the hope that no one finds him. But he is found and almost eliminated. Backman, always a step or two ahead of his pursuers.  A real page-turner. Highly recommended.

B007L6VR12|4.0|Wes Anderson's best films seem to be about young people, rather than the neurotic adults for which he became famous, and \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is his most youthful effort yet. It takes place during the summer of1965, on a sparsely populated island somewhere in New England. Twelve-year-old Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) has resigned his commission and gone AWOL with a miniature canoe and some supplies from a Khaki Scout camp under the command of Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton). The local authority, police Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), goes looking for Sam only to discover that Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) is also missing from her parents' home. The young couple have apparently run off together, just as a hurricane works its way up the coast.<br /><br />Sam and Suzy have a hard time getting along with people, but they see themselves in each other and hit it off right away. In spite of their frustrations, they're full of youthful optimism and a yearning for adventure. And they go out and have that adventure, leaving the adults to worry and search frantically for them. These two young actors are very appealing, and their antics, however eyebrow-raising are sympathetic and funny. The adults are also sympathetic, if a bit disengaged from life until this incident galvanizes them. -With the exception of a woman representing social services (Tilda Swinton), who wants to have Sam committed. She seems to represent the menace of the mainland, where people do things differently than on the friendly, laid back island.<br /><br />I love the period touches -Suzy's minidresses and blue eye shadow, record player, and less neurotic, simpler, dispositions in general. But \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is not a period film. Anderson uses 1960s motifs when it suits him and anachronisms just as easily. Sam and Suzy are more romantically sophisticated than sheltered middle class kids were before the internet. Suzy's parents are both lawyers, which leaves me to wonder who takes care of her three little brothers if her mother works long hours. There were not many female lawyers in the 1960s, much less with young children. The couple is also old to have children that age by the standards of their generation. It's Wes Anderson's whimsical universe, not 1960s America.ers if her mother works long hours. There were not many female lawyers in the 1960s, much less with young children.

B0090NNQX6|4.0|I really liked this album. It arrived quicker than expected, which was nice :-)<br />About the music (I don't know if this is relevant?)<br />I rated four out of five stars, I was and is still very happy with Mika's music, and the only minus I have<br />is because I like the other albums a little bit better. But the album is still filled with happiness and life-joy, just as always.<br />It is just a little bit to &#34;pop&#34; if you know what I mean -  Not that it's bad, I've just think that the other albums is more me :-)<br />But I'll recommend this album for the person who is a mika-fan, a music-fan or just a fan of life and hapiness :-)
B000ID37RM|5.0|This is an excellent piece of  literature with a timeless and thought provoking  message! Great book and movie to spark family discussion!
B003ELOQCK|5.0|Love it! I went to their show in Seattle and was absolutely amazed! This DVD brings it all back for me!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|You can hear the difference between this early album and 21 which she made a few years later.  A good variety of songs - slow/fast but all are easy listening.
B005LLXB9K|5.0|Great DVD showing the history (albeit the edited history) of the band. Definitely a must-have for any true Pearl Jam fans out there.
0307165485|5.0|I had this as a child and would sit for hours looking at the pictures and soaking in the words without even knowing it.  For example: there are pictures of animal characters in a kitchen and every utensil, appliance, and furniture piece is labeled with the word right below it.  I purchased this book to assist me as a reading tutor for 2nd graders.  When they became frustrated with trying to read boring books for younger children or books without pictures, this book was able to capture their attention and boost confidence in their reading abilities.  Go through the book with naming the pictures only, then have them spell the word below the picture and sound out the word, then later play a matching game of word to picture, then words only.  Have them focus on spelling 5 words from the page each week.  It takes a little time, but they are willing to &#34;read&#34; the book on their own time and are eager to show what they have learned.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I usually don't like games. This one is very creative,  interactive, and fun. My seven year old loves it, too.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I have now purchased  upwards of $300 bucks worth of Angry Birds stuff. I have a 4 year old and he has puzzles, stuffed animals, figurines, build your own games like breakin bacon, you name it, back packs, cups, lunch boxes, shirts, underwear,  as i type this he is laying in bed wearing his angry birds space pajamas.  ALL from Amazon.com. here's  the deal, you cant tell me in the game,  being  played on his Kindle  Fire, that Hoth is available  and NOT have it. I dont care who's  fault it is. I'm  shutting this charade down. I'm  tired of being played as a customer, oddly  enough i still have some persuasive  power over my kid's likes and dislikes. This charade  has gone on long enough, stop acting like you're  a decent business and not a bunch of crooks. You shouldve just given us the damn board, you think me \\"liking\\" you on facebook is going to change someones mind?  You think some J.O. on facebook hasn't  heard of you yet? Its a shame with Christmas  right around the corner I'm  going to have  to lie to my son about your company.  You think i won't lie? Theres a magical frickin  elf downstairs  on my shelf,  guess again tough guy! Huuuuge mistake.  I will now use my social media skills to tell people about your inconsiderate  greed.
B004RE29PO|5.0|had to own it on blue ray, I've got it on DVD but this is a movie worthy of Blu ray.<br /><br />fantastic Sci Fi horror film, good guys die, the menace is real, scared the crap out of me back in the day, loved this movie, love the attention to detail, the technical aspects, the honesty of it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fantastic book.. the plot and characters draw you in and make you a part of this beautiful tale. Orson Scott Card did a fantastic job!
B000P0J0D8|3.0|this film has a considerable number of actors who've gone on to do bigger & better.<br /><br />Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Christopher Walken.... a solid and distinguished cast to be sure, the dialogue is cheesy and the movie is quite clumsy.  When new I considered this movie as one of my top 10, but having re watched it I can no longer support that position, it's a good movie best left to the younger more forgiving/naive generation.<br /><br />to expand on the above their are too many lapses in logic in True Romance to ignore, these are spread throughout and not isolated to the beginning, middle or end, they are also not isolated to one character but instead spread amongst the cast as required to further the plot.<br /><br />to be clear this does not ruin the movie, it's a solid 3 stars out of 5 or a solid C/C+ movie, but given the number of errors and mild silly overall that's the best I can give it.<br /><br />special note: Gary Oldman is the best part of this movie, he owned his moment, his was the character that captured my imagination, overpowering in every way.... a fantastic powerhouse performance.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Loved this movie years ago.  Haven't seen it since my daughter wore out the VHS tape!  Looking forward to seeing it this Christmas with the whole family.
B0073U2FB2|4.0|This is a B movie, it's not an A list title, treat it accordingly.  I liked the idea of an alien invasion, I liked the aliens, I liked their methods, I didn't care about their reasons but I liked that they had some and I really liked their weaknesses.  I also liked the good guys and the overall movie while definitely low budget is reasonably solid, the closing line was the worst but I can't condemn a movie for the last 2 minutes, it's worthy of repeated watching if you are into Sci Fi like I am.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|Wore out the VHS tape years ago.  Looking forward to watching this at Christmas time this year.  Michael Caine is wonderful as usual.  The whole retelling of this story is done with a fresh take and wonderful Muppet humor!
0307749606|5.0|The latest Lee Child book about Jack Reacher again is not a disappointment.  Anyone who has read or listened to the series will enjoy this book.
B004G6009U|4.0|Enjoyed this movie so much that I bought it for my daughter for Christmas.  Looking forward to seeing it again in blu ray.

B001GKJ2FC|3.0|Decent storyline, tons of special effects, lots of killing. Just what you would expect. No surprises here if you purchased this.
B000002U9P|5.0|If you like Tina Turner and who doesn't this is a must.  Lots of really great songs with passion in them that gets you up and partying.  The energy of the music is great and makes you feel - wow that was good.
6304711891|5.0|The Rock was an amazing action movie with a wonderful acting job by all the actors to bring the action, drama, and intensity to the big scene.  Like I have said before one of Cage's better action roles inculding Con Air, and Gone in 60 seconds.  I can't seem to get enough of this movie, I do believe I have seen it 4 times now since buying it a long time ago.  It does contain one of best car chase scenes in modern movie history, plus the intense scenes from shooting on The Rock is mind blowing amazes me everytime I see it.  So if you like your old school high intense car chase scene, and great fights, plus lots of things blowing up, then buy this movie and savor a great action flick on an evening you have free from a hetic lifestyle.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Funny movie! Got it at a great price as a Christmas gift. Came quickly and for once not in a big waste of packaging.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|Great show, but last season was much more suspenseful.  Would recommend to others for viewing.  A must see! Jessica Lang is awesome

B007X4ECMI|5.0|I lpve this movie its amazing and makes me laugh plus i now kinda like the actor who's playing snow  ;-)
0920668372|2.0|I bought this for my cousin's newborn by glancing at the top books - bought this, along with good night moon, where the wild things are, etc.  I had never heard of this book, whereas the others I remember from my own childhood.  Well, when I thumbed through this one, I thought the ending was super creepy.  Why would the mom sneak back into her son's house, and I didn't expect to see in a book the son cradling an elderly mother.  Surely a book that will lead to some psychotherapy in later life!  I get the sentiment, but I suggest you look at the last few pages before you buy it.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|A great deal of investigation to develope this fascinating theory of why certain countries do not take advantage of their potential.
B009NOVCTM|2.0|The title of my review says it all. As other reviewers have complained, song edits are unacceptable. Also, there is no recording info, so you can't tell when the songs were recorded or even what albums they were from.<br /><br />Good music, bad production and packaging. Recommended only if you must have a picture of a gorilla on your CD shelf.
0446580848|2.0|I have read every DeMille book and have loved each one.  However, The Panther was such a letdown.  It lacked the intensity of the Lion series, which were superb books, and it lacked in its ability to hold my interest, which has certainly not been the case in the other books by this author. There were characters in this book who I very much enjoyed in other books, but more time was spent on John Corey's banter than on developing the character of the Panther (as was done with the Lion) and developing a good story.  I am so disappointed!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A very well written story describing a fascinating and complex individual.  I sometimes wished I was more of a computr geek to fully appreciate all the obstacles overcome by the Job's team.
B003O86FMW|5.0|She wrote this for young adults!  Truth!  Based on things I have seen ans heard maybe most people aren't getting it but this could wake up a whole generation!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Interesting account of Yemen but short on suspense and action until the end which was a bit predictable. I always enjoy Mr. DeMille's writing style and humor which was present in this book.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I give it 1 star bc I can't give it 0. It stinks! It won't load more than the 1st 5 stories...
B009186JYI|5.0|Towards the end of the footage there is a 2 or 3 minute segment where some of the Stones are standing / sitting at a piano, drinking what appears to be white wine or vodka, and playing around. They seem to be a bit tipsy or maybe just very tired. The time frame is mid to late 1965, just after the hit Satisfaction has been released and the Stones are in their creative prime, touring in Ireland. Keith and Mick go off on an Elvis rant and begin to sing snippets of the King's hits. Included are That's When Your Heartaches begin, Blueberry Hill, and Are you Lonesome Tonight. Keith, on the piano, does a very good singing rendition of Santa Bring My Baby Back to Me. Mick has the sneer down. There is a mocking tone to their impersonation, but also respect is paid to Elvis. You can tell they have been positively influenced by the King of Rock and Roll. There is an absolutely hilarious moment where they repeat the phrase \\"Ah Ha huh\\" a la Elvis of the King Creole era. This small portion of the DVD was particularly fascinating.
0738711500|5.0|I never used tarot before and only became interested by getting mine read at a renaissance faire.  The reader was very accurate, and i became a fan.  These cards are very pretty, easy to memorize the meanings of each card because of the art.  It's a well thought out, well made item.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|All these screens look the same to me...a pile of boxes in a building....The version with the ads is too annoying to try to play
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This movie isn't the greatest movie ever, but it's a realistic depiction of how we may handle deep space science and the handling of anomalies that point in the direction of the observance of intelligent life out there.<br /><br />This movie captures the same spirit that the original The Day the Earth Stood Still did so long ago in ythe 50's.<br /><br />There's no crazy unbelievable BS (cept for the end for some people) deus ex machina, but it makes me think its the most realistic depiction of first contact.

B004N6369Y|4.0|Humorous anecdotes of running a hotel business with daughter n her father. I was thrilled when her father married  his second wife despite Heloise's outrageous protests!
B00406UK7S|5.0|My husband enjoys movies while he's out of town for work. It is so inexpensive to stock up at Amazon. Haven't opened this movie yet, but I'm certain it will be in great shape, just like the others. This movie was hard to find....except on Amazon. Should've looked here first.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Finished it in a day. Absolutely loved it and will not watch the movie till I read the whole series.
B0000549B0|5.0|My daughter saw just a few minutes of this on television recently. Was tickled to find someone on Amazon had it available. Putting it with her Christmas, so can't attet to the quality of the DVD, but am sure it will be fine, like all their other products.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|I did not know much about \\"Game of Thrones\\".  I never read the books.<br /><br />I got hooked and watch it often.  So much is going on, that I discover something new each time.<br /><br />I guess situations are resolved in the books, but at the end of Season I, I have questions:<br />1.  What happens when the go past the Wall?<br />2.  How does a dwarf become/act as Hand of the King?<br />3.  What happens with the dragons?<br />4.  Does the Stark kid ever walk again?  I guess all the kids grow up.<br /><br />I ordered Season II and am anxiously waiting for it.  I cannot wait to find out the answers to my questions and discover what new ones I'll have.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This book is a favorite of mine. I probably have read this story twice a year, without fail, for ten years. Some things never get old.
B00498XP1K|4.0|Really enjoyed this series. I just think it ended too soon. As soon as all the players were in place, the story ended instead of building. The acting is spot on and loved the use of music.  The song Grace Kelly playing while zombies rip out throats is a nice touch. Must see for the zombie traditionalist, even with the fast zombies.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Fantastic, well written story. I relished every moment with the characters and dove into this story. Such a fun read!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is always a great read. Since I'm current with all of his books, I've had to slow down my reading time so I could make the book last longer.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series with it's memorable characters, unique backdrop and human qualities. Not a pretty story, but certainly a human one. I, for one, could not put this down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an amazing book. I loved how it had so much action and romance at the same time. I am just waiting to read the second book!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm very pleased with this series. Well written, with great characters and a good story. I applaud Ms. Collins for her work. Well done!
0520224787|5.0|Robert's translation comes at Three Kingdoms from an academic vantage. His afterword is exception as are his notes very thorough. His prose is exceptionally readable and delightfully entertaining<br /><br />That said, this edition itself is somewhat frustration to use. All the notes appear at the end of volume 2, meaning you'll need to carry around both books and constantly flip between pages to take advantage of them. If you are interested in the text as an academic work, this is very frustrating; of course if you just want to read, this keeps all the research out of your face. I would have liked to have seen Robert's hard work more prominent in the work--footnotes instead of end notes and more maps and figures.<br /><br />With that said, this is without question the best translation of the Sangouzhi tongsu yanyi. The question is which version do you want to read. This is probably the best and more affordable option. There is also a cheaper 4-volume paperback and an expensive Chinese-English parallel text version. Don't read the abridged version unless you have a professor who is afraid to assign a 1,000 page novel to undergrads :)

B0002WZTOI|4.0|Tony Scott's \\"Top Gun\\" was obviously built on the template of \\"[[ASIN:B00003CXBT An Officer and a Gentleman]]\\" and was a mega-hit in May/June of 1986.<br /><br />THE PLOT: Two hotshot Navy pilots, Maverick (Tom Cruise) and Goose (Anthony Edwards), are sent to a prestigious flight school in San Diego where they must endure the rivalry of other pilots, like Iceman (Val Kilmer). Maverick seeks a relationship with one of the school's civilian instructors (Kelly McGillis) and also faces a crisis when his cocky confidence is shaken.<br /><br />\\"Top Gun\\" is basically a modern \\"[[ASIN:B00008AOTN The Blue Max]]\\" in that it mixes the drama on the ground with the excitement in the air. It's a good mix that keeps it from being one-dimensional.<br /><br />Some criticize the film as being superficial fluff but, while \\"Top Gun\\" is definitely a blockbuster, it actually has some credible depth. For example, the rivalry of the pilots, the mystery of Maverick's father, the grievous death of one of the main characters, and Maverick's crisis of confidence. A good example of the film's depth can be seen in the scene where Iceman confronts Maverick in the locker room after a tragedy. Iceman is sincere but walks on eggshells because he respects Maverick's unpredictable and dangerous nature. The scene rings true-to-life.<br /><br />Tom Skerritt is notable as one of the older instructors of the school, Viper. There's a good scene in the 2nd half where Maverick visits Viper's house on a Sunday, which features a great (funny) line from Skerritt (\\"I'm not going to blow sunshine...\\").<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film has been accused of being somehow \\"homo-erotic.\\" Nonsense. In case these clueless critics didn't notice, Maverick is chasing McGillis' character throughout the film and even \\"breaks into\\" a Ladies Room to see her. Meanwhile Goose is happily married with children. As for the locker room scenes and the all-male volley ball game, the story takes place at a flight school where all the students are MALE. The volley ball sequence is just a fun scene, nothing more, and was likely thrown in for the ladies. Besides, notice that Maverick leaves the game prematurely to go see HIS BABE. I can't help but wonder if these criticizers are projecting their OWN ISSUES on to the film. Enough said.<br /><br />On the downside, there are some cringe-inducing scenes, like the aforementioned one in the Ladies Room with its awkward dialogue. A minor flaw is that the film starts to lose its drive by the final act, maybe because it drags on and should've been edited. The film runs 110 minutes, by the way.<br /><br />\\"Top Gun\\" has a decent mid-80's soundtrack highlighted by Kenny Loggins' \\"Danger Zone.\\" Speaking of the soundtrack, Judas Priest's excellent track \\"Reckless\\" off of [[ASIN:B004IY6AH6 Turbo]] was picked by the producers for the soundtrack, but the Priest boys foolishly turned down the offer because (1.) they didn't know who Tom Cruise was since he wasn't a major star until after this movie, (2.) they therefore didn't think the movie would be a hit, and (3.) if they sold the song to the movie it would've been omitted from TURBO. Big mistake because the film was a massive blockbuster and it would've rocketed Priest into superstardom. In any case, listen to \\"Reckless\\" on youtube sometime and you'll see that it would've fit the movie perfectly. It also would've been the heaviest song on the soundtrack by far, even though it's light by Priest's standards.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: \\"Top Gun\\" screams mid-80's blockbuster and deservedly so. It's a kinetic film with a nice mix of drama, fun, crisis and aircraft excitement.<br /><br />GRADE: Bstudents are MALE.

B005LAIHZE|4.0|Very good movie.It's one of my top 10 easy, for si-fi horror.a different look at vampire history for the imagination.should get at lease 2 good sequels  if they make them right.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|There were a few parts in the beginning, I wondered if it would become a typical blah blah blah butterfly effect novel. Then bang... could not put it down. Loved the connections and the sweet ending.
B004QK5N5W|3.0|Works fine, but I hate being held hostage by Apple and being over charged for components that cost so little to make.  If it wasn't for my kids, I would not own an iPad.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This book was what I expected, a nice easy quick read. Silly and semi unrealistic adventures. I enjoy how the adventures and people he meets, comes together throughout and at the end.
030758836X|3.0|It took me quite a while to get into this book.  Not sure I would have continued if I hadn't been reading it for book club.  Books about people, like Nick, who are so apathetic bug me.  After a bit though, I really did enjoy it - but then the ending!!  Or lack there of.  I agree with the other reviews; the author seems to have worked Nick and Amy into a situation that she didn't know how to finish (and the way she did finish it was frustrating).  By the end, I can't even imagine someone as *spoiler* wronged as Nick or who could possibly be more apathetic about his and his child's future.  For such a clever middle, Flynn should have come up with at least a decent ending.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim has really incorporated a lot in this book.  There are tons of cooking recipes but he has also covered survival, DiSSS, languages and so much more.  As with all of his books, you can apply the principals to just about anything.  The hardest part is thinking through the process yourself.<br /><br />They have done a great job with the photographs and layouts as well.<br /><br />I bought the Kindle version and the hardcover.
B0053O89IS|3.0|I was a huge fan of the show, but my enthusiasm has drastically waned since the producers decided to make the 2 stars a couple - with child, no less. Without the frictions from the fundamental disagreement between Bones and Booth, the show has lost much of it's fun factor. Those frictions have now become contrived cartoons of the show itself. It's gone from really fun to ho-hum, seen it before.
B007N0AEWY|5.0|Nick Waterhouse is a musical genius. The entire album offers up a piece of modern day along with the soul, jazz, and rhythm and blues of the 50's. He is a breath of fresh air. You can't find music like this anymore.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|This was an ultra-violent movie, but if you saw the first one, you knew what to expect. Based on the cast, you wouldn't expect anything more or less. I loved the humorous exchanges and quips between all the &#34;old time&#34; action stars. It was just a fun, blow-em-up kind of movie.
B00A5052YE|5.0|Alicia does not cease to amaze me. This album is more of an awakening and acceptance of change for the better. It's truly a masterpiece in its entirety.

B0031R5K68|4.0|Like all Dan Brown books, this is a great relaxing read. The plot is a little fantastic at times and continues in the same vein as Angels & Demons and the Da Vinci Code. As always, it's a constant page turner and I found it hard to put down.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Love the cast, the direction, the production, the writing, all were great. The show was cancelled far too soon, but this movie helped ease the pain of the loss.

B005LAJ23A|4.0|I dont want to spoil anything so ill keep this short. This season is even more intense than last season!! If you enjoyed season 1 youll LOVE season 2!!! My only complaint isnt from the show itself, but the picture quality. For some reason, the whole season is extremly grainy, I wouldnt recommend getting the Blu-ray version, just go with the DVD ans save yourself a couple bucks because its not crystal clear like other HD content ive watched.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|As a former military man and author, I feel foolish for buying this one.  I should have known better.  No matter how well written such a story is, one will always know there are necessarily missing parts.  Probably for a layman it is quite interesting, as the ghost writer did a nice job.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|If you like the alpha male and the shy girl type stories this one is for you! This is one of the very few stories that I will without a doubt be going back and reading. I cant wait for the second part of this book to come out in early 2013. It's the same story but told from his point of view instead of hers witch I am excited for. There were so many times I wanted to know what he was thinking or why he did something so I will am very excited to find out!

Never had a problem with water.  Besides these primary reasons for me to buy, I think it looks pretty good, and keeps excellent time and date, all for a reasonable price.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I recommend this book to every one who wants a great book!!!!!<br />This is not the only book that was wrote there's a whole series leading to the end!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Have read all Vince Flynn's books and they get better and better. This was a real page turner - finished it in one day it was so good.  Wish he'd write faster!  Looking forward to his next one.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Excellent movie with lots of main actors. Storyline was fun and had humor while making sense. I highly recommend this for adult entertainment only.
0316069434|3.0|Love the Harry Bosch books, but this one was a hard start.  It seemed as if the first 1/3 of the book was a set up, told mostly in a narrative style that was hard to slog through getting to the good parts.  Good thing I wanted to know what happened to Harry, because if I hadn't read all the prior books and loved the character, I would have given up way before the good stuff started to happen.

B0054SMID0|5.0|The story and acting are well done; the movie took me by surprise.  Excellent entertainment.  Matthew M turns out to be much more of an actor than a romantic lead.
B0084HJE0S|5.0|You won't learn the code just the ideas and history involved. Its really useful for beginners and people returning to programming.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|I thought this movie was pretty good, but Marilyn Monroe sure wouldn't act the way she did in this movie.  Marilyn wasn't afraid to do things, and she acted like a scared cat in the first part of the movie.  When she was running free on her own, she and a man that was working on the set had fun together.  That was cute, but I was hoping the movie would be better.  Michelle Williams was cute, but I couldn't buy her as Marilyn Monroe.  The movie was pretty good though.
B009LUCPWQ|5.0|Great songs, contemporary lyrics, great guitar work, the band now looks like aging doctors or lawyers but sound fresher than most of the new bands on the scene;

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This saga has taught me so many things about the society we live in, about people, about human's resistance. The end of the book is no less than excellent, thrilling at every page, surprising the reader. I believe the book makes justice to all who loved the first two books even though the scenario is not a new hunger games but the cry for freedom for all people of panem in the hands of a group of very brave men and women who will give all even their lives in order for their love ones to be free and safe.I highly recomend it!

B009KHDT0C|4.0|If you enjoyed the TV series, you will probably enjoy the movie. It keeps with the spirit of the show in terms of camp. The performances are good all around and Johnny Depp is very entertaining. It was probably too ambitious overall, but still good.
B002LAM7PI|1.0|My kindle could never download it and I never got to see what was it about. I did not even get a refund. I tried to download it from my daughters kindle and she could not download it either.

1401232590|5.0|This is my favorite Batman graphic novel by far. Basically I read this and I said &#34;I need to immediately read everything Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale&#34;. Sadly that list isn't very long. However, I love this. It's an incredible storyline, it feels great in your hands, the art is stupendous, and it's just SO GOOD. It would've been good in regular novel form but the art makes this unbelievable. I bought a copy for my friend because I think everyone should read it. Don't think about it, just buy it.
B001N4Q4MA|5.0|Great movie. Not only my kids love it but so do I.  Hilarious, funny, and all around entertaining. Dr. Seuss never gets old.
B00062PN6I|5.0|First of all I'm not going to go on and on about how good these are for the money. Many other reviewers have already made that point very clear. The point I want to make is regarding the issues most of the one star reviews have with this product. Some people claimed they were junk because one side of the phones either didn't work right away or stopped after a certain amount of time. You have to realize that with virtually any type of electronics product, unless it's very high-end, a small percent of that item is going to have defects of one type or another. You can't realistically expect every single copy of a product to be completely perfect, especially when you're talking about one that is made inexpensively by the thousands. If the manufacturer had to thoroughly test every single aspect of each copy you would not be paying that low-end price. It is also important to understand that the number of one star reviews is not comparable to five star reviews percentagewise. The reason for this is due to the fact that if someone is upset and angry about a product they are much more likely to take the time to vent their frustrations by writing a review complaining about the problem they had. On the other hand when a person is satisfied with their purchase their complacency makes the likelyhood of returning to the website and writing a review substantially less. Just imagine how many five star reviews there would be if every satisfied owner wrote a review. So in short more people are likely to write a one star review than a five star. One reviewer said he bought three headphones and one did not work. He therefore surmised that one out of every three headphones was defective. When you consider my first point I explained along with a little intelligent reasoning you can see how this type of logic is totally ridiculous. Another reviewer complained that the headphones were made of cheap plastic. Get real, what did he expect for ten bucks, titanium? Then there was \\"it's a cheap thin cord that will break easily\\". I've owned my headphones for eight months and snagged and yanked on the cord numerous times. The cord has never come close to breaking and is actually a decently thick diameter. For people that claimed the 1/4 inch jack did not fit their port, you simply unscrew the the 1/4 inch tip off the cable end revealing the smaller 1/8 size underneath. To quickly address some of the other complaints: Of course they fit snugly around your ear, how else would they effectively cancel outside noise. I used mine for hours every day for eight months and the stitching is nowhere near coming apart. The soft earpads make the fit very comfortable, and they're very easy to adjust. The final verdict is simple. If you can possibly find a better pair of headphones for ten bucks then buy them. I say Good Luck.thin cord that will break easily\\".

B005LAIIHG|4.0|A young boy's family is moving their zoo animals from India to Canada when a storm sinks their freighter.  The only survivors are Pi, a hyena, a zebra, and a tiger named Richard Parker, who find themselves in a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean.<br /><br />On the plus side, I liked that the movie was faithful to the book. The photography and special effects were breathtaking; director Ang Lee has created a dreamy, magical, and stunningly beautiful world. The CGI tiger was excellent; I couldn't tell when he was drawn and when he was real. The soundtrack is lovely.<br /><br />On the down side, I found myself glancing at my watch at times, wondering when it would be over. The pace was too slow for me and I think it would have been an even better movie had 15 minutes been cut from it.<br /><br />The acting was outstanding and fans of the wonderful book will not be disappointed.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|I usually love Pixar movies. In my opinion, they've always delivered great films. This movie, however, was truly disappointing. The trailer made it out to be more of an adventure film but instead we got a cheesy and unoriginal animated feature. This may be because they replaced directors mid-film. We'll never know what was originally intended for Brave and while it may be a shame, there's no use trying to find a masterpiece where this is none.

B0099G3I96|5.0|The first concert I ever went to see when at 9 years old was No Doubt. At the time it was when TRAGIC KINGDOM had been out for over a year. Of course they played all the songs, and I remember it being an awesome concert. This is also when I discovered that the band is somewhat insane. Adrian, the band's almost naked drummer, with his mohawk. The entire band wearing makeup, not just Gwen Stefani. And worst of all was the mouth of Gwen Stefani. You'd think that she was raised by sailors. Being 9 years old these kind of things intrigued me, but because I was a \\"good kid\\" I never enacted said attitude outwardly.<br /><br />Like many I was obsessed with TRAGIC KINGDOM for many years, and much of the music I listened to I compared with this CD. It more than likely fell short, even the band themselves I thought at times.<br /><br />Fastforward to 2000 and their release of RETURN OF SATURN. After a few listens I couldn't get into the CD so I set it aside for some time and continued with my waning obsession of TRAGIC KINGDOM. Although I still loved it I wished that NO DOUBT or any band/artist could release an album equal to it. So began a musical purgatory in my life. Nothing sounded great, like TRAGIC KINGDOM. Then the band released Rock Steady. At the time, I thought it was strange that the band was trying to penetrate the reggae market. Many of the songs on ROCK STEADY were what I needed to spark my interest in music again. I was worried about the direction of the band because of all the reggae influence. I went back and listened to RETURN OF SATURN and saw that the band was just evolving their sound with each record. I then became intranced by certain songs on both records, awing at the talent of that each band member has and refined sound that I think Tragic Kingdom lacked, being such a raw album itself. This elegance made its way onto the band's single/remake of IT'S MY LIFE.<br /><br />Then began the hiatus of No Doubt, which included Gwen's solo career, which was OK, but not what I had come to expect from the collaboration of the band & their affiliates. Band member, Tony Kanal, did help P!NK with FUNHOUSE. I can totally see a NO DOUBT influence sparking the music and lyrics behind this P!nk album. This is maybe why I love the record so much and one I hold to a similar standard to NO DOUBT's previous compilations.<br /><br />So here we are ... the recent past and current present. After my own musical renaissance in college, the force of music came flooding back into my life stronger than ever, becoming a love of  mine again. I began following the band again. I listened to every album many times over. I learned to love each album on its own. I thought that if this was all NO DOUBT would ever do together than I would have to follow them separately. I settled for thinking I would have to get my NO DOUBT fix vicariously through those artists they chose to light the flame of greatness beneath.<br /><br />BUT THEN, the band announced that they were working on a new album. I eagerly anticipated its release even through its delayed release (to the agnst of their fans) and my delayed order from Amazon. The best stunt they could have done is release a song telling fans to SETTLE DOWN and that is exactly what they did! Just one more reason to love NO DOUBT. Not only that, but Settle Down is such a silly song that kinda has a weird fit to the puzzle of PUSH AND SHOVE as is the title track. One thing that I have seen in the progress of NO DOUBT is that they have been increasingly slipping into the background of music (I see parallels to Alanis Morissette). TRAGIC KINGDOM being their big breakout success that went further than they could have ever dreamed. They created an album that set the bar. Everything from their looks through to their entertainment factor pushed the envelope. This continued into RETURN OF SATURN, which despite not being as successful as TRAGIC KINGDOM still set the bar for alternative/pop rock. With ROCK STEADY they hadcrazy fusion between pop, rock, electronica and reggae, but it worked. They were conforming somewhat, but they were still pushing their fanbase into new territory. PUSH AND SHOVE seems like a move into the background. Almost a fading out if you will, which would have made sense like 5 years ago. But Why put out a CD if you don't think you are going to continue making music together?<br /><br />Despite this factor and what many others say, I love PUSH AND SHOVE and I think it was worth the wait. My only complaint is that I think that Gwen could have sung some of the songs with a little more passion or displayed some kind of variation throughout each work. The record feels like a glimpse into the soul of the band and where they were up to where they are presently, which deserves a little more conviction on Gwen's part. Just like a NO DOUBT album though, each song is unique and fresh. So its not the band's best work, but its still a fantastic collaboration between its talented members.crazy fusion between pop, rock, electronica and reggae, but it worked.

B007JOM0GC|3.0|For a very long time I could not stand Ms. Perry. To some extent that still holds. Originally when I bought the album (for >$1, and even then I thought I was spending too much) I only liked Teenage Dream and Firework sort of. Luckily, after much gritting of teeth and forcing my mind to stay open, I ended up kind of liking it enough to say it was worth my $1 (and maybe more).<br /><br />Serious guilty pleasures for me are CALIFORNIA GIRLS and LAST FRIDAY NIGHT aka I will openly say I hate these songs. Both feelings are true. When both came out and played every other song on the radio, I wanted to kill her for making such annoying songs that were way to catchy. Still I can only listen to them once in a blue moon or the irritation sets in. The remix with Missy Elliot of LAST FRIDAY NIGHT is far better, cuz Missy Elliot is da bomb.<br /><br />Teenage Dream and Humingbird Heartbeat are my two favorites on the CD. They kind of have the same premise, but both have a nostalgic sound behind the lyrics as well as at face value. I really love Hummingbird Heartbeat because it reminds me of the music that was on the radio when I was growing up. Though, I am not a fan of the first line \\"you make me feel like i'm losing my virginity.\\" In this way and many others I am worried that Katy is going in the direction of Rihanna with TALK THAT TALK. SEX, SeX and more sex. I'm not sure either one of them is even more tasteful. This also shows me how Katy Perry struggles with a good metaphor at times. Firework is a nice feel good song, and I especially like the video. Seriously though, who in their right mind feels like a plastic bag (this line almost ruins the entire song for me)?!<br /><br />Despite being a little heavy in sexual expression, I do like DRESSING UP. The lyrics seem to be a little more clever than Katy's usual innuendo filled songs. As for the other two new tracks PART OF ME and WIDE AWAKE, once again annoyed me when they came out, but they grew on me gradually.<br /><br />I was reading reviews on the original version of the album that included NOT LIKE THE MOVIES. Many were saying that this is Katy's best ballad. I, myself, find this song utter rubbish. OK, maybe not that bad, but THINKING OF YOU is a far better ballad and still my favorite Katy Perry song. On the original album I think CIRCLE THE DRAIN takes the cake on the ballad award, but in this \\"confection\\" WIDE AWAKE is where her voice shines the most.<br /><br />Peacock has some capable lyrics and some simple but intriguing background music, but in the end it drives me crazy because its just so stupid. Pearl for me is forgetable. Lastly, and least in this case, is this Tommie Sunshine remix. Its dull, plain, uncreative, limited imagination, repetative, all that stuff.<br /><br />After listening to the album I think there is quite a bit of reptition. There are a lot of twins on this album or from her last album.<br />Teenage Dream: Hummingbird Heartbeat<br />The One That Got Away: Thinking of You<br />Circle the Drain: Part of Me<br />E.T.: Dressing Up (I KISSED A GIRL)<br />Firework: Pearl<br />I think you could find a match for almost every song. For this I think the record deserves 2 stars. As far as the music behind the lyrics, I think Katy has done something elegant with simple beats and incorporating electronic beats while blending them with a regular rock style musical set-up. For that she deserves a 4, and the album grew on me. It gives me hope for the future of Katy Perry's next try, so I'm going to give it a 3.was reading reviews on the original version of the album that included NOT LIKE THE MOVIES.

I definitely did not pick up on the (anti)religious undertones as a kid.  The author reminds me of an Atheist version of C.S Lewis.  Religion aside, this is an amazing trilogy, and I'm please to add it to my collection.  Each book is difficult to put down.

B0050XFY4O|4.0|Exploring brothers loving each other and expressing their love in intimate, sexual and sensuous manners was somewhat disconcerting.  I think most of the world's cultures share the view of incest as a taboo subject.

It challenged my values, but I leave judgments about this subject to One who is, in my mind, is the only One so qualified.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|As I live in Newton MA, where the author resides and set this story, the location and character depictions of the &#34;natives&#34; ring true.  The PTO Moms, the Whole Foods styled array of uber-fresh produce (to be wasted soon enough when the appear imperfect) were on point.  Also hitting home was the scary scenario that most parents fear; could our child be accused falsely of a heinous crime, and- perhaps more horrifying to conceive of- how easy is it for parents to overlook and/or deny serious psycho, anti-social tendencies and behaviors in our beloved children?<br /><br />I love a good thriller, and found Landay kept me in the page-turning mode.  The premise of a young teenager, presumably innocent, being accused of murder is so disquieting. Of course we would defend him!  The family understandably begins to unravel as the case progresses.  The legal and court system are foreign to most parents, and in this case the father is a District Attorney so must balance his professional knowledge with his fatherly sense. The layers of the onion of Jacob's personality, seen through his school-mates' eyes and the reflective history of his childhood and development his parents must look at and reveal to a psychiatrist, start to constrict the reader's chest and &#34;gut&#34; level instincts. What the father, and this reader, want to believe begins to conflict with what the evidence seems to be pointing at.

B000JJ4PDK|2.0|I know, I know.  How could I give one of the hottest hip hop albums of all time two stars, right?  Well I've got a better question for you:  How could Bad Boy piss all over Biggie's legacy and mutilate this classic?<br /><br />Before they spend their money on this fakeness, the fans have the right to know...especially the young folks who weren't even around back in the day...that the album you see before you...this so called \\"remaster\\"...is NOT what Biggie fans rocked out to in '94.  This is NOT the album that was bangin' in the clubs, in our cars, or at our house parties.  Take it from someone who was there, this so-called \\"remaster\\" is not just an enhancement of sound quality as the name might imply, it's a totally different album.<br /><br />Don't get it twisted, the original version, the one with the white cover, wasn't some rough mix that was stolen from Easy Mo Bee's basement and released on the streets as a bootleg or whatever...it was the official studio release.  The one you bought at Sam Goody, Coconuts, or, until 2006, right here on amazon.  And now it's gone forever in favor of this inferior mess.<br /><br />And why?  Money, mostly.  And a touch of political correctness.<br /><br />1.) Bad Boy's legal department apparently f'd up and some of the samples used on the original weren't cleared properly, so rather than tap into their billions and just pay whatever licensing fees were necessary for the re-release, Diddy and company decided to just CHANGE THE ORIGINALS!!!  So now, tracks like \\"Machine Gun Funk\\" and \\"Ready to Die\\" sound totally different.  They are not at all what we heard when we first bumped this album back in '94.<br /><br />2.) Some of Biggie's original lyrics were apparently too raw for the sensibilities of the new millenium so they were edited out or backmastered.  Most notably on \\"Juicy\\" where he spits \\"time to get paid/blow up like the World Trade\\" referencing the 1993 attack on the towers.  On the remaster, the words \\"World Trade\\" are edited out, presumably because someone might think he was making a reference to 9/11 seven years before it actually happened.  While I understand that 9/11 was a catastrophic and horrible event, and would certainly agree that a rapper using it as a euphemism for accruing wealth would be unbelievably crass, I also don't think that record companies should go back and selectively edit albums that came out seven years before the tragedy even happened because someone might think that Biggie was Nostradamus and predicted the whole thing in his crystal ball, thus compromising his original vision and lyricism.<br /><br />Now that this \\"remaster\\" has come out, the only way to get the original is to run it down in some used record store.  Think about what this means.  Kids who grew up hearing that Biggie was the best and wanting to hear the album that their elders say prove it will rush to purchase or download this \\"remaster\\", because it's the only thing available, not realizing that they are NOT hearing what those of us who copped the original heard back in '94.  They're not hearing Biggie as we heard him.  They're not hearing his magnum opus.  They're hearing a compromised, mutilated version of that album. Again, think about what this says about Bad Boy's respect for their greatest artist, the man whose talent they pretty much rode to wealth and glory. Would anyone dare to dream of doing this to the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\", Bob Marley's \\"Catch a Fire\\" or Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\"?  No?  Then what does this say about Bad Boy's respect for Biggie and hip hop as an artform in general?<br /><br />Because it's Biggie, I can't bring myself to give even this mangled version of his vision one star, but because this musical mutilation is the auditory equivalent of putting boxer shorts on Donatello's David or a bra on the Venus de Milo, I also can't bring myself to give it more than two.<br /><br />To the young hip hop headz out there, consider yourselves warned.  If you want to hear Biggie as 90s headz heard him when this classic disc first dropped back in the day, this isn't the version you're looking for.  Pressure Bad Boy to re-release the \\"classic version\\" full and intact.  Peace.o hear Biggie as 90s headz heard him when this classic disc first dropped back in the day, this isn't the version you're looking for.  Pressure Bad Boy to re-release the \\"classic version\\" full and intact.  Peace.

B0055OG2BC|4.0|Even though this is a spoof of the ever popular and everlasting James Bond film dynasty, it is the first full length film version of the Ian Fleming novel. It is not the first time though that 007 made the American screen if you count the TV version of Casino Royale with Barry Nelson as 007. With three different James Bonds (David Niven, Woody Allen, Peter Sellers), in one film and some great Bond Girls, it add an award nominated Burt Bacharach music score (The look of love).  Many of the film's actors/actresses were in previous or subsequent 007 films and one went on to play the most galactic villain of all time: Darth Vader.  This film was indeed entertaining especially to see all the well-known actors/actresses all together in one film. None of the iconic James Bond film gimmicks or puns might disappoint the dedicated Bond fans; so I rated it a 4 instead of 5. but it has so much other credits to compensate for that. Read all those details here: [...].

B005CGI4EG|4.0|Married with Children: The Complete Series on DVD is an affordable but wonderful gift for the television fan of this long running sitcom. Previously, I bought all 11 seasons, one at a time, for a lot more money.<br /><br />I wished all television series on DVD would just come out in a nice package like this one. It comes with all the DVDs and no other information to help guide the viewer though. That's one criticism where I felt that if I didn't have it on my other collection, I would be lost looking for a specific episode.<br /><br />If you do plan to purchase this DVD series, you will get it an affordable price but the packaging needs to include information regarding episodes and specials. Still it's a fabulous gift for the Married with Children fan.

B008BDZOXQ|3.0|The music is very good but the live performances are even better.  Too bad there is not a live version of this.<br /><br />As for the vinyl pressing, it is not very clean with a fair amount of low level noise that can be heard between tracks and in quiet sections of the recording.  Unfortunately I've found this to be a trend.  As the price of vinyl has shot up the quality of the pressings is not what they used to be.  I could have received a bad one.  But I fear they all may be like this.
B0094RCD5U|5.0|I just received my copy of the Remaster/Remix edition of what's certainly a classic album by most standards. Its groundbreaking inventiveness and bold diversity of genres remains relevant today, and can hold its own with any works being released now. Because of that, 5 stars may not even be enough to acknowledge its beauty, power and place in popular music.<br /><br />As far as the remastered versions, I'd say that they sound differently enough (brighter, more balanced mixes) to justify their claim.<br /><br />Now, if you are, like me, someone who'd order it excited to receive a \\"special edition\\" of this masterpiece, you might be significantly disappointed, both by its misleading description and actual return on your monetary investment.<br /><br />To begin with, this edition is described (verbatim) as \\"packaged in a 5 card mailer with the album's artwork screen-printed per the original release.\\" What you get is a CD in a regular jewel box (no additional tracks or versions, by the way) inside of a box replicating the jewel box front cover art (which I predict you'll find annoying to open repeatedly) and, rather than a booklet, accompanied exclusively by a single heavy paper card, once again, replicating the front and back of the box that encases the jewel box.<br /><br />I'm still wondering how this could be described as \\"a 5 card mailer\\" and how it may be considered a just homage to such important work. Needless to say that paying $14.99 plus taxes and shipping for it, infuriates me. A digital version for under $10 would have been more than enough.

B009NPKTN6|1.0|I watched  a half hour.  And Froze to a frame that really showed off Toms age.  So bad it would be torcher to watch this again
B0063IH60K|1.0|I apparently did not read the information that said every time you start a new game an ad will interrupt your game as soon as the game starts.
B001IAOEXU|1.0|These triggers clip onto the existing trigger buttons on your remote.  I put way too much pressure on those buttons in the heat of a game and keept breaking them off.  Tossed in the trash.
B008J34466|5.0|I really really love Pink!!! The way that she sings about love and relationships really 'hits' home. I hope that she can produce more CDs in the upcoming years!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Simply the best game ever.<br />I bought the PS vita just to play this new version of P4, because I really loved the original P4 for PS2.<br />This is the best purchase I made this year. Nothing to complain about... or maybe, yes, about this: it's too awesome and great!! :)<br /><br />I'd recommend this videogame to people who like both some plot and mystery, but also some action.
B004R5Z30Q|2.0|I had been seeing the trailer for the movie and I really wanted to read the book. But I was really disappointed with the way that the father teaches the children the importance of never turning your back on a wild animal. To respect the wild animals. I won't give away too much about the book....but being a lover of animals I couldn't finish the book.
075669812X|5.0|Wonderful Lego book, exactly what I was hoping for. My 8 year old is going to love getting it under the tree!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I'm enjoying this show so far.  While the first two seasons were mediocre at best, this season is really taking it up a notch.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I would recommend this fantastic book to any Greek mythology fan it is perfectly paced and keeps you on the edge of you seat the entire time making you want to read it till its finished
B000UX6THK|5.0|Excellent weird TV series.  Too bad it was cancelled too soon.  More weird story lines would have transpired if the show had not been cancelled.
B0053O89WY|3.0|This not my favorite show but my mother loves this show and i cant wait to see her face on christmas morning when she opens it up.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I used to play this game on my Android phone and later downloaded onto my Kindle. For some reason I could never play on my Kindle. It never would open. And I eventually ended up deleting it from my phone also because it would lock up quite often and starting working really slow. It was fun when it was working right but eventually became problematic.
B002EDH0FE|4.0|The dark side of heroes, I thought it was a great movie to watch after the kids go to bed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a pretty cool variety of games to play to pass the time and have some fun. It's entertaining.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Megadeth has really been surprising me the last few years or so, getting a start with 'United Abominations' but still wasn't QUITE there, but it was a good start at them getting back to what made me love them, 'Endgame' came along in 2009 and knocked my socks off, I heard Megadeth with speed and aggression again, I was pleasently surprised, and was hooked on that album from the get go, and still am, so when 'Th1rt3en' was annouced, I couldn't wait until it was released, unfortunatly I live in an area where there isn't much in terms of CD shopping, and I have no car, so I had to wait until I could get to a place that would have it, Walmart here carries Megadeth, but not this album, or Endgame when that came out for that matter, booo!, so thats why I'm so late getting it/reviewing it.<br /><br />I bought it the other night with the most recent Anthrax 'Worship Music' (another awesome modern metal album as well, I recommend that too), but I had to listen to this one first, I wanted a continuation of Endgame, but what I got was something even better...in my opinion anyways, and I loved Endgame, but this one I think tops it, I find it more aggressive, and throughout the whole album pretty much, it retains it's speed, and killer leads which we've all come to expect from Dave Mustaine, and he does not disappoint here, and his vocals are in top form as well, this is the same line up that brought us Endgame, so it seems that Dave has found the right parteners in crime that he has good chemistry with, David Ellefson is back, and James LoMenzo has departed, which is a shame, but it's nice to see Ellefson back with Mustaine, Lomenzo did a really nice job while he was with them though, I'm sure some band employed him.<br /><br />The band sounds tight and crisp as ever here, everyone shines, like I said, Dave has found a line up that works with him well, all the songs are nice and thrashy, and maintain that catchiness that Endgame delivered on, and Dave and Chris work awesome together, as the leads and rhythms on this album really blend, as both deliver in both departments, and Shawn Drover hits the skins with precision and has some catchy rhythms, definetly one of the best metal drummers today, Dave sure knows how to pick his crew now, I felt that was a problem after Youthanasia, the line ups just weren't talented enough to work with Dave, while I'm sure he did most of the writing, but it takes the personel too.<br /><br />My favorite tracks? Ha, all of them really, but the following dominate my ears right now,<br /><br />Sudden Death, Public Enemy No. 1, Guns, Drugs & Money, New World Order, and Millennium of the Blind, but as I said, I can listen to this album all the way through without skipping, another thing I should mention, is the production is excellent, might even be better than Endgame, all the instruments are heard as they should be, and Daves vocals have the right tone and volume, it doesn't drown out the music, but it's right up front, like it should be as I always felt he had a good thrash metal voice, some people will differ, but thats my opinion.<br /><br />So bottom line, if you liked Endgame as much as I did, you sure absolutely love this, buy with confidence, also pick up the recent Anthrax 'Worship Music' if you're an Anthrax fan of old, you will love it!
B0012QCZ54|5.0|My 14 year old daughter is a dancer who has been dancing since she was 3 yrs old. She absolutely loves all the Step Up movies and collected every one that has been released. She will play them when she has the company of her dancer friends and at times when she just wants to see some good, clean entertaining dancing.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|It's about time, especially since the John Bush era was really bad in my opinion, and also in my opinion, Belladonna Anthrax is the only Anthrax, so when I heard that Joey Belladonna would be back in the line up for the new record, I was really excited, and couldn't wait to get my hands on it, especially hearing a sample of it off of Youtube, I heard 'The Devil You Know' and I could tell right off, that this band was back to it's true origins for the most part, gone is the nu-metal sound which dominated the Bush era, especially 'We've Come For You All' back is the speed and aggression, and the slow chugging stomp riffs that made me love the old Anthrax, and the shout vocals.<br /><br />This album sounds like a mix of State of Euphoria (which I thought was an underrated album) and Persistence of Time, which was the last of the first Belladonna era, you can even find some 'Among The Living' and 'Spreading The Disease' moments, such as 'Fight 'Em 'Til You Can't' 'Earth on Hell' 'The Devil You Know' which all have some excellent drum work and killer riffing, together with Belladonnas excellent vocal style, then you have some mid-paced songs which just stomp in the vein of Persistence of Time such as 'I'm Alive' 'In The End' and 'The Constant' which has a riff at the beginning that just bleeds heavy which dominates the song, so they mixed it up nice with the faster songs, to the more mid paced ones, and a couple of really slow doomish ones, and yes there is a ballad here 'Crawl' and it's really good, it's mellow for the most part, but it does have it's heavy moments, and some nice acoustics, so there is something here for everybody.<br /><br />And a special shoutout to Joey Belladonna, I wasn't sure how his voice has held up over the years, it's held up very well, he sounds like he did in the late 1980's to the early 1990's, this old man still has it for sure, as the rest of the band does, this is a band right now that is just full of energy, and I'm delighted to see/hear that, the next album will probably be even better, but this is damn good, especially since they haven't done anything in almost 10 years, over 20 years without Belladonna, so I'm sure the chemistry is rekindling, but they have made an album that will please us fans until the next one for sure, my hats off to this band, 2 of the big 4 are still churning out excellent Metal in my opinion, and that is Megadeth and Anthrax, they are keeping it alive! \m/<br /><br />One final note, the album comes in a bad digipack, I really do hate these things, and they seem to be coming along more now, the new Soundgarden was in the same thing, as was the recent Alice in Chains, the kind where you slide the discs out of the back, I hate them, but that's not the bands fault, but I really wish these would go away.
0811876373|5.0|This book is great. I have been interested in trying cake pops for a little while now but wanted to find some kind of guide such as this one. I still haven't tried making anything just yet but I have browsed through the book. I will be using it very soon, probably over the holidays. It has some really fun and cute creative ideas and the instructions are broken down so simply enough to understand. There's also fantastic visual pictures that give you tons of options for the different cake pops you can make. This one is a winner.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Post Kristen Stewart scandal and all that, didn't know much about the movie. Rented it because it was .99 and I just wanted to kill time. Surprisingly, the movie pulled me in much more than I expected - special effects were really good, and it started out mostly with Charlize Theron, who was amazing. Then, the main star - Kristen Stewart - appeared, and it all sort of went downhill from there.<br /><br />In fact, I can't think of as single other movie I've seen where everyone and everything works (okay, maybe not spectacularly, but they all worked) *except* for the main character. The huntsman worked, Ravenna's brother worked, Ravenna was amazing, even the Duke and his son worked. The dwarves all worked. But Snow White herself was the movie's undoing.<br /><br />In crucial moments, when I felt honestly moved by the movie - I kept thinking, \\"Come ON, Kristen. Give us SOMETHING - ANYTHING.\\" Everyone did pretty well to support this character, and it was the least believeable character in the entire movie. I don't get it. How could they have made such an amazing Ravenna and such a flop Snow White? I get that she's the highest paid actress around due to the Twilight franchise, but really - such a disservice to the rest of the cast, and the movie itself.

B001EC0OMM|4.0|Trying to find something happy and intelligent to watch?  Look no further!  Great old film with a trio of talented stars.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Alice Munro never disappoints.  Her stories are rich with the kinds of details that create an immediately familiar world, and her voice is the voice of a natural storyteller.  I find her characters entirely  believable but always able to surprise.
B0097NGUJG|4.0|There are some great songs on &#34;An Awesome Wave&#34; and alt-J has a really interesting sound, dark and a little bit fantastic.  I didn't really like all of the 'Interlude' tracks though.
B0057MFA42|1.0|I got this blu ray as a gift. I originally recorded it on my DVR off of the Palladium channel. The palladium version is perfect. My Blu Ray is flawed. The audio is out of sync with the video, BIG TIME!! This is not the case with my other concert blu rays and I have many. My equipmentr is top of the line too. These other customer complaints are spot on. FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I don't feel good.
B007MDB548|5.0|I love all the Tink's Movies, any body Dissing this movies it's just not really seeing the big picture. I love this movies cause I love animation and I feel it's hard to make such a movie and I love the way this people in Disney just keep making<br />great things like this for me and my family to enjoy. I love art and animation. I feel you have to, if you want to enjoy your self with any animation and cartoon. I forgot about Peter Pan with this new Tink movies and I still love Pan's Tink also. I hope they make a pan or at least how Pan got with Tink. That would be great. I love magic and faries and well all and I am a 44 year old male with a kid's heart to love and care for all if I could, and this movies are all about that. We all know about reality, so please don't mess with the fantacy. I love Tink and that is that and this 4th movie is just a wonderful movie with colors and white all and magic that and well? what can I say. I loved it, and the 3D was great and my wife loves it and so do my kids all ages by the way. I hope you guys buy this DVD set and keep it till it's gone from Natural degration or you just loose it or give it as a gift. If so, just buy another one. I would if I lost mine. I hope you guys enjoy this as much I we did as a family. Good luck in all you do and happy holidays, and forgive my spelling and punctuation. I flunked math and english. Enjoy!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book I have read. It is easy to follow and is well thought out. I recommend this book to everyone.
B004G600A4|5.0|One of the best Disney Movies I have ever seen.  A great movie for Boys Girls and Adults.  Classic story with a Modern Twist
B004LROUNG|5.0|As always, Grisham never disappointed me. I read it in 3 days and couldn't stop. The little buffette is a mixed between a disaster and a home for the lawyers. You are going to enjoy it for sure.
B0086700CM|3.0|A little slow starting.  I've switched to Vince Flynn's latest which is more my taste.  Then I'll go back to Cussler.  I bought it, I'll read it!
1608871452|5.0|This book is so much bigger than I thought, and it so beautiful. The photos are amazing, there is so much to see and read, with lots of little extras peppered throughout the book (envelopes with postcards/photos inside).<br />This is a DEFINITE must for all Supernatural fans, you will not be sorry to buy it. I am completely impressed!!!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|WHAT I DIDNOT EXPECT!!!! BE IN THE MOOD FOR A VERY DIFFERENT READ.I AM REALLY GLAD THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Anytime the notebook boy wants to stomp people out and drive like a maniac count me in.<br /><br />He should have changed the jacket though
034580404X|1.0|Maybe not the worst book ever written but certainly the worst book I ever read...<br />Repetative, boring, trite, unimaginative and just plain awful.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I don't know why people consider this movie a fail<br />Great music<br />OK story<br />Visuals were good<br />and he got her off the grid.
B005LAIHQS|2.0|Once again I received a movie from Amazon with the 100% USELESS ultraviolet download.  Hopefully one of these days, I will get sick enough of getting this garbage and just stop buying movies.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Best video<br />Best movie based on a game<br />Great super villian<br />We are going to need some sort or part 2 or a movie for one of the newer games or something.
B008ELUEQC|1.0|I know this is a Christmas album but where is his edge? Rod sounds like an old woman on this CD. Very disappointed.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I was overly excited when I was allowed to buy this book (I am only twelve and my kindle is rigged to my father's amazon account). I immediately realized the fact that the difference between the two demigod factions was going to add quite a few twists to the plot. The social maladies that occur are enough to keep you reading the book straight through by themselves. Rick, as always, continues to heat up the character relationships. Especially between Percy and Annabeth which is one of the most captivating sub-dramas throughout the books.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the entire book straight through to the end. My only complaint is the fact that the book ends on an extreme cliffhanger that leaves you itching for several hours afterwards. I can't  wait for the next book to be released!
B000OV85AW|5.0|Worth multiple viewings as these two stars are at their best, besides who doesn't like redemption when you can get it?
B0094BB4TW|3.0|i have facemook on my phone and computer and the print is fine.  The print on the kindle is too small and i cant see anyway to increase it
B002PLALCO|5.0|I think this is an outstanding concert, I have loved her music for years, and when I got this would compare it to Cher's farewell concert in terms of a very beautiful concert. (funny thing the musical director is the same fella that was with Cher on her farewell concert)  I sure hope she can top this one with another.  When I need something to pick me up, this is it, takes you to a different world.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Back to basics for Vince Flynn. Ridding the world of terrorists one at a time. Plus a connection back to perhaps the biggest event in Mitch Rapp's life, the murder of his pregnant wife. Vintage Rapp.
B007HACDLK|3.0|This one looks less intense than the previous ones. I was expecting more. In my view one could expected whats gonna b the end from the beginning.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app....I can create things and share them on google+ and facebook....along with emailing them. what a great tool to have.....
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of the funniest classic Christmas movies ever made! Chevy Chase is at his best! Highly recommend this movie for your personal dvd collection at home!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I used this ebook page by page to get my ebook in HTML format to place on Amazon for sale. It told me exactly what to do and I did it. My ebook was accepted onto Amazon the first time through! Wow! Thanks, Kindle Direct Publishing!
1455519006|5.0|Enjoyed this book. Grabbed my attention right from the first chapter and held on to it thru the end. I expect that from David Baldacci and he delivered.
B0064W652A|5.0|This is a must read for all Batman fans! This has it all, Bruce Wayne's beginnings,all the villians, his allies (Superman and Catwoman)....twist and turns and a GREAT story.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I am generally hesitant to buy entire albums, for the usual reasons. However, I saw this one for 99 cents so I went ahead and grabbed it. Best decision of the week. I already liked &#34;Little Talks&#34; for its catchiness as well as the interplay of the singers' voices. Now I have several new favorites. The songs are unique (I listened for much longer than my average attention span without getting bored). The voices have somehow balanced a fun, catchy sound with a soulful, haunting one. You have to be into this style of music to enjoy it, but for me it's a keeper.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It made me think about the lives of others and when I think about how I hate my job or other stupid things I realize I need to shut the hell up and appreciate what I have. I can't understand why a place like North Korea exists in our modern world it is truly sad.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|One of the best family friendly films I've seen in a long time. Even my 14 & 10 year olds loved it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My brother totally hates this show and I quote &#34;Why if these zombies are so slow and dumb is it so hard for them to kill them, they should just totally lead them to a giant pit of fire, so stupid&#34; Well brother it isn't just about zombies, it's about people and survival. It shows the dumb people, the bad people and the good people. I love that the tells it like it is no sugar coating this show. What would an Apocalypse be like? THIS SHOW, zombies or no zombies. Oh yeah if I could live in a Apocalypse I would totally live in that so called Apocalypse TV show called Revolution, where everyone apparently still has makeup, can have showers, and great looking clothes, that show sucks. Watch this show enjoy it so you can be prepared when the Mayan Apocalypse comes to town. Good luck to all of you when that hits.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This app Is my favorite game but I used to check my dragonvale on gamecenter from my iphone but now I tried to check it from the kindle and it made me start all over I cannot check my dragonvale account I had so many things and dragons.PLEASE GET A GAMECENTER OR SOMETHING!!
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I like it just not everything on it....pretty good. Not into the whole repeating of words and we will call it a song. Some songs felt really thrown together.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Does what is supposed to do fairly nicely. Good app for Kindle Fire HD. Plays good quality videos and music.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I got this for my dads kindle and he really likes the case! He lost it and purchased the exact case again.
0395389496|3.0|Very fast shipping but I ordered 3 books and each had either a small rip in the cover, wrinkles in the cover, or wearing on the edges.  Since they are Christmas presents I was a little annoyed with this.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This may not be the best of the Reacher series, but it's still a good read.  I always look forward to the next one.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is an incredible, enjoyable DVD.  I have it in my own library and have purchased it for a friend as a Christmas present.  What a way to spend a few hours of complete enjoyment.<br />KathleenW - Omaha, NE
1401324649|5.0|LOL funny!  Would defintely recomment to any avid reader looking for something light, entertaining and funny!  Could not put it down.
B000W061HE|5.0|I grew up listening to Whitesnake and a ton of other 80's rock - this one has some killer tracks!
B006VGGAC4|2.0|This book could be 1/4 the length and still cover the important points.  There is way too much detail which makes the book<br />&#34;drag&#34;.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|I am an early Van Halen junkie (Roth version)... so this album was a must-buy for me. I will admit that I was a little skeptical at first, but was blown away when I started listening. Granted, Dave cant hit the notes he used to, but I can live with the vocals the way they are - and Eddie, Wolfgang, & Alex tear it up instrumentally (yes, I miss Michael Anthony, but Wolfgang can pound the bass pretty well).<br />Maybe they havent always got along through the years, but (for me) this version of VH has an awesome musical chemistry that is demonstrated on this album.
B000MD7OKY|3.0|The master of suspense fails to deliver on this one. If you want to experience Hitchcock's trademark sweaty palm edge-of-your-seat movie plots, &#34;North By Northwest&#34;, &#34;Rear Window&#34;, &#34;The Birds&#34;, and &#34;Psycho&#34; will overwhelm you.  Only reason I have this DVD is the ethereal Grace Kelly. Getting back to this movie, the plot is so laid back you better remain wide awake. Mr. Hitchcock's camera work is a somewhat Vistavision tour of the French Rivera during high season where visitors get to display their glittering diamond jewelry and throw their money at the roulette tables. For a little excitement there is a sanitized car chase with Miss Kelly handling her sports car with the skill of a Grand Prix driver while passenger Grant shakes in absolute fear. No seat belts in those cars.  Then there's also a foot chase in a flower market with our hero getting flailed in the head by a tiny flower vendor. From the very beginning all suspicions of recent jewelry thefts led to Cary Grant, playing a reformed cat burglar. So, it's up to him to set a trap so he could nail the copycat and thereby clear his name. After all, he was still technically on parole. Grace Kelly provides the romantic interest. A true fashionista, she never appears in a new scene wearing the same attire. A two star rating for a plodding plot with another one because of Grace Kelly.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I absolutly love this movie. I love every single female in this movie. I love the visual, the sound, and the story. How the hell did this movie get a bad review? Did i see the same movie? Cause this one is absolutly spectacular! I love Zack Snyder and I absolutly support anything he does. I cant wait to see his take on Superman. But you cant fool me Zack, I saw Pans Labyrinth too. But i aint mad at you, it was a phenominal movie and if anybody can borrow from that movie and make it work you got my praise.
1601251505|5.0|This game is amazing. I started playing DnD 3.5 and have since moved on to pathfinder. The rules can be daunting at first, but don't get discouraged. The best part about table top gaming is you can use what you like, and disregard what you don't like. Pathfinder is a really great platform. If you're new to gaming try looking up the Pathfinder beginners box. Its a great way to break into becoming a game master, because everything you need to run a short campaign is in the box.
0547884591|5.0|I loved 4HWW, liked 4HB, and almost didn't buy 4 Hour Chef.  I ended up buying it at Tim's book signing in NY.  The book is filled with a host of interesting info from health to cooking to memory techniques.  Don't miss this one.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Now with two young children, I realized I needed to stock up on some good Christmas movies, so of course I had to have Polar Express.  This is such a great movie and the quality is wonderful.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I chose this rating the movie I believe told the truth!<br />What I like about the film was the clothing was authority by history!
B0076UXKDG|4.0|Yes, we all agree that this grip is overpriced. Being a wedding photographer and always wanting to shoot with grips on my camera, I had no choice but to get this grip when it came out with the D800. But I'm going to go into why I prefer this grip (even with the high price) rather than go with a knock off. The build quality of the grip is absolutely top notch and feels as great as the camera does. It obviously fits like a glove on the D800. The reason I recommend it is because I've had horrible experiences with after market grips on my cameras before. Everything from an extremely loose fit, to battery doors not staying shut, to even frying the circuit board to the camera. So when I don't have to worry about those things when I'm running around at a wedding all day, it's worth it to me. It just felt wrong putting an aftermarket product on such an expensive camera.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like mine craft because I can use my brain so I can make houses and play with friend and let not for get.fight CREAPERS.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This movie was just okay. Some good CGI effects, but got boring fast. Barely made it to the end. Had high hopes.
0525478817|5.0|How can one rate the ability of an author, their description? the flow of their paragraphs?<br /><br />Here, John Green proves his ability to not only wow the targeted teen audience, but also intrigue a wider variety of age demographics, his storytelling is flawless, his character definition was perfect and not one moment was spent re-reading the story in confusion.
B007H1HQW0|2.0|thought this product would work as the video shown.  Too many bottles cracked during the hot/cold bath steps.  Out of 13 bottles, only four came out okay!  Very<br />disappointed.  Not sure if thickest of the bottles (wine) makes a difference in<br />cutting!  Such a waste of 4-5 hours spent!
B005LAII3A|1.0|No atmosphere (Like watching a cardboard cutout of the original, a very well painted and decorated cardboard cutout, but lifeless), no music that strikes a sense of wonder, no likeable personality present in the main actors. Even though the pace was fast and the action non stop, I found myself wanting to fast forward this movie to potential scenes I was familiar with when I watched and enjoyed the first Total Recall back in 1990.  I found very few of those scenes.  I've watched the original Total Recall many times over.  Bought the VHS and then the DVD... I really wanted to like this new version as much, I don't think I'll be watching it ever again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I don't quite know why, but this is a great game to pass a few minutes with at a sitting.  Don't buy coins - you'll get enough over time.  I don't sell the prizes for coins either - I just patiently wait for more coins to \\"recharge\\" over time.  If only I could do as well with the real-life machines like this in arcades :)<br /><br />Update:  after a couple of months...<br /><br />OK, well, I got bored with it after a while.  Much too repetitive.  For a FAOTD it's a nice distraction for a while.  Paying for in-game stuff?  Not really worth that if you ask me.
0142410705|3.0|It's hard to write a review for \\"An Abundance of Katherines\\" because John Green has written such wonderful books that this simply doesn't stand out as an especially strong work.  As an English teacher, I can attest that my students love his books, but this is not one that I often hear about from them.  Still, I thought I would try it since I've loved so many of his other books.<br /><br />Colin, the main character, is quirky.  Unfortunately, he feels too quirky in the same way that if you watch \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" the male characters sometimes feel too dorky.  It feels as though John Green really wanted to find a unique quirk--and he did--but it's just not as engaging as the last words quirk from \\"Looking for Alaska.\\"  He does make excellent use of his quirk within the plot of the novel, but it didn't do it for me.<br /><br />Hassan, like some of the other secondary characters in Green's novels, never quite comes to life.  He's a bit of John Falstaff type character--with all the humor you'd expect.  He's funny, but he isn't very believable in some of the serious moments.<br /><br />I wouldn't go so far as to say this is a bad book.  It's not.  But, if you're coming here from \\"Looking for Alaska\\" or \\"The Fault in Our Stars,\\" it's going to feel like a let down.<br /><br />I'm sure if I had read from his books in a different order, I would feel better ranking this higher.  But I can't.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Fine follow-up from Ken Follett after the Pillars of the Earth duo. If only half of his research for this book is correct, the events leading to WW1 are even more bizarre than I thought.

B004EPYZV2|5.0|This has got to be one of Tom Cruise's best action flicks of all time.  Frankly, I think that it would rank quite highly against any action film.  The fact that Cruise does his own stunts defies the imagination.  This is a slick and stylish action thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat.  A great deal and a spectacular value.  Blu-Ray is a must for a film like this one.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is a good thing I get a limited number of coins or I would waste a lot of time playing this game!
B008OOYALE|4.0|I really like this game but there are just a few problems with it. Its too hard to get gold you have to do the rare quest that gives it to you or hope that a friend sends you some. Another one is that there are way too many pop ups. Sure its fine put two up but five sometimes six? That's a little much. Some of the things are too expensive like you cant buy a magic dragon with coins you have to buy it with gold which is hard to get unless you buy it with real money. Please take these things into consideration. Thank you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thought this series was worth every dime spent. I found myself thinking about this book a lot through out my day. I had no choice but to finish it as soon as possible. Some people may find the story weird but honestly I could see this happening for real. Don't buy unless you plan on losing sleep from staying up late at nighyt...unable to put it down! Can't wait to read the other books in the shift series.

B004JN1CW4|3.0|I picked up the Maze Runner because I was looking for something fun after reading a particularly boring book for a graduate class.  The series was alright and even entertaining at points but I just don't see what all the fuss was about.  It doesn't hold a candle to the Hunger Games trilogy and the resolution that Dashner offers is palatable at best.  I'm still curious about a lot of the things that seem to have gone unanswered.  Maybe I need to buy and read the prequel book but I decided to put my name on the library's waiting list.  This is worth a read if you don't have to pay for it.
0859537978|5.0|my son and I sing the words in this book all day. He loves it. Sometimes when the book is over, we just make up our own words and keep singing. soon as it is over my son asked to read it over again.

B009JBWOU0|5.0|My friend is a HUGE Batman fan and I've bought him all the batman movies since 1966 when they made the original Batman movie.  As soon as I receive this package, I will be wrapping it and giving it along with all the other batman movies to my friend.  I imagine my friend will be so overwhelmed that he will be watching them as soon as he gets the chance to.  He's a great batman fan and he really liked these movies.  He says they're the best he's ever seen and I'm guessing with technology updates and the movies becoming digital, it can only get better!

B000000OXH|5.0|\\"Alpha\\" came out in 1983 as the followup to the band's eponymous debut, but was not well-received either critically or commercially (it went double-platinum, but compared to the debut album it followed, it was a significant disappointment).  The flaws in this album, both cultural and aesthetic, are well-documented, and I won't go too deeply into them here.  The bottom line is this:  suddenly Asia was seen as a band that wasn't \\"cool.\\"  (Not only did they steal Yes's instrumental style - they also inherited their reputation.)<br /><br />However, I loved this album when it came out, and I still do today.  I would love a remastered version to crisp up the sound - Steve Howe and Carl Palmer did wonderful work, when you can hear it, but the mixing technique used seems to drown them out at times. This is a shame, because Steve Howe's guitar work is spectacular, and Palmer's drum work would add a lot simply by being double-tracked.<br /><br />The downfall of Asia's first incarnation was always its lyrics - this was evident from their first single release (name another top-10 single released between 1981 and 1987 that uses the word \\"disco\\" ANYWHERE.  OK - Hungry Like the Wolf? Fine. Name another) - and Alpha's one shortcoming is lyrical.  The Wetton-Downes duo has since matured, and the new reincarnation features greatly improved lyric work, but on this album, there is an oversimplification of some concepts (and some stilted constructs) that diminishes some of the musical work with word choices that at times are average at best.<br /><br />Musically, the melodies and arrangements range from the merely very good (\\"The Last To Know,\\" \\"True Colors,\\" \\"Don't Cry\\") to absolutely wonderful (\\"Open Your Eyes,\\" \\"Midnight Sun\\").  If I were banished to a desert island and were allowed only one recorded song to hear for the rest of my life, I would choose \\"Open Your Eyes,\\" and the only reason I would even hesitate would be its bookend from the Omega album (\\"There Was A Time\\").<br /><br/>If you were alive and socially aware in 1983 when this album was released, I suggest a new listen, without prejudice.  I don't claim perfection here - this is a very good album that should have been great, but wasn't (in no small part by virtue of mob opinion) - a shortcoming for which this band was unduly, and in my eyes, unjustly punished.  Asia deserved better, and even now as they are back together and releasing new (and excellent) work, I hope they will bring together something that rises beyond the sum of their very, very talented parts.<br /><br />Until then, I have \\"Alpha\\" as the soundtrack of my teenage years, and \\"Open Your Eyes\\" as the song I played long ago for a girl with a wounded heart, whom I had watched and been near for two years without hope, on the day she so unexpectedly realized that I was who she wanted.  Looking back, it wasn't the touchstone moment of my life (see above reference), but music strikes the poignancy in us as well as the passion.  This album, for me, connects with both.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My daughter and I loved this movie.. The characters looked real. The story line was amazing along with the songs.....I would definetly suggest this movie to any Family. Merry Christmas...
0374214913|4.0|This book had a great first half - I felt I was off on an amazing adventure involving mind-blowing ancient secret knowledge versus mind-blowing digital technology - neurotic black-robed nerds in dusty libraries of antiquarian books versus cheerful Google geniuses. I was hoping that I was getting into a sort of contemporary Umberto Eco type novel. Sadly the promise of the first half falls a little short as the book morphs into one of those stories (I've read dozens as a child) where the smart kids surprise the grown-ups by solving the mystery. A little disappointing by the end but still worth reading.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Removing this app, was a blast,  but now crashes within seconds of opening. I believe the update ruined the game.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|Last night I went to the Star Trek: The Next Generation movie theater event organized by Fathom Events to celebrate the release of Season Two on Blu-Ray.  I got to see both \\"Q Who?\\" and the never before seen extended version of \\"The Measure of A Man\\" in all their restored glory!  Excerpts from the cast reunion interview and gag reel were shown too.<br /><br />I am writing to say that having this unique version of \\"The Measure of A Man\\" is reason enough to buy this very special Season Two release.  You will get to watch this even more fully realized exploration of how we humans treat other life forms - including those we aren't sure are fully \\"alive\\".  It was always a brilliant episode.. and is even more powerful with these extra 12 or so minutes of dialogue.  It's amazing for me to think of how powerful an episode of Star Trek can be without there being any significant special effects to speak of.  It's all in the writing and the acting!<br /><br />Bu the way, we who were lucky enough to attend last night's event at the Century City AMC theater in L.A. had the extra special treat of having Melinda Snodgrass (who wrote \\"The Measure of a Man\\"), Michael and Denice Okuda, and several other people connected with the show (including Dan Curry, the man who did the special effects originally and supervised their element-by-elemet transfer to Blu-Ray) there in the audience with us!  They introduced themselves to the audience at the beginning of the evening too, and Melinda told us she originally had the only copy of the extended version of \\"The Measure of a Man,\\" because a VHS tape of that version was given to her after the show was edited to a length that would fit in allowable TV running time.  Thankfully, she kept that all these years.  It was used to make the version we got to see last night.<br /><br />Both episodes looked amazing in full high-def, so I'm sure Season Two will look great when we watch it at home.  But I must re-emphasize the value of getting this extended version of \\"The Measure of a Man\\".d version of \\"The Measure of a Man\\".

1451695195|5.0|I was so impressed that such a highly rated doctor would put such honesty into a book. I was happy to read that even though Dr Alexander was really not a believer in God, he was thoroughly convinced after his experience in Heaven.

1402270275|5.0|Love, love, love this book! I get tired of vampires. Everyone's getting a little tired of vampires. But these, these are INTERESTING vampires. When vampires first started appearing, they thought it was all peachy. You get super strength, super hearing, instant healing ...sure, you have to have some blood now and again, but you're so much BETTER than before, so of course only the most noble could receive this gift. And then they discovered that the longest lived vampires began to lose control of themselves. The virus that conferred all that strength and so on, was colonizing their bodies, and the closer it reached to 100% colonization, the less they were something anyone might want to meet in a back alley. Eventually, they determined that the sufferers (so to speak), if not killed, would turn monstrous and wreak destruction. Of course, they also set out to find a cure, and that's where our heroine enters the story...<br /><br />I don't want to tell you too much because I don't want to do anything that would keep you from running, walking, or sending your fingers skittering over your keyboard to GET THIS BOOK. If you ever loved vampires, and/or have even a mild interest in steampunk (which she also handles beautifully), check out this book!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app is amazing!...I have the kindle fire HD. If your a windows user you will love it. You can pretty much make your own files for videos, pics, docs and move them around. It does takes some time and practice to get use to it but its worth it. Also If you have a kindle fire hd don't download any stupid camera or video apps. This has a built in camera app for pics and vidoes. They automatically get saved into personal videos &amp; photos..

B008XNZMOU|5.0|A month and a week later here I am! And it must be known that Taylor Swift's latest effort, [[ASIN:B008XNZMOU Red]] is pretty damn good. At first I was pretty underwhelmed with some of the first couple of tracks on the first listen. However, there were still standouts. And I didn't give up. After a couple of listens I grew to like all of the songs (except for one) to varying degrees. That song with Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol (\\"The Last Time\\") is the only track that isn't that great to listen to. It feels lifeless and on iTunes it's the only track here that is rated as low as a 3/5. The duet with Ed Sheeran (\\"Everything Has Changed\\") fares so much better. Some of my favorites on the album are \\"Begin Again\\", \\"Starlight\\", \\"I Knew Your Were Trouble\\", \\"22\\", \\"All Too Well\\", \\"Holy Ground\\", \\"Everything Has Changed\\" and the cute and light \\"Stay Stay Stay\\" to name a few. That's half the album!<br /><br />Like I said a bunch of the tracks had to grow on me and there is a few tracks that could have been even stronger but this is still a winner. I love the album's diversity and only wish that there were a couple more country pop tunes to fill the album roster. \\"Begin Again\\" was the only song that had obvious country twang to it that I could tell. \\"Red\\" has a light banjo throughout but can only be heard strongly at the very end. I know the serious lack of country-ness has angered a lot of her fans. But I guess if you aren't on this journey with Swift you can find another artist you enjoy instead. After this release it's really tough to figure out where she is headed but I'm eagerly awaiting her next CD of tunes already. For now, [[ASIN:B008XNZMOU Red]]'ll do. Lastly, I'd like to say the deluxe probably isn't worth it. In my opinion, the 3 new tracks that I heard sounded like bland leftovers that should have not made the album at all! I didn't hear the demo versions of the standard albums songs though...<br /><br />This album covers genres of pop, pop rock, dub step and just a little bit of country pop (sorry, Swifties!).<br /><br />4.5 stars.little bit of country pop (sorry, Swifties!).<br /><br />4.5 stars.

At first I thought I might not finish the book, but the more I read, the more I liked.<br />The two main characters are, well, better not give anything away!

B001N3GUIE|5.0|This wholly engrossing, action science fiction is a sleeper from the 50's.  If you are a reader in the Course in Miracles, you will see a graphic depiction of the &#34;ego&#34; as outlined in the Course -- and well before the Course's writing.  (I've been student  of The Course for 30 years, so I might see more in it than others.  I'll risk that.)<br />Although for certain the &#34;ego&#34; really doesn't look like this, nor operate exactly like this, the parallels of the movie are both instructive and powerful as an emotional approach to understanding the human condition.  Besides, much spiritual wisdom equates an emotional approach as superior to a logical one.  Think of Jesus and the parables. Besides, you get to see Ann Francis again.<br />I am quite surprised that this old (and presumably forgotten) gem is arrayed with other spiriual items.
B0095R64AO|5.0|Funny! Romantic comedy, goofy, and great development of all characters.  I wouldn't go into watching the movie expecting it to be similar to bridesmaids though, you'll be disappointed.

1552095258|4.0|A paddle-making friend with far more experience recommended this book to me as &#34;the bible of paddle-making.&#34; While Warren's instructions are detailed and clear, the book is aimed at someone with a fair bit of woodworking experience. He starts with a comparison of various styles and paddles and a bit of history. He takes you through paddlemaking step-by-step, explaining what tools (or substitutes for some tools) you'll need. His fairly evenhanded comparisons of various options (ex: oil or varnish to finish the paddle) and advice on what tools are nice to have, those you cannot do without and shortcuts that he's tried (and their varying results) distill his many years of paddlemaking experience into something useful for the hobbyist. He does this with a good dose of humor.) The book includes a variety of patterns and plans.<br /><br />This is my first book on paddlemaking, and, despite my lack of woodworking experience, I think it will be enough to keep me educated and occupied for quite a while. It's thorough and covers every step of the process, including choosing wood, selecting tools, design, carving, caring for the finished product and repair.
B00633PFQC|2.0|This book achieves the purpose of informing the reader of many seemingly non-market items that are actually up for sale.  However, I must echo some other reviewers in stating that Sandel doesn't offer any analysis, advice, conclusions, or make any arguments for where the line should be drawn, or if there should be a line drawn.  He does not tell the reader what the moral limits of markets are -- unless his title is purposely ambiguous and, in fact, there are no moral limits to markets.  It was an interesting, quick read, but leaves you thinking there is another final chapter where he finally makes his own arguments when, in fact, there is not.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|I love the design and feel of it. I use this DAC amp with my Cowon X7 music player and my AKG 702 headphones. I put some 3M dual lock on the back of it so I can attach it to my Cowon X7 leather case. It's simple to use and my only complaint is the battery life. I have to fully charge it twice before my Cowon X7 runs out of battery life. It last hours so it's not really a problem. A little feature I like is how it keeps track of the total system runtime. I currently have used it for 2 days and 7 hours. This is helpful to know since the headphones I purchased need a 100 hour burn in period before they reach their full potential. This is the perfect amp for portable music players.

B00A8ECU24|1.0|well at first I loved it but I would use my gems to skip quests and when id come back its like I never did and not to mention I didn't even get my gems back.  I also spent $1.99 for 20 gems and never received them I contacted technical support but got no reply so I was pretty upset glad I didn't spend more money.  some times a white screen would pop up and say &quot;fake menu &quot; with options to choose from seemed shady.  so sad I really wanted to like this game.

B0067TQQI8|5.0|Not only has this product successfully allowed continuation of remote cell phone communications (Samsung Galaxy S2) on mulitple occasions - it was also beneficial in locating an &#34;under-the-hood&#34; malfunction late at night using its' built-in very bright LED &#34;flashlight&#34; feature.  There is NOTHING like the feeling, in desperate situations, of having no means of communication when seeking assistance, due to a &#34;dead&#34; or very low cell phone battery.  This product does, indeed, become a &#34;lifesaver&#34; in such situations and conditions.  Kids and young adults tend to &#34;over-use&#34; cell phones for (dare I say it!) trivial utilitzations, and then, when an emergency &#34;crops up&#34;, they have no battery power with which to solicit assistance over the air waves.  This device totally eliminates that problem (IF this product is periodically &#34;re-charged&#34;).  The elderly and the very young who own and depend on cell phone use, NEED this product!
B0091LRZZW|4.0|As a fan of the Great American Songbook, I was curious to hear Paul McCartney's \\"Kisses on The Bottom\\" CD when it was released last year. I though he did a credible job in the covers though I thought his voice was a bit off. Still, I felt, he gave new exposure to songs I still play on my 78rpm records. I missed the live stream and the PBS special of this \\"studio concert\\" version of the songs from the album so the DVD package was my first viewing.<br /><br />To make things clear, though the 75-minute centerpiece of this DVD was taped in the studio, with Paul wearing headphones, this was not the actual recording session for the KOTB CD. This was a re-creation with most of the original musicians. While Eric Clapton and Stevie Wonder were on the CD, they are not performing here, though there are interview clips.<br /><br />The package gives a running time of 127 minutes but be aware that this includes the FIVE versions of the \\"My Valentine\\" music video as well as two promo videos for KOTB. There is a 15 minute interview with McCartney and Producer Tommy LiPuma by music journalist Robert Hilburn , from which many sections  were included in the 75-minute core program.<br /><br />I found that WATCHING McCartney sing the songs often covered the age in his voice. Honestly, at 70 his voice is showing its age.<br /><br />I'll defer to my fellow reviewer, Tante Maren, for the details of the program - though he/she had not seen the DVD at the time of his/her review since it wasn't released until two months later. The packaging should also be mentioned. The DVD is inserted in the back of a 5x7 HARDBOUND book which includes a six-page Introduction by Elvis Costello (whose wife, Diana Krall, is the pianist and music director for the performance) and a 26 page \\"conversation via Skype\\" between Costello and McCartney which discusses the albums concert and pop music in general. (Costello has always been a great interviewer of other performers.). There are six pages of musician credits and a number of \\"session photos\\" to fill out the book.<br /><br />Overall I liked the set a lot and McCartney fans will certainly want this for their collection. While the 75 minutes of studio performances were engaging, the multiple versions of the McCartney-penned \\"My Valentine\\" are a bit of overkill for the casual buyer. Hence the four, rather than, five stars.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"and a number of \\"session photos\\" to fill out the book.<br /><br />Overall I liked the set a lot and McCartney fans will certainly want this for their collection.

B009VSW15Y|2.0|I guess it's okay but where you can't take a picture unless someone is sitting on your lap it's worthless.  Glad I did not pay for it.
0761171703|5.0|As a retired dancer and amateur photographer, I can appreciate the beauty and skill it takes to create such amazing photography. Bravo!
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Really enjoyed the movie. It was absolutley nothing like we expected. That made it really interesting. The price match on the preorder was great also.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Presidents Club. It was interesting to see how influential the ex-presidents really are, and how they got along after running against each other.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|Marshal Teddy Daniels arrives at Shutter Island to investigate a prisoner that has vanished without a trace. As his investigation progresses, he makes many shocking discoveries about the island. He learns that there are some places that never let you go no matter how hard you try to break free.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie. Leo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, and Michelle Williams are awesome as always. This story has tons of action, mystery, drama, and suspense, as well as a bit of a horror film vibe. The story is complex and very gripping. Shutter Island is an excellent movies that you don't want to miss.
1416955070|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this book b/c I thought it would be too teenagery but as you read it, it gets interesting. The book came in perfect quality and it shipped super fast.
0792164903|5.0|A murderous, headless horseman is on a killing spree in Sleepy Hollow. Inspector Crane is sent to ascertain the circumstances and culprit. When he gets there, he is faced with a warrior from beyond the grave, and a witch that has her eyes set on vengeance. He may not survive the trip.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie. It has great acting, plot, and an excellent set. The atmosphere created by the fog costumes and actors is creepy and captivating. It's hard to describe such an odd, yet incredible movie. It's just awesome. You definitely don't want to miss this masterpiece by Tim Burton. It's everything you have come to know and love from his movies.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Some folks are recommending taking a pass on the Deluxe edition because they don't care for the rehearsal DVD.  I respectfully disagree at least as to complaints about the audio quality and the quality of the performance.<br /><br />While the video quality is not great, I think the band actually performed better at the rehearsal.  Both Plant and Page seemed much more comfortable not having to play over a stadium filled with noise and Robert's more nuanced mature vocal style works better these days in a more quiet/intimate setting.<br /><br />At one point, Robert asks in between songs whether anyone is taping the rehearsal.  When told the session was being taped, Robert jokes and says something along the lines of \\"Great!  Because we haven't played these songs this well since the 1920s!\\"<br /><br />As a result, I have ripped the rehearsals onto my iPod and I suspect I will listen to it much more often that the CDs of the concert itself.<br /><br />In any event, its all good.  I only wish I had been at the concert (or caught the film when it was in theatres).  Having missed both,this set is the next best thing.  It's much better than the Song Remains the Same and compares very favorably to the concert box set from a few years back.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|After an army of giant robots attacks NYC, reporter Polly Perkins and Sky Captain Sullivan are out to get to the bottom of it. The quest will take them all over the world and they will witness many wonders that will shock them to the core.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie. As usual, Jude Law does an excellent job. This film has excellent special effects, acting and a very unique story. It has action, drama, comedy and a bit of romance. It's a movie that you will never forget.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|After the success of Sonic Boom, KISS' new album Monster was met with much anticipation. The second release to feature Tommy Thayer does not disappoint as the guitarist further immerses himself in the Spaceman persona, sounding more and more like classic Ace Frehley with each note. The songs are standard KISS fare; fans of the band's prior work will love it. The standout tracks for me, after two weeks in the CD player, are \\"Back to the Stone Age,\\" \\"Eat Your Heart Out,\\" and \\"Outta This World.\\"<br /><br />As good as the music is, it would be a disservice to not make mention of the disappointment I felt with the cover art. This is perhaps the most generic KISS album artwork since the first album, which was simple yet still iconic. Many of the band's classic albums, from Destroyer to Rock and Roll Over, are frame-worthy. Monster is an embarrassment in comparison, by far the worst the group has ever released.<br /><br />Is the cover a reason not to buy the album? Of course not. The music is the true product, and the music is vintage KISS throughout. Those who have fully embraced modern technology, though, may opt to purchase the MP3s instead of a hard copy.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This is an excllent series. It has an overabundance of almost everything. Blood, violence, drama, action, suspense, sex, and betrayal are all presented in full force in this very heavy nad brutal series. I am also very impressed by the acting and story line. I don't think there is hardly anything on TV worth watching, but this series is way better than the average crap on my idiot box. I am so glad that that I saw Spartacus. If you aren't afraid of a lot of the stuff I mentioned earlier, then definitely check this out.<br /><br />After making Blood and Sand, Andy Whitfield was diagnosed with cancer, which he recently passed away with. I read an article<br />in the paper talking about it. While Andy was receiving treatment for his cancer, they decided to go ahead and make this prequel. It said that while it was possible to get another actor, they wanted Andy to do the next season. He did such a marvelous job, there is no way a man like that can be replaced. The events in this season all take place in the time just before Spartacus arrives at House Batiatus. There are many of the old characters, and plenty of new one as well. The story in this season is almost as good as the first. Everything else that you have come to expect from this show is also showcased in God's of the Arena. If you liked season 1, then season 2 is gonna make you happy too.
B008QOH1NG|5.0|Hair metal, the once heralded king of the late 1980s and the butt of many jokes in the post-Nevermind 1990s, has some of the most rabid fans in the world. Over the past couple of decades, bands that once reigned the rock radio airwaves have been making a comeback, fighting the stereotypes and releasing new music. Religious rockers Stryper, however, may have been one of the last groups people expected to reunite. Singer Michael Sweet enjoyed some success as a solo artist and other band members found other projects, but a few years ago Stryper, whose name is a reference to Isaiah 53:5, decided to take the stage together once again.<br /><br />With Live in Indonesia at the Java Rockin' Land, fans have the opportunity to relive the glory days of the yellow-and-black attack (sans the spandex). Brothers Michael and Robert Sweet, Oz Fox, and Timothy Gaines blast through 69 minutes of classic Stryper material, from the big hit \\"Honestly\\" to the fan favorites \\"The Rock That Makes Me Roll\\" and \\"Soldiers Under Command.\\" The concert is what you would expect from a band that is three decades old; the songs still pack the same punch, even if the singer isn't able to quite reach the notes after all these years. That's not to say he sings poorly; on the contrary, Michael's voice sounds good, just not perfect...but what's the point of a live recording if it sounds just like the studio release?
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Spartacus was betrayed by the Roman Empire. His villiage was destroyed and his wife sold into slavery. He was also sold to a man that trains gladiators. At the mansion, his master promises to reunite him with his wife if he becomes a victorious gladiator. Under the whip, Spartacus learns the art of murder very well. He is very close to being together with his wife. But can he survive the arena, and can she survive slavery long enough to meet again?<br /><br />This is an excllent series. It has an overabundance of almost everything. Blood, violence, drama, action, suspense, sex, and betrayal are all presented in full force in this very heavy nad brutal series. I am also very impressed by the acting and story line. I don't think there is hardly anything on TV worth watching, but this series is way better than the average crap on my idiot box.

B007UWBQEU|5.0|I must have been sleeping on a rock to forget about her! This album is awesome!! There is depth & meaning to the songs; not all depressed like some artist in her genre would be.
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|GREAT CD/DVD AND HAS ALL GOOD SONGS AND VIDEO OF KILLERS... WOULD GIVE TO FRIENDS AS GIFTS AND KEEP FOR SELF... GREAT BUY
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I rented this film because it featured several of my favorite actors - Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand.<br /><br />It turned out to be a colossal waste of talent. The basic plot - two pre-teen kids run away when they fall into mindless infatuation - could have been interesting, but the screenplay fell far short of the basic premise and the two lead child actors were simply awful.  Could-not-act.  Truly painful to watch.<br /><br />As for Anderson's directing, he doesn't seem to know whether he wants to be John Waters or a kiddie-porn anime director.  How this film ever garnered enthusiastic reviews simply befuddles me.
B0086700CM|5.0|my whole family really enjoys playing temple run that is why I want to rate it I give it 5
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|another great game by G5 Entertainment. They make awesome hidden object games and are always fun to play:-) Way to go!
B007PVHANM|5.0|Very real, human portrayal of massively iconic musician, Bob Marley.  Exquisite and poignant photography, documentary footage, directing, script and editing.  Will no doubt stand the test of time, as has Timothy White's (unrelated) quintessential book, &#34;Catch a Fire, The Life of Bob Marley.&#34;
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this album.  The whole cd is good, and was a steal at $3.99 for mp3.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This movie is a great one to have for the holidays.  The colors were vivid and it is certainly a movie the whole family can enjoy.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I don't buy CD's very often and this is one of my favorites.  Been following them on youtube and purchased this cd. Great music and these guys are talented.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is a replacement for the one I purchased just after the PBS airing too long ago to say the year out-loud!  A friend borrowed it and never returned the set. I believe this to be the best rendition of Austen's classic and I do not tire of rewatching it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love all the Mitch Rapp adventures and could not believe this one was over when it ended.  Looking forward to the continuation of the journey.
B008S80OU2|5.0|If you're anything like me, you cringe at how, for several years in the public's consciousness, Blue Oyster Cult was criminally identified with one of \\"Saturday Night Live\\"'s most grossly-overquoted sketches, rather than the creative body of work they'd produced since the early '70s. A proper box set treatment has eluded them, unless you count a few of the bulkier \\"best of\\" sets or three random albums in one package.<br />But this stellar collection of BOC's Columbia albums does justice to \\"the thinking man's heavy metal band,\\" including all of the group's albums for the label, plus rarities, bonus tracks from earlier individual-disc remasters, and a DVD, all at a surprisingly reasonable price.<br />It's hard to whittle Blue Oyster Cult down to a single disc of their best (that hasn't stopped anyone from attempting it) or even three or four discs with a smidgeon of outtakes or unreleased tracks. So, this set wisely avoids that task and presents BOC in (most of) its heavy metal triumph. The best part is that such overlooked albums as \\"Cultosaurus Erectus,\\" \\"The Revolution By Night,\\" and \\"Club Ninja\\" are finally given a rerelease on compact disc. This is a fun and insightful set, a great way to give Blue Oyster Cult a retrospective look...if we can only forget Christopher Walken and his tiring \\"fever.\\"
B007RE0SCW|4.0|I wish she would have come with more props. Maybe a Robe or some sort of dress. Seems rather too simple.
B0095J0AL6|3.0|While my daughter is thrilled to have the yearbook CD, I was less than thrilled with the mickey mouse job SYCO Music did on the back cover for the yearbook edition. The track list is held on in four spots by the springy glue dots they use to hold fake credit cards on the letters you get trying to get you to sign up. Really SYCO? Couldn't you afford to secure something as important as a track list better than that? Already the thing is bent at the corners and she's only had it her possession for less than an hour. I looked for a way to contact amazon.com about this, but the only thing I could find was a way to return/exchange the CD. Is there anyone else who got the same packaging we did and is disappointed? Let the masses rise up and revolt!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|The ad it puts up after drawing is glitched. Just the picture and a white screen. Sometimes it doesn't register my drawing due to this and i have to draw a different picture with different words. Almost a deal breaker.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|Love the Gillmore girls show and with the help of Amazon i have now purchased all 7 seasons of the DVDs at a reasonable price
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Cant say more than others have said. this is a great Deftones CD. Much better than 'Diamond Eyes' and 'Saturday Night Wrist'. As good as 'White Pony' and 'Deftones'(S/T) CD. And on the same par as their best, 'Around the Fur'. This is a classy, moody and heavy album that mesmerizes and then pummels you. A lot of Chino M's Vox sound very clear yet he still finds those gut wrenching screams when needed, just not as many. The band is tight. The disc flows well and is very well produced (as always).<br /><br />No better gift to the fans and their fallen band mate than to come full circle on this CD. This is a great reminder of the pure power of Deftones when they do it right. They have their focus back 100%. But, it must be said, they are as consistent as a band can be. Even their weakest efforts are excellent. There are just less throw out tracks on this CD. None in fact.<br /><br />Tied with Katatonia's 'Dead End Kings' for my top CD of 2012. No brainer. BUY.

B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Shinedown is an excellent band and this is an excellent way to receive CDs without having to go to the store.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I should have guessed from the Miley Cyrus recommendation that this book would be drivel. It attempts to be sexy, but just isn't. It's too contrived. I have no idea what all the hype is about. This is coming from someone who read, and liked, Twilight haha (however I wouldn't call that well written either, but it was at least mindlessly enjoyable).
B001DHXT2A|2.0|I love the movie but it did not have three disc as I thought.  The movie is in very good shape
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I love this movie, if you just want a simple full screen movie with not much else, this is what you need! Its very affordable and there is a little special feature. But the movie is what counts right? ;)
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|i love his work, im captivated and almost believe in these god, he makes them come alive. come on next book
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Surprisingly we rented this for our 4 boys at their request and they loved it. It really was a cute movie.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love these types of games I play alot of them this one is by far one of the best ive played
B002PEP4U0|5.0|Loved this book !  This is a great read for individuals of all ages.  It shows the power of perseverance, curiosity and education.  The power of knowledge and how it can change lives
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is much better that the film we all grew up with. In reading it I was beginning to fear a remake by the same guy who horribly remade Charley and the chocolate factory, the Nightmare before Xmas guy. That aside I was surprised at how short it was, for some reason I imagined it to be hundreds of pages longer, exciting fun read for all ages.
B0049P1VHS|3.0|For starters, I'll say that I've followed the Walking Dead comic series prior to viewing the show, but it hasn't colored my feelings that much.<br /><br />The first 4/6 episodes of this season are powerful, emotional, frightening and great.  I'm saying this in spite of the fact that many of the characters on the show are either wooden or unlikable.<br /><br />The series begins with a bang (literally) and races along in a rush for survival, but slams on the break by episode 5 (of 6).<br /><br />The production values on the show are film quality.  Things look great and feel real.  For the most part, the acting is good, but there are a few bad actors and they can unfortunately overpower scenes at times.<br /><br />If you're up for a show that's a little disturbing (not scary, disturbing) that takes you for a ride, this can be a good show.  While I'm not head over heels for it, I know I'll come back for more in subsequent seasons.
B009HSVHV2|5.0|i feel good about these fellows. i really enjoy keeping them as pets, and look forward to giving them a good home.
0375869026|5.0|My daughter asked for me to buy this for her - she had read it in school.  What a great book - she reads it every day to her younger sister!!  It has a wonderful message and it is simple enough for a 3rd/5th grader to read.
B0091REZMW|3.0|this game does seems a little slow at first but its early yet...i will be back to reevaluate...love the graphics and tutorial seemed helpful.
B009KKLQKO|4.0|My main gripe is the lack of songs. My other is that the audio is both heavily edited (especially Brian) and poorly recorded (in my opinion). I noticed several parts where what I heard Brian singing didn't match up to his mouth movements - and I was at this show in person and can confirm this from both memory and some iPhone footage I took myself. Honestly I think it is unnecessary to do this...Brian sounded fantastic at the show in person (perfect? of course not, the man is 70. but still excellent) and the extra pitch correction and re-recording of vocal parts/piping them in from other shows was not necessary for the instances I saw. Additionally, I suspect Isn't It Time used a lot of vocals from the album recorded version of this song...it sounded too perfect at parts. Additionally, I just think the sound is poorly mixed for a concert film. You can't hear the crowd at all and there is virtually no sound from the room...it just sounds like live recordings in a studio so the atmosphere of the concert is totally lost. The magic isn't there and the songs sound very thin. In person I can assure you this was not the case, so I blame the sound guys.<br /><br />That all being said, it's fairly solid, and their performances were great, although it was far better (and longer) in person.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|We have every Tinkerbell movie and decided to give this one a try - IT WAS AMAZING!!!!  Such a heart felt movie... my daughters have watched it at least 25 times now.  I'm glad I finally purchased the full movie with digital copy and blue ray.
B008BIZ06M|4.0|I think the title of the review summarizes it.<br />There aren't any true classics in here but still really enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I know the stories have a reputation for being super-dirty and yes- that is part of it, but just part! It's not just all sex - it's actually very interesting, and... hot, as Ana would say. Definitely not for tweens, though. The stories and the characters are as addictive and compelling as the Twilight series. And yes, there are many similarities/parallels between the two, but this trilogy is absolutely unique enough to hold its own. My favorite similarity is that I couldn't put them down!<br />The similarities between Twilight and this trilogy are mostly obvious, but do not at all interfere with my enjoyment of them. Mind you, I love the Twilight books. For example, the narrator, Ana, is slightly introverted and always biting her lip. She has never been attracted to anyone else until she meets Mr. Grey, who looks like a copper headed Greek God. Sounds very Bella-Edward, right? But the similarities are all superficial like that, not interfering with the otherwise original parts of the story.<br />I highly recommend getting all three books at once because you will want to start the next one IMMEDIATELY after the previous. As in, when one book ends you would not want to wait even a few minutes to start the next one.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am a physician and, if there is just one book I would recommend for everybody to read, it is this book. Unless you have an enlightened self educating physician treating you, this is required reading.
0553386794|2.0|With stacks of books at home and a brand new Kindle not yet out of the box, I found myself on a 10,000-mile flight without a book!  An admired friend of mine had read the entire \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" series, so I decided to give it a try.  At an airport bookstore I bought the first book of the series, and I soon regretted it.<br />I would place Martin in the same league of pop fiction writers as Grisham and Follett.  His style is flat, wordy, and immature; at least Grisham can weave an intriguing story.<br />Martin's characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting.  The good guys never seem to learn, and the bad guys never seem to grow.  The good guys are so stupid, make so many bad decisions, and are so easily duped by every trick, no matter how obvious, I no longer cared if they lived or died.  Fortunately, Martin kills them off nice and fast.<br />I finished the entire book and was relieved when I read the last word.  Unwilling to wade through more of Martin's bland writing but mildly curious as to the outcome of the series, I did an Internet search for some brief synopses.  After a few minutes of reading about the second book, I rolled my eyes and went on to something more gainful.  I am grateful that I did not read the entire series.<br />I am sorry that Time magazine proclaimed Martin \\"America's Tolkien.\\"  Is that the best we have to offer?  Sure, Raymond and Richard are Martin's middle names, but I begrudge the \\"R. R.\\" comparison with J. R. R. Tolkien.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|I really loved this story. I had read it to my son and daughter and they both liked the characters and the princess. Its a great message for kids and for my daughter; a really cute twist. I would recommend this story to anyone with young kids!
B009LUAR0I|5.0|Can't believe this album isn't a worldwide hit!<br />Best pop music i have heard in many many years.<br />From beggining to end this is a great album with no fillers!<br />I'm not a mika fan but I have listened to all of his albums.<br />To my taste first album was very good, the second one just good but not too much. But this one is twice as good as the first!<br />If you like mika previous albums you're definitely gonna love this.
0316228532|5.0|I definitely waited a while to read this one, and then had to give myself a day to recover after finishing it before I could attempt a review. Initially I scared myself into thinking it wouldn't live up to the standards of Harry Potter and I would come away feeling disappointed.<br /><br />Then I started the book and remembered what a brilliant WRITER Rowling is, not just storyteller. Yes, the world of Harry Potter is complex and amazing and magical, but this is a novel. Staggeringly human, flawlessly executed, and realistic in a way you don't often see in books by authors as well known as Rowling.<br /><br />You end up having some very strong emotion towards all of the many characters she introduces (and there are a LOT, but it makes it a more complicating and interesting read). Whether this is sympathy, hatred, adoration, or irritation is left completely up to you. Rowling narrations provides no bias for the characters, the reader is left to understand what kind of a person these characters are.<br /><br />I also LOVE how she utilized the different dialects. Let's face it, when reading anything that comes out of England I usually hear a posh Jane Austen voice in my head narrating, unless otherwise specified. Rowling made sure to differentiate between London voices, country voices, the lower class of the country voices. To an American reader, this gave me a MUCH stronger sense of the culture and how to relate each character to their community.<br /><br />Definitely don't finish this book on a day when you're feeling down though (like I did, and then cried for the last 50 pages and a subsequent hour after completion). The book is absolutely heartbreaking, in a way that makes you cry because you're sad and then cry again because of its truth, and then CONTINUE to cry because you feel so utterly human you want to go hug someone.<br /><br />Rowling is, and will always be, one of my top five favorite authors because not only can she create one of the most intricate fantasy worlds since Tolkien, but she can write a novel of astounding proportions that has the power to change the face of contemporary literature.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Many of the scenes in Magic Mike were awkward and unbelievable. Overall, the film was depressing. Perhaps the was its purpose. I just found the transitions between the love story and the rest of the content to be disjointed and unmoving. I gave it a three because I am guessing without any personal experience, that the dancing was authentic.
0156027321|5.0|I chose this book because of the movie advertisement. I also thought the book would be exciting along with a very good story line. The movie itself was wonderful.
B007L6VR12|3.0|DVD was purchased for a gift. I have not seen this movie therefore I cannot rate it one way or the other. DVD arrived to me as scheduled and was otherwise not defective.
B009IA3O2O|5.0|I've been a Kamelot fan for years always looking forward to their new releases I was concerned that after Roy decided to leave the band they wouldn't be able to find another singer with his vocal range to carry on. The thing I like about the new singer, Tommy Karevik, is that he can do justice to the old material and yet not be a Roy Khan clone. Kamelots music has always been superb, great songs, excellent musicianship, and stellar vocals. Listen to &#34;Song For Jolee&#34;, if you doubt the vocal skills of Tommy, incredible range. If you're a Kamelot fan give this one a listen, you wont be disappointed.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I got lost a couple of times, but as it turns out, that was part of the author's plan, resulting in a really COOL plot.  All of John Grisham's books are very good.  This one is excellent.  If you only read one of his books, make it this one.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|One of many recordings I have of the Beatles. I was skeptical when the CD arrived as to authenticity because it was shipped from Argentina. It appears to be authentic and not a pirated copy, which was my first concern. CD better than the old 33 1/3 LP record from so many years ago!

B006LR0XLM|4.0|I still need to figure out how best to use this but so far can see that it does just what it is supposed to do.  The only problem is that I don't always want to sinc all of the files available but that might be experimenting with it a bit.
B005HT400A|5.0|I first saw this film at an art house theater in New York.  It left an indelible impression.  Recently, I watched it again with my girlfriend, who had never seen the film (She is 26, I am 54). We were both in awe of the film's raw, sexual imagery.  The film is a study in sexual experimentation. We were \\"turned on\\" throughout the film.  I recommend this film as a post-dinner DVD. It will get you in the mood.

B009D5VNLS|4.0|I was somewhat hesitant about the reviews I read. But after watching this, I can say that it is a really nice movie. I missed the prince charming. Regardless of what some think is unnecessary, that is what fairy tales are, so I missed it. That said, I loved that she was her own person and she made the right decisions to get out of a bind. This is what I want my daughter to do, be her own person, making her own decision and then finding the perfect prince charming, because he will be an awesome guy that respects her. Loved it.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Excellent!  Kept your attention throughout!  Great love making dialog!!!!  I have read several of his books and they have all been excellent.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not a Stephen King fan? Me too! But having gone through the Kennedy Assassination events as a high school senior in 1963 I wanted to read about what all of us have fantasized about at least once. Changing History. King read everything about the events leading up to Dallas that had been previously published then combined fact and fiction together in such a way that I could not put this book down.
0345803485|5.0|I'm a fan!! Had to buy it hard copy so i can reread at any time. I just loved it!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am really enjoying this new series of books. I am a little out of the target audience perhaps, but Riordan tells a good story with likable characters. I just wish he wrote a little faster :)
0345803507|5.0|If you like romance novels, this is a great love story more than erotica. First one I ever read and I loved it. Enjoy!
B002UNMW7O|4.0|I wanted to see the next movie, and this was great. its weird seeing everyone old though. still love the guys.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|I watched the movie a few years ago and it was very nice. So when I saw my library had this available for kindle I didn't hesitate and borrowed it. I'm glad I did, this book is so full of feelings. People growing up and figuring out what to do with their lives, all while having that one special friend to share it with. Dex is right, sometimes we don't know what's staring us right at the face but some are lucky and figure it out before it's too late.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Everyone I know has seen it so I bought it for me to keep up.  It is so funny and sweet.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The set of Marvel Superhero movies has been mostly solid in recent history.  Robert Downy Jr's Iron Man quickly brought the character to wider audiences as beloved.  Captain America was brought to daylight by Chris Evans as the epitome of selfless heroism.  Thor came to life through Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of a proud God and warrior.  Black Widow and Hawkeye are new (although Hawkeye had a brief cameo in Thor), but are played well by Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner, respectively.  The Hulk/Bruce Banner up until now has had generally positive, but overall mixed reviews, as portrayed by Eric Bana and Edward Norton, who are now replaced by Mark Ruffalo.<br /><br />Ultimately, most of these characters were great in their own movies, but the charisma and chemistry of these actors/characters is far greater than could have been expected.  The Avengers, brought to us by Joss Whedon, brings this unlikely team of characters together through the organization SHIELD.  As you might expect, if you are familiar with Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America, these are some bold and strong-willed personalities coming together, and in that kind of situation, you have a lot of potential for conflict.  Mark Ruffalo plays a great understated Bruce Banner, and the animation of the Hulk character really reflects Ruffalo visually, which lends to the character's credibility.  His personality balances the team well, and the military backgrounds brought by Hawkeye and Black Widow offer more to the story than might be expected, when outshone by the rest of the team.<br /><br />Whedon excellently crafts these conflicts, playing the characters off one another well.  Bringing them together NATURALLY despite their conflicts is something that could have posed a great challenge, but Whedon finds a way to unify them without ever appearing to force its change.  Bringing together references from the entire Marvel Universe proves fairly successful, and even the small characters contribute to the story progression in their own ways.<br /><br />Ultimately there's little doubt that between the epic, heavy conflict, and the light-hearted comedic quips, Whedon has a great success on his hands.  For anyone interested in superhero action or the individual characters that have been crafted over the past several years, The Avengers is a must see.ry progression in their own ways.<br /><br />Ultimately there's little doubt that between the epic, heavy conflict, and the light-hearted comedic quips, Whedon has a great success on his hands.

B009AMALGM|2.0|As a huge fan of the series, I had high hopes for this Paranormal Activity 4. Instead, it was a lackluster film that didn't make much sense. The best scenes were at the end of the movie and were about half a second long, literally. I loved Paranormal Activity 1, 2, and 3, but I couldn't find one thing that I liked in this movie. It just bored me to death and moved along at a snail's pace. If you're not really into the series, I'd skip this one and just read a summary on-line because it's truly a waste of time.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|At school when ever I wanted to get on the computer, all the computers were being used so later that night I went home and got on my kindle fire and I searched Powerpoint and this app showed up on so I tried the free version and it had exactly what I needed, but in order to use it I had to have the full version but it costed $14.95 so for my b-day I asked for the full version of Documents To Go and my mom said yes, so right when I got it I took it to my teacher and showed her all about it, and from then on insted of using the computers I got approval from the teacher that I could use my kindle fire in class, writing ALL kinds of cool stories...  &iexcl;THX DataViz, Inc &iexcl;...
B0010X8NF0|5.0|The Darjeeling Limited is in my top 5 favorite movies. The cast are great and all act well together. The story is funny, dramatic at times, and just wonderful overall. If you haven[t seen this, I highly recommend you check it out!
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Only problem I have with these series of books is that once you start reading you can't put it down!
B000VHPZ3O|5.0|I missed this for so long.  Waited way to long to replace it.  One of my most favorite albums.  Yup.
B00979CS50|3.0|people do eventually get old. the 27 minute first song is like one big 10 minute song full of great big brush strokes that take too long and say too little. Walk like a Giant should have been left off of the disc. I turn it off whenever it comes on the radio. The 4 minute songs are great, and the 16 minute one is good, but the lyrics say nothing. Sonically, it is good old crunchy Crazy Horse, but Pedro doesn't get a lot of solos. It,s good for a driving trip, where you want something on that you like, but don't want to have to pay a lot of attention to it. I get really tired of Nicky Minaj and Maroon 5 after awhile from my daughter.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|I like the locations - Cambridge, London and Sussex/Brighton - and the time period and subject matter.  Also the main characters, and the well-designed story.
0525953728|5.0|Much prefer this account to the movie that was released later.Serious concerns about the future  security of the men of Team Six and the lack of concern by releasing their involvement. How is it our Society allows a classified mission to be used as a publicity event?

B009NOVCSS|2.0|I was going to buy the super delux version, instead bought the deluxe 3 cd set of GRRR, this is what I've found out...Love the music, packaging really cool, remastering is amazing...the BBC tracks are cool and nostalgic, they would have been a nice edition to the regular delux 3 cd set I bought. Personally as far as the sound of this new release, my 2009 remaster reissues are just fine in the sound department. Possibly I might get the super deluxe edition when it goes way down in price, only reason because I'm a stones completist, as I really don't need it. Things that should have been done with this insanely priced box set: #1.should have had 100 songs, BBC tracks remain seperate on one cd, a few more BBC tracks would have been nice. I'll guess will have to wait for the next over priced gem to get those other BBC releases. Anyway here is # 2.NO SONG EDITS!!!!!! leave them as the songs were   meant to be!!!! Being an audiophile nothing irritates me   more than edited tracks!! #3.The book should have had notes on each song, recording and release dates, of course all the tracks would be in chronological order.  #4. Each cd should be used close to its 80 minute limit, not 55-70 minutes of music on each cd like on this Grrr 3 cd set. Another slap in the hardcore stones fans face. The stones did this because they want new fans to have to buy all their albums, trust me Mick and Keith even if you used the four suggestions above on this Grrr box set, trust me and believe me (SCOUTS HONOR) the newbies would'nt be getting all of your catolouge output and most likely would buy most of your cds, mp3s, vinyl, etc. Another irritant, could the Stones have put the 7 ep 45 on cd #5 with the BBC Recordings. I do like the 7 vinyl, but it would have been nice to have it put on cd to. TRUST ME, brother Mick your cash registers would not stop cha--chinging!! I could wax on about this over priced gem of brilliance, Yada yada yada yada.... but I will spare the masses of torture. I like many Stones fans have invested thousands into this band, it would have been nice to give us  fans a super deluxe box set with the four suggestions I've stated above. If your a newbie than by all means get the cheaper 3 cd deluxe set of GRRR. I wish amazon would list how sales are doing for this insanley priced, wrongly done, insult to the long time fans, box set. Hey... I have all my Stones cds to listen to... I'm glad these guys are still touring. I still feel [[ASIN:B002KV72OE A Bigger Bang]] might be the best stones album since [[ASIN:B0039TD7RC Exile on Main Street]] or [[ASIN:B001WCN232 Goat's Head Soup (Reis)]]...just my opinion.. TRUST ME I REALLY LOVE THE STONES.. this box set just irritates me with all its careless short offerings as well as it should most hardcore stones fans.. Ps: Another slap, well at least in the American stones fans face is that in the Japanese version of this box set, it contains the lyrics for all 89 tracks in a seperate paper book in both Japanese and English. Anyway long live the Stones...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Found this show this year and was blown away by how great it is. We are big fans now! It could show on tv today and I think it would have take off as a hit. Its a shame fox didn't promote it or give it a chance.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Great movie.  Some of the reviews gave me pause, but finally lept and bought here at Amazon.  Great flick!  I'm very familiar with all the other Alien movies by this director, and am a fan of those.  But, I went into it with an open mind -- \\"let's just let this one tell its story.\\"  Does not disappoint!  Felt it provided sound foundation for the \\"later\\" (earlier produced) Alien stories.<br /><br />Strikingly beautiful imagery.  Engaging storyline, very great cast and crew, excellent production.  Very pleased.<br /><br />I can now appreciate why some others were turned off by this, I see/understand what they were saying as I review the plot and such, but yet that did not impact the performance (or rather my experience of it) one iota.  Loved it.  Great Sci Fi action delivered!<br /><br />This is a keeper.  I have watched it about 5 times now in the first month.  This repeated viewing did not \\"wear out\\" the enjoyment or the experience.
0545425115|5.0|The whole family loved this book including grandfather. My nine year old started reading it but he began to have nightmares so we put an end to it for now. He will surely read it when he is ready.
B00004RJ71|4.0|This was educational and at times difficult to watch.  I guess it's not my genre, but I have to give credit where it's due.  Superb acting, intriguing story line, realistic too I reckon, slightly dated, but a great production effort.  Saw it and own it on DVD from Amazon, was recommended by a friend to expand my view on Hispanic culture, and that it did.<br /><br />A bit depressing at times, but I guess that's the price of realism?  However, if you like movies about doing crime, doing time, and all the stuff that goes with it, then this is for you. I think I'm richer for having seen it.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|After watching firefly and being bummed about not having another season to watch, I was thrilled to find this movie and it helped me with some closure .
0316228532|1.0|I was looking forward to this book. I thought it had the possibility to be great having read all the Harry Potter books and expecting the same depth of plot and richness of characters. However I found Barry Fairweather's death disappointingly early.  The teens lacked authenticity. The adults were confusingly indistinct in some parts of the book and local politics are just not that thrilling. The plot was enough for a short story but not for a book. Rowling used her usual rich description but I found myself wanting more story line.  I bought it at the airport and put it down well before the end of my eight hour flight...
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Story line was OK, but author spent more time on wisecracking of John Corey and less on actual plot. Entire book could be condensed into 2 chapters. Ending was good but predictable.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Generally buy whatever Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, and a few others put out.  It's Van Morrison, what's not to like?

B009KHDT0C|1.0|I was expecting it to be funnier. I would suggest skipping this movie since it didn't deliver what I thought.
B009SCRERI|4.0|This was a great fairy movie and my 3-year old granddaughter loves watching it repeatedly. Tinkerbell and the rest of the fairy cast are just as intriguing and delightful as ever. The movie provides a nice escape for a rainy day with hot cocoa!!!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This movie appeals to a narrow group of sci fi lovers. It has great visuals and graphical design work. After watching additional movie scenes on this blu ray that were cut from the original theatrical version I question &#34;why weren't some left in&#34;?..... they could have really added to the depth of the movie. Also I wish they would have better pursued the theme of &#34;creation vs evolution&#34; as that is one thing that really stands out in this prequel.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|Cool Hand Luke<br />My favorite Paul Newman movie!<br />Has that classic line &#34;What we have here, is failure to communicate&#34;!<br />A must see!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is amazing and I love it long time.  It's fun enough without a stylus, but having a stylus and the kindle screen makes the drawing feel much more real.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|I bought two sets for it's potential collectable status down the road.<br /><br />I already had all but one of the vinyl albums in my possession that were purchased separately back in the latter part of the 1970's. They were all Imports from England, and all in Stereo. Yes, All in Stereo, including the first four albums (making the description of this box set untrue with it's claim of being the US debut of the first four albums in Stereo).<br /><br />I was lucky in that I didn't receive one of the bad batches.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This album will give you an idea why Johnny is a punk icon.  Sticking it to the man right in his own crib.
0446580848|4.0|Quick, entertaining read. I personally would put this in the middle of Mr. DeMille's books as far a quality goes. I read this 600 page book in about 3 days.<br /><br />Set in Yemen about 3 yrs after the Cole bombing, John and his wife Kate are pressed into helping, i.e. becoming bait, to capture or kill one the authors of the Cole bombing.<br /><br />While the story is told from Corey's view point, Paul Brenner from The General's Daughter and Up Country is a major supporting character.<br /><br />If you have read the Corey novels - his view point of the CIA hasn't changed and more evidence to support that view is added. Double and triple crosses are rampant.<br /><br />To sum up, DeMille probably won't win any converts, but if you like the Corey series, you'll probably like this.
B005K17RU0|4.0|good app simple to use and gets the job done. no issues happy i got it and would recamend to a friend.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Like being able to access my email easily on my Kindle.  Wish it were easier to set up multiple email accounts.
B005LAIGNC|5.0|I was really impressed with the story line in this movie.  It told the story without a lot of violence.  I learned so much about this group from watching this movie and I was so impressed with the actors.  The footage from the aircrafts was so real and this movie kept our attention from the beginning to the end.  My wife watched the entire movie with me and she cried at the end because she thought the movie was so touching.  If you are looking for a feel good movie that's still good for the entire family, get this movie.  This was our first Blu-ray movie and it was just like HD.  You can tell that a lot of hard work went into this movie to make it a classic.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Really like the ability to read this on my Kindle.  I admit I get lazy picking up my Bible, but this makes it accessible and it allows book marking. Thanks for making it available.

B005VGMYZM|5.0|Surprise. The begining is an every day Andre DVd. With a problem with artificial snow . I was going to stop it and shelved, but somehow we continued viewing it. The second part is excellent but the Third part is a diamond. The best moments in any of Andre's DVDs. A must see. I have seen this part several times. There are two surprises and the award given to him by the Austrian Government. The location is incredible beautiful. There is a fourth part which is highligths of different shows in different countries. But the Award ceremony and the two surprises of the Third part makes this DVD one of Andre's best.<br />Enjoy.

B0088RQ4X4|4.0|They got the gravity problem that someone from Earth would have right or close enough. The fight John Carter joined with the native tribe spoke to times past here on Earth. One of the things said in the late 1800's by the Native American tribes about the Civil War was to just wait and they will destroy eachother. John Carter was a reluctant hero as true heros are. Wars have been fought for far less than the cause taken up as his own. I just wish they could have explained why Mars had water, breathable air, and why they were not fried by the solar winds. I have to remember this was written in 1912 when they thought Venus was a lush jungle. We have learned much since then. Just forget it's Mars and enjoy the story. It makes you think about what you would fight for. Like Freedom.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|Bought this for my husband because he's a wildlife lover, and he enjoys the DVD so much he's watched it several times.
B000Q79HS8|4.0|I love these types of action thrillers and this Bourne movie did not disappoint.  I was on a flight when I watched this and the time passed by like nothing as I watched this movie.
B005LAIHQS|3.0|When MEN IN BLACK first came out, Will Smith could do no wrong.  Fast forward a decade, and it's a slightly different picture.  MEN IN BLACK II proved that not even the genius combination of Smith and Tommy Lee Jones could save a film.  And of course there were Smith's more dramatic turns, which failed to wholly entertain (even if he had proved himself a good actor).<br /><br />The question you should be asking by this point in the Will Smith timeline is this: is MIB3 entertaining?  You can throw aside \\"good\\" automatically; if you come into this film with too high expectations, you will simply be setting yourself up for disappointment.  But can this film still entertain?<br /><br />Well, about as good as any film involving senseless time travel can.  Agent K disappears; for some reason, J is the only one who remembers him.  So J travels into the past, where he encounters a younger J (Josh Brolin), and the pair team up to stop a time-hopping assassin (Boris the Animal) who managed to escape from a prison on the moon.<br /><br />So...well, there you have it.  Smith is still in good form; he seems a little tired (and Jones seems a LOT tired), but you can't really blame them by now.  As Boris, Jamaine Clement brings some delicious overacting.  The character is poorly scripted--his dialogue is painful--but Clement clearly relishes the role.  The real ace in the hole is Josh Brolin, as the younger K: Brolin gives a dead-on impersonation of Jones, and yet manages to add his own stamp on the film.<br /><br />Director Barry Sonnefeld and writer Etan Cohen still know how to have a good, effects-laden time.  Is MIB3 as good as the first?  Of course not.  But it's probably better than the second, and certainly offers up a good romp for anyone who likes their action with a little humor and a dollop of zaniness.  That being said, let's hope the gang leaves well enough alone, and doesn't offer up a fourth entry in the series.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|I watched this movie on a plane which made it all the better (watch it and you'll know why).  It was a very intense movie and entertaining to watch.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  don't let the length deter you, it is well written and kept me wanting more.  I read it on kindle and was thankful for that due to its size in its standard form.
B009UMTMKS|5.0|I purchased the book to take Steve Blanks online course at Udacity. I also purchased the Kindle version since it's easier to take with me to Starbucks, ect.<br /><br />If you are interested in starting your own business, this is required reading. I have started several small businesses over the last 35 years and I wish this was available back then. Absolute must for startups.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Now this was quite the game to play. Pretty easy but the graphics and the story kept my attention. I will place this game among my top 5.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show is so funny.  They did a great job of casting the actors for this sitcom.  I will be buying all the seasons.
1442359315|5.0|I loved this book.  It gives insight to what is waiting on the other side.  This story is very enlightening.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|We watched \\"Lawless\\" because of the actors that are in it.  Tom Hardy, Shia LeBeouf, Guy Pierce, and Jessica Chastain.  And we weren't disappointed!  The movie kept a great pace throughout and held our interest.  The ensemble cast worked really well together.  The only thing I will say is that there are a few graphic scenes in the movie, so if you're a little squeamish about those tyoe of things, be prepared to close your eyes a couple of times.
B00A3AUGEW|2.0|Phillip Phillips releases 2012's [[ASIN:B009NPA3MS World From the Side of the Moon]] off of notoriety based on winning the most recent American Idol season and off the popularity of his crowing single used during the Olympics \\"Home.\\" Indeed those triumphs certainly aided in promoting the southern boy's debut, which bowed at no. 4 with 169,000 copies - not too shabby. While the support is there, World From The Side of The Moon is an album that will be more embraced by 'fans' from the show as opposed to say new fans.  World From The Side of the Moon certainly isn't the most dreadful album of 2012, but neither is it a 'second coming' as suggested by some freely endorsing it with 5 star reviews.  The main issue with this effort is the identity crisis that Phillips suffers - who is the real Phillip Phillips? Too much of the album seems to imitate the cues of Dave Matthews, Mumford & Sons, and previous/current artists in those respective styles. Add some 'raw' songwriting by Phillips that could use some tweaks to better lay on the effort as a whole, and The World From the Side of the Moon has some issues.<br /><br />The first three cuts of the album are the strongest and set up World From the Side of the Moon with great promise.  \\"Man on the Moon\\" opens with rhythmic acoustic guitar work and establishes a sound harmonic progression. A Phillips original, \\"Man on the Moon\\" is the best of Phillips's songwriting.  Phillips channels his 'idol' Matthews, but manages to gie an overall capable performance. The chorus is wordy, but you can't deny the poetry of the lyrics: \\"Hold on it won't take long/you can find yourself if you decide to finally start/but don't look to me when you fall/because the steps get bigger so go ahead and walk them off/you know how I feel/so don't let your life start to waste away...\\"<br /><br />\\"Home\\" is an easy home run for Phillips, a record that continues to grow on you with successive listens.  Vocally, Phillips sounds his most polished, a comment not often associated with the anti-melodic singer throughout American Idol.  Drawing from Mumford & Sons, \\"Home\\" does something that later tracks fail to do - sound distinctly Phillip Phillips and not a copycat of some other artist.<br /><br />The final gem of the trio is \\"Gone, Gone, Gone,\\" a song with strong songwriting structure and memorable chorus: \\"For you for you/baby I'm not movin' on/I'll love you long after you're gone...\\" If there is a quibble, the overall sound seems a bit too light - and that's nitpicking ultimately.<br /><br />The album begins to 'lose' its strength following \\"Man On the Moon,\\" \\"Home,\\" and \\"Gone, Gone, Gone.\\" \\"Hold On\\" marks the beginning of Phillips's identity crisis as he overreaches in channeling Matthews, particularly in his lower register.  Another original, the songwriting itself overreaches for serious thematic material causing it to become bland, background music.<br /><br />\\"Tell Me A Story\\" fails to atone for \\"Hold On,\\" feeling even more like a generic Dave Matthews cut.  A bit over dramatic, Phillips again tries 'too hard' here, evidenced particularly on the chorus: \\"Alone is the street where you found me/scared of what's behind you/ scared of what's in front...\\" Both \\"Hold On\\" and \\"Tell Me A Story\\" don't capture the magic of the trio that captivates the beginning of the album, which is unfortunate.<br /><br />\\"Get Up Get Down\\" is an improvement, particularly given a quicker pace.  Hurting the 'B' cut it feels like Dave Matthews, epitomized.  Very much like cuts I reviewed from Dave Matthew Band's [[ASIN:B008FERRFO Away From The World (Deluxe Version)]], the horns and riffs characterize the cut.  Sure, this is a Phillip Phillips co-written cut on a Phillip Phillips album and not Dave Matthews, but in an industry like music where a balance between individual and conformity, the record may not sound 'distinctly' like Phillip Phillips as opposed to his influences.<br /><br />\\"Where We Came From,\\" the second single, executes more similar to tracks 1-3.  There is clear songwriting form and Phillips sounds more like only Phillip Phillips.  Part of the reason for this is that he ascends into his more melodic upper register, which allows for him to show of a more distinct voice and more personality, particularly on the memorable pre-chorus/chorus: \\"Climb the mountain, swim for the shore/bring it back to how it was before//take it out, blow it up/ignite the memory in between us...\\" \\"Where We Came From\\" is within the top four of the effort.<br /><br />\\"Drive Me\\" features some solid pieces (more of a rock sound, instrumental ideas, and chorus), but also has some flaws. Phillips's voice is inconsistent, particularly throughout the verses.  While the saxophone solo is nice, it is predictable because it takes listeners directly back to a firmly established Dave Matthews Band.<br /><br />Follow-up cut \\"Wanted Is Love\\" initiates as what sounds as if it will be a ballad, but the gargantuan refrain plays spoils to that notion. Again, Phillips writes/sings loftily here: \\"Wanted is love, not going insane/you know you've got to hold onto what you love before it's gone away...\\" It's ok, but as with so much of World From the Side of the Moon, its not necessarily memorable. \\"Can't Go Wrong\\" again lacks artistic distinction, borrowing Mumford & Son's signature rhythmic banjo on the chorus.  More against this cut is over repetition and again Phillips 'trying too hard' to evoke emotion.<br /><br />Penultimate cut \\"A Fool's Dance\\" is characterized by rhythm by the guitars, a feature that is overdone throughout this album.  Again, there are some sound pieces in place (background vocals, foreboding strings), but along with the 'good' comes 'bad.' While only marginally lengthy at 4:33, the cut feels too drawn out and ultimately lacking focus.  Closing cut \\"So Easy\\" sports Phillips's surprising falsetto as a highlight, but suffers similarly from over repetition and feeling 'too serious' and 'lofty.'<br /><br />All-in-all, [[ASIN:B009NPA3MS World From the Side of the Moon]] is as clunky as its title. As suggested throughout this critique, there are many promising 'pieces' that shine through this debut. Unfortunately aside from ace-in-the-hole \\"Home\\" and a few other standouts, the rest of the album is flawed.  Phillips sings ok, certainly with more sense of melody than while on American Idol, but the charisma he could showcase on live TV doesn't translate to the oft humdrum material of The World From the Side of the Moon.imilar to tracks 1-3.  There is clear songwriting form and Phillips sounds more like only Phillip Phillips.  Part of the reason for this is that he ascends into his more melodic upper register, which allows for him to show of a more distinct voice and more personality, particularly on the memorable pre-chorus/chorus: \\"Climb the mountain, swim for the shore/bring it back to how it was before//take it out, blow it up/ignite the memory in between us...\\" \\"Where We Came From\\" is within the top four of the effort.<br /><br />\\"Drive Me\\" features some solid pieces (more of a rock sound, instrumental ideas, and chorus), but also has some flaws.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|are you kidding?  after reading the reviews, really? Its fantastic! Its a GREAT read, why anyone would snob it off as being written by a teenager is beyond me, teenager? Who knew this much about sex when you were a teen?  I think it will be something that will prompt a teenager who never reads to be interested in reading and that's reason enough to love this book, did anyone read \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" because you heard it was steamy or forbidden?  Its an awesome book, I'm female, I'm 50 and I have a grandchild on the way and my daughter says there are more babies being born this year and the OB-Gyn's are calling the \\"Grey babies\\" If youre a writer, try and make that impact and have someone say its written by a teenager....and its probably really helped the sex lives of many people....stop being such literary snobs! reading is entertainment. This woman wrote a great book our kids will remember and it might even prompt some students to aspire to become writers, I think its brilliant the way she uses her \\"inner goddess\\" to add depth to our vision of how she feels, she's 21, she's a virgin and she's adorable in every way and Christian Grey represents a GOOD person with a very interesting conflict! and he's the kind of fantasy guy ALL women really want to have falling at their feet, (less the kinky but without the conflict ~ snore...) its a great book! read it...get your 16 plus aged teenager to read it too!  LOVED it!
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|The female talent that has come out of the UK within the past few years is astounding, Adele, Leona Lewis, Corrine Bailey Rae, to name just a few,  and now Rebecca Ferguson has joined those ranks.  I am eagerly looking forward to her next release and hope it is soon.  Do yourself a favor and listen to a few of her songs and then buy the CD.
B005QBBC2S|5.0|Leaving Las Vegas is one of those films that gets under your skin - and stays there. It's a dark story of two damaged people who live without apologies and on the very edge of despair. For Nicholas Gage this his tour de force performance - he's simply briliant as is Elizabeth Shue in a heart wrenching performance that's equally brave and unforgettable.<br /><br />Well written, directed and deeply compelling - Leaving Las Vegas is one of those films that leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. What is more, you'll be haunted by the story long after the movie ends. This is excpetional story telling at it's best and a must see for most any film buff.
B007V5XT1O|5.0|I am &#34;Blown Away&#34; by this CD, Carrie Underwood has grown so much as a singer/songwriter in the last two years and it shows, not only in the strength of her voice but in the songs she sings.  Now when she sings about abuse and broken hearts, you believe she knows of what she sings and she's not afraid to sing about anything.  If you are a Carrie Underwood fan, do yourself a favor and buy this one.
B0083GQVOC|5.0|A huge fan of of Tilda Swinton I was eager to see this film. The perfomances are superb and Miss Swinton is at the top of her game with a fearless, heart wrenching perfomrance. A topical story that hits home due to so many recent outbursts of violence - and the aftermath of a family torn apart by it.<br /><br />This is first rate story telling, compelling, frightening and heart wrenching, this is one hidden gem that should not be overlooked.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The resolution is low, no zen garden, no Survival mode. I would not recommend this  to anyone. Wait for the HD version.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Very strange book.  The story line jumped from character to character and past to present.  The characters overall had no redeeming qualities and I could not like any of them.  Fairly well written but missed the mark.
B005R32L66|5.0|I love Skype husband in AZ we Skype almost every day much easier than before now I don't miss him as much lol
B000VDDWDS|3.0|This is a good reference tester for surround systems, but the movie itself is iffy as well as the quality of the blu ray.  Just my opinion!
B0091REZMW|3.0|It's a generic search game. There's a timer for some of the puzzles and I personally do not like that. I would have preferred a zen mode to be available.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|this was a great movie in the theaters and it is even better on my couch with a great surround system.  Love it!
B00899DR40|5.0|It's a nice/ fun mix to keep u moving while doing mundane tasks like cleaning, or cooking. I like it.

B007HACDLK|5.0|THIS book is awesome and the whole series is fantastic...if  you liked Jack Bauer on 24, you will love this book and the entire series, no nonsense former special forces bad ass who has no time for bureaucratic bullshit!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I was hoping this game would be like the original game I downloaded on my DSi.  However, it is only about creating buildings and adding friends.  I just wanted to play the game not ask friends to play yet another game.  So without asking friends to play I am basically stuck at the level I am at.  Such a dissappointment from my earlier experience on my DSi.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app. Theres nothing wrong with it but when I play it sometimes freezes I think its just my kindle. But, if it isnt i hope theu get it fixed!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was amazing and written well, but the ending was horrible. I can't wait a whole year to see what happens. I would recommend this to anyone.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Surprisingly absorbing. Also thought provoking. I couldn't put it down.  I am left with huge admiration for these ultra runners.
B0000024RB|5.0|He has such a wonderful voice, I enjoyed him on TV in the 1960's and in Branson, MO.  This CD has so many of his best songs and I find it relaxing to listen to while driving.
B00881PPTO|3.0|It's good to find a hotel last minute but prices could be better. Worked on My HTC EVO 4 g.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Recieved this Blue-Ray on time and with no cracks or scuffs on the case.  Also got it on cyber monday for only $9! SCORE!  Very pleased with this purchase.  I know that my boyfriends 6 year old Niece will LOVE this for her birthday. =D
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was so excited to read this book.  I find myself finding anytime I can to read even a few pages.  Not even finished but love every page I read!
B0073O8BOS|4.0|A lot more calm than the first album was but this is an extremely well made album from start to finish. I enjoy what both vocalists bring to the table. If you like baby darling dollface honey you will like this album. Different sound and feel to the album, but both albums stand alone perfectly. I can't wait for more from them.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|I love this movie for children. Its very encouraging and seem to get their attention pretty quickly. My grandkids love it!!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This is a must have for iPad.  So easy to use, just plug in and import! Wish I would have ordered sooner to have in time for vacation. Fast and easy to upload pics and clear the memory card, eliminates the need to have extra cards for the camera.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I love this movie for children. Its very encouraging and seem to get their attention pretty quickly. My grandchildren loves it!!
B008KWHL6G|5.0|On the recommendation of my favorite barista, I checked out this recording by Two Gallants. I bought it for my sister for Christmas and I'm sure she'll love it.
B0009MAO46|5.0|I love this movie for children. Its very encouraging and seem to get their attention pretty quickly. My grandkids loves it. Its well worth the buy and at a  good price.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Another winner for Pixar.  Recommend Parents to watch with their children as the storyline touches upon a subject that we are often too proud to address
B007HACDLK|5.0|The book held your interest from start to the end.  Suspense all the way through the book.<br />I finished the book in two days, because you cannot lay it down.<br />Once again Mitch Rapp takes down the bad guys.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A funny, insightful action filled drama played out on the surface of Mars.<br />The struggles Mark goes through are believible and sometimes downright terrorising.<br />A great read to keep your mind off the nonsense happening in the real world.
1440503257|5.0|Great for any Harry Potter lover. My daughter originally checked it out at the library and couldn't get enough of it so we thought we would purchase it for her to have along with the entire Harry Potter books, wands etc. If your child loves Harry Potter, this book is a must have! :-)
B004TBWFAO|5.0|One of the great texts of modernist literature with extraordinary apercus on the problems of artistic creation and the ephemeral yet enduring quality of human relationships.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|After they changed the logo background from purple to yellow and the can from yellow to red, my shop stopped working. Anytime I try to use the shop, it says there is an unexpected error. What do I do to fix this???? :( :( :(
B008KNUKVI|5.0|I love Pentatonix. They almost sound like an actual band! I loved them since the Sing-off and I have everyone of their songs and supported them all the way! So talented :) This is my brother's Christmas present
B008602KQI|4.0|Great movie.  A lot of suspense and I loved that Katniss was the heroine!  Jennifer Lawrence did a great job of playing her.  Am going to watch it again.
B004GHNHVW|3.0|First let me say I've been a huge Paul Simon fan since buying a vinyl copy of \\"There Goes Rhymin' Simon\\" when I was 9. I enjoyed each and every album he made because every one was completely different than the previous one. You never knew where he was going to go musically. This amazed me because each new album sounded fresh and unique to listen to. This one...doesn't do that. What amazes me, is that his previous work, \\"Surprise\\" was received with less favorable reviews than this one. I loved \\"Surprise\\"! I thought Brian Eno's contribution was important but yet it didn't deter from Paul's musicianship. The collaboration worked and still sounded fresh. I must admit, I feel his self-titled album, \\"Hearts and Bones\\", \\"Rhythm of the Saints\\", and \\"Surprise\\" are his best works. I agree with most of the comments about this album. What's suffering the most is the lack of melody. I think having Phil Ramone produce the album may not have been the right move. I think Paul himself would've done a better job. The sound is dead and without resonance or ambiance throughout the album. I'm not knocking Mr. Ramone; he's a legendary producer with decades of experience and has worked with Paul Simon, Billy Joel, and many other artists with success. Due to the stripped down instrumentation and lack of melody, a different sonic approach should have been used. Think of what \\"Surprise\\" would've sounded like without Brian Eno. Paul Simon has always been successful when collaborating with another artist or musicians. The album HAS been acclaimed to being the best work Paul's done since \\"Graceland\\". I don't agree with that, but hey, everyone deserves to have a bad apple once in a while. Who knows? Maybe I'll listen to this album in 10 years and will love it. I'll be in touch :)
B000ZNQEMU|5.0|Women love it. A good conversation starter. The service was great and the product was great. v v v v v
B0018OFN1S|5.0|First of the series and is a great movie about street racers and loyalty between 2 friends one is a undercover cop the other a thief/street racer.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This is a nicely made 3D movie with none of the &#34;jump out at the audience&#34; gimmicks.  I have seen the movie in regular blu ray in the past, and can honestly say the 3D just made it more enjoyable.  The 3D in this movie enhance the depth of things I overlooked in the 2D version but it does not overwhelm the viewer with unnecessary fluff.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|A modern day Linda Ronstadt.Most of these songs are very upbeat,and what I classify as &#34;Feel good music&#34;.I play it a lot.If you like Shania.Don't let this one get away!
1451695195|1.0|No mention of Jesus Christ as the Way the Truth and the Life, no one comes to the Father except through Him. Also, he claims there is no Hell. That also is a LIE. There is a Hell and the only way to escape is place faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. This guy did not go to heaven and he did not converse with angels or God. The message he is conveying is a lie and a deception. DONT BE DECEIVED PEOPLE.
B00005R5G9|4.0|A little fantasy, humor and romance all rolled in to one movie. The price was right,and came very timely.A good movie for your collection!
B005LAIHSG|2.0|I wanted to rate this with one star, but I threw in a pity one for poor Chris and Charlize, stuck with trying to carry the movie since Stewart so obviously could not.<br /><br />Stewart's acting is bad. Not hilariously bad like Nic Cage, but just painful to watch in a general sense. While relieved she didn't do her trademark lip biting that seems to be her facial expression of choice, I nevertheless found myself literally yelling at the tv, \\"For god's sake, close your freakin' mouth!\\" Maybe she had a severe cold for the duration of shooting the movie and couldn't breathe through her nose. I don't know. But it was so distracting that at one point I had to leave the room. The creepy part is the vacant, dead-eyed stare she has with everything. No one is home. I am convinced her body is an empty shell being animated by some high tech computer program.<br /><br />The plot is riddled with so many holes that characters became lost in them. The special effects wavered back and forth between interesting (Ravenna reverting back to human form after the flock of birds) to cringe inducing (the whole white stag ripoff from Princess Mononoke). I just don't get what direction this movie was headed. I believe this movie could have been improved upon 100% by having Ravenna as the main character, and further exploring what made her the way she was. We get bits and pieces, and Charlize Theron could have easily pulled it off (with a less hokey script than she was presented with here). Hell, I'd take a movie that was all about The Huntsmen as opposed to what we got.<br /><br />My only hope is that there is no sequel... but that is a vain hope in the land of Hollywood greed...
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|The movie was great and had a good story line that even my 3 year old could follow.  The animation was fantastic, even in Standard Definition.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|this is a decent prequel to the first season. i liked it and was entertained by the plot, character development, and of course,  the sexual tension.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a very good can't put it down book. I like that I can order and goes straight to my kindle.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I feel like the bare minimum was done when this app was put here. You can only see about a dozen posts and nothing beyond that. And halfway down it won't show pictures. Fix this please.
0525953728|4.0|It is very interesting book, that will hold your attention till the last page.<br /><br />Well written and informative, highly recommended.
0345803485|1.0|I'm so confused how anyone could even appreciate this story. I mean, if you're into sexual content pick up any romance novel on the shelf. If you like the kinky stuff try Lora Leigh; she's at least good at telling a realistic-ish story with MANLY characters! This book series was a joke. I thought Christian, aside from being anywhere close to realistic (a billionaire at 26? Really? BILLIONAIRE?) he was a pansy and annoying and Ana was just stupid. Personally men with mommy issues are not attractive to me. Gross. I read the entire first book, most of the second, hoping it might get better and skimmed through the last book and read the last chapter. Why, pray tell, did it take 3 books to tell such a ridiculous story? The writing is amateur. The characters are just plain annoying. I wish I could have those hours spent reading this back. I also wish I hadn't bought all three books at the same darn time. tsk. I actually get annoyed by the attention this horrible series gets because there are so many other authors who actually are good at writing who deserve the attention!
B008EL4YX6|1.0|I got this app free as the app of the day and it was very disappointing.  I don't know how they pick their free apps for the day but this once was a bad choice.  I wouldn't download it.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Easy read with interesting characters. Forest gump meets European vacation. Really enjoyed this book. Read it for our book club.
B004SBULWE|5.0|Since android does not have the option to close the applications (at least most applications do not close) this product helps to manage the ram on your device
B009NOVCTM|5.0|I think I will pass on Grrr because I own all the songs on it in various forms. I think a more interesting collection to put out on a two CD set are the best tracks from Steel Wheels to A Bigger Bang. These are very good albums that don't get the recognition they deserve so to put the best track on a two CD set would be a nice way of showcasing the best of these later day Rolling Stone albums. Call it The Best of The Rolling Stones 1989 to 2005. Certainly there is enought good material there to make this worth while. What do you think of this idea? I welcome your opinions.
B008AT9XOC|5.0|Little Shop of Horrors: The Director's Cut is a must have to all of those who grew up with the original release with the Oh, so happy ending. After doing a research project on all the versions of this film back in college, I always wondered why they changed the ending and the explanation is thorough in the director commentary.
B00008IHN1|5.0|Great movie, funny and in good taste.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves music, especially drums.  Nice way to spend family time laughing and being entertained.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I purchased a new Macbook Pro recently and of course it has Firewire 800 and my old external hard drive only runs Firewire 400.  So sent for this hoping it would work.  Wow did it.  Simply plug your old Firewire 400 into the adapter...the adapter into your Firewire 800 port on your mac. It recognized my hard drive instantly.  And was able to transfer all my old files.  It is very fast and everything moved flawlessly.  I cannot recommend this product enough.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I'm so happy to get all Kelly's hits... I know every song even though I didn't realize some were her.  A strong collection and definately worth adding to your collection... especially if you were on the fence about adding all her CD's.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book and love the story...one of his best. Actually had a moving love story mixed in with the suspense.
B002N2SYAG|5.0|This show is so wonderful.  I do not know how more people do not watch it.  It is really a great show and great cast.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Anxiously awaited the 2nd of this trilogy.  Was not disappointed but not overly thrilled either.  Will read the 3rd book when it becomes available just to see how the families continue.  Certainly not in the same league as Pillars of the Earth or it's sequel World Without End.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|The cloud drive is simular to Apple fan's I-Cloud, but in my opinion better. I've always had a android & prefer to use one for my needs. The cloud drive is perfect for saving photos & such from my Galaxy S. 3. I'm very happy with the cloud drive app :).
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Easy reading that grabs you immediately.  Nice relaxing fun read and a good departure from more complicated novels.  Hope to see it as a movie some day..
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Saw this movie at a film group and decided to buy it rather than having to search for it to rent it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is pretty darn awesome. ive never had any problems with it. I really like this app. I have just one word Great!!!!!
0385737955|1.0|I never could put my finger on what it was, but this just didn't pique my interest, when everything about the description indicated that I would like this a lot. With all the rave reviews, I thought I'd be in for at least an okay read. I struggled just to finish it.
B009X00E18|3.0|Well, it is very light and thin, it adds no weight at all. The Kindle fits in snuggly and securily. It only allows the kindle to stand one landscape direction. It doesn't turn the kindle on and off as I read some cases do. It doesn't close over the cover, just sort of flaps over, but give enough coverage for carrying in purse or briefcase. If you're looking for protection from scratches and thin light weight, this is the case for you. If you want more versatility, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. It's a decent case.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a great piece of science fiction.  I was amazed to see how many 5 star reviews this book had, and I wondered if I would be able to join the crowd.  I'm happy to say that the book easily deserves that rating.  I'm glad that I didn't find out about Wool until the Omnibus edition came out.  Don't think I could have waited between installments!  The characters are believable and well drawn.  The plot is electrifying.  In a day when books often forgo chapters, Wool has nicely laid out chapters--often associated with changes of scene.  I was reading on the PaperWhite, so late at night when I saw that the next chapter was only 5-10 minutes of reading, I found myself saying \\"Just one more.\\"  Again and again and ....<br /><br />Thank you Hugh Howey for a great story.  Keep up the good work.  I'm on to First Shift!!
B00A7ZX4RO|5.0|From playful club bangers to moving ballads, Unapologetic is arguably Rihanna's best album (Loud would be the other).  I bought the album because I was impressed with the direction this album was going from the sound of Diamonds.  Even more interested when I heard Rih Rih perform Stay on SNL.  Stand out songs are What Now, Stay, Pour It Up and Half of Me (Definitely worth the deluxe).
030758836X|5.0|A smart thriller, one that's less about crime than about who we become in our relationships with our parents, siblings, and, most of all, our spouses. I'm still disturbed by the ending, which became almost gothic.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Beautiful voice, beautiful singing, and beautiful songs that somehow don't touch the beauty of her opening performance on 'Britain's Got Talent.'<br /><br />Now before you say that was because of her 'victory' if you must, of those naysayers, that's part of it sure, but what made here voice so endearing and commanding was the unrehearsed beauty of the timbre in her voice and the reflection of Susan's innocence in the emotion of her voice.<br /><br />Of course the temptation in a professionally produced CD such as this one is to create as many takes and do as much editing as needed to make Susan sound as perfect as possible, but then the music looses a lot of what made Susan such a great performer on 'Britain's Got Talent'. It looses a lot of Susan. Machines and technology can produce technically exact music and we've all heard it. It's not very rewarding. It's like hugging a car.<br /><br />Susan is a singer though that you know will perform well in concert unlike many celebrity singers.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is the best. I read other spy thrillers only to kill  time waiting for the next Vince Flynn book to be released..
0823015033|5.0|Very nice book I wish I could sew better.
0307887448|5.0|Though I was drawn in by the \\"child of the 80's\\" hook, I was surprised how this book grabbed me and took hold of me for two nights of non stop reading. Rarely do I get THIS drawn into a book - actually a WORLD, a virtual world of Oasis. I did grow up in the 80's but I didn't own a TRS 80, didn't play D and D and besides a bit of Pac Man and Space invaders, wasn't hooked on video games (although I could go head to head on 80's music with Wade and I do remember Space Invaders like it was yesterday). My point is that you don't have to be a video game geek to appreciate Cline's achievement here. The world he creates is stunning in it's detail. Sure, sometimes the interactions are a bit \\"cyber\\" (although that was part of his point - the two main characters \\"fall in love\\" in an email chat room and through their avatars) - I might not have dropped in that long dialogue  between then written as an email exchange, but in the context of the book I thought it worked rather well. Small quibbles aside, this turned out to be one of my favorite reads of the last year. I would love to peer inside of Cline's mind as he conceived of this book. Brilliant, innovative and an unbelievable page turner - I think I held my breath while he cleared the 256 boards of Pac Man. For a book totally out of my normal genre, this was one of the most gripping books of recent years. Once I finished, I turned to page 1 and reread the first 200 pages again - it's that good.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Free and yet still somehow on my list of to reads. I probably won't, as murder mysteries, even those that are always solved, aren't my cup of tea.
B009X012XM|4.0|I got a pair of these, in different colors, for the new HD, larger Kindle Fire's.  One kid got silver, the other orange and I think the bright color is certainly smarter than the silver (or black that I have on my original Kindle Fire).  As far as being a cover goes, it does snap on smartly and it is very easy to set it up as a viewing stand.  Otherwise, it does the job I want, which is protect it when it is sitting about.

B000ID37RM|5.0|People laugh because this is a black and white movie and story our children read about in middle school these days.  What they forget about is the power of the screenplay before music hit the pictures; the emotion that ran through each performer, scene and yes through us the viewer.  How you became engaged in the story to the point of being riveted on the edge of your seat for fear that you would be grabbed by the twisted neighbor...well let me tell you to leave your judgment at home and enjoy a stellar performance by Gregory Peck in one of the century's greatest classics!
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I bought this case a couple months ago. I was excited to see the price was much cheaper than the price at Best Buy or at the kiosks in the mall. When the case arrived and I put it on my phone the first time, I noticed this plastic that covered the screen was a little warped. Since it is not worth it to return anything purchased on Amazon (really, please fix your return policy), I have just delt with the warped screen issue. The warped screen allows an air pocket behind the plastic and it is very annoying when I'm typing. Also, when the camera on the iPhone 4S flashes, the pictures get a circular haze around the edges and are just terrible. So something in the design of this case needs to be fixed. Maybe I got what I paid for and this is not the real thing, just a cheap knock off. I will have to take some time to stop by Best Buy to see if their lifeproof case fits any better.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say is that my phone survived when my 4 year old dropped it on our hard wood floors.
B000ZHCQ5U|4.0|I had only seen bit's and pieces of this movie when I was a kid. So, when I saw it as a choice in the selections under Sci-fi movies, I thought I'd give it a shot.<br />I didn't recall Peter Sellers as playing three separate characters in this movie.<br />Stanley Kubricks genius shines through in this movie, even given the fact that the B52 scenes were a little hokie, although, from what I understand, he was not given permission to use actual footage of B52's by the U.S. Air Force at the time. Also, CGI was not available yet.<br />There's something to be said for B & W movies. I think it lends to the impactfulness of the times, during the height of the Cold War era. I would definitely recommend this movie.

0060531053|2.0|This is the first book I got for homebrewing and it has some good information to get you started.  However, it has a lot of not very good info/advice that is pretty out of date for such a recent book.  I'm not sure he's kept it up to date with new advances and equipment that's come to market.  In addition, I found the writing style to be gimmicky and repetitive.  I also found the pictures unhelpful.  I would recommend looking at other books such as \\"How to Brew\\" by John Palmer to get more accurate and up-to-date information.  Also, if you are lucky enough to have a local homebrew club, the easiest way to learn is to watch someone make a batch.

B009MO5E10|4.0|This movie uses the extreme bike messenger culture of New York as a backdrop for an action/adventure story. So it's mostly a 90-minute chase scene, with a few flashbacks & some plot elements thrown in there.<br /><br />The extreme bikers are similar to Parkour (PK / Free Running), where they don't stop for anything, do some stunts, etc. It's visually interesting. The plot is a bit of a cliche - Joseph Gordon-Levitt is carrying a package that could take down some dirty cops &/or the Chinese mafia, so he's being chased and hunted.<br /><br />My other complaint is that it didn't have more bike stunts - they missed some real opportunities here, nothing here was quite as exciting as the Parkour documentaries I've seen. Nonetheless, it did keep my interest. And I think one of the goals was realism, so this is definitely not \\"Transporter\\" or anything like that.<br /><br />I wasn't very aware of Joseph Gordon-Levitt until fairly recently (Inception, Batman, etc). He is hitting a really nice stride with his career, and in this movie he completely took on his character, 100% believable.<br /><br />The style & cinematography reminded me a bit of Danny Boyle's 172 hours (starring James Franco). Crisp and fresh.<br /><br />So even if the plot was a bit formulaic, I still give it a solid 4 stars because of great acting, eye-popping camera work, and a think-outside-the-box premise. I'm pretty sick of traditional Hollywood action movie, and it's so cool watching an \\"under the radar\\" flick like this provide as many thrills as a Blockbuster Bond movie. I'm really happy to see something fresh, even if it's not perfect.

B001GUXJQA|4.0|Michael Connolly's intrepid detective, Hieronymus Bosch, (Harry) seems on the brink of extinction from the LAPD in every volume. His feuds with the top brass are legendary. No matter if he's wounded or on desk duty or threatened, he cannot resist a case.<br /><br />So it is with \\"Black Ice.\\" Harry is handed a manila folder marked \\"Give to Harry Bosch.\\" So somebody knows something. The problem is that somebody is either dead by suicide or one of the murder victims that has turned up near a local diner.<br /><br />The plot includes two possible love interests for Harry, a fascinating trip to Calexico and Mexicali, and some very bad bad guys. Harry plans ahead, but when things start popping, he goes with his gut, a tendency that creates fear and suspense for the reader.<br /><br />Michael Connolly has created a lovable and fallible hero. I am always waiting for the next mystery and appearance of Harry.<br /><br />Four stars to this one for some stilted dialog. Was there a ghostwriter or rushed editing? I still loved the book.

B005FVFWOI|4.0|To many listeners, \\"Aqualung\\" may be the best, or even the \\"only\\" Jethro Tull recording.  While I may not feel quite so strongly about it, I like this album, and have respect for it creatively and musically.  I was disappointed in previous CD versions of it, and having read a range of reviews for this remastered 2011 release, both positive and negative, I decided I should hear it for myself.<br /><br />Something significant was discovered listening to the first few seconds of the album:  the famous six-note guitar line that opens the title track is heard twice.  This is in fact the correct, original introduction, with the drums entering only after the guitar has repeated the opening figure.  Playing an early vinyl LP of \\"Aqualung\\" I owned years ago had been the last time, until this CD, that I had heard it presented this way.  Later LP pressings and subsequent releases in several configurations dropped the first guitar line.  This confounded me for years just as, I can well imagine, hearing this restoration may baffle anyone who has never before heard the introduction in its original form.<br /><br />Musically, \\"Aqualung\\" is quite impressive, and great credit is due to all members of Jethro Tull, who do a skillful turn realizing Ian Anderson's eclectic, complex music.  Guitarist Martin Barre, who joined the band on \\"Stand Up\\", their second album, struggled a bit on that one, but by the next album (\\"Benefit\\") the refinement of his playing had taken a giant stride.  Next came \\"Aqualung\\", and his performance here, rightly, won him quite a bit of acclaim.  I might also give a special nod to keyboardist John Evan, who first worked with Tull on \\"Benefit\\".  A classically-trained performer, his playing seems specially suited to some of the more baroque moments in this music.<br /><br />Some reviewers give this CD a low rating on the basis of its sound.  I do not take issue with them, as we all hear things in an individual way.  However, I think the sound is about as good ascan be expected, given several factors.  For one thing, CDs just simply have limitations.  Listeners comparing any CD with a vintage vinyl LP of the same music are likely to be disappointed with the former.  In addition, I have heard (not to be quoted here) that the master tape of \\"Aqualung\\" has been lost.  If this is true, there is no telling what was used as a source recording for this current disc.  The 1996, 25th Anniversary release was mastered using special noise reduction technology, raising questions about the source tape then as well.  On this new one, I can detect that attention was given to capturing the dynamic range and, as much as may be possible, the ambient qualities of the original recording.  So, if this one is not perfect, it sounds better to me than earlier CD versions (I should mention that I have not heard the DCC gold disc), and is a worthy effort.<br /><br />The second disc in the set contains some tracks which have been released previously, and a few that have not, all mastered with the same care as the featured album.  It is very nice to have 'Wond'ring Again' included, this time appearing as a kind of extended coda built onto 'Wond'ring Aloud', its companion track from \\"Aqualung\\".  This conjoined version has evidently not been released before, making it seem a worthwhile addition and not just a gimmick.<br /><br />My rating of four stars can be read as four-and-a-half.  I think it is about as good as anything we will see on compact disc.  If this music on CD sounded more like the vinyl record did (which may not be possible), and if a few details such as the inclusion of printed lyrics had been seen to, this would easily rate five stars.

B009X00E18|4.0|I received this case from the Amazon Vine program right after I already purchased the case that Amazon sells for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" model. They both have their advantages and disadvantages. This one is very light. The rubberized case seems like it will make for a good, protective case. I had a very similar Marware case on my original Kindle Fire, and I never had any issues with it. This one seems very similarly made, and I expect it will last just as long and well. This doesn't have the auto-wake and auto-sleep feature that the much more expensive Amazon case has, but it also sets up a little easier in its stand, in my opinion. The biggest problem I have with the Amazon model is that my \\"L\\"-shaped headphone jack will not fit through the case. That is not a problem on this model as the headphone plug is wide open. Overall, this is a pretty good case for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\".

B00007LTIC|5.0|\\"Going for the One\\" was a brilliant return to form for Yes, and a necessary one, too -- without this 1977 album and the new pathway it provided for the band to move forward, I think it's entirely possible Yes would have broken up.<br /><br />Yes had had some amazing successes at the time this album was recorded. \\"The Yes Album,\\" \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Close to the Edge\\" were, each and every one, monumental art rock classics. From the tough-minded riffing of \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" on \\"The Yes Album\\" to the FM hit \\"Roundabout\\" on \\"Fragile\\" to the lyrical \\"And You and I\\" from \\"Close to the Edge,\\" the songs were sure, powerful and graceful.<br /><br />And then, at the height of its powers, Yes seemed to lose its way. \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans,\\" a 2-LP issue back in those vinyl days, drove keyboardist Rick Wakeman from the band; he quit after its release, flummoxed by the approach: Four sidelong suites of music, inspired by the Indian shastric scriptures, that just didn't seem to hold together the way the title track for \\"Close to the Edge\\" had. \\"Relayer,\\" the followup from 1974, featured Patrick Moraz filling in for the departed Wakeman, and consisted of a single LP featuring two tracks on side two (\\"Sound Chaser,\\" \\"To Be Over\\") and side one's sidelong \\"The Gates of Delirium.\\" The album was even more of a mess than \\"Topographic\\" was, with Yes descending so far into dissonance on some tracks (\\"Sound Chaser\\" especially) that even some of the group's hardcore fans found it difficult to follow.<br /><br />Note: To be fair, I should acknowledge that \\"Topographic\\" and \\"Relayer\\" have gained some stature over the years. I myself listen to them infrequently, and do enjoy sections of both albums, especially \\"Topographic's\\" concluding piece, \\"Ritual (Nous Sommes Du Soleil).\\"<br /><br />Yes, itself, seemed to sense this loss of direction; \\"Relayer\\" was released in 1974 and it would be three years before \\"Going For the One\\" saw daylight in 1977. Part of that time was taken up, of course, by each of the five band members releasing solo albums in 1975.<br /><br />When \\"Going for the One\\" did arrive in stores, fans and even critics of Yes were pleased. The album opened with the title track, which packed a lot of gritty rock 'n' roll into just five and a half minutes, thanks in no small measure to Steve Howe's snarling guitars. \\"Turn of the Century\\" was a beautiful piece of lyric writing from vocalist Jon Anderson, supported by musical input from Howe and drummer Alan White. Side one concluded with \\"Parallels,\\" an amazing track by bassist Chris Squire that featured Wakeman's excellent performance on the pipe organ at St. Martins Church in Vevey, Switzerland.<br /><br />None of the three songs on side one exceeded eight minutes in length. Side two began with one that clocked in at just under four, Anderson's beautiful (and radio friendly!) \\"Wonderous Stories.\\"<br /><br />Yes did revert to the long-song format for the album's final song. But while much of \\"Relayer\\" especially seemed like indulgent noodling, \\"Awaken\\" clearly was a piece that had been thought out thoroughly by its composers, Anderson and Howe. Its 15:31 running time began with a nimble piano figure from Wakeman, followed by a vocal introduction from Anderson that led into the song's main groove. The interlude featured more of Wakeman's playing on the St. Martins pipe organ, this time showing him in a reflective mood as opposed to his aggressive work on \\"Parallels.\\"<br /><br />Over the years, \\"Going For the One\\" has become one of my \\"go-to\\" Yes albums. It's great to put it on and experience, once again, the combination that worked when this band was at its peak: A mix of power, grace and confidence. I highly recommend it.e, by each of the five band members releasing solo albums in 1975.<br /><br />When \\"Going for the One\\" did arrive in stores, fans and even critics of Yes were pleased.

B009WUBERW|2.0|Just as you'd expect, you'll see bit parts from a range of great actors. The catch? There's little to no direction, the plot is absurdly simply, no character development (at least there was a little in the first), and horrible, non-stop one-liners from films iconic to each actor, respectively. If you are able to remove all thought-process while watching this film, then you'll probably enjoy the limited action it provides. Otherwise, this isn't worth the money or time -- there are plenty of great releases that overshadow this, even amongst the genre of \\"mind-numbing action\\".

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was heavily recommended to me shortly after I discovered the internet phenomena known as &#34;Vlogbrothers&#34; (and their offshoot channels) (far too late, I might add). &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; is John Green at his finest. I can say truly that I have not cried as hard or as long reading any other book in recent history; however, that is not to say that this is a sad book (it is). Green's lightning wit and never-ending plethora of clever dialogue, along with wonderfully sculpted characters, give this book something above and beyond- a thing greater than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />I can write congratulatory nonsense in this review all day, but that does not change the fact that &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; should be read. By you. Buy it. The Kindle version is lovely.
0441020712|3.0|This book was just too loose, meandering, and long--it needed to be edited down to perhaps a hundred pages less.  Moreover, to me, it was more a bunch of not very well-connected vignettes rather than a solid whole, and very often just an Ooh and Ahh travelogue of the wonders of the 23rd century (in imitation, perhaps, of the novel \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" that played such an important part in this novel).<br /><br />In addition, I found the state of the world described in this book to be just one long leftist wish fulfillment--Global Warming real and having apparently reduced the \\"evil\\" old West to impotence and irrelevance, Africa surviving the disastrous effects of Global Warming,  getting its recompense for all the \\"evil\\" that the West had done to it by becoming the world's leading economic and technological power, humans becoming \\"more\\" through technological add-ons, modifications, and improvements, genetic manipulation to produce a new race of aquatic \\"merpeople,\\" war, crime, and violence largely eliminated thanks to a virtually  all encompassing surveillance state, universal screening for \\"violent\\" traits, brain implants, and an ever watchful  machine intelligence in control--i.e. a  leftist, totalitarian Utopia dominated by the MACHINE, which wouldn't mind and could incapacitate, jail, or even kill humans to \\"stop\\" violence.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />I also found the great mystery that all the clues were leading to was just too far-fetched--the shattered pieces of a plaque only the hero's wily, dynamic, secretive, iconoclastic, world-class explorer and businesswoman grandmother was smart enough to recognize as significant, that was likely scribbled on, untold millions of years ago, by some bored alien, for some reason whiling away time on Mar's moon Phobos, whose scribblings described an extremely powerful and entirely new Physics, light years more advanced than that of the 23rd century (isn't that the kind of game-changing, Rosetta stone level graffiti that we all write on public buildings and monuments and on tourist attractions?), and the key to an entirely new, higher order of energy and, therefore,  a higher order civilization, and to extra-solar space flight or, if handled badly, to the destruction of the human race and our solar system.
B0016JBCJW|5.0|Starts out kind of slow, but its how Wes draws you in.  Like other Wes Anderson movies, you end up thinking about a lot of the events later and you have to watch it again.

Darjeeling delivers in the same fashion many of Wes Anderson movies do, its serious funny, a little twisted, a little dark, character struggles, and a fantastic movie.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|This was gotten for my granddaughter to play on my Kindle.  She loves and enjoys it very much.  Unsure If I will use myself but well worth it for her.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Fun family movie the whole familia can enjoy;  good guys bad guys and aw moments.  Great laughs, picture colors really fun
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun and challenging. the only problem i have it it seem to take alot of point to unlock games
B000CEAGH6|5.0|My first and foremost criteria in buying dinosaurs for my toddler was that it have very little odor. I have purchased the tub of animals from Toys-R-Us in the past, and was just about knocked over by the plastic stench emanating from it. I thought that if I spent more money, that it would cease to be an issue. My hunch held true. Not being a dinophile, I cannot attest to the anatomical correctness of these figures, but they have a nice heft and paint job.
B008133MDK|5.0|this Sherlock is original and modern. He's edgy with a conceited persona that you actually like. the fast action keeps you wanting more and it's not predictable.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Yes I would recomend this to anyone. Its a great season yet. Also its afordable and you get to choose the episodes you want to purchase. Thanks Amazon.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|Great movie;Birdwatchers will love this movie as much as wine lovers loved &#34;Sideways&#34;.I especially enjoyed the scenery and the story was very entertaining. The movie is about dedicated&#34; birders&#34; who attempt to break the record of 732 of birds spotted in a year. It is also about defending the record by the current champion Kenny Bostick(Owen Wilson).Steve Martin and Jack Black are the main competetiors for the title.You've got to watch this movie to find out who wins overall and enjoy a heartwarming tale.Anyone will relish&#34;The Big Year&#34; as a humorous story regardless of their affection for our feathered friends.
0385535147|5.0|I love John Grisham books anyway but this one is one of the best. Great storyline with twists and turns and just when you are adjusted to the pace of the story, it shifts on you. Don't miss this one.
B00005JM20|1.0|This was listed as used but very good condition.  Unfortunately, about 30 minutes into the movie it became unwatchable as the disc was clearly damaged.  Amazon were excellent in their customer service refunding me the cost of the movie and giving me a shipping label, but it cost me almost the price of the movie to buy a new padded envelope to return it even though postage was paid (I hadn't kept the packaging it came in - too trusting I guess!)
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I love the sound that this group has.  To me it seems everyone enjoys listening no matter what their taste in music.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was truly amazing it was so different from the movie and I loved the strong detail. It was a beautiful story and I suggest it to everyone in every age.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Very good series.  Much better and more imaginative then the 50 shades of gray series. A third book would be nice
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Let it grow! Let it grow! I love the music in this movie almost as much as my kids. Great film. We've watched several times. Love the lesson in respecting and caring for our environment.
B008CLI3TE|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the books, so when I found out HBO was adapting Game of Thrones into a series, I was thrilled. It stays very loyal to the source material, and it is visually splendid. Yes, it's graphic, but also realistic. I think people who haven't read the novels would still be able to enjoy the series, but they may find themselves confused at times, as there are many characters and story lines. Can't wait for season 2 to come out on Blu-ray!
B009T1J0PM|5.0|Diary of a simply kid is an awesome book it is so funny and ot os so good I could not stop reading it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Funny, entertaining and sad in a glorious way. Raw and forces you to toil with your own mortality, while making you feel infinitely grateful for life and its resplendant imperfections.
B003Z71OO6|4.0|Denzel Washington stars in this inspiring story of the development of an award winning debating team at a small black college, based on an article published in American Legacy magazine in 1997.  The movie is set in Texas in the 1930's, a time of severe economic disruptions and racial discrimination. In spite of all the adversities faced by the student debaters and their debate coach, they persevere and achieve amazing success in debates with black as well as white colleges. Some of the debates are depicted in the movie, and the points made by each side are quite interesting. Overall, a very fine movie that holds your interest throughout.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a very good app I highly recommend this if u love all kinds if different games from arcade classics to new graphical games again a must have in my book

B003QCCS36|5.0|at times dark and brooding but  plenty of places for the light of hope to shine.full of honesty and real attitude.stellar musicianship sets a perfect dynamic backdrop for lamontagnes lyrics and emotional delivery.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|graphics are cute and fun. hardly any learning curve... if you've played the farmville type games you are good to go. very fun and entertaining and you don't have to spend a cent. would recommend easy enough and fun for kids and fun little game to pass the time for adults too.  plays like a dream on my kindle fire.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|in this era of over -produced,pitch corrected,childishly written drivel performed by talentless tarts and &#34;ken-doll&#34; faces ,ray lamontagne and his band of old school musicians continue to remind us that real music comes from the soul.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this game is so fun. and VERY addicting, I just could not stop playing ever since I got it. spool fun!!!!!!!!!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Ever since I started watching the YouTube videos from The Piano Guys, I have been totally amazed by the music and the arrangements. I myself was a violin player in my church choir and there is something about Violin music that makes me stop everything I do and just listen to it. And this collection is an awesome combination of the most beautiful stringed instruments - the violin and the cello. And with the Piano accompaniment, the CD is worth every penny you pay for. It has been close to a month since I got the CD and it has been playing on an endless loop in my CAR. I enjoy the music during the drive. And I am awaiting another release from The Piano Guys. I know there are more albums that they have and I am waiting for them to come out with another CD.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|This is a great film, it makes you want to watch the others. This is a great film that makes you respect what love can do
B006LSZECO|4.0|I'm going to keep this short, I loved the story and hated the ending. It was so sudden (I read the digital copy so I couldn't really tell how close it was to ending). I felt (feel - just finished it a few days ago) that the author could have done a little more to finish it up. If there is no sequel I will be very disappointed because I would love to know how the story actually ends!
B007FEZQF8|4.0|Nice start to a series that isn't your typical comic book fare. I am a huge fan of the TV show and wanted to compare the two mediums. Many similarities, but there are definitely enough differences to make it worthwhile to try both.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This is an fun &amp; enjoyable game, and I loved playing it . . . until it reset my scores TWICE, causing me to lose all of the progress I've made. So frustrating.
B007EE564U|5.0|Typical Vince Flynn - and I loved it. Mitch Rapp is one of my favourite characters and does not disappoint in this latest book.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Enjoyed the book.  Was a harsh look inside the mind of a very troubled youngster and the conflcts faced by his mother.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app is a great tool when in the dark! I got it because I tripped and almost broke my screen so I got Flashlight HD LED!!
0547884591|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK! Seriously, there is so much useful information in here about hacking the learning process that the first few chapters make the whole book worth the price of admission. That being said alot of reviewers have complained about the seemingly sporadic organization of the chapters but this is a book about learning and not necessarily about cooking or survival skills or THE TURBACON! (but if it was JUST about the Turbacon, I think I would still buy it ). Each chapter builds on this idea and uses various techniques to enforce the meta-learning idea. I highly recommend this book! Tim Ferris will change your life.<br /><br />Seriously though, if you like meat, google \\"Turbacon\\" and then buy the book :)
1878424319|2.0|This book came highly recommended but honestly I didn't think it went very deep at all. Basically everything you need to know is listed on the back cover. Each &#34;agreement&#34; is rather obvious so they don't require such lengthy descriptions. Sure it's a good reminder of certain stuff but this book did not change my life/mindset.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|good follow up to book #1. It's pretty similar to Shades of Grey. I enjoy this type of reading...light, fun and stress free.
0810989956|2.0|My daughter loves this book and really enjoyed the activities and interaction that the book invites, that being said, I was really unhappy about the rudeness that was a re occurring theme in the book. How can we teach our kids that bullying and rude behavior is unacceptable, when it is portrayed as funny in the book. There were many positive things in the book but due to this issue I won't be buying any more editions.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was fabulous! It was very hard to get into! I started it once...and didn't finish it. A few months later, I tried it again and I'm so glad I did! It gets better with each chapter! I highly reccommend it to anyone who likes twists and drama!
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Basic camera app for the Kindle HD.  It does the job and allows you to take a picture and save or even e-mail it to someone.  That's just about it.  Short on options or even basic documentation.  I wish it had more on screen design options to select what you were taking a picture of so you could crop your picture area first.  I am sure that future versions of this APP or others will improve over the next few months but as of not this is it if you want to take pictures with your Kindle.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great, was having trouble charging my fire until I got this charger.  It is nice that it has the USB cable.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is one of the must have apps for your Kindle.  Listen to all kinds of radio stations and more options than the other combined.  I use it daily.
B008VBYN80|4.0|its an alright game. I like it I guess. Not really a lot to it yet.  not sure if I'm going to keep playing though.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is seriously the craziest stuff that I never would have thought would be allowed on television haha! Its so wrong.... but I'm so hooked!
B004L0NGEC|4.0|app works great for accessing my picasa albums.  super easy to download individual photos to my kindle fire. well worth the $.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I became hooked on Solitaire in the 90s.  After retiring in 2010, I lost touch.  But I have it with me all of the time now.  This version works beautifully,  especially on waiting rooms.  It's great.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is one of the best adventure/self-discovery books that I have read.  Strayed is funny, fun, scared, adventurous, and a little hippy-crazy.  A definite great read and even one to read again later.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Nelson DeMille writes a fast-paced, memorable read as he introduces his audience to his most-repeated character, John Corey. A smart, tough, intelligent smart-ass from the NYPD Homocide Squad convalesces on Long Island who becomes enmeshed in the  invetigation of the double-murder of two of his newest local friends, a married couple who may have discovered Captain Kidd's hidden treasure on \\"Plum Island\\" - a wonderful novel!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Probably the best comedy currently on tv.  Excellent acting with new situations every week. Adding Amy to the mix is fantastic.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If you love these movies and lets be honest, who doesn't? This is THE set to get, great extras, clean picture.
B001Q1QF2O|5.0|A friend got me listening to the first record. I love all kinds of music, but don't buy a lot (mostly because I listen to Audiobooks constantly so there is no room for additional listening time) however, Lily Allen is my new favorite. Reminds me of: sex in the city, meets HBO's shameless character Fiona Gallagher that is packaged into an upfront youthful British pop star..Lily's songs are fun stories with upbeat rhythms that make you want to get moving and enjoy the music. Her songs are both funny (like girl friend humor funny) and also kind of relatable! I love her accent and wish she made more songs b/c I have them all and that is not enough. As far as the 'explicit warning'...I dunno about that. Not hard core..maybe some songs you don't want to play cranked up at work but that is not the entire album. Anyway, if you are looking for a funny, chicklet, mood boost get this.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is, hands down, the best show on tv (according to me)! I read the comics and though its a but different it holds tight.
B001PBEJL4|5.0|Love the movie, love the music, love the story.  I'm glad it was issued in Blu-ray, so I can see it again in all it's glory.
B001FB5634|5.0|This is a great movie. No idea why it wasnt a huge hit. Notice the thumbs... very interesting. Love the movie.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|It is pretty good.<br />Everybody loves it. Fast, some skills required :-)<br />You can play it over and over<br />Thx
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is too addictive, My daughter put in on my Kindle and she won't let me have it back any more.
B000000ZGN|5.0|Being someone who rarely listens to songs over 6 minutes i decided to take a gamble and purchase this LP. That said i could not believe my ears, the 30 second samples give these tracks little justice, just as it seemed i had placed the needle on the record i found myself having to start over, though long they seem on paper, in reality the tracks are so good by the time you realize it you have to replay them again and again making the album not long enough,i must have replayed side 1 four times! though one thing i must admit the intro to \\"by the time i get to pheonix\\" would have been better in a LIVE recording and not a studio one, but i dont mind, having the vinyl version allows me to set the needle ahead of the intro (but i wont)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book! I had no interest until I watched the movie but I'm glad I did! It gave me more insight to what happened! Going to read the 2nd one now
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My favorite song on this album is Begin Again!  All the songs are good though! I listen to it all the time.
B005LAJ212|5.0|It's adult viewing and detailed.  You have to keep paying attention as it is full of action and moves quickly.  Certainly not a boring series.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This free app game is colorful, easy to learn, and enjoyable for any age. Fans of the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic television show will appreciate the appearance of many familiar characters.<br /> The clean humor and warm atmosphere, coupled with countless minigames and a boundless opportunity for customization offer unending amusement. With the added element of social gameplay which rewards users for cooperation and you have a truly remarkable game.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|A lot of detail in this.  A lot for thought, too.  Could we as a country come to this same type of reality.
B005CWRB44|2.0|You have to twist the light to turn it off and on and to switch modes.  Forget about using this in any kind of panic situation in the dark. It is bright and otherwise a nice light.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|Disney Classic!! Disney Classic enough said!!  Just adding to my video collection for my entire family to enjoy.  These are hard to find cartoons!
B0045XICB2|3.0|As a crucial part of the Twilight saga, Eclipse is a necessary addition to the film series.  However, I think most viewers will find it a bit slow and plodding compared to the emotionally charged Twilight and the action-packed Twilight: New Moon.  Eclipse spends more time on character histories and internal character development than the other stories in the series, which means that except for the final fight scene, it lacks excitement.  I didn't mind watching it--the story is still compelling--but it's not my favorite of the five movies in the series.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Disney Classic enough said!!  Just adding to my video collection for my entire family to enjoy.  These are hard to find cartoons!
B0088X7YMS|4.0|Don't get me wrong. This is not a great movie. The plot seems a tad too simple, it lacks the social satire of the original, and there are parts that are either boring or where it is hard to care about some of the characters, but there are a number of really big positives in this movie. One, it's WAY better than Starship Troopers 2 or 3 (not much of a compliment, but it is worth mentioning). Two, the CGI animation is gorgeous, and presents a very pretty spectacle to watch. Three, a couple of the characters are actually given enough character to care about them, and personal investment in a Starship Troopers movie is nothing to sneer at. It's not great, but it is a lot better than I was expecting. I know fans of the first Starship Troopers have had their faith all but destroyed by the previous two films, but I think this is worth checking out.
B0084IHVGG|5.0|Disney Classic!!Disney Classic enough said!!  Just adding to my video collection for my entire family to enjoy.  These are hard to find cartoons!
B0020PJJHS|5.0|It is honestly surprising to me that, considering how great this movie was and how great Pierce Brosnan was as the title character in it, how terribly the rest of his career as Bond. Goldeneye is a great movie, playing on the ideas that Bond and the OO unit have to evolve in the aftermath of the Cold War even as ghosts of the fallen USSR threaten to destroy Britain with deadly secret Russian technology. Brosnan sells you on him being Bond, both in the suave traits and in some of the cold, calculating ruthlessness that showed up in the darker Bond movies. All of the villains, particularly Famke Janssen as Ms. Onatopp (ahh sex puns), are memorable and fun to watch. The plot is a lot of fun, and it ties in closely to Bond with how it plays out (no spoilers for the people under rocks who haven't seen Goldeneye). This is easily one of my top 5 favorite Bond movies, and thus it makes me sad to know that the Brosnan era will also give me the worst Bond movie ever made (rot in hell Die Another Day). This movie should be bought and watched by any fan of James Bond. Truly a fun movie.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Disney Classic enough said!!  Just adding to my video collection for my entire family to enjoy.  These are hard to find cartoons!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was worried about the series being too dark and too much of a glimpse into what the future could hold. On the contrary, it was just a great, engaging story. Highly recommend, even for people with reservations.
B009AZZEU2|3.0|Chris Cornell has been writing incredible songs for more than two decades. It's no surprise that this album is his least memorable. Soundgarden's best songs were dark, original, and highly listenable. The band's earlier incorporation of acoustic guitar made the songs accessible to the masses. King Animal loses this likability. While there are enough songs to make this album worthwhile, none will be stuck in your head more than a few weeks from now. Sorry, Soundgarden, but this album does disappoint.<br /><br />I saw Cornell play a live acoustic show in LA about a year ago and his voice sounded exquisite. For some reason, it sounds like he aged significantly more than \\"A Thousand Days\\" for this effort.
B004YM6JLO|3.0|Let me count the ways -- or, on second thought, maybe not.  My Google search for \\"vampires in movies and books\\" yielded 15 million entries.  Suffice it to say that these creatures are lodged deeply in our collective unconscious.  The \\"Twilight\\" movies alone have so far grossed an astonishing 3 billion dollars worldwide.  Television's Vampire Diaries has gone on to Season 4, and True Blood to Season 6.  What can account for the extraordinary appeal that these stories seem to have for countless hordes of teenage girls?  I am not part of that demographic, but will nonetheless try to evaluate these three shows.  If I should by chance tread on your favorite, please don't take offense.<br /><br />Vampire Diaries has many flaws, but none of them are quite fatal.  The most glaring of these flaws is this:  The producers seem to have scoured Hollywood to find every available pretty boy with six-pack abs (a specialty of this network), but, alas, most of them are at best unconvincing actors.  The good news, however, is this show's endearing fidelity to the basic High School Vampire mythology.  Also, these scripts are much better written than the clunky twaddle that passes for dialogue in the Twilight films.  Of course, as all true genre fans know, the boy vampire will try heroically to deny his evil nature in order to win his girl's love.  This struggle never ends, but will always be continued next week, and always include a touching final scene accompanied by a sweet pop song.  I may sound a bit cynical here, but, in fact, these moments usually bring a tear to my eye.<br /><br />Possibly the most surprising and curious thing about this show may be its bizarre chastity.  Having hired all those comely actors, the producers never let us see them naked, even when having sex.  This is in contrast to True Blood, which tends to take nudity and sex to campy excess.  So what is it about Vampire Diaries that makes it work?  Here's one suggestion:  The photography and direction are veryfine and every shot is beautifully illuminated against dark shadows like a Vermeer painting.  (True Blood, by contrast, tends to look quite gaudy).  This subtlety of design and lighting suits these ancient creatures.<br /><br />Finally, there is actor Ian Sommerhalder, who plays the bad brother Damon (or is he the good brother?).  While his mugging, smirking, and waggling eyebrows should certainly be dialed back a bit, he completely steals every scene he is in.  Perhaps he is the series' secret weapon.<br /><br /> In sum, then, the classic simplicity of Vampire Diaries easily beats the overwrought extravagance of True Blood and the lame dialogue of the Twilight series, and earns my vote as the best of the genre.  I will be back for the next season.
B008G12ERC|1.0|Guys! What Happened?!! Muse's first 4 albums were filled with groundbreaking, high-energy songs that are still great to listen to today. I would suggest that Muse is one of the top 5 bands of the 2000s. But, man! What a terrible start to the new decade!<br /><br />Get away from the synthesizers! All you need is 1 guitar, 1 base, 1 drum kit and a singer who hasn't run out of cool stuff to sing about, eg. the Absolution days. I'm desperately hoping for a new rock revival, and Muse is the band to take us there! Quit trading in your musical freedom and originality for commercial success. Muse hasn't matured, they've sold out!
B000TEUSJK|5.0|It has a great story line, with a plot and theme.  It will hold your interest, but, it is a long movie.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|This is a fantastic album all the way through. While Diamond Eyes is slightly more interesting and a touch harder, Koi No Yokan is beautifully crafted and extremely listenable. Deftones is the most consistently excellent rock band still producing music. Keep it up!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I haven't got game yet because I want to know if there is wiring. so... is there? :D I need to fill word minimum.
B004TUKNX6|5.0|I re-discovered Rush recently and this album is fantastic.  Of course, everyone loves Tom Sawyer, but the CD is solid all the way through.  Very few bands can claim this same talent and creativity.
B004SEUJ64|5.0|I love the X-men movies,can they be impoved, you bet-blue ray,wow everything looks better. I just traded up on my X-men movies to blue- ray. I am glad I did. The first three. I bought, the fouth one straight out on blue-ray. The last one X-class kind of disapointed me, but that's another review.  For favorite movies stick with blue-ray.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|I love &#34;Hold On,&#34; but I found that listening to the album all the way through lends itself to monotony.  This is a very solid band overall, though.  Love the lead singer.
B008PWUYVA|3.0|I really wanted to love this cover.  It looks great, and I like the grippy technology they used.  My Kindle Fire fits perfectly with easy access to buttons/speakers, etc.<br /><br />That is the good.  The slightly less than stellar is the fact that there is not as much protection as a cover that has a full spine which I feel protects the corners better than this.  That said, I did NOT intentionally try dropping my Kindle to SEE if the corners and edges would survive.  I also don't like the velcro closure.  I had a very unhappy spouse who HAD been sleeping the other night when I decided to read a book in bed when..... you guessed it... in a quiet room, the velcro closure makes a very loud noise!<br /><br />In all, it is a neat looking case that does hold the Kindle Fire well and has neat grippy technology for standing it up on just about any surface.  I'm just not 100% comfortable letting the kids use my Kindle while in this case because I don't want to put it's protection to the test.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't put it down.  The character development is in depth and the book has moments that made me laugh and kept me on the edge of my seat.
B00A0A6F7C|3.0|I have loved Susan Boyle's voice ever since she opened her mouth on the Britain's Got Talent stage.  I was excited to buy this album of her work with some of my favorite songs from the Broadway stage.  Several songs were a disappointment because the verse was often drowned out by the Big Production Orchestra.  Not so much on the forceful parts of the Chorus, but every time she dropped the volume, there it was again, the accompaniment made it difficult to really hear the subtle tones of those phrases. That seems to me to be the mixer's fault, not Ms. Boyle's, but it did keep me from fully enjoying this album.<br /><br />I also want to say about this thread, some don't seem to understand that a review is not a comparison of this album to another.  Comments should be kept to the album being considered.  I agree, I think the other singers would be appalled to see their fans using the thread to ignore Susan Boyle and hawk their albums like used car salesmen.[[ASIN:B009G7ZYPY Standing Ovation: The Greatest Songs From The Stage]]
B005HSG3U6|5.0|A nice, good quality case. Fits very well and the stand up feature is nice too. Have yet to test if it will prevent the kindle from breaking but I imagine it will do the job.
0140282033|5.0|On a whim, Vianne Rocher and her 5 year old daughter move into a tiny town in France that is basically run by Reynaud, the cure`, a stern man who shepherds the villagers through their every move. With their brightly colored clothing and  outgoing ways, Vianne and Anouk  stand out like macaws in a flock of crows. Both Vianne and Reynaud have deep secrets and Vianne earns Reynaud's enmity almost at once by opening a chocolate shop- which would be bad enough in his view, but to add insult to injury, she does it at the beginning of Lent, when Reynaud wants all to deny themselves any kind of pleasure. At first he feels she will fail quickly, but she has a touch not just with candy making but with people- she has the ability to know what people want or need. When she announces plans for a chocolate festival to be held on Easter Sunday, it's war.<br /><br /> This is a work of magical realism, but one where the magic is denied. We're never entirely sure it's real... but despite the denial, there are some pretty strong signs it is. It's also a book about jealousy, prejudice, the value of being true to one's self, aging with &eacute;lan, love, loss, abuse, bullying and a lot of other things that make up life no matter where. Told in the alternating, first person POVs of Vianne and Reynaud, the book opens their pasts enough to us so we know why they act as they do, but leaves enough unsaid to keep us wanting more. The descriptive prose is glittering: the chocolates, the wrappings, the foods, the wine and champagne all appear in three dimensions and five senses. Don't read this book if you are dieting; it provokes cravings that, in my case at least, will not be denied. A beautiful book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can‘t just read one part of a series and call it good. I'm glad its over. Slightly confusing but I couldn't put it down.:)

I wasn't quite sure what I was getting myself into at the beginning, but I quickly found myself laughing, groaning, and crying. Well-written, well cast, and well shot. Exactly what I needed.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a great time killer! Does take any thought. My 6 year old is always playing it in the car.
0671027344|2.0|I was kind of expecting to like this book, because everyone else I know who's read it has described it with words like \\"amazing\\" and \\"powerful\\" and told me how important it was to them and how much they related to it.  So I tried.  I really did.  Even when the main character burst into tears 15 times in 10 pages, sobbing anytime someone was nice to him.  I tried to put myself in his 15-year-old shoes, but it still left a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />I knew this book and I were not going to like each other about the time I got to that dreadful poem.  If you think that is good poetry, then I am going to gently suggest you make a trip to a library or book store and visit the poetry section.  As a lover of poetry (both classical and contemporary), I have to say that the poem in this book is not even bad in a way I can make fun of.  It's just trite and useless.  I am assuming that the author of the book wrote it, because no serious poet could get that published outside of the context of a young adult novel.  I hope.  Please, god, don't let poetry sink that far into self-indulgent tripe.<br /><br />It just tried SO HARD.  Around every corner was suicide, rape, abortion, drinking, drug use, bullying, violence, sex, depression, child abuse, family problems and low self-esteem.  I'm not disputing that those are all serious, important issues and worthy material for a novel.  I AM disputing that I have to like a book just because the author brought that stuff up.  It felt...cheap.  Like a big shortcut that he thought should automatically lead to substance.  In real life?  Yeah, that's substance.  On paper?  Nope. Not unless you deal with it in any sort of realistic or meaningful way (or at least humanize it, for god's sake).<br /><br />I was talking to my brother about it, and I exclaimed, \\"But he's not even interesting!  He's just an empty shell of a human being, and not in a fun way!\\"<br /><br />And here's the thing: I was DEFINITELY sort of a weird kid, an outsider among the various high school cliques, a shy girl who cried too much about silly things.  And I definitely struggled with depression, low self-esteem, not feeling like I was really a part of things.  So I kept feeling like I ought to be more sympathetic, but I couldn't be.  I just kept thinking, \\"how can anyone be this inexcusably BORING?\\"<br /><br />But maybe that's not what gets me.  If someone in real life were that boring, it would be different.  It's more affronting to me that I am expected to want to READ about this kid's bland-ass, clichéd life observations.  Even when he's dropping acid at parties, getting into fistfights and screwing around with a girl he doesn't even like, he STILL manages to make it dull--mostly by crying through all of it.  And not even describing HOW he cried; he usually just says, \\"then I started crying.\\"<br /><br />In all fairness, there were parts of this book that I did like.  Namely, any parts that were about Charlie's friends, rather than Charlie himself.  If I'd hated every page, I wouldn't have finished reading it (or maybe I would have--I'm contrary like that).  But that made me feel even worse, after I'd finished it.  I WANTED to like it.  I could ALMOST like it.  But not quite.  It was like being in a relationship with someone who's wretchedly, terribly wrong for you, but every so often they'll surprise you with flowers or dinner or say something nice, and it makes you relent a little bit until you end up staying with them way longer than you ever would or should have if they'd never bothered at all.<br /><br />I will say that it made me feel much better about my own 15-year-old self.  Sure, I was a lot of gloom and doom, and sometimes when I read old journal entries from that time, I kind of want to drown past-me in a toilet.  But at least I had a personality.  I was a human being.  Charlie is...worse than a robot.  He's bad fiction trying to be deep.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Okay, so it's not entirely historically accurate.  I majored in History and I got over that, so everyone else should too.  Tom Berenger and Jeff Daniels give two of the most incredible performances I have seen on film.  The \\"extras\\" are actually civil war reenactors who went to Gettysburg and camped on the battlefield (with permission) to make this film.  When Martin Sheen needed to check a pocket watch on film, the producers just got one from the extras, knowing that it would be period-accurate!<br /><br />It's long.  Running time is about 3 hours 30 minutes, but it is worth it!  The film covers the three days of battle and the two days on either side, so it covers the set up and the aftermath.  Finally, this is the last film performance by Richard Jordan (he portrays Gen. Armistead, the man who physically led \\"Pickett's Charge\\"), and his performance is simply amazing.<br /><br />The film's authentic feel and true emotional performances rise above any of the minor historical problems.  Leave those issues in another room and watch this film sometime around July 1st through 3rd, and bring a box of tissues with you.  It is one of the few ways I know to truly appreciate what our ancestors suffered for all of us and this country.

B000002VMD|5.0|&#34;I Will Always Love You&#34; was a record-breaking number one hit in the early 1990's, and this album reminds us why.  Whitney Houston's performance in the movie might have been questionable, but nothing about her musical performance should be.  From her hard rock sound on &#34;Queen of the Night,&#34; to her gospel roots in &#34;Jesus Loves Me,&#34; Whitney's voice soars, as it always did at its best.  This is the Whitney her fans loved and should own.<br /><br />The remaining tracks from the other artists add additional interest, but can't compare to Whitney's sound.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I love this case. It keeps my kindle super safe and I don't need to worry about it flipping open or not holding the kindle snug enough. My fire snaps in and it becomes quite difficult to remove. The body of the case is a soft yet strong plastic that has a good feel and isn't too strong or brittle. The front cover is softer and has a cloth inside that wont scratch the screen. The case has an elastic band that holds the cover closed and has held up very well, no stretching or fraying. The front cover does fold in half and works as a stand, it slips into a small ridge in the back of the case and hold the kindle at a good angle for a table. My problem is I rarely use my kindle on a table. If I'm streaming a movie to it in bed I cannot use the stand because the cover slips out of the ridge on a soft bed.<br /><br />In all I am very happy with the case and its great protection. Would purchase again.
B001CQONKY|4.0|I bought the ones with Grissom as he is my favorite character. I recently bought seasons 3-8 and am currently watching season 5. I loved the show when it first came out, so I am sure that season 8 was good.

B008TRUDAS|3.0|This book was well written, it just wasn't all that interesting to me.  I think sometimes you find a great author but the particular book you are reading isn't your thing.  That is what Slammed was for me.  I would have liked more of an edge to the book, but it wasn't called for and would have been out of place in this story.  I will be on the lookout for more Colleen Hoover since I did enjoy her writing style.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I read Tim's last book, \\"The 4 Hour Body\\" and have lost close to 30 lbs following his advice.  So it was a no-brainer picking up his new book.  I was looking forward to all the great \\"slow-carb\\" recipes, but was blown away by his strategy on learning new skills.  I am a cartoonist by trade and Tim's approach has lead me to view my artistic skills in a whole new way.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I don't feel that real strides were made on the part of Christian in this book to help his relationship with Ana.  Yes there were promises and flowers and &#34;more&#34;, but the character did not develop enough in this lengthy second installment, he was still very much the control freak tending toward stalker and much of it made me uneasy, and I am not talking about the sex, rather his treatment of Ana when they should have been doing anything else.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The Sound of Music was great before the re-do in Blu-ray; But now, all I can say is WOW! A magnificent upgrade - if you are a fan of this movie and want to experience it as if seeing it for the 1st time you should make the purchase. The picture quality: 5 Star plus. The audio: very impressive. You will see and hear things you weren't aware existed when the movie was originally released. Well worth the price.

To make this short, if you enjoy music by Queen or just enjoy watching video from a bygone era in general, you should add this disc to your collection.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I chose this book because I like most of Grisham's work. I was not disappointed in this story. The story line is so well written and the plot development was excellent. However, I admit that there were several passages that made me wonder if somehow I was reading a different book. But the story line continues to develop after a bit and I see the reason for the short detour. The story has many turns, crossovers and surprises. This is a book that you don't want to put down but when you have to put it down you will be looking forward to getting it back up again. Just buy it.

Joe does a great job with exposing the flaws in his characters and their struggle with redemption or lack there of.  No rainbows and dancing unicorns in his books!  Whether it is the publisher or the Kindle for iPad app, much of the quotation punctuation marks were missing.  It was tough to tell when conversations began and ended in the book.

0811877485|3.0|I got these for my son's 2nd birthday party.  After reading the reviews, I knew that they came packaged such that the larger decals were folded.  Some reviewers mentioned that the tack wasn't strong enough to hold the folded decals on the wall, and they're right.  Because I was only using these for a party, it wasn't too big of a deal, but one side of the caterpillar had to be pushed back on the wall the entire time the decorations were up.  (The butterfly would have done this as well, but I had it stuck to a mirror and the glass surface held better than the wall.)  This would be a very big deal if you were trying to decorate a room with these long-term.
0307341550|5.0|SHARP OBJECTS had never truly been on my radar. I owned a copy (one of the first books I ever bought on my Kindle) but I conveniently managed to forget about it for several months. By several, I mean about 20. It was just after that time where my love of suspense/horror faded for the umpteenth time to be replaced with another obsession. It took awhile to finally come back to it, drawn by an unknown force that propelled me to give it another... well, a first look.<br /><br />Let me just say, this book took me by surprise. It punched me in the gut, shook me, and left me to die on a sidewalk while it giggled at my broken mind.<br /><br />I am generally not a big fan of mysteries, suspense dramas, etc. I rarely read them outside of something that comes highly rated to me. Or at least not since my little departure from the genre awhile back. Falling into the dark, disturbing town of Wind Gap was quite a departure from the ordinary for me. SHARP OBJECTS is a bleak book filled with horrible mother/daughter relationships, obsession, drugs, self-harm, mutilation, and of course murder. It is a mind boggling book that freaked me out from beginning to end. And that's a good thing.<br /><br />Camille Preaker might be one of the strangest heroines (or anti-heroine) you'll ever meet in fiction. Her obsession is with cutting, but being a journalist has put her in a rather precarious spot - her assignment is to go back to her hometown when two girls are brutally murdered and right back into the arms of her very unloving mother, into a home that damaged her permanently for life. With this trip home brings back every memory, every event that turned her into the extremely flawed woman she is today.<br /><br />The massive cast of characters is amazingly complex and well-drawn. Camille herself is a case study in insanity, but you add in her mother (crazy), sister (crazy), friends (crazy), and boss (surprisingly not so crazy), and you have this ingenious look at a town so consumed with the darkness of humanity that even their actions in speaking with one another give you chills. When you get to the actual murders, though, you find yourself looking at some of the most disturbing literature you have read all year.<br /><br />I won't get into explicit detail with this one. Let's just say that SHARP OBJECTS is a novel that must be read to be believed. I finished it in two days (punctuated by work - at which I raved about this one) and immediately knew that Gillian Flynn was a new favorite author. I went out and bought DARK PLACES and GONE GIRL after finishing this.<br /><br />If you are easily freaked out, and if being freaked out freaks you out, then this probably is not the book for you. But otherwise, go and buy this one. It's a few years old but worth it.<br /><br />VERDICT: A disturbing vision of a small town with a dark underbelly, SHARP OBJECTS is one of my favorite reads of 2012.

1936608618|5.0|If knowledge is power and speed thrills, then you will want to study every detail in Brian MacKenzie's new book entitled \\"Power Speed Endurance\\".  At 416 pages this book is akin to a college textbook but more valuable in its content and it is bound to become the defacto approach to endurance training.<br /> For anyone familiar with MacKenzie they will know that he and his CrossFit Endurance (CFE) program have begun to question and shift the paradigm in endurance training away from the long slow distance model (LSD) toward a skill based approach to training incorporating the CrossFit strength and conditioning ideology.  This shift in emphasis allows for athletes to develop their technique, reduce their training volume thereby decreasing their likelihood for injury, move more efficiently, recover quicker and perform better.<br /> From beginning to end \\"Power Speed Endurance\\" is full of insights that can only be gleaned from a practitioner as passionate about their profession as MacKenzie.  He introduces the CFE model and philosophy in a common sense manner avoiding a lot of the technical jargon that can prompt a reader to get lost in the details.  Recognizing that running is possibly the most dangerous sport out there, the first chapter is devoted to developing this skill through emphasis on the Pose Running methodology developed originally by Dr. Nicholas Romanov.  This approach is not only sensible but easy enough to learn and follow.  Included within the book are countless pictures, diagrams, exercises and drills to assist the reader in learning.<br /> Doug Katona, the CFE cycling expert, handles the chapter devoted to cycling.  Here the book covers everything from fitting your bike and equipment, to body position, pedal stroke and cornering.  There are even sections covering Time Trials and the relevant mountain bike variations compared to road bikes.<br /> The third and final technique chapter is handled by Chris Michelmore and covers swimming as a skill.  Here you will get great insights into the freestyle stroke and backstroke as these are the two long-axis strokes.  Simply put, these are the two strokes that allow for maximal distance to be covered with minimal energy consumption.  Various drills, breathing techniques and body positions are dissected and explained so that readers can easily implement what they have read into their next training session.<br /> Mackenzie then implements a chapter on strength and conditioning.  This is where the CFE formula starts to put gears into the machine so to speak.  By incorporating a Westside Barbell / CrossFit conditioning conjugate system, MacKenzie is able to demonstrate how endurance athletes can become stronger, faster and more powerful than their peers.  This chapter is where readers will be introduced to a variety of power, strength and gymnastics exercises designed to correct any flaws that exist in their bodies.<br /> Kelly Starrett, who also has a book coming out, devotes a chapter to flexibility.  This chapter alone is a must read whether you are an endurance athlete or couch potato with chronic soft tissue issues.  Take this chapter for a test run and you will surely be as supple as a leopard when you finish.<br /> Nutrition, hydration and electrolyte balance are addressed in the same straight- forward style consistent throughout this book.  Finally, the reader is given a guide on how to make sense of it all when it comes to implementing this training solution on a daily basis.<br /> If you walk into your local book store you would need to purchase multiple books to get the collective insights brought together in this one title.  If you are an endurance athlete with an open mind to less traditional training approaches and you want to set PR's at every turn, then this is the one and only book you will ever need.

B007FEFLTO|2.0|Or, \\"How That Pesky World War II Annoyingly Interrupted Our Sex Lives.\\"<br /><br />\\"Winter of the World\\" by formerly great author Ken Follett is pure made-for-TV soap opera. It isn't literature, not even for  one page, and it's way too long, too boring and too badly written.<br /><br />For example, the desultory, adolescent writing includes this perfect example of how far Follett has descended. From Page 510, \\"After dinner they went to the cinema. The movie was great. Then Woody and Chuck walked the girls back to their apartment. On the way, Woody took Joanne's hand. She smiled and squeezed his hand, and he took that for encouragement.\\" Geez, Mr. Follett, is that the best you can do these days? Or did someone else so creatively write this paragraph? One of your grandchildren? Whatever happened to the Follett we knew in \\"Eye of the Needle\\" and \\"Pillars of the Earth\\"?<br /><br />The fundamental concept for this mostly uninteresting 940-page story is to relate the history of one of the most blockbuster eras the world has ever seen, through the pedestrian lives and loves of a few characters, whose coincidental path-crossing (and long-lost blood relationships) requires a reader to suspend disbelief -- page after page. The pitfalls of this device are 1) abrupt, herky-jerky scene shifts and time warps; 2) unfinished scenarios (the characters simply and magically move on to new adventures without adequate resolution to the previous action; 3) summarily dropped themes and action sequences. Stated simply, the story resembles the old TV sit-com, \\"Days of Our Lives,\\" only it was better.<br /><br />There is much too much reliance on way too often idiotic dialogue to advance the crucial historical/political/social/hegemony story of the time. It's like asking a perfectly sensible but ill-informed shop owner in Missouri to explain the 2012 \\"fiscal cliff\\".<br /><br />Worst of all, the characters, in all their ordinariness, become little more than boring stereotypes. The story is filled with hate, especially toward Russians, even though there are several pro-Soviet enthusiastic characters. While there are many pro-British and pro-American characters, there is not one single believable Nazi. Thus, there is no attempt at balance and virtually no development of the complexity of issues of the time. It boils down to a pro-English speaker's paean. Disappointing, that. Kind of like Faux News.<br /><br />There were some passing good parts. 1) Pearl Harbor, December 1941; 2) Russians taking Berlin in 1945; 3) The rise of women in politics and place in society; 4) 1946 when Churchill's party lost the election in Britain; 5) the atom bomb test in New Mexico in 1945; 6) Explanation of the War in Spain in the 1930s.<br /><br />For the first time in the history of his long writing career, Follett explores the topic of homosexuality in some other way than merely dismissing it as a need-to-be-hidden aberration. Good. Congratulations.<br /><br />He tries desperately to get into the heads and hearts of anti-Nazi Germans throughout the story, though resorts to stick figures and soap-opera uber-drama to do so, resulting in his characters oozing with insincere angst and making childish, panicky decisions.<br /><br />Any characters to admire?  Hmmmm, maybe all those Welsh Williams family members. As I wrote in my review of \\"Fall of Giants\\" (the first of this 3-book trilogy), those Brits remain his best-developed characters.<br /><br />I did read it through to the end. It is not spell-binding nor is it a page-turner, and I never said to myself, \\"Hey, I wonder what's happening to these Follett characters in `Winter of the World'\\"? Nothing about them or the story (other than the already elsewhere documented history of the era) is memorable. For someone like me who loves the history of before, during and after WWII, this book is nothing but a huge let-down and probably will be the last book of Follett's I will ever read. Pity. I really liked some of his earlier works.<br /><br />Thus, sadly, it's a 2.00 on Amazon's rating scale and not anywhere close to being worth the outrageous $19.99 Kindle price.

B007EE4XKI|4.0|I like this book because it  was like watching a great Star Trek tv show.It starts fast and flows all the way to great ending.<br />The only problem I have with this story the Worf part of the story its great but how much can happen to one character before it becomes cliche.I recomend this book for those who love all the star trek stories that shows all the great qualities of the star trek<br />t.v. series.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I am a big Nelson DeMille fan and loved most of his previous books.  I think John Corey is a fun character with his wise-ass attitude.  Unfortunately, this book was so bogged down with interdepartmental issues, (FBI, CIA, NYPD, other secret, quasi military/spy organizations), that there was very little action and the small amount of action, (confronting the Panther), didn't start until the second to last chapter.  Most of the book focused on assembling the team that was to go after the Panther, their mistrust of each other, their personal backgrounds, etc.  So, I do not recommend this book.
B000RLHDUM|4.0|I like Pierce Brosnan, although I don't like all of his movies.  This movie is a remake of an old Steve McQueen flick.  Great remake.  I don't much care for Rene Russo, but she did a good job in this one.  Entertaining, suspenseful, very likable.  Great for a date movie or just to watch a clever dude have some fun.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Caitlin Moran is a very talented writer.  This book is about contemporary feminism and related issues, dating, breasts, periods, family, social issues, etc.  Caitlin is very very funny.  Her essays are rants, but always confront the truths that exist in the world of contemporary women.  Refreshing and unusual.  My husband loved it too!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is a comedy genius. Her book was so entertaining, I actually laughed out loud. I cannot wait for her to write another book.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Overall: The absolute must have replacement keyboard available. Many keyboards try to provide the best typing experience but SwiftKey performs. The prediction capabilities for this keyboard are like no other. The beauty is that while you only get 3 prediction choices, that is all you really need. A must have essential app that everyone should give a try. The free version gives you a taste for a month before taking away the best part, the predictions. After that, it is time to commit. But trust me, using this keyboard is the best choice you could make.<br /><br />Pros: The keyboard layout is nice for typing, especially using the 2 thumb method on portrait mode. Once you get going with the typing, the predictions just keep coming which makes the app a little scary in how good it is at guessing what you will want to say next. This is especially true for phrases that you say the most and for corrections which occur almost simultaneously. The keyboard understands your intent most of the time and is able to figure out for the most part what word you tried to spell. This gives for very quick typing because it no longer matters if you hit the exact key order anymore! As a last point, the symbol keys are very quick to be pressed and there is only one choice per key. An example would be that when the letter 'q' is held down, the number 1 pops up almost immediately.<br /><br />Cons: Not many. I would say that actually having to spell a new word or one not used much can be a hassle, which means that you have to precisely type the word out. Additionally, one finger typing is not this keyboard's strong suite even though it is still fast using this method (Swype is much faster using one finger). Lastly, the landscape layout is not my favorite as keys are spaced far apart, especially on bigger screens.<br /><br />Most useful feature: The quick erase function. Much like the ctrl + backspace on Microsoft Word, you can erase the previous word by simply swiping right to left. This is really cool because then you no longer have to stop to erase, just swipe and go!

B0075MFS9Y|2.0|I bought this based on reviews and the 30 second samples. It apparently sounded good to me at the time. But I've played it twice now and have absolutely no desire to play it again. I don't want it to grow on me. It's one of the few cd's I own that I'm considering just throwing away. Nothing worked for me on this one. Not one song.
B009FXIICK|3.0|A clone of so many other games, but with animals.  Just like bubble breakers, or one of those games, meh.

B006LSZECO|4.0|It was pretty good throughout the majority of the book.  Disappointed in the very end.  I would still recommend it.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|I enjoyed reading \\"Mulholland Drive\\" on my Kindle, but I was happier that it cost less than $3.00. I would say that I got my money's worth. I love Michael Connelly's books, so it was an adjustment when the story would end so abruptly. And a surprise to find a continuation of the same story line later on. I purchased 2 other short story books by the same author, and some stories are better than others. I intend to visit Amazon again and purchase some more Kindle versions of the short stories, and maybe even a regular book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I got hooked on the first book and the second was just as good.  It was a little different to most books I've read and now look forward to seeing the films.  They are usually not as good as the books but it will be interesting how the story is depicted.
B0083BYZMM|5.0|Beautiful jazzy arrangements for some of their hits. What a perfect CD for a wintery evening with a cup of apple cider and cinnamon - or a breezy summer day in a hammock.<br />One of their favourite CDs ever!
B000053VJI|5.0|I liked this cd. I rated 5 star b/c I liked the cd. I recommend it to all who love latin music.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I wanted to finish the book because  I had heard so much about it but I didn't really care for it.  I thought it would get better and I wanted to see how it ended.  I have no plans to read the others in the series.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|..this book gives you insight into the lives of our elite fighters, their enormous dedication and commitment to their profession. the relentless training, disciplin, and their resources. It shows how excellent planning allows to excecute missions even under the worst circumstances. (Helicopter malfunction). This is a good book.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love Jack Reacher. If I were in trouble, I would love him to come to my rescue. Read this book.
B002K0WBYG|4.0|Only reason I put &#34;I like it&#34; is because the seller didn't mention that the digital copy couldn't be copied onto my computer because the code expired years ago!  They should not have advertised the digital copy because it can't be used.  I love this movie.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I shared this with our church, the movie was well done and of course it had superb story.  Thank you

B00846REIS|3.0|In my opinion it's so similar to 50 Shades of Grey that it's predictable.  I had no desire to finish the second book because I felt like I already know what's going to happen.  I won't purchase book 3.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is by far the best series I have read. I'm actually sad its over. The books kept me interested the whole way through . Never a dull moment.
B005Z271Y6|3.0|It is not up to me to judge Adele as she has been very successful and I like her music yet here is my opinion: If you are going to Video a concert first make sure Adele is compleltely over her chest cold, second I wish she would not let the Audience sing while she holds the Mic (Probably to rest her voice yet most singers do that anyway) because it is distracting unless you like to hear 10,000 people trying to sing, and Thirdly put a warning on the label &#34;Foul Language&#34;. I did not know Adele had so much anger yet I suppose that anger and language is her persona. How can I judge such a successful singer? I cannot, but put the kids to bed first unless they are used to foul language. YET, I would BUY another. 3 stars for this concert that could have easily have been 5 Star if she had not been sick and all the other stuff. Again, I still Love her music.
B008NA3I30|4.0|Someone seems to say \\"life is between boredom and anxiety\\". People feel bored for what they already have and feel anxiety for what they don't. The process of knowing a new person or getting a new thing stirs the excitement. The excitement makes people feel delighted, happy and bold, which could lead to make a wrong decision and regret later. After a while, the excitement dies down, the new becomes the old, the boredom strikes again... I think the movie captures the idea very well. People who have the similar experience will find this movie is interesting and worth to watch. Otherwise, the movie might seems boring and slow.<br /><br />The important thing in the life is to figure out what is really important and hold on to them. Rather than chasing the \\"mirage\\" created by the excitement, it is better to ride out the boredom by discovering new trait from old people or things, include ourself. So when you feel you will give in to the temptation, you can watch this movie and see whether you still want to do it or not.
B005LAIIRQ|4.0|Yes , one can discern the animatronic wolves in some sequences . The journey and acting (particularly by Mr. Neeson) are the point . That i got a subtle and unexpected reveal near the film's end , just put a bow on it for me . I really like this film and now own a copy . Looks like folks are strongly divided ? That's often the case in harsh and/or brutal films . This film will settle into a four star recommendation in the years to come . I also strongly believe that .
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This series has been compared to Fifty Shades. I do not find it comparable. This second book has sparked more interest. I liked that Gideon has consuming love for Eva. I found it smart that Eva begins to unravel some of Gideon's past.  The ending of this book propels one to see what the next book brings.  The character Carey is interesting and I hope he becomes more developed in the third book. Still a good read for entertainment .

0143039431|4.0|The Grapes of Wrath is a well written, intriguing, darn good book. I was truly impressed by the art and detail that is put into this novel. The book begins with the telling of the truly hospitable conditions that farmers in the south-eastern plains were experiencing. The story follows a family named the Joad's and their desire and pursuit to get to California in search of work, easier times, and a happy life. Tom Joad, who is the main character in the book, is one who I became attached to early on, because of his rash and hasty nature, but kind and merciful attitude. His journey and growth really captured me through-out the whole book.<br /><br />The theme of the book was quite interesting. Humanism, unity, family, and the concept of the Oversoul persist in being the top reasons behind all the events that transpire in the book. The concept of Humanism, family, and the moral reasoning of leaving no man behind are powerful things. Ma Joad, mother of Tom, demonstrates the greatest form of humanism and family, by always wanting to help others in need, and making sure that people were working together to accomplish goals. She is also the one person in the family that is constantly trying to keep the family intact and functioning. Ma even gets physical when she feels her family is going to be broken up. This leads to the next theme, which is unity. Unity is shown in both the camps of people that the Joad's come across, and in a bigger sense of family, the community. The groups of people that the family stumbles across are groups in which everyone had a place, and people worked for the benefit of each other, not themselves. This is something that really takes a mental toll on some of the main characters, who go on to enact their newfound sense of place. Jim Casy, a former preacher, joins the Joad's early on in the book, and is really trying to figure out how to help people who are in need of spiritual help. He comes upon the idea of a shared soul, and no one person being separated from another. This concept of the Oversoul has a profound effect on both Tom and Jim Casy, who make steps towards who they are going to become through-out the book.<br /><br />This is a book that I truly do like, for all the detail and gritty realness of the whole situation that many people were in. However, it can get very dry, very quickly. The first part of the book definitely takes it's time to pick up, which it does, and it becomes very interesting after that point. The character development was excellent and I became enticed with the people surrounding the story.<br /><br />I recommend this book to those who want to read about the harsh conditions and times that people went through, but beware of some long, uninteresting conversations about life.eparated from another.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|John Grisham's days of writing legal thrillers seem to have ended several books ago.  \\"The Racketeer\\", although fairly fast-paced once past the beginning, is the story of Malcolm Bannister, a disbarred lawyer who is in a federal prison camp in Frostburg, MD.  A federal judge and his secretary have been murdered and a very secure, state-of-the-art safe is found open and empty.  Malcolm Bannister tells the warden he knows who killed the judge and why.<br /><br />The remaining story and the characters introduced I found not the most believable in all twenty-three of Grisham's novels I've read.  Surely there were simpler ways around such elaborately plotted out plans of action than what took place.  I lost track of the story a couple of times and when the book ended, I turned the page expecting more, but there was no more.<br /><br />This is not one of my favorite John Grisham novels, but I liked it more than \\"The Litigators.\\"  There are only a few authors whose books I pre-order and I will continue ordering John Grisham's books as long as I'm alive and he writes.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the fact that the show is not so much about zombies, but more about the 'human condition.' It makes me wonder if a massive plague took out 95% of the population, how fast would the remaining 5% turn on one another. You'd think people would ban together to survive...I guess not.
B00008NG5V|5.0|I love the songs and its a realley good cd to hang out and have a great time at home!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|This is the opinion of a vinyl nerd who has more Beatles records than anyone would need.<br /><br />Either people are imagining defects in their Beatles Vinyl Box, or I hit the lottery with a perfect, unblemished box in every way imaginable.  There is no \\"zipper sound\\" and no \\"string of pearls\\" on any of the LPs.  First and foremost, let me say (with ABSOLUTE confidence) that these sound even better than the CD remasters from '09.  The sound is full, dynamic, and without question worth every penny.  The only critique that I would have is that the vocals at times seem slightly low in the mix.  This is not a problem, at least for me it isn't.  Many people are comparing these to the MFSL vinyl pressings.  I will admit that my Please Please Me MFSL will never be topped, even if it is a bit bright.  Having said that, the Please Please Me in the new box is more than worthy in its own right -- it just has more low end and the vocals are slightly lower in the mix.<br /><br />The book is outrageously gorgeous; it is the book I will use to introduce my children to The Beatles.  No one is disputing the quality of the book, so I won't spend time describing it.<br /><br />With so many complaints about the Abbey Road album from this box, I spent a good amount of time inspecting the vinyl with my eyes and ears -- it's perfect.  In this case, it is BETTER than the MFSL pressing.<br /><br />Finally, I suspect that the remastering process raised the levels of the fade-outs of songs because I am hearing so many things I have never heard before in the thousands of times I have heard these songs.  While I don't think this was \\"intended\\" to be heard in the original mixes -- purists hate any change -- it makes for a better listening experience.<br /><br />So, in closing, I LOVE this box and highly recommend it.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|People think Metallica are lucky to still be around (and not to mention have a large following of fans) after going through some very hostile inner-turmoil (which was well summarized on 2003's \\"Some Kind Of Monster\\" documentary). And some think they are lucky to emerge from a very public lawsuit brought on by drummer Lars Ulrich against Napster's illegal downloading. But what Lars, guitarist Kirk Hammett, vocalist/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield, and newbie bassist Robert Trujillo (who is of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne fame) are actually lucky to recover from is releasing a string of highly controversial albums. Indeed, 1991's mainstream-breakthrough \\"The Black Album,\\" 1996's and `97's thrash-less, blues-oriented releases (\\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\"), and 2003's nu-metal-tinged \\"St. Anger\\" all met with mixed reactions from fans everywhere.<br /><br />But Metallica finally rebounded with a new full-length, their ninth, 2008's \\"Death Magnetic.\\" Sounding hungrier than ever before,  the seminal Californian thrash quartet are armed to the teeth with a new arsenal of great riffs and solos, as well as some exceptional drumming and decent bass lines. There are tons of killer hooks present here, too. All of which make \\"D.M\\" a triumphant return to form, and easily one of the best, and most consistent and viscerally satisfying efforts of Metallica's career. Of course, part of what makes this new record so genius is the inclusion of a new producer, Rick Rubin (who has also turned knobs for such heavy metal legends as Slayer and Black Sabbath). His production job is crisp, thunderous, and polished but not overly so. Thus, instead of sanding down the edges on the songs and riffs, Rubin actually sharpens and intensifies them. Plus, Lars' drums sound a lot less overwhelmingly, obnoxiously loud than they were on \\"St. Anger.\\" Sure, Trujillo' bass could stand to be a little bit louder in the mix -- but when the end result is this all-around great, all is easily forgiven.<br /><br />Opener \\"That Wasn't Just Your Life\\" definitely has more-than-enough potential and things going for it to make it a hit single, and a mosh pit-ready new staple in Metallica's live show. It is a loud and abrasive conglomeration of jarring power chords and \\"Ride The Lightning\\"-era blistering thrash riffage. And when a catchy, adherent thrashing groove, some impressive drumming -- including a surprisingly brutal blast beat pattern -- powerful and stirring choruses, and a blazing guitar solo are added to the mix, the end result is an instant classic. \\"The End Of The Line\\" is an explosive and extremely crunchy follow-up that is brimming with cascading, near chainsaw-fast stutter-step riffage. Some catchy, sing-songy choruses, really deft and energetic drumming, and steady, bouncy bass lines are also featured, here, and Kirk tosses in a surprisingly unorthodox, but still very ripping, wah-drenched solo, to boot. But what stands out the most about this song is, again, the riffage -- it is just so razor-sharp and biting that it evokes Eighties-era pure thrash.<br /><br />\\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\\" is immediately engaging, as it weaves sharply hooky, crunching riff slices and forceful drumming through irresistible stop-start hooks. It lets loose another terrific guitar solo, too. Next up, \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" begins sounding like a \\"Black Album\\"-era ballad, and ends up as straight-up, frenetically fast thrash melee. It opens on a pretty and very minor-key note with Kirk weaving subtle, sinewy melodic guitar lines and ambient harmonies, thus adding some depth and variation to the musical arrangements. But soon enough the song transforms into a punishing slab of walloping, blasting drums and breakneck speed picking. It also boasts a very catchy and rhythmic, galloping beat, and a solo that is quite possibly the finest you will find anywhere on here. (It is a wailing, vertigo-inducing solo that just builds and builds...then it builds some more, thus helping to ensure that \\"The Day...\\" has an undeniable epic vibe to it.)<br /><br />\\"All Nightmare Long\\" opens with a nice bit of calming guitar melodies. No worries, though, because gobs of excellent, smoking, nimble-fingered buzzsaw riffing -- anchored by a stomping, thundering rhythm section -- abound soon thereafter. But this tune is more than just a throwback to Metallica's olden days, and it is different than the rest of the album. Much different, in fact. See, it features some astonishingly complex and technical time signatures, including plenty of \\"math-y\\" stops and starts, and fast tempo changes. Back on more traditional ground, \\"Cyanide\\" is \\"Death Magnetic\\"'s hit lead single. It features good bass work -- i.e. a Motorhead-esque bass intro and a steady, and kind of funky-sounding bass bottom -- throughout. And it doesn't stop there, either, because it is also home to another excellent guitar solo, some catchy, bouncy rhythms, and one of the best and most infectious choruses in Metallica's playbook.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what comes next is the record's sole stinker. Yes, \\"The Unforgiven III\\" might have a nicely somber piano intro and James' trademark crooning. But for the most part, this meandering, self-indulgent, and just plain boring ballad goes nowhere, adds nothing, and fails to stick with the listener for very long after hearing it. It is overlong, too. But whatever \\"The Unforgiven III\\" lacks in punch, \\"The Judas Kiss\\" makes up for and then some. It is an exhilarating barrage of blazing tempos and brutal balls of scorching, ripping modern thrash riffage and machine-gun-fast double bass drumming. Kirk does his part in making it a really memorable and air-guitar-able piece with both the above-described riff work and another epic, lengthy, wah-wah-inflected solo. And James' Judas Priest-y singing, triumphant, sing/shout along-worthy choruses, and noteworthy lyrics (which are very dark and cryptic) complete the song.<br /><br />\\"Suicide & Redemption\\" is a brilliantly-written, epic, expansive, and meticulous instrumental song that falls just short of being ten whole minutes long. It might not exactly be, say, \\"Orion,\\" but it is the first instrumental Metallica have recorded since their \\"...And Justice For All Days.\\" It is a terrifically hard-driving and hard-rocking cut that stitches together thrashy and blood-pumping tempos with ominously slower, and at times almost sludgy, Alice In Chains-worthy riffs. However, the set concludes with \\"My Apocalypse,\\" a totally straightforward, heads down riff-fest from start to finish. It just oozes with chunky, blustery, and sometimes even Slayer-worthy speed picking. Of course, the riffage wouldn't be quite as effective, here, if it weren't complimented well by crunching bass lines, pounding drums, and power metal-lite, fun-loving vocals.<br /><br />True, this might be the kind of album that you are just dying to hate. (If you listen closely enough, you might be able to hear some critics sharpening their knives before listening to it.) But it is also, simultaneously, an impossible album to hate. After all, \\"Death Magnetic\\" is a rewarding, satiating new millennium thrasherpiece, and a glorious return to studded form for James and the Gang. And it forgives any and all of the band's wrongdoings in the past (except for maybe the whole Napster debacle), and resoundingly answers any lingering questions that you might have about the band. (Yes, they are still relevant, inspired, and brutal as ever.) So just buy it, dang you, buy it, because trust me, folks, this record is one for the ages!The Day...\\" has an undeniable epic vibe to it.)<br /><br />\\"All Nightmare Long\\" opens with a nice bit of calming guitar melodies. No worries, though, because gobs of excellent, smoking, nimble-fingered buzzsaw riffing -- anchored by a stomping, thundering rhythm section -- abound soon thereafter. But this tune is more than just a throwback to Metallica's olden days, and it is different than the rest of the album. Much different, in fact. See, it features some astonishingly complex and technical time signatures, including plenty of \\"math-y\\" stops and starts, and fast tempo changes. Back on more traditional ground, \\"Cyanide\\" is \\"Death Magnetic\\"'s hit lead single. It features good bass work -- i.e. a Motorhead-esque bass intro and a steady, and kind of funky-sounding bass bottom -- throughout. And it doesn't stop there, either, because it is also home to another excellent guitar solo, some catchy, bouncy rhythms, and one of the best and most infectious choruses in Metallica's playbook.<br /><br />Unfortunately, what comes next is the record's sole stinker. Yes, \\"The Unforgiven III\\" might have a nicely somber piano intro and James' trademark crooning. But for the most part, this meandering, self-indulgent, and just plain boring ballad goes nowhere, adds nothing, and fails to stick with the listener for very long after hearing it. It is overlong, too. But whatever \\"The Unforgiven III\\" lacks in punch, \\"The Judas Kiss\\" makes up for and then some. It is an exhilarating barrage of blazing tempos and brutal balls of scorching, ripping modern thrash riffage and machine-gun-fast double bass drumming. Kirk does his part in making it a really memorable and air-guitar-able piece with both the above-described riff work and another epic, lengthy, wah-wah-inflected solo. And James' Judas Priest-y singing, triumphant, sing/shout along-worthy choruses, and noteworthy lyrics (which are very dark and cryptic) complete the song.<br /><br />\\"Suicide & Redemption\\" is a brilliantly-written,epic, expansive, and meticulous instrumental song that falls just short of being ten whole minutes long. It might not exactly be, say, \\"Orion,\\" but it is the first instrumental Metallica have recorded since their \\"...And Justice For All Days.\\" It is a terrifically hard-driving and hard-rocking cut that stitches together thrashy and blood-pumping tempos with ominously slower, and at times almost sludgy, Alice In Chains-worthy riffs. However, the set concludes with \\"My Apocalypse,\\" a totally straightforward, heads down riff-fest from start to finish. It just oozes with chunky, blustery, and sometimes even Slayer-worthy speed picking. Of course, the riffage wouldn't be quite as effective, here, if it weren't complimented well by crunching bass lines, pounding drums, and power metal-lite, fun-loving vocals.<br /><br />True, this might be the kind of album that you are just dying to hate.

B001QOGYBI|5.0|Was extremely pleased with the quality of product and the fact that it came so fast! Great Christmas stocking stuffer.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I'm thrilled with the utility of Flipboard! What a great app--for one thing it organizes all those social apps that otherwise have their own apps with different interfaces, settings, etc. Second, all news now comes up in same format for easy handling. Third, everything has the same look, making it easy on the eyes and the mind. Finally, there are all kinds of curated collections if you don't have enough stuff of your own to pour over!<br /><br />Why ALMOST a five? I'm trying to integrate my Pocket account for reading it later, and this has been rather nightmarish. Support is prompt but seems uninformed about the Kindle Fire HD interface, so help isn't particularly applicable. Hopefully this will change soon. All in all, I really do love Flipboard and really REALLY hope it will get worked out.
0345803485|5.0|To me, the end of the plot was exciting, cliff hanging, and surprising.  Who can resist a happy endings and sexy people.
0316227706|5.0|I loved everthing about this book. This is sure to put a smile on your face. who would of thought that they make the funniest faces under water! We share plenty of smiles over Thanksgiving looking at it with the family!
0345803507|5.0|What little plot there is in this first book of the Trilogy is enhanced by the clever and witty writting.  I started and finished in about 4 days; and did not feel cheated in the story.
B009D5VPTI|4.0|As an adult I loved the movie and the scenes of the landscapes were breathtaking. I watched it with my 2 and 4 year old grandchildren. They were really into it until the mean bear came into the movie then they started shouting turn it off, turn it off lol. It was a little to much for them. I do love the movie and plan on showing it to them when they get a little older.
0345803493|5.0|The author reveals more of the characters' backgrounds and reasons for being the way they are.  I found a little more compassion for both of the main characters as the story plot starts to develop into a interesting read.
B0086700CM|4.0|I really enjoy the game.  its simple yet addictive.  everytime my character dies I keep saying to myself &quot;one more run&quot;.
0786838655|5.0|For the last couple of weeks, my class has been reading Percy Jackson's and the Olympians The Lightning Thief.  In the beginning Percy doesn't know about his powers and that he is son of Poseidon (God of the Sea).  So later in the book Percy learns more and more about his powers.<br /><br />The book is about a boy named Percy who has a mom named Sally and a stepdad named \\"Smelly\\" Gabe.  When on vacation with his mom, Percy finds out he is a demigod (half human, half God).  He goes to camp half blood and while going there his mom gets captured.  At the camp he is sent on a quest to find Zeus' lightning bolt (he also went on the quest to find his mom).  Percy travels all around the USA with Annabeth and Grover to find the lightning bolt and his mother.<br /><br />My favorite part was when Percy fought Ares (Ares is the God of War).  I liked this part because it explained the fight with a lot of detail.  I would recommend this book to adults, kids, and people who like books about Gods.  I would give it 5 stars!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|i just did the play of this movie at my school!!! and at the cast party we watched the movie!! but we were all hyped up on suger, so we were just joking around and laughing. at one point, when belle was singing to the sheep, my friend shouted out,\\"Sheep!! Sheep are awsome!!!\\" overall this is a great movie. the only problem was, it skipped something there and then it was out of sinic until the mob song. oh yeah!! when we watched it at the cast party, the girl who played belle said,\\"She's way priettier then me,but she can NOT pull that dress off!!\\" and then the girl who played Mrs.Potts said,\\"How many kids did i have?!\\" But when i was little the part where the beast took mourice to the doungoun scared the living CRAP out of me, because i thout he was going to EAT HIM!!!
1433502410|2.0|I gave it a 2 because although its good and informative it's not really a bible that I'd use as my main bible. What I wish this bible did have is better wording and is a little more dynamic kinda like the HCSB, I do not own it but am comtemplating on buying one just like this book. But, I'd suggest this book as a intro into theology compared to other bibles that make this bible basic. Another thing I hope they would do as far as bibles are concerned is to break each chapter up into parts, and to if possible instead of having love in the bible to describe it.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|OMG!!! this is soo funny!!! me and a bunch of friends r going to go see it when it comes out in 3D. my friend and i did the Mike<br />Wazowski thing to annoy my other friend. and i know put that thing back where it came from by heart!!! but when i was littl randle scared the CRAP out of me!! but the bloopers r the funniest part!!
B001QUP5MQ|5.0|I  went to one of the concerts (Mark Knopfler w/ Bob Dylan) and found that he was playing some songs from this album. I have most of Knopfler's discs (either Dire Straits' or solo) but was missing this one (and Privateering!... both now at home :-)<br /><br />I would recommend it to any Dire Straits/Mark Knopfler's fan. Or anyone interested in not so commercial music. It can be played in the background with a glass of wine (pint of beer, water, whatever you like) while having a conversation, or just enjoying the sheer pleasure of the melodies. (Obviously, I'm not very objective)
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Bought this for my wife as a gift and she loved it.  Personally I am not a fan of this movie, but with the Blu-Ray version you get a behind the scenes feature of some length that shows Jim Henson and crew developing the world of the Labyrinth.  After watching this I have a whole new respect for the film.  Enjoy.
1936608618|5.0|This is a great resource and must read for any endurance athlete and coach. Having completed multiple marathons, cycling events, and triathlons I wish this book was available years ago, before I spent wasted hours \\"training\\". Brian MacKenzie, Glen Cordoza and Kelly Starrett have collaborated and put together a book that touches on most aspects of endurance events (technique, strength, mobility, nutrition, efficiency and skills). This book would have helped me minimize the overuse  injury's that can linger especially doing a lot of long slow distance workouts. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve PRs and endurance.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Amazing Graphics and feel to the game.. Well Worth it.<br />Its a bit more advanced for most people.. One thing I wish it had is the ability to do bombing missions<br />combined with the landing and taking off.. Overall thumbs up..
B007MU85D0|5.0|The best debut Ive heard since Mumford & Sons Sigh No More. Every song is good, highly recommend! Buy it, now!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead Season 3 is awesome and streaming it with Amazon is very simple and easy to use with great picture quality.
034580404X|5.0|its a great book and I wish that it was more books to read instead of being a trilogy  series
B005K17RU0|3.0|The weather reports I have looked at are close to local weather reports, but if you are depending on a little more accuracy, it may not be for you. But, even the weather stations have a degree of inaccuracy. It's at least worth a look. I still use the app for a general daily report.
B009E9R2OK|1.0|Never knew that Blu-Ray AUDIO ONLY even existed.  My fault for not reading more carefully and just saw Blu Ray. However, I returned it to Amazon thinking I would only be out shipping which was fine.  Then when I got the confirmation of the return transaction that there was an additional $9.50 re-stocking charge in addition to the $2.99 shipping, I wouldn't have bothered returning it.  So, never again will I buy any Led Zeppelin media because of the \\"brilliant\\" marketing strategy of not selling just a single Blu-Ray VIDEO of the event and then selling a Blu Ray AUDIO only.  Would be interested in how many of AUDIO only are selling (not really).  I'm afraid if I re-ordered the Video, then it would be VIDEO only without the audio.  Nice job on tripping me up!!!
B007EE564U|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish could not put it down wish there was more carn't wait for the next one.
B008BTOVL6|5.0|This show is great. Love the wit and humor. I can now catch up on the episodes in order instead of when I can find them on the TV.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|THIS RE UP ALBUM AND DVD IS FREAKIN AWESOME.  NICKI IS THE BOMB, OHAY?  YOU GO MISS ROMANS YOU BAD AZZ GANSTA GOYLE, YOU.  HOPING SHE WILL SLAP MARIAH CAREY UPSIDE THE HEAD SOMETHING FIERCE BUT THAT'S JUST ME, OHAY??
B000002H5I|5.0|Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!
B00008LDPU|5.0|It is a fun movie that fills in many of the unknowns of the Matrix trilogy. I was pleased with it.<br />The movie arrived quickly, great deal, and just as the picture describes.
B009AOFNU4|5.0|I develop game software for Android and have a sizable collection of wired and wireless gaming controllers. Unfortunately I need to buy each new controller to make sure it's compatible with my software. I purchased the SSF when it first became available and paid $90 for it ($80 + $10 shipping). To communicate with the bluetooth controllers, instead of linking in each company's SDK or helper app, I prefer to reverse engineer the bluetooth protocol and communicate directly with the device. Luckily the SSF supports both HID mode (normal gamepad input on PC's and Android) and a direct connect SPP mode (RFCOMM). Some have complained that the SSF is too small, but for me it's the perfect balance of size and comfort. One of the best features of the SSF is the analog controls. They self-center, require no calibration and work smoothly in all directions. The same cannot be said for competing controllers. The Nyko Playpad and PowerA MOGA both have stiff and uneven analog controls which don't give consistent values throughout their range (-128 to +127). To sum up:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Solidly built and comfortable in the hand.<br />2) Excellent bluetooth communication which supports HID joystick and RFCOMM modes<br />3) Long battery life<br />4) The best analog nubs of any wireless bluetooth controller<br />5) Small, but comfortable - easy to carry with you.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Price - $80 is too much for a gamepad<br />2) Included soft case prevents dust, but doesn't protect it. A hard case would be better.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr, Alexander is a good writer and tells a great story.  I loved the way he went back and worth between ICU and Heaven. Put so many highlights and bookmarks in this book.  He was meant to share his experience!
