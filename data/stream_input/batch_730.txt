0385484518|5.0|This short easily read book is about the final days of a college professor that wants to share his wisdom.  It is not a sad book but one of reflection on what the needs of loved ones in that position need and indeed what you can learn from them.  I was blessed.
B000SQJ2SC|4.0|I would like to hear more religion talk coming from this man. He is a solid rapper/producer. But his content would be a lot more powerful if he just went ahead and incorporated the Gospel into his records. Pretty good though.
B00005N56Y|5.0|These recordings predate today's fads of inserting lots of flashy embellishments, inventing new (usually prolix) cadenzas, imitating the limitations of a pianoforte, accellerating tempi, and producing sparkling Mozart Lite.  All Curzon delivers is outstanding playing with plenty of feeling but no fussiness.  Curzon knew better than most musicians how to play slow music so it comes across as deep rather than boring, so he doesn't rush the slow movements as so many performers do.  He plays the usual Beethoven cadenzas in #20.    All 5 performances are polished to perfection; and the recorded sound, while not state of the art, is very good for its time (1967 - 1970).  I respectfully disagree with the reviewer who finds the piano too faint;  if anything, the widespread vice of making the solo instrument too prominent in concerto recordings has been rather narrowly avoided.    So don't buy this set to revolutionize your view of Mozart.  Buy it for great playing, full of delightful subtleties.

1932100660|5.0|Read it.  Study it.  Absorb it.  Then put it into practice.  It will save your life!  Don't listen to the lies of the medical and pharmaceutical industry any more.  Don't give into the fast (fat) food nation USA has become. Dr. Campbell provides solid evidence concerning disease and how to minimize or reverse it.  It is an excellent book and EVERY one that eats food should read it!
B000UR9T7I|4.0|This movie had a lot of hype built up about it, well too many conflicts happening at once, and just not enough time for all of them. Best to lower your expectations before watching this!
B000Y179KO|1.0|WOW. This is what the Eagles came up with after 28 years!!  I used to bea huge Eagles fan, but this is one incredibly boring CD with only one catchy tune - that being the first release, How Long (which was written by JD Souther, not the Eagles).  The rest of the CD (it's a double CD but one would have been plenty of this @#$%$) is full of boring riffs, unremarkable musicianship, and OF COURSE, Don Henley's typical ranting and raving about how we're all mindless, greedy idiots totally sucked up in the consumerism of the USA.  You're right Don - I shouldn't have wasted $12 by putting it in your rich pockets.  One positive note - nice harmonies when they decide to incorporate them on the rare occassion.  I'm sure the CD will be successful, but man, is it a poor excuse for a once very talented band.  I'm going to trade this one into CD Warehouse.

0312330537|5.0|If you want to go into the heart of a city like London as depicted by Dickens, then Shantaram is the novel for you. Modern Bombay seems to be in a time warp that keeps it always in the middle ages. You find so much about Bombay that it's as if you've walked all its mean streets, and talked with its remarkable inhabitants. The novel is filled with interesting characters  and conversations, including philosophical debates about metaphysics and love. There is a beautiful evocation of travel to a village in the north of India. There is plenty of action and a deeply moving romance. One feels from the beginning that there will be a tragic twist in the love story of Shantaram, a man on the run from the Australian police, and Karla, a beautiful French woman. A few more novels such as Shantaram and the author, Australian Gregory David Roberts, will be up for the Nobel Prize in literature.

B000000W5F|4.0|Because the band planned another huge world tour in 1981-1982, The Rolling Stones needed a new album to promote due to the relative weakness of the previous year's 'Emotional Rescue'. With little time to write and record, the Stones caught lightning in a bottle by cleaning up several outtakes from the last decade and releasing eleven songs on a unsuspecting public as 'Tattoo You' in late summer of '81. The album proved to be smash hit despite the fact that it was a fluke of sorts. Why weren't any of these songs on some of the more maligned albums of the 70's? I happen to think a song like \\"Worried About You\\" is just as good if not better than five songs on 'Black and Blue', the record for which it was originally recorded. \\"Tops\\" was supposed to make 'Goats Head Soup' but maybe the original was not up to par (I love 'Goats' anyway!) On 'Tattoo', \\"Tops\\" is one of the real quality tracks and it featured the unmistakable lead guitar of Mick Taylor (who had to sue to get royalties). The 'Emotional Rescue' outtakes are all much better than any song on that album ('cept for She's So Cold!). \\"Hang Fire\\", \\"Little T&A\\" and \\"Black Limosines\\" are all damn good latter day Stones tunes. \\"Start Me Up\\" definitley deserves its reputation as a modern day classic and was originally meant for 'Some Girls' (what an embarrassment of riches those recording sessions produced!). Many consider 'Tattoo' to be the last classic album the Stones made (I say it was 'Some Girls') but the point is debatable. One thing is for damn sure, \\"Waiting on a Friend\\" is an awesome song being that it is about friendship, pure and simple. \\"Friend\\" along with \\"Neighbors\\" (a great Stonesy rocker) and \\"Heaven\\" were the only newbies. I guess depending on your point of view, the Stones were either in a song-writing decline or they should have had outside producers to avoid the delay of so many great songs! The bottom line is the songs did receive release and many fans were happy with the finished result...ain't nouse in cryin'.
0143038583|5.0|Let me preface this review with a few facts -- I was not a vegetarian before I read this book and am not after reading it.  This book is not a polemic against meat eaters or an homage to vegetarians.  It is a book that thoughtfully tries to explore where our food comes from and the how it makes its way to our table.  It is informative, funny, revealing, frustrating and enlightening.  I read a lot of literature and non-fiction, but not much about food.  I certainly did not expect to be this captivated by a book about food.  Wow, this was the best book of the 30 I have read this year.  I could not put this book down and when I was not reading it, I was thinking about it and the subject matter.<br /><br />Michael Pollan has written a well-balanced book that is not hysterical, does little finger pointing and refrains from passing value judgements.  Anyone who is interested in being more aware of the food that they eat must read this book.  It may not change your eating habits, but it will certainly enlighten you about what you eat.
1932100660|5.0|I recently closed my medical practice of 21 years to spend more time acquiring knowledge about alternative medicine and nutrition in the US. Dr Campbell's scientific observations line up perfectly with my clinical observations. I appreciate his work. One of the solutions I have turned to is juiceplus. i promote it's use thru my website [...] . I am also learning to rely on a plant based diet. Based on what i have observed thru the years, I would treat my own cancer with botanical remedies and not chemotherapy or radiation. This material supports my decision.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|Ok I'll hit you with the bad news first.  1.  This band is not metal!  when your main influence is Guns N Roses that doesn't make you metal.  2.  Some of the worst singing I've ever heard in my life.  I'm not into the whole clean vocal thing but jesus if you are going to sing make sure you can sing.  It's like taking the most monotone tone deaf person in the world making him hold his nose and giving him a microphone! 3.  The guitar playing is good but it's not great because i feel like they aren't used to the fullest extent of their abilities.  Now the good 1.  The guitar playing that's about it.  If you are into hard rock i reccomend you dowload beast and the harlot, trashed and scattered, and seize the day but don't waste your money on the whole cd because the rest of it is complete crap.  BTW I heard a sample of these guys covering walk by pantera (one of my favorite songs) and they completely butchered it.  Dimebag Darrell is rolling over in his grave.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Anybody who loves this show knows I don't have to write a review.  This is one of the best sci-fi shows I have ever seen.  I'm not even close to being a fan of sci-fi...heck I don't even like Star Wars, but Firefly is AWESOME!  Such amazing actors and great character development.  So simple with the cinematography, but original and gave it a special taste.  Figures that they'd take it off the air...
B000F7CMRM|5.0|Syriana was more than I expected. I was speaking with my doctor during one of my visits with him, and he asked me if I had seen the movie Syriana. At the time I had not seen the movie, but it was on my mind for several months, when I finally decided to see if it was available, and it was. The movie surprised me. Although it was fictional it does fit in with the times we are living in now, with big oil, and Corporate America's stanglehold on our government. We are no longer a country governed for the people by the people. We are governend by big government, big oil, and big pharmacology, and Corporate America.    I related very well with Syriana, and the similarities, which are occurring now within our government. Scandals, behind closed doors illegal legislation, the NSA spy program, and human rights violations, and torture. President Bush may say we do not torture, but any thinking individual knows this is not true.    Syriana scared the hell out of me, and the Bush Administration also scares the hell out of me...    I recommend Syriana for anyone who is interested in politics and the \\"dirty tricks\\" that go on in secret. An excellent movie to say the least.
B000002AGN|4.0|I finally broke down and picked up this CD to replace my two vinyl LPs (monaural and stereo).  Whether due to age, dust, a fading cartridge and stylus, I was getting distortion from Joe Morello's cymbals.  So I've received this latest deluxe version trumpeting its advanced technology and audio--but where are the cymbals?  And on a recording where time and percussion deserve top billing!  The first thing noticeable on the opening track is the near-inaudibility of the ride cymbal (it becomes louder by the end of the track).<br /><br />In short, this is not the greatest transcription--not even close.  Desmond's alto is full, silky, and very present, and the bass, as usual on recordings these days, is certainly adequate (thankfully not over-cranked).  The piano sound, on the other hand, is \\"cramped and narrow,\\" lacking the rich Steinway sonorities of the vinyl original.  And even as I've got my treble control turned all the way up, Morello's percussion--brush work and especially cymbals--is simply weak and distant in the mix.  Shame on the Sony-Columbia engineers (especially after their glorious transcription of \\"Duke Ellington at Newport 1956\\"--perhaps the best-ever transfer of a vinyl recording to digital).<br /><br />Besides the introduction of unconventional time signatures to jazz, \\"Time Out\\" was the beginning of the Brubeck Quartet's many studio albums.  All you have to do is go back to some of their earlier, \\"live\\" concert dates on Fantasy and Columbia to realize that \\"Time Out\\" is actually a relatively \\"conservative,\\" uninspired recording, as is true of most of the Brubeck studio sessions.  (As for those reviewers who call this the best Brubeck recording or, for that matter, best jazz recording of all time, I almost envy them: imagine their ecstatic response when they get around to listening to \\"Kind of Blue.\\")
B000EWBKKI|3.0|As the title says, the picture is as good as it can be (considering the film that it was recorded on) and that picture is better then dvd. The only problem i have with this is there is no UncompressedPCM track.. like whats going on?? Im pretty sure all my Blu-Rays have UncompressedPCM (i havent gone through them all though)   regardless though the DTS track is nice but still not what i expect from a Blu-Ray release.  Great for fans and if you don't have the DVD (which i didnt)
B000P2A24W|4.0|This cd stayed in my car player for a couple of weeks, before I could bring myself to change it out.  'Make a Memory' is an incredibly beautiful song and sentiment, with a message about hope for a previously lost love. Being a LeAnn Rimes fan, I love the duet 'Til We Ain't Strangers Anymore'. 'Everybody's Broken' is both sad and encouraging at the same time. Bon Jovi has the ability to write songs that, if really listened to, can touch the hearts of many people. I would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys Bon Jovi and listens to the words of songs.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This film, released in 2003, is a wonderful holiday picture. Will Ferrell stars as Buddy the Elf, who crawls into Santa Claus' (Ed Asner) bag at an orphanage and winds up at the North Pole where he is adopted by Papa Elf (played by Bob Newhart). It is soon realized that Buddy is not a true elf, but a human raised by elves. After finding out his true parentage, a Walter Hobbs (played by James Caan) he journeys to New York City to meet and reconcile with his biological father. With his innocent nature he has several misadventures, more particularly at Gimbel's, where he is mistaken for an elf worker and put to work at the \\"North Pole\\" and meets a worker named Jovie (played by Zooey Deschanel) who he is enchanted by and falls in love with. He then goes to his father's apartment, meeting his half-mother (Mary Steenburgen) and his half-brother. He stays there until he is taken to work by Walter, where he gets drunk for the first time. He then has many adventures along the way, including running away from home until he meets Santa who has crash-landed in Central Park. I will not give away too much more, but it is a satisfying conclusion, including a spoof of a well-known cryptozoological piece of footage. I give Elf 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|This movie was if I am totally honest not worth the hype, however despite this, it did have its moments, the special effects were amazing and the plot was intriguing if a little disjointed.<br /><br />The cast were good despite none being what I would call \\"big stars\\" I think this was what stopped it from being a total flop because they did their best and it was them and the special effects that made it reasonably worthwhile.<br /><br />Take one big space ship setting out on a cosmic journey to send out a \\"payload\\" ( a large and special kind of bomb)  to kick start our dying sun.  On board you have scientists and engineers all of them with different specialities and all of them aware of the importance of their mission.<br /><br />The last mission that was sent out seven years ago failed though no one knows why, that is until a distress signal is picked up and the missing space ship is located and a fateful decision is made by one of the crew members.<br /><br />And this is where the mission starts to go disastrously wrong, we have some accidental deaths followed by a suicide and then the murders start and it soon becomes clear to one of the scientists that not everyone on the derelict ship from the failed mission might be dead and it's a race against time to get the \\"Payload\\" sent off into the sun before a mad man ends all hope for humanity.<br /><br />There is no happy ending in this film, but then if there was I think that would have made it VERY cheesy, as it was, it managed to chug along to a solid conclusion if nothing else.<br /><br />Worth watching on DVD if you have nothing else on offer.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|The exception would be \\"The Complete Recordings of Lawrence of Arabia\\"......the recordings that are available only offer snippets of this masterpiece of cinematic music.

B000N6TX22|5.0|I had to write a short review after seeing all the negative reviews posted here. It's a sad state of affairs when people find this to be a poor movie yet something like Spiderman 3 or Wild Hogs makes billions. This is one of the most beautifully shot movies you will ever see. Clive Owen is amazing, the story is tension filled. I'm wondering if some of the reviewers even watched the movie because it isn't slow moving in any facet, it's non stop action once it starts from beginning to end. The story is haunting, and a downer which will turn some people off, but this is GREAT moviemaking. If you don't get it, just stick with your Shrek 3's and you'll be all right.

B000002GHH|5.0|Hiatt never sounded more gut-wrenchingly 'authentic' than on this very touching work. I recall a small documentary on his that came out at about to coincide with its launch, and if the recall is accurate, I think it was none less than John Lee Hooker who confides that when he first heard Hiatt on record, he and friends thought it was a black guy. That's some testimony to the conviction Hiatt brings to his rootsy-styles singing and playing.'Have a Little Faith in Me' has recently been re-recorded by someone who is getting current airplay, a disembowelling of it's originator's intention. It is from this point of the collection of 'Family ' songs that the big end of his muse lights up; a wonderful record for all time.

B000VECAEO|4.0|Ok. It's a known fact that the tone of the series changed dramatically when Larry David left. The eight and ninth seasons of Seinfeld are really different from the others. In the first seven seasons, there was at least a little bit (very little bit) of genuine comradeship and affection between the maisn characters. After that, they become the real selfish and greed guys they became known for...<br /><br />Season Nine is good, but by any standards is far from great. (mainly when you compare it with the show's own very high standards!).There are uneven episodes, but none of them is bad by itself, and the show was far from jumping the shark. Maybe to avoid this at all costs was the reason why Jerry Seinfeld decided to call it a day (this, plus the fact that he was extremely tired from working on the show non-stop all that years - and the last two without support from David).<br /><br />As for the final episode, I tought it was very good and absurd like the show itself. As lawyer Jack Chiles says in his opening statement to the jury, the absurd of the trial is that the criminal itself (the guy who robbed the fat guy) is free and people's taxes are being thrown away trying to convict the four guys who did not help, based on some silly Good Samaritan law! This concept itself was very funny. OFfcourse, it's very rare to see a sitcom end with the four main characters being in jail!!  But, hey, it was for \\"only\\" one year... :)
0525950079|5.0|If anyone has seen my review on Pillars of the Earth, then it should be clear that I was so looking forward to this book. I am most certainly glad that I bought it and read it in a matter of weeks.  I did not read this one as fast as \\"Pillars\\" but still I read this one quickly for the number of pages in the book.    This book again raised my emotional levels. There were some characters that I really liked and some that I really hated.  However, Mr. Follett knows how to raise those kind of emotions.  This really revolves around two areas in the book: the hatred of Ralph and the love between Merthin and Caris.  Again, evil (Ralph) and good (Merthin and Caris) are the \\"Pillars\\" of this world.  During the story, it appeared that Merthin and Caris never got a break but Ralph always got the breaks.  This is because Ralph does what he needed to to get what he wanted - including killing.      This book has something happen in almost every chapter.  It keeps moving and keeps the reader guessing as to what is going to happen.  Just when it looked like Caris and Merthin were going to get married, she is accused of witchcraft.  The prior was willing to do anything than accept change for the good.  Ralph was willing to do anything to get what he wanted most in the world: power.      I have read the reivews regarding the amount of sex in the book.  While there is much of it, I did not find it overly so since much of that took place back in this period of time.  The parts about the gay bishop or the lesbian affair between Caris and Mair was not over the top in my estimation.  As regards to Caris, she had lost the man she loved and was trapped in a world that she did not like to begin with. I did not find it unrealistic to think that she might turn to another nun for comfort and love.  The other parts in the book about sex had to do with Gwenda and Ralph which was necessary to build up the hatred for Ralph.      With all that being said, I did not like this book as much as \\"Pillars\\" but that may be due to the fact that I believe the sequels are almost never as good as the original.     This book also makes a very loud statement on how events early in life can have such an affect on events later in life.  Or how the events early in life can shead light on how the person really is on the inside.  For instance, when Ralph kills Gwenda's dog in the very beginning of the book, it is apparent that Ralph is a bad kid and will grow up to be a bad guy.  It clearly shows that the events in life are not mutually exclusive but entangle people's lives together for better or worse.    Overall, this was a very good book.
B000QUCNP4|4.0|***1/2 2007. Directed by David Fincher and inspired by Robert Graysmith's [[ASIN:0425212181 Zodiac]]. More a psychological study of the men who worked on this case than a regular serial killer movie. That's maybe why the movie works pretty well and deserves your attention.
B0002TKFGI|5.0|When I was choosing this recording, I decided to listen to other transfers of this disc, and there have been many. I first listened to this on the Living Stereo release at my local public library probably 25 years ago. Perhaps that colored my future perceptions of this recording: the library used to clean their recordings with WATER, of all things. So there was much surface noise. The performance shined, though. As the years wore on, RCA decided to release this on what they called the \\"5.0\\" series where they remastered their classic recordings with new technology (sound familiar?). I owned this version for many years, but I listened to it on my turntable 3 years ago and was really disapponted-mostly things seemed over-modulated and distorted. 2 or 3 different CD releases of this recording seemed to be cut from the same cloth. Then I heard this SACD release and I was floored. It seemed that the original master tape was discovered in Japan! So most of these releases were not cut from the original master tape! I own many of these SACD's and are generally very pleased with the new remasterings. I really don't know why people are so gung-ho about the original LP's as I have tried this by spending 20-30 dollars on Living Stereo LPs from Ebay and putting the needle on my record and immediately hearing surface noise. If you decide not to take the plunge on this recording, my other favorites in this wonderful symphony include Barenboim/CSO on DG, Ansermet/Suisse Romande on Decca, with casual nods to Eschenbach/Philadelphia on Ondine and Mata/Dallas on Dorian which both have interpretive issues. I do prefer the analog recordings of this work to the digital ones.
1932907009|5.0|I've taken three month-long screenwriting seminars, one at USC, and read countless other books on the craft.

B000002UAO|5.0|OK, I came of age in the mid-60's and the Beatles' music was an integral part of that time in my life. Their album \\"Rubber Soul\\" marked the emergence of their evolution as serious musician/songwriters. This was not the usual Beatles sound (i.e. \\"She Loves You\\" or \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\"). For serious Beatles fans of the time most of us will remember exactly where and when we listened to this album for the first time. This was an edgier album from what we had been used to from these four. It's hard to imagine that there is anyone not familiar with this particular album/CD, but for someone seriously interested in the music of that radically changing time in music this album/CD is a must.
B000YABYLA|5.0|At 16 Juno MacGuff is into 70s Punk Rock and Slasher films; she lives with her Dad, Stepmom and half-sister; she is a junior in high school; oh, and she's pregnant. Juno tells the story of the girl by the same name as she faces the choice of how to handle her situation. She is not married to, or even dating the baby's father. She is, as already mentioned, only 16 years old. She makes an interesting decision and the movie goes from there.     Rarely will I address the soundtrack or the casting of a movie. I normally tune out the music (sorry for the pun) and will address only individual casting decisions. I have no choice but to talk about both here.     Music is one of the comforting, yet (at times) conflict-inspiring, elements in Juno. With it being so important to characters, it is only appropriate that more attention be given to the soundtrack. The music was not ambient noise; it was used almost as a narrative technique and also to ease transitions between scenes. Music played a key role in the film and was used perfectly throughout.    I cannot remember the last movie I saw where there was not a person out of place. Each person who participated in Juno seemed perfect for his or her role.     Ellen Page (Juno) showed a lot of versatility as the movie's title character. She was always in control of the role, even when it meant playing someone so conflicted. Juno was strong, but vulnerable. She was smart, but ignorant. She was mature, but too young to know any better. Her personality was abrasive, which was not eased with the amount of slang that she piled on to every conversation early in the movie. But that changed. As the movie went on, Juno did what 16-year-old girls do: she grew up.     I had not experienced the \\"magic\\" of Michael Cera until Juno. He has received such an incredible amount of praise from his role on \\"Arrested Development\\" and his part in Superbad, but I never watched the former and he did not impress me in the latter. But in Juno he was perfect. However, I sure hope I am not the first person to point out the stark similarity in his performances. Beware the typecast Michael, even though it is probably too late.    Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner deserve some praise for selling their parts so well. And while everyone was so good, one person rose above the rest: J.K. Simmons, who played Juno's father. He was a lot of the movie's comedic relief, but that was such a special character for what his relationship meant to Juno. My appreciation wasn't entirely for the part, J.K. seemed to bring something extra to the it. His performance was one of my favorites of the year.     From my -- however limited -- experience, Juno was an original story with a unique perspective on one pregnant teen. The story flirted with \\"afternoon special,\\" but never went over the edge. Any scene which could have led to sappy cliché was immediately steered clear, usually with humor. While I would not classify Juno as a \\"comedy,\\" it definitely had some of the most genuinely funny dialogue I have heard. As the credits roll you will find that Juno was a story you would not normally snuggle up to, but preconceived notions be damned! Both touching and funny, Juno was a very good movie.

B00000I8BX|5.0|I have always said that heavy synthesizer could work within the confines of metal, and belatedly I investigated Fear Factory and found I was right.  Their second album \\"Demanufacture\\", which now comes with \\"Remanufacture\\", the remix album, is considered a cornerstone work.  \\"Obsolete\\" carries the vibe of \\"Demanufacture\\" and adds some surprises, mainly a faithful cover of Gary Numan's \\"Cars\\" and a downright pretty song, \\"Timelessness\\", which is haunting and touching.  Hooray for Fear Factory for breaking the rules.<br />  The rest of the CD is classic FF, with Dez' guitars hammering away with the subtlety of a jackhammer on your forehead and Burton Bell's amazing vocal capabilities, from a gutteral roar to downright melodic.  His is probably one of the most powerful voices in rock today.<br />  \\"Obsolete\\" could easily be timely and still just as heavy 100 years from now, along with Voivod, another great futuristic metal band.
0374105235|3.0|The first part of this book is just plain dull. So bad and so boring that I almost stopped reading the book.  Basically, the main character is happy, goes to a village, almost dies, is saved, rinse - repeat.  Half the book is like this, and it was nearly unreadable.    However, once you hit page 100, the real stuff starts.  He details his descent into an inhuman soldier with no empathy and no regret.  It's both vicious and honest and truly frightening.  Some of the best stuff I have ever read.    Unfortunately, after about 30 pages, he's not a soldier anymore.  A mere thirty pages of being a child soldier seems to be false advertising.  I was annoyed.  However, the last 80 or so pages describe his \\"recovery\\", his reunion with his new family, and his quest to teach others - and it wasn't that bad.    At some points, this book is beyond amazing, but the dull parts make it a mere average autobiography.

B000OVLBF8|2.0|Nicholas Cage plays a motorcycle stunt rider named Johnny Blaze, who as a teenager makes a deal with the Devil to save his father's life. In the ensuing years he does more and more dangerous stunts because he knows he can't die. One day the Devil comes back to collect on the deal, forcing Cage to become the Ghost Rider, collecting the souls of evil men. The Devil's son Blackheart also shows up, opposing his father, catching Ghost Rider in the middle of the fight. Sam Elliott plays a previous Ghost Rider from a century and a half ago who helps Cage understand what is going on.    The plot was promising but Ghost Rider bored me. The performances were all right but the script wasn't very well written and the entire story failed to grab me. The effects were the real star of the movie and that's a problem. The effects were cool most of the time but they can't make up for the movies' flaws, the biggest of which was they didn't make me care about the characters and what happened to them.

The only minor complaints I had were during \\"Cry Me A River\\"(should have had a drum/percussion intro) and at one point JT's pants were wet at the kneecaps and I coudn't figure out how they got that way. Odd, yes I know. Other than that, buy it and crank it up!
B00065MDS6|4.0|Luis Mejia (son) - King Crimson's ever fluctuating line-up had led the group onto 1971 to retain only two original members; guitarist Robert Fripp and lyricist and drawer Peter Sinfield, with the addition of the legendary Mel Collins in saxes and flute (who seems to have played every progressive rock piece with flute or saxophone!), drummer Andy McCulloch and vocalist and bassist Gordon Haskell. After their \\"uncanny masterpiece\\" of In The Court Of The Crimson King and the explosive and serene In The Wake Of Poseidon, many may had critisized Lizard as an acquired taste, although the album is nothing like this. Lizard is a strongly jazz inflicted album, with a medieval aura surrounding every piece, which Gordon Haskell's raspy and deep-edged voice fits perfectly, and a quirky sense of humor; many characteristics can be seen in their previous album but Lizard differs in aspects like the themes and atmospheres, the strong jazz orientation (a key aspect into comparing jazz and prog), and musical details like Robert Fripp dextrous acoustic guitar, Keith Tippet collaborating piano and VCS3, and the introduction of a whole series of woodwind instruments. Although this lineup never toured (as Haskell and McCulloch left the band quickly), Circus became a concert favourite, and it is a very imaginative song about circus imagery, the song reflects mystery and very dark but calm atmospheres, while Happy Family is certainly the most humorous song in the album, a quirky piece but an emotive one with their recognizeable \\"madness\\", Lady Of The Dancing Water is the most gorgeous song on the album, second to Cadence And Cascade throughout their career, beautiful melodies while not too much of a romantic piece, it displays an extraordinary poetic scenary. The title track Lizard is the longest piece the group ever recorded, piecking at 23 minutes overall, but its one of my favourites; it doesn't show those worst excesses that certain progressive rock songs may show, I may be a fan of very long songs but I can recognize when a song is enjoyable or not, its surely the best song in the album; having Jon Anderson from Yes in the first part of the vocal duties (as Hakell couldn't reach those notes!), the song displays a super potent jazz interest, mixed with the album's whole aura, it gets enjoyable in jazz prospectives but also for progressive rock searchers, it features a heavy use of mellotron, an extensive and obscure woodwind section, and, although the chorus may sound poppy, it get darker and serious throughout the last parts, specially when Haskell starts his vocal duties. Not a masterpiece of progressive rock (thats why 4 stars), and including factors like the band's tension and the lineup that never toured reduce little positive aspects, but surely one of their quirkiest (quirkiest, not experimental or agressive) and pure albums, with a perfect medieval aura, the best lyrics Peter Sinfield ever wrote, and a fantastic sound; I can even recommend it for casual listeners. This remastered version sounds incredible, every instrument is heard perfectly and loud, and it doesn't contain bonus tracks.ery long songs but I can recognize when a song is enjoyable or not, its surely the best song in the album; having Jon Anderson from Yes in the first part of the vocal duties (as Hakell couldn't reach those notes!), the song displays a super potent jazz interest, mixed with the album's whole aura, it gets enjoyable in jazz prospectives but also for progressive rock searchers, it features a heavy use of mellotron, an extensive and obscure woodwind section, and, although the chorus may sound poppy, it get darker and serious throughout the last parts, specially when Haskell starts his vocal duties.

B000WTBMBK|5.0|The council houses in London possess an aura that is easier to feel than it is to explain. Often covered in fresh tile and paint and given attractive names, they contain many of the city's former criminals, violent children and sexual deviants. I used to jog at midnight and come upon the council houses, always devoid of life from the outside, yet teeming with rotten things behind its clean façade. Every night I would return to them, both repelled and magnetized by their unnerving paradox of innocuousness and evil, letting the ghostly atmosphere of the council houses take me over in some puzzling, profound way.<br /><br />Whether he knows it or not, anonymous London producer Burial makes music sound like council houses feel. His eponymous debut in 2006 capitalized on the eerie sensation of London at night by taking the rhythmic patterns and instrumentation of dubstep, a chiefly British genre, and blackening the palette. The drums sounded like knives hitting steel; the record crackles evoked raindrops; the bass was so low that it seemed to operate at subsonic frequencies. Every so often, a voice would make its strangled way up the surface, crying for everyone in London who wanted out before trailing off into the unforgiving cityscape.<br /><br />As a dubstep album, Burial did double duty by raising the bar and providing a solid introduction to neophytes, but it faltered whenever it moved too close to standard dubstep skank for comfort. Untrue--Burial's sophomore effort and masterpiece-- jettisons everything that kept his last record from being a truly immersive experience, ratchets up the emotionality, and comes bathed in an unearthly, ineffable glow. In an interview with Hyperdub Records, Burial speaks of conceiving Untrue in the dead of night with the television murmuring and getting lost in the music as he made it. Indeed, Untrue is rooted in time and place (don't try listening to this in the afternoon), but amorphous enough to invite the kind of fascinated exploration that kept me coming back to the council houses time and time again.<br /><br />It's a good thing that Burial stuck to one concept on Untrue, because what a concept it is. The music retains Burial's bleakness and trademark dubstep rhythms, but every track now contains disembodied R&B vocals similar to those you heard on MTV in the 1990`s--think Keith Sweat, Faith Evans, or any diva or crooner who made a killing singing the same garbage over and over. Stripped of their original context, though, these vocal fragments take on a powerfully yearning quality, whose diction may be smeared into indecipherability but whose meaning is clear and true. It is as though all of the vapid, shallow soul music of the previous decade has come back to haunt us in our dreams.<br /><br />In fact, yearning is the prevailing emotion on Untrue. I'm reminded of Jonathan Safran Foer's short story, A Primer for the Punctuation of Heart Disease, in which he outlined punctuation marks to be used when words will not suffice. The mark that defines Untrue is the ellipsis, or for Foer, the pedal point (~), \\"indicating dissolution into suggestive silence.\\" These songs feel like an outstretched hand, an attempt at communication that may be reciprocated or may fall unheeded into dead space. The bass drums seem to knock on something loose and wobbly, bringing to mind a jilted lover banging his palm on the steering wheel; the snare drums hit the counterpoints and then hang there with nothing else to fill the void. Sometimes the beats drop out altogether, as on \\"Endorphin,\\" when Burial lets only a child's cry and a heart-busting ambient melody take us where we need to go.<br /><br />Where we go on Untrue is someplace we only think we've been before. Trip-hop is the closest reference point, but Untrue is its own beast--a half-familiar dream with half-familiar elements. \\"Near Dark\\"s lame loverman refrain, \\"I can't take my eyes off you,\\" is uncharacteristically despondent. The slow, undulating texturesand diva vocals of \\"Ghost Hardware\\" may nod to mid-career Massive Attack, yet they're undercut by chattering rhythms that suggest a state of panic. Often, Burial beats Massive Attack at their own darkly evocative game: \\"In McDonalds\\" finds him painting a solemn picture of what it's like to eat at McDonalds during the graveyard shift, looking at the flickering fluorescents and the limp burger in front of you. He nailed it.<br /><br />Burial claims that his desire to remain anonymous has to do with keeping his music separate from his personal life. So perhaps he's perfectly content to stay in the shadows for as long as it takes, yet Untrue bears the unmistakable mark of an artist struggling to connect. The young man on the cover... Is that Burial himself? What is he thinking? In \\"Archangel,\\" the vocalist repeats, \\"If I trust you...\\" to no reply. On Untrue, Burial offers this conditional to us, reluctantly reaching out in the hope that someone will be listening on the other end.nod to mid-career Massive Attack, yet they're undercut by chattering rhythms that suggest a state of panic.

B000R7HY0K|3.0|Quentin Tarantino's `5th' film Death Proof was originally conceived as the second part of a `Grindhouse' double bill with Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror. The idea was to replicate the 70's exploitation movie experience of low budget shclock opera's, where the posters are better than the actual films, and which have clearly been such a huge influence on both filmmakers - missing reels, scratched celluloid, gate hairs, tacky trailers and kitsch corporate graphics all to an ear splitting trumpet-loaded soundtrack. It certainly took me back to the pre-multiplex days of my childhood when audiences had enough of an attention span to watch two films back to back with barely a moment in between to restock on Embassy No10's and another carton of Kia-Ora.<br /><br /> I saw the original Grindhouse `double bill' version in New York back in April, and appreciated it for the great bit of self indulgence it is on the part of the directors who should be in the happy position of being able to make the movies they want without having to worry too much about box office returns and studio interference. Unfortunately somewhere in the crossfire of a Mexican standoff between the producers, marketing department, distributors and the directors themselves Grindhouse has been mutilated, Black Dahlia-like, and unceremoniously dumped in two halves on U.K audiences. Although reviews were good, Grindhouse flopped in the states, so, with what appears to be a case of contagious cold feet tippy-toeing their way across the Atlantic, our distributors have decided that we're incapable of handling the Grindhouse experience in its entirety - hence releasing Tarantino's half as his 5th film.<br /><br />Death Proof is an intentionally slight tale of psychopathic `Stuntman Mike' (Kurt Russell) who gets his kicks causing car crashes in his specially designed `death proof' Chevy Nova (and later a Dodge Charger) in which everyone except himself is killed. After targeting yet another group of nubile young girls as his next victims the tables are turned and Stuntman Mike becomes the subject of their bloody revenge.<br /><br />  Considering the promise of mucho car-nage that the premise suggests Death Proof is dialogue heavy; but then one line of Tarantino's dialogue is more action packed than all of Diesel, Seagal and Van Damme's `roid' fests put together - and when the violence does descend, it falls hard. But isolated from the Grindhouse concept, Death Proof pales besides the likes of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. A 127 minute re-cut of the movie was shown at the Cannes Film Festival last May in an attempt to bring it up to the standard of Tarantino's other outings and this, I believe, is the version U.K audiences are about to witness.<br /><br /> Unfortunately the faux-trailers of `forthcoming attractions' such as Machete, Hobo with a Shotgun and Werewolf Women of the S.S (with Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu!) which split the original Grindhouse version are not included. This sequence was the highlight of the whole movie and I know I'm not the only one who hoped that they would actually turn some of these spoofs into real films. It's looking doubtful that the original Grindhouse double bill version will be shown in the U.K and even more annoying that the DVD releases of both films are not to feature the trailers either. (Apart from Machete in Planet Terror) Death proof is one thing - but film industry proof?

I say all this first so you can understand that I am not just a casual fan of the genre.     I bought \\"World war Z\\" with high expectations, based on the reviews I was hearing, but it didn't deliver what I expected. It is indeed a well written book, with bits of action here and there, but it lacks the one thing that makes zombie books/movies/games great, character development. The book is short stories of survivors, so you really never get a chance to fall in love with some, hate some, and just get downright amused with some!    Where the book is good lies in the detailed accounts of how certain governments would deal with a zombie breakout. So I gave it 3 stars, mainly for effort.     Brody

B000WTZ784|5.0|I just ordered this CD/DVD from Amazon and I'm really looking forward to hearing it in 5.1 and seeing the video content, because to me, this is one of Genesis best recordings. Sadly American audiences could not see it. I suppose it was because they were so mentally conditioned to Phil Collins vocal. I always felt that after the 1983 album \\"Genesis\\" which included \\"Mama\\" , \\"Home By The Sea\\" etc. was the last great Genesis album before the \\"Invisible Touch\\" album pushed them into mainstream extremes. After that time the band basically became the \\"Phil Collins and his band Genesis\\" show. I saw Genesis on tour the first time back in 1976 when they had recruited Bill Bruford as their first second drummer and they still had the incredible Mr. Steve Hackett on guitar. That was an incredible show and probably the best show I've ever seen with maybe the exception of the \\"Wind And Wuthering\\" tour. There has never been a show that matched the excitement and amazement of those shows. And I've seen many, many, shows over my years. I always preferred the more progressive, somewhat darker side of Genesis and when Ray Wilson came into the band his voice was a perfect match for a return to that side of Genesis - sounding very similar to Peter Gabriel and equally capablel of passionately singing Phil Collins spots as well. It was a perfect choice and the band was excited about the change, but sadly they soon realized that  people refused to give it a chance without old Phil. On the bright side, since that time I have become a very big fan of Ray Wilson's solo work and his work with Stiltskin, RWPL, etc. He is an intelligent songwriter and incredible vocalist and I have enjoyed his work very, very much. But to me this one unique Genesis CD will always be one of my favorites, right up there with Selling England, The Lamb, Trick Of The Tail, and Wind And Wuthering. I am constantly amazed at how people fail to recognize such great art. Even though Genesis reunited this year for another greatest hits tour (and the ticket prices were extreme) I've grown bored  with more continuous rehashing the hits (even though it is good to hear Chester Thompson bashing away again). Try \\"Calling All Stations\\" and experience the true Genesis genuis at work.reatest hits tour (and the ticket prices were extreme) I've grown bored  with more continuous rehashing the hits (even though it is good to hear Chester Thompson bashing away again).

B00003CXUM|4.0|Every metaphor is in Wong Kar-Wai's amazing directing and coloring. To<br />which, successfully evolves a flummoxing emotions between Maggie and<br />Tony to audiences. There are several significant scenes I like:<br /><br />Scene 1: A kind of relationship reveals when Maggie's husband only<br />vocally appears in the movie. Maggie's gently scratch over her leg<br />after her husband gets up for a change hints prior sex. During this<br />time, the scene was viewed through a door seam that leads a<br />restraining,or suppressing atmosphere. Later on, the director also uses<br />this technique taking the eyes of camera through windows, fences, veils,<br />etc.<br /><br />Scene 2: the rice cooker. Gathering for meals is an important thing in<br />most oriental cultures. Maggie is often alone and lack of connection<br />with her husband while her friends' dinner scene provides a juxtapose.<br /><br />Scene 3: the clock, the rain (water), and diurnal eat-and-out suggest<br />the time. Time concedes a vastly recurring mise-en-scene.<br /><br />Scene 4: albeit the lack of his countenance, the smoke of cigarette<br />surrounding by Tony gives an invisible projection of his perplexing<br />thoughts.<br /><br />The whole scene: speak it all a conservative year back in 1962. No<br />strong physical affection back then, yet the intense love and<br />affection ferment deeply inside these two protagonists.<br /><br />It is a beautiful film and also a good study material for students in<br />film majors.

If they have a movie with a budget this big, and the fan base to support it, then write a decent script rather then trying to out-do Star Wars by using CGI for 99% of the movie and trying to add 1% plot around it.    The movie might well have gotten better after the first half hour, but I will never know because I can not stand the useless and terrible looking CGI with actors who don't cast any shadow or light from their surroundings.     Sometimes I can see past the bad CGI, but this one is just overkill, and was it really needed to tell anything in the story? The whole alley way surfboard scene just turned me off completely.

Stone is called by his old boss and nemesis Carter Gray to a meeting at a secluded mansion for a sit down of sorts. At the meeting, Gray informs Stone of the murders of his former compatriots and advises him to watch his own back. Shortly after the meeting, the mansion is destroyed by an explosion attributed to a gas leak. Carter Gray is killed. Stone is the prime suspect.    Annabelle Conroy, the con artist introduced in The Collectors, is still on the run from Jerry Bagger, the Atlantic City casino boss she fleeced out of $40 million dollars in the previous novel. She learns that one of her co-conspirators has been tracked down in Europe and brutally beaten. Annabelle knows his attackers now have her name and assumes correctly that the culprits are minions of Jerry Bagger.    All this takes place in the first few chapters of the book, which I must say is one of the best Baldacci novels in recent years. The disparate plots intermingle well and send both Stone and Conroy on collision course to fates they have constructed for themselves by actions taken long ago.    As could have been done in the Camel Club, we find out much more about the main protagonists of these stories in this book than we have known before. Character back-stories are filled in and reasons for the actions they have taken are now understandable.    This book is fast paced, a refreshing change to the previous two novels that plodded along and dragged us to inevitable climaxes, that were laid out too early in the story line. Stone Cold grips you and holds you, and springs many more surprises on you and tosses you an ending that will drop you to your knees.    Armchair Interviews says: Snuggle up in your favorite armchair with this one, but make sure you have plenty of wood for the fire. You will need it.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|All i can say is WOW, there new album has just blown me away. I bought this cd when it first hit the shelves and ive yet to put it down! As soon as the first track starts till the last track ends, your quick to learn the lyrics and they are easy to sing along to as well, which is what I love! You really can tell the love and commentment they've put into this new album. Incredable job Alter Bridge.    -greg-
B000V4NX04|5.0|When I first heard that \\"The Lives of Others\\" had beaten out \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" for the Oscar for best foreign film, I was surprised and disappointed because PL is a powerful and engaging film.  However, when I finally saw TLOO, I understood why it was chosen.  The only flaw is the extra 10 or 15 minutes added on after the climactic scene, which don't work as well as the rest of the movie.  But overall this is a deeply moving story about flawed human beings struggling to make their way forward in a profoundly repressive society.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|A music video of exceptional beauty that carries you emotionally through the breathtaking images of the planet earth and a variety of its creatures. Attenborough guides viewers through the world with a brief inroduction to some of the star creatures of the film. A must own for everyone's DVD collection.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Not a lot on here that hasn't been said already.  I will say, though, that there are not very many albums that I listen to anymore that I immediately like on first listen.  Illinoise was one I was already clapping to by the end of my first run-through.  Some terrific highs and lows, a few humdrum musical parts in between, but in the end these just add to the ambiance of the album.  And after repeated listens I still hold this album in very high regard.    On another note, watching Sufjan perform these songs in concert (with I believe it was a 13-piece band) was absolutely tremendous.  Definitely a worthwhile live show.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|A fun fantasy for all ages. This is a clean, family friendly, version of the classic story of Cinderella. It is well cast and there are some clever intersections with some real history (namely Leonardo Da Vinci and some of his real work). Though there is no fairy-god mother, there is magic just the same! I enjoyed it from beginning to end; in other words it was never boring, even starting out already knowing that the end would be a happily ever after! I highly recommend this for anyone's collection.
0838577016|5.0|This is a great book by any standard.  A massive amount of information in the vast field of neuroscience is covered in detail and synthesized in a coherent fashion.  In addition to Eric Kandel's pioneering laboratory research, this book is one of his great contributions to neuroscience, and of course many other scientists contributed to it, including James Schwartz and Thomas Jessell.  It's as good as the best textbooks I've read, such as Alberts' Molecular Biology of the Cell.  It covers up to date research, in addition to the history of the field.  Topics range from the molecular workings of the neuron all the way up to behavior.  It's not at all dumbed down, so someone seeking a \\"CliffsNotes\\" version of the field should look elsewhere.  I suppose, however, if someone just wants a summary of the field, he can simply read the subheadlines in each chapter.  The book is lengthy due to its detail, but the intelligent general reader should readily understand nearly all of it.  And in spite of its length it actually is concise in covering this broad range of subject matter.  Author of [[ASIN:1846940559 Adjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health]].
B0007PAMBK|3.0|CARNIVAL OF SOULS is one of the benchmark cult classics and needs no further recommendation from me.  I'm focusing this review on the actual DVD release from Legend Films.<br /><br />The computer-colour process (used to make B&W films more appealing for modern audiences) has come a long way in the last ten years or so.  Remember when it used to look like a toddler had run riot with crayons, with pastel shades, waxy fleshtones and strange grainy effects on faces?  All that is now thankfully a thing of the past.<br /><br />The colouring of CARNIVAL OF SOULS is just about as natural and understated as it possibly can be.  The colours are bright and realistic, and stay strong during tracking shots.  The overall print quality used by Legend Films for this release is crisp and defect-free (and I've seen some shocking Public Domain prints of this movie).  Also included is the original B&W version--thankfully.  Generally I don't approve of colouring old movies (the original directors and costume designers had a vision!), but some movies benefit more than others.<br /><br />The bonus audio commentary by \\"Mystery Science Theater\\"'s Mike Nelson is a real highpoint.  CARNIVAL OF SOULS fans should support this quality release.
0143038583|1.0|Why bother reading a book that begins with the premise that humans are omnivores? Many experts believe humans are herbivores-search Google, you'll find many qualified articles on the subject. There are no \\"dilemmas\\" for herbivores-eat whole, plant based foods. And live a very long, vigorous life. The science is clear-it's pop culture that's confused. Read The China Study or Diet for a New America.     The way to good health and a vastly improved environment could not be simpler or clearer:remember the four food groups; 5 servings of whole grains, 4 servings of veggies, 3 servings of fruit, 2 servings of legumes. Live long and prosper...and have great sex until your 90!
B000FIMG68|4.0|a slow start, with a good build and great end. Season 4 is taking way too long to start!
0670034711|4.0|I am thoroughly amused by all the negative reviewers who complain that the book was all about the author.  LOL!!!  My literary-challenged fellow citizens, that's why it's a memoir!  Who else is it supposed to be about?  In any case, I found it a delightful read and I fully support her self-centeredness, self-absorption and self-indulgence.  There are more than enough suffering, self-sacrificing women in the world. Good for her that she took the time to explore her inner landscape and so what that her problems weren't life threatening?  Would she be a more worthy subject if she were living in abject poverty or suffering great physical pain? I do think India dragged a bit, but only because it came after the volumptous indulgences of Italy.  And to the reviewer who was upset cause the book wasn't \\"Christian\\"...Why should it have been Christian?  There are many routes to prayer.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|This album definently sounds like it has elements from all of DT's previous albums, they just keep getting better and better and better.    Instead of talking about the album as a whole I'll break down each song.    1. In The Presence Of Enemies - a good opener    2. Forsaken - kinda reminds me something from SFM.    3. Constant Motion - first time I hear this song, I though was this Metallica? Awsome song!    4. Dark Eternal Night - The heaviest song DT did to date, And I love it. The begining sounds a little like something TOOL would do.    5. Repentance - I did a double take when I heard the middle of this song, It almost sounded like something that should have been on Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, its good if you listen to this song then immediatelly play Voices it just flows very nicely.    6. Prophets Of War - This is the only song that I hate from the album, it just isn't up to DT's standards.    7. Ministry Of Lost Souls - Definently the awsome, reminds me of stuff from 6DIF with a little bit of SFM mixed in. I actally would play this song and then play Home, another good combo.    8. Presence Of Enemies 2 - This song almost sounds like it could be the Hard Rock version of Phantom of the Opera, actually that is a project I would like to see DT do, I bet LaBrie could pull it off. It also kinda sounds like something Megadeth would do. Then toward the end where it has that nice Snyth spacey riff. I just love it defiently hear the RUSH in this song.     Awsome album. I just love DT, I'm definently gonna spend the $300 and buy the VIP backstage pass for their next Tour, I might even fly out to Austrailia to see their tour they have now.

0123694833|5.0|Prior to making this purchase, I had been borrowing a friend's soft cover edition of the book. The frequency with which I was using it not only made me feel bad about the wear and tear my friend's book was getting, but also convinced me I'd much rather own the hardcover version. The CD is nice because if you are reading a paper on your computer and you want to look up something, you don't have to go to the book... as long as you have the CD in your CD drive, I guess.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I am a new comer to the Nightwish nation. I first heard them last year 2006, and after hearing one song, I had to buy every CD they had.<br /><br />The new singer is great. Different than the old one, but still great. It's like Sabbath with Ozzy and Sabbath with Dio. That's how I compare new and old Nightwish.<br /><br />Dark Passion Play may be the best CD I own. It immediately shot up my personal album chart along side of, do I dare say, Rush 2112. That's how much I like this album from Nightwish. I saw them on tour in October 2007, and they were awesome live too.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|OK so this edition is not on sale yet but 'Blade Runner' is, in my opinion, simply the greatest sci-fi movie ever made. Five discs? Heavenly! I look forward to my HD DVD five discer arriving in december. This is a must own/buy movie, u will not be disappointed.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I pre-ordered this item for my mother.  She saw it in the theater when it first came out, and wanted a copy for herself.  She just loves Michael Moore's outlook on our government, as she has many of the same views.  Her friend told her that a local department store carried the item, but my mother got hers delivered right to her door.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|I was SO skeptical about this one, mostly because of the PG-13 rating.  So, I didn't see it in theaters and heard from everyone how good it was.  When the unrated DVD came out, I rented it and just fell in love.  It was original, exciting and the unrated version was full of the two things I love most about Die Hard movies-violence and the F word.  When he said the Yippie Ki Yay line, I was happy to hear the word.  5 Star movie
1401300529|5.0|\\"The Coldest Winter\\"    As a Marine Sgt. in Korea, I witnessed in 1952, good and bad weather and good and bad human beings.  The book, written by David Halberstam, is  a very fine piece of work that enlightens the reader on the thoughts and  repercussions on both sides of the Pacific.  Mr Halberstam slowly builds  your recollections with a very smooth writing skill that provides numerous anecdotes that most people had not been aware of.  Although war  is a most horrible experience, the book helps me understand why war can be inevitable in many cases.  From the rifleman to the President, Halberstam's pen illuminates all that happens above and below the 38th parallel in Korea from 1950 through 1953.  A great read.
B000WCBMA8|3.0|My issue with this record is not that T.H.E. H.I.V.E.S. is a horrible song (which it absolutely is), but it's the mixing.  I hate just comparing this to Tyrannosaurus Hives (great record), but while listening to that, I never felt the need to turn it down.  I kept turning it up and bouncing around like an idiot.  Most everything was solid and even in the mix, which gave the rhythm of the drums and guitar a simplistic power.  It felt like there was more confidence in the material to mix it that way.  Here, everything seems to jump out and hit you in the ears, in order to say, \\"Hey listen to this!\\"  Whether it's the drums, or the guitars, or the singer, it just hurts.  In other parts, everything is just mixed into a bland background mush, making it sound like it's playing in the other room.  There's some variety, but for the most part, it sounds like it was mixed for kids who ruined their hearing with ipods.<br /><br />On the songwriting side, most of the songs range from decent to a little bland with a couple of awful ones peppered in.  I did like the new sound they got on \\"Hive Manor\\" and \\"Puppet on a String.\\"  Most of the other stuff sounds like bands I would listen to on the Sirius Underground Garage that would just barely keep me from changing the station.  The Hives are better than that.  Finally, \\"Fall is Something that Grownups Invented\\" is  my favorite song on the album, but it is not on the main release from what I can tell.  Still, the CD's cheap right now with a price of eight dollars, so I still recommend it, just with few caveats.
B000002MFN|5.0|This album is a masterpiece, only compared with \\"Ray of light\\" and \\"True Blue\\", but obviously with a totaly different point of view: the pleasure of sex, the relationships issues and the joy of life. Critics and fans agree in which this is one of her better works. \\"Erotica\\" is a relaxing song for me, but at the same time wakes up my sensuality, it's one of my favorites Madonna's songs. \\"Where life begings\\" have the more controversial lyrics, it's a hynm to oral sex. \\"Fever\\" an \\"Deeper and Deeper\\" are everybody favorites club anthems. \\"Bad Girl\\" describes a empty life without find the true love. \\"Thief of hearts\\" is a funny and furious accusation to those who try to still your boy/girl friend. \\"Waiting\\" have the best closing for a song: \\"And the next time you want pu***, just look in the mirror, baby\\", \\"Bye bye baby\\" talks about the breaking in relationships in a funny way since Mo's point of view. \\"In this life\\" is a brave song about how the AIDS is attacking our society. At the end, you ask yourself why critics don't give a good review to this album when it was released, it's one of best albums of the 90's
1405217057|2.0|This book came with some dissappointment. You will probably find the illustrations to be good, but there was not much of a story for my three year old. I found myself having to make up my own narration to the story. Older kids may be able to grasp the story from the illustration, but this is probably not for preschoolers.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Every now and then a tv show happens , it the case of Twin Peaks , it happened big time. The one great thing was that it left you guessing , even after the very last episode was over. This Gold Box Set is the only way to watch Twin Peaks , if you try to catch an episode here and there , then you well miss the WHOLE story. Can lighting strike twice ? , well it hasn't happened yet Twin Peaks was the best 2 years of tv ever.
0440236738|5.0|Ok, I read several of Harlan Coben's books before I read this book, Gone For Good, and I'm glad I did. This one made his other books pale in comparison. I actually listen to audiobooks in the car during a long commute for work. Scott Brick is a force unto his own in audiobook circles, however, paired with Harlan Coben's works, is a force to be reckoned with. How do I say this in a review that will be among the literate elite of Amazon... How's this? This booked rocked my socks off! I love plot twists that make me say \\"What the....\\" and this book delivers in spades. Many people have already given detailed reviews of the story and all, so I'm not going to do that yet again, however, I so enjoyed this book that I had to say something. If you like a good mystery/thriller with all of the bells and whistles including a final plot twist that left me laughing and crying at the same time, then this is your vehicle! I had to listen to the last CD three times because I just couldn't grasp what was being said. Buy it, read it, NOW! You won't be sorry except for the sleep you miss because you can't put it down...
B000I5X81A|4.0|I purchased Escondido the week it was released.  I won't go so far as to use the term \\"awesome,\\" but it is  wonderful.  Dubious at first, & not knowing much about Cale, aside from the fact that he wrote \\"After Midnight\\" & \\"Cocaine\\" for Clapton, and the great song \\"The Breeze\\" for Lynyrd Skynyrd, and that he and Eric go way back as friends.<br />Don't expect the awesome firepower of EC's guitar prowess as in \\"L&OALS.\\"  It's not that he can't do it anymore. I saw him play live on his most recent tour, and believe me, he still has the fire in him. This is just \\"different.\\"<br />I enjoy every song on this recording, and there are very few CD's I can say that about.  This CD is indeed a testament to Cale's songwriting abilities, as he wrote every song, with the exception of a sweet ditty entitled \\"Three Little Girls,\\" which was written, of course by EC about, who else?  His three little girls! Then we have Clapton joining John Mayer (who collaborated on the CD) writing \\"Hard to Thrill\\"; IMHO, not one of the brightest lights on the release, nor am I a great fan of Mayer.  Finally, we have Brownie McGhee's \\"Sporting Life Blues.\\"  Eleven of the fourteen songs are written by Cale and I'm a convert. I hope to see another Cale/Clapton CD in my future. They make a great team.<br />I'm off to check the JJ Cale section to purchase his solo stuff.  I'm a convert, indeed, and thrilled to see they won a Grammy for this album.  Much happier for JJ than Eric, who has 19 Grammys under his belt.  However, this is Cale's first, and at age 69, it is long overdue.
0060557818|5.0|So very very good.  So good.  I wish I read it years ago.  I can't wait to read it again!
B000Y179KO|3.0|I was excited to hear this album and I'm quite let down.  The second CD sounds quite experimental.  I can appreciate their branching out to embrace other styles of music, but that's not why I listen to the Eagles.  CD 1 is far better, but still lacks the songwriting and energy form previous efforts.  The vocals are impressive and the musicianship is top-notch, but the majority of the songs go nowhere.  Unless you are a die-hard, I'd avoid this one.
B000WMVJ7E|4.0|THE DARJEELING LIMITED (2007)<br /><br />INSIGHTSEEING BY RAIL<br /><br />Welcome all to \\"Wes's World\\", a tight knit group of friends and collaborators that closely resembles a vaudevillian family, a traveling troupe of players, writers, producers, and directors. Director Wes Anderson is the vertex, the hub that all others gravitate toward and hover around. On the strength of just five films in ten years, Anderson has created a cinematic niche, a new genre -the \\"Wes Anderson Film\\". His comic humanism has him compared to Francois Truffaut and Louis Malle. Early on Martin Scorsese became a fan, stating in an article for ESQUIRE that Anderson, \\"Will become the next Scorsese\\". He corralled young Wes and sat him down for a screening of Jean Renior's THE RIVER (1951). Anderson was inspired and set out to watch a lot of Indian cinema, especially those films of legendary director Satyajit Ray. He has stated that he made DARJEELING LIMITED (2007) as further proof of his fascination and inspiration. Further he dedicated the film to Ray's memory, and rather than having an original musical score done for the movie, he \\"borrowed\\" original music from several Indian films, including some of Satyajit Ray's.<br /><br />Now let's see -Roman Coppola, a buddy of Anderson's who is also brother to Sofia and son to Francis Ford, is a cousin to Jason Schwartzman, the star of Anderson's RUSHMORE (1998) and Schwartzman in a moustache is a dead ringer for Luke Wilson -who along with his brother Owen Wilson are frequent Anderson collaborators and compadres. Add Coppola's girlfriend, Jennifer Furches, along with Bill Murray and Anjelica Huston, and Ben Stiller -and we get a glimpse of the \\"Wes Anderson Stock Company\\". Many of the great filmmakers have done things this way, John Wayne learning how to do it from mentor John Ford, Clint Eastwood learning how to do it from mentor Don Siegel. After all an artist certainly can \\"trust\\" his friends, can be himself with them.<br /><br />Last year, after an inspiration from Anderson, Schwartzman and Coppola and the young maverick director boarded a train in India, and traveled for a month scouting locations for and writing the screenplay of THE DARJEELING LIMITED. Anderson claimed that part of the idea for writing about three brothers came from a John Cassavetes film, HUSBANDS (1970).<br /><br />\\"My main idea was not the train, not India, not the brothers,\\" said Wes Anderson, \\"My main idea was -I want to write with Jason and Roman.\\"<br /><br />So Schwartzman had an apartment in Rome, after filming Sofia Coppola's MARIE ANTONEITTE (2006). Wanting to get out of NYC after a decade there, Anderson came to Italy and \\"crashed\\" at Schwartzman's apartment. Then for a time he and Jason were roommates. During that period he pulled out his notebook and laid out the bare bones plot of DARJEELING LIMITED, and the movie was \\"hatched on the spot\\". They then recruited Roman, who lived there too, and there travels to India began.<br /><br />The plot of the film gave us the three Whitman brothers, Francis, Peter, and Jack, estranged for a year after their father's funeral, whom had been run down by a NYC taxi driver and met a gruesome untimely demise. The brothers were reunited in India, cajoled into coming by the eldest, Francis (Owen Wilson). Francis got his siblings to come by convincing them that this trip was their chance to reconnect as brothers, to be \\"close -like we used to be.\\" The middle brother, Peter (Adrien Brody), joined them even though his wife was expecting their first child. He traveled wearing his father's oversized sunglasses, even though the prescription was wrong for him. Later we discover he is carrying the father's razor. All three boys carry their father's 11 pieces of ornate leather luggage, hand carved and expensive. The youngest brother, Jack (Jason Schwartzman), traveled shoeless and clueless, happy to be an aimless shiftless Lothario wherever he went. Days into the trip Francis revealed that mostly thepoint of their adventure would be to find and reunite with their mother (Anjelica Huston). She had not attended her husband's funeral because she \\"didn't want to.\\" She had escaped to a remote part of India, to a convent temple, and was more than willing to completely give herself to Jesus, to a higher power, and care for dozens of ragamuffin orphans -but she had no time for her own prodigy, no time for the real world.<br /><br />I had come to see a Wes Anderson film -some kind of intellectual comedy that would be born out of sadness, a dysfunctional family struggling to function in an impartial world, something cleverly written, full of wry wit, absurdity, burlesque and vaudeville pranks and pratfalls, with characters who feel lost, consumed with their journeys that transport them first nowhere and then somewhere. After an hour of small smiles and tiny chuckles, enjoying and applauding Anderson's use of Marx Brother's manic moves, Three Stooges silliness, slow motion scenes, wide angle vistas, and a clever use of music -I suddenly found myself laughing aloud, and my cheeks were wet with tears. It happened somewhere in the story after the funeral of the drown child. This literary and cinematic territory, so wonderfully traveled in THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS (2001) -was refined for this film, and better focused.  Inexplicably Wes Anderson found a way to touch my emotions, to pressure me into some semblance of identifying with the characters, those wealthy misfits, products of a fractured family; no mean feat for a blue collar kid like myself.<br /><br />For me this film is a book end, a companion piece to THE TENENBAUMS -two somewhat parallel related plots about privileged families, whose individual members all struggle with the lack of parental guidance and love, and struggle against the influence of parental neglect and absence in their lives; trapped in their situation, fighting for their freedom. This is certainly not a tight film, nor a perfect film, but its jagged edges-- colored and back dropped with the immensity and magic of Mother India, are miraculously pulled closer together as the boys \\"let go of their baggage.\\"<br /><br />Glenn Buttkus 2007with their mother (Anjelica Huston).

B000NA2BEU|3.0|Veronica Mars became one of my favorite shows from the very first episode that I saw.  Unlike many shows about teens, particularly attractive female teens, the show was about an intelligent, crafty person who used her brains to solve problems rather than merely flaunting her sexuality, or beating people up.  Veronica had friends who cared about her and were willing to help her out in a jam. She also had a father who cared about her. It was, in fact, one of the best father daughter relationships I have ever seen on TV.  This is why the third season of the series was something of a disappointment.  In the third season, the caring, intelligent main character has changed and become a cold, calculating shrew. The writers pumped up all of her worse tendencies: paranoia, moral inflexibility, vengefulness, and downplayed her fundamental goodness and desire for justice.  The writers also removed her from the social circle that provided her with her best support and most interesting foils.  Best friend Wallace becomes a useless background character and computer wiz Mac appears largely as a method of introducing new characters who add nothing to the story.  Keith Mars, the father, undergoes a major, and rather unbelievable, personality change that again adds nothing to the overall story.  Logan, the constantly on/off boyfriend, who was interesting as a snarky secondary character, becomes merely annoying as a character in the front ranks.   Television writers really need to get over the stupid idea that romantic relationships have to be rocky to be interesting.  The worst decision that the writers and producers made, however, was to make the Dick Casablancas character a larger part of the show.  Even as a background character, Casablancas was an annoying, sexist moron. He added nothing to the show beyond a few quips and was such an horrific person that it is hard to imagine that anyone would want to spend time with him, let alone watch him every week on television.  I will say,however, that even with the problems of the third season, the series was still better than many of the shows on television and vastly superior to anything the CW currently has on. It was a mistake to cancel the series.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|MAD MEN is awesome and one of the few series TV shows that I think I would watch at least several times on DVD (my wife and I still have all of the ER releases sitting unopened.... outside of a few special occasion nights when you get a bunch of friends together to watch a season of a series as a party event, who has time to watch all of these things?). Anyway, back to the point... MAD MEN would certainly be one series I WOULD WATCH again on DVD and I was so hoping they were going to release it for this Holiday season... it would have been perfect viewing for those cold winter nights between Christmas and spring. I would guess the release of the DVD of the first season will be just ahead of the second season debut on TV next summer (if the writers strike has not gotten in the way of filming!). Probably a marketing decision but I think it would have been better to release season one of this gem of a series for this Holiday so that there would have been opportunities over the \\"off time\\" to introduce it to friends and family who have not had a opportunity, as the rest of us have had, to return to 1960 New York City and peek into the lives of these extraordinary characters. To paraphrase the comic book guy on THE SIMPSONS... \\"Best Show Ever\\"
B000MRX6SO|5.0|Seriously!!!! I love this vacuum. It holds great charge, picks up just about everything, and can be used on carpet or hard floors. I have 2 very messy boys, and I use this 4-5 times a day. I would highly recommend this vac to anyone. I also have a cat and it picks up hair too. It has little sweepers in the corners too so it will also get along edges. This would be a great gift for anyone!!!!
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I have enjoyed this DVD very much The way its organized, by different habitats, is a good system If you're a nature documentary fan as I am, this is the ultimate series to have in DVD
B000VBJEEG|3.0|Initially I loved the story but the animations of pixstar are usually much better than the ones on this film.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I would like echo all the complaints that people have stated about this edition of the DVD. If you already have a previous edition of it, then you are fine with the one that you have. But if you do not have \\"Jaws\\" already on DVD, then you are in for a real treat.  This edition features some excellent bonus features, including a two hour long documentary on the making of the movie, as well as a nicely put together scrapbook of pictures and quotes from the cast and crew. But, let's be honest, you could put out \\"Jaws\\" as a bare bones DVD and it would still be mandatory.  And that's because after thirty plus years the film still manages to have the same visceral reaction as it did upon it's release. It's still a scary, taut, perfectly pieced together thriller. And on this DVD it looks as sharp and crisp as it ever has, and the soundtrack is well mixed and put together.  So, if for some reason, you do not own \\"Jaws\\", this is a must purchase for you, because films rarely get better than this.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Gilmour is great but I'm not kidding anyone, I wanted to hear the old Floyd tunes. The slightly different version of Shine On You Crazy Diamond and the performance of Echoes make the DVD worth every penny. There are a few songs that although they are great, I didn't really needed to hear again, specially since they're not that different from the studio version or the other Gilmour DVDs. However, there's plenty of surprises in the extras so I won't hold it against it. Gilmour makes Arnold Layne sound like it was written yesterday (the version with Bowie it's amazing), and Dark Globe is heart pounding, it makes you realize how great Syd was. The other highlight for me is Wot's... Uh The Deal?. The first time I heard that song I was 22 and what I liked about it was the phrase \\".. cause there's a chill wind blowing in my soul and I think I'm growing old...\\". It's 10 years later and I'm thinking NOW I'm really growing old... As far as Gilmour is concern, what can I say? He doesn't play his guitar he makes love to it. Don't think about it too much, if you like Gilmour or the Floyd buy this DVD now.
B000HCO83Q|1.0|this movie is a disgrace.    SPOILER warning    Why do they think they could get away with killing Dr X?  no.  thats wrong.  he doesnt die  ESPECIALLY CYCLOPS he never dies in the comics or the tv show?  this movie makes no sense.  especially when they use THREE darts to take out magneto instead of saving one for jean grey.   she wouldnt have had to die.  and neither would the series.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This is the best documentary I've seen from Michael Moore.  It's hillarious, sad and familiar all at the same time.  Sicko brings to light voices that usually go unheard in the general media in the U.S.  Yes people do get quality healthcare outside of the U.S., despite what the health insurance industry and its minions would like everyone to think.  People in a number of other countries aren't forced into bankruptcy in order to have decent quality medical care.<br /><br />Many americans will readily identify with the experiences of the individuals highlighted in the film.  Whether you have health insurance or not, this documentary will have you nodding your head in agreement and shaking your head in disbelief at the comparisons between how the medical system in the U.S. is run versus countries such as Canada, the U.K., France and Cuba.<br /><br />All in all Sicko is a highly entertaining and moving documentary.
B000IMUYJM|5.0|Turn down the lights and be ready to pull a blanket over your head when the psychotic hiding in the attic decides its time to come down for another kill.  Your probably do not want to watch this with little kids unless you do not care about your electric bill, because they won't ever sleep with the lights off ever again.  Don't say I didn't warn you.  If the twist and turns of this movie seem familiar, its because this movie has been ripped off by more horror directors than you can shake a bloody stick at.  However, this is the original, semi-low budget, sorority house massacre.  If you like to be scared, you'll love it.
B000UBMSB8|4.0|\\"Yep, I have to throw in my two cents with those who kinda liked the narration in the original theatrical release of BLADE RUNNER. When I saw the film in its first run, being a big fan of Film Noir, I LOVED the idea of a Raymond Chandleresque voiceover, shweetheart.\\"                          By  LP45CDwoman    me too!! i thought that i was the only person who thought that way. i'd get: \\"your'nuts! it's not a noir movie! it's sci-fi!\\" or \\"all that gabbing is distracting.\\" or \\"i don't like it when they tell you what's going on\\" from most of my friends.   we'll it's BOTH! future noir! and sometimes, insight is a good thing!    labled \\"cyber-punk\\" after the fact, this temultuous, complex study of the ego/id cunundrum is the best thing to come out of the 80s for sci-fi(besides empire strikes back, of course).     i wore out theatrical versions VSH several times over. block buster thought i was nuts when i grabbbed all 5 VHS copies at a five dollar sale back in college.
159562015X|4.0|I love the upgraded strengths test but the content of 'Now, discover your strengths' was better.  Overall I would definitly reccomend it, discovering my natural talents has helped me shape a more specific direction for my life.  Well worth it :)
B00003CXD5|5.0|Hog, am I? If I had never met people like Humphrey Bogart's character, this line of dialogue would sound ridiculous. And so would the scene. But, alas, the world is filled with people like this, even in the 21st Century. I laugh and shake my head every time I see it. Great job, Bogart! And everyone else. One of my few five-star films.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|My daughter first saw this movie when she was 3 and loved it.  And now, she gets so excited when we are about to play the movie.  It is a wonderful tale that is sure to get your whole family in the holiday spirit.
032147404X|5.0|This book has helped me tremendously in conceptualizing the different aspects of photography and of how to properly use my camera.  I thought my pictures were fine before but this book has taken me to the next level!  I enjoyed the light humor that pervades the book; it certainly keeps one's attention.  I also think how each page is self-contained with a sample picture for illustration helps in minimizing cognitive load.  It is a well written book and a great tool for helping one progress from the novice level toward the amateur level.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|The story began a little slow and lost my daughter's interest - age 4, but once they bear came into the picture, she really got interested and enjoyed the story and the songs.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|To me, this is what \\"The Wall\\" was actually shooting at. It hangs together a lot better, and I actually like the music more to. If you like Pink Floyd, and you don't have this album, give it a chance. It is a very dark album, but it works. It helps to hear this on a good system, has a greater dynamic range than most rock albums, used to very good effect.
1594489505|5.0|Absolutely one of the best books in helping us to understand the Middle Eastern culture and mindset.  It is not for the faint-of-heart as violence is an everyday occurrence in Afghanistan currently, but the resilience and spirit of her people are clearly evident in the book.  The women of Afghanistan are truly courageous!  I read this book in 3 days--couldn't put it down...  A wonderful companion to the Kite Runner...  Thank you Mr. Hosseini for painting a picture for us--even though it's fiction, I know there are many facts and depictions of what has gone on in your country of origin.
1577314808|1.0|This book is typical of many, many new-age spiritual guidebooks. It is chock full of hollow assertions and feel-good assurances. Better to spend hard-earned cash on HItchens and Dawkins.
B00005JKZV|4.0|Beginning note: The reason I give this 4/5 stars is to put it in comparison too the other two.    Lord of the Rings is the greatest motion picture* of all time, no question about it. It's better than Alien, better than Star Wars, it's better than all of them. Though the movie I am currently reviewing is the weakest volume of the story. This by no means makes it a bad film, on the contrary it is among the best films I have ever seen, it's just not nearly as good as the other two. The reason for this is because this one edges into the realm of an action film, the ending is a 30 minute battle sequence, one of the best battle sequences ever filmed, but still a very long battle sequnce. Peter Jackson has done a magnificent job at molding a story in the middle of a battle, he proves that in this movie, but he does an even better job in the volume following this one, The Return of the King.    As I said before, the rating is just to put it in it's place with the rest of the series.    9/10 stars, two thumbs up, bravo.    *I put this in terms of one film because it's less like watching three films and more like watching 3 parts of one film
B000OLGCI4|5.0|What's not to like?! This DVD has all the charm, music, plus re-mastering, to make this 40 year anniversary of Jungle Book a perfect stocking stuffer! Buy it and enjoy it~ for yourself, your kids, your grandchildren! A+++++!!!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|This extended version is by far, the one extended version of the Lord of the Rings that made the most improvements to the original version. The theatrical Two Towers was not quite as good as the other two, but this version definitely brings it up too snuff with them. This version fleshes out the characters more, and makes the film itself more enjoyable. Now if you didn't like the film in the first place this probably won't make you like it anymore than before, but if you're a fan of \\"The Rings\\" then this is a must-see.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|This film was so well made and inspiring that it made me want to go out and devour anything I can find on Gandhi.  We need more Gandhis today!!
1594489505|4.0|Gone are the huge coincidences that plagued the plot in \\"The Kite Runner\\", so Hosseini has learned something there, but the story is not quite as compelling and the historical background of the region does not play out as well.  At times the novel is truly gripping, but it lags in the final act and I almost lost interest and was ready for it to end.  Still a worthy follow up overall and a novel that I would certainly recommend on many levels.
B000053VAZ|3.0|the movie over all is cute and good, but it is definitely not a industry breaker.<br /><br />Most definitely a chick flick and it's a movie worth having on a girl night, but I haven't watched it again since I got it.<br />It's not a movie that's worth tracking down, nor is it worth much more than about the 10 dollars.
1845761502|5.0|This book offer's good ideas for indipendent fimmakers. Though the book's cover has poor CGI, the info given is incomparable. The behind the scenes views of Winston telling the animatronic Tyrannosaurus his stage directions and meeting a friend at the premiere of Congo are pictures of a welcome change (Serious prop work to humor). In closing, the book is great.
0920668372|5.0|I love reading this book to my daughter! Classic, very heartfelt. Definatly a book I would recommend! ;)
0596101996|5.0|Well written and concise language description. Especially good for programmers who want to learn the language.
B00005OCMR|5.0|I love this movie.  My kids and wife don't appreciate it the way I do, so I suspect there is a considerable nostalgia effect on me.  I like.
B000063CMK|5.0|This is another outstanding album from the band.  Another conceptual album this one covers an amazing amount of musical ground ranking up with the best the band has done.  The music, vocals and lyrics are all top notch.  This is progressive metal at its finest.  Highlights include the three longest tracks on the disc \\"A Trace Of Blood\\", \\"The Road Ends\\" and \\"Beyond The Pale\\".  Really the whole disc is strong.  This album is another must own for fans of innovative progressive metal.
B000003TAL|5.0|This album is a concrete example on how music can become so much better once you let it sink in.  Now, I am a newcomer to this kind of music that Sonic Youth does, the closest thing that I've heard from this is Loveless by My Bloody Valentine.  That particular album has different, easy, erotic melodies, this doesn't have as much.  To be fair, this is my first Sonic Youth album, but it definitely will make me check out more Sonic Youth.  The first time I've heard this, it sounded quite boring actually.  I like Silver Rocket and Eric's Trip from the beggining, but a lot of the album was kind of hard to ramp up.  Particually the intro guitars were meh, not much of a hook. Bland, even. But Sonic Youth don't rely on hooks, and they shouldn't.  Once you uncover more melody, understand more of the lyrics, etc etc, it becomes better.  It cetainly did for me.<br /><br />Let's get the bad stuff out of the way.  Kim Gordon's vocals are annoying in 'Cross the Breeze.  She doesn't even sound like a woman, especially yelling out \\"I wanna Know!\\" over...and over...and over.  Ugh.  Those vocals really take away the song, which has a good intro and outro.  The Sprawl, while a good song, does seem to get a bit tiring.  I don't see the big deal about Teenage Riot either, it seems a bit mediocre to me.  Since the lyrics really don't appeal to me, it's harder for me to get the whole point of the song.  Still, it's a small list compared to the complaints I had on my first listen (I don't even remember them).<br /><br />But good?  Oh man, let me first give my props to the rhythm section.  Kim Gordon's bass is dense and puncuates at the best times (Total Trash), and Steve Shelley is a furious drummer.  One of the main things of Sonic Yout h that I like is his furious, energetic, pounding drumming.  Whoever says drums are unimportant haven't heard bands like these.  Lee (forgot last name) and Thurston Moore guitars go unserved.  Wrapped in audio radiation, dreamlike tones, furious guitar riffs, and feedback laden noisescapes, these guys are one _______ of a _________ pair.  These guys are talented and know their stuff.<br /><br />Despite the three songs mentioned before have their flaws, they aren't bad, and the rest of the songs here are great.  You got Silver Rocket and Eric's Trip, and Hey Joni, three energetic songs with pounding beats (gotta love Eric's Trip).  Total Trash, said before, is a workout of noise rock, one of the best songs on here.  Rain King is dark just like the title, with Candle flickering like a candle (ha ha).  I also like Providence, which I really don't understand why people hate this song.  The piano backed up with crackling guitar and a voice over from Mike Watt always get me.  Kissability is a little odd, but Kim Gordon's message comes across loud and clear, and does it with a way that we can take her seriously and understand, something that hack Courtney Love could never do right.  Ditto for The Sprawl.  Of course, the Trilogy at the end is a perfect closer.  Really, not a single bad song on here (despite the flaws of some of them).<br /><br />My head hurt, and I felt thirsy after listening to this album after getting it.  Maybe I just wasn't ready for it.  Yeah right, I'm ready for all kinds of music, no matter how inaccessible something is, I'll take the plunge.  You should to.  This album really introduced me to Sonic Youth, and It was a great introduction to the band.  CHeck it out now.<br /><br />9/10laden noisescapes, these guys are one _______ of a _________ pair.

B000Y179KO|3.0|I listened to the entire set 3 times and decided I like disc 2 way better than disc 1.  Most of the songs are ok, but the political rantings and syrupy love songs wear thin very quickly.  My only complaints about disc 2 are the long wind/flute intro to the title track and the 2 slow tracks (6&8).  My favorite track by far is the Joe Walsh slacker rock tune \\"Last Good Time in Town\\".  The goofy lyrics and incredible guitar work make it stand out instantly.  His other tune \\"Guilty of the Crime\\" is repetitive, but still fun to listen to.  The best thing I can say about this project is the harmonies still sound great and I'm glad they got back together.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This is by far Brit's best album. Everybody should buy it. This is pop music at it's finest. Britney is definately a living legend. She has been poised to take Madonna's place and this album tottally cements her status as the reigning princess (soon to be queen) of pop. Everybody else look out Brit's back and she's got new vibe. Everybody go out and buy this album you will not be disappointed.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project's sophomore effort I Robot was released in June of 1977.<br />Alan Parsons Project was the namesake band of wunderkind British producer/engineer Alan Parsons whom had made a name for himself being a tape operator when The Beatles recorded Sgt Pepper and an engineer when they made Abbey Road and Let it Be and also engineered Pink Floyd's albums Atom Heart Mother (as an assistant engineer) and Dark Side of the Moon. In addition, produced records for The Hollies, Al Stewart and Pilot among others.<br />The album was the follow-up to the band's debut Tales and Mysteries From Edgar Allen Poe (which was released on Charisma Records in the UK and 20th Century Records in the US) and was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in late 1976/early 1977. The album was the band's first for Arista Records, whom they signed with after the one-off deal with 20th Century expired. I Robot was a concept album about the rise of the computers and machines and the fall of man (a concept that has proved prophetic in this computer age). The musicians on the album, in addition to Parsons and collaborator/keyboard player Eric Woolfson, is almost all of Pilot (the same band who had a hit two years earlier with \\"Magic\\") which were bass player David Paton, guitarist Ian Bairston and drummer Stuart Tosh (whom would step down as Parsons' drummer after I Robot's release). Plus orchestrator Andrew Powell and several singers (see below). At the time of this album's release, punk and new wave were becoming the rage in England whilst prog rock and arena rock still ruled in the US. Would this album be a classic or lumped a poor man's prog, read on.<br />we start with the album's opening title cut. The Synthi-A loop segued into a collage of synthesizers and a female soprano singing above it before the band comes in and plays a funky pattern for the rest of the piece with a choir singing in unison with the piece. Next is the album's biggest hit, the disco-ish \\"I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You\\". This track (featuring Lenny Zatatek on lead vocal) is one Hell of a funky rock track (it predates the disco craze that would hit America like an atom bomb at the end of 1977). Great number. \\"Some Other Time\\" is next and is a beautifully well arranged and recorded song. This song makes you feel like you are going into a different time and place! The track features Peter Straker and Jaki Whitten on lead vocals (the former on verses and the latter on the choruses). Next is the funky sounding \\"Breakdown\\". This is another great song and featured ex-Hollies lead singer Allan Clarke on lead vocals. \\"Don't Let It Show\\" ends the first half on a great note. the track is sung passionately by Dave Townsend and is a beautiful song. Female rocker Pat Benatar obviously loved the tune so much that it was featured on her 1979 debut album In the Heat of the Night.<br />\\"The Voice\\" begins the album's second half and features Cockney Rebel frontman Steve Harley on vocals and what a great piece. Next is the second of FOUR instrumentals called \\"Nucleus\\" which had more innovative usage of synthesizers. We segue into \\"Day After Day (The Show Must Go On)\\" which is another outstanding song featuring Jack Harris on lead vocal and BJ Cole on pedal steel guitar. We segue into \\"Total Eclipse\\" which blended synthesizers with choirs for a unique track. \\"Genesis Chapter. 1 Verse: 32\\" ends the album. This instrumental which combines band, orchestra and choir to end the album on a majestic note.<br />I Robot peaked at #9 on the Billboard album charts and sold over a million copies Stateside therefore going Platinum in the process.<br />Thirty years later, the album is now re-issued with the original album art and digitally remastered sound done by Parsons himself and FIVE BONUS TRACKS. The first is a demo of the album's title cut called \\"Boules\\". Then it's early demos and rough mixes of \\"Breakdown\\", \\"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\\" and \\"Day After Day\\". We end with \\"The Naked Robot\\" which was a medley of rough mixes that made up the album.<br />I Robot may be 30 now but the music still sounds as fresh as it did in 1977.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!es that made up the album.   I Robot may be 30 now but the music still sounds as fresh as it did in 1977.   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0440238609|1.0|Pure drivel, just like 98% of everything else that makes it to the bestseller list these days.  But in defense to Mr. Pullman, he is not the one wasting our time.  Only we are to blame for that.
031286504X|4.0|Good reading and interesting enough to make it a fast read.  I was a littel surprised to find out that I am Legend is a short story.  It is followed by many other, much shorter stories.  My wife read the book too.  She felt there was not a good line of demarcation between I am Legend and the following stories--so much that she was surprised and thought the book was hard to follow.<br /><br />I am Legend though is definitely worth the read.  The character is well developed by the end and the story is hard to put down.
0316010669|1.0|This book literally teaches you to judge a book by it's cover. I totally disagree. There were many times in my life that I had a bad \\"blink\\" thought about some one or something but ignored it and realized that it was a smart move! So don't believe everything you read...

B00004U8JV|4.0|So as far as sequels go, this is far from the train-wreck many reviewers make it out to be.  Is it as amazing as the original `Jurassic Park'?  No, but that doesn't make this a failure of a film.  In fact, I happen to much enjoy `The Lost World' and feel that, while it could have been better I can't really find much I dislike about it.  There is lots of intense sequences, some stylized deaths and there's that whole `T-Rex gone mad' scene at the end that makes this whole rendezvous worth it.  Sure, the plot is a little tired and it's a little ridiculous when you think about it (albeit `Jurassic Park III' is even more ridiculous) but if you just want a good action flick with realistic special effects then `The Lost World: Jurassic Park' will not disappoint.<br /><br />So we meet up with Ian Malcolm again this time played less annoyingly by Jeff Goldblum (I was not a fan of his character in the first film but here he seems to have gotten a hold of his performance and ironed it out).  Ian is still shaken by his encounter with the cold-blooded beasts in the first film, and rightfully so.  When he finds out that there is a second island hosting the dinosaurs he is far from interested until he hears that his girlfriend Sarah Harding is already on the island studying the dinosaurs (it's ridiculous to me that she would go there alone...that would NOT happen) and so he immediately gets together a rescue team to travel to the island.  Little does he know that he has a stowaway aboard, his daughter Kelly.<br /><br />The rescue team is thwarted by the efforts of another team sent for an entirely different purpose.  This makes big trouble for the group, especially when they take matters into their own hands.<br /><br />Remember that this is an action film.  The story is assumed less important than the graphics and so it does take a backseat unfortunately.  The acting is descent for a film of this nature.  Like I said, Goldblum ups his game in that he is far less annoying this go around (which is a good thing since he has a much larger role).  Julianne Moore can add another film to her r&eacute;sum&eacute; she can be ashamed of, but at least her performance isn't horrid.  Vince Vaughn to me was a standout, but again, he's been much better in many other films.  Vanessa Lee Chester is a descent young actress.<br /><br />The real actors though are the people in charge of creating the dinosaurs and they do a dynamic job once again.  There are a slew of creative action scenes that make up for the lack of depth in the plot.  The raptor attack through the field is great, as is their ambush at the communications tower (although the whole acrobatics scene is horrifically stupid).  The T-Rex though is champ here for his two main scenes are the best in the film.  The whole `trailer over the cliff' scene (which was the best part of the novel by the way) is brilliantly constructed, and the whole `T-Rex loose through the city' scene at the end (which is so `King Kong') is just amazing.  They also introduce a new dinosaur this go around, these little devils that hunt in packs.<br /><br />So, while `The Lost World' is not as well crafted as the original `Jurassic Park' it is still very enjoyable and worth our attention.  I'm sure most everyone has seen this movie so I don't think it's a movie you `recommend' as much as discuss.  So, for all of you who have your own opinions of this movie, what do you think?  Am I right, wrong or somewhere in between?d thing since he has a much larger role).  Julianne Moore can add another film to her résumé she can be ashamed of, but at least her performance isn't horrid.  Vince Vaughn to me was a standout, but again, he's been much better in many other films.  Vanessa Lee Chester is a descent young actress.      The real actors though are the people in charge of creating the dinosaurs and they do a dynamic job once again.  There are a slew of creative action scenes that make up for the lack of depth in the plot.  The raptor attack through the field is great, as is their ambush at the communications tower (although the whole acrobatics scene is horrifically stupid).  The T-Rex though is champ here for his two main scenes are the best in the film.  The whole `trailer over the cliff' scene (which was the best part of the novel by the way) is brilliantly constructed, and the whole `T-Rex loose through the city' scene at the end (which is so `King Kong') is just amazing.  They also introduce a new dinosaur this go around, these little devils that hunt in packs.    So, while `The Lost World' is not as well crafted as the original `Jurassic Park' it is still very enjoyable and worth our attention.  I'm sure most everyone has seen this movie so I don't think it's a movie you `recommend' as much as discuss.  So, for all of you who have your own opinions of this movie, what do you think?  Am I right, wrong or somewhere in between?
B00005K3NY|2.0|I saw this movie when I was much younger and loved it back then. Now that I am older and watching the movie I did not find it as good as I remembered. A few good scenes of exploding heads and melting faces but over all not very exciting.
B00005JPCF|2.0|I was surprisingly disappointed with *Happy Feet*.  Previous animated films had just kept getting better and better but *Happy Feet* was totally opposite.<br /><br />First of all, Mumble, the star of this film, is just cute, cute, cute!  He's a tap dancer which something that his fellow emperor penguins are not happy about because they're supposed to have a graceful heartsong.  Alas, Mumble cannot sing but he sure can dance.<br /><br />And then, that was just about it!  The rest of the story didn't make sense.  First of all, too many songs!  Seriously, *The Sound of Music*, which I'm not quite fond of, is something I'd rather watch than to go through this again.  At least, TSOM didn't overkill with songs.<br /><br />Then, I get the subtle message about the environment and fishing but it was not effective here.  However, the part where Mumble summons up the courage to go after the ship from diving off a high mountain but somehow ended up in captivity just didn't make sense.  Worse, it continued to be  senseless til the end of the movie.<br /><br />Despite its lousy plot, the animation was good.  In fact, too good that it might be a little too scary for young kids.  The leopard seal and orcas are menacing that they'll give your kids nightmares.<br /><br />However, I'd still wouldn't watch this movie again.

B00004U2EZ|5.0|[[ASIN:B00004U2EZ Notre Dame de Paris]]  [[ASIN:B00005Y7KX Notre Dame de Paris]]  My wife and I both loved the audio CD and the DVD. The DVD is outstanding and the audio CD, if anything, is even better. Noa singing the the Part of Esmeralda is superb.

B0009U55SI|5.0|I am one to avoid expressions like superlative, quintessential, the best, ultimate and the like...but this reading of Mahler's 4th has astonished me.  The texture and detail that Reiner with the CSO at his command is able to pull out of the score is unlike any other reading I have ever heard of this piece.  Every instrumental component of the orchestra rings clear and the sound quality is stunning.  It is hands above most modern readings in terms of audio quality alone and these guys were dealing with three strategically placed microphones.  Not  so bad if you ask me.  Even if you have others in your collection, such as I, like Bernstein I / II, Gielen, Bertini, Tilson Thomas and on, you should add this to your collection without delay.  It has revealed to me elements of the score and as such Mahler's compositional grammar that I was not aware of before.  An absolute must for any self respecting Mahlerite.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Well done drama about the men of Easy company. Each episode takes you on the journey with the men as they jump throughout Europe. Special features are well done and each episode comes with summary and explanation of terms and places (as well as a nice timeline for WWII).
B00007LTIC|5.0|The one thing you will get with Yes is originality. This album is no exception. I would consider this particular of Yes musicians (it has changed over the years) to be the best and at thier prime.<br /><br />The album is very unusual in that Steve Howe uses a steel guitar in some of the songs. For those of you that dont know that is the typical twangy Country guitar that sits flat.<br /><br />Steve Howe is magnificent. He can play anything with strings. If you ever see him in concert you will see him switch between guitars in the middle of songs especially accoustic to electric.<br /><br />The man is phenomenal.<br /><br />The keyboarding is also dynamite on this album as well as the vocals.<br /><br />Wondrous stories should be considered a vocal masterpiece in my book.

I have always been into this genre of rock. Preferring such bands as Rush, Yes and Boston.<br /><br />I would like to go back to the 70's when the rock was pure and hard.<br /><br />Well you can go back to the 70's by just listening to this album. Let it take you back!!!

0743486285|4.0|It was a brave decision for Nikki Sixx to delve into his past and bring The Heroin Diaries out into the light for all to scrutinize. The book is an interesting mix of memoir and hindsight analysis. Nikki has taken his diary, that was kept beginning on Christmas day in 1986 through the Christmas of 1987, and released it, warts and all, for public consumption in the hopes of helping a few people out. It documents a dark time in his life where he battled the dragon while chasing it every once in a while.<br /><br />Throughout the diary, you get a peek into the thoughts of a junkie. Of course, we're never sure how honest the thoughts are, as he is obviously lying even to himself and the diary at some points. Nikki also enlisted the help of friends, family, and business associates who added their own version of some of the events and their insights, as well. He also engages in the exercise of relating what he did to how he feels today and how his actions have affected him and others.<br /><br />This is a fabulous addendum to Motley Crue's biography, The Dirt, as it takes a piece of time and expands it in a very personal way. It illustrates how someone can be king of his domain yet still be completely out of control and out of touch, creating his own reality of addiction and paranoia.<br /><br />Proceeds from the book go to Nikki's favorite charity, Running Wild in the Night, which helps homeless teens on the streets of Hollywood, making it well worth the purchase price.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I've been waiting for a complete DVD set of the entire series for a long time, and this set definitely doesn't disappoint.    A must have for Twin Peaks fans.  Would also be a great gift for anyone who you think might like this quirky series.

B0007XAWB2|5.0|Churchill said, \\"War, which used to be cruel and magnificent, has become cruel and squalid\\".  One of the reasons for our fascination with the Napoleonic War is that it was the last major conflict before war became squalid.    C.S. Forester's Hornblower and Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe make for terrific pulp fiction, but Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey and Maturin make for sublime literature.     Not everyone will love these books at first exposure. The 18th-century nautical terminology can be daunting.  But like all great literature, their value is not in specific settings or events, but in the exposition of human relationships.     Jack Aubrey is the quintessential man of action--robust, instinctive, unreflective, brave, garrulous.  His ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin is Jack's opposite--frail, dark, taciturn, introspective. The only trait they share is a love of music.  But they become devoted friends, occasional rivals, mutual critics, and mututal admirers.      These books are a single long tale of action and manners.  Their core theme is revelation of character through constraint:  the physical confines of the ship; the threat from the enemy; the quirky and corrupt English Admiralty of the time; the class system, which Jack and Stephen both live on the fringes of; the elaborate rules of social behavior, made almost tyrannical by custom and the yearning for acceptance (though Jack's high-spiritedness often flouts them); and the imperfections of language, which cause much misunderstanding between shipmates, friends, and lovers.     Action and humor, love and fear, bravery and cowardice, mania, narcissm, and depression, intrigue, subtlety, boldness, ignorance, self-dealing, and altruism--all these are here.    Those readers who have come to a stall in their reading lists should pick up the first volume and give it a diligent hundred pages.  Chances are they will be hooked, and life will never be quite the same again.
B000002UAF|5.0|This album is so great that it has held up throughout the years.  I have a four year old daughter that always wants to hear this record, thank god that she seems to be aquireing excellent taste in music.  Listen to the song \\"A Hard Days Night\\" closely and you will notice the guitar part that is sped up.  I notice new things still with Beatles tunes after so many listenings.  This is a must have for any fan of rock 'n' roll music.

B000WMEAKC|5.0|I listen to music every day while I'm at work. I listen to a lot of my favorite music, but I'm usually able to check out 3 new albums a week. This morning, I listened to Dreaming Out Loud.<br /><br />There are some albums you queue up an know immediately they're going to be great. This was one of those albums. After listening to all the tracks, I was compelled to tell a couple of my co-workers, \\"This album is one of the Top 5 I've heard this year.\\" That's the highest praise I can give it. I think it's fantastic. A couple of the songs do sound similar, but they're different enough to be enjoyed as separate songs.<br /><br />I would describe the sound of this album as optimistic Coldplay - musically solid with great lyrics and even better production. I recommend it as one of my Top 5 albums of the year!
0743298039|5.0|WOW!!! could not put this book down.  It pulled on all my emotions and kept me in the middle of this story. Powerful read.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|This movie is just splendid.  All the reviews trying to analyze the story line have missed the point completely.  Its a magical story of how two people found each other, and how thier lives entertwined.  It's meant to entertain and grab your attention, and not many movies these days do catch my attention while i'm flipping through the 30 or so movie channels you can have at any one time.  It was delightful, enchanting and for that hour and 39 minutes I didn't have to analyze a darn thing.  Loved it.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|I bought this movie because of a college design project. The project was to create a symbolic poster for the movie Babel. This movie is pretty intense, but is amazing when you pay attention to all of the detail put into it. So much of it is symbolic. It also really makes you think about our world and our place in it.
0307276902|5.0|I don't care if this book is lies.  I don't care if this book is the truth. I don't care if it is half truth and half lies. I don't care that, as a man, I cried.  But I do care that this book, although rather crudely written, was one of the most powerful works of literature that I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  And yes, I would love to meet James Frey and share his new love for life, and maybe a Diet Coke.
B000UR9T7I|4.0|I won't even try to review the movie, I enjoyed it and loved the bountiful special features on the Blu-ray version. The main thing I wanted to point out is that some Blu-ray players take a long time to load the Spiderman 3 movie disc (with a \\"loading\\" bar repeated moving across the screen for 1 minute or so). At first I thought my disc was defective due to this. I don't know if this will be a trend for Blu-ray discs, but this is the first out of about 20 that I have noticed this extended load time.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|Once my children (ages 8,6, and 5) got over the fact they were watching a \\"brown\\" movie (their word for blk and white), they were delighted with this film.  Usually they are viewing Hannah Montana and Suite Life with Zack and Cody so I thought a change was in order.  Very very funny film for grown ups and kids.  The rapid fire dialogue was hilarious!  We highly reccomend it.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This DVD sent to me fast! It was professionally sealed and the item it self was in totally great shape, now the DVD is one of my collections.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Overall a great album, worth every cent I payed    Quick overview of each song (leaving out Wasted Reprise)    1. Life Wasted - Very much sounds like it could be cut from the middle of Vs, a very up-tempo song with an extremely catchy guitar line.    2. World Wide Suicide - Good political rock song, you've probably heard it already and have an opinion on it.    3. Comatose - Sounds like something of the cut of Spin the Black Circle, very short, very intense, very gratifying.    4. Severed Hand - Maybe the best song on the CD. Will probably be the Given to Fly of this CD, may not be the mega radio hit, but a fan favorite.    5. Marker in the Sand - Best refrain they have in the CD, very good song.    6. Parachutes - Like the guitar, hate the song, doesn't do it for me.    7.Unemployable - Really liked it when I first heard it, haven't fallen for it since. Good song, but gets lost around the significantly better ones earlier.    8. Big Wave - Very cool surfy song.    9. Gone - Great deep song, probably their best since Black.    10. Army Reserve - A song that keeps growing on me, the guitar is almost hynotic, obviously another anti-war song    11. Comeback - My personal favorite song on the CD, nice song, awesome solo.    12. Inside Job - To be honest, I haven't really listened enough to it to pass judgment.    If you like Pearl Jam, you'll like this CD.
B000OY8NII|1.0|This review is regarding the awful packaging of this product, and not of the merits of the show itself. Eureka is a show that you either love or hate. If you fall into the hate category, you're not going to be considering buying it anyway.    The DVD trays are made out of potatoes. Really. The product is so soft, the discs will not stay in place no matter how careful you try to close the case, and they wind up slipping out of the bottom. It's sort of like a fine grain Styrofoam. The sliding around smudges the discs, and leaves tiny specks of material clinging to them.     The material is supposed to be environmentally friendly. That would be great if this were a disposable product, but who buys DVD sets and throws away the packaging? I also can't imagine that this material is going to have a very long shelf life - especially if it were to get exposed to humidty and/or heat.    Stoopid, stoopid, stoopid. I might have to cannibalize plastic inserts from somewhere else and glue them into the sleeve.
0060751967|2.0|I am a big vampire fiction reader and have read many other vampire romance/adventure novels in the past. Although this books keeps you somewhat interested you never really dive into the story. It's too cliche and everything seemed too convenient. All the characters lack depth, and when she tries to make each one quirky it comes off as trying too hard. One guy was too Russian, One girl was too Parisian, Another guy was too nervous. Most books have a way of expressing themselves and you can imagine how the main character looks, acts and feels, with this main character I kept changing her in my head about 50 times. Was she smart? Dumb? Ugly? Who knows! Half way through the book nothing exciting has happened, and when something exciting DOES happen it falls short. I've read fan fiction better than this!    However, if you like fluff than this may be the book for you it does have some cute moments and again it is a romance novel.
B00005JPRD|3.0|This movie made me cry.  Not because I was emotionally struck by the characters or story, but because the movie is a battle between bad ideas and brilliance, between art and commercial sap, innovation and cliche; and it depressed me that ultimately the weaknesses of this movie overpower the strengths. So I'm giving it 2.25 stars for the good moments: the fact that the acting and singing new versions of Beatles songs were well done, the artistic brilliance of Julie Taymor was apparent, but too infrequently, and the script had a bit of wit. But so sad that the story is really just a string of cliches and scenes which exist only so a song can be fit in. The characters which had nothing to do and existed only because their name is in a song(Prudence, Jojo, Mr. Kite, Dr. Robert), and the overlong scenes which made me cringe and really should have been cut down or cut out (A Little Help From My Friends, and Blackbird). So sad.  Please start with a better script next time Ms. Taymor.

B000PKG7I4|5.0|Amy Winehouse is a really great singer.  Many critics compare her to Macy Gray or Erykah Badu.  In my opinion, she surpasses both of these ladies in style and musical ability. She sounds very much like Dinah Washington.  (I'm over 50, so I prefer the singers from the old school).
B000NA2BEU|5.0|With the network switch I missed the 3d season entirely, and now that I've got the DVDs I'm feeling the pain of the midseason cancellation.
B0002V7O3S|4.0|Really good movie it's based om a true incident and what happens when one person disappears and town and the media turn it in to a circus. Watch the last few minutes of the movie it's really intense.    Great Movie
0739343718|5.0|The words in \\"Chesil Beach\\" are carefully placed, like a craftsman building a stone wall, fitting and re-fitting each stone until everything interlocks. I listened to the audio CD, featuring McEwan's own rendering of the story. In the interview afterward, he talks about how reading it out loud is a final editing process and how much he loves previewing works in progress. The effort shows. In some books, you look for a telling detail to verify the authenticity, something that demonstrates the author knows what he's writing about. With McEwan, it seems like all telling detail. The terror of \\"Chesil Beach\\" is a fright of manners, custom and miscommunication. The build-up to the wedding night is excrutiating and wonderful, carved moments of granite. The aftermath is palpable. Novel? Long story? I got more out of this than some monster novels.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|yes my friends you read correct. this album is defidently dream theater's strongest album sinse six degrees of innner turbulence. it is pretty much a mix of all of DT's best sides. best of their prog,metal,and more calm rock sides all mixed in one. and this is also their best playing sinse six degrees. the emotion from scenes is also brought back at times. jordan really shines on here. and petrucci plays some of his best solos ever! and the new 25 min epic is amazing!     here is a short song by song review,    In the prescense of enemies pt 1 - 5/5 -  amazing opener! Very Progressive track! opens up with a 5 min intromental insanity. sounds like a more heavy edged metropolis pt2! after a emotional transistion james kicks in about 5 mins into the song. after about 4 mins a crazy unisink between petrucci and rudess strats up. than there is a very smooth transistion into the next song.    Forsaken - 4.5/5  forsaken is a great track. its a more straight folward song. but its not like the slower songs on octavarium (witch i thought dragged a bit) this song is more like their classic ballads. just a bit heavyer. very catchy song    Constant Motion - 5/5  i love constant Motion its such a cool heavy progressive song! dream theater's metallica influence can clearly be heard on this song, but it is cool. i love the instromental section on this song. killer petrucci solo!    The Dark Eternal Night - 5/5  this is by far the heavyest song on the album. it has the style of TOT, but its more on the progressive side, and is done much better than TOT. The instromental section is sick! reminds me of dance of eternity! awsome song. one of the best on the album    Rependance - 5/5  a very moody more calm song. really well done vocal's. petrucci plays some tasty stuff on this song! reminds me of opeth's damnation. really cool track    Prophets Of War - 4/5  A good strange song. it is more straight folward than the other songs, and my least favorite from the album, but still a great song!     Ministry Of Lost Souls - 5/5  One of the highlights of the album! a great song with a great story to it. It has a scenes from a memory feel to it. very powerful synth useage. the 14 min epic song starts of very mellow, and eventlly transits into a heavy instromental section wich last quite a few mins. Petrucci plays a great damn Guitar solo! The song eventully transits into the emotional ending. and starts to fade off to john petrucci's amazing emotional catchy guitar line. mikes does some crazy drum fills over it.    In The Presense Of Enemies pt 2 - 5/5  part 2 of the epic is just as amazing as the first part. it starts off where the first left off. The track starts off calm and moody, and more vocal driven. It begins to built up, and it eventully builts to a verry proggy hard rock sound. than the song builts into a really heavy metal section, and the frighting instromental section kicks in for about 5 mins. That transists into the melodies from pt 1 of the song. and that conludes the song.    GREAT ALBUM!
0143038419|5.0|Eat Pray Love is one of the most entertaining books I've ever read.  An autobiographical story about one woman's journey back from the brink of a terrible divorce seems to touch upon many life themes most of which we can all relate to.  Gilbert's humanity and willingness to bare her soul - and everything else in her world - benefits all who take the time to read her life-altering work of literary art.  Gilbert's incredibly honest and conversational style makes some very abstract concepts she weaves expertly into the book easy for average folks like you and I to understand. It was so good, I sent copies to all my dear friends and read it twice myself within a four week period. Be ready to learn about yourself while enjoying every step of Gilbert's trips.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Typically every CD has a few songs which you don't like. This CD is the exception where EVERY SONG is a recognizable & delightfull hit. I had forgotten how strong the orchastration was on the 4 Seasons music. This is an outstanding CD.
B000UX6THK|5.0|My only regret is that I had already owned Seasons 1(Artisan release minus pilot) and 2...but I still bought this set.  The postcards are a nice touch.  The extra's are great, the picture is remastered, the sound is in 5.1, and most importantly, it's got the pilot episode (both US and International Versions!)    Any Twin Peaks fan should already own this by now, but if you don't:    1.  It IS worth the Double Dip  2.  Go out and buy it!  3.  Put it on your Christmas List!!!!
B00005JPS5|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed watching this with our 4 year old daughter and almost 2 year old son. The picture quality is excellent (very vivid and bright) which kept my son's attention. There were funny parts throughout the entire film. I thought the overall concept of the movie was great. I thought the voices were great and loved Renee Zellwegers character the best. I can't wait to buy it on DVD. Both of my kids really enjoyed it and now I will have something other than Curious George that my 2 year old can watch without getting bored. Can't wait to watch this movie again and again. Great for the whole family!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Excellent and timeless!  All ages will enjoy this movie.  The music and singing is beautiful, as well as the Victorian era theme.  A wonderful movie for all!  Margaret O'Brien, as \\"Tootie\\", is adorable!
B00005T30L|5.0|I finally saw Ghost World a couple years ago and it was one of the best things I've done for myself. Buying it on dvd shortly thereafter, I've been in love with it ever since. This and Bob Brozman's [[ASIN:B000GEIOEE Live in Germany]] (a concert dvd I know Seymour would love) are the dvds I've seen more than any others I own.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite American movies of my lifetime. I think it has a huge amount of depth... truth. It's a movie that stars 2 teens (or maybe early 20s at the time but their characters are teens) and a 40-something, but it's not a \\"teen movie\\" at all. I wish this is how \\"teen movies\\" are made. I think the USA could be a better place, were that the case. Instead, teen movies feature the dumb pop-tarts du jour and you're sure to see 1 of them walk or run into at least one glass door/wall during the commercial, tee-hee!! (puke!)!<br /><br />There are a million reasons and shadings of reason why I may or may not love, like or feel indifferent towards any given movie. The reasons for my love of Ghost World are simple... I relate in the most serious ways. Enid and Seymour are me split into both genders. Not in superficial ways... I don't dress like either one of them, I've never gotten the geeky/nerd/dork tag as has Seymour, but in the deeper aspects of the movie. There's no other movie I've seen where I feel like they took major parts of me and created 2 believable, heavy characters.<br /><br />Thora is brilliant here. Half the movie is about her eyes, what she says with them and when she says it. Watch her eyes when her and Rebecca talk of never seeing Dennis again. If you've never felt Enid's internal struggle of feeling somehow \\"alone\\" even around those with whom you are closest, then you're probably Melora. Then there's her first Skip James moment. I think that's how everyone feels their first time with him.<br /><br />With Enid (Thora), I relate internally. With Seymour, I relate more with his interests and what he comes right out and says.<br /><br />This is one of the ultimate \\"repeated viewings\\" movies. I bought the dvd before I'd seen the movie 3 times. I've seen it at least 35 times since buying it, and have never less than loved it. Some people seem to think it's quirky and entertaining but for me it has gotten deeper with every viewing. Some of the lines... some of the scenes... some of the looks... in its own way, it's a perfect movie.f the ultimate \\"repeated viewings\\" movies. I bought the dvd before I'd seen the movie 3 times.

B000F3UAFC|5.0|I've read the play and seen other versions, but this one is my favorite. The cast is superb. The details that were added to the story add to its charm. Helen Hunt is at her best. One of the very few times where the movie is better than the original story.

B000SFZ05C|2.0|One of my top 5 Bands.. Duffy/Astbury can play with the best of them...But Born Into this was a dissapointment....\\"Beyond Good & Evil\\" was an explosive record...Duffy was on fire from start to finish.. But he was missing in action on this one.. Ian's vocals were good.. The bass tracks were impressive .. But where was Billy???  My favorite tune is Sound Of Destruction..Old time classic Cult.. Citizens is a worth a listen ....The Title track Born into this is average and Dirty Little Rock Star could have been so much better..Tiger in the Sun & Assasin, Iluminated are decent songs. But notcomparable to the intensity and Cult recordings of the past...Rock should have produced this record.. ANd Billy should have showed up and played some blood curdling solos??  I saw them live last year in NYC they were incredible....Some people are comparing Born into this to \\"Ceremony\\"  Nonsense Ceremony is much better then Born into This.. Wild Hearted Sun, Earth Mofo ar e much more Cult power....Bottom line  When I heard Beyond Good & Evil a few years back for  the first time..It blew me away.. It was awesome from Start to finish.. Explosive recording.. I had to listen to Born Into this 10 times .. To even pick out a couple of tunes that I condisered just average.......A dissapointed fan But a Cult Fan for life!!!!!!!!!.. I hopy Duffy shows up for the next recording.. Hopefully within 24 months not 4 or 5 years!!
B000001DYY|5.0|I am a Tears Fan. I bought this one when it came out. I know Curt was gone. The songs contained in this CD I personally feel were the best Roland has every written. Very introspective and full of energy. Each song a commentary, some of it very hard edged and agressive. Great guitar work. A very strong, and underrated piece of work. It would only have been better had Curt contributed to the vocals. This is my favorite of all the Tears material, and I love all their stuff.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Lovely image, great sound, and what a show. It holds up well, seems to have hardly aged in the past 16 years. Still as weird and scary and wonderful as the first time I saw it. The only thing missing in this set, in my opinion, is a printed episode guide of some kind. Otherwise, worth every penny.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|The music makes up for any flaws in the picture. My oh my, how I love that opening, with the fly, the dripping water, and the wind. Bronson's harmonica is a treat, too, as are all the sounds effects. Fonda ia cold-hearted and wonderful; I hadn't remembered him as having been so slim. He walks very gracefully, with that marvelous cross-cutting. Leone must have noticed, too, because he is filmed from below to great effect. Robards is quirky, though not persuasively tough (he's too much the rogue), Claudia Cardinale is operatic and great, if not quite earthy, but Leone has this set up so that the land is the real star as it was for John Ford. I especially love the pacing which is excruciatingly slow for modern minds but just right for an old coot like me. Oddly enough, as good a movie as it is, it doesn't really have a good story. It is slow, predictable, and lacks real suspense, but it is epic, grand, operatic and memorable. Bravo.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I absolutely love them.  Heard them for the first time in So You Think You Can Dance and it was love at first sound.  I tried to see them in Annapolis and was unable to, but I just bought tickets to see them in DC...super excited!
B00005JPMZ|5.0|Great movie, except Michelangelo and Donatello are barely in the movie.  Their best scene was cut from the movie and put in the Deleted Scenes section.  It should have definately been left in.<br /><br />But the level of emotional conflict between Raphael and Leo was amazing.  This movie is a lot of fun for kids and also for the parent watching.
0375842209|5.0|THE BOOK THIEF is on of the most memorable books I've read in a long time. It takes place during World War II in Molching, Germany. It's the writing, the unusual narrator (death), and the characters sketched in vivid colors that make this novel so difficult to put down.<br /><br />Meet Leisel, the book thief, whose first encounter with death occurs on a train with her mama and brother - on their way to meet her foster parents.<br /><br />Meet Rosa Hubermann, Leisel's new mama, whose rough, crude exterior can't hide the heart inside.<br /><br />Meet Hans Hubermann, Leisel's firm foundation. The man who stays up with her after her nightmares, who teaches her to read her first stolen book, who finds empathy in a slice of stale bread.<br /><br />Meet Max, a Jew, the shadow in the basement, a skeleton later seen marching, or more aptly, stumbling, down the road.<br /><br />Meet Rudy, the lemon-haired Jesse Owens, Leisel's partner in crime and best friend, the one who yearns for Leisel's kiss.<br /><br />Meet the F&uuml;hrer, the invisible, potent master of words.<br /><br />Meet death, in a metal cockpit, on a snow-covered field mottled in red, hanging from a rafter at the end of a rope, sitting at a simple kitchen table, under a pile of rubble that used to be a home.<br /><br />Markus Zusak fills the reader with vivid images of humans at war, humans led to the unthinkable by a force they cannot control. Some go willingly, others have no choice. Those left behind are merely attempting to survive each day as life crumbles around them. Leisel survives by stealing books.<br /><br />As I read the final chapters of THE BOOK THIEF, I literally had to close the book to get my emotions under control before reading on to meet death. It was inevitable -- he would meet me at the end of the book. As I emerged from the story at the turning of the back cover, my reality felt so jarringly wrong. It was as though I went from a black and white silent movie to a new world: bright, free, and colorful. You cannot read this novel without feeling a resounding resolve that this should never, ever, happen again.<br /><br />The writing is incredible. Mr. Zusak gave death such an unusual perspective. His descriptive phrases are nothing short of brilliant. THE BOOK THIEF is a powerful read that should not be missed by anyone, teen or adult!<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Cana Rensbergerresolve that this should never, ever, happen again.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|Star Trek like you've never seen it.  The HD-DVD episodes are simply stunning.  Every fan should own these!  I do not really care for the \\"new\\" effects but the show itself is fabulous.  I'm not sure why the original effects were not included . . . I guess I will also have to buy the next HD-DVD release that has the original effects.  Oh well, even though it makes me mad; I guess that's the price of admission.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|I almost didn't see this movie when I saw that Will Ferrell was in it. But the plot sounded interesting enough for me to see it. Will Ferrell is so extroverted I did not see how he could play this part. So much for type casting, for Will Ferrell actually brought his character to life, Harold Crick. An IRS Auditor whose life is numbers. He wakes up one morning and hears his life is being narrated and he comes to realize that he has no control of his fate.    Maggie Gyllenhaal does a wonderful job as Ana Pascal, a baker that Harold Crick has to audit. Dustin Hoffman seemed to have fun playing Professor Jules Hilbert an expert of literature who knows that great literature lives on forever and gives advice to Harold. Queen Latifah plays the narrator's very professional assistant Penny Escher, which brings a great dynamic between her and Emma's character. Emma Thompson, playing a famed author who is actually writing a novel about Death and Taxes, is the narrator and her brilliance as an actor is obvious in this film.    There are many levels to this film; it is a drama that has some light moments, a tapestry of comedy and tragedy. The story is engaging and worth watching. To share more of the plot and the deeper meaning I found in it pertaining to life and literature I feel would ruin the first viewing pleasure of this film. The computer graphics interface that represents how Harold process information actually enhances the viewing pleasure without getting in way of the performance.  It also brought to mind a quote of John Lennon's; \\"Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.\\"  I will watch this movie filled with rich characters again.
0060888695|5.0|Best novel of the 20th century read by a great actress with a great voice for this story. To Kill a Mockingbird is, in my opinion, the quintessential and best novel for America in the 20th century. Sissy Spacek's reading of the story is wonderful in that her voice has just enough of a Southern twang and the little hoarseness that I associate, in my mind, with the main character -- Scout Finch (even though you could tell that she had a cold or allergies or something while reading this because there are a few parts where her voice is noticeably stuffy). I've read this story over and over for the last 30 years so I know it well but listening to Spaced read it aloud was a new way to enjoy my favorite booka nd film.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Certainly not as good as The Incredibles (which is my favorite Pixar film) but close to perfection.  It was hard getting past rats cooking (despite story line addressing the cleanliness issue)  but the story has heart, the animation is typical Brad Bird spectacular (he tells story through animated movement of his characters).  Great for kids and adults alike and if you enjoy food/cooking, this one will really be great for you.
0446577391|5.0|I had an early morning flight so I got home from a business meeting.  I was in the airport even before the papers arrived so I started Stone Cold which I had with me expecting to spend a few minutes before I turned to other matters.  Those matters will wait for tomorrow because I spent the entire day finishing this book.    It is just a great story.  The characters are so interesting.  Some of the action is telegraphed but it does not take away from the enjoyment.  Oliver Stone and the rest of his crew are just plain fun.      Baldacci had gotten a little preachy I think in his past few books but this was just great fun.
0767836286|5.0|Normally Jeff Bridges isn't one of my favorite actors but in this suspense he does a great job.  There's a couple small problems with the film.  The acting isn't up to standards by pretty much everyone except Jeff.  Seriously his wife (played by Hope Davis) sounds monotone and uninterested in her role, and the bad guy -his neighbor Tim Robbins who Jeff's suspects is part of an extremist group capable of blowing up homes and buildings- seems like the wrong choice for extremist guy because he's just too nice and mellow of a person.  Wrong choice!  Then again a nice mellow person would normally be the right choice based on the surprise factor, however when he gets angry later it doesn't seem believable enough.  Anyway the story is that Jeff and Tim get along really well... until Jeff suspects Tim isn't who he claims he is with a false name and troubled history as a teenager blowing stuff up.  And because Jeff's is a college professor who craves researching anything he can, he wants to dig up as much information on Tim as possible (even risking getting caught by Tim himself!) For most of the first half we see Tim and Jeff's family having normal conversations and being friendly neighbors, but eventually Jeff's snooping around catches up to him and Tim's true intentions are revealed.  However they're revealed in a way that really makes the storyline compelling.  Joan Cusack is Tim's REALLY fruity wife.  She's sort of hilarious in an unintentional kind of way how she comes across as unnaturally happy most of the time.  No this isn't because she's a happy house mom!  She's of course part of Tim's extremist plans but disguises it perhaps a little too well!  Speaking of unintentional humor, check out the way  Tim pushes Jeff around after Jeff's suspicions catch up to him, lol.  I think if Jeff really wanted to retaliate he'd be the aggressive one, but I could be wrong!  It's surprising seeing Jeff getting pushed around like he was.    Anyway there's a HUGE surprise at the end.  Wow I didn't see that coming at all!  I won't spoil it though.  I will say Jeff's wife and son play a part in the main chunk of the story.  Tim becomes obsessed with Jeff's son and insists that the boy come along on a scouting trip with Tim and his family based on how well the boy accepts this family, but of course Jeff doesn't want his son to go anywhere as his suspicions get more intense.  This results in some disagreements and fighting between Jeff and his son.    Also, and this isn't a spoiler because it's based on an event that happened in the past, be prepared for a VERY intense segment that shows FBI agents in the woods trying to track down an extremist hiding in his house.  They first stumble upon the young son of the extremist who happens to be walking by the FBI agents after a fishing trip home, which results in a really crazy shootout a moment later.  Crazy indeed!    Oh and too bad about Hope being in the wrong place and wrong time.  What are the odds!  Never should have made that call!  Plus the aspect of whether Jeff is imagining his neighbors intentions or whether it's just Jeff being increasingly anxious comes into the story which is nice.  These are clearly the best moments between Hope and Jeff.  I love the atmosphere and growing feeling of concern during these parts that a bombing is going to happen, all the while Tim across the street is probably overhearing and enjoying all of it.  This is a 5-star movie.  You can tell this is a 1999 film just the way the story develops and the way the entire cast give their acting performances.  I never thought that year would ever become dated but well, it has.   While the acting isn't particularly impressive, the storyline contains enough suspense and twists that should leave viewers satisfied.
B000WZB944|5.0|FINALLY a remastering of the FULL version of (check and laugh at my review of U2's last compilation U218 Singles) \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\"!!!!! This is what I have been waiting for for a looooooong time!    This anniversary edition was WAAAAAAY overdue but it's finally here and worth buying right away! It's a specially great gift for those people who are not complete die hards of U2 but definitely like this album; and the b-sides make a perfect collateral to show that you didn't just buy the 'cheapskate' single-cd version.    As for the reviews here lambasting this cd. What did this album EVER do to you?? If you know even a little BIT of Bono you will know how he reveres those groups that you say are better. He will be the FIRST to admit that you are absolutely right, and I'm sure that he will call Joshua Tree an awful record compared to those!!    Still, his humility and your hate aside. This IS a landmark album. This is the only album I can recommend to anyone, independently of their music tastes, heritage, cultural or national background. This is an honest to God CLASSIC album that marked not only an epoch but also retains its universality across time. Just like those other awesome groups and albums you mentioned!    So don't get mad! Thank the heavens we live in a world where we have the liberty to have and hear so many awesome records that can be and are in fact loved by some many people across the world!    ROCK ON!!!
B000MG1ZFQ|5.0|It's always been a BIG mystery to me why so many people are convinced the Soft Parade is the weakest of the six classic Jim Morrison Doors albums.  To me, the songwriting is *just* as good as it has always been.  I can't figure out what the problem is with all the negative opinions.  A very solid and enjoyable Doors album.     \\"Tell All the People\\" has a melody very similar to \\"Touch Me\\", and it boggles the mind why \\"Touch Me\\" continues to receive all the classic rock radio play when it's not even the best song on the album.  Sure, the horns are great, and the vocal melody is really beautiful, but it's NOT the best song on the album.      \\"Shaman's Blues\\" might be the very best song on the album.  It's a blues song with a special mystical-like atmosphere.  Plus it's just an exciting song.  I love it.  \\"Do It\\" has a chorus for a vocal melody and a guitar riff repeating for only a couple minutes.  \\"Wild Child\\" has a chugging blues riff.  It's a highly memorable track as well.  You know, the whole album feels really good because it's so exciting and electric and mystical.  Great stuff.      What would a Doors album be without a spooky chilling Jim Morrison vocal melody?  That's what \\"Wishful Sinful\\" is for!      You won't hear rock music like this anymore.  Oh, and the title song is over eight minutes of jamming, and not much atmosphere (which is what separates it from stuff like \\"The End\\" and \\"When the Music's Over\\").  It's more musically focused in comparison.  Overall, a very solid effort.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I'm too young to remember Hepburn or Peck in their movie-making days, and I'm too modern to enjoy many black and white films. Often times, movies of that era have a certain stiltedness in the acting, or a clear use of sets and backdrops which I find distracting.<br /><br />\\"Roman Holiday\\" was a pleasant surprise. Not only is the film shot on location in Italy, giving it a realism and vibrancy missing from many movies of that period, it is also written with a sensibility for dialogue and character development that still rings true, for the most part.<br /><br />A pampered, but overburdened princess, Audrey Hepburn's character is about to have a breakdown. She wants so much to experience life as a normal person that she decides to escape one night, during her entourage's visit to Rome, the Eternal City. Still suffering the effects of a sleep aid from her doctor, she finds herself on the streets late at night and in the arms of Gregory Peck, a conniving and penniless reporter. Peck realizes he has stumbled upon the story of a lifetime. Even as he conceals his purpose from the princess, she tries to conceal her identity from him, in hopes of enjoying the city life as a commoner.<br /><br />Although the story has no major twists, it uses its simple devices to great effect, for humor and romance. I think the acting and casting is brilliant, and I felt a chemistry between the two leads that resonates through the final bittersweet scenes. This is a timeless romance, and one I'm sorry I didn't pay attention to earlier. Hepburn deserves her place as an icon, and Peck is a worthy foil for her charm and beauty.
B00004U2G4|5.0|I didn't believe it at first, but yeah, Jeff Beck's \\"Truth\\" is a really good groundbreaking album.  It mixes blues, hard rock and some boogie rock elements together to create a very satisfying listen.  This version of \\"Shapes of Things\\" is pretty different compared to the Yardbird's version, because Rod Stewart has his own sound and style.  It's not better, but it's certainly not any worse.      This version of \\"Morning Dew\\" is *much* better than Nazareth's version from their debut album (released two years later).  That version dragged, whereas the version here is shorter and features some excellent and innovative guitar playing.  I also think this version of \\"You Shook Me\\" (dominated with keyboards) blows Zeppelin's version to pieces.  It's the same story with the previous song- Zeppelin's version from the first album DRAGS and a shorter version is a big improvement in my opinion, so that's why I prefer this one.    \\"Greensleeves\\" is an odd choice, but it's short and harmless, \\"Beck's Bolero\\" has a catchy and snappy little guitar riff, and \\"Blues Deluxe\\" is a fantastic blues song.  Maybe it's equal to Led Zeppelin's \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\".  I love Rod's vocals and of course the guitar work totally blows my mind.      Is \\"Truth\\" a classic?  Yes.  It's no Blow By Blow or Wired (my two favorite Beck albums) but third place ain't a bad place to be.

It is simply amazing to hear the inventiveness with which the musicians and singers went about reworking Beatles' tunes without losing a bit of their melody, harmony, lustre, charm, beauty.  I get chills and often feel a huge wave of emotion when listening to these tracks.  I think you should try it sooner than later and you'll find that you CAN get by with a little help from your friends.  Ta
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|A young and fetching Patty O'neil, matched with the handsome Gary Cooper. Great little docu. in special features that brings the movie even closer to heart.  The two had a \\"thing\\" while making the film which I think you see on camera. Great sets and loved the script and was and am an Ann Rand fan since. (Nice Sentence). Love Old films and Zombies. This is a classy movie that is fun to watch, and yes campy. Maybe zany at times but the acting and the script brings you back. I guess it touches me because the theme is so very timeless. We are still individuals selling ourselves out to the great corporate monster, forced to compromise and thus sacrificing our integrety. I do it every day. It makes me sad. I'm over it now but a great price neverless for this gem.

B00000IGGA|5.0|I was first introduced to Tom Waits on the Dead Man Walking CD.  When I listened to DMW I often skipped his music.  One day I finally listened and there began my love affair.  And, yet even knowing I was listening to a large talent I didn't buy any of his CD's for several years.  He was a little edgy on Dead Man Walking and I really thought a full CD might be too much.  Was I wrong.  I've only had Mule Variations for a few days and can't stop listening to it.  His songs continue to resonate in my head when I'm not listening to his work.  What a talent.  Tom when are you coming to Tucson???   I want to see you live... and how about some DVD's?     I recommend this CD ...you won't be disappointed.

B000002GFC|5.0|Before going any further with this review I want you to just stop and look at everything that is in the room you are currently in. Even if you're not at home and you're on your laptop just look at everything that is in your view. Don't judge it. Just look at everything with a kind of detached attitude. Just observe everything that is in your sight and acknowledge that it is a part of your life. You put it there. You created it.<br /><br />Common sense will tell you this is true. If it wasn't part of your life, it wouldn't be there. But it is there and that is why it's in your life at the moment...<br /><br />\\"Uh, this is all very well and good, but what does this have to do with anything? I just came here to decide if whether or not I should buy the Very Best of Cream...\\"<br /><br />Oh, my friend, it has everything to do with it. Because at this very moment you are about to make a decision that will affect your entire life and the lives of everyone on the planet. We are all interconnected. we are all One. What affects the individual, affects the collective.<br /><br />\\"Dude, you are trippin' me out. I just wanna buy a flippin' CD...\\"<br /><br />Of course you do...on a human level of things...but on a soul level, you want to buy something that you think will contribute to your overall enjoyment of Life. You think - and correctly, I might add - that this CD will cause you to feel good and when you feel good, you send these good feelings out into the universe affecting every single one of us.<br /><br />Now, go back to the things that you observed in the room you are in. You created everything that is in your life up to this moment. You let certain things become a part of your existence. Even if you live in a room full of Salvation Army furniture, you let these things become a part of your life and if just one thing were different, you'd be different, and if you were different, the world would be, as well.<br /><br />All of these tiny pieces, all these miniscule moments go into the making of a Whole and Holy Life.<br /><br />You're pretty darn amazing, man, you are one heck of a creator.<br /><br />So, now you want to get this CD. You're mulling it over in your mind. You or deciding if whether or not you should spend the money on yourself or on your Aunt Bess. Afterall, it is the Holiday Season. But then again, Aunt Bess has Alzheiner's. She thinks she's a tuna sandwich. Her mind is gone, man. You know it...I know it. Just give her a rock. Tell her it's from an African Priestess and that it will increase her libido. She won't know.<br /><br />C'mon, it's Christmas...give the poor woman some hope!<br /><br />So you go in the backyard and find a rock and then you go back online and order the Very Best of Cream. You order it because has some incredible music on it. You order it because the magical happened when Jack Bruce, Eric Clapton, and Ginger Baker kept their Divine Appointment with destiny and created timeless music that awakens the mind, stirs the spirit, and frees the heart.<br /><br />You know that Badge, Crossroads, Sunshine Of Your Love, I Feel free, and the Tales of Brave Ulysses' are not just classic 60s soundtracks, they are songs that the rock 'n roll gods breathed new life into causing music to roll back the stoneand ascend from the dead.<br /><br />\\"Oh, man...I gotta get this!\\"<br /><br />Of course you do, dude. Of course you do.<br /><br />And in a few days, your Aunt will have her magic rock and you also will have Magic Rock. It will absorb itself into the very atoms of your existence causing you to feel lighter and happier and more at peace and not only will your life will change, but the entire world will, as well.<br /><br />And it's all because you bought this incredible CD.<br /><br />Can't you feel it, man? Wars will stop, peace will reign, love will reconnect us with Mother Earth and Father Sky, the stars will realign with the forces of good all because you bought this CD instead of that stupid ugly aqua-blue sweater you saw at the Salvation Army for your Aunt Bess. I, on behalf of the entire universe, thank you for such a wise, life altering decision.<br /><br />Rock on....<br /><br />Peace & Blessings, everyone!<br /><br />John, \\"the Light Coach\\"ng decision.    Rock on....    Peace & Blessings, everyone!    John, \\"the Light Coach\\"

B000MR9D5E|4.0|There is only one thing this DVD is missing: alternate languages.  It's only available in English language as of today (although it has Spanish and French subtitles).  I will deliver this as a present for my father, who only speaks spanish, but the whole enjoyment of the DVD collection might only be perfect if the narrative for the film is available in his native language.    Other than that, perfect picture of nature in the world.

I heard that they're quite famous in their native country.<br /><br />Notoriously and obviously influenced by Classic Pop stars as Simon & Garfunkel, a little bit of Cat Stevens and perhaps Donovan. However the result is such a soft and nice music, excellent for a quiet car ride, a lazy Sunday morning with a good cup of coffee and the news while lying in your most comfortable couch, or even sharing a special moment with your loved one... A good choice for a nice Christmas gift!

0060555661|5.0|Take your time to read this book.     I am new to the investing discipline, but I found this book a comprehensive, well-written, and helpful overview of the knowledge that is required to make sound investments.     The tone is 'text-book'-like, so really pay attention and don't rush through pages and chapters.     I already plan to read this book again because there's so much to be learned.     It is truly remarkable that most of Graham's principles from the 1950s are still relevant today. Don't get swayed by the overblown hype of CNBC, Fox Business, CNNfn, etc. You can make long-term, profitable decisions once you have the knowledge that's throughout this book.     Definitely worth the money.     Dan Naden
B000W4HJ44|5.0|This musical version is not the John Waters' original. It isn't the Broadway version either. So what? This version is it's own special creation. And a whole lot of fun.     John Waters' irreverence and crude humour are still there. This ain't High School Musical 2, kids. It's supposed to be offensive (just a bit under the radar.) Expect CAMP!     My only caveat is that Harvey Fierstein really should have played Edna. He has that crass spirit and pathos that the divine Divine had. (And Harvey is a better actor than John Travolta... in or out of that fat suit.)    Being a HUGE John Waters fan, I did not expect to like this film, but it won me over after the first song. You may not agree; but I love it!
0380804557|5.0|This book was just adorable.  I read it with fascination.  It tells the story of a young man who grows into a Dad who has a son who goes off to find his destiny in the Faerie Lands.  So fun and fresh and innocent.  A greast book for ALL ages, young and old will love the enchanting qualities.
0743455967|4.0|A good portion of this book is spent getting the reader caught up to speed in how King became successful.  Even though he writes that this book is not an autobiography, about half of the book certainly sounds like it.  He starts out by describing his childhood, his first jobs, and eventually leads into how his first major success, Carrie, came to be.<br /><br />The most I got out of this book is that you have to write because you want to, and that you should do it effectively.  I laughed at how blunt King noted our use of the passive tense and how it hardly gets us anywhere.  Who wants to read a passive story?  That sounds boring.  Also, King stressed that wordiness is a killer.  Adverbs are not your friends and should be used sparingly (haha).  Just say what you mean.  Don't worry about offending anyone because if you do, they probably shouldn't be reading your stories in the first place.<br /><br />Stephen King writes this book how he would write any other.  His foul mouth flows through the ink of his pen.  So, if you are offended by that sort of thing or if you are one of those people that would never read Stephen King, then read some other book on writing.  I guarantee you it will bore you a thousand times more than this book does.<br /><br />Seriously, there are a few chapters in this book that are helpful for aspiring writers.  Take a look at this memoir if you have time.

B000GPIPSS|5.0|This is a goldmine for Dracula fans, who can get the original Lugosi classic, the very interesting -- and in some ways superior -- Spanish version filmed along with the English version, and a nice selection of short subjects about Universal studios, Lugosi, and classic horror films in general. A great value.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|Gad, Annie still has it! She wrote all this music and it is just classic Annie Lennox: the passion, the vocal range...phenomenal. There is only one song that I don't love as much as the rest, (\\"Sing\\") but the rest I just crank my sound in my car and ROCK OUT.

If you don't feel loving toward your partner, but want to....READ THIS BOOK!
B00006JIA4|4.0|I do not have much to say about this, really.  Just that my long held opinion that Freddie Mercury had the greatest voice in the history is once again verified by this set.  George Micheal and Elton John are rock greats, with voices as good as anyone.  But listen to the Mercury versions then the ones by John and Micheal and you will see they do not even come close.  Mercury's range and power have never been equaled.  I gave this set 4 stars because I could never give anything Queen (with Freddie) has done less.  But, like many of the other reviews, I recommend picking up other Queen stuff.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|I have a soft spot for this album because it was the first ZZ Top album I ever heard. A buddy of mine turned me on to it when it was their new release back in the day. I still have it on vinyl and just ordered this Rhino remaster. This is the ZZ Top I prefer, not the ZZ Top of 'Legs' or 'Sharp Dressed Man' even though I do like those songs. Their sound got a little too slick for my taste. This album has a rawness to it that I love and there isn't a bad track here. Great guitar tone from Billy and he tears it up, especially on Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers. And of course the Top classic 'La Grange' is here. This album SHOULD be a part of any ZZ Top collection.
0393327655|5.0|Ever wonder why people kill in the name of religion?  This book is very clear about the why.  The first chapter is a bit difficult to read as he is a bit defensive educated snob but that changes as he sites their passages that makes it clear that if you are a Christian, Muslim, or Jew, you should kill anyone who is not of your religion. And you should also kill anyone if they are of your religion but they say something nice about any of the other religions.  Religion is based on fear and hate. Most will quickly deny this and say it is based on love.  But this \\"love\\" is killing people in the name of \\"their\\" god. Bullies learned centuries ago that you manipulate the masses with fear, lies, and intimidation.  This can be physically or with abstract ideas.  I am for peace inside me and in the world.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|THE MIGHTY LED ZEPPELIN     What more can ANYBODY say about the GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BAND IN THE WORLD. The rerelease of SONG REMAINS THE SAME with the added songs makes the Zep catalog complete. The package DOES suck BUT they could have put it in a brown paper bag and it would have been OK with me. The DVD's are awesome and the extras are cool. It's the music that blows me away. After all these years, LED ZEPPELIN does not sound dated like alot of other bands from the 70's do. I can't help but think if the great JOHN BONHAM would have lived what LED ZEPPELIN would have sounded like in the 21st century. The live version of DAZED AND CONFUSED on this DVD is worth the price alone. I hope Jimmy Page finds more live preformances in his private vault so the world can see why LED ZEPPELIN remains the GREATEST band to ALL generations.............................................
0375847227|4.0|I have to laugh at all the \\"reviews\\" by people who are fearful of a book/film they haven't even read or seen.  Minions of the Authority, perhaps?  LOL!!    Pullmans lyricism and story are fascinating.  Second parts of trilogies have a tendency to drag, and this one is no different, but the story still advances and the third book brings a resoundingly successful climax.
0440238609|1.0|I tried getting past the first half and simply lost interest.  I don't think Pullman is a very good writer.  So I didn't finish and don't plan to.  If this is the best of the 3 books then don't bother.  With so much out there to read, I decided not to waste time on this one. Now that I see that the end has to do with battling armored polar bears, I am glad I jumped ship.

B000Q6GUW0|4.0|[[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Dexter - The First Season]]  Dexter, the First Season is one of the most interesting, bizarre, sick, twisted, amazing shows that I've seen in a long time. The character development of Dexter is interesting to see, as this serial killer who kills serial killers appears to start to have actual feelings. His whole life, he's been faking it, with the skills his adopted father taught him.   This show leaves you feeling something each time, sometimes its just pure entertainment, but more often, you are left with a gut reaction of repulsion or sorrow, but always wanting more. The only thing I would say is that if you're watching multiple episodes back to back, you need a sorbet before going to bed, otherwise the dreams you may have are completely whacked.   I can't wait for Season Two.

B0000033P0|5.0|ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! Whoa, I know I'm in the vast minority when I say that. But this is their best album, by far! These guys were among rock's many talented bands. Keith Emerson was the best keyboardist, Greg Lake among the best on bass AND vocals, Carl Palmer among the best drummers. It's unfortunate that they were so inconsistent. Among all the prog rock bands their high points were the highest & their low points the lowest. This, along with Brain Salad Surgery, is their most consistent album. Tarkus, which was an entire side on the LP, is an exhilarating ride from start to finish. Tarkus, to me, is their definitive song. The only weak points are \\"Jeremy Bender\\", a musical whimsy, & \\"Are You Ready, Eddy\\", a fiftyish-rock throwaway homage to their engineer. Compare this to weak moments on their other albums & you'll see what I mean, this is their MOST consistent effort. The only thing this album is missing is the usual mainstream ballad penned by Greg Lake. This, then, was their formula; epic centerpiece, top-40 ballad & a whimsical ditty. ELP is at their finest here, don't cheat yourself by missing out.

B000006UD8|4.0|Machine Head is the definitive Deep Purple album. I bought this version because of the remix disc. This album has Deep Purple's three most well known songs: \\"Smoke on the Water\\" (the most recognizable riff in rock), \\"Highway Star\\" & \\"Space Truckin'\\". This band is certainly one of the most gifted that was ever in existence. Ian Gillian is one of rock's best vocalist; Richie Blackmore is one of rock's greatest guitarists; Jon Lord, Ian Paice & Roger Glover are right up there, also.    My focus is on the remix disc which is the point of this edition. On here we get what Roger Glover refers to as being the versions that should've been released. There are alternate leads on the three main songs which I found to be better than on the original mixes. You get to hear longer intros and different endings. The only other song I really enjoy listening to is \\"Lazy\\". Machine Head is a very good album whichever version you get. Along with Led Zeppelin IV & Black Sabbath, Vol. 4, this stands as blueprint for hard rock that many other bands would follow. This is a testament to just how good these guys were.
0316067598|5.0|'Lone Survivor' by Marcus Luttrell & Patrick Robinson<br /><br />War hero, Marcus Luttrell, recounts Operation Redwing, a special operation in Afghanistan involving 4 Navy SEALs on a mission to kill or capture a prominent Taliban terrorist.  Luttrell is the eponymous 'Lone Survivor', the one member of the 4 immensely brave SEALs to survive the mission, compromised by much more than simple battlefield tactics, as you'll read.<br /><br />The story is told in the no-nonsense, straightforward, barracks language voice of Luttrell.  Pretty it isn't - honest and smart it is.  You'll find much more than pure battlfield memories; the mini-bio's of Luttrell's 3 hyper-brave Navy SEAL comrades; the fascinating contrast between the culture of indigenous Afghani tribes and the loyalties and respect for code that these peoples live by.  Enjoy this book - you'll find it difficult to put down.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|On his own, David Gilmour takes a somewhat different direction than the band (Pink Floyd) he plays for. In general, The Pink Floyd albums are stronger than his solo stuff. This is a very mellow album & I kept waiting for Gilmour to take off on one of his dynamic, trademark leads, but it never happens. David Gilmour is a great guitarist, his leads are some of the most perfectly phrased efforts in the business. I'm a guitarist myself &, believe me, it's  impossible to improve on anything he does. He's that good. The only songs that stand out, in my mind, are \\"Take a Breath\\" & \\"This Heaven\\". Like most of Pink Floyd's music, David Gilmour pursues a mood-setting tone that rarely becomes intrusive. It's good music that's conducive to meditation. One would think, after waiting  24 years since his last solo effort (& only two Pink Floyd albums in there) that there would be a better selection of songs than this.     On an Island actually made it #6 on the charts, his best showing of all three solo albums he has released. One single made it to the charts, \\"On an Island\\" made it #29.     The album opens with the overture \\"Castellorizon\\", it's an instrumental that has passages from most of the songs from the album. Next is the single \\"On an Island\\" which isn't a standout song. Then comes \\"The Blue\\" which is a dreamy type of song but nothing special. \\"Take a Breath\\" is next & is one of the two best songs on the album. The song has an edgy feel to it. It's one of the few songs that has a good lead by Gilmour. \\"Red Sky at Night\\" is an instrumental, it has a sax solo in it which makes it feel similar to a Pink Floyd effort but not exactly. \\"This Heaven\\" has a bluesy feel to it & is one of the best songs here. The lyrics have a definite spiritual feel to them. Gilmour does some good leads on this one, in fact, it's the only one that you feel like it's the old Gilmour. \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" starts off with somewhat of an oriental feel, then does some things that Floyd would do. It'smellow in general but just an average song. \\"Smile\\" is another weak song on the album. It's unfortunate but it's this sort of song that reveals the limitations of Gilmour's vocals. \\"A Pocketful of Stones\\" is anotger average mellow song, this time piano based. \\"Where We Start\\" closes out the album. It's almost as good as \\"Take a Breath\\" & \\"This Heaven\\". This song is a little more typical for Gilmour & he gives us a respectale lead in this one. I'm used to Gilmour giving his best leads on the final song of the album, things that soar & reminds us just how good he is, doesn't happen here.     Of his three solo albums this probably the second best one. It's so mellow, though, you wonder if it's time to go to bed. Music for Insomniacs is the way we would have described this many years ago. Nothing wrong with the music, don't get me wrong, it's just the kind of stuff that I wouldn't put on until bedtime.
B00006879E|1.0|The only thing Maroon 5 prove on this debut album is that listeners of pop radio are hungry for \\"rock,\\" or at least any alternative to the hip-hop and r&b that dominate radio station playlists these days; otherwise, there's really not much to explain the popularity of either the group or this album. The songs are an uninspired mix of pop-rock and the brand of r&b/soul that Prince perfected in the early 80s. And while the band themselves seem to have quite a bit of talent, occasionally latching onto a funky, good-time vibe that would sound right at home in a rock-oriented dance club (if there even is such a thing), any enjoyment that might come from the music is swallowed in the screeching of Adam Levine's voice and the vapid idiocy of the lyrics. It's not that Levine's singing is uninteresting, as is often the case in these times of cookie-cutter bands and lowest-common-denominator, reality TV-born pop stars, it's that his wail is beyond irritating and begins to grate on the nerves by the second line of the first verse of the first track. Be careful not to play this disc above the 2nd or 3rd volume marker, or Levine's caterwaul may pierce your eardrums, causing blood to leak from your ears, destroying your favorite shirt. And heaven forbid the neighbors hear you playing this, or you can surely expect a visit from your local animal control officer, inquiring about mutilated felines. All in all, Maroon 5 fall right into line with such acts as the Goo Goo Dolls and Matchbox 20-- bands whose great fortune it is that their frontman is easy enough on the eyes that the ladies swoon without caring in the least what type of noise is coming from their speakers. If this is the type of \\"rock\\" that pop radio programmers and listeners are willing to accept as catchy and cutting-edge, then it's no wonder that radio seems to be going the way of the dinosaur. And, despite the damage to my eardrums, I can't help but admire Adam Levine for parlaying his pretty smile and discernible lack of talent into a genuine career on the hit parade.    If you want modern, radio-ready rock, try Jimmy Eat World or Hoobastank. If you like the band's funky vibe, go for 311, Incubus, or Red Hot Chili Peppers. Or go old school and dig out some Prince. Or go really old school and break out the James Brown.

But alas, I picked it up and read it from front to back as soon as I could, nothing short of LOVING it and being very pleasantly surprised.

B000VWYNNW|4.0|As far as \\"real,\\" faithful, organic performances go, this album is even more of a travesty than the original album was.    Not only is the music not from one show (it's from three different ones), but every song is either cut, overdubbed, spliced together from more than one performance, or a combination thereof.    In fact, most of the songs are composites from at least two of the three performances. (Please see thegardentapes.co.uk for more information.)    Still, at least two of the songs on the original album are my favorite versions of those songs, studio versions included. \\"No Quarter\\" and \\"The Rain Song\\" have never sounded better to me, and I've heard bootleg versions from the same tour as well as from the 1975 and 1977 tours.    I'm really glad that the current edition of the album includes additional tracks--very good ones (however much tinkered with in the studio)--because the original album always felt gutted to me. The current edition sounds more like a complete show than an abbreviated one.    But I do wish that Page had just remastered the songs that were originally on the album instead of altering them for the new edition. I find it very hard to listen to the new \\"No Quarter\\" because it actually sounds edited, as does \\"Whole Lotta Love.\\"    I realize that the current album is meant to perfectly accompany the visuals of the film and that Page has no rights to the film. But why would a musician sacrifice his music to a film? Especially when there's such a lack of officially released live performances?? And he's proud of how his band played on stage???    I also wonder why Page didn't just buy the film rights and then shape the visuals to fit the music. Surely, cash wasn't a problem.     I hope he decides one day to issue untinkered-with 3CD sets of great 1975 and 1977 shows. To have the April 27, 1977, Cleveland show ('Destroyer') in complete, well-mastered form would be a tremendous addition to the Zep canon. Its song selection and performances leave nothing to be desired.    Unless, of course, you're Mr. Page and hear everything with studio ears :)
0312330537|3.0|The interesting story is the author himself, of course (who wrote from his experience). Although some of the writing and philosophy (of the author via his characters) are annoying or even embarrassing, in all the story is very good, the reading goes quickly, and you are in fact transported to another culture -- with a view that you would probably never have. Roberts is talented without being a great writer. I'd still recommend.
0439882826|5.0|Robert Sabuda and his protégé, Matthew Reinhart, have brought pop-up books back into the mainstream, not only as concept and novelty books for very young children but as genuine works of art and engineering. Their wonderful creations attract readers of all ages, and many a Sabuda/Reinhart project has found its way to coffee tables alongside glossy art books. Reinhart's latest solo effort, STAR WARS: A POP-UP GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, is another such project that will find an audience not only among young readers but also among aficionados of paper engineering and, most importantly, nostalgic adult fans of the Star Wars franchise who will revel in this volume, timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the first Star Wars film.    Reinhart, like many adults his age, was raised on the Star Wars mythology, and his knowledge of and appreciation for the Star Wars universe is apparent through the details he integrates into his paper creations, as well as in his dedication \\"to the visionary artists of STAR WARS, who fashioned a wondrous, distant galaxy with words, paint, clay, sound, and celluloid, inspiring generations of young artists around the world.\\" The text itself is rich, dense, detailed and filled with the facts, figures and history of the fantastic world George Lucas created.    The book focuses primarily on the characters and events of the three original Star Wars movies, although certain elements of the mythology do come from Episodes 1-3. Topics for the two-page spreads include the geography of the galaxy, discussions of the galaxy's social and political structures, descriptions of vehicles, the history of conflicts between the Rebels and the Empire, and Luke Skywalker's story. Since this is more of an encyclopedic guide rather than a storybook, the text does not focus on any single storyline or tell a unified narrative. Instead, it assumes its readers already know the films' plotlines and fills in the details on everything from the origins of the criminal underworld to the technical specifications of R2-D2 and C-3PO.    The design of STAR WARS: A POP-UP GUIDE TO THE GALAXY will be familiar to fans of Reinhart's and Sabuda's other projects, particularly the Encyclopedia Prehistorica series. Each two-page spread consists of a large pop-up feature at its center (examples include the Millennium Falcon and a menacing Darth Vader mask), as well as several smaller, text-heavy foldout \\"mini books\\" on a certain theme, each of which may also contain one or more smaller pop-up constructions. These nested \\"books within a book\\" result in an unusually rich, interactive reading experience that will keep fans young and old poring over the pages for hours.    The advertised highlights of the illustrations are Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker's working lightsabers, which turn on when their mini-books are opened. As Yoda would say, though, \\"Patient you must be\\" --- the lightsabers in my review copy took a good 10-15 seconds to light up after the page was opened.    STAR WARS: A POP-UP GUIDE TO THE GALAXY is a tour de Force --- the perfect gift idea for fans, no matter what their age.       --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl
B000WGZGNS|5.0|Entertain me!  That she did!!!  This DVD was well worth my money.  Beyonce is an amazing talent, the girl works hard for her money.  She's got the energy of Tina Turner with the glamour of Diana Ross.  I loved that the Destiny Child's girls, Kelli and Michelle join her for a minute, during this concert; it remids you of her roots and reminds you that Beyonce is a Diva, but the group catapulted her to the fame she now enjoys. Everything she got, she deserves and I believe she's going to be right up there in the legend of her own time category, along with Michael Jackson and emerging talent, Chris Brown.

B000YAF4OS|5.0|Stephen King adaptations are funny. There are some really good ones out there (Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, 1408)... some that are good but are in turn nothing like the books they were based on (Kubrick's The Shining) and some that are well... horrible (Pet Sematary, Dreamcatcher, Children of the Corn).  The Mist falls into the first category.  It's right up there as being one of the best.  It is not as good as any of the movies listed as being the good ones above (Shawshank is still the best of them all), but it's really good.<br /><br />After a freak storm in a small Maine town, the denizens must find a way to rebuild and reconstruct.  David Drayton (Thomas Jane) and his son Billy (Nathan Gamble) decide to go to the store with friend Brent Norton (played by Andre Braugher).  Because of the storm, the power is out all over town, but what's really strange is that there's a mist ebbing closer and closer.<br /><br />At the store, the mist gets closer.  A screaming man eventually comes into the store, warning that there's something in the mist.  Something inhuman.  He's got all the qualities of a guy who barely escaped death.  He's panicked, out of breath and he's bleeding.  Some crazed religious woman named Mrs. Carmody (played extremely well by Marcia Gay Harden) warns that its death out there.  No one wants to leave for a moment.  And then a man tries to and the mist envelopes him and he screams such a horrid scream.  The people are now scared to leave.  David decides to go to the back and check on the backup generator and then he hears something.  He comes out of the back room panicked.  The others don't believe he heard anything because he, like everyone else, is a little on edge.  So they go to check.  Dave heads back with Jim (played by William Sadler--who actually showed up in The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption... Darabont must like him), Ollie (Toby Jones), Norm (Chris Owen) and Myron (David Jensen).  David continues to warn them that something is out there in the mist.  Norm volunteers to go out there and clear some of the mist surrounding the generator.  When they lift the shutter everything looks fine at first, until a tentacle slithers in and grabs Norm.  The other men try to rescue him, only to fail and Norm is dragged off into the mist right before their very eyes.  It's a gruesome sight and particularly bloody.<br /><br />No one believes the returning men when they tell them about it.  More people go out into the mist and die.  Mrs. Carmody eventually begins preaching that its the end of days come.  When they finally show the store manager that there really is something out there (because there's a piece of tentacle lying on the ground along with Norm's blood) they decide to hold off in the store as long as possible.  But of course, Mrs. Carmody doesn't believe it'll do anything.  When cabin fever sets in and Mrs. Carmody starts to be right about a few things... the people who once thought she was crazy now start to think she's right.  Because they, like many of us when faced with the unknown, want answers, and she seems to have them.  Pretty soon people begin pointing fingers and trying to find someone to blame for the mist.  And pretty soon they begin trying to find people to sacrifice.  The store becomes divided between those who support David and those who support Mrs. Carmody.  But David and his supporters are outnumbered.  And pretty soon the real focus isn't the monsters, but which is worse.  Being trapped in a store with people who have gone mad... or venturing out into the mist full of monsters?  Either way, David and his supporters all run the risk of being killed.  Either by the monsters in the mist... or killed by people who have gone crazy.<br /><br />The reason The Mist works so well is not because of the monsters but because of the characters trapped in the market.  All of them are played believably well.  The fear of the movie doesn't come from the monsters either, but rather comes from the human reactions to the events.  If Saw and Hostel were your cup of Tea, then The Mist is a very different film indeed.<br /><br />In terms of writing, there's nothing to stark here.  Most of the dialog spoken from the characters is ripped directly from the book.  And it manages to be good.  While the portions dealing with the monsters are far between, it's quite clear the movie wasn't meant to be about them.<br /><br />The only problem with Darabont's movie, really, is the ending.  Is it a good ending?  Yes.  Will it draw a lot of emotion from you?  Sure.  Will you like it?  There's a divide there.  More than likely you won't.  It is certainly far different from the original ending King had.  I personally did not like the ending but that does not make it a BAD ending.  But if how good an ending is is judged by the reaction, then Darabont has more than likely made a good one.  I will not give it away.  But it IS an ending that could change how much you like or dislike the movie.<br /><br />The Mist is a pretty good film.  A nice departure from where horror genre is.  This is not torture porn, nor is it a massacre filled with blood and guts all over.  It's a movie filled with human emotion and reaction.  If you're looking for a bloodbath of a movie, you won't find it here.  If, however, you're looking for a movie with some good characters and an ending that'll really evoke a strong reaction (whether positive or negative) then you'll get it with The Mist.man reactions to the events.  If Saw and Hostel were your cup of Tea, then The Mist is a very different film indeed.     In terms of writing, there's nothing to stark here.  Most of the dialog spoken from the characters is ripped directly from the book.  And it manages to be good.  While the portions dealing with the monsters are far between, it's quite clear the movie wasn't meant to be about them.    The only problem with Darabont's movie, really, is the ending.  Is it a good ending?  Yes.  Will it draw a lot of emotion from you?  Sure.  Will you like it?  There's a divide there.  More than likely you won't.  It is certainly far different from the original ending King had.  I personally did not like the ending but that does not make it a BAD ending.  But if how good an ending is is judged by the reaction, then Darabont has more than likely made a good one.  I will not give it away.  But it IS an ending that could change how much you like or dislike the movie.     The Mist is a pretty good film.  A nice departure from where horror genre is.  This is not torture porn, nor is it a massacre filled with blood and guts all over.  It's a movie filled with human emotion and reaction.  If you're looking for a bloodbath of a movie, you won't find it here.  If, however, you're looking for a movie with some good characters and an ending that'll really evoke a strong reaction (whether positive or negative) then you'll get it with The Mist.
B000YAF4OS|3.0|I am a King fan, and unapologetically so. Having said that, I recognize that there are times that the tomes he writes don't translate well directly to the screen. An excellent example is 1408. The screenwriter mades some changes which were genuinely excellent and seemed more \\"King\\" than Stephen himself.   I have been keenly anticipating the movie version of The Mist since first reading the story. The short format and essentially single setting seemed perfectly suited to movie making. When I heard that Darabont was going to direct, I couldn't think of anyone better than the director of The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption. For the vast majority of the movie, it was very much as I expected. The movie was nearly a virtualization of the story, and I mean that in the BEST possible way. I was very impressed with the acting, and direction etc.       And the there was the ENDING.....       As I noted, I have been reading King since the start in the 70s. Unrestrictedly happy endings are just not on in Steve's world, yet basic honesty and effort are usually rewarded in King land. The original ending in The Mist was stark and uncompromising, but left open some hope and future. The group that escaped from the store did the \\"right\\" thing and had a future having been rewarded for thier actions. The peope who stayed in the store were never commented on again in the story but were pretty clearly lost as a result of thier lack of personal fortitude- they didn't have that \\"something\\" that allowed them to challenge wildly intimidating odds. In the movie, however, the ending showed that the hero and his group had, of course made all the wrong decisions. Had they stayed put, they would have done fine, been rescued, and lived happily ever after- or at least as happily ever after as you could in such a situation.        The movie lost the feeling for individual achievement and integrity that are such a large part of Kings' stories. The movie ending was, depending on your viewpoint; twisted, tragic, aggrivating, inconsistent, cruel, heartbreaking, unnecessary, etc.     Words I didn't hear anyone outside the theater apply to the ending? Good or Great. I can't explain better than that. Maybe there will be one of the famous \\"alternate endings\\" on the DVD. I sure hope so. The rest of the movie really deserves it.
B00005JNJV|5.0|So that we can learn to pick ourselves back up.<br /><br />As many know, the Batman franchise tumbled after Schulmacher took over.  That's not to say Tim Burton was absolutely fantastic either, but at least the first Batman film made in the late 80's, despite not being true to the comic, was still a fairly good film.  Unfortunately, all the Batman's to follow didn't have the same flair.  Once Batman and Robin came, however, that was the end of Batman as we knew it.  Or so we thought.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan, the man behind such films as Memento, decided to revive Batman.  Just about everything done in the movie is right, with only a few minor issues that some probably won't be too upset about.<br /><br />The movie, like many of Nolan's films, beings by jumping around a bit.  We alternate between Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) as a child and as an adult a little bit in the beginning.  Most of you know the story of Bruce Wayne.  His parents were murdered, and its a moment Nolan and crew capture extremely well.  As well as why Bruce Wayne becomes Batman in the first place.  The plot itself centers around Gotham City.  A city Bruce Wayne believes isn't beyond saving.  Years after Bruce Wayne was declared dead, he resurfaces after having gone undergo some training.  With the help of Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) he soon gets all the gadgets and gizmos he needs to become the dark knight.<br /><br />At first the movie centers on Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) and the corrupt system of Gotham.  Falcone has been able to get his thugs into the asylum because of the helpful Dr. Crane (Cillian Murphey) who makes everyone believe they are merely insane.  This upsets Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) who will stop it nothing to put him behind bars.  Wayne decides to clean up Gotham and to do that he becomes Batman.  But he'll soon discover that there's much more going on in Gotham City than Falcone, and that Falcone himself is nothing more than a puppet.<br /><br />The movie is dark and intriguing.  Put simply, this is one of the finest super hero movies ever produced.  Bruce Wayne, in particular, is built up extremely well.  The way everything comes together in the end is nearly flawless.  With some other fine and believable performances by the likes of Liam Neeson and Gary Oldman, Batman Begins is fantastic.  In part because the story manages to be extremely well fleshed out without overdoing too much.<br /><br />The only real problem the movie suffers from is that it takes nearly an hour before Christian Bale dawns the bat suit.  It's forgivable considering the absorbing story, and it surely won't upset too many folks in the long run.<br /><br />This is Batman done right.  A fine movie with a fine director and an unbeatable cast.of the finest super hero movies ever produced.  Bruce Wayne, in particular, is built up extremely well.

B000VI70WM|4.0|I didn't like Duran Duran as a kid. They were hugely popular, and just for that reason I didn't like them. As the years passed, around 1989, I began to like them. From that point forward I bought all of their albums. I realized what too few people did--they were an underrated band.<br /><br />Now, they've certainly had their highs, \\"Duran Duran '81\\", \\"Rio\\", \\"Duran Duran '93\\" and \\"Astronaut\\". They've certainly had their lows, \\"Seven And The Ragged Tiger\\", \\"Big Thing\\", \\"Liberty\\" and \\"Medazzaland\\". They've also had their in-betweens \\"Notorious\\", \\"Thank You\\" and \\"Pop Trash\\". No matter what period of Duran Duran, you can't say that haven't experimented and tried new things. It's this very reason that I've liked Duran Duran all these years.<br /><br />26 years into their career they borrow Timbaland and Timberlake for \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\", minus Andy Taylor. I've read the reviews here and see hypocrisy. Everything the band is employing here is exactly what they employed to get them popular and famous in the early 1980's--synths, dance beats, trendy arrangements--back then they didn't get to work with Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson, instead they get to work with Timbaland and Timberlake--two of the hottest people in popular music right now. Why the harsh criticism?<br /><br />I like Timbaland and Timberlake. Sure, you can tell what their touches are, and in five years time we'll look back and go, \\"That era sounded like Timbaland and Timberlake\\". That said, does Duran Duran have some definitive moments here? Yes. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that \\"The Valley\\", \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\", \\"Nite-Runner\\", \\"Falling Down\\", \\"Box Full O' Honey\\", \\"Skin Divers\\", \\"Tempted\\" and \\"Last Man Standing\\" all could be potential hits, and I'd certainly add them to my own personal Duran Duran mix. The weak tracks are definitely the instrumental \\"Tricked Out\\", \\"Zoom In\\", \\"She's Too Much\\" and \\"Dirty Great Monster\\". Still, compared to \\"Astronaut\\", \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" above average Duran Duran. I wouldn't put it down there with \\"Liberty\\", \\"Big Thing\\" or \\"Medazzaland\\". For a band that's been around for 26 years, this is pretty good stuff. Most bands have already packed it in or are afraid to take musical risks. Duran Duran are still proving that they are valid and viable. I think they have several more successful albums in them and at least one more comeback. I don't think \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" is going to get them noticed. I think \\"Astronaut\\" was better, but it was mainly snubbed my the mainstream. Until people realize that old doesn't equal boring or irrelevance, and that youth must be counterbalanced by wisdom and age, Duran Duran will continue to languish with poor sales and exposure. I also saw Duran Duran perform \\"Falling Down\\" and \\"Hungry Like The Wolf\\" on the AMA's a few weeks ago. They didn't bring the house down. I was disappointed and felt that they didn't do a good job of recruiting new listeners. Millions watched that show and \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" and the first single \\"Falling Down\\" still haven't caught on.<br /><br />All popularity aside, four stars for an above average Duran Duran album.there with \\"Liberty\\", \\"Big Thing\\" or \\"Medazzaland\\".

075640407X|5.0|Why do you read?  Personally, I read to escape... to go on vacation and meet new people, new cultures, learn new histories and new traditions.  I could tell within the first 3 paragraphs that this book was going to be a GREAT holiday for me!  I know the color of the dust on the roads; I know the smell of the wood in the pubs; I know the grit of the streets in this world, and I know it because this book immerses your senses in the world that Rothfuss created.      I hesitated to write a review until all three of the books come out, because it's hard to know where the story will take us.  So far, however, I'm entralled. The story has some of the funniest moments in fantasy fiction; and some of the most heart wrenching as well. The characters sweat and bleed and breath and cry in a completely human way.
B000P0J024|4.0|What a great group of musicians.  Awsome guitar work and excellent vocals!  Wish they had done more.
0553382179|3.0|To be fair, this is probably a good book for anyone who has not read the Sidetracked Home Executives. I guess my mistake was that I read the Sidetracked Home Executives book first and so scrubbing my kitchen sink every day didn't really make me feel any better. My kitchen sink was always clean since doing the dishes and cleaning the sink were already done once I had finished my cards every day.    Although not near as funny and entertaining as the S.H.E books, this is still a great book for people who just want a starting point to cleaning up the clutter in their homes.
B000XKZQ74|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Beautifully told, directed. Intense.
1416905014|5.0|I could hardly believe my eyes when I first opened the pages and saw all those beautiful landscapes, buildings and people come to life. I've never seen a pop-up book that not only shows 3D scenes, but also animated sequences with dancing people! Not to forget the amazing details featured in the book: as you turn a page you see the prince at the ball, he looks rather bored, and some people are talking to him and telling him about the beautiful unknown princess, and when you have completely opened the page you see the prince looking at Cinderella with an excited look on his face and the people who had just talked to him now look at the beautiful girl as well. It's like watching a movie!  I can only recommend this book, although the fairy tale is a bit altered here (i.e. the sisters don't cut their feet to fit into the shoe and some other things).  This is the most beautiful pop-up-book I've ever seen and I can only advise you not to let your children look at it alone. The paper sculptures are very delicate, you really have to handle it carefully!
0786838655|5.0|My 11 year old son has never been a huge fan of reading, but when his friends read and raved about this book to him, he asked me to order it for him.  He loved it and immediately asked for the second book in the series.  He expects to finish that one this weekend and has already asked me to order the third book.  As you would expect, I strongly recommend this book for young men!!!
0375847227|5.0|This trilogy is what reading is all about. It creates a world where you can lose yourself and reflect upon the \\"real world\\" that we live in. I found it moving and important.    I picked up a copy of \\"The Golden Compass\\" as a houseguest at a friend's house. I confess I wasn't much company, as I could not put the book down for my visit. Before I left my host's house, I went online to buy the entire Trilogy which was waiting for me when I got home. I unpacked, and started reading again.    It truly is thought-provoking and brilliant. Unfortunately, it is also dangerous to those beliefs which we simply assume to be true. Questioning and analyzing are basic intellectual activities, and these books are marvelous opportunities to use fiction to really make you think. Perhaps that's why we are seeing so many negative ratings from those who are very \\"faith-based\\". They seem to assume if Faith is questioned (which this series does), then it is anti-Christian. I don't quite get that, as I think Faith without questioning is dangerous itself.    I would agree that the youngest readers may not be equipped for the explorations these books present, but after reading them themselves, perhaps parents will be able to make an informed decision.    Read for yourself, think for yourself, allow the mysteries to absorb you. But don't expect to get a lot done outside of your reading time!!
0099532611|5.0|It's chemistry, that's all. This is the favorite book of my life. I've read all the classics, have a degree in English, write my own novels -- this is the one book I yearn to emulate. I happen to think, also, it's the only really memorable book Pynchon will ever produce. Like F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby,' it is short, tight, and focused. Its bigger sibling, 'V', is an unfocused meander. Gravity's Rainbow is the one other candidate for lasting fame, I think. Yoyodyne is an underground trope, as I have learned, and that's straight out of TCOL49. So why? I'm not sure, but I know I feel about this book the way I feel about my wife -in love for life. What surprises me most is that nobody has attempted to make a movie of it, and that's probably good since it would most likely be a horrible botch. Maybe Ridley Scott could pull it off (my favorite director, and Blade Runner is my all-time favorite film). And again, it's chemistry. What works for me may not work for you. And that's how the universe is meant to be. I guess maybe if I place my favorite movie, Blade Runner, in the vanguard of Faustian tropes and call it a replay of the Frankenstein theme, I might see Oedipa Maas as a kind of Mesopotamian adventuress in the mold of Gilgamesh, wandering through the terrifying echoic forest of Huwawa, which is the ur-(no pun intended)-adventure of us all. Apres nous, le deluge...anyway, the sailor who transcends the burning bed, or the notional rebirth of dandelions in their wine as the season of their spring flourishes, those are among the many memorable notions from TCOL49. And Oedipa's astonishment at the vast, almost galactic street numbers of California...much to be mined here.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is perfect.  A child loves it ,but an adult would love it, also, and not get tired of watching.  I should know from  experience!
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|This movie captures the best of 'sense of wonder' in science fiction tradition. A perfect, self-contained gem with so many wonderful facets. The Faustian, Frankenstein theme of the replicants coming to meet their maker--and killing him...the idea of Pris kicking with zest even as she dies, and Roy saving Decker out of sheer love of life...the light that burns half as long burns twice as bright (my paraphrase)...just a few of the many precious things in this great work of art.
B000Y179KO|5.0|Just the incredible degree of quality (vocals, composition, musicianship, etc.) I'd have expected from one of Rock's greatest ever bands!     These guys are one of the few bands that I own the entire collection of (including Henley's' solo efforts as well); and after seeing them live in San Jose in 2003, it's no surprise: they are every bit as great on stage as in the studio and this album just proves their staying power.    But, come on guys, please don't wait 28 years for the next/last one; I'm your age group and we're all getting' a little \\"long in the tooth...\\" to wait too long!  :0)    GREAT JOB!

1400063515|3.0|The book can be condensed in one paragraph: \\"There are black swans, extreme unpredictable events\\". The book pretty much repeats this over and over again without proving or elaborating on the reasoning. It gets philosophical at times, and \\"black swan\\" sounds like empty slogan in the book. What you can take away from the book is the awareness that there are extreme unpreditable events, if you believe it.     The notion of \\"Asymmetry outcomes\\" (\\"Put yourself in situations where favorable consequences are much larger than unfavorable ones\\") from the book is interesting, but the author just touched on it briefly. It would have been good if the book drilled down with some real life examples.
0743298039|5.0|When I enter into a bookstore, searching for a good book to read, I always head straight towards one section of the store: Fantasy and Science Fiction. The rest of the store fades away as I enter into the realms of dragons and wizards, space ships and aliens, and magic and time travel. It is very rare that I will ever even consider branching out, browsing through the other hundreds of books, and choosing something from another genre. In fact, I can probably count the number of non-science fiction/fantasy books that I have read on my fingers. When I bought The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield, I thought that it was another story of magic, knights, and medieval kings. You can imagine my surprise in finding not a fantasy work, but instead a mystery-filled story of love, betrayal, family, honor, and \\"living ghosts\\". Even though it caught me off guard, it was a more than pleasant surprise, for it is most definitely one of the best works of fiction to ever have graced the \\"New Arrivals\\" shelves.   Diane Setterfield weaves together a magnificent tapestry that not only enraptures the reader in such a way to make him/her feel an actual need to turn page after page, but it also stretches his/her mind, unearthing questions that are not easily answered and whose answers cause even more hard-hitting questions to arise. The story focuses on two heroine-like characters. The first is Margaret Lea, the narrator and an amateur biographer who loves the world she enters upon opening up a book much more than the world she herself lives in. Her past, the story she has kept to herself since childhood, has left her with a feeling of incompleteness and the need to be whole again. The second character is world-renowned writer, Vida Winter, who has charged Margaret with the some-what difficult but long sought-after task of writing her biography. Miss Winter has spent her entire literary life composing not only story after story for her books, but also, when asked about her past, composing story after concocted story for reporters. The difference now, though, is that she is dying. With no way to tell how long she has before her part in the epic tale that is life is over, she employs Miss Lea with the hopes that, when the time is right, the world would learn of her past and how she came to be the way she was.    Why, though, after all those years of lying to reporters, would Vida Winter change her mind? The answer is found in a solitary inquiry posed by a boy many years back in her past: \\"Tell me the truth.\\" Just as this imploration haunts the thoughts of our dying writer, it also begins to haunt the mind of Margaret, and the more she learns of this recluse's past, the more she hungers for the truth in its entirety. As the pair race against time and death to answer the unsolved mysteries of each others' lives, the truth is, in fact, revealed, and the stories are finally told. No one is prepared for the whole truth, though, and even the reader will be taken off guard when everything is brought out into the open.    I invite you to take a journey with Margaret through the dark, foggy past of Vida Winter. Learn why she became the secluded writer, brimming with stories of wonder. Learn about the ghosts that haunted her childhood. Walk the paths of mystery with both the aged author and biography-writing bookworm as they seek the answers of their pasts and search for wholeness in their future. Help unearth the ghosts of the long-ago and the skeletons in their closets. And, above all, learn how a mere footnote to the grand narrative can change the entire story.

It is a much better movie with more believable plot and great acting...plus Jennifer Connelly is in it!

If enough people read this book and change their eating habits accordingly, our health insurance costs will decrease tremendously in the next decade.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|First half of the movie is spectacular, with the perceived danger of the rushing train in the winter wonderland.  The objective of the story is a bit vague, it appears to be one of making the non-believer \\"believe\\".  It's pretty hard not to believe, if you see what these kids saw, so nothing surprising there.  So, yes, a lack of story telling tension, cliched, if you analyze it too much.  However, it IS a holiday movie, and the animation is exciting.  The dystopian industrial strength North Pole is unappealing, and a weak counterpart to the part of the movie where our heroes travel to the North Pole.  All in all, a lot of fun, with a weak ending.  The ride is so exciting, I don't think anyone will complain!
0307346609|4.0|This book was awesome. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect in the beginning, but after getting into it a bit, I couldn't put it down. It describes an alternate history that at times seems so real, it scares you. Every different account that you read through, makes you want to hear the entire life story of that person. All in all, a very different but extremely good read. I highly recommend it.

B00004YX39|5.0|\\"Gaucho\\" is rock elevated to its highest form. The musicianship, arrangements, vocals and melodies are just unbelievable. The quality of the recording is also supreme. To me, this is not only Steely Dan's best album, but possibly the loftiest achievement in the history of rock and roll.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I really liked Death Proof. I am a fan of this type of movie and I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino. Kurt Russel and Vanessa Ferlito really stole the show in this movie. I did get a little annoyed with the second group of females, but that's what this type of movie offers.
0374105235|5.0|I have a deep appreciation for memoirs which allow me insight into social issues that I would not otherwise have.  This book was absolutely amazing.  Ishmael Bea is a talented writer who has overcome tremendous hurdles in search of a place in this world that is safe and where he has the ability to tell the world just how atrocious life can be in the midst of a war... especially for a boy soldier.<br /><br />His memoir is both moving and disturbing at the same time.<br />Suggested for everyone.
B000LE1GVW|4.0|Paolo Nutini is yet another person that I was introduced to as a VH1 You Oughta Know artist, and I was surprised to learn that a strong voice like that was coming from a guy that's only nineteen years old (well, he was when the album was recorded). Yes, I also didn't realize that this album, These Streets, was released over a year ago, but I'm glad I finally discovered it.<br /><br />Most people are probably only familiar with \\"New Shoes\\", but there are plenty of other highlights as well, like \\"Last Request\\" and the title track. There are also some good acoustic selections, whether it be piano (\\"Autumn\\") or guitar (\\"White Lies\\"). And \\"Jenny Don't Be Hasty\\" has some pretty interesting lyrics.<br /><br />Even though the second (acoustic) version of \\"Last Request\\" (the hidden track after the hidden track) is unnecessary, Paolo Nutini still has the skills, so you shouldn't mind taking a drive down these streets.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000BTJDGC|4.0|I was very impressed with this movie because it didn't rely on blood and gore in order to scare the audience, and this movie genuinely scared me. It tells the story of a possessed nineteen-year-old girl named Emily Rose, and the priest who is put on trial for her death. The film is creepy enough with its scenes of Emily's progressing possession, but underneath that is the haunting idea of possibilities.    Laura Linney plays the defense lawyer of Father Moore, the priest on trial. She gives an excellent performance as a woman struggling to put aside her own beliefs and realize that Father Moore's story is very possibly true. As a rising lawyer, she risks her job and reputation to let Emily's story be heard.     The scene of Emily's exorcism is one of the scariest scenes I think I have ever seen in a movie. From her tone of voice to her facial expressions to her dialogue, I was thinking about that scene long after the movie was over, and there was no blood or gore involved.    The only complaint I can think of about this movie is that it did not show the night Emily died. However, this doesn't disrupt the plotline or the audience's understanding in any way. The acting is excellent and the possibility presented that demonic possession may exist is something that truly makes the audience think and question what they know. Very well done.

All she does is screaming, yelling, screeching, straining her fcukin' voice. ALL THE TIME. So annoying. How is that \\"VOICE of the generation\\". She can't even control and runs her own voice. Her vocal runs technique is horrible and Xtina falsetto control are laughable compared with Beyonce. LMAO. And tell Xtina don't ever try to move or dancing cause she look retarded doing it. Thanks.    Go buy the new Beyonce Experience and Justin's concert DVD instead. They both the best entertainers right now and will entertain you in every possible way. If you buy this, don't get mad at me, cause I've warn you, it will disappoint you. Unless you a REALLY obsessed fans of Xtina who don't care if she sucks at live or anything, then buy this. This is not a real show. Even Britney Onyx Hotel DVD show much better than this.

0805079831|5.0|This book reads like a mystery novel and text book, combined.  The information is finely researched and thoughtfully written.  I am not an econ major, but Ms. Klein lays out the facts and theory better than any college professor I ever had. I total understand how the Right-Wing Neo-Cons have used this Milton Friedman-inspired shock theory as a tool to bankrupt our treasury and thereby de-fund social programs for the less fortunate. The US Government is basically transferring our national wealth to a handful of public corporations and private individuals, who will make up an aristocracy  class and take this nation into fascism and dictatorship if it is not stopped soon. The privatization of our most public of services, like the military and school system, is truly a horrific manifestation of this shock doctrine, and will lead to a breakdown in the social fabric of our country.  Good job, Naomi!
B000VUQ4HW|4.0|This is the best we have seen NOSFERATU yet. Beautiful restoration, something like the original Hans Erdmann score--if cut-and-pasted and mixed with familiar classical themes (a little distracting), the most complete print, and more frame information than before (in most places). Yet it's still not as \\"ultimate\\" as it could be.     First of all, it is not, as expected, a direct PAL-to-NTSC conversion of the UK Eureka \\"Masters of Cinema\\" version--both a good thing (very little digital artifacting unlike some other Kino releases) and a less good one as it turns out. Kino has obviously reprocessed it, and not always for the better. On the plus side, for whatever reason, the Kino version is a bit sharper than the Eureka. On the minus side: [1] The basic tint shade of the original restoration, as seen on the Eureka PAL disc, is a yellowish sepia with noticeable warm orange in it; Kino's basic shade is much yellower, sometimes annoyingly glary. [2] The original German restoration on the Eureka PAL disc has considerably more edge information on all four sides than all earlier versions. Kino generally has more than earlier versions too, but compared with the Eureka release, the top and bottom have a sliver less info and noticeably less on the sides. What would have been so bad about window-boxing the film so we could finally see the whole frame as intended?    Kino has done something very odd: they give us the film twice--once on the main disc with newly created English inter-titles, and alone on a second disc with the original German inter-titles and optional English subtitles. Since the second disc is the more accurate way to do it--and the only way in the Eureka set, why bother with the translated-title-card version--especially when the font doesn't match the original very well? There didn't need to be any more than one disc: the original German inter-titles are far preferable and do have optional English subs.     The documentary--originally in German--is nice, but thenew Amerian narrator misprounces some things repeatedly. The Eureka edition has a commentary track; Kino does not. Kino, instead, ports over the same old extras from its 2002 DVD. Come to think of it, given that the Eureka set only has the German inter-titled version with optional English subs and the documentary (as well as a 3-minute \\"how we did it\\" feature common to both), neither it nor the Kino needed to be 2-disc sets! These are best versions so far, as I said, but some questionable decisions make another one probable--and sad to say, perhaps desirable--down the road, at least in the US. Maybe that was the idea: keep the buyer coming back to spend for yet another \\"new improved\\" version.
0521692474|3.0|I purchased this book together with Common Mistakes at IELTS Intermediate. This book isn't what I expected *either*.    It is based on the analysis of exams scripts which scored band 7 or higher but the mistakes analyzed in this book are relatively simple (still!). The book deal with articles (!!!), when to use capital letters (!!!!), punctuation, using propositions, comparisons, contrasts, numbers and amounts, countables/uncountables, and a long list of commonly confused nouns to name the \\"best\\" part of it.    There is, indeed, a very interesting section on describing statistics.    If this is the kind of mistakes one can make and still get a band 7, I would be inclined to think that IELTS needs to be profoundly revised. As an alternative, I suggest the band description to be re-worded and made less intimidating and more in line with the actual performance that is expected from examinees.
B000024D4R|5.0|Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\" released in 1977 is one of the band's best albums ever.  If you are sick and tired of Floyd's previous spacy, mellow, pysch rock then turn your attention to this album.  The dynamics of this album are amazing.  The first and last song on the album, Pigs on the Wing, is an acoustic, short, love song.   But don't let it fool you.  Wait till you immerse yourself in the hard rocking seventeen minute rock opera called Dogs.  It is a hard hitting slap in the face for all the money hungry people of the world.  Gilmore's guitar is a god send and plays an important part in the digesting of the lyrics.  Pigs (Three Different Ones) is also a journey through the mind of Roger Waters as he takes a stab at the pigs of the world: the greedy, self-absorbed, and the gluttenous.  Once again David Gilmour's guitar is a shining contribution to the melody and highlights the anger and distaste found in Water's song.  Sheep has that spacy, old-time Pink Floyd feel, but really opens up with lots of guitar influenced rock.  All in all, this album is my favorite in Pink Floyd's collection.  It may be overshadowed by the popularity of Dark Side and The Wall, but this is really Pink Floyd doing what they do best, rocking out with a message in mind.
B000PKG7I4|4.0|[[ASIN:B000PKG7I4 Frank]]  Great work of music I love it, but imagine my disgust and surprise when I tried to download the CD I had purchased and waited months for Amazon to send to me (I got a back-order notice at one point) to my iTunes so I could enjoy \\"Frank\\" on my iPod but couldn't. Very clearly printed on this cd is an \\"FBI Anti-piracy Warning: unauthorized copying is punishable by law\\".     Since when is backing my music up to my iTunes and listening to it on my iPod a crime? Fine (not). So then I went to iTunes and paid $3 less for \\"Frank\\" plus I received two bonus songs. And it's on my iPod now. Which is how I listen to my music 95% of the time whether through headphones, my radio adapter or hooked up to speakers in my office.     So, two things learned here:   1. This album was worth buying twice. It's that great. I love the sexy and playful ode to office crushes in \\"Amy Amy Amy.\\" The wicked humor of Paris-Hilton-wannabes bashing in \\"F**K me pumps\\" is tinged with just the right amount of that kind of bitchy-sweetness you get when smiling while insulting someone.     Where Amy's amazing album \\"Back to Black\\" smacks of a 1960's alcohol and cigarette-ravaged,  dive-lounge torch singer hasbeen who's still pushing it with bravado every Thursday and Saturday nights, \\"Frank\\" (being three years younger) has Amy's voice a bit fresher and smoother but there's still that attitude in her performance and lyrics that makes the album a necessary part of the Winehouse collection. If you like the retro attention given to \\"Back to Black,\\" \\"Frank\\" uses it in a milder but effective way.     2. Always try to make sure, when purchasing from Amazon, that there is a notice in the product page that the cd is \\"FBI-protected.\\" If there is no such warning, and you intend to download something to your MP3 player, maybe just try iTunes first. Or...Amazon: where's your online mp3 download store?
B000002UAC|5.0|While some may argue that early Beatle's recordings aren't nearly as creative and awe-inspiring as their later material I would have to disagree.  Early Beatles' was the stepping stone towards their greatness and I believe that that greatness can be found throughout this album.  Listening to this album is like taking a step backward in time.  For me it reminds me of childhood and classic music that cannot be tarnished or lose any of its effectiveness.  There are numerous great original pieces that have become favorites of today.  \\"All My Loving\\", \\"It Won't Be Long\\", and \\"Don't Bother Me\\"  are all classics in their own right.  Throw in a few cover tunes that sound better than the originals and you've got one of the best early Beatles' album of all time.  This album is a must have for anyone who enjoys the Beatles, that should be just about everyone, so get yours today and get a slice of history.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|In this movie Will Ferrell plays Buddy, a man raised by elves.  He eventually goes on to seek and find his birth father in New York City.  He finds him, but at first his birth father (the gruff Walter Hobbs played by James Caan) thinks he is looney and it's some kind of joke.  It is somewhat understandable when you take into account the clothes Buddy is wearing (his elf outfit).  Very cute, but a bit out of place.    The real charm of the movie lies in Buddy's child-like innocence.  It is hilarious to see him get into situations that probably would not be exceptional if someone more \\"normal\\" was involved.  He is truly one of a kind and his personality shines throughout the entire movie.  Additionally, he is something of a master decorator and snowball thrower, after getting lots of practice at the North Pole no doubt.  This movie is really fun and funny and suitable for children as well.  A perfect holiday movie if you want to laugh out loud.  This may be Will Ferrell's best movie.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|I laughed so hard I had to take off my glasses to wipe my eyes. I watched it in 3D with my [[ASIN:B000W9Y294 TV Eyes 3-D Glasses: Watch any movie in 3-D]], it made the physical comedy scenes that much funnier to see. When the rat is learning to control the human by his hair, and the first time Remy gets to cook in a real kitchen, jumping and flipping and tossing spices, were great scenes! (All Pixar's movies look great in 3D)     This is one of those movies that kids watch over and over, but like most of Pixar's films, it's done so well that adults are happy to watch it over and over too. The humor was magnificent, very well done. And each of the characters were wonderfully individual. There wasn't any of the \\"sameness\\" you get with a lot of animated movies. The short, overbearing, head chef. The level headed, but fiercely determined female cook. Long, lanky, little boy, Linguini, the natural klutz. And Remy, the rat who dreams of being a cook, who doesn't fit in with the other rats.     You shouldn't eat at a resteraunt before going to see this movie. But if you can ignore the health violations, it's terribly fun to watch a blue rat chef \\"puppetmaster\\" his way around a kitchen.    P.S. Be sure to watch the computer animated short \\"Lifted\\" also on the DVD. It's about an alien taking his \\"alien abduction\\" test. And getting it all wrong. Gloriously funny!
1400064287|2.0|The authors start with two parables, one of which is fiction, the other of which is simply wrong. They start with the urban myth of the harvested kidneys, which they show is a great story but not true. Then they tell the story of a guy who wanted to tell people that the saturated fat on popcorn is bad for you, and they show the \\"truthful success story\\" of how he managed to demonize saturated fat. The only problem with this example is that it's an even deeper myth, fabricated by Ancel Keys and other researchers whose work got them recognition and research money but was essentially made up. There is no link between saturated fat and heart disease - the authors bought this myth and try to sell it in their book as a good way to help others.     There are some insights in this book, and a good focus, but it's nothing David Ogilvy didn't already write in the 80s. It's advertising 101, and one of their tricks is to try to explain why they are following in Malcolm Gladwell's footsteps. The difference is that Malcolm Gladwell looks for the truth and is willing to look past the conventional wisdom. Gladwell doesn't care about the wrapping. This book will help you put a golden wrapper around any message you like, whether you're the tobacco industry or Greenpeace. It's a retelling of the tried-and-true methods of selling anything, and it's all been documented in many other books on sales and marketing. Hypocracy? No. Just much ado about very little.     Nice cover and title, though. They know how to wrap an old fish so it smells fresh and new.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|I was worried this movie would suffer the Batman Syndrome of too many villains, but it works! Somehow they wrote a script that actually supported all the different characters and gave them each their own space.<br /><br />I saw this in 3D using my [[ASIN:B000W9Y294 TV Eyes 3-D Glasses: Watch any movie in 3-D]] and there were loads of scenes in this movie that were just awesome in 3D. The alley chase scene at the beginning. And just before that there's a scene where Peter Parker is swinging in a wide arc around a spire, shooting web bullets at Goblin. It looked fantastic! I had to take the glasses off and back on to keep comparing it! Sandman, in any of his scenes was just perfect. I loved how they had him change sizes and make his fist huge, or when he comes rearing up out of the back of that sand truck, very cool. Also, the climax scene when Spidey, Mary Jane, Venom, Goblin, and Sandman are all fighting in a giant web, and in the half completed skyscraper. That was some good 3d scenes.<br /><br />This was definitely an eyecandy movie. And the heroes and villains were realized, both in emotions, motivations, and CGI to a high degree.<br /><br />But aside from the eye candy, there is actually a lot of story going on here. Peter's struggle with his guilt over his Uncle's death. Sandman's perpetual loser attempts to help his daughter. Even Venom's shallow, selfishness were all completely human and believable actions.<br /><br />This movie was the best of both worlds, over the top complex, beautiful CGI action, and rich emotional storytelling. This is one of those movies that you like more the more you think about it and watch it. It's one of those movies that needs to marinate for a while.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next Spider-Man.
B00005OM4K|3.0|This box set would easily rate five stars if most of Disc 6 didn't sound like a scratchy used record!<br /><br />For some reason, all the tracks from Live in Europe are fuzzy, indistinct, and distorted. The horrible sound sticks out like a sore thumb because virtually everything else is pristine, even the pre-CCR stuff and the songs from The Concert which start off Disc 6. Perhaps Fantasy lost the master tapes. There really isn't any excuse, though, no matter what the explanation may be.<br /><br />Everything else about this box is great. It is somewhat annoying that Fantasy chose to jam everything onto six discs so that each disc contains two albums, but that's just a minor quibble. Besides, anybody with an iPod isn't going to be bothered by how the tracks are divvied up.<br /><br />Bottom line: a great collection and worth picking up if you find a good price, despite the problems on the sixth disc. However, if you *love* Live in Europe and/or you're the sort of person who wants the albums in their original configurations, you will be disappointed by this box set.

Well, it has...I, too, was skeptical (that's putting it mildly!)  Five minutes into the first episode, I was so hooked that when I heard there was only ONE season featuring \\"the new Doctor\\", I was devastated!  All I can say is \\"Jump in and enjoy the ride.\\"  Some are scary, some outright outrageous, at least one romantic; all are worth the trip.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll watch them again.  Just do it.    Oh, and then get ready for the \\"second\\" season, with yet ANOTHER Doctor.  And be prepared to be blown away all over again.

140120306X|2.0|Imagine two of your very good friends taking off for a couple of years and going on all kinds of great adventures, but not bothering to invite you.  Eventually they return home and tell you about how great it all was; meanwhile, you're wishing you could have been a part of the adventures as well.  Feeling left out?<br /><br />Welcome to The Black Dossier.<br /><br />So goes my experience with this entry to the series.  While this is reported to be something of an aside rather than the \\"true\\" 3rd entry to the series, it reads like an epilogue.  Worse, The Black Dossier details numerous adventures of the League in its various incarnations, many of which are quite compelling and engaging, yet this is a book about TELLING the reader of these fantastic adventures, NOT showing them.  We read reports about Mina and Allan in American dealing with Cthulhu horrors, or facing off with a rival league in France, but these are presented as rather dull after action debriefings or journals, often just pages of text, perhaps taking the \\"novel\\" portion of \\"graphic novel\\" too far, and not giving the reader involvement or a stake in these adventures.  Even if future volumes were to detail the various exploits mentioned, they would be hamstrung given the publication of the play by play detailed within--terribly disappointing for a series that unlike many other comics, is willing to kill of major characters and surprise the reader.<br /><br />Regardless, in The Black Dossier, of the original League of volumes 1 and 2, only Mina Harker (now a striking blonde) and Allan Quartermain return for the bulk of the story (both appearing quite young courtesy of a peculiar find in Africa, slyly revealed to the reader while it goes over the heads of British Intelligence), and steal The Black Dossier from a post George Orwell's 1984 England.  The overall plot is little more than a straightforward chase (to use the term generously) as Mina and Allan flee England with The Black Dossier, although there is little sense of danger or urgency as the pair leisurely take flight, giving the impression of being on holiday rather than at any real risk.  (The main action sequence, which takes place in a \\"space port\\", is brief and neither Mina nor Allan is particularly challenged by their opposition).<br />As usual, Mina (rightfully so) takes the lead, although poor Allan does little other than ask obvious questions so that clumsy exposition dialogue can tumble from Mina's mouth in an effort to explain what is going on and why.  Again, the reader is often told rather than shown--a strange choice for this medium--and given the rather \\"extraordinary\\" exploits of volume 1 and 2, nothing here even comes close to matching the excitement.  The story comes across as rather mundane, more \\"Jason Bourne\\" (well, James Bond) than fantastic until the very end--and ending which amounts to little more than a tour, rather than any kind of significant resolution (such as volume 1) or cliffhanger (volume 2).  The Mina and Allan of fifty years later seem a bit like shadows of the characters fans of the series came to respect and appreciate in the first two volumes: Allan is largely insignificant and Mina is a mouthpiece for the writers, neither is allowed to flourish as characters or grow.<br /><br />While I found this volume largely disappointing, there are numerous interesting bits throughout The Black Dossier, although these are individual nuggets here and there.  For instance, the character of Orlando is introduced through an eighteen page back story, detailing how the immortal character \\"Forest Gumps\\" his (or her) way through 3,000 years of human history while often changing genders--it reads much better than it sounds in this review, yet the character has little to do with the story as a whole, other than a few other intriguing mentions during other League adventures the reader misses out on and what amounts to a cameo appearance at the end.  This introduction, as well as the introduction of many numerous other characters (members of the League, rivals) give the feel of a rich and textured world that the reader is only given a sliver or glimpse to enjoy--frustrating when there is clearly much more than could be done with both this text and the series.  Other sections of the book are small treasures, such as the \\"PornSec SexJane PicTell\\" insert (1984) and the postcards written by the League and sent to British Intelligence over their many adventures.<br /><br />The literary and fictional references are not only present in this volume as the previous, but the volume is turned up to 11, giving those who enjoy the \\"Where's Waldo?\\" aspect of the League plenty to appreciate in this volume.  The production values are also amazing.<br /><br />Overall, for those readers coming to the series from the \\"LXG\\" movie, the graphic novels have nothing in common with the movie other than the shared name.  Of the three, The Black Dossier is certainly the worst choice for anyone curious about the series, given it's clearly written for those already familiar with the characters and world.  As another volume of the series, I found it was a disappointment, even if judged as a tangent to the \\"core\\" series of stories (which seems to beg for a sliding scale that The Black Dossier sorely needs).  There definitely are gems here for the dedicated fan of the series (and frankly, those might be enough for the diehard fans), but the generally weak story and \\"tell, don't show\\" feel of the book far outweighed positives.  If this were published as an epilogue after ten or twelve volumes of the League, I believe I would give it a positive review (under the assumption that the numerous adventures were told about were detailed elsewhere), yet published after the first two volumes The Black Dossier serves as little more than a clumsy tangent or (worse), as a spoiler for what could have been many engaging adventures of the League in its various incarnations.haracters (members of the League, rivals) give the feel of a rich and textured world that the reader is only given a sliver or glimpse to enjoy--frustrating when there is clearly much more than could be done with both this text and the series.

032147404X|5.0|I am an aspiring photographer who has read all of the main theories and concepts in other books and online (by the way, Canon has a great online tutorial to learn about Digital SLRs and photography [...] ). Anyway, the book is going to get right to point about what you need to buy, set up, or do to get better pictures for different scenarios. I really liked his to the point techniques without the technical stuff behind each one. He makes it clear in the beginning that if you want to learn more about photography and all the principals that this is not the book for you. This is just a quick guide on how to make better photos in various situations. I found it funny, easy to read, and exactly what I was looking for to improve my shots.
B000002GBB|5.0|Styx was at a peak around the time of the release of superb album The Grand Illusion (1977) and Pieces of Eight (1978) presents more of the same good musicianship.  Like The Grand Illusion, Pieces of Eight demonstrates the band's ability to write tight compositions that fused the progressive rock and hard rock influences seamlessly and it also went triple platinum.  For a lot of fans, Pieces of Eight marked the end of their \\"classic\\" period.<br /><br />The lineup on Pieces of Eight includes Dennis DeYoung (synthesizers, pipe organ, keyboards, vocals), Tommy Shaw (electric and acoustic guitars, mandolin, autoharp, vocals), James Young (electric guitar, vocals), Chuck Panozzo (electric bass, vocals) and John Panozzo (drums, vocals).  The musicianship on Pieces of Eight is good - soaring three and four part vocal harmonies; ripping Hammond organ work; agile synthesizer solos; dynamic acoustic/hard rock contrasts; and to top it all off, wonderful harmonic and melodic development.<br /><br />The ten tracks on the album range in length from the synthesizer showcase The Messenger (1:08) to I'm Okay (5:41).  The pipe organ on I'm Okay is great and reminds me somewhat of Rick Wakeman's use of a pipe organ in a rock context on Going for the One (Yes, 1977).  My favorite tracks include the two instrumentals The Messenger and Aku Aku, although the whole album is very enjoyable.  Overall, Pieces of Eight presents a nice mixture of the harder edged \\"stadium rock\\" tracks and tracks that give a slight nod in the direction of English progressive rock.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine album of progressive hard rock released at a time when the English prog giants had either disbanded or were on their way out.  Along with groups like Kansas and Rush, Styx made great music with high production values and most importantly - was very entertaining.  Recommended along with Equinoxe (1975) and The Grand Illusion.

0807126063|4.0|According to many people, this is a classic.  Now I won't go that far, but this book introduces us to one of the greatest type of characters - the educated buffoon.  I like to refer to it as the first smart-stupid comedy.    The first thing I must say is that the readability is quite lacking.  The superfluous flowery language, the street vernacular, and the outdated slang make it quite annoying to read at some points.  I know that many people say that that is part of its charm.  That may be true, but nonetheless, it's not an easy Sunday read.    That said, this book is character driven, and Toole really delves into the eccentricities of all characters involved.  The plot really revolves on Ignatius Reilly; a master's educated fat doofus with tons of book knowledge, but no social skills whatsoever.  A computer nerd way before computers really were popular.  A Comic book guy way before the Simpsons.  He deals with his mother, his mother's friends, a bad luck cop, a mysterious hipster girl from New York, the owners and employees of a pants factory and a seedy bar all in complex and humorous interminglings.    Not only funny, it sheds life on a non-classical dysfunctional family, the city of New Orleans in the past, and a whole lot more.  While the humor and insight is entertaining, the fluidity of the novel takes away from a great novel.

B000066NW0|3.0|Personally, I really enjoy some of the songs on here - even after growing out of that stage. Avril Lavigne pretty much defined my preteen/early teen years of being a (wannabe) tomboy. Here are some very catchy songs that make you happy to be a girl and get lost in lust and all that.     But if you're not a teenage girl all you'll see is inane lyrics with no point whatsoever.     Still, Avril Lavigne was so much better at this time than she is now - just another idiotic blonde popstar who sounds like she's whining 99% of the time. This album has an outstanding singing voice that you can't help but sing a long to. Great present for the younger girls. Older people will just call it fake punk made for the radio.

0385341067|5.0|On an island caught in the middle of a conflict it cannot escape, Mr. Watts was a diamond in the rough. This strange white man was a mystery to everyone until their fates had been sealed. With tension rising between the opposing sides of the war many people were able to flee the island. When the last boat was gone, no one was left to teach the children. No one except for the unknown Mr. Watts.     Mr. Watts ran an unconventional school. He had no personal knowledge to pass on to the children, but understood that they needed to learn. One technique he employed was almost \\"show and tell\\" meets \\"career day.\\" One of the villagers came to class and shared anything they could with the kids. This may have been the best places to fish, a recipe, or a piece of the island's history. (As a sidenote, these visits to the schoolhouse were my favorite aspect of the book.) The only other way we saw Mr. Watts engage the children was by reading them a chapter per day from Charles Dickens's Great Expectations.     The story was recounted by a girl who was, at the time, a 13 year old living on the island. She lived with, and tested the patience of, her mother. Her father had left the island years before in search of work. Through Mr. Watts she developed a profound relationship with Charles Dickens, and more specifically Pip, the young protagonist in Great Expectations. And through Charles Dickens she developed a special relationship with Mr. Watts. Thanks to her we saw not only life in school, but how the village was directly affected by the fighting. When homes were burned and people were killed we saw how dire the situation was for the people stranded on the island.     This 13-year-old girl was still a child and should have been able to be one. She, like the other children, did not have that option. Her father was gone and she was always fighting with her mother. She had to witness things that no one, let alone a 13 year old, should ever have to see. Great Expecations became a fairytale to her; a world into which she could escape. And Pip was her guide. From daily peaks into his story, Pip became as real to her as anyone else on the island, maybe even more so. And just as easily as any villager could have, Pip became the cause of a great misunderstanding with a group of men with guns who do not like misunderstandings.     Lloyd Jones gave us a beautiful story full of hope, disappointment and a very unlikely school teacher. He wrote with a balance of poetic imagination and narrative story telling that made me love this book.
B000MRAAJW|3.0|Sure the 'breathtaking' footage is the same. But Sigourney Weaver's narration is far more comfortable to listen to than Attenborough's. I opted for her HD (as presented on Discovery HD Theater in the States) at full price, 79.95, available only from the Discovery Channel with free shipping. But... ya gotta pay tax if applicable in your state.
B000UJ48VI|1.0|What a sleazy tactic:  WB reissues the same lame DVD version of this magnificent film the same day that they release the Kubrick special edition box set.  Yes...I know...there was nothing in the description of this DVD to mislead people into thinking that this was also a special edition.  I remember thinking that when I preordered it.  But I figured if WB is going through the trouble of reissuing Lolita on the same day as the special edition box set, then the DVD must be improved in some way (anamorphic, extras, SOMETHING!).  But alas...I was duped into buying what I already had.  Shame on me for giving WB the benefit of the doubt.

B000002L7J|4.0|It may be something of a middle child in the Smiths' discography (coming, as it did, between their brilliant self-titled debut and the monumental classic that is The Queen Is Dead), but the group's sophomore release is still an excellent album. Stylistically, it shows the group branching out slightly from the moody jangling indie-pop of their debut, beefing up their sound with light experimental elements, as well as the occasional touch of funk. The core sound is still the same, though- the songs are built around Johnny Marr's intricate, understated, and hypnotic guitar constructions, as well as the tongue-in-cheek depression, sarcastic poetry, and haunting vocals of lead singer Steven Patrick Morrissey.     The best songs here easily rival their other classics. \\"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\\" is one of the Smiths' most haunting songs, with a spine-tingling vocal creating slowly mounting tension while guitars and drums churn apocalyptically in the background. \\"Rusholme Ruffians\\" is a prosaic gem, with gorgeous slice-of-life lyrics that are by turns hilarious and heartbreaking twisting their way over a rumbling rockabilly backing. There's also the wailing guitar feedback and bizarrely grim character study of \\"What She Said,\\" and the nerve-shaking punk funk of \\"Barbarism Begins At Home.\\" \\"The Headmaster Ritual\\" has lyrics that are only so-so (a half-hearted attempt at social commentary that, frankly, falls flat on its face), but it compensates with a great guitar line. \\"I Want the One I Can't Have\\" is a wistful pop gem, albeit a minor one. \\"Nowhere Fast\\" gets by on a shuffling rhythm and great lines like \\"When I'm lying in my bed/ I Think about life and I think about death/ And neither one particularly appeals to me.\\"    There is a noticeable drop in quality toward the end of the album- the last four tracks just don't pack the punch that the first six (or five, if you have the British LP) do. The title track is particularly disappointing. Morrissey's lyrics, while undoubtedly graphic, come off as preachy more than anything else, while Marr's melody is only so-so. \\"Well I Wonder\\" isn't quite as desolately beautiful as the band wanted, although Morrissey's falsetto sounds nice.    So, a very good album from a band that has done much better. Smiths fans should get this.
140120306X|5.0|Others have already commented on the lack of a simple linear plot as compared to the first two LoEG volumes.  Others have also commented on the elaborate layout and production, involving changes in style, paper, etc.    I think in many ways the core of the book is the last section with Prospero's speech, which (to me, at least) reveals the authors' true love and sense of gratitude for the adventure literature of their youth.      That alone was enough to make me smile and reminisce about my own childhood and the hours of enjoyment and escapism that all the characters featured in the LoEG universe gave and still give me.  I am blind in one eye and could not enjoy the 3-D effects, but still enjoyed the last section very much.  What better way to reinforce the 'reality' of these fictional characters than to make them three dimensional?    If you are looking for straight action, stick to Marvel or DC.  If yuo want something to chew on and think about, this makes a great addition to the LoEG canon.    If you like the literary detective work found here, you may enjoy Silverlock by John Myers Myers available in pb as [[ASIN:0441012477 Silverlock]] or with an excellent readers guide and other useful material from the NESFA as [[ASIN:1886778523 Silverlock: Including the Silverlock Companion (Nesfa's Choice, 26)]] which treats classic literature in much the same way.

006112429X|4.0|\\"We Need to Talk About Kevin,\\" by Lionel Shriver, is a nightmare of motherhood made real. It is a contemporary domestic horror story about a Columbine-like school massacre. The book deals with the crime of 15-year-old Kevin Khatchadourian, a boy who--with monstrous premeditation and extreme brutality--murders seven classmates, a cafeteria worker, and an English teacher. We are told these facts early in the story, but the full details are withheld until the end.<br /><br />The book is the tale of Kevin's life told with unrelenting introspection from his mother's point of view. The story unfolds as a long series of letters from the mother, Eva, to her estranged husband, Franklin. The letters start one-and-one-half years after the murders, and end on the two-year anniversary some five months later. Eva's purpose in writing the letters is clear: she is overwrought with guilt and seeks to determine if she may have contributed to her son's crime by not loving him more. She hopes by recounting, in agonizingly raw detail, the story of her 18-year-long relationship with her son, that she will finally be able to uncover the truth--knowing the truth, she may then perhaps be able to come to terms with herself, and somehow get on with her life.<br /><br />We reader wants to know the truth, too! So we grasp the covers of this book with white knuckles and are compelled, with ever-increasing disquieting fear, to read on. We read on despite the fact that we do not like this protagonist, or her miscreant son. We read on like a spectator in a slowly unfolding real-life horror story--we can't turn it off--we have to know all the details. Of course, ultimately, we do...and the ending is a terrific shocker made all the more so because the build up has been so intensely draining.<br /><br />At one point in the novel, the author unintentionally mocks the voyeuristic interest of her readers. Kevin seems to speak directly to us during a TV interview after the crime. \\"All you people watching out there, you're listening to what I say because I have something you don't: I got plot. Bought and paid for. That's what all you people want, and why you're sucking off me. You want my plot. I know how you feel, too, since hey, I used to feel the same way. TV and video games and movies and computer screens... On April 8th, 1999, I jumped into the screen, I switched to watchee. Ever since, I've known what my life is about. I give good story. It may have been kinda gory, but admit it, you all loved it. You ate it up. Nuts, I ought to be on some government payroll.\\"<br /><br />So what about the mother? Is she guilty? That question is never resolved in the book. It is left up to each reader to determine on his own. If you read the reviews, you'll see that the author has achieved some sort of balance between those readers who believe the mother is at fault, and those that believe that Kevin was just born bad.<br /><br />I had a difficult time with this book. There were many times I wanted to just put it down and forget it, but I had promised to review it, so I stuck with it. Given other reviewers' reactions to this book, my own viewpoint is probably not typical. I am the type of person who switches off the TV during long, live, real-life horror news--not because it disturbs me, but rather because I loathe the entertainment circus, preferring my news filtered by reliable print journalists. I am also the type of reader who actively shuns autobiographies (and this is a fictional autobiography) because I am too conscious of the self-delusions that fill their pages with half-truths.  Understanding real life takes multiple viewpoints to get us past our own self-delusions. When reading book-length coverage of horrendous true-life crimes, I prefer the journalistic integrity of a nonfiction specialist like Ann Rule. Now there's an author who turns out authentic real crime page-turners! When you finish one of her books, you know you've got the real answers behind the news.<br /><br />I knew from the beginning of this dark tale that I'd never get a clear picture of events if we were only allowed one viewpoint, and that one from an immature, selfish, self-centered woman who obviously lacked a biologically normal degree of empathy. The mother and son were so much alike, what separated them was only the degree of their incapacity for empathy and therefore how much their handicaps hampered their life in general.<br /><br />The epistolary structure of the novel was at times so artificial that it stretched my imagination past its breaking point. It was also far too restraining! Every thought, word, and remembered detail of dialogue by another character had to be filtered through Eva's mind. It put the reader in the prison of Eva's mind for the entire book. With such an unlikable character, I found this a most uncomfortable situation.<br /><br />In an interview with the author in the Toronto \\"Globe and Mail\\" (July 7, 2004, p. R3), Shriver shares her thoughts about her own similarity to Eva. \\"I'm sufficiently close to her in type that it's hard for me to say I like or don't like her. I'm ambivalent about her in the same way that I'm ambivalent about myself. I gave her a lot of qualities that I believe I have in abundance but they are not necessarily likeable, and I don't necessarily find them likeable. I consider myself very selfish. I don't easily give up my time or energy to something that I don't get something out of. So the idea of spending morning after morning with a toddler drives me nuts. It would be killingly dull. And so I have a fun, interesting life. Travel. Write books. And die.\\"<br /><br />Although I can sincerely appreciate why this novel won the Orange Prize, I also had trouble with the author's prose. On the sentence and paragraph level, the writing was truly outstanding, but over the course of 400 pages it became painfully obvious that a good editor might have helped Shriver enormously. This book could have been far better with far less. She has a tendency to overwrite, and that, combined with the unrelenting introspection, guilt, and discordant tenor, made for some very tough slogging. To say the least, this was not a fun book to read.<br /><br />I am pleased that I finished this book. In the end, the book left me with a chilling and disturbing portrait of Eva Khatchadourian, a woman of little empathy trying to raise a son perhaps void of any empathy at all. Over the course of 400 pages, I came to understand and care about this fictional woman. She has my sympathy, despite the fact that if I ever met her I'd go out of my way to avoid any further contact. I've met others like her--these are extremely difficult people. Typically there exists great devastation in and around their personal lives and they seek to draw you into it. I avoid such people, but when I can't, I remember to be as forgiving and understanding as I can while still managing to be on my guard at all times.<br /><br />My take on the title is that the author wants us, the readers, to \\"Talk about Kevin\\"--in our heads, as well as with our friends...and in this manner spread interest for the book like a contagion. Given the book's enormous marketing success over the past four years, I'd say this tactic has succeeded beyond the author's wildest dreams.<br /><br />So, I recommend this book, but with significant reservations. If you've never known a woman like Eva, then this is your opportunity to do so without endangering yourself in the process. Also, if you like horror genre fiction with a feminist twist and a lot of excellent literary overtones, then this may be exactly your cup of tea.k tale that I'd never get a clear picture of events if we were only allowed one viewpoint, and that one from an immature, selfish, self-centered woman who obviously lacked a biologically normal degree of empathy.

B000002U82|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - If any person would like to enter into the most pure concepts of music, boundary-breaker objects/emotions the human being has created, or start building references from start points of music genres throughout eras, The Dark Side Of The Moon would definitively be a point of transition. Pink Floyd had already created unique music in their previous albums, specially Meddle, but this is their top masterpiece, defining an era in music. A commercial success, selling more than 40 million copies, and the longest place in billboards in history, it surely contains commercial, listener-friendly compositions, short songs with no pretentious sounds or unusual melodies, and a pure and simple structure which simply divided the world, being impressive with its concept of simple human progresses and surroundings; time, money, people, breathing, and insanity, just to mention few. The Dark Side Of The Moon is a key album into defining the peak of space rock, the revival of psychedelic rock into modern settings, the point were blues is taken into a higher prospective, the point were progressive rock can't be called pretentious but remarkable nor snooze cultural but sincere and direct, and the unique characteristic where music fits with the listener and musicians in the most pure way; not their most complex neither their most cultural one, but the most pure.<br /><br />Each piece is also perfectly put together but it can also sound perfect spliting them into separate songs, \\"Speak To Me/Breathe\\" is just hipnotic, starting with a heart beating, it gets through with some soulful guitar lines and relaxing vocals, \\"On The Run\\" and \\"Any Colour You Like\\" are both key transitioning instrumentals that may define the electronica genre, provided by tape effects (not mellotrons), \\"Time\\" gets a more common and softbeat feeling but it kicks-off with the introducing clocks and alarms, which may have introduced the music concr&eacute;te style into Pink Floyd music. \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\" is a timeless classic, not too much of a song but more of a vocal proof reference to any kind of music, consisting of subtle screams from a woman (Clare Torry), which eventually leads to Pink Floyd using a women's chorus in their performances. \\"Money\\" is maybe their most famous song, dealing with materialism in society (which gets funny seeing this album's sales!), its the most explosive piece in the album, with a signature guitar solo from Guilmour that can stay in your head for days. \\"Us And Them\\" is the most serene but still serious piece in the album (just the mood the album needed), it has its potent moments but its calm atmosphere is just beautiful. \\"Brain Damage\\" sounds with more common textures but it deals with its theme of the human mind (and insanity...) in avery adequate way. Finally, \\"Eclipse\\" is the conclusion of the piece, its a very good end because it ends with emotion and a quirky hope, as \\"the sun is eclipsed by the moon\\".<br /><br />The musicianship is more like an atmospheric beauty that surrounds each play, although there are a lot of their albums wich feature better playing of instruments, this is just nice, specially because of the tape effects; all lyrics are by Waters, and the compositions are worked out with the band members working in each piece (not just Waters...). The material comes with great artworks, lyrics and credits, not as the LP but great anyway, the sound is loud and adequate too. So, I could never conclude such a masterpiece in the way I'm expecting so I'll just recommend you to regard it as a human achievement instead of just a music album.a timeless classic, not too much of a song but more of a vocal proof reference to any kind of music, consisting of subtle screams from a woman (Clare Torry), which eventually leads to Pink Floyd using a women's chorus in their performances. \\"Money\\" is maybe their most famous song, dealing with materialism in society (which gets funny seeing this album's sales!), its the most explosive piece in the album, with a signature guitar solo from Guilmour that can stay in your head for days. \\"Us And Them\\" is the most serene but still serious piece in the album (just the mood the album needed), it has its potent moments but its calm atmosphere is just beautiful. \\"Brain Damage\\" sounds with more common textures but it deals with its theme of the human mind (and insanity...) in avery adequate way.

B000XPU5NY|5.0|After the disastrous sound quality of their recent box sets, Genesis have released a sonically amd musically superb live album. Makes one wonder what the hell is going on in the Genesis camp these days.    While the tour set list is almost a ''best moments'' compilation from their previous tours, really you can't argue with the fact that no one plays better than this band.  These songs are challenging for the best of musicians and I just sit there amazed wondering how they can pull it off.    One small complaint is the absence of the crucial vocal part on Dukes Travels.  But hey I just sing along instead!  Maybe Genesis can give me an audition if Phil leaves again!
159562015X|5.0|Strengths Finder 2.0, by Tom Rath, is the updated version of Now Discover Your Strengths, also by Rath.    The very notion of this book is great. Instead of constantly seeking out things we are bad at to try to improve them, it takes the counterintuitive approach of asking what you are good at. I found it truly empowering -- and the data backs it up. Turns out people react much better when you seek out ways to let them use what they are good at instead of pointing out their flaws.    So the idea is to focus on strengths instead of weaknesses. Not focusing on strengths leads to a lack of emotional job engagement. So strength-focused employees (and managers) lead to better results, both personally and for the company.    And there's more than just great content.    This is a wonderful combination of a web workbook with a printed guide. With your purchase, you go online and complete a survey that lets you gain the full effect of the book. The survey will determine your top 5 strengths and give you 10 action ideas for each one. That's 50 things to do to activate your strengths!

B00006H67D|5.0|This isn't Coltrane's best album, but it's a masterpiece just the same. It's also probably the album to start your Coltrane collection with (preferably with A Love Supreme and My Favorite Things), since it's extremely creative, but still accessible. Now, I love the free jazz albums, but those aren't good for starters unless they're coming from Ornette Coleman or someone like that.<br />So anyway, this album begins with two of Coltrane's classic compositions; the lightning-fast bebop of the title track; and the earthy, bluesy \\"Cousin Mary\\". Witness Trane's strides towards free jazz on the former - the \\"sheets of sound\\" technique is already firmly in place, the melody is only quoted briefly, and the solo often gets quite intense. Meanwhile, the second track is much more traditional, almost Mingus-inspired, but boasts a fine melody and skilled bass playing by Paul Chambers, who also adds a great solo to the lengthy \\"Mr. P.C.\\". The third classic at hand is the tender ballad \\"Naima\\". It's a good thing that song has one of the best melodies ever composed, because it's pretty much that melody, a brief variation, a quick but beautiful piano solo, and that melody again. The last of the \\"ultimately awesomely fantastic songs\\", rather than the \\"Just really really good\\" songs is \\"Syeeda's Song Flute\\", with a playful but far from cloying (and actually very catchy) melody. For the record, Syeeda was Trane's daughter; Naima was his wife; Mary was a real cousin of his. I learned all this by looking in the liner notes, for the record.<br />So, now we have those other two. \\"Countdown\\" is probably my least favorite on the record, but it's full of ENERGY; and \\"Spiral\\" has a cool melody.<br />And the bonus tracks are pretty good, often enlightening. My favorite is the alternate \\"Naima\\", which adds drums and a different sax solo; though I've gotta say that the alternate \\"Countdown\\" - about two minutes longer, and with a great drum solo, is better than the take they kept. Only \\"Syeeda's Song Flute\\" is virtually unchanged, since \\"Giant Steps\\" draws in a different sax solo that's as good as the one on the album take.<br />This is a very worthy purchase for any Coltrane fan. Absolutely perfect. And it's not even his best album.is virtually unchanged, since \\"Giant Steps\\" draws in a different sax solo that's as good as the one on the album take.

This book is a wonderful look at the industry surrounding the substance our prosperperity is based on. A highly interesting collection of characters and situations. I recommend it to anyone.
B00005JPS9|4.0|In 6th century Denmark, Kin Hrothgar's (Hopkins) kingdom is being terrorized by the monster Grendel (Glover).  The king calls for someone to come and defeat Grendel.  Beowulf (Winstone) answers that call, seeking glory more than gold.  On his first night there, Grendel attacks and Beowulf must deal with him.  But, Grendel is not the only creature waiting to terrorize the kingdom.  Grendel's mother (Jolie) and a dragon also lie in wait.    Computer animated and only loosely following the epic poem, \\"Beowulf\\" is an entertaining feast for the eyes.  I think that animation was the way to go with this story, and the images are very realistic.  Voice talents of Winstone, Hopkins, Jolie, Gleeson, and Penn all fit well with the characters.  Purists will probably be disappointed with the changes, but for those not familiar with the story will probably have no problems.  \\"Beowulf\\" is a great example of how far CGI has come, and an excellent diversion for those craving some action.
B000X5KSWM|5.0|For a long time, I've hoped in vain that the universe would turn upside down and Tarja Turunen and Nightwish would get back together and go back to making the epic opera rock they were famous for everywhere (except America). However, Nightwish moved on with a new singer and a somewhat different sound, leaving me to hope that maybe Tarja would be back with the sound I loved so much.    Well, all hopes might not be in vain after all...    \\"My Winter Storm\\" brings back much of what I've been missing, even from the new Nightwish. Tarja's powerful voice is showcased throughout, and deservedly so; there's no mistaking that the Queen's voice is the focus and the reason for it.    The music itself is evocative of \\"Once\\" and \\"Century Child\\", albeit with less metal emphasis. Her band is actually quite good; tracks like \\"Lost Northern Star\\" and \\"Damned and Divine\\" can stand up against anything that Nightwish has done. My favorite track has to be \\"Sing for Me\\"; it sounds like a lost track from \\"Once\\".    If you miss the old Nightwish, this album won't disappoint.

B000RZIGVS|1.0|I was so excited when I ordered this, couldn't wait to get it. I watched Season 1, then almost all of Season 2. My disc player couldn't read the last disc. I received the replacement and had a problem with jumping images on season 1 even thought the disc was clean. I checked the disc, cleaned my player and tried again. Same problem. Amazon refunded my money promptly. In reading the reviews I noticed someone else had problems with their original purchase and their replacement. Apparently, Paramount has either a problem with quality control, or no quality control at all. I also agree that the packaging is shoddy (holding the disc holders together with tape--what's up with that?) I would strongly advise against purchasing this item until Paramount fixes their disc issues. And I hope Amazon notifies everyone who was forced to get refunds due to Paramount's incompetance when this issue is resolved.
B000R7I3LY|3.0|After listening to a sample CD featuring \\"Love Song,\\" \\"Bottle It Up,\\" and \\"Gravity,\\" I was hooked--this woman has an amazing voice and songwriting talent! So I bought the full-length CD and I have to tell you, the overproduction on this album is almost criminal! Instead of the simple \\"Love Song\\" on the sample that features Bareille's ultra-rich voice accompanied by a piano only, the album opens with an overblown pop anthem that completely dilutes the song, the strength of her voice, and the soul of the song. Each song that followed had a similar over-production that only allowed the heart of the song to peep it's drowning head through before burying it again in bland drums, electric keyboard, and pointless background vocals. This soulful singer seriously needs to find another production company--I'm appalled on her behalf, and saddened that such a fine talent should be treated with so little respect.
B000K7UG20|3.0|I spent the past couple of minutes watching this, thinking that I was going to see the very cute guy - Adam Garcia - from Coyote Ugly. Anything's better than Michael Douglas with a very dodgy haircut. (Very dodgy - it's practically a mullet.) Unfortunately, they share the same surname and the same first initial, but Andy & Adam are two very different people. Both very cute though.<br /><br />I have to say I'm not Michael Douglas's biggest fan (that would be my mother), but I don't spend every second of his screen time wishing he would go away. I'm not that bad. I can watch him.<br /><br />The film is mindless entertainment, with an interesting title - I have to say I like the idea of black rain. It's a familiar story - bad guy cop, teamed up with reasonably good guy cop, after a bad guy, thrown into the wrong situation and having to struggle out of it. The wrong situation here is in Japan, where the American cops have no say so in what happens. They have to escort Yasuka Matsuda, playing Sato, (who died not long afterwards), and hand him over to Japanese police. Simple right? Not so. Police officer uniforms no doubt hired from the local fancy dress shop are worn, and Sato is handed straight into the hands of his friendly bad guys. Cue much hysteria when the real cops turn up. Oooops!<br /><br />The film escalates from here, with rigid cop rules, and an unfamiliar place to try and get the bad guy back in the right hands. Unfortunately, Michael Douglas pretty much plays the same character he played in Basic Instinct, so he's uninteresting in that sense. Andy Garcia was not only refreshing, but probably should have got the lead role. Let what happened to him happen to Michael.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said this cop movie is very eighties, and very cliched. Yes, that may be so, but have these reviewers watched Lethal Weapon recently? That is the number one eighties movie. But Mel's hair is worse.<br /><br />Black Rain is surprisingly enough an entertaining movie, not really what I was expecting, but still excellent all the same. Prepare to shed a little tear at Michael behind a wire fence thing.till excellent all the same. Prepare to shed a little tear at Michael behind a wire fence thing.

B000WQ9UA8|1.0|I love Britney... She made me dance and be \\"Stronger\\"... She made me cry and think \\"Someday (I Will Understand)\\". She made me apologize because \\"Oops, I Did It Again\\".  But unfortunatly she didn't do it again.  This album is a mess of hodgepodge styles and she sounds soulless and disinterested.  I had hoped she would pull her career out of tabloid hell with this album.  But Britney needs to disappear for a while and get her personal life together, then hopefully, she can \\"Hit Me Baby (One More Time)\\".
B000UX6THK|5.0|I purchased season one of twin peaks in 2003.  It contained the first 7 episodes that made up season one, without the pilot.  I waited 4 years for season 2, and had heard a rumor that season 1+2 would be released with the pilot, so i traded my OUT OF PRINT season one, and waited, In April, season 2 came out.  WITHOUT a reprint of 1.  I've been devistated.  Finally this October came with the gold box edition, 10 discs, 2 versions of the pilot, season 1 and 2, and plenty of extra features, This is what i have been waiting 4 years for, and it is very much worth it!
B000VR824S|5.0|In July 2007 Eric Clapton had his second concert for Antigua. As he did the first time, he filled the event with first class musicians, from not just Rock, but Country and Western also.  Eric had a list of Superstars including, Sonny Landreth,John McLaughlin, Doyle Bramhall, Susan Tedeschi with the Derek Trucks Band, Johnny Winter and Robert Randolph, Robert Cray and his band, Jimmy Vaughn, Hubert Summerlin, BB King, Vince Gill, Albert Lee, Sheryl Crow, Willie Nelson, John Mayer, Los Lobos, Jeff Beck, Robbie Robertson, Steve Winwood and Buddy Guy.  If you like the blues, the concert is for you.   Highlights include BB King doing, Paying the cost to be the boss as well as Albert Lee doing a lightning fast version of Country Boy.  Sheryl Crow, Vince Gill and Albert Lee as well as Eric Clapton do a hopping version of Tulsa Time which includes Jerry Douglas playing slide electric guitar instead of his specialty, the dobro.  Willie also does a great version of Blue Eyes Crying in the rain as well as his signature song, On the Road Again.  Jeff Beck steals the show with his versions of Cause we ended as lovers and Big Block, you hear the master as his very best. He also has a young lady who is about 16 or so playing bass. She is a very talented bass player. Sheryl Crow does, If it makes you happy.  Clapton then comes onstage and does, Tell the Truth as well as the George Harrison classic. Isn't it a pity, and the Robert Johnson, Little Queen of spades.  Steve Winwood then takes the stage with Clapton and does the Blind Faith classics, Presence of the Lord as well as, Can't find my way Home and Had to cry Today, and finally the Cream and Robert Johnson classic, Crossroads.  This CD has a little bit of everything, with young musicians like Derke Trucks and John Mayer with Doyle Bramhall, as well as BB King and Buddy Guy and Hubert Summerlin.  I highly recommend this concert to anyone who likes blues, Rock or Country, Western Music...........You will watch this over and over

B000ZBEOF6|5.0|When I saw the previews in the theatres I thought.Ok Looks good,songs you already know.And they tell a story.That put this on my to see list.However I had to wait 3-4 extra weeks for it to be shown in my town.But was worth it,the songs stuck in my head and had to get the soundtrack.I can't wait for this to come out on DVD.With cameos by Eddie Izzard,Bono (of U2),Joe Cocker,and Salma Hayak(sp).It is an amazing story of two young lovers who meet during the Vietnam War. Jude (Hey Jude) comes from England to find his real father who was stationed there in WW2. Lucy (Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds) in America already waits for her boyfriend to come back from the war. Prudence (Dear Prudence) is a Cheerleader from Ohio,who happens to be a lesbian and decides to leave for the big city.Jude meets Max (Maxwell's Silver Hammer) when he goes to the University where his father is.Max just happens to like the new guy and takes him back home for Thanksgiving.Max is Lucy's brother and decides at the table to drop out of collage.Therefore making him eligible for the draft. Since Max has decided to drop out,him and Jude take off for New York. Once there they meet their \\"Sexy\\" landlord Sadie (Sexy Sadie),who just happens to be the lead singer of a band.Lucy on her bike,sees 2 soldiers come to her botfriends house as they tell her the sorrowful news.Lucy unable to cope at home decides to go to New York to stay with Max and Jude for a while.At the same timeframe riots break out in Detroit [I think] and enter JoJo (mentioned in the \\"Get Back\\" song.)who we meet at a child's funeral as well.These 5 people (Jude,Lucy,Max,Sadie,and JoJo) experience their lives in their own ways set to the Beatles music.With Bono (YAY!!!!!) as Dr. Robert (Yes like the song),and Eddie Izzard as Mr. Kite (Benefit of Mr Kite)guiding them through trips,losing and then finding what really matters most to them.  Would also recommend the Deluxe Soundtrack since it has all the songs on it.Which will conjure images again and again.
B000V7O0GM|5.0|This is the first movie I watched on my HD-DVD player and I think it was a good choice. I was disappointed in the first couple of minutes with the video as it didn't look that much better than regular DVD. Once they went outside that changed. They skies were clear blue and it looked awesome! The sound was great, gun shots sounded very real. As for the movie, I thought it was very good, but not quiet in the class of Goodfellas.

B000Y179KO|4.0|I bought this CD because I had seen the Wal-Mart commercials using \\"How Long\\", and thought I'd like that one song, at least. I was very pleasantly surprised, however, and have enjoyed the entire two disc package. The voices (and harmonies) of all the current Eagles are as clear and beautiful as they were in the '60s and '70s, and the musicianship and production in all the songs are wonderful. I think it is a little comical that these men are all maybe a bit old (Glenn Frey is the youngest at 59, the other three are 60 this year) to still be singing about broken hearts, breakups, etc., -- subjects that one usually would expect much younger men to be concerned with. Listening to this thrilling collection, however, quickly makes their ages beside the point. (And I don't care how old Don, Timothy, and Joe are anyway -- they've got IT!)

0525950079|2.0|I liked Pillars of the Earth, and have read it several times.  It is fascinating and richly woven with detail and character.  It highlights the struggle between good and evil, in society and in each one of us.  Decent book, good story.  In Pillars, there are hints that the author feels disdain for clergy, but it's not the main story line.<br /><br />But Ai-yi-yi, where to start with World Without End?  Some things are distracting -- nearly every cleric has a lover, and most of them are homosexual.  It's just too obvious.<br /><br />The sex in the book is monotonous.  Two people kiss, then hands fondle breasts -- IMMEDIATELY.  Every kiss in the book.  Sheesh!<br /><br />The common usage for the term \\"nunnery\\" in the middle ages meant \\"brothel\\", not \\"convent.\\"  Given the contempt of Christianity and virtue on display in this book, I can only imagine that the word \\"nunnery\\" was selected on purpose, and then repeated without variation for 1000 pages.  World Without End, indeed!<br /><br />Count how many times the transition \\"After a while, \\" is used.  Distracting -- poor editing.<br /><br />For the most part, the book was engaging, but not compelling.  There were interesting sections on the engineering of structures -- that was really the best part of the book.<br /><br />The love affairs of Caris and Merthin were amazingly and needlessly complicated.  **SPOILER ALERT** They meet and find one another fascinating.  They fall in love.  Will she marry him?  No, she doesn't want to give up her dreams.  She aborts his baby.  Years pass, they are still in love.  Will she marry him?  No, she wants to be a doctor.  Will she marry him?  No, she stands accused of witchcraft.  Now she takes refuge in the church, begins her medical learning in earnest.  He loves her still.  He's terribly unhappy.  He leaves town, travels Europe, learns a lot about architecture and engineering, marries, has a baby.  Caris is heartbroken on hearing the news.  She becomes lovers with another nun.  The two nuns travel to France to try to persuade a bishop to DO THE RIGHT THING with regard to their town.  But wait!  There's hope!  Here comes the plague!  She becomes an even better doctor, her nun lover dies; he contracts plague and survives, but his wife dies.  Reunion!  Will she marry him?  No way, she just can't give up her work.  He says THIS IS THE LAST TIME I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO MARRY ME.  No, she won't.  Desolate, he becomes lovers with his brother's wife (oh, yes! it's true).  The plague comes back.  In the end, boy gets girl, middle aged though they are.  This, along with corrupt clergymen and -women, deserving peasants, violent gentry, a gruesome execution, 50 incidents of breast-fondling, and a secret buried in the ground comprises the plot. **SPOILER END**<br /><br />It was tiresome and tedious.  The engineering sections were interesting.  The medicine was engaging.  The love story was silly.  The plot twists were predictable.  The pettiness was eye-rolling.  There was not much loyalty, piety, honor, or faith on display.<br /><br />I'm a booky sort of person.  Skip this one, unless you're a Ken Follett junkie or love tantalizing glimpses of the homosexual clergy.  Go reread Pillars.<br /><br />Sheesh.ade a bishop to DO THE RIGHT THING with regard to their town.   But wait!  There's hope!  Here comes the plague!

B000V8I2QU|4.0|To those who say the CD sounds too muddy,etc the mix   is an integrated part that meshes with the message of the CD. Does it sound harsh and muddy and distorted-- have you turned on the news lately- my friend ( a John McCainism) , you are supposed to react the way you did. This is not 1987 or even 1993. The Boss is not trying to serve you up a nostalgic fantasy- he's trying to get your head in the church of what's happen' now. Ever listen to Hendrix's \\"machine Gun?\\" you can hear the cries of horror of the times in the notes. I have been studying poetry interpretation lately, and Bill Shakespeare was doing it way back then-- just when the reader was expecting a smooth ending to a sonnet, Bill ( and many other poets all the way to the present) would create all kinds of dissonance with the meter that had the same effect on the reader then as Bruce's mix has on you now. Unfortunaely, most people have long lost the sensitivity to nuances like that in the art form of poetry, but the techniques are alive and well in popular music, which I would argue has taken the place that poetry once had. So if you feel sort of mad and disappointed and unsettled after listening to the CD, Bruce has delivered -- it just may not be the message you're wanting to hear.
B000001DQG|5.0|CARIBOU, Elton John's fourth album as a real rock & roller (and his tenth overall, if you count the soundtrack to the film FRIENDS) is a great one. This is one of the most underrated Elton albums of all time, and anyone who claims it's not the equal of GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD should be institutionalized in a psychiatric facility's secure ward. I know I'm sounding a bit harsh, but I feel this way because this album was the first not to feature the hollow-sounding orchestral arrangements of Paul Buckmaster, who seemed to make real violins, violas, and cellos sound synthetic. Instead, we get the Tower Of Power Horns on many songs, which adds punch to both the rockers and the ballads. Any putdown of this CD is, in my view, a form of temper-tantrum.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|This is and was the only regular (not cable) program that my family has watched for it's whole run.  I, too, was confused with all of the changes (I hadn't read or seen anything about all the writer problems), but like all things in life, it was destined to end.  Lauren Graham did an absolutely wonderful job of playing her part, as did the others.  But, sometimes, I don't know how she could shoot out her lines like a machine gun.  Just amazing!  The characters/actors were all wonderful.    We won't be able to sneak off to Stars Hollow on Tuesday nights anymore and even though we have all of the seasons on DVD, my family won't rush home to watch it together.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|What a nice little flash. It is small, bright and works automatically with your digital Nikon DSLR. On my D40 (see my review) the results are terrific. The built-in flash is fine, but bouncing the flash off the ceiling gives is better. Soft and natural looking light, no red eye either. I was surprised at how nice the lighting is.     It is capable of quick and repeated flashes, again up to a point. It does use common AA batteries which obviously have their limitations, but they are also cheap and available anywhere    If you turn on the SB-400, the camera's built-in flash will not pop up. If you mount it on the camera, but don't turn it on, the the pop-up flash will hit it and will not flash. No damage or anything, it just happens. So, take it off if you aren't going to use it and turn it on if you are.    The D40 does not have built-in remote flash control like the hold D70 did. And this little flash does not have the capability to trigger other flashes.     This flash is inexpensive, small, super-easy to operate and works perfectly with the camera's exposure control. It is perfect for anything other than fancy remote flash control and Nikon's special macro flash system would be better for that use.    If you have skipped additional flashes because of complication or cost, like I always have, give this a try.

1594489505|5.0|I never would have chosen this book on my own, but it was a book club selection so I reluctantly bought it.   That's what I love about book club - it forces you to read books you would never consider and this one is nearly life-changing.   Although fictional, the culture lesson is unmistakable.   It truly touched me.  There's nothing like a book that is written so well you feel as though you are in the room with the characters watching the plot unfold.   Excellent book.  Highly recommended!   Thanks!
B000R02K6A|5.0|Well, I've been a huge Iron Maiden fan for about 20 years, have enjoyed every album (although I do consider the 90's ones a bit of a drop in quality from the 80's, with the new lineup somewhere in between).  Over their 3 albums from the 2000's I've noticed a mixture of the 80's and 90's styles (considering the mixture of lineups, I suppose that should make sense!).  While I think there is  noticeable decrease in the full-on energy and speed of their youth and they do repeat certain musical ideas, they also break new musical ground with each album.  Adrian Smith with his return brought back some of his polish, tasteful soloing, and fantastic arranging (suddenly we see a return of the little guitar fills and counterpoints while the other guitars play the riff or chords), but we have a more raw, in-your-face sound (when you put on an 80's Maiden album after a new one, it sounds rather weak at first, until the fantastic musicianship and songwriting make you forget about the mix and sound).  I think it's interesting people keep commenting about how this album has a \\"prog\\" sound as if it's a new thing - the same was said of Powerslave, Seventh Son, X Factor, Brave New World . . .   Maiden has always had a prog influence (listen to Steve Harris talk of his love for Jethro Tull, Yes, early Genesis, etc.) and this album continues that tradition.  One of the strengths of this album is that it actually does take one element of prog a little more to heart, with several riffs and sections in 7/8 time signature, while continuing the other prog elements that have been Maiden staples for ever:  epic songs  with many different musical sections, written out musical interludes (as opposed to just \\"jams\\"), and non love/rock/cliche lyrical subjects.  In fact, this album seems to have brought the little harmony guitar interludes to the fore more than any since the 80's, which is what I always considered to be Maiden's strongest point.  It also teems with Adrian Smith's wonderful aforementioned guitar additions, Nicko McBrain's most inventive drumming since the mid-80's, and the most upfront bass sound we've heard for ages, all of which make the sound more rich and 3-dimensional.  Maiden's combination of heavy with musically rich and melodic really make them in a league of their own - and stand out fantastic at the live shows.  While there are nastier/heavier bands out there, Maiden's sound ends up being more interesting over a long show, at which point other bands just start to become a dull noise.    Although Maiden have a habit of repeating rhythms and musical ideas (something I've noticed since No Prayer For the Dying), they've always simultaneously pushed their sound in new directions (although I can't say they try new influences, they just seems to stretch their own sound mostly).  This album has some of the best evidence of that - \\"Lord Of Light\\" and \\"The Legacy\\" both start out with a haunting slow acoustic section that is very moody and atmospheric, and quite different from the slow intros we've grown to expect from Maiden.  (The best point of reference would be the acoustic coda to \\"The Prophecy\\", which was fantastic and they never seemed to try again until now, but it's really more reminiscent of the intro to Genesis's \\"The Musical Box\\".)  \\"The Lord Of Light\\" then takes off into a fast, very metal song that is probably the most like classic 80's Iron Maiden I've heard them do since the 80's -it's every bit as good as their heyday, without sounding like their repeating themselves.  \\"The Legacy\\" goes into an epic fanfare after the intro, before settling into a mid-pace main section - - actually, I was a bit disappointed by this;  after their best intro ever, I think it would've been more musically effective to really take off with something high-energy after building all that tension, but the song's OK (just not the best thing they've ever written, like it starts you thinking it will be).  Also, \\"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\\" and \\"Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\" have some heavy-groove based riffing for the main verses that's certainly not Maiden repeating themselves.  Many of the other songs are pretty much the same kind of riffs and melodies that are Maiden's signature sound, but certainly different enough not to bore someone who likes what Maiden do.    \\"Different World\\" is the kind of straight-ahead rocker that started the previous album, which seems to be the most commercial/radio friendly song.  It has a chorus that's a little more \\"modern pop rock\\" than we'd expect from Maiden (again repeating \\"Wildest Dreams\\"), but does also have a great opening riff and some nice guitar interludes.    I read a review stating \\"Out of the Shadows\\" sounded like classic Iron Maiden, which is rather odd, since it is a power ballad and Iron Maiden didn't do any of those in the 80s!  I personally think the power ballad is generally a waste of musical time, some bands (Scorpions, Aerosmith) can do one or maybe two an album and it's a nice contrast musically, but often they really just come off as weak filler tracks I could do without (Metallica, modern Deep Purple, Iced Earth, Bruce Dickenson solo, etc.).  Maiden does better with non-cliche slower stuff (\\"Strange World\\") or at least songs with slow and fast parts (\\"Children of the Damned\\", \\"Blood Brothers\\").  \\"Out of the Shadows\\" is a decent song, but not a great one.  I have to admit, since I got this album the day it came out, it's still  one of my most-listened-to CDs.  (I may note that I've bought many other great CDs in that time, yet none have made me want to listen to them again and again as much).  I don't know if I'd rate it with Powerslave or Seventh Son if I'd just gotten them, but after hearing them for 20 years straight, this is good enough and new enough to make it a favorite.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Though it is not the first Star Wars film in many peoples minds, it is in mine. Here's my review for Star Wars Episode I, The Phantom Menace.    The Phantom Menace does not try to be anything it isn't, the film is overshadowed by the creepy, elusive, and demonically tattooed Darth Maul, that will scare the crap out of kids who have come to see something along the lines of Harry Potter. The ending battle is not overblown, and it also ends up being fairly fun to watch.    Besides some weak acting the only prominent error in the film resides in one name.    Jar Jar Binks    This stupid and irritating characters next to destroys every scene he's in, with his crontroversial manner of doing things (which some seem to believe is a Jamaican steretype, which might very well be true), his stupid way of talking and his clownish appearance he succeeds in irritating the audience to death.    Besides this major flaw, this is a fun movie that I recommend, and a good start to a very good sci-fi epic.

Jurassic Park:    This original, superb, cunning classic will forever be a favorite in my library for a long long time. It conveys scares, action and humor in just the right quantities, resulting in an adventure film that you're almost garunteed to love.    Recommended age limit: 8+ violence and some language    9/10 stars  ----------------------------------------------------------    The Lost World: Jurassic Park:    A sequel was unavoidable. here it comes, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (or Jurassic Park 2 by some Fans). This sequel includes all the laughs and action of the first film, but not quite as much scares. The characters seem more like action hereoes than unsuspecting prey of the dinosaurs like in the first film, making it seem less like they were going to die, making it less scary. It also seemes like the only thing extras were meant to do was get eaten, I mean what are the odds of having 40+ people on the island and only the three main characters surviving?(give or take a 1 or 2 others)  As a whole not as good as the first, but still a fun flic,k, recommended    recommended age limit: 9+, more violence than the first film    7/10 stars  ----------------------------------------------------------    Jurassic Park III    After the decent second film JPIII firmly rebounds and renews the franchise with thrills, spills, and a lot more violence than the other films. While the bodie count is lower in this third installment, there are more on-screen deaths in this third film. Although the violence is more, the feel is lighter, resulting in a more realistic feel. What I mean by this, is that in the other films it always seemed to start raining whenever the dinosaurs attacked, this gets a little cheesy after a while. Luckily there is only one sequence containing rain in this film, and it's at the end. Also, it's structured different than the others, in the other ones they saw the happy plant eaters first then they got attacked by the meat eaters and you can barely recall seeing plant eaters for the rest of the film. In this new installment, they save the plant-munchers for the middle of the film, and the blood-thirsty ones appear as the first thing they encoun ter on the island. Now this may seem to some as a way to try to get to the munching part right away, but it doesn't seem to be that way during the film, you see, the dinosaurs don't appear out of no where, they come because some one is stupid enough to repeatedly shout through a blow horn. This ends up as a much better way to introduce the creatures than in the previous ones.    recommended age limit: 9+    8/10 stars, encore (and they will too)
0743454537|5.0|Jodi Picoult has definately created a difficult situation here. I can see why most people would hate this book, but it presents a cause that I'm sure people are dealing with and so the story becomes more real. Picoult had a nice way of putting us in these characters shoes and made us see that it's not as simple as it seems.

B000PY52EU|5.0|I have to say that this movie was surprisingly WONDERFUL!! It was quite a refreshing change from the usual predictable movies out these days. A very creative story. I was glued to the screen and when it was over, I watched it again! I would recommend that anyone that wants to see something different watches this movie. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You might even cringe. It is great!

B00005JPS9|2.0|More like [[ASIN:B00003CY5D Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within]] than [[ASIN:B000QXDED6 300]], Beowulf is the latest entry into the new geek-cinema-dom. That's to say that it comes to the screen looking like an adolescent's fantasy of medieval times, complete with operatic bellowing ala \\"300\\" and goofy menacing monsters like [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings Trilogy]], but offering none of the virtues of either. Instead, you get a few barely recognizable actors offering voice talents (Ray Winstone, Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins) as plastic looking simulacrums from motion capture animation constructs their characters.<br /><br />As in \\"Final Fantasy,\\" these characters look more like plastic He-Man and Barbie dolls, lacking much for facial expression and skin features. \\"But it's a cartoon,\\" you doth protest? Well, yes and no. The animators here went to great pains to make this look like live action. Like most prominent CGI features nowadays, star talent is given headline status and much ado is made over Angelina Jolie. She plays Grendel's Mother, who tricks Beowulf into his eternal rule over the Danes. (Except in the original poem, she's dead before the story gets this far.) She is also a CGI-artist's wet dream, emerging from the water with just a touch of gold dripping from her enhanced chest like some exaggerated Bond Girl. It screams of testosterone wankesterisms on the part of the animator who turned the character into an image from a bad Frank Frazetta painting.<br /><br />And that about sums up everything about \\"Beowulf.\\" The animation is aimed directly to the crowd that thinks the Halo and Doom games are the ultimate in realism, and made by directors that (much like the almost as dreadful [[ASIN:B0002Z0EYK Troy]], which at least kept the actors human) think a centuries old story needs to be deconstructed because a modern audience probably could care less about that stuffy ancient literature.<br /><br />There is also something else bent about \\"Beowulf.\\" The violence is graphic and even disturbing (like the soldier that Grendel tears in half), yet a naked Beowulf - even an animated one - goes though all sorts of ridiculous machinations to not display his endowment? C'mon already, even Bart Simpson bared it, and at least his preposterous barricades were funny. There have not been this many wiener-blockers in a single take since Austin Powers. With all the raging hyper-violent testosterone flying about this movie (and the scene in question) this reeks of cop-out. It may be a movie all about Beowulf The Brave, but this contradiction heralds it as a movie made by Robert Zemeckis the Coward.<br /><br />You want to see this done right? See [[ASIN:B000GIXEIG Beowulf & Grendel]], a live action film starring (oddly enough) 300's Gerard Butler. It is everything \\"Beowulf\\" is not; subtle, populated by humans, not garish, taking a few liberties with the story yet leaving the core intact. Zemeckis should have been chained to a chair and forced to watch this version before embarking on yet another failed realization of an historical epic.ic and even disturbing (like the soldier that Grendel tears in half), yet a naked Beowulf - even an animated one - goes though all sorts of ridiculous machinations to not display his endowment?

0385512058|4.0|It's a decent book and suggested reading by my brokerage firm.  It does have good tips.  The only criticism I have is all the name dropping.  I see this in my own profession and often wonder whether it is a necessity.  To me, it seems like a sign of insecurity but I am new.
080701429X|5.0|...and usually only respect the advice of those who have walked their talk, then you need to read this book. Dr. Frankl endured the horrors of three Nazi concentration camps and then thankfully lived to document his experience and, more to the point, the effects of the camps' conditions on himself, his colleagues, and his oppressors.     The book's first part contains Dr. Frankl's observances of human nature in the concentration camps, while the second part discusses his technique of logotherapy. Logotherapy, in contrast to Freudian techniques, doesn't immerse itself in childhood conflicts and sexual frustration. Logotherapy instead asserts that humans ultimately desire to know and live the meaning of their lives above all else.     He cites his staying alive in the camps for his wife, who at one point resided in an adjacent barracks yards away, as an example of how meaning in his own life inspired his survival. He also discusses being kept alive by his drive to further develop his ideas and theories about the human quest for meaning, which he actually began forming before entering the camps. These two examples cover the main ways he says humans find meaning -- in relationships and in their life's work.    He also discusses suffering with dignity and the function of an inner spiritual life as a respite from harsh and humiliating conditions. Highly recommended.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|I'm so pleased to see that this is coming out on DVD!  I taped this (Met production?) off of the TV and my tape is all messed up.  So now I can replace it, and with something that doesn't have a Severe Weather Warning in the corner, either.    This was a beautiful production.  Tatyana and Onegin are sung by real stalwarts.  But I had never heard the Mexican tenor(?) who sings Lenski and that was such a nice surprise.  He has a beautiful voice and did a great job.  I hope they have included the behind-the-scenes footage they showed on TV - he was chuckling that he didn't really see himself as a tragic young Russian romantic, but that he would do his best!    I've always loved my dear Onegin in any form.  I am definitely pre-ordering this!
B000RG1FMO|1.0|So here we go...another Kanye West album for misinformed Rap fans to flock over and praise it as \\"the best thing since sliced bread\\". Compared to Kanye's past work, this album is such a letdown. This album defines nothing but terrible Hip-Hop. At least this guy was being original on his great 1st album, \\"The College Dropout\\"(2004), but \\"Graduation\\" is such a prime example of the degrading and overplayed Rap in the mainstream of 2007.     On a production level, this album achieves nothing knew as to what Kanye West has done in the past. He is still sampling old and new songs in a way that is completely obvious(meaning that the sample is so familiar that the listener won't be able to distinguish it from the real song and the new \\"mixing\\" from Kanye). The majority of the album relies on cheap synthesizers and hand-claps. It's hard to distinguish this album from the Synth-heavy sounds of the Southern Hip-Hop scene because it sounds entirely similar to anything mainstream these days.     Lyrically-wise...again, Kanye relies on cliche' topics such as politics, drugs, money, and girls. I think many people by now are fully aware that Kanye uses various \\"ghostwriters\\" for his lyrics proving that he is nothing close to being something of a Rapper. He will always be a producer before a rapper.    He was a top-notch and classy guy during his days with Roc-a-Fella Records(1999-2003) when he produced for Jay-Z and Beanie Siegel, etc. but now he is a washed-up individual who spews nothing but hatred and ignorance.    If you would like to hear a great combination of a Producer/Rapper music then I suggest you check out DJ Premier(probably the best Hip-Hop producer ever). Buy this for great production/lyrics: [[ASIN:B000KEG8UC Mass Appeal: The Best of Gang Starr]] or if you want to hear from the legend or rap himself..2Pac, check this masterpiece out:[[ASIN:B000005Z0K Me Against the World]]     Kanye has brought nothing new to the dying genre of Rap. Rap died in 1997...when Puff Daddy took over with his pop-rap.
0307237702|5.0|There have been many reviews of this book I add mine to the most favorable ones. This book reflects a philosophy about America and its political, social and economic issues in a fresh and inspiring way that one can see in  the Presidential campaign as we approach winter of 2007.     I read Sen. Obama's auto-biographical first book first. I couldn't imagine that he could have two outstanding very significant for our times books .. he has..
0307346617|5.0|Here's an audaciously entertaining slab of horror from an author who benefits from a sense of humor and satire. Max Brooks has employed a very unique method and structure for this novel - a future history told in fictitious first-person accounts, as told to a reporter. A post-apocalyptic mockumentary, as it were. This is an interesting technique because the main plotline must be fueled by the reader's imagination, and a little bit of deep thinking is required to figure out what really happened during the worldwide zombie rampage that forms the story's backdrop. Brooks also creates a plethora of interesting characters who offer multicultural interpretations of the reign of the undead - from a blind Japanese sensei to South African freedom fighters to even dachshunds in the K9 corps. Some parts of the novel get a bit repetitive with so many brief first-person accounts zooming by, and the lack of lasting characters is a valid criticism. But Brooks also sneaks in a fair amount of social and political commentary, and his examinations of how world society really would deal with, and recover from, a worldwide catastrophe displays a realism that is far beyond standard horror or sci-fi. (And those who bellyache about Brooks' subversive politics are surely from ideologies that disdain creative and pragmatic thinking.) This is a highly creative and very enjoyable novel, and a few of us are now better prepared for when the real zombies start to show up... [~doomsdayer520~]
1582701709|5.0|I got the book a year ago. It sat on the shelf until 3 weeks ago...at 14 weeks pregnant our doctor told us that we were losing the baby. He said he had never seen a baby survive this state. It was Thanksgiving weekend so he said \\"Schedule the surgery to remove the baby after the holiday and go home and pray for a miracle.\\" We were devastated. I was on bed rest so I picked up \\"The Secret\\" I decided I was going to use the principles to save this baby. First I realized all the things I already had in my live to be greatful for. Then I \\"Asked\\" for what I wanted, and then I worked hard to \\"Believe\\". I spent hours visualizing the baby bathed in fluid and growing. I then practiced \\"Receiving\\" the baby. I imagined bringing the baby home from the hospital. The first day was hard but by day two I had gone from crying and depressed to feeling strong and powerful that my body could heal and this baby could be saved! We went in for a sonogram the following Monday and the doctor was shocked! The baby was not only alive but moving with a strong heartbeat. The condition was reversing itself. This little baby is proof that this process works! It is not easy. Don't take this book lightly...it takes strength and conviction but if you really look deep and change the way you think and live I believe this book (that can feel superficial and \\"get rich quick\\" on the surface) is rooted in amazing insightful philosophy!
0525950079|1.0|I have read all Follett's other books and enjoyed them very much. \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" was a great read. It was with great anticipation that I procured \\"World without End\\" and was eagerly looking forward to reading this sequel. About an hour after I started reading I woke up having read just 7 pages. I kept trying to get into the book every day, but there was nothing that held my interest. It would put me to sleep each time I tried to read it.  I usually read books like this one at a rate of about 80 pages an hour, and for a couple hours at a time,  but after ten days of attempting to read this book I had only gotten to page 120. Every time I attempted to read the book it would put me to sleep. There was just nothing that held my attention or caused me to gravitate to any of the characters. On the tenth day I picked up the book and thought, there are more than 900 pages left in this book, and I am just at page 120, so why waste my time reading a book I do not enjoy. I moved on to my next book and was again reading about 80 pages per hour.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|I'm trying to think of the best way to say this. I wrote a review for one of her cd's about 10 years ago and couldn't think of anything sensible to say then either.    I've watched the dvd about 20 times now and I continue to be moved by the music, the performance and the location. Imagine being there?! I've been to the Alhambra and was enchanted by the moorish palace. Thought the christian one looked dark and cold and clunky - reflects the relative states of the civilisations at the time I guess.    So let me tell you about what I can see.... standard drums, bongos and various other percussion; hurdy gurdy; irish bagpipe (they blow the bellows under their arm); a variety of instruments which I haven't seen before including a really small mandolin played with a bow!; some electric guitar but not a lot; a large acoustic fat looking lute type thing that gives a lot of the authentic hooks in the songs; double bass played by a striking blond lady (especially good on the lady of shallot); electric violin played by a bald guy with clark kent glasses - virtuoso exhibition probably at his best on Santiago - the other players acclaimed him when he finished; last but not least Loreena herself. She plays piano, piano accordian, harp and last but not least her astonishing voice. She is a tall (well she looks tall, hard to tell ;-) ) striking redhead with a voice to stop wars.     The songs vary from traditional irish ditties like Raglan Road to her classics like Mummer's dance and the brilliantly done Santiago. She bangs on about the celtic thing but really there is a strong eastern influence - which I guess makes sense considering the celts originally lived at least as far east as anatolia in turkey - but for a written history they could be as famous as the romans who piggy backed somewhat on their accomplishments.    Anyway, I've said enough. Its Friday night and I've had a tough week. You can probably tell that I'm a fan. What a thing of beauty this dvd is. Truly world musicat its best. If you are a fan you should own it. If you don't know her and you are interested in world music or just good music give it a try. You won't regret it!

B000VLE3IS|4.0|Really good sound upgrade. Might want to wait until if/when all the albums are released with the new remastering job. Sounds better than the 1990 remastered stuff
B000002G7G|4.0|I just purchased this remastered version of the Velvets' 3rd album, which provides both good news and bad news. The good news is that the sound is definitely improved, with far greater clarity and the guitars louder in the mix. The bad news is that the original version of \\"Some Kinda Love\\" is missing.  Some genius decided to replace the original with an inferior version -  different instrumental track, different vocal track, and different lyrics.  This new track could have been added as a bonus track if somebody felt that the world needed to hear it, but --- what were you thinking?  Plus, there's no mention anywhere inside or outside the booklet that this remastered CD no longer contains the original, far superior version of \\"Some Kinda Love.\\"    One star deducted for somebody messing with a rock 'n' roll classic and showing contempt for fans of the music.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|\\"Spider-Man 3\\" is a wonderful if a bit shaky successor to the spectacular \\"Spider Man 2\\" from back in 2004.  Though the reviews were decidedly mixed, it still became a phenomenal success.  I can't say for sure that it can stack up in the long-run against it's predecessor. I mean, I don't think they could surpass the mini-sun fusion machine that Doctor Octavius created.<br /><br /> The dust settles from the epic confrontation with scientist turned diabolical madman Doctor Octavius. Peter Parker's double-life as Spider Man and as Peter Parker seems to be settling back to normal at last. Mary Jane has returned into his life, things are looking up, and New York cleans up from the magnetic mess from the mini-sun that brought down Pier 56. However new threats emerge. One is a criminal named Flint Marko is on the run from the law after escaping from prison on murder charges. Due to quantum circumstances, Marko's molecular structure is altered significantly which causes him to transform into Sandman who becomes Spider Man's most powerful adversary. The other one however is an enemy that is unlike any other. It is not even just another bad human. It is an alien liquid life form that survives by attaching itself and assimilating itself onto a human called a Symbiote. And when it bonds with a host, it's very difficult to separate from it. This symbiote will have major influences on Spidey that could potentially make him worse than the villains put together if allowed to fester for too long. The effects of the symbiote are enough that they are already making Peter into something that others no longer even recognize.<br /><br /> This movie though while still a five-star suffers from a particular problem called character saturation where too many major characters are brought into focus. The same thing weighs down \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" from a year before with too many characters.
B000AMMSQC|5.0|i watch this twice a week, i have six versions but cannot get past this one. a previous reviewer used the description (touch me if you dare)which i thought described miss zakharova perfectly.  the principal dancers and corps also costumes and sets are exellent this is absolutely the best dvd i have ever bought and is value for money, plus the extras . the two principals could walk or dance on swan lake, i love it, can you tell.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|Let me first say that there is not a bigger fan of Bruce Springsteen & The E street Band than me. A friend once told me, \\"...if Bruce read the phone book you would love it\\". I said, \\"you're right, because he would do it better than anyone else.\\"   This new CD however does nothing for me. Where are the stories? Where's the band? It's a lot of noise with lyrics that just do not resonate. Remember the first time you heard Thunder Road, Hungry Heart, Nebraska or The Rising? Nothing stands out here. The production is terrible. What a waste of the band.  Having said all this I'm sure Bruce's next CD will be great.
B00008PW2D|5.0|Sex and the City - The Complete Fifth Season is short but sweet. Only 8 episodes because Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon were both pregnant at the time so the season was cut short. A lot of reviewers have been complaining about season five, they say it's too boring or sappy but I have to disagree, I love this season so much! Carrie finally got to concerate on herself rather than a man, even though she does meet Jack Berger halfway through but the writing and stories were sharper than ever. My three favorite episodes are Unoriginal Sin, Luck Be An Old Lady, and The Big Journey. Don't sweat, buy this season today!
B000VBJEEG|4.0|My two year old daughter loves this movie. At least once a day she asks to see \\"mouse,\\" and I typically oblige.    The beginning has a little bit of \\"gun play\\" between a human and rats, and there might be one other scene with mildly frightening content, but all-in-all I think this movie is very youngster-friendly.
B000W1V5VU|3.0|One of the original Ocean's 11 gang (Elliott Gould) is stiffed by a business partner (Al Pacino) and suddenly George Clooney's gang reunites to wreak revenge.  They plan a high tech/hijinks sabatoge of Pacino's new casino in which they turn the opening night into a fiasco.  The plan is complex and multi-faceted and begins to run together in a confusing mess before the film is over.  There are so many stars who need good lines that there are not enough to go around and the plot sputters as a result.  Despite these flaws, there is some fun to be found in the third of the Ocean's 11 series.
0446577391|5.0|If you're a fan of David baldacci and the characters from the camel club -  this is a great book. fast moving, close calls, and revenge is sweet when and how it happens.    In Stone Cold, a LOT of loose ends are tied up. So much so that i wonder if it's the end of the line for the camel club.  I'd call Stone Cold  a bitter sweet thriller. Certainly one of his best.
B0001GMIOE|3.0|[[ASIN:B0001GMIOE Canon BP511A 1390mAh Lithium Ion Battery Pack for Select Digital Cameras and Camcorders]]    What can I say; its like the original, its a canon, and its priced like they're proud of it.  I haven't got up the nerve to purchase an off brand version yet.  My camera gear is too expensive to take a chance.    It would have been 5 stars if the price was right.
B00003CWNR|5.0|If ever a film has maintained it's staying power, it is the John Irving adapted-Lasse Halstrom directed THE CIDER HOUSE RULES.IMO this is the finest adaptation of any of John Irving's many many-paged novels,(THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP,THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE,DOOR IN THE FLOOR and loosely SIMON BIRCH) because Irving,himself,finally adapted his own work to the screen, and because director Lasse Hallstrom (CASANOVA,CHOCOLATE,GILBERT GRAPE,SHIPPING NEWS) has the sensitivity and sensibility to rise to the occasion of such a daunting task.The complex issues that Irving presents in his novel are so effectively and beautifully rendered to the screen and Rachel Portman's soundtrack undergirds all of this with the grace and panache that the material asks.    The story of Homer Wells,orphan,(Tobey Maguire) is taken right from the pages of Dickens' \\"David Copperfield\\". Life is full of choices.There are no right and wrong choices-just choices that have consequences and learned wisdom.Irving's work is always about moral ambiguities, and this is the finest example of his work to date.Rules are made every day! One of the most glorious films ever made!
0156421178|5.0|The Spanish Civil War has long been a myth-like legend of the inherent good in man unifying to fight against the inherent evil.  Orwell exposes how the petty impulses of humanity undermined the leftist coalition of communists and anarchists, leading to internecine struggles which brought ideological cousins to take the blood of one another, something that history shows to have led to the defeat of the Spanish resistance to fascism and the rise of Franco's state.  It is a lesson that should be learned by today's leftists who neurotically mimic the same stupidity, pitting Trotskyists against Stalinists, and Communists against Anarchists.  Historically, the greatest enemy of the far left has been the far left itself.  Perhaps if more leftists read this book, they would resist these petty impulses?<br /><br />Orwell's book is clearly written and conveys with clarity the images of war and human folly.  It is a moving story of personal sacrifice and disappointment.  It proved to be as prophetic about the future of Europe as 1984 proved to be prophetic about our own time.  I would recommend this book for all ages.
B000TEUSJU|4.0|As many have suggested already, the concise history of the man they called Caligula may never be known. Was his father Tiberius murdered? Was it natural causes? Was it Marco? Was it Caligula? Was it the butler?    The movie is one thing and ONE THING ONLY, as ALL MOVIES ARE - ENTERTAINMENT. Can you spell that boys and girls? Entertainment.    Concerning public opinion, refer to the bar graph at the top of the page. This review graph looks like some heavy metal guitarist amplifier's EQ settings - drop the mids. (My apologies to those who don't get it, just ask a musician). In other words, you loved it or you hated it. No in-betweens.    Me??? Well, as heard many times on this review, and lest I not be remembered for my $0.02, I LOVED IT. The VHS, the DVD, The Blue, The freakin Beta version !!!!    ohh.. yea, just my $0.02  -Dave

B000ULQV0W|2.0|But has anything from Pearl Jam been equal to 10? Nope..it's been all downhill since their first release.    Remember the theme song to H.R Puffinstuff? Well you could substitute that song for any song on this album and no one could tell the difference. >Yawn<
B00005JNBQ|4.0|If there ever was a funny movie describing ackward coming of age experiences, this is the one.  We learn about miserly daily life of main character Napoleon Dynamite, who is trying to define his skills as an adult in his rural surroundings.  He is trying to fit in and be able to define himself as a man.  I totally enjoyed his dancing routine during the school's elections for the class president. Napoleon has devoted his heart and soul to having his friend Pedro stay in competition for the class President.  While this is definitely a \\"guy\\" movie, it has many happy moments.  It will make you laugh and you will be happy long after film is over.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I received this DVD very soon after I ordered it and was in very good condition.  Great movie!  I've watched it 3 times already.
B00008H2LB|5.0|LP is incomparable.  They're in a zone of their own.  Unsurpassed in terms of inspiration, force, energy and raw emotion - yet remaining real and accessible.<br /><br />I know nothing about the technicalities of great music making and can't offer clever comments about the different styles on this album, what they are, where they come from, or how they all work perfectly together ... or why.  They just do.  Perfectly.<br /><br />Some of the other reviews offer great insight into - and description of - each track, its style and the techniques used to get certain results.  I just know that I can listen to this album again and again and feel the power of it each time.  The sound moves me; the lyrics are amazing and allow the listener to decide for him/herself what they mean.<br /><br />Listen to the samples, read some of the better reviews, listen to the samples again.<br /><br />Then buy the album.  Listen.<br /><br />It's intense.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I agree with Geddy Lee that this is one of their best albums.  Alex Lifeson stated it was his favorite, Geddy said \\"one of the top three\\".  Excellent record by any standard.

0375836675|5.0|Ed Kennedy is a nineteen-year-old cabdriver. He is a self-proclaimed screw-up. He didn't try hard in school, never went to the University, and only took a job cab-driving because it was easy. He spends all the rest of his time with his extremely smelly 17-year-old dog, The Doorman, or playing cards with Richie, Merv and Audrey -- his best friends and comrades in doing just enough to get by. But all of that changes one day.<br /><br />The four friends had stopped at the bank before going home, and were caught up in the middle of a robbery. After a really inept attempt, the robber tried to flee the scene, and Ed chased after him. He held him until the cops arrived and was thus labeled the local \\"hero\\", a title that was rather unusual to Ed. He wasn't used to the attention. And then it happened. He received a card in the mail. Not just any card, but the Ace of Diamonds. There was nothing on the card, but 3 addresses, with a different time next to each. But what did it mean? What was he supposed to do?<br /><br />Ed didn't have a clue what to do, but Audrey felt that he was chosen for something special because of the robbery. So late one night he arrived at the first address, only to find a very scared wife and daughter that had to endure the torture of a drunken man each night. Ed knew in his heart it was up to him to rescue them, but he wasn't a hero. In fact, he was rather a coward. Would he be able to find the courage to tackle each assignment as it came along? Could he deliver the \\"messages\\" that needed to be sent?<br /><br />To be honest, I knew absolutely nothing about this book when I decided to read it. But I liked The Book Thief, and thought I would give it a try. It turned out to be a very special book....one that touched me very deeply. Have you ever had a book weave it's way into you soul? Deeply, like there was spot there waiting just for that book?? Well, I am the Messenger was the book that did it for me. Ed Kennedy was a wonderfully flawed character.

B00005JPS9|4.0|BEOWULF may be the most mis-advertised movie of the year.  The ads made it look like a CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) adventure for young adults, some sort of 300 for kids.  Actually, Robert Zemeckis' spin on the classic medieval adventure tale of heroism is a grotesque and frightening picture.      It's also the most intense PG-13 in recent memory; probably the fact that it appears to be an animated movie saved it from an R rating.  It shouldn't have, though, because the more adventurous parents taking their kids to see the courageous Beowulf slay the dragon are going to feel like slaying themselves when they see the horrifying, shrieking Grendel (voiced by Crispin Glover), who rips apart most of the villagers in the astounding opening sequence, or when Grendel's mother, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Angelina Jolie, emerges naked from a pool, her naughty bits very, very thinly disguised by specklings of gold.  This is not the bedtime story your parents told you when you were young.  This is the nightmare that came after it.    Truthfully, adults may get more out of the film than children.  It's as much a hopelessly grim morality tale as it is a twisted adventure.  While the kids may be swept away to a land which even Tim Burton would rather avoid, the older members of the audience will be more focused upon the perverse, alienating sexuality which fuels the film.  With this in mind, Jolie is perfectly cast: it's entirely believable that no man can resist her, since, after all, she is among the most gorgeous women who ever lived.  That's why it's all the more terrifying when virtually every man in the movie gives in to her without hesitation - because one can't help but wonder if anyone could resist her.  If there's a message behind BEOWULF, it's that we're all slaves to our own erotic fantasies.  How's that for a new take on the story?     It's actually Jolie's naked body which steals the film, although the motion-capture animation was seeking this effect.The animation has its pros and cons.  On the downside, the film would probably be taken a little more seriously if it was genuine live-action; but on the upside, the animation, which is only a few steps away from looking wholly real, adds a darker sense of fantasy to an already pitch-black picture.  Many have begun proclaiming this motion capture technology as the future of the entertainment industry: after all, one can utilize shots impossible with live-action footage, or age an actor effortlessly and realistically.  Zemeckis is on that boat: he made his first all-CGI picture in 2004, THE POLAR EXPRESS, and he has shown little desire to return to live-action photography.  With this totally-CGI technology, literally anything is possible.  That'll be an exciting thought for some, and a terrifying one for others.    Most of the characters look exactly like the actors that portray them, with the exception of Ray Winstone (playing Beowulf), who looks considerably less rough n' buff in reality.  That doesn't mean he can't roar like a beast, which he does incessantly throughout the film.  Backing him up: Robin Wright Penn as his queen, slender and angelic, and Anthony Hopkins as the king, who has a dark secret.  It's amazing that the CGI imagery can even capture that wise, tired glint in his eye.  Brendan Gleeson plays as his noble and loyal sidekick (last seen in HARRY POTTER as Mad-Eye Moody) and John Malkovich plays a priest, dryly, of course.  Lastly, Alison Lohman plays Beowulf's guilty, dedicated human mistress.    The script, written by noted sci-fi/fantasy writer Neil Gaiman and Quentin Tarantino's old pal Roger Avary (with whom he co-wrote PULP FICTION), has been circulating since 1997, not because it isn't good but because it's not so good without a visual director to bring it to life.  That the director is the man who brought us FORREST GUMP, BACK TO THE FUTURE, and CAST AWAY might seem strange - until one considers some of his other projects, like 1992's blackcomedy DEATH BECOMES HER, or his frequent involvement with the classic HBO horror series TALES FROM THE CRYPT and the feature-film adaptation of the series, 1996's BORDELLO OF BLOOD.  Despite his knack for creating wonderfully uplifting and good-natured pictures, Zemeckis has always dabbled in darkness.  In BEOWULF, he's through dabbling.  He's not peering into the forest anymore; he's walking right into the middle of it and setting up camp in the shadows.    At times, though, the shadows are so dark, it's hard to see much else.  When our hero is being seduced without a fight by the mother of all monsters, one thinks not of the scene and what it means so much as how utterly hopeless and bleak this film is.  The original tale was an adventure story, and a relatively simple one at that: the monster Grendel terrorizes a village, Beowulf slays him, Beowulf slays the monster's mother, Beowulf becomes a king and years later must slay a dragon.  Writers Avary and Gaiman turn it into a morality tale, and then director Zemeckis transforms it into a nightmare.  Those thinking Beowulf is a serious SHREK, or even a tuned-down LORD OF THE RINGS or NARNIA-style adventure, are bound to be horrified: Beowulf has more in common with Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD trilogy than those films.    BEOWULF also shares a connection with the recent SIMPSONS MOVIE, as well as, of all things, MELROSE PLACE.  During his thrilling confrontation with Grendel, Beowulf strips himself of all his clothing (\\"We shall fight as equals,\\" he says, because after all, Grendel doesn't shop at the Gap), his genitalia concealed by an impressive variety of objects - much as Bart Simpson's own privates were in THE SIMPSONS MOVIE, and also much like Heather Locklear's pregnant stomach was through the sixth season of MELROSE PLACE.      That's about as light as the film gets, though.  Robert Zemeckis takes the medieval legend and turns it into a Grimm fairytale.  One can put the blame for the disturbing sexuality of the picture on the writers, the director, and to a lesser degree, Angelina Jolie (did she ask to give Aphrodite a run for her money?); the new twists in the story can be attributed to Neil Gaiman, and the bloody violence no doubt comes from Roger Avary (who last wrote the similarly-eerie SILENT HILL).  If BEOWULF was advertised correctly, it probably wouldn't anywhere near as riveting as it actually is.  But thanks to misleading ads, BEOWULF ranks as one of the most pleasantly surprising, violatingly disturbing, and refreshingly original films of the year.
B000HIVO64|5.0|What an awesome listen!  Especially Soldier Jane and Think I'm in Love.  The entire cd is some major funky fun.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I personally believe that this is the best album yet. Some of the traditionalist nightwish fans may disagree but I actually prefer the new lead singer to Tarja. Her voice, I think, adds a pleasant new sound to the already amazing nightwish sound.
B000WTNCQS|2.0|The original CD itself is a 5-star IMO and one of my top 10 favorite albums/CD. However, I have listened to the LP (bought in 1987) and original CD of this a many many times. When I put the remastered version from this box set I don't hear much improvement. The DVD concert in Paris in 1987 is AMAZING (That alone I would give a 5-star). I'm not crazy about the documentary and will probably never watch it again. The videos are okay. The B-sides are cool and interesting. The book and essays is 5-star. The additional photos are filler IMO. I would have preferred to buy the DVD separately and save about $20 bucks. The box set is a must for U2 fans. My suggestion for people not sure about U2, or not familiar with this era of U2, borrow the DVD from a friend. One of the best live shows I have ever seen.
0767821629|2.0|The premise of the movie sounded good, the opening scenes were interesting and built what seemed like it was going to be an interesting premise, but the film quickly devolved into complete junk, with a twist ending so weak that it made the already mediocre film into a truly bad one.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|On the surface, Dexter is about a forensic expert (blood-splatter specialist) by the day turning into a very skillful (dexterous?) serial killer during the night. So, always soft-spoken and well-mannered on his day job, thus trusted and liked by most of his colleagues, he is portrayed in such a way that he should give creeps for those with discerning eyes. In Season 1, detective Doakes is one with such eyes, but he is the only one, and Dexter never fails to come off as a quiet and gentle, if a tad mildly eccentric, absolutely harmless guy, to everyone including his sister Deb and his girlfriend Rita.<br /><br />What's at first very interesting is that there is no character transformation involved, that is, Dexter the serial killer behaves in essentially the same way as Dexter the forensic expert. It's not as if he has two selves, one normal, the other pervert. As his voice-overs constantly remind us, he is a \\"monster,\\" day or night, who has perfected the art of faking human interaction. He perfected this art through years of hard training given by his foster father, Harry Morgan, who himself as a detective at the Miami Police Department picked Dexter up at a crime scene when he was just 4. Harry Morgan correctly sees that Dexter is a 'natural born killer,' and trains him to use his instincts and talents for, for ... a good cause. That is, of course, to kill off the slimes masquerading as humans, who are often themselves murderers, plus being criminals of heinous sorts, child molestation and such. Dexter's genius (which is, \\"passion\\") for killing is tempered with his father's ethically informed training and he becomes a serial killer with unmatched perfectionism, and \\"integrity.\\"<br /><br />Such should be enough to make an intelligent and entertaining show. Yet Dexter does much more. For one thing, it is a study of, well, the whole idea of the human and human nature. By portraying Dexter as a \\"neat monster\\" who can behave in much more humanly way than the \\"normal\\" people around him, notions of normality and perversion are called into question. When, for instance, he confesses his puzzlement over the obscene joke (\\"When doing in a doggie style, call out a name of another woman when she gets all worked up. Then...\\") gleefully shared by his male colleagues, in these words--\\"I sometimes think I'm missing all the important pieces to the puzzle of the human. This may be one of them\\"--the cruelty, inhumanity even, in a garden-variety woman-hating joke is suddenly made clear.<br /><br />Along this line of being a serious study of human nature, Dexter is also filled with insights into a variety of human lationships: romantic, father-son, mother-son, brother-sister, colleague to colleague, superior to inferior, or ... simply as a human being to another human being. Michael C. Hall was an excellent choice for Dexter, although his hidden creepiness doesn't really realize. (To me, he is at least still David from Six Feet Under, with all his repressed sweetness, total innocuous quality intact). Perhaps that part of his character wasn't really meant to realize. Another notable Six Feet Under alumnus is Michael Cuesta, whose very indie film L.I.E. made SFU producers Alan Ball and Alan Poul ask him to direct several episodes of the show.m, notions of normality and perversion are called into question.

0307346617|5.0|I am an avid fan of zombie and apocalyptic horror of all types of media, but I have never been so engulfed in a novel of the type as this.  The point of the book is as a government report (refused by the powers that be) turned into a novel to better place the human element of a world war against the living dead after the rebirth of a new world, complete with a new found love for the simple things.  I gave this book to my sister (who is not a zombie buff by the way) who is in her last year of college as a Sociology major.  I gave her the book because of the intelligent implications into her field that the book so cleverly touches.  She loved it as well.  I also want to point out that there is an Audio CD version of this book that I listened to after reading the book.  It has opened me up to a whole world of Audio Books on CD.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED as well, but read the book first!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Anyone who thought Bruce Springsteen might have nothing new to offer should think again. The songs on his new CD, Magic, are far more thoughtful--haunting, really--than his earlier work. The title song, in particular, has an almost menacing edge to it that is hard to miss. It opens with a dark reversal of calliope-like strains that hint at what's to come, and the magician's illusions the song describes become more and more menacing as the song proceeds. It is hard not to read this song's musical and lyrical sleights of hand as political commentary, especially when followed by a song that asks \\"who'll be the last to die for a mistake.\\" Yet, although much of this new work seems to offer a cautionary tale, there's still room for a sliver of hope, reinforced by strains of such songs as \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes,\\" and \\"Living in the Future,\\" in which we are reassured that \\"none of this has happened yet.\\"  The music on Magic has enough of Springsteen's familiar rhythms to keep long-time fans more than satisfied, and its reflective, at times melancholy, underpinnings are enough to keep you awake in the middle of the night.
0142000655|5.0|I hadn't read any Steinbeck since high school and I didn't remember liking him all that much. But East of Eden was highly recommended to me so I decided to give it a go.  I have to say I liked it. I then watched the movie and boy, was that a lot different. But I liked it too in its own way.    The story is really a timeless one and essentially a retelling of Cain and Abel times two. And if you don't have a knack for the Biblical symbolism, well Steinbeck screams it at you every chance he gets ( I think Cal actually says, \\"Am I my brother's keeper\\"). I was worried about how it would end but I thought it did so very well.

1400032717|5.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time  By Mark Haddon    This was a great book.  The author puts in a huge amount of detail  into each chapter making the book very easy to understand.  The way he  does it is great, because he put his own ways of doing things into the  book.  It is a story of an autistic boy who tries to find out who  killed a dog.  This story ends up with him heading to London England  on a great adventure.  The end kind of drags on a little, but its  still the best book I've read for 3 months.  I would recommend this  book to anybody from the ages of 13 - 100.

B000EHSVSC|5.0|20th Century Fox's genuinely spectacular account of the attack on Pearl Harbor told from both the American and Japanese viewpoints was in real terms an even bigger financial disaster for the studio than Cleopatra: even by latter-period roadshow standards, reminding American audiences of the incredible catalogue of blunders and incompetence that led to the Day of Infamy at a time when they were in the midst of another war in Asia (and one that was not going well) seems like business decision making at its most kamikaze. The film has probably made more money out of being carved up for stock footage than it ever did in the cinema, featuring prominently in Midway, Pearl and both The Winds of War and War and Remembrance among others.     Like Cleopatra, it was a troubled production: Akira Kurosawa worked on the Japanese side of the film for months but delivered only one brief scene in the finished film before being replaced by two more special effects friendly directors (Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasaku) while on the American side Richard Fleischer relied on Ray Kellog and Robert Enrietto to shoot much of the spectacular finale.     From the last days when films were consciously visually designed for the Scope screen, it is mounted on a scale that would be inconceivable today - what Pearl Harbor did with CGi it did with real ships and aircraft - with a tight, focused script that dispenses with fictional sub-plots (no Ben Affleck winning the Battle of Britain single-handed here) in favour of absolute historical accuracy. Seen entirely from the military and political mindset, it has the edge on most cinematic exercises in battlefield history through the conviction of its direction, particularly the visually impressive Japanese sequences, and of its playing. With the exception of Soh Yamamura and E.G. Marshall, most of the top-liners are barely in the film, but the large ensemble cast copes surprisingly well with the task of having to embody attitudes and impart informationrather than working on clearly defined characters, adding the colour as they find it in the gaps. Perhaps most surprising is the incredible degree of tension the film manages to achieve in the run-up to the attack despite the inevitability of the outcome. When it finally comes, the special effects are among the best ever seen on the screen. Jerry Goldsmith's score is also a major plus, relentlessly building menace and tension as the film races toward the inevitable.     While the previous DVD issue was pretty threadbare, the two-disc edition has a number of features covering both the making of the film and the real attack itself.

How great to see them perform classics such as Close to the Edge, Gates of Delerium, Starship Troopers, Ritual and Roundabout.  And the symphony adds a great touch to both the sound and visuals (and there's one cute brunette clarinet player who, when not playing, is often caught bopping to the music...fun to see).
0345494997|5.0|This book was a wonderful read - written beautifully, and the story was captivating.  It was even more so to me since it was historically accurate, and portrayed a difficult personal choice, especially considering the times.  It is interesting to see and try to understand the power of \\"genius\\" that lay with in FLW, and the suposed subjugation of \\"genius\\" that was expected of Mamah, because she was a woman, and had \\"higher obligations\\".  The torment she lived with was well portrayed, and the price she paid completely understood.  And yet above all, there was a power of love that was not to be stopped.  The ending was unexpected, and a show stopper.  I particularly enjoyed this as I am from Chicago, knew Oak Park well, and grew up in a suburb that had several FLW homes.    I hope others enjoy this as much as I did - have passed on my copy, recommended endlessly, and bought as gifts.

B000002GVO|4.0|The classic title track lifts what is essentially a three-star album into four-star territory.  The first half (what used to be known as \\"side one\\", kids) is better than the last half, although the last track ends things with a bang, not a whimper.  A little too much Henley (and not enough Frey) for my tastes, but it's a minor point.
B000RJO578|5.0|Simon Pegg and Nick Frost of SHAUN OF THE DEAD are back in this film of a spoof of a buddy cop blockbuster. Simon Pegg plays a London police officer that is so good at his job that he is forced to transfer to an assignment in the country in order to no longer make the rest of the officers in London look incompetent. Once in the country he is paired off with Nick Frost who plays a sad sack of the little village's police force who only has his job because his father is the chief of police.    For a spoof this is a well-produced action adventure film. They have made good use of their bigger budget and this films R-rating comes from strong language. Even so this is fun to watch as the action picks up in the small and idyllic village of Sandford. A series of murders start Pegg's character investigating them though all others in the village believe they are just a series of accidents.    There are many clichés and homage's to other films, they are so numerous I could not possible list them. You will also see and hear references to their previous movie, SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Watch the movie and try to keep track of them. A funny spoof filled with action and worth watching.

0141439610|5.0|I don't mind admitting that I discovered this book because I had read that Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker named their child Wilkie after Wilkie Collins, an author I had never heard of.  I am a huge a Dickens fan, and when I read of his and Collins' connection after doing a little research, I bought the book, and I'm so glad I did.  The reading experience I got from this book was off the charts.  This work of art must rank--in its intricate plot, jaw-dropping language, and overall perfect execution--with Dickens' best and even the Russians.  Certainly this book  doesn't have the philosophical ambition of War and Peace, but, you know, who said genius and entertainment are mutually exclusive?  While reading the book I stopped several times to close the book and look at the cover and just marvel at the experience I was having, savoring the pleasure and admiration I had for such a brilliant, brilliant piece of literature.   Many paragraphs of the book I re-read dozens of the time and were better written than most books I'll read in a year.  And when Count Fosco appeared in the heroine's journal, I was genuinely frightened.  It was as uncannily like the moment in Rear Window when Raymond Burr finally looks up and sees Jimmy Stewart--and me, the viewer--for the first time.  I wish The Moonstone had been as good, a book which is strangely more revered and famous than this one.  But for anyone out there who enjoys the act of reading and stories told in beautiful language, I just can't say enough about the experience you are going to have.  Every single note is so, so, so perfect.  If you're not swept up in the first ten pages, well, send your copy to me and I'll read it again myself.

Track 1 is Tom Petty's \\"I Won't Back Down\\" Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers support on this one, and it's a great song to show that Cash, even at age 68, still has the same power in his voice(back in the 50's it was like a freight train, they used to say.    Track 2 is Neil Diamonds classic, \\"Solitary Man\\". Being a Neil Diamond fan myself, I'm sorry to say Cash's cover of his most famous song is better than Diamond ever did it. Tom Petty also sings on this one,and the guitar work is just great.    The third track is \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\". It's a melancholy song about a family man trying to work for his family. This one has an atmosphere about it a really enjoy. It's slow and and easy. Good song.    Track 4 is U2's One. The guitar work is wonderful, and the piano is good as well. This is one my favorites.It's a song I never really enjoyed I heard Cash sing it. Now it's one of my favorite songs of all time.    No album is perfect, and track 5 certainly isn't. I'm sorry, don't get me wrong, I love this album, but this song is just plain bad. Cash isn't bad, the accompanist's aren't bad, it's just a bad song. It's a song about a guy with no friends, or something. I only listened to it twice    Track 6 is \\"I See a Darkness\\". Merle Haggard sings with Johnny on this one, and it's hauntingly beatiful. It's a dark, depressing song about two good friends who became enemies. This right on, man, love it.    Nick Cave's \\"The Mercy Seat\\" is track number 7. If this was the only song in the whole album, it would still be worth every penny I paid for it. That's how good this song is, it's definitely my favorite of the whole CD.  It's about a man who is wrongly imprisoned and charged with murder he didn't commit. In jail, he comes to a knowledge of God, amd later realizes he was guilty. It's powerful song, a sure 10/10    A harsh challenge to a lover makes up track number 8, \\"Would You Lay With Me\\". This is a solo by Cash, it's just him and his guitar. I enjoyed it very much, though I thought it didn't really belong in the album.    Johnny Cash and Sheryl Crow sing a song that Cash wrote, Track 9 \\"Field Of Diamonds\\". A song to sing while your looking up at the stars one night. Jack Routh and Johnny wrote that song while doing just that.    I'm running out of room here so instead of a full description I'll give you a ranking for the next few    \\"Before my Time\\" 2/5  Country Trash\\" 4/5  \\"Mary of the Wild Moor\\" 1/5  \\"I'm Leavin' Now\\"  4/5  \\"Wayfaring Stranger\\" 4/5    \\"Solitary Man\\" is a great album and a worthy addition to your music library, not only because of the great songs, but also because of the depth of each one. Whether your'e a rock'n'roll, country, or pop fan, you'll find something to like in this album.
B00011RPB0|4.0|The deserving winner of the Best Original Screenplay, this film is unlike almost every American film of the past decade.  Sharing more in common with the films of Jean-Luc Godard or Wong Kar-Wai, \\"Lost in Translation\\" marches to its own beat.  And Bill Murrary has never revealed his soul more openly.  A true gem.
B0000DJZ8R|1.0|This review has nothing to do with the movie.  The movie was fine.  The problem was the DVD.  On the back cover of the DVD, they list 10 different special features listed.  There are only two special features, and I considered them very boring.  The two \\"Special Features\\" you will get is a Steinbeck historian/Depression Era historian giving oral commentary over the film as you watch it (oh....what fun), the second feature is an extremely brief prologue of the movie to the UK (as if people in the UK had never heard of the Great Depression!).  The missing features would have been very interesing, as another customer has noted about this DVD.  If you chose to buy this DVD, be aware that there are really none of the special features that we DVD buyers have become accustomed to.  Very disappointing.

B000003TAR|5.0|If you could only buy one Nirvana studio-album, this is it!!! I am a huge Nirvana fan, love all of their stuff. If this was the only album that they had ever made... I'd still consider them better than The Doors any day! Best track: Scentless Apprentice.... enjoy ;-)
B0000074FL|5.0|I came across this CD by chance in a records' shop in Madrid, my hometown. They were playing it, and although I am not a fan of hard rock, I loved it.     An incredible CD ! Listen to it and enyoy it!
B00026WU7I|2.0|Fair album. About as good as Highway 61 Revisited.   What annoys about his writing is the way he tosses in mindless lyrics that have nothing to do with  ANYTHING...but the guy does it because he needs a rhymer. Way to go, Bob. You've gotten away with it for decades--and those who worship the ground you walk on don't know any better.    To be honest, I have liked some of this man's work: Knockin' On Heaven's door is a clasic; have liked TIME OUT OF MIND, have liked THE ESSENTIAL BOB DYLAN; think his CHRONICLES is a fine autobiography...I just don't happen to think every time the man sneezes that it should be hailed as a work of genius and/or a masterpiece.    My  2 cents.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael's voice is out of this world and the type of music he sings is timeless. I would recommend his music to everybody. I also enjoy different styles of music he sings.
B00026WU82|2.0|Album way over-rated by the worshippers. This guy breaks wind and the sycophants can't wait to praise it to the sky.  Want to buy a great album by this singer/songwriter? Get THE ESSENTIAL BOB DYLAN. Want to read something truly terrific by him? Get CHRONICLES, Volume One.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|There is a married couple who both have good jobs, the husband has multiple heart attacks and the wife gets cancer. They can't afford to live in their house anymore and need to switch between living with each of their kids. A woman gets in a car accident and is unconscious but is taken in an ambulance. Her insurance does not approve the ambulance bill because it was not pre-approved.  How could she have called when she was unconscious? This and other heart wrenching tales of people being denied health care, being forced into bankruptcy or losing their limbs or their lives because of our medical system.<br /><br />A little bit of history of our medical system is shown.  Creation of Health Maintenance Organizations in the 1970s led to less care and more people being denied medical treatment to make healthcare in America a for-profit system.  HMO's were introduced by Edgar Kaiser to Richard Nixon. HMOs were pushed by various brain washing techniques like sending out disks telling people if we get socialized medicine, everyone has access to medical care then doctors will have no freedom. Doctors won't be able to practice in the city they choose to.  The brain washing was done by none other then B-level Hollywood actor- Ronald Reagan<br /><br />Various people in the Medical industry do speak out. One former executive physician is shown in CSPAN saying a person who needed medical treatment was denied because it would save the company half a million dollars. After he was denied, he died.  And the executive physician moved up in the company.<br /><br />Moore travels to the England, France and Canada and compares their medical system to ours. In England people laugh in the hospital when Moore asks what their medical bill will be. In France he sits down with some expatriate Americans living in France and asks them about the healthcare and lifestyle. One woman says she has four boys and France is a very family friendly country in regards to healthcare, paid time off and childcare.<br /><br />One of the most touching scenes in the movie is when Moore and some 9/11 rescue workers travel to Cuba.  In Cuba medical is available to everyone. Even though Cuba is a very poor country, they make sure to spend their money on making sure everyone is taken care of. In the movie, it is briefly mentioned that Cuba is very generous with their doctors. This is true, for example, Cuban doctors were sent to Indonesia after the Tsunami and to Pakistan after the earthquake and they were appreciated in both countries (not mentioned in the movie.)<br /><br />I saw this movie in the theater and bought the DVD. The DVD has some good special features like \\"this country beats France\\".<br /><br />This movie shows that despite the greedy, corrupt and for-profit face that we show the rest of the world, some generous and heroic people in America do exist.touching scenes in the movie is when Moore and some 9/11 rescue workers travel to Cuba.

B000V6BE6C|5.0|I don't know how anyone could NOT like this album. I guess maybe those metal heads who have yet to move out of their parents' basements and broadened their horizons a little bit. :-)      As should be clear from other reviews its all over the place musically, but somehow it all works and flows well. Every tune is hard edged, catchy, and musically brilliant. I wish I had half the talent these guys carry in their pinky fingers.      A7X have pulled out way ahead for me as best band of the \\"triple oughts\\", an other-wise duldrum decade for rock that has forced me to look towards other genres for music. Guess, they've done the same and it shows in this album. EXCELLENT!
0143038419|1.0|I tried to like this book... I wanted to like this book... I could not finish this book.  The only thing I appreciated was her sense of humor at times.  She seems self-centered and completely unaware of others needs.  I really question her great ability to make friends.  On one level I can see that she could be a great person to have at a party with many entertaining stories etc. but I define \\"friend\\" differently -<br />she doesn't seem like she would be a dear faithful friend, someone you could count on in times of trouble (although I'm sure she'd make it for the good times).  She seems unstable and flighty.  It is probably a wise decision for her not to have children.  Also in regards to her husband... sounds like a very painful time for him but it's probably for the best that she's moved on.  I hope he can heal and find peace.
0307341550|5.0|...and I appreciate a dark worldly view so I loved this first novel. The main character is nothing like you've seen before and there is even a surprise ending. The author took a lot of chances in creating her main character and I applaud the courage it took to make her sooo godawful flawed. The basic plot is: very troubled reporter goes to her hometown to investigate some ghastly murders and comes face to face with her own ghoulish family. Southern Gothic all the way. I raced through it because it was so well-written and suspenseful.
0143038419|4.0|I have always loved Barbar Kingsolver's books and this is no exception. The book deals with the family living with minimal outside resources.
B000ZN8036|5.0|This is the first film I have seen in a very long time that was well worth the wait. It took over 12 years for this film to be made by Sean Penn.  It is based on the book which was written with insight from the true diary of a young man played by Emile Hirsch. The true life character Chris Leaves the norm of society life for a life of adventure and spiritual awakening which will cost him his physical life. The message of this film is that happiness is within no matter what the outward situation in life. Live life to the fullest from the heart and in death you will live on.  This film is nothing short of an oscar winner in my heart and is this years best film for 2007 in my opinion.  I do not want to spoil what this film has to offer by giving a long detailed description. If you are on a path to spiritual realization this film will truely touch the depth of your soul.  I have not been able to get this film out of my head.  Very few films have hit the core of my being as this one did.  I have seen this film twice in theaters and await the DVD. Thank You Sean Penn for making this incredible film. If anyone rates this film less than 5 stars then they did not even come close to the great spiritual depth and truth this film has to offer.
B00003CWTI|1.0|Worst movie I ever seen. Rent it in the local library then bring a date you do not like to watch it. Better yet find 3 hours of something better to do. What a waste of 3 hours of my life that I can never ever get it back.
B000002G0P|5.0|I am a REALLY big Extreme fan. This CD is just as good as the other too. But for some reason lots of people hated this CD. I don't know why. I heard that this CD was the most returned CD of all time!!! Thats crazy this Album is great. Songs like \\"Warheads\\" and Rest In Peace\\" are great. If you are an Extreme fan like me I wouldent pass this CD up.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|Zac Efron, Vanessa Anne Hudgens, and Kenny Ortega are this generation's Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, and Busby Berkeley. In this 2nd installment of the High School Musical franchise, Troy & Gabriella return in colors that pop off the screen (reminiscent of Technicolor), songs that stick in your head, and plot complications where nobody actually gets hurt. The chemistry between the leads is definitely there; you really believe that Troy & Gabriella are made to be together. The story is pretty predictable; the gang gets jobs together at a country club where self-centered Sharpay (played to excellence by Ashley Tisdale) reigns supreme as a member. You can guess it...this time around, she sets her sights on Zac and attempts to bring him into her world (think Caddyshack snobs) and break up his relationship with Gabriella so that she (Sharpay) can sing with Troy at the Country Club's annual talent show. The choreography is fantastic; the way that sports are integrated into the dancing (this time it's baseball) is something that Gene Kelly would have been proud of. From the opening number (What Time is It?\\"), it is hard not to get caught up in the innocent fun of this movie. Many tributes abound to MGM musicals...even Esther Williams gets a nod in some of the pool numbers. The movie is slightly over the top at times, but never to the point where it's not enjoyable and fun. The DVD has a few extras: some fun bloopers, sneak previews, music videos, and karaoke. The best part for those who love dance are the rehearsal to final number views, which allow you to see how the number grows and becomes the rip-roaring sequence that we see in the final film. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it's disappointing that the film isn't in widescreen for the DVD release, but a small point; neither were Mickey & Judy's films! NOTE: Now that it's available, I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B001BKZDB4 High School Musical 2 Deluxe Dance Edition]]!
B000BH4YFE|5.0|First of all I would like to say that Marc Bolan has a really cool voice. His voice stands out from any other singer. This whole disc is full of great songs like \\"Metal Guru\\", \\"Rabbit Fighter,\\" \\"Main Man\\" and of cource the best track on here the tital track \\"The Slider.\\" This is a great CD. Pick this up today. R.I.P. Marc.
B000U1ZVD0|5.0|It is refreshing to see a western film done with such objectivity.  The characters are real and are all that more interesting to watch because they are represented as family people who, along with performing what would become legendary deeds, are just trying to get through their everyday lives and relationships.  I admire Costner's films because he keeps his characters real and leaves the epic filmaking to the cameraman and the landscape he is shooting.  It is no wonder that this film is worth seeing in high definition.  The extra features are informative additions and are worth watching.
B000002GIE|5.0|This is one of meny CDs that didn't get the attention it sould have got. Every song on this CD is great. But the highlights are \\"Mutha\\", \\"Big Boys Don't Cry\\" and \\"Play with me\\". \\"Mutha\\" has an AMAZING guitar intro in the beginning. Nuno Bettencourt was influenced by Brian May and Eddie Van Halen and the cool thing about influence is that \\"Mutha\\" sounds like a mix between Brian and Eddie. Lastly Ive got to say that Nuno is a god at playing guitar. If you are a fan of hair metal and early Van Halen I am sure that you will like this CD.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|My husband is a Star Trek fan so I bought this for my husband's birthday. He was so excited when it was delivered. When he put the 1st DVD in the DVD player and saw the quality, he said,\\"Wow, this is even better than I expected; I love it! Thank you sooooo much, baby!\\" He loves the digital remastering, picture clarity, different angles for the spaceship and space shots. It was worth every penny to see the look of joy and excitement on his face. Now he is asking me when the 2nd Season Set will be available. Of course, I will be getting him the other 2 seasons when they become available.

B000GCFO0I|3.0|This movie was a major dissapointment to Silent Hill fans all over. If you have never heard of Silent Hill before you've seen this, you are lucky. I'm not saying that the movie was really bad or anything, it's just...come on! I'm one of the hugest silent Hill fans to ever grace this earth! I was expecting it to be like the movie. I understand that most movies are never exactly like the game or book, but I wasn't expecting this. In the videogame [[ASIN:B00001XDUB Silent Hill]], there is a man, Harry Manson, searching for his daughter Cheryl in the town of Silent Hill after he swerved on the road trying to avoid a girl in the road, after he woke up in the car to find her missing. There's the first problem. In this movie, there is a married couple. The lady, Rose, takes her daughter to silent hill because this girl has been having nightmares and doing weird things all drawn in by this abandoned town. The plot, and alot of things in the movie don't even exist in the game.  This movie was produced by an english company. They called the infamous Pyramid Head, \\"red pyramid\\" which disapointed me greatly.    All in all the movie was okay. It wasn't what I expected, but It still keeps the eerie silent hill feeling. You'll probably like it. If you become interested in Silent Hill from seeing this movie, try the games. My favorite is [[ASIN:B0001Y7404 Silent Hill 4:  The Room]].
0810993139|5.0|DIARY OF A WIMPY KID just made my list of Top 10 Books of 2007.  After listening to my fourth grader rave about the book, which he found on the internet of all places because it's been published there, I ordered a hardcover edition of the book.  I know that kids who find a book they love will read it over and over again, and the choice as a parent is whether to buy it in hardcover or buy it in paperback over and over.  Since paperbacks don't always stay in print and hardcovers sometimes appreciate dramatically in price, I opted for the hardcover copy.<br /><br />It came in today.  My son sat down with it immediately.  Even though he'd read the whole book on the internet, he loved the idea of being able to hold it in his hands.  He flipped through the pages and made certain all his favorite jokes were still in place, which was amusing to watch because I've done the same thing.<br /><br />One of the amazing things I've learned since is that the whole book is available on the internet.  You can find it at [...]  Feel free to preview the whole book if you like, the author has generously placed it there, but it's gone on to be a #1 seller in hardcover and paperback all the same.  Free on the internet is one thing, but books and portability are best.<br /><br />Since most of the television shows my wife and I watch on Friday nights were suspended or repeats and I needed a mental vacation after the stress of pounding the keyboard all day, I picked up DIARY OF A WIMPY KID and started turning pages.  I didn't stop till I'd devoured the last page.<br /><br />The book is a flat-out laugh riot from page one to page 217.  With pencil drawings that look like they were made by an early elementary school student, it was also an incredibly fast read.<br /><br />The story is about Greg Heffley, which is kind of like Jeff Kinney if you look at it right.  Greg's in sixth grade and isn't exactly a social butterfly or even much accepted by the other kids.  In fact, he's lucky if they notice he's alive.<br /><br />Greg's got a regular mom and dad, but Jeff Kinney paints them so vividly with just little details that you can't help feeling you know these people.  His dad has a violent streak when it comes to punishing Greg on the spot.  Greg even points out when there are good  times to screw up and bad times to screw up.  Hint:  a good time is when his dad is reading the paper; a bad time is when his dad is building a brick wall.  Line drawings accompany this.  Greg's also got an older and younger brother that helps drive him crazy at home.  The younger brother, Manny, doesn't really speak, but he's into everything.<br /><br />Greg's older brother, Rodrick, has his own band and generally stays out of Greg's life.  However, the relationship between the two comes to the forefront every now and again.  Rodrick doesn't mind putting something over on Greg or making him look bad.<br /><br />The things that make this book work the most, and kept me turning pages, are Greg's insights on life.  He's not a good kid.  He's not a bad kid either.  He's just a kid.  One part scared, one part \\"that's not fair\\", and one part selfish.  It's the selfish part of Greg that brings about observations about popularity, such as his acknowledgement that he's number fifty-something popular among the boys, but he's due to move up a spot because one of the other boys is about to get braces.<br /><br />His efforts to get out of trouble without having to actually take responsibility for his actions are amazingly dead-on for the age group Kinney is writing about.  The fact that Greg's unwilling to give up trick or treating is good.  The touchstones of elementary school life, like the Cheese that's haunted the outdoor basketball court for a year and gave birth to the Cheese Touch myth that actually ended up making one kid movie way, are here as well.<br /><br />There are literally hundreds of reasons to buy this book.  Number one is that it is the perfect gift for kids who are reluctant readers.  Christmas is upon us.  Kids are going to be thrown in cars for trips to see relatives, and this book will guarantee some quiet time - except for snickers and outright belly laughs.<br /><br />I had an absolute blast with it.  Before I knew it, I was committing the unpardonable sin of reading sections aloud to my wife while she was watching television.  Normally I enforce that one to keep my own television watching manageable.  However, I was soon that guy.  The book is just too good not to share, so here I am sharing it with you.<br /><br />Do your kid a favor and go buy the book.  But make time to read it yourself.  This is one that I think a lot of people will read and tell friends about.  Then mark February 2008 down as the release month of the second book, DIARY OF A WIMPY KID: RODRICK RULES.  I've already got mine on order.rips to see relatives, and this book will guarantee some quiet time - except for snickers and outright belly laughs.    I had an absolute blast with it.

The killers had next to no remorse and they cared not of their worried-sick families. I also recall families watching the news about the hostages being safe and then being slaughtered.

B0002M3V0C|4.0|This is better than Green Day's Dookie, Incubus' first 3 CDs (the putrid Fungus Amongus, overrated to the High Heavens, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and the sporadically magical Make Yourself). It's also a tad better than Make Yourself by the same band.<br /><br />This is the Maroon 5 that I miss. True that it's still TOO, too early to hear their signature sound, seeing as they've just released a second disc in May 2007, but I still can't help but wonder what pressure caused them to \\"suit up\\" (literally) and take themselves WAY too seriously?!?!?!<br /><br />It confuses, angers and saddens me, all in one try!<br /><br />I miss songs such as Harder To Breathe, She Will Be Loved, Tangled, The Sun, Through With You and my favorite, the sexy and sultry, Secret.<br /><br />I have the import version, with mixes of This Love.

B000FVQLQQ|5.0|[[ASIN:1430326956 Liebestr&auml;ume]]<br /><br />I have heard of John Forbes Nash for some time, but I never fully realized what this great man has accomplished in his life. Besides being a true mathmatical genius, he has managed to \\"set aside\\" one of the most horrible mental illnesses known to man -- schizophrenia -- and do his outstanding work! I find his amazing abilities to see patterns in math, etc. no less than mind-boggling, as well as the fact that he has been granted, at overwhelming odds, the honor of one of the most prestigious awards that can be bestowed upon a man or woman! It is almost beyond comprehension. I more than enjoyed this movie and the superb acting by all the stars. I intend to buy my own copy of this splendid movie, and I also want to know more about this great man.
0743482883|3.0|I am a big Linda Howard fan, and elements of this novel were certainly entertaining.  On the whole however, this is my least favorite L.H. novel to date.      It is hard to put a finger on exactly why this novel failed to jell for me.  I did not find the smart-aleck heroine to be all that interesting or sympathetic.  The national furor generated by \\"The List\\" also seemed thin to me.   The relationship between hero & heroine felt a little flat - some of the initial dialogue struck me as far-fetched rather than sexy, and it was hard to buy their sudden profound love and commitment to each other.      It was worth reading once (or twice), but I don't think it is going to remain in my permanent Linda Howard collection.
0143036556|5.0|This book gives an in-depth examination of both ancient and modern societies reviewing how the societies started, developed, and ultimately either succeeded or failed.  Knowing what the earlier societies faced and how they dealt with them demonstrates that some problems are universal and do not always have a set response.<br /><br />A very eye-opening part of the narrative is when he speaks of the Norse settlements on the coast of Greenland and how he shows that societies can be motivated by other causes than self-preservation which can lead to the society failing for reasons that it did not need to.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to look beyond the history books (for ancient societies) or the newspaper headlines (for current societies) for understanding the underlying causes and effects of these societies.
0920668372|4.0|I got this as a shower gift when I had my son. The person that gave it to me said she read this to her daughter almost every day (when dd was little).  I read it to my son (who is now 6) and I laughed so hard I cried. That book has one creepy mom in it. It is the most hilarious thing I have ever read to a kid (because it's super cheesey and weird). It's supposed to be sentimental and sweet, but I didn't take it that way. The first time I read it when my son was really small, my husband and I kept laughing at how ridiculous it was. It is super fun to read just for the laughs it gives me and my husband. Sorry to those who are sentimentally attached to the book. I don't mean disrespect to you.
0143038419|1.0|Thank goodness the book had three sections.  The 1st & third were ok but the middle section on her journey for spritual enlightenment in India was like pulling teeth.  Thought it would never end it went on & on.  I always finish books I start but not this one.  Save yourself the time.
B000002UA0|5.0|This .. Pink Floyds first lp shows troubled Singer/Songwriter Syd Barrett at his top! Not to be confused with the latter Pink Floyds space rock ..This lp has all the grit and grime of 1960's garage psych BUT with a sophistication and depth never found again in the psychedelic rock world..Not just a great \\"psych\\" record but simply one of the greatest rock records of all time !@
0962477060|5.0|I wish I'd had this book when I started \\"playing\\" 30 years ago, but I'm glad I found it when I did about 5 yrs ago. Using it at least tripled my understanding and ability in less than a month, and I'm still working with the book.  As one of the other reviewers said,  you have to apply the information and practice - why would it be different from any other skill - algebra, golf, writing, etc. ?  I also study instructional dvds by, e.g., Ernie Hawkins, Kenny Sultan, James Burton, Danny Gatton.  They all complement each other. One thing about the traditional way of learning is that you don't learn barre chords or different positions or inversions, and it gets boring playing House of the Rising Sun on the first three frets over and over.
B000777J2S|5.0|This is an awesome album. I can understand why some people don't like it. It's not everyone's cup of tea. Overall, I would say it takes some getting used to, but once you do, every song is perfect!
B000Y179KO|4.0|28 years after their last studio album, the Eagles return to the studio with Long Road Out of Eden. Instead of releasing a single disc set, they band choose to release a double disc set. The Long Road out of Eden is good, and Eagles fans will enjoy it. How Long is my personal favorite from the new Eagles album.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|I saw the moviecast of this production. For those who don't know, the moviecast was a live performance of a matinee at the Met in New York shown in movie theatres across the country; it had almost all the excitement of being in the Met itself for this unforgettable performance. I just wish I too had a program to tear up and rain confetti down on the singers as the audience at the Met did. Yes, it was that great a performance.    This is a lushly romantic opera about unrequited love and deserves to be far better known than it is.    As for the performance, it's one for the ages and I count myself lucky to have seen the moviecast. I agree with the previous reviewer about the spare sets not always doing justice to the intent of the opera, but the performances are so stellar, it really doesn't matter.    I've been anxiously awaiting the DVD and am very relieved that it's one of only two releases from last season's Met moviecasts.
0451204530|4.0|Great story and characters. And it is so well written that I forget I am reading. Ken Follett's writing in general has that quality...meaning, his words don't get in the way. I can get lost in these things. I loved it.
1881273377|5.0|This is a very good book! I would reccomend it to anyone who wants to learn how to Love. It is written for couples, but the concepts could be used in your normal day to day relationships. We are told to Love Others as Christ has loved us, if we observe what someones Love Language is and then speak to them in that language, they will be truely blessed, and so will we....Great Book!
B000NU2GU4|1.0|You're either getting paid to market HD DVD, or you just have no clue.<br /><br />Blu Ray is the better quality and everybody knows it.  And to say they the \\"sound quality is better,\\" is a complete joke.
B000ZOW96Y|3.0|This movie is good but not great. Sequels usually aren't as good as the first. The cast in this movie is outstanding. Al Pacino makes a good movie buy himself. I'd say the movie is good enough to rent. Although I bought it seeing how I bought the first and second one. It's hard not to buy a sequal if you already have the first in the series. I gave the movie a 3 star rating based on the fact that it's relayively the same as the first.
B00006LI4S|4.0|I must confess that Im 51 years old & have been listening to Pink Floyd since I was a teenager. I grew up with Pink Floyd music. Pre Gilmour days & post.     So, simply put, I am an enormous fan of David Gilmour. There are guitarist just as talented ( in their own way ) as Gilmour but Gilmour is my most favored guitarist due to his particular expression with his guitar.   For me, no one gives guitar like Dave gives guitar!     Having said that I have mixed feelings about this DVD. The music is great  & I love watching the band play some great tunes but it is mostly raw footage & looks more like a professional band practice they decided to record on camera.     A small part of the DVD is actual concert footage but the vast majority is what I guess is the AOL sessions, just the camera coming on, Gilmour & his band playing & singing a song & then the camera going off as they sort of just look at the floor.   Kinda weird & uncomfortable really.     Again, Its good music & fun ( sort of ) to watch but theres no flow to the experience. It isnt like watching a live concert as there is no audience ( for the AOL session, practice thing...) & the band must have been bored to tears as there is no real interaction between anyone. Just another day in the cubby hole.     Get it, enjoy it & once a year, just like the \\"Wizard of OZ\\" or \\"Its a Wonderful Life\\" pull it out & enjoy it again...
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I had up to this point not really liked any of the adaptations of Jane Eyre. It seemed like they were all too dark but this one is full of light and I liked Mr. Rochester. If you don't go by the book then you will love this version too! There a couple of inappropriate scenes in this movie that make it NOT for the family!

B00005JNJV|5.0|To begin, I'd like to thank Christopher Nolan and Warner Brothers for not only resurrecting the Dark Knight from the trash bin(thanks to Schumacher), but for giving this character a new fresh start.  As a fan of Frank Miller's Batman: Year One, this film has been the most rewarding installment that's truest to the source material.  I liked Tim Burton's films, disliked Schumacher's light hearted direction, but loved that Nolan did what was missing from all the previous films that made this film so special, and that was Batman's origin story.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a good story that's entertaining enough to leave you wanting more whether your a bat fan or not.  I look forward to future Batman films with Nolan as director and Bale as the caped crusader for they have proven that they take the character seriously.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|This HD disc format is made by Sony which used to be a great consumer electronics company but is now an evil money grabbing, greedy profit driven corporation with no care for its own customers. Despite weak PS3 sales Blu Ray is still doing well enough on its own because more studios support Blu Ray exclusively. I would love to see all studios supporting HD DVD and Blu Ray equally -- then consumers would have more choice in available titles regardless of format. Blu Ray's camp says its a success because there are more titles -- that doesn't mean consumers everywhere are clamoring for Blu Ray just yet. Not everyone is buying HD DVD either -- early adopters are getting screwed it is best to try and wait out the format war and when a winner emerges just buy that format.    Star Wars is a great movie trilogy and deserves the high definition treatment but it should not be crippled and locked down with outrageous DRM. I'm opposing any and all DRM from Microsoft in its Windows Vista operating system to Play for sure and Zune DRM and even DRM from Apple (even though I like the iPod), and DRM in Sony products. As a result of Sony's anti-consumer stance I refuse to buy Sony products now.     They used to have a great reputation and brand name but they threw it all away for greed and are bad in the ethics department.    Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment responsible for distributing the Star Wars movies and releasing them on VHS, DVD etc and soon Blu Ray or HD DVD wants the strictest DRM possible and insists on treating customers like criminals. They are acting just as bad as Sony --  problem is most music companies in RIAA and movie studio outfits in MPAA are like this in demanding DRM or copy protection technology they call Digital Rights Management but is really Digital Restrictions Management.    At least HD DVD supports Managed Copying by default -- while it still has DRM its less restrictive and easier to crack HD DVD's DRM but for some cracking won't be necessary since studios supporting HD DVD allow some copying.    I already own the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition on VHS -- I would really like it if they re-released this on DVD or on a Hi Def format with the video footage or commentary of how they improved the movie from original release to the Special Edition release. I also own the movies on DVD in Widescreen and Fullscreen and would like any case for Hi Def versions of these movies to also have Full Screen and Widescreen options instead of Widescreen only or Fullscreen only.
0142402753|5.0|We originally bought The Gruffalo by Julia Donaldson in London for our first child several years ago, and now own practically every book she has written.  Most of the stories have some sort of moral to them but not in your face or preachy.  They are fun and entertaining and even my husband and I do not mind reading them over and over again.
0061547832|3.0|This is the first Trump book I've read, so I can't compare it to his other works. I found the book motivational and would give it 4 stars if that were the only criteria. Unfortunately, the book is extremly short on substance. There's little if any actual gritty details about specific negotiations or deals. This is much less of a real estate instructional than a pep talk. On the negative side it seems to be at times nothing more than a forum for Trump to settle some old scores by dissing some people while paying some gratuitous compliments to others. It's also extremely repetitive. In conslusion, Trump is an infinitely better builder than he is a writer. Zanker's input is actually a bit better than Trump's, but again, that's not saying much. I learned very little from this book.
B000M4RGA6|5.0|I got this movie because my wife wanted to watch it and was not expecting a whole lot.  I have not cared for a lot of Will Ferrel's more recent movies but this one was very enjoyable.  Great movie to watch with the family, and looks great on Blu-Ray.
B00005JPHT|5.0|As a computer technician with a Masters degree who has been jumping on and off temp jobs for at least 5 years (everything in computers is temp contractual now) I have had health insurance perhaps 18 or 19 months out of that time.  The other times I couldn't afford it.  Try paying for food and shelter first in the 'down times', you'll find that takes priority.<br /><br />I'm only in my mid 30s, I had one problem begin with my knee during a time when I HAD coverage.  Torn meniscus and degenerative cartelege.  The tests alone cost an $1100.00 copay, which I'm still making installment payments on to this day.  And I didn't even have anything done, just had an MRI!  Still limping.<br /><br />I am amazed at how this movie is practically never mentioned in the media.  It seems as if it has disappeared overnight.  Finally got to see this movie yesterday night after waiting since it was released.  I just never saw any theatres showing it in my area.<br /><br />If things do not change, I fully expect that I and most people I know will finish out our lives bankrupt and destitute.  We all will get old and sick eventually, there is no escaping it- and then watch our savings and lives ruined.  It is painful and difficult.<br /><br />Making money off sick people in the healthScare system we have in the U.S. today is completely immoral, self-centered and godless.  It takes advantage of the weak, the disadvantaged, and the helpless in our society for profit.  Whether you accept that or not is immaterial, that's just how the system is today.  I cannot understand how those who call themselves 'Christians' can support politicians who are paid off to take advantage of people in this way.  Didn't Jesus say \\"care for the poor\\"?  \\"Love your neighbor?\\".  I see no love here.  Very depressing.  Don't get me started............
B000WGZGNS|5.0|Beyonce's performance was absolutely fabulous! She really shows her talent in this concert. Her vocals are on point and the dances are great! It's a great dvd to add to my collection!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I was six years old when I was introduced to ground breaking sound Of Eddie Van Halen's guitar. I begged my mother to purchase the album (were talking the late 70's early 80's here). She of course refused. What business does a six year old have owning a Van Halen record? However, this little deviant had another idea (though not such a good idea now that I think about it). I would purchase an older copy from a friend. I drumed up all my pennies to purchase this scratched and skiping version of Van Halen's first record. Erruption wouldn't play, Jaimies Cryin kept replaying \\"Oh, Oh, Oh, Jaimie's Cryin, Cryin, Cryin, Cryin.\\" Well you get the point. It just wasn't a great copy. My sweet mother also found it necessary to protect her little boy so there was no concerts until after age 12. By then David Lee Roth was a far memory. I did see the band with Sammy Hagar and I loved the show back in 1991 (Best I've seen to date). But tonight my friend Todd and I are going to go watch Van Halen with Dave himself in the band. This time, when they play I know the song won't go, \\"Jaimie's Cryin, cryin, cryin.\\"  All you kids under 20 probably don't know what an album is. You think I live in antiquity, but I have yet to find anything that has the warmth of vinyl on it's first couple of spins on the turn table. Back in the day vinly wasn't reserved for disc jockies. This first Van Halen album still is the birth of all modern guitar heroes. Buy it, put it in, and have respect for a guitar legend. As for me, I'm going to go jump in the shower tonight. I have a show to go to.
B00000DCHE|3.0|If you do get this album, get it for the fantastic rendition of Miami 2017, a freewheeling, rollicking rock suite with some of Joel's most aggressive lyrics ever.  There are good versions of Captain Jack and Billy the Kid- fun stuff, really, and a pretty though simple tune in \\"She's got a way\\".    Most else is well below the quality of songwriting that is Billy Joel's reputation.  Some of his worst stuff is on here, such as the mediocre melody \\"Streetlife Serenade,\\" though it is enhanced by some gutsy guitar work, as well as the faux-latin \\"Los Angelenos\\" done on a chintzy electronic piano at Toads Place in New Haven.  Even the hit \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\" is OK and fine, it's just well below his reputation for good song writing and melody making.
B00005JCAA|4.0|This movie is an interesting look into the problems of messing with death.  It also portrays the effects that love can have on us.  Love makes people blind.  But it also makes them selfless, when it is real love.  The characters (Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani)are realistic and appealing, and the emotions are raw and tangible.  I cried during this movie.  That means that I liked it.<br /><br />There is a very racy part in this movie, so I would not recommend it for anyone under the age of 34.  Great fun for the whole family minus the kids!!
0307387178|5.0|Whatever your views on the wisdom of McCandless' endeavor in Alaska, this book is a compelling and thought-provoking read that will not fail to touch you deeply.  I changed my mind about McCandless back and forth several times while reading his story, as I tried to get an idea in my head of who he was and what made him tick.  I read the book first and saw the film a week or so later.  I was VERY disappointed in the film -- if you really want to watch it, do yourself a favor and read the book first!  This is John Krakauer at his best. Fascinating.
B000OPOANE|5.0|First off, I am probably one of Rush's biggest fans & own every single album they ever made (with the exception of Archives, as it's no longer available) so it sort of pains me to say that while it's a solid effort, \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" will probably never rank as one of their classics. Although it features the usual high quality production values of a typical Rush album, with the exeption of \\"Far Cry\\", there really isn't anything here that jumps out at you the way a \\"Limelight\\", \\"new World Man\\" or \\"Anthem\\" would. Having said that, it's definitely a return to fine rockin' form for a band that did it's best to smooth out it's rough edges for most of it's career during the late 70s & 80s.  On this album, even more so than \\"Vapour Trails\\", Rush prove that you can add texture with nothing more than some well placed & tasty guitar licks.  On a technical note, the enhanced content on this MVI DVD is superb.  The 5.1 surround sound mix is execptional, as is the documentary of the making of the album. For a band that shunned videos for a long time, they certainly have been making up for it in the last five years with DVD after DVD and now this. I highly recommend this for any Rush fan, even the casual ones, because even though it may not be their best, it's retro-sounding enough to give you an idea of what the band used to do in their younger days. Buy it, you WON'T be disappointed.
B000HIVIOW|3.0|This dvd doesn't have David Bowie introducing The Snowman, like I remember. I'm sad. It's still a beautiful film though.
B000VWYNNW|4.0|WELL DEVOTED LED ZEPPELIN FANS, AS A JIMMY PAGE MANIA NUT SINCE 1969, I AM SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE REISSUE. DO NOT GET ME WRONG. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE THE BONUS TRACKS WHICH WE HAVE MISSED FROM THE MOVIE FOR OVER 20 YEARS. \\"SINCE I'VE BEEN LOVING YOU\\" IS GREAT.  THE VERSION IN THE REISSUE IS EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE IN THE MOVIE. FOR ME JIMMY PAGE IS UNBELIEVABLE.  EVERY NOTE HE HITS MOVES MY GUT.  DESPITE THE FACT THAT SOME FELLOW GUITARISTS SAY THAT HE IS SLOPPY. HE HAS AND WILL REMAIN MY FAVORITE LEAD GUITARIST OF ALL TIME. THE PROBLEM FOR ME IS THIS. \\"NO QUARTER\\" IS NOT THE VERSION FROM THE ORIGINAL DISK! IT IS LAME! JIMMY'S SOLO IS NO WHERE NEAR AS EXCITING AS IN THE ORIGINAL.  \\"WHOLE LOTTA LOVE\\" SEEMS TO BE EDITED OR CUT UP.  SO, WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN? IT MEANS THAT IF YOU LOVE LED ZEPPELIN, IT IS IMPERATIVE AND ESSENTIAL TO HAVE THE OLD SOUND TRACK VERSION AS WELL AS THE NEW VERSION. ESPECIALLY, BEFORE THE OLD VERSION IS OUT OF PRINT. LED ZEPPELIN RULES!
B000VR824S|5.0|Ok guys.  Unlike a lot of these reviewers, I wasn't there.  I didn't know anything about Jeff Beck and the Beatles \\"A Day In The Life\\".  But I do know that Cheryl Crow was probably there because she and Clapton had a thing going on a few years ago.  Other than that, this is a great DVD.     To me there are two performances worth the cost of admission.  The brief glimpse of Tal Wilkenfeld, Jeff Beck's bassist on \\"Cause We've Ended As Lovers\\" and Steve Winwood doing anything, but especially \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\" and with Clapton on \\"Had To Cry Today\\".    If you love to watch great guitarists doing what they do best, buy this DVD.  You won't be disappointed
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is an excellent set for HD DVD.  I did accidently bought the DVD version and exchanged it.  The HD DVD version far exceeds the DVD version.  I enjoyed it very much.
B000VAPZM2|3.0|It seems like I'm the only person on the face of this planet that's not a mega-huge fan of HSM. It's not that I hate \\"High School Musical\\", but I am starting to get a little sick of seeing it and hearing about it all over the place.     This sequel to the outrageously popular first movie isn't necessarily a bad sequel, but I don't think it's anything spectacular. It's got its strengths, and its weaknesses.     That little snob Sharpay is one of the major reasons I don't like this movie too great. I don't mind the actress Ashley Tisdale as a regular human being (in fact, I'm positive she's a very nice girl), but I do NOT like her character. It's like all her character cares about is her pretty little self. The whole world revolves around her, it's all about her, it doesn't matter if everyone else gets hurt or humiliated just so long as she gets what she wants, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. (Geez-Louise, Sharpay; get a life.)    There were some parts of the movie that I did like (such as the pool scene between Troy and Gabriella, and the scene where Troy makes up with his friends, and the scenes where Sharpay gets stood up), but overall, I'd give this movie a C, maybe a B-minus.
B00001QEE7|5.0|This is the first \\"princess\\" that our daughter was introduced for ... and she forever remains her favorite.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|It took me a couple times listening to it to really start to like it and before long I realized what a truly awesome CD this is.  I saw them play live a few weeks back and they played most of the songs on this CD.  What a show and CD.  Myles's voice is so much better then Scott's and he can play guitar pretty damn well too.  Mark is definitely a guitar god and he shows it throughout this CD.  The whole band is special.  These guys definitely Rock.  Get the CD.  You won't regret it.
0563486430|2.0|I have several issues with this novel:    --There was more focus on Rome than the Doctor and Rose    --The Doctor was wearing a toga. It may sound like something silly to get upset over, but the Doctor is always in his suit in Doctor Who and not having him in is suit, just made the story seem all that more unreal.    --Major issues supposedly had no solution, but the reader knows the TARDIS is the solution. The author doesn't even consider the TARDIS as a solution when it's obvious to us that the TARDIS can easily fix this problem    --There was a jump in the plot that was handled very poorly and thus came off as confusing and poor writing    --This novel is mediocre fan fiction, not up to par for a Doctor Who episode and just passing for an okay novel    --There were only one or two interesting action parts; however, the villain had potential that was never lived up to    --There was meant to be suspense through most of the novel, but I never felt it    --I don't want to give away the novel so I'll say it like this: Rose is alone with someone who they haven't figured out is a bad guy (even though it is pretty obvious that he is) and something bad is going to happen to Rose that she just figures out before/while it's happening. The reader figured out this plot point a few chapters ago    --The author greatly underestimates the reader's ability to figure out her plot    --The bottom line is that this novel wasn't that interesting, especially when you're expecting a Doctor Who quality episode piece of work    If you don't have very high standards for a Doctor Who novel and just want something to read, then by all means read this novel, but don't get your hopes up
141694737X|4.0|I bought this book about a month ago for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter.  She is really into animals and loves going to the zoo.  The book is very simple but cute.  After reading it to my daughter a few times she knows what things describe each animal.  She will see a picture of a frog somewhere and say \\"Frog too jumpy\\"  It is a great book to get young kids into reading.  She loves the flaps and the sentances are short so she will \\"read\\" it to me at bedtime.  All in all its a fav at our house
B000YABV90|5.0|I thought that this movie was great. I loved the story line and the fact that I was able to watch a movie without swearing in it. It is an excellent family movie and gives hope to those who believe that if you try hard enough and have a little faith and imagination you can do great things.  I can not wait until I see it again and can purchase a copy when it comes out.
B0008EI762|5.0|When I first listened to this album six years ago I did not like it. Perhaps I was disappointed because I had the sheer gaul to expect Prince to conform to my expectations for him as a musician. Perhaps I was not mature enough to receive the message of the album. Whatever the case, I decided to revisit this album a year ago. Now that I have matured, I can fully appreciate this album as a phenomenal body of work.     The musicianship on The Rainbow Children is unparalleled on today's in popular music landscape. It is a polished, complex mix of jazz, funk and soul tinged with splashes of rock. The lyrics are creative, thought provoking, introspective and inspirational. The Rainbow Children has some amazing songs including:    The sexy smooth jazz of \\"Muse 2 the Pharoah\\" and \\"Mellow\\"   The Curtis Mayfieldesque soulful rock of \\"Last December\\"   The uplifting contemporary gospel sound of \\"Everywhere\\"   The beautiful guitar-driven instrumental the \\"Sensual Everafter\\"  The funky bass-driven groove 1+1+1=3   The all out traditional jazz sound of the title track    For me the only weak spot is the awkward \\"Wedding Feast.\\" However, this song is so short that it doesn't lessen the impact of the album. This is probably one of Prince's best albums. It is unfortunate that it is so overlooked. I was wrong to judge this album so quickly on the first listen. It is a musical masterpiece that deserves a listen and a second chance by others, who like me, originally dismissed it.
B000HXE12S|5.0|The thematic element of this album did something for me that few other works of art have been able to do - synchronize the spiritual and rational of my mind around a unified concept, at least for the duration of the album.     My point is that this album speaks to me on many different levels, which to me illustrates the triumph and genius of the artists who created it. My suggestion is to listen to it on high-quality headphones to better pick up the underlying psychedelic subtleties of the music, which can be difficult to notice otherwise. Listen to it in sections of four, beginning with one of the \\"Prayer\\" tracks, putting time between each consecutive session.     This is not a particularly good album for easy listening, depending on what you look for in music. My impression is that the art, lyrics and sound were all created to be observed together to form the concept. Beneath the Black Metal is an alternative interpretation of the Judeao-Christian macrocosm that is equally fascinating and disturbing in what it implies.  Overall this album is part theosophy and part sonic experimentation.     If neither of those qualities interest you, you'll probably find this album obtuse and my review garbage.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|If you are a fan of this show then what are you waiting for?  Click \\"Add to Cart\\" and have it shipped to your door.  You won't be sorry.  The episodes were great to see again and the extras were additional insight into this amazing show (answering some of the questions I've had but had only heard rumors and speculation about).    If you aren't already a fan of this show but were a teenager at some point in your life or have a teenager in your life, I can't imagine how you wouldn't like this show.      I'm so glad I picked up this release and plan to watch it at least once a year.  The only thing that really makes me sad is that there are only 19 episodes before the show was canceled (probably by people that really didn't understand the show in the first place).  But the show went out on a high note and will enjoy a cult status for ever.    Enjoy
1559409010|5.0|Excellent movie made even better by Criterion. It is so damn funny that I have to pause the movie so my laughs can catch up.<br /><br />Now for the confession. I really identify with 'Blessed are the cheesemakers' skit because all through my childhood and adolescence I couldn't figure out the importance of an archaeological find in the middle east being, in my mind, \\"The Dead Sea Squirrels\\". It wasn't till I was in my early 20's when a Catholic co-worker looked horrified at me when I spoke of it and then set me straight. The Dead Sea Scrolls.
B000002QWD|5.0|Bing Crosby sang so beautifully he inspired other artists to emulate him; and this Christmas CD of Bing's greatest holiday hits is sure to put a smile on your face! The sound is excellent and the song selection is very good also.<br /><br />The album opens with Bing singing the classic \\"Silent Night.\\" His excellent diction bolsters his performance and the strings are just beautiful. Bing never sounded better even if there's some very slight surface noise. The backup choir enhances the natural beauty of the melody, too. Of course, Bing does a smashing job on \\"White Christmas;\\" this remains the best selling Christmas single of all time. \\"White Christmas\\" is not only beautiful but it also conjures up memories of holiday times years ago when life seemed simpler. \\"White Christmas\\" is a somewhat melancholy ballad that shall forever be one of the best Christmas ballads ever recorded.<br /><br />\\"I'll Be Home For Christmas (If Only In My Dreams)\\" is another lovely, somewhat melancholy ballad that Bing aces without a hitch. The guitar and strings enhance the musical arrangement; and I am sure that you will enjoy \\"I'll be Home For Christmas (If Only In My Dreams)\\" by Bing very, very much.<br /><br />\\"Jingle Bells\\" is obviously a much lighter, upbeat number that features The Andrews Sisters singing their best right along with Bing. The percussion and brass make a great arrangement; and The Andrews Sisters harmonize to perfection! If you like this number, listen also for \\"Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town\\" and \\"Mele Kalikimaka (Merry Christmas)\\" that also give us Bing singing well right along with The Andrews Sisters. I especially enjoyed \\"Mele Kalikimaka (Merry Christmas)!\\"<br /><br />\\"It's Beginning To Look Like Christmas\\" is another hit sung so well by Bing Crosby; and when Bing performs \\"Adeste Fideles\\" we get a more traditional number. Great!<br /><br />The liner notes are almost non-existent; we get a song list only. The artwork is very good, however.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys classic Christmas music and ballads. Bing Crosby fans will also love this album.stmas music and ballads. Bing Crosby fans will also love this album.
B00005JLT5|5.0|I just watched this movie for the 1st time! Wow, what a remarkable piece of film. This movie was gripping from the start. I thought Adrien Brody was amazing. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I have seen alot!
B00003CXDV|5.0|At first glance this movie didn't look like the type of movie I usually watch. I gave it a shot and boy was I happy I did. I think it is one of my favorite movies ever! It's belly rolling funny. I liked it so much I am buying here now!!    Hope you enjoy it too!
B000VAPZM2|5.0|I think that both of the movies are brilliant with brilliant singing dancing and acting.the choreography on both looks simple but is brilliant,the actors have very good voices and are so talented.    Chucky Kaplow is a very talented choreographer and he is young so we can tell he has obviously achieved alot to be working with such a prestigious director such as Kenny Ortega his work on Dirty Dancing,The writters of these two films is also very talented,the storlines are simple yet fun although im 19 i love and enjoy watching both films,i have lots of merchandise on both films.    once i watched both of them i was instantly hooked not just because of Zac or Corbin although they are a nice bonus every one on the film is great.i wish them all the best for there future careers.    review written by Davina Rabjohns aged 19
B000002696|5.0|I WISH THIS ALBUM WAS AVAILABLE 'NEW' FROM AMAZON!<br />UNFORTUNATELY I BOUGHT THIS FROM A STREET VENDOR IN SOHO & THE RECORD WAS SCRATCHED ON THE LAST 2 TUNES! I PURCHASED ANOTHER 'USED' COPY HERE WHICH IS IN BETTER SHAPE - I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT HERE FIRST!<br />Anyway, I really love it, and I am very happy with it. I especially love track 3, I play it every morning before work!
B00005JNTX|2.0|First off, I am a huge Frank Miller fan! Read the Sin City comics from the start. While I respect the great effort to remain faithful to the source material, I think this movie fails on many levels. Some of the acting is terrible, lines that might work in a comic book word balloon just come off stiff and goofy on screen. Michael Madsen's acting stands out the most! Was he underpaid?<br /><br />The Cast<br />Bad - Frodo as serial killer? Bruce Willis as a 60 year old cop? Jessica Alba, great body, no acting skills - see Fantastic Four, or entire career. Bleh. Wouldn't less famous actors have been a better choice?<br /><br />Good - Mickey Rourke as Marv. Roy Batty (I mean Rutger Hauer) actually works as a Cardinal. Rosario Dawson, perfect look for Gail. Brittany Murphy as Shellie, perfect! These are all based on look, acting is mediocre for the most part, I blame the script more than anything.<br /><br />The Look<br />The film is both faithful to the source material and beautiful, environments, clothing, rain all bathed in a world of impenetrable shadow and glowing light, work as they did on the comic book page. But the actors faces are lit with more definition, mid-tones, etc. which is weird. A world bathed in shadow should effect people too, right? When actors are not the primary focus on screen, the look is incredible. Other times, actors just seem pasted on top, very distracting.<br /><br />Most comic book movies are hurt by odd changes to the source material. Others by avoiding the big expensive special effects, no Galactus in Fantastic Four! Sin City suffers from the opposite.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie with the look of Sin City where the actors and environments mesh perfectly, check out Renaissance! The Sin City story is better, but visually, Renaissance works much better.<br /><br />Maybe Sin City 2 will be better, regardless of my disappointment, I will see the sequel.
1400032717|4.0|This author's style is precise, compact. The voice he's chosen to narrate the story works very well. This is not a tome in which to lose yourself over a Summer--the story grabs your attention and carries you along at a fast pace.
B00005JCAA|2.0|I recall a review from when the movie was released, stating that the director never passed up an opportunity to milk an emotion out of the actors.  Having finally seen the movie, I understand what he was saying.  Every shot it seems goes on for a third too long; every close-up is tight as the actors and actresses (fine cast by the way) run through their emotive ranges.  However, milking emotions will only get you so far.  At three hours it just got too tiring and boring.  If it had been tightened up to 120 minutes, everyone, from the movie's investors to its producers to the audience, would've appreciated it more.
B000NA2776|5.0|INTERNATIONAL \\"SHOW OFF-POP TART\\" (his own words) MIKA   has gifted the world \\"the greatest thing since sliced bread\\" in   the POP MUSIC ARENA with his CD album: \\"LIFE IN CARTOON MOTION.\\"    You will not find a better HOLIDAY music gift value.     ALL songs should be played \\"AT FULL THROTTLE\\"   (MIKA's own words.)     The only downside is blowing out your speakers 'cause   you love it all so much and so loud.    Just so you know--  -AMAZON chose to list \\"LIFE IN CARTOON MOTION\\"     #5 Best POP MUSIC for 2007.    -MIKA recently won FOUR awards--all in one evening--at the    WORLD MUSIC AWARDS in Monte Carlo for his song-writing/    singing/performing talents.

B000XPU5NY|5.0|In 2007, Genesis *finally* reunited for a tour, and it was so worth the wait. Although fans were hoping for a reunion of the \\"classic\\" line-up with original singer Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett (which *could* still happen at some point down the road---keep your fingers crossed!), Gabriel proved unavailable, which also cancelled out Hackett's invite, so the remaining trio---singer/drummer Phil Collins, keyboardist Tony Banks, and guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford---forged ahead without them, augmented by longtime touring sidemen Daryl Stuermer on guitar & Chester Thompson on drums. Of course I would've loved for Peter & Steve to have come to the party, but Phil, Mike & Tony (w/ Daryl & Chester) will do just fine! Seeing Genesis live on this tour, after a long 15-year wait, was one of the happiest nights of my life. The new live album, \\"Live Over Europe,\\" proves that Genesis, nearly four decades after they began, are still a musical force to be reckoned with. The band serve up a generous helping of songs from their impressive catalog of work, with songs as late as 1991 and going as far back as 1973. The band's musicianship, sound, and musical firepower remains undiminished (as are their stunning concert visuals---look out for the live DVD in 2008!). Every single song is a highlight in it's own right, but standouts for me include \\"Turn It On Again,\\" \\"Land Of Confusion,\\" a mindblowing \\"In The Cage\\" (including a searing keyboard solo from Banks), the rockin' \\"Home By The Sea/Second Home By The Sea,\\" the powerful \\"Firth Of Firth\\" (with a great guitar solo from Steurmer) and \\"I Know What I Like,\\" the always-mesmerizing \\"Mama,\\" the gorgeous \\"Ripples\\" (with beautiful acoustic guitar from Mike), the singalong \\"Throwing It All Away,\\" the dramatic \\"Domino,\\" the thunderous \\"Los Endos,\\" the contagious fun of \\"I Can't Dance,\\" and the lovely finale, \\"Carpet Crawlers.\\" And I must make special mention of Phil & Chester's drum duet, which they have dubbed \\"Conversations With 2 Stools.\\" There are drum duets, and then there are *drum duets*. This is one of the latter, with Phil & Chester going head-to-head in perfect synchronicity, first on 2 stools, before easily seguing onto their respective drumkits. You have never heard drum interplay like this before, believe me! It's stunning. But then again, so is the whole album---\\"Live Over Europe\\" is an awesome live set from Genesis. The passing of time has taken nothing away from their musical prowess & skill, or the magic of their music. Phil, Mike, Tony, Daryl & Chester...take a bow, gentlemen! And thank you for turning it on again one more time.
B000VBJEEG|2.0|This film has paper thin stereotyped characters that move slowly and painfully through an adult themed plot.  My children of 4 and 6 walked out of the theatre because it was so boring.  There are no surprises as you can pretty much guess what is going to happen next.  While they may have been attempting the ultimate fish out of water story the simple fact that rats in your kitchen is a disgusting concept.  There are a lot of better films for your children.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|I bought this CD when it was first released, and I was so blown away by it I had planned to immediately write a glowing review.  Well, here it is December, and I'm just now getting around to writing a review.  Looking through all the other 5 star reviews, I see that praise for this CD has been very well expressed, so let me just say the following.  I ordered this CD from Amazon, and when I picked it up from the post office I immediately put it into the CD player to check out on the drive home.  Song after song was so jaw droppingly good though, that I never made it home.  Instead I just headed out into the hills to keep listening to the CD.  It was that good.  And with 17 tracks, this is a fairly long CD,  but not once did I grow tired of the CD and want to turn around.  That was back in March, and I still listen to this CD all the time.  It is a real treat as so many others have expressed so well.  Very highly recommended.
0099481685|1.0|i'm shocked that so many people enjoyed this book.  I found it poorly written, predictable and redundent.  If you are considering reading this book spend some time reading the people who gave it only one star. They seem to have a clear handle on why it's not worth your time reading this book.
140120306X|4.0|This is the third released [[ASIN:1563898586 The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]] graphic novel by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill.  Unlike the first two volumes, which were originally released as comic book mini-series, this is a self-contained graphic novel.  The story takes place in the England of 1958, where the ageless Mina Murray and Allan Quatermain steal \\"The Black Dossier\\", which is a file containing documents relating to the various permutations of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  The contents of The Black Dossier are printed in this book, interrupted periodically by comics portraying what Mina and Allan are up to (or is it the other way around?).  The contents of the Dossier are in various formats; including comics, book excerpts, plays and many others.  This material is very well produced, but it is difficult at times, particularly when it references some obscure characters the reader may not be familiar with.  This book is a remarkable achievement, but it is considerably less enjoyable than the previous League graphic novels.

074356619X|5.0|I own this CD set for more than 6 months now. It's playing in my CD player in my car 85% of my driving time in my car. Sometimes I hear only bits and pieces and sometimes I am fully tuned, the most important thing for me is that the knowledge of the secret will be with me everywhere I go.   I absolutely love this CD set, it's priceless! Rhonda really explains into details (with good examples too) everything that it is spoken about in the DVD.  This Christmas I am giving this set to everyone on my Christmas list, as I said- it's Priceless!    After the first time I watched the DVD (a long while before I owned the CD set), I liked it a lot but I was also a little upset and mad, I felt so miserable with myself refusing to accept we have 100% control over our lives. I felt so pity for all the bad things I supposedly attracted to my life and told my husband (who purchased the DVD) that I don't like it and it`s not fair. I insisted that some things are written for us- as we call it destiny.    I watched the DVD over and over again trying to understand it better, it was playing in my house everyday, I listened to it playing in the background. Few friends recommended me the CD set. I was thrilled and ordered it right away.   I know I am growing spiritually with it. After hearing it so many times I notice new things all the time and I am able to understand things in much deeper way after using the secret everyday in my life, or by thinking about my day and why things went wrong or well.    This is a true life transformation, I love the fact I can play it while driving, what can be easier than that? Most people spend time in their car daily, so instead of listening to music they can listen to what is going to change their lives!    The secret is the most important basic to our existence. I bet only people that are frustrated with their lives (like I was at one point) will say anything bad about  it. Listen to it not with your ears but with your soul and you will be able to understand and know  how the Low of Attraction  plays full part in your life.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I picked up this CD in Barnes & Noble tonight, out of sheer curiosity... who is this woman who seems to be such a trainwreck?  I had only seen her in the gossip rag sheets.      I was stunned... incredible voice, songs, arrangements.  Best album I've heard in a long time.  Gets you right in your chest.
0525950079|5.0|I missed \\"Pillars of The Earth\\" the first time around but lucky for me, I discovered it recently. One of the most unique, interesting and compelling books I've ever read. When I found there was a second book, I didn't dare hope it would be as good. but happily - it's BETTER! You don't need to have read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" to enjoy this but you won't want either book to end so do yourself a favor and read them both.
B000VECAEO|5.0|A fitting end to a tremendous series.  This kind of comic genius comes once in a lifetime.  Will cherish it like a fine wine or maybe a hennigan scotch.
B000PMGS8G|4.0|This DVD may be a good present for all people who likes this movie, or science fantastic, or comixes, or for Queen fans.  But for collectors who previously bought this movie in different editions may be not satisfied about bonuses. 2 interviews, one of it with the artist who painted a cover for this DVD, 1936 serial episode, 1 art work - and it's all? Some customers who wrote review before me said the same - why collectors edition was reliased with so poor bonuses? British Silver Anniversary edition and French collectors edition is much better.   And also what is strange for me - the most part of the success of this version of Flash Gordon adventures was because the sountrack of Queen. Many Queen fans bought this film only for it. Why nobody can place some bonuses with Queen - interviews, Flash promo videos, studio works? Very strange marketing politic
0618680004|5.0|The fact that Dr. Dawkins is a genius is nothing new.  This book is a black and white book; there is nothing gray about it.  You will either love it or hate it.  It all depends and your religious upbringing and your level of scientific education.  If you have been raised and educated as a free thinker, a skeptic, and someone who believes in evidence rather than simple faith and heresy, this is the book for you.  If you believe in fairy tales, miracles, and that the world is created 6000 years ago; men and women are the descendants of Adam and Eve, don't bother reading it.  This book is way above your intellectual platform.  You would look at Grand Canyon and see God rather than geological evolution at its best.
B000RJO578|5.0|Honestly, this movie struck me less as a comedy and more as simply a good movie. It is funny (with a lot of that subtle British humor that we all love) but what I really loved about it was the character development, the attention to detail, and a plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat but can also be the source of a deep after-movie discussion (if you do that sort of thing...)      Pegg was absolutely wonderful in portraying his character and, of course, complements what's his face very well.  The story is written very cleverly, it actually has a couple points to make, and is down-to-earth entertaining. A couple images are not suitable for children or people who are eating food that doesn't sit well anyways.      Again, try to avoid thinking of this as a comedy (because that's not exactly what it is) and enjoy the show!
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Cool movie, i was in doubt when i bought. But Tarantino know how to make movies.
B00004RFFI|5.0|A very good disaster movie. Gives the viewer an idea of what it would be like to be caught in a tornado. Seems like reality while watching from comfort of your home. Paxton and Hunt both give excellent performances.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|A man named George Bailey (a superb James Stewart) lives in a small town called Bedford Falls. He contemplates happy times and travelling with his love Mary (Donna Reed). But on Chrsitmas Eve, because of intense frustration and an impending scandal - he conemplates suicide. He is visited by an angel named Clarence (a lovely performance by Henry Travers) who shows him what the world will be like if he had never been born. It is at this point that the film becomes very dark (especially given what has gone before), yet the underlying message is simple and uplifting - \\"no one is a failure who has friends\\". George Bailey was a completely selfless man, who thought himself a failure, and yet didn't realise he was so loved by his friends and neighbours.<br /><br />Now I'm not used to seeing older US films like this but its' still a lovely film, maybe even inspiring Simpsons jokes (some plot elements are taken off in the episode \\"When Flanders Failed\\", and the horrible rich businessman Henry Potter played by Lionel Barrymore, is like Mr. Burns in a way). Some ideas may be taken from A Chrsitmas Carol as well.<br /><br />Throughout the film George is such a nice, honest, friendly guy, who will help all his friends out. This is shown in the scene where he gives his honeymoon money away to help them until the bank opens. Its' a very close knit community where everyone knows everyone else.<br /><br />Yet, the last part in which we see Bedford Falls is now called \\"Pottersvile\\" after the Scrooge-like Mr. Potter is genuinely disturbing and shows Bailey's descent into sadness, anger and despair when no-one, not even his mother, knows him.<br />Everything is different and the whole town has a \\"bad\\" air.<br /><br />But it is overall a  beautiful film that is so warm and touching, and made me feel happy and sad all at once - an American classic.
B00001QEE8|5.0|Excellent movie for young children and adults as well. My grandson (2 yrs) has watched it enough to sing the songs in it. Very good movie. Buy it. Watch it over and over.
B000P2A256|4.0|It's been a long time coming for Adam Levine and the rest of Maroon 5. Their debut album, Songs About Jane, was released back in 2002, yet it really didn't start getting major rotation until 2004, and their biggest hit from that album, \\"This Love\\", didn't even win a Grammy until 2005. What's more, original drummer Ryan Dusick left the band due to exhaustion. But present drummer Matt Flynn helps the rest of the band solidify things on their sophomore effort.<br /><br />Though I'm not sure what It Won't Be Soon Before Long is supposed to mean, this is still an excellent album. ALL the songs aren't as soul-induced this time around, but they still sound great. But first I'd like to state that this is another case in which I wonder what version of the album I have because I have a thirteenth track called \\"Stay\\", which is pretty darn good. Also good are sensual songs like \\"Kiwi\\" and one song I still cannot get enough of, \\"Makes Me Wonder\\".<br /><br />If \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" sounds familiar, it's because Adam used some of those lyrics in Kanye West's \\"Heard 'Em Say\\". But it's still a great song, as are \\"Back at Your Door\\", \\"Wake Up Call\\" (the video is pretty corny, though) and \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\". In fact, there are only two missteps. \\"Little of Your Time\\" feels like it took only a little time to write; and as for \\"Can't Stop\\", note to Adam: when a MAN talks about touching himself, it's a little disturbing.<br /><br />Songs About Jane is a very hard album to top, but It Won't Be Soon Before Long keeps things moving in the right direction. Pick it up if you haven't already.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Wonderful, sensitive guitar playing that leads the mind down memory lane and beyond.  JM has definitely 'grown' enough to create this latest CD, and one can hear it in his music.

0143038583|4.0|When a book is both well-written and informative on a topic that is as central to our lives as what and how we eat, it deserves our attention. Pollan describes his search for the origins of his four meals, journeying to the cornfields and feedlots of the mid-West to track down the mysterious constituents of fast-food, to large- and small-scale organic farms, and to the woods of Sonoma to hunt boar and mushrooms.    But more than simply journalistic research, this book is a meditation on man's relationship with nature, on the anthropological origins of our current attitudes to eating, and on the morality of eating meat. Neither polemical nor religious, it is nevertheless both a spiritual book and an angry one. Pollan is never shrill, but does not hide his distaste for industrial farming, and what he has found out about what it does to us and the Earth.    Unfortunately this highlights the book's main weakness: Pollan accepts that his sustainable meals - from Polyface farm, and from his stint as a modern hunter-gatherer - are anomalous in that they are not options that are available to feed most of the people most of the time. He gives little more than a nod to the fact that the Earth's ability to sustain many more humans than it did when Dr Malthus first predicted our demise is largely thanks to modern fertilizers and other 'industrial' advances. He identifies the problems that this has caused but is weak on solutions - though he does identify the government policy that subsidizes corn and soybeans at the expense of other crops as the culprit in making processed, obesity-causing foods cheaper than natural food.    In summary this is an educational, thought-provoking and essential book for anyone who cares what they eat.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I've been a Floyd fan since the early 70's, but not hardcore in any way. I liked Dark Side and a few major cuts from other albums, but I never went out of my way to own their vinyl... but NOW, I am truly impressed. Gilmour has created an incredibly beautiful double DVD set... with amazing tracks that yearn to be heard. The production of this DVD set was first rate, thoughtful and consice, masterful in strength and savory in number. Songs from the past sound 10x better than their originals without any loss of rhythm or tempo. This is a fantastic, complete and well orchestrated concert. Bravo and hats off to you and your crew DG!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This movie was awesome!!!! If your a love buff like myself&just really get into those movies that touch your heart yet add alittle comedy just at the right moments then this movie is for you!

B0001JXQEM|5.0|If you are a Weezer fan and/or a Blue Album fan, than this is a must have.  The first disc is classic but it's the second disc that makes this worthwhile.  The second disc is awesome.  The music is right in line with the rest of the style of the first disc and rocks.
0446577391|5.0|Few sequels are as good as the original work. One that immediately comes to mind is [[ASIN:B0007YXRF4 The Godfather: Part II]], a script dominated by revenge.    [[ASIN:B000WO0S8S The Collectors]], which introduced the Camel Club members to Annabelle Conroy  and Jerry Bagger, was tremendously exciting. Stone Cold tells not just the tale of Jerry Bagger's search  for Annabelle and his revenge but  Oliver's own score-settling. And others have reason to seek revenge. We meet Harry Finn, whose quest for justice, takes him to dark places. Watching Finn at work is reminiscent of the brutal wisdom of Don Ciccio who who explained to a mother grieving over the death of a husband and one child why her youngest child must also die:\\"When he is a man he'll come for revenge.\\"    This dish of revenge is immensely satisfying.  Bon appetit!
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I was in junior high when My So Called Life originally aired, I think I caught a couple episodes when it aired, but sadly, for me it got my attention later on in reruns, thanks to cable.  Now,13 years later after purchasing the series thanks to the miracle of tv on dvd, I realize what a great show it was, if only I had latched on when it originally ran.  This show is universal, with themes everyone can relate to, with characters that you truly grow to care about.  For those of you who din't really get to watch it, when it aired, don't doubt in buying this series either for yourself or as a gift.  Its totally worth it.  Not to mention, the price is excellent as some of the die hard fans will tell you.  When the first boxed set of the series came out, I think it was about $80, so at this price get 2!  You won't be sorry, it has a cult following for a reason.  Now, if they'd only make a movie to tie up loose ends, (well, one can dream).
B00005JPS5|5.0|We took our kids to see this movie and they all loved it. I liked it because they didn't include sexual innuendos like the Shrek movies I've seen. That always makes me angry that this type (sexual innuendos) of writing has to be included in what is supposed to be a children's movie. Anyway, this movie is great for small children as well as bigger kids. The jokes are funny, and my kids thoroughly enjoyed it. Although at one point it seemed rather weird that a bee can sue humans, it all fell into place in the end. We all have to realize that this is animation, not real life, so no real life acting should be portrayed. They all did a wonderful jobs doing their parts, especially Jerry Seinfeld. Well done! I will be buying this when it comes out.
B000VZGK3K|5.0|The blu-ray transfer of this instant classic is superb, probably one of the best looking transfers to high definition of this MUST own Martin Scorcese epic.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Watched it on my 70 inch Sony Qualia ,player was Toshiba XA-2.  I was Blu-ray only until I heard about this set.I must say that I  had seen every episode atleast 20 times ( I know,I need to get a life),but watching it on HD-DVD on a 70 inch screen was jaw dropping.Every hair follicle,skin blemish,background set imperfection ,bead of sweat,and makeup powder was evident.Vivid colors,60's style jumped off the screen.Soft focus  was purposly used on the hot chicks to make them look better,otherwise MOST shots were razor sharp.There was  texture and stiching in the uniforms that I had never seen before.Yes,the packaging kinda sucks,but you'll forget about that as soon as you pop in your first hd-dvd.
0767827791|5.0|The movie rates 5 stars; this DVD rates 3.<br /><br />Picnic is a movie I didn't merely watch; I experienced it from age 6 forward.  At Waikiki Beach, restaurant jukeboxes on beach-directed speakers played \\"Moonglow\\" incessantly on summer afternoons.  That sweet music was ingrained in my psyche.  Older cousins told me Picnic was about the best date movie ever made.<br /><br />Flash forward to 1962, when Picnic was late-night movie fare on TV.  I finally saw the fabled movie.  Kim Novak was even more radiant than anticipated.<br /><br />That pretty-in-pink moment at Neewollah is a seminal moment of movie history - what a vision of feminine pulchritude.<br /><br />Casting of other characters was near-flawless.  OK, Bill Holden was a bit too old to play a twenty-something college dropout, but he turned in a compelling performance as the tortured dreamer, Hal.  Cliff Robertson played the precise balance of a reluctantly tolerant college buddy versus rightfully scornful moralist of man-child, Hal, who had destroyed his dream of a future with Madge. Bill Holden, Betty Field, Verna Felton, Arthur O'Connor, Roz Russell, and an exceptional Susan Strassberg are gone now, but in Picnic, they live on forever.<br /><br />Susan Strassberg is the campus queen's kid sister you wish you met in high school.  Millie is a misfit, big city girl stuck in a small town.  Verna Felton is the neighbor you wish you had living on your block.  Rosalind Russell fears her biological clock is in its final throes, seeing hapless, happy-go-lucky Arthur O'Connell as her final chance at companionship.<br /><br />There is plenty of charm in the depiction of small-town Mid-America, and you can't believe that the tortured conflicts of the characters could possibly take place there.<br /><br />The closing scene has Madge (Novak) on a bus, ostensibly to rendezvous with Hal, who has hopped a freight train.  The highway parallels the train tracks, and the bus slowly pulls behind a speeding train.  Most viewers would assume a happy ending.<br /><br />However, do Madge and Hal find happiness?  Betty Field, the mother, married a ne'er-do-well like Hal, and she has felt the pain of abandonment.  She is left with high-schooler, Millie, a devious handful.  Finally, does Arthur O'Connell commit to Rosalind Russell?<br /><br />These are some points to ponder as the credits roll.  Keep your fingers crossed that a \\"proper\\" DVD finally gets pressed, one that respects widescreen movies.  I had to catch Picnic at a film festival for the theatrical widescreen version.  Don't miss it.<br /><br />Strains of Moonglow are playing on my computer as I write this review.  It will probably be played at my funeral.  It's truly amazing how some things stick in a six-year old's mind.Hal find happiness?  Betty Field, the mother, married a ne'er-do-well like Hal, and she has felt the pain of abandonment.

B00005YXZH|5.0|This easily one of my four or five favorite albums of all time. I got into Wilco through \\"Summerteeth\\", but this was the second Wilco album I heard and as soon as I listened to it the whole way through I knew it was an absolute masterpiece. This is one of the best cases I can think of (along with OK Computer and Loveless, just 2 off the top of my head) where the production matches absolutely perfectly with the lyrics. I think this album and Summerteeth have Jeff's best lyrics. Their best album methinks.
B00000IQW5|5.0|One of my favorite movies, mostly because of the message of the movie which I think if spread more prevalently around would make this a better world to live in: Thinking of others not only helps THEM but in the end Saves Yourself too...<br /><br />Love the flying too, but that could just be cause I'm a pilot that loves adventure maybe just a little more than the average fella. :)
B000UYX4OK|4.0|Although not a mega-budgeted film, this is a very authentic looking rendition of the legend with a very good 2.35 High Definition transfer to Blu-ray.
B000063DHL|5.0|Think of any power metal band from the late '80s onward. There's a good chance they were influenced by Iron Maiden's \\"Somewhere in Time\\" album. Need proof? Take a listen to the long, progressive songs that take on a futuristic, epic feel to them. The synth-styled guitar and bass work alongside the adventurous lyrics. Even the artwork through this entire album presents music that is both beautiful and influential.   All right, so influence isn't the only thing that makes an album great. However, I think that \\"Somewhere in Time\\" is, regardless of how influential it is, remains one of the best heavy metal albums of all time. From the larger-than-life opener of \\"Caught Somewhere In Time\\", we are taken to a futuristic world in the style of Iron Maiden. Where powerful drumwork and amazing guitar and bass melodies compliment ingenious and adventurous lyrics. Take the effects-driven lead guitar riff, wondrous guitar solo and sing-a-long chorus of \\"Wasted Years\\". Even \\"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\\" takes a topic like running and makes it seem so much more bold and majestic.   Some people may say that adding this tone to classic Iron Maiden may have been a slight mistake on the band's part. This was ironically released in the same year as Judas Priest's \\"Turbo\\", which had very similar, futuristic-sounding elements to it. Even though this album is generally remembered as being much better, I happen to like both albums.   What you have to remember is to keep an open mind. Don't you think if a band released the same album over and over it would get tiring? Admittedly, \\"Alexander The Great\\" runs up a bit short in comparison to the absolute epic of Iron Maiden's \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\", but that's all right, because the rest of the album is great all the same.   Other strong points include \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" which features a great, opening bassline and another catchy chorus. A personal favorite is \\"Deja Vu\\", which seems to be enormously influential inthe power metal genre. The driving energy behind the drums, the spacey wah-wah riffing of the guitars, and Bruce's untouchable wailing of \\"Feel like I've been here before!\\". And it all ends up being classic Maiden with a new twist to it.   So, some people may have mixed feelings about this album. Me? I think it adds an exciting, new element to an already awesome band. This is personally an album I hold in high regards. In my opinion, if you want more great Iron Maiden and have an open mind, this is something I hope you're really gonna love. After all, Maiden's already known for their incredible musicianship and professional songwriting, what's wrong with taking a little trip through time? Speaking of which, thanks for the time, and peace.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I can't handle history in black and white dates. But give me history with faces, sights, sounds and smells and I'm hooked. Add sacrifice, heroic acts and strong convictions and you have Amazing Grace and my heart.<br /><br />This movie blew my expectations out of the water. I expected good enough because so many have given it great reviews. I didn't expect to laugh. I didn't expect to care so much about the characters. I expected to struggle a little with boredom during parliamentary discussions but even those grabbed hold of me.<br /><br />The Christian theme is present but not overdone. God was part of the picture-- a driving force -- since He loves all people and all people are created in His image. And on the flip side the words arse, bloody and hell are tossed about throughout the well-written dialogue.<br /><br />If you are a history fan you really should at least rent it. Fans of movies like Luther, Master and Commander, Girl with a Pearl Earring etc. will probably like Amazing Grace. It's not ram-packed action and has plenty of heavy dialogue so thinkers should get much out of it. I would caution parents to watch the movie first before letting younger children see it as there are some disturbing images.
0439954630|5.0|IF you can handle challenging moral, theological and metaphysical ideas, told through spectacularly imaginative and well-realized realities, and from the viewpoints of flawed and incredibly human characters, then this is the series for you.<br /><br />If the very idea that God might not exist, and even stranger might exist but might not be an all-powerful being, disturbs you too much, then of course you might not enjoy this book.<br /><br />I personally believe in God, and in a great being that wishes us benevolence; I think he's set up the conditions where we are up to building it ourselves. I was not offended by this book in the slightest, for whatever that's worth.<br /><br />So, to sum up: a great tale, well told; and disturbing to some because it is so well told, and they feel threatened in their own beliefs.

B000M53GM2|4.0|Six years after Licence to Kill, Bond makes a return to the big screen with a new actor playing the role - Pierce Brosnan - along with a decent budget to produce \\"Goldeneye\\", one of the better modern Bond films that has a complete and sturdy feel just like the originals with Sean Connery.  Brosnan is no Connery, though, in fact he feels like an evrage Bond to me.  Every Bond actor before him had something recognizable, like Moore's humor or Dalton's toughness.  Brosnan didn't seem to have anything unique about his character, except that his does a little bit of everything, which is still a good thing.  Its the solid story and list of characters that give Goldeneye a good rating, along with some very memorable action scenes.<br /><br />The movie begins on a good note.  A breathtaking scene of a dam more than 600ft. high features Bond bungee-jumping off to the bottom.  The camera catches a true sense of the massive proportions of the dam, as well as the fall.  If that weren't enough, before credits start rolling, Bond escapes the scene of action by jumping off a mountain without a parachute, leaping into a falling unmaned plane, and steering clear of mountains just in time.  Then the music begins, \\"Goldeneye\\", a very modern feel Bond tune - with a beat - performed by Tina Turner.<br /><br />The story is actually nothing original here.  Yet again, Russia is involved with the plot of a Bond film.  The Cold War has ended, however, so things are a little different.  A group of villains led by a man named Alec (Sean Bean) steals something known as \\"Goldeneye\\" which can control various satellites that can be used to target a city and destroy it.  Its basically all about getting rich or innocent people will die.  There are many more people involved, some more villainous than others.  It was almost a bit confusing to keep up with, but I thought it kept things interesting.  Sean Bean makes a great villain in this film, and a Bond movie first - is actually an ex double-O himself.<br /><br />The action felt limited, but when it came it struck hard.  The tank chase in the streest of St. Petersburg, Russia was the highlight, along with an excellent final fight between Alec and Bond - hanging in air from a massive satellite antenna.  There were lots of explosions in this film too, and probably more than any other Bond fillm to this point.<br /><br />The Bond girls were two of the best I thought, although one was actually more of a villain.  With an already strange name of \\"Xenia Onatopp\\", thats basically what she does.  An interesting character and decent actor, but probably just as crazy as say \\"May Day\\" from the View To A Kill movie.  Only, this one gets off - literally - by shooting and strangling her victims.  Yes, she freaky.  The other girl becomes Bond's love interest, and actually has a decent character and use throughout the film.<br /><br />Limited action, an unoriginal story and, well, Pierce Brosnan keep this from being the perfect Bond - but its not far behind.  Brosnan does the job well, and though the story is unoriginal, it was told very nicely and tightly - kinda like the very first Bond films.  Action is good, but only comes occasionaly.  The charcaters are one of the best things about this film.

0060989157|5.0|Yes, this book was you typical sex,drugs, and rock and roll story but it also included a lot of unexpected \\"depth\\" that made it a wonderful read.  The chapters on Vince Neil's daughter's death literally left me in tears.  It made me realize that all of the guys were real people even if they did seem to be indestructable.  I am still amazed, not to mention glad, they all made it through the 80's alive.  I also loved how they all seemed to live the life, with the exception of Mick Mars on most ocassions, to the fullest and didn't apologize for anything.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to spend a couple of days reading, because once you start the book you will not be able to put it down!
1592332803|5.0|The joy of vegan baking is a perfect baking book.  How I wish it had been out when I first became vegan and was left sorting through some good, and mostly terrible recipes for baked goods.  I love how this book is broken apart and includes savory as well as sweet breads.  The biscuits are the best vegan biscuits ever (I have tried 5 other recipes that don't even come close to these).  My omni family enjoyed the chocolate almond brittle and apple crumble at Thanksgiving.  Everything I have tried has been a success.  As other reviewers have mentioned this book is beautiful.  A great gift for anyone interested in baking (vegan or not).

I took a chance and ordered it and this show has become our all-time favorite family series.  What a sleeper!!! This was one of the best shows I have ever seen and am extremely disappointed that there is no 2nd season available for purchase.  What's going on????  Let's all get together and press for subsequent seasons to be produced ASAP!
B000EHSVS2|5.0|War certainly does not take a holiday vacation. It is well to remember that one of the key battles of World War 2 (The Bulge) came during pre Christmas, 1944. It could easily have been George Patton's finest hour. This strange, enigmatic leader set two goals for himself-total victory and total self aggrandizement.Brilliantly portrayed by George C. Scott (who refused the Oscar), Patton seemed from the outset to do things his way, as he had in overcoming dyslexia. He came from a moneyed California family and was most certainly not accustomed to being told what to do. His learning in tank warfare helped revolutionize the corps itself. When war came, Patton was certainly ready for it. But is warfare really ever ready for the George Pattons of the world? Indeed, the Nazis respected him more than many Americans. This reviewer certainly cannot see Patton succeeding under President Truman, nor any other Europeaan chieftain except Eisenhower.In any event, \\"Patton\\" is certainly filmaking at its best, even if the subject matter may not be.
B000VDDDY6|3.0|i bought this set from our local big box warehouse after buying a Toshiba HD-D3 player on sale. the HD picture is absolutely stunning and I was completely tickled looking at the new CGI scenes. but the first disc started to freeze and jerk during Where No Man Has Gone Before. I cleaned the disc with a CD cloth and cleaner and the disc finally played fine. then I tried disc two. The first epidose, Naked Time, froze nine minutes into the episode, during the cafeteria scene. I wiped the disc with a CD cloth and cleaner but to no avail. the disc froze even worse than before and I had to reboot the player. i did research on the web and found that these hybrid HD-DVD/DVD combo discs have been notorious for problems with the HD side. I finally gave up on the set and returned it to the big box warehouse. I should say that the DVD side on both discs played perfectly. I also have not found any reviews on digital review web sites that have mentioned a problem with this Star Trek set, so maybe it's an isolated problem. still, i have not decided whether or not to try another copy of this set. i must repeat, the high definition side of the disc looks incredible on my 55' LCD widescreen TV but I wish Paramount had released the remastered Star Trek on single sided HD-DVD discs (of which I have not had a problem with my other HD-DVD movies).
B0007OASII|5.0|Wow - this was my first Kamelot CD, and it really blew me away.  Pushing 50, hearing a new twist on metal that I can really enjoy (since it is beyond my supposed demographics - and mind you, Slayer and Metallica are in my playlist) is always a challenge.  You hear a riff or sound here and there and say 'Dio', 'Sabbath', 'Queensryche', 'Rush', etc etc.  Is there any original metal these days? Well, I found some right here on this CD (as well as Dream Theater and Symphony X).    What really sets this apart from a lot of other metal out there is the lack of darkness, double-pedalling and all the songs relying on the 'riff'.  Mind you, I love a great riff, but it is just part of it all. Kamelot really pulled together all the classic metal elements into superb, thematic, melodic masterpiece.  It took me at least 3 spins to get into it because I was expecting the current prog metal 'standard' of heavy, complicated riffs.  After spin #3, this CD just sunk into my head...boy if I was in a metal band these days, what more of a reaction like that could you want from your fans?    Give these guys a try - you will not be disappointed!! For those Kamelot fans, judging from what I've read, this one is truly a peak in their career.
140120306X|4.0|After waiting over a year for the book to be published, I would have to say that it was indeed worth it simply from the sheer amount of detail and research that went into the volume.  From a production standpoint, this is by far one of the most complex graphic novels that I have ever read, with different types of paper being used for several sections, an impressive 3-D spread (with glasses!), and Moore's use of various prose styles (for instance, writing in the style of P.G. Wodehouse and the Ingsoc of 1984).  It is a truly beautiful book that you will be proud to have in your collection.  For a negative, however, it must be said that this is probably one of the most sexually explicit comics that Moore has ever written, and should definitely be kept out of the reach of children.  The story is also not much to speak of, but this was never meant to be the third volume of the series and instead serves to fill in holes that the first two volumes left behind.  Still, it does entertain, and it is fun to try and place all of the references to other works that you will find within.  In all, you will have a lot of fun with this book, and I would recommend it to any comics lover.  I can't wait for volume three!    P.S.  I learned that the strange \\"black balloonist\\" within the book is from a series of dolls called the \\"Golliwogs\\", which were based on 19th century minstrel show characters.  Very odd.
B000YHE4AG|4.0|Overall this is not a 5 star movie but even adults will laugh out loud at several scenes in this movie.  One of the better scenes is the snow ball fight.  Elf, who is human, has develope some super powers grwing up on the North Pole.  He is also quite addicted to sugar.  Another favorite scene is the spaghetti meal he prepares for the family.  It includes the longest movie belch that is so long that it becomes ridiculous.
0143038419|1.0|It was painful to read this book (book group reading, otherwise I wouldn't ever have picked it up.) The author endlessly and tediously refers to her divorce, her depression, her loneliness, her divorce, her depression, her loneliness, her divorce... get the idea? Her \\"humor\\" was a source of much eye-rolling, and I found her writing to be shallow. The subtitle of the book is \\"one woman's search for everything...\\" I found her searching for nothing, but rather dwelling on the past, and not moving forward.
0375847227|1.0|When my children were younger, I would pre-read books before giving them.  I was entranced by the golden compass - and then I read the next book and was horrified.  These books are not for children!  I don't mind if people want to air their anti-Christian, anti-any religion views in adult books but THEY SHOULD NOT BE TRYING TO SELL THEIR VIEWS TO CHILDREN.  That is just sick. Besides, the second book stunk.  Hopefully, the movie sanitized the anti-Christian views.
B000HEZF0E|4.0|The first two films, although redone in 1080p is still not quite on par with the 3rd.  The first movie especially you see a little bit of grains.  The second movie, you seen an improvement, but it's the 3rd one where you get to enjoy the true High Definition experience in terms of video quality and audio sound.  But this series is really a must-get due to it's action and explosions. This HD DVD set is really a great buy.

B000VBJEFK|5.0|Normally, I don't watch too many pixar films as it doesn't interest me.  I didn't think I would like Ratatouille at first and I was thinking what's so great about a rat controlling a human to cook.  But when I saw it, the story itself was actually very interesting.  This film is really worth owning.  It's amazing that you can see the hair on the rat with 1080p, but it's almost just as good with normal DVD upconverted.  Animation is animation.  Visually when upconverted, they fair better than real life movie upconverts.  This time, I have to give a thumbs up to pixar. (BTW, this was played on the PS3 so I didn't get a chance to experience issues with standalones).

B000Y179KO|5.0|The Facts:  It's been 28 years since the Eagles produced a studio album.<br /><br />Founding members Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon are not in the line-up, nor is former member Don Felder.<br /><br />Current Members:  Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Joe Walsh and Timothy B. Schmit play all guitar, keyboards, bass, drums and percussion.  There are seven additional musicians that help round out the edges of this 20-track/2 Disc album.  These guys help add some real band music using real trumpets, trombones, sax, violin and steel guitar.<br /><br />This is one of the most meticulously crafted albums the Eagles have ever done, without over-producing the heck out of it.  Most of the songs have their trademark vocal harmonies and song arrangements.  In fact, you will definitely be reminded of some former big (and little) hits.  I can think of \\"Take It Easy\\", \\"Hotel California\\", \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\", \\"New Kid In Town\\", \\"Best Of My Love\\" and more.  What has been added are more guitar solos, both fast and pensive.  There's been a lot of thought and work put into these 20 songs and every member has equally contributed.  There's not a dud in the set.  I have to admit to being very surprised to hear the quality of the music come through and the inclusion of real instruments, instead of synthesized, is a grand welcome addition in this age of electronic musical short cuts.<br /><br />There are songs to make you dance and songs to break your heart.  The Eagles have brought back the old and brought in the new with an inspired set of instant classics.  These will stand the test of time just as well as their former efforts, if not more.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|The teaming of Pen&eacute;lope Cruz and Pedro Almod&oacute;var is something to behold. Everytime these two join together, you can always expect something great to result. Volver is no exception. After such mediocre American films, it was nice to see Pen&eacute;lope Cruz go back and make a Spanish langage film. She is absolutely fantastic in this movie and it is perhaps the best film of her carrer. sShe plays the role with such honesty and heart it is difficult not to feel and understand what she is going through. Every action she takes has affects everone around her and the way she is able to deal with everything that happens in her life is whatmakes this film the gem it is. It is easy to see why she was nominated for an oscar.
6304936303|3.0|I love Bruce Willis - despite the fact that his characters tend to be one-dimensional, and the movies he's in tend to be heavy on explosives and light on plot. I am a hard core Die Hard fan (even the third and fourth installments). However, I was not thrilled with \\"The Last Boy Scout\\"    This movie was basically a Die Hard sequel with more gore and with a slightly less likable lead character. Cop-like character down on his luck - check. Same character having problems with wife - check. Same character spending most of the movie killing people, shouting one liners, and eventually saving the day - check, check, check.    I also DID find this movie to be misogynistic. I'm a little frustrated that most of the other reviewers didn't notice this aspect. The first woman we see (apart from cheerleaders) is a bare-breasted woman being held under water by a football player. We then get close-ups on a stripper's body parts while she dances - and is then killed. One main male character admits to cheating on his woman (said stripper) early in the movie. Finally, the \\"romantic\\" one liner is Bruce Willis saying \\"f#ck  you\\" to his wife. Not really the most woman loving of films ...    However, I did occasionally laugh, and I did enjoy the surprise ending of the first football game we got to watch (though I was not sure how this played into the rest of the movie). And, of course, I do love snarky Bruce Willis ...
B000VNMMR0|2.0|This movie was ridiculous. Willis' character is more like Superman, Batman, Wolverine and The Hulk all rolled into one. He is inhuman and more like his character in Unbreakable than the origional character in Die Hard.<br /><br />The movie is so full of unbelievable action and stunts that it just seems like the director and writer were trying to take you on a roller coaster ride just for the the hell of it. The story is stupid and the dialogue is horrible.<br /><br />The could have called this Die Hard 4 Cannot Die So What Is The Point.
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|This movie is all about Kathern Hepburn. She carries the movie from beginning to end with her endearing charm and wit. She is so much fun to watch and never disappoints. You can see why she was such a big star. Of course the movie wouldn't be what it was without its leading men. Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart play opposite her with such ease, charm, and sex appeal and the result is a highly entertaining film that is fun to watch all the way through. This is one of the great films of all time that features some of the greatest actors to ever grace the screen.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I have no complaints. The product was delivered as promised. And I love this wonderful irish classical group.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|After reading many reviews of this movie raving about it as an action film, denouncing it as historically inaccurate, or anything in between, I would like to propose a different view.  Think of this movie as alternate history, the way things should have been, so to speak.  Anyone familiar with Marcus Aurelius the philosopher will recognize that Maximus was the embodiment of his ideal man:  at one with the universe, standing up to any adversity, accepting of all humanity, yet willing to fight for what is good and noble in the world, while recognizing how wretched the world can be.  If Marcus Aurelius could have created his heir, he would have created Maximus. Commodus was, historically, a wretched, depraved man.  While the facts about Commodus were incorrect in Gladiator, his character was aptly portrayed.  The story in this great movie - and I do think it is a great movie - could have been written by Marcus Aurelius himself: the way things s'posed to be.  Strength and honor!
B000001GXJ|5.0|I happened to see this production in paris in the late 70's with the singers as in the CD, conductor Abbado, director Giorgio Strehler, and it is still engraved in my memory as one of those truly magical moments that justify years of listening to poor performances. The final act, the death of simon, was a moment of absollute beauty, with the two tremendous voices of Capuccilli dying and ghiaurov realising he is losing a son ...  It is true that Simon is not an easy opera, there are few aris, and the titel role has not a single aria. For those who like easy opera, go to Carmen, or traviata, or boheme (which incidentally I love and have seen many times with good (ah! boheme with freni-domingo!!, cosi with te kanawa and ludwig!!!) or less good singers and directors. Simon is second-grade opera: you graduate to simon once you start understanding what opera is really all about: sit, let the music immerge you (especially simon with its marine leitmotiv), and spend 2 or 3 hours (or 5 if its wagner) in another universe...  The recording is almost as good as the real thing, but since there no hope to ever see these singers together again, buy the record, close your eyes, and \\"bon voyage\\"
B000JLQSW4|3.0|It is 1977, and defiantly \\"prog\\" in the year of \\"punk\\" comes this second release from the Alan Parsons Project. Reading a science fiction novel, and imagining an entire album around it, because Parsons wasn't a filmmaker, is certainly taking the idea of the \\"concept\\" album beyond just a \\"song cycle\\" or \\"dream theatre\\", and more in the realm of a movie soundtrack without the movie. It is more \\"soundtrack\\" than \\"song cycle\\", because the songs lead into each other, following the model of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", which Parsons also had a hand in the engineering of. But this goes way beyond \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" in the aforementioned concept.  Without ever having read the novel, or having seen the recently released movie (And, boy, isn't Parsons probably kicking himself that he didn't have a hand in the soundtrack some 25 years later!) I can listen to this album all the way through, and picture in my mind what this story might be all about.   The album begins with the instrumental track, \\"I Robot\\" (sounds like a song that would be playing during the opening credits of a movie). And the first vocal number is \\"I Wouldn't Want to be Like You\\" (sort of an unassuming opening to the movie). \\"Some Other Time\\" (suspicion starts to grow from our story's possible hero). \\"Breakdown\\" (someone finally freaks out about what is going on around him). \\"Don't Let it Show\\" (our hero develops a new strategy for combating his enemy). \\"The Voice\\" (sounds like a \\"chase scene\\", where our story's villain his chasing the hero). \\"Day After Day\\" (a song of despair from the hero after the villain wins). \\"Genesis Ch.1 V.32\\" (sounds like a song that is playing at the closing credits of the movie.) And there you have it. A perfect \\"movieless\\" soundtrack!  The use of vocals on this album is also quite unique. Apparently, the way the \\"Alan Parsons Project\\" is set up, instead of using one singer to alter his voice depending on the mood of the song, various singers with different vocal stylings were delegated to each different song, depending on the type of song it was (mellow, sad, angry, or bluesy. In that sense, I think Parsons took his cue from Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, the way he instinctively knew, for instance, that Mike Love was right for the \\"party songs\\" he wrote, or that his brother Carl Wilson sounded best on the \\"love ballads\\", Al Jardine had a voice that was right for the silly numbers, etc. I think Parsons also took some vocal concepts from the Yardbirds in his extensive use of \\"gregorian chants\\" throughout this disc. The addition of brass and string intruments also help to elevate this album beyond a \\"concept album\\" and into the realm of \\"movie soundtrack\\".  On this and other albums of a \\"sci-fi\\" nature, I think Parsons fancied himself as the musical equivalent to Steven Spielberg, and in a lot of ways, he was. I can't help but think that his ultimate goal was to go to work as the musical director for either Spielberg or George Lucas. Or was just waiting for the chance to use the music from this album as a soundtrack for a future \\"I Robot\\" movie release that never happened. Whatever the case, \\"I Robot\\" moved the idea of the \\"concept album\\" beyond where no man has gone before, during the most unlikely of musical eras when \\"punk\\" was raging against such excess.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I gave this album five stars when i thought it deserved a three because i am a fan of hers but i only liked a few of her songs on this album i jveust hope that her next album is better!! but BRITNEY SPEARS is still on her feet despite what's happend to her! i have confident that after all she's gone through settles down her career will get better
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I had the extreme privilege of seeing this show in Las Vegas, and let me tell you, this is a feast for the eyes and ears.  The visuals and dancers bring a fresh wave to Dion's classics. The stage is huge and the background LCD screen in the largest in North America, bringing an intense scenic appeal to Celine's fabulous singing.  The combination of high energy and soft moments all graced with sensational vocals gives you an hour and a half of pure concert entertainment.  They've done a fantastic, high quality job of capturing the energy and unique experience the show offers live. Dion does not disappoint, it's a  MUST SEE!
B000SZLSB2|5.0|If you liked his first CD you will really like this one.  A must buy.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|What a great movie for the whole family!  I can watch this over and over again!<br /><br />The animation is very good, and the story line is excellent.  It's creative, out of the box, and down right funny!
B000VBJEEG|4.0|This is a fun movie but not really for kids as advertised. It is a little slow paced and no real action to keep kids interests.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is the best animated movie I've seen in 50 years. Really captures the imagination, and makes you think it's characters are really alive. The rat \\"pack\\" is terrific. The characters mimic reality to the nth degree.    Wonderful film for all ages!
B000I62JAK|1.0|This movie is so bad I couldn't sit through more than 20 minutes.  please don't buy or rent this horrable movie
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Wow! All I can say is if you like action movies you are going to love this one! The special effects are breathtaking. In my opinion, this is the best Die Hard movie so far. McClain is meaner, tougher and more indestructable than ever. This is one DVD that I will definitely be watching again!
B000M5AJQS|4.0|This is a great movie made even better with a 2-disc special edition. The extras are surprisingly interesting for this intense cop drama/thriller.
B00000DHRX|4.0|As cheesy as some of George Michaels' music may seem, between his solo work and his time with Wham, he created some of the most enduring melodic pop of the 80's. While his 90's work found him drifting into middle-age minus the effervescence ([[ASIN:B000005ALN Older]]) and the new century found his music less interesting than his public exploits ([[ASIN:B00020SHH6 Patience]] is not that bad, however), this collection shows Michael's influence to be strong and bearing repeat hearings.<br /><br />Dividing this CD into two volumes is interesting in that it forces his contrasts into a sharp relief. While his ballads became some of his biggest hits, Michael's also tended to get cheesier as he got older...mistaking stateliness for maturity. It was in the period where he created \\"Faith,\\" when he was willing to try all sorts of styles, including the exquisite \\"Kissing a Fool's\\" light jazz. There are still some incredible songs in his ballads disc (subtitled \\"For The Heart\\"), like \\"Father Figure\\" and his version of \\"I Can't Make You Love Me.\\" No less an elder statesman than Elton John gave his seal of approval on their live duet of \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me.\\" It was both his last number one single and played a significant role in reestablishing Elton's star-power in the 90's. There is also no denying the emotional force in \\"Jesus to a Child\\" (the best song on \\"Older\\") and the John Lennon derived \\"Praying For Time.\\"<br /><br />However it's the second \\"For The Feet\\" disc that is the real heart of George Michael's mega-success. Everything here, even the lame \\"Older\\" stuff, is instant party music. He was a master at effortless hooks, making staples like \\"Freedom 90\\" and his duet with Aretha Franklin, \\"I Knew You Were Waiting For Me\\" classic pop. He remains a great interpreter, as his covers of Seal's \\"Killer\\" and Elton's \\"Don't Let...\\" prove. This also contains the set's biggest flaw in that \\"I Want You Sex\\" isn't the worldwide hit version, but part II from the [[ASIN:B0000026CH Faith]] CD, which just seems ignorant.<br /><br />That is part of the reason for the four-star rating of \\"Ladies and Gentlemen.\\" Had George clipped this to a single disc of actual hits (maybe even splitting it between a disc of Wham and a disc of his solo recordings) minus the filler (\\"Desafinado,\\" \\"Waiting For That Day\\"), this could have been a dynamite time capsule of Michaels' career. Since he has released three more albums since, perhaps it's time for an update. Till then, I put in disc two every so often for the perfect pop that is \\"Faith\\" and \\"Too Funky.\\"D, which just seems ignorant.

0812550706|5.0|This book will grab you and not let go.  It's the story of a boy sometime in the future when humans are at war with an alien species.  There are some Orwellian influences in the human society which are interesting to think about.  The book has excitement and adventure that will keep you reading but the best part is the look it takes at humanity and human interaction.  This book is very different from Orson Scott Card's other works but he definitely has a talent for story-telling.  There are 3 sequels to this book (Speaker For the Dead, Xeniocide, and Children of the Mind) which are just as good but the story can be complete with just Ender's Game.    If you enjoy these books Card wrote another series related to it.  He takes \\"Bean,\\" a minor character from Ender's Game, and tells his story before and after what happens in Ender's Game.  The \\"Bean\\" series begins with Ender's Shadow.  If you're a Sci-Fi fan or enjoy introspection on humanity, this book will interest you.
0385338686|4.0|This was pretty much a basic, light, fun read. It was kind of typical, and I could pretty much guess the ending. Still, I enjoyed reading it. If this book weren't funny and didn't have Sophie Kinsella's unique writing style, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. But as it is, it was fairly enjoyable and entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone for a fun read, but not if you're looking for something serious and thought-provoking.

1416905014|5.0|I snuck this book into my cart at Costco last year for my four year old for Christmas. I am still in awe of how intricate the pop ups are after a year of owning it. I work in preschools and took the book with me to class. The class of 15 three-year-olds sat perfectly still while I read it. This year I am ordering it for my 3-year-old niece to enjoy and can't wait for her to open it. I only wish I wasn't 3000 miles away so I could see her reaction. This book makes a perfect gift for any child-young or old- but must be played with gently!
B000MM1F5A|5.0|This is absolutely THE best Mariza!....  not just because of her voice and animation but because of the DVD which gives an amazing and entertaining history of Fado.  Seeing her entertaining an audience has stayed with me and I 'replay' it in my mind when ever I go to another CD of hers.  So interesting to hear how an audience in Portugal responds with so much respect for the performer and her presentation... falling into appreciative silence as she begins to sing.  This woman doesn't just sing... she gives me hope and happy.  So 'UP'.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I have had this CD on continuous play in my car. Amy Winehouse has such a fantastic voice, it is put to good use on every song except maybe \\"f***k Me Pumps\\", the weakest song on the CD. \\"Take the Box\\" is so melancholy and beautiful as is \\"In My Bed\\". I highly recommend this CD.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I saw and loved the movie. Went right out and got the CD. Played it a few times on while driving around - it is really excellent on the road music. The gal who sounds like Janis Joplin sounds more like Janis than Janis herself... Nice interpretations of the Beatles finest music. Loved Joe Cocker especially.
B000WO251Q|2.0|This is my first, and maybe last Nicolas Sparks book. I read it simply because of the military situation. It was a bit boring, but found it to be a quick read. I had absolutely no interest in Savannah at all. What was so great about her? My deal was with John. As short as their relationship was, I wanted to tell him to \\"Get over it already!\\". His depression when they are apart, to the point where he was an outcast with his other squad members in his unit, was just pitiful. No friends? Kept to himself. Whatever. The only true interest in this story was John's relationship with his father. I'm going to stick with Spark's movies only.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|The best tribute i have ever seen. Eric and friends could not have done a better job. The love and respect poured off the screen. Every musician was there for George and his family. The last song by Joe Brown brought a tear to my eye and still does every time i watch it.
0761145613|4.0|It has gorgeous drawings, but I did expected more space to write and more variety of stickers. I think I made I mistake, because is like for kids stuff, and I was looking for something else. Still is cute
B000VSBX34|5.0|I liked how this movie was in color, set aside from the other Beatles movie that was released in black and white, \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" to be certain. The Beatles had so many great songs in this film, songs that are featured on their album \\"Help!\\" such as the title song, and other great hits like \\"Another Girl,\\" \\"You're Gonna Lose That Girl,\\" \\"Ticket To Ride,\\" \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away,\\" and \\"I Need You.\\" The songs are all in their original recordings as is on the \\"Help!\\" album, released in 1965. A must-have for any and all die-hard Beatles fans of all ages!!!
0679809015|5.0|This book may be small, but it's sturdy and has tons of pages for its size. It's perfect for throwing in our \\"to-go\\" bag. My 15 month old son loves it!
0679746323|4.0|Well I read this book after I went to China for a graduation present which was at least 1 or 2 years ago, I'm 21 now.  And I would like to form my own opinon.  I'm very confused.  Was Mao really that horrible?  Did he really kill more people then Stalin and Hitler?  Well I could kind of believe that part, due to the fact that there are more people in China then in Europe and Russia.  This truth is hard to handle, espcially considering the fact that I didn't learn about Communist China in high school.  Oh yah I learned about the Holocost and Stalinist Russia, but never about Maoist China!      Well the book starts out with Mao being forced to marry \\"was it his cousin\\"?  Well she was older then he was and when she died, well he didn't really care.      But if Mao was really that inhuman then the writter of the book did a good job at making it seem that way.  And it seems to me that he makes Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia look like boy scouts compared to what went on behind closed doors in China.     And it said that Mao was responisble for the deaths of over 70- to maybe 80 million people?  Hard to believe isn't it?  Maybe, but like I said, there are more people in China then almost anywhere else in the world.      And when I went to China, I was told by my mother to keep my mouth shut about the government and about Mao.  WTF?!  Ok so am I going to keep my mouth shut about Hitler if I go to Germany?  Or Russia about Stalin?  But then again I was a guest in their country.  So if you ever go to a country like China, then keep your mouth shut, and you'll have a great time!      But if Mao really did commit those crimes.  I know darn well that karma will come back to him one of these days, even if it take a few centuries.
B000YENUI6|5.0|I emphasized the \\"ADULT-THEMED\\" idea in my title because one of the best things about seeing a film like EASTERN PROMISES is that it is so adult, so uncompromised. Cronenberg gets to make the movies he wants to, and it doesn't have to be watered down or dumbed-down to make it sell to a broad audience. We get a brutal, sometimes squirm-inducing look at a underworld we haven't seen like this before...and there's no gloss, no pandering to a teen audience, no sappy ending, etc. etc. The ending is SATISFYING...but it isn't easy or \\"Hollywood.\\"     First of all, the script is outstanding. From the creator of another stunning film about London's \\"seamy underbelly,\\" DIRTY PRETTY THINGS...the plot makes sense, the threads all come together and the characters are simply but sharply delineated. Yet at no time do I feel the themes are being spoon-fed. Also, some of the acts that are perpetrated on Viggo Mortensen's character near the end of the film are acts of amazing betrayal...yet if you haven't been paying attention, you might miss that. It's not a super-complex plot...but it doesn't grab you by the hand and lead you from place to place.     Speaking of Mortensen...this is his best performance ever. Granted, Aragon is crown-jewel, and he handled it well...but those films were events, such spectacle that often what he simply needed to do was wear his costume, ride his horse and look great. In EASTERN PROMISES, he has to make us care about a very nasty piece of work indeed. He's also very stony-faced...so much of what we learn about him, especially early on, comes from very subtle work. Again, each word of the script is perfectly chosen, and Mortensen digs deep here. He's not always my favorite actor...I actually wasn't nuts about him in A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE (A film I otherwise greatly admired)...but he's perfectly cast here. And of course, he's amazing to watch in the now infamous nude fight scene. It's a little bit distracting being aware of male full-frontal nudity flashing around...almost enough to take one out of the scene...but the scene is so well staged that the sheer PAIN of it soon wipes out any feeling of \\"hey, we get to see ALL of Viggo Mortensen.\\"     Armin Mueller-Stahl plays the older patriarch of the Russian mafia family, and he's the best of this type of character I've seen in awhile. You know the one...the old gangster who is so sweet and loving to the youngsters in his family, so polite and full of grace and manners. Picture Brando in the wedding scenes of THE GODFATHER or even Paul Newman in early scenes of ROAD TO PERDITION. Stahl is even better...his eyes twinkle with charm. But boy, when the mask drops and we see the real guy...still soft-spoken and considered...he's stunningly evil. I really enjoyed seeing him again...it seems like it's been awhile since he was in a film.     Vincent Cassel plays Stahl's hot-headed son...another gangster cliche...the kid who is supposed to take over the business, but is actually a bit of a moron and troublemaker. But again, the character has surprises up its sleeve. Also, Naomi Watts plays the nurse who brings a motherless baby unwittingly into this underworld...and she is reliably good. Her character doesn't get to have all the dramatic flourishes...but Watts gives another patented, fully committed, honest performance. I believe she may be our most under-rated actress, even though she has been nominated for awards and starred in many films...I think she's still undervalued. EASTERN PROMISES won't win her new fans or an Oscar...but she is still very good.     Notice I didn't talk much about the plot. Others have done it better, and to be honest, I'd love it if you just went to see the film having little idea of what you were about to experience. It's a brutal journey...but it is full of unexpected turns...not just of plot but of character. I'll bet come year end, this will still be one of my favorites of the year! Highly, highly recommended for ADULT audiences!!
B000UR9T8C|4.0|I can say that I have never sat thru a Spiderman movie until this one.  Spiderman 3 is a simple movie with quite a bit of action.  Actually for anyone with a lack of attention this movie is great.  Yeah I would be included in that grouping.<br /><br />I guess what makes Spiderman so likable is that he isn't like so many other super heros.  He isn't a muscle man and his powers are pretty simple.  His enemies almost always seem stronger than him.  The enemies even seem to have a human side.<br /><br />I didn't really feel any letdowns.  The action was there from the get go and it seemed like every villain was after Spiderman.  The real villain was Spidermans alter-ego.  Coming from a black goo and transforming Spidermans suit.  This goo actually caused Spidey to be a little more evil and a lot less forgiving.  Of course there were several good battles that made everything worthwhile even when everything else was lacking.<br /><br />This movie won't have you yelling for more but it sure will give you a fun ride.  The action is intense and never seems to end.  The acting was so-so and seemed like the same story-line from other Spiderman movies.  Although with the negative this is still a good movie.  A great movie for families or anyone who has enjoyed the series.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This was a great movie. It was both inspiring and eye opening and I wish it had reached a wider audience. There are so many true stories that go untold and I'm so glad this one got out.
B000AYELVA|5.0|This fantastic sci-fi/action film made in 2000 is a good versus evil super hero type.<br /><br />The movie opens with a scene out of World War II that shows people who are born different from the ruling society, being treated cruely.  One of these people turns out to be the villianous character, Magneto (Ian McKellen).  Magneto holds a grudge against mankind and has an accomplice, Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) who can change into many shapes and forms.<br /><br />We are introduced to Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart)who runs a school for mutants that teaches them to harness their powers for the good of mankind.  These mutants possess extraordinary and dangerous powers which are the result of genetic mutations. Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) grows metal weapons from his fists.  Cyclops (James Marsden) unleashes bolts of energy from his eyes. Storm (Halle Berry) can manipulate the weather. Rogue (Annna Paquin) absorbs the life force of anyone she touches. But these mutants must protect those who fear them as Magneto reveals his  plan for the future!<br /><br />I wanted to see all the X Men movies as my friend is currently working on the prequel, \\"Wolverine\\" starring Hugh Jackman in Australia and I promised him I would view them all.<br /><br />This film has enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat.  The special effects are amazing! The sound on the DVD is so realistic on a home theater system that it had my heart pounding!  I was thoroughly amazed with this movie.  It is only 104 minutes, but packs so much action you're never bored.  Watch it, you'll be totally amazed!
B000YN369A|5.0|Mellow electronic pop music with some serious beats. \\"Such Great Heights\\" is instantly recognizable as the song featured in the UPS Brown commercials. Ben Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie)delivers reserved vocals over dancing keyboard melodies, distorted bass, and foot tapping tempos.   Overall, this is an EXCELLENT album. I never listened to Death Cab, but came across this album on Pandora and immediately fell in love with it. Having now gone back and listened to Death Cab, I wish Ben would focus more on The Postal Service!
B00005JPCF|1.0|An anti-family film in the guise of a family film, this one takes its target audience, children, into the adult world of its creators.  The music, the message, and the out of place attempt at \\"hip\\" all take the kid inside this adult where he does not want to go and does not want his kids to go.      Our kids had asked us to stop this one and put something else in the player.  Do your kids and yourself a favor and do the same.
B00005JKHP|4.0|As the first of the \\"Trek\\" movie franchise, this interesting motion picture goes on its own path. While the story of a most unusual first contact gets somewhat tedious at times, its very much a \\"Star Trek\\" type of story, with the original cast all present and accounted for, though they have to share the spotlight with some newcomers. In many ways, the plot more closely resembles the next generation more than the first, and had to be thought of as a very different type of adventure compared to the \\"me too\\" type of sci-fi pictures that were coming out in that post \\"Star Wars\\" era.   That said, the new directors cut gave us the chance to see a somewhat cleaned up, and visually more impressive experience, with at least some of the interplay between the major characters restored. Of course, it still doesn't make the climax entirely understandable. But I still think that it is a fine film. It won't leave you on the edge of your seat, but it will leave you satisfied.
B000001E21|4.0|For those of us who remember Def Leppard from the early 80's, they were a METAL band - kind of a mix of Iron Maiden and AC/DC.  Then Hysteria came out and they drifted more into a rock direction (although back then we still considered that metal).  The 90's and so forth would see them slide even more from their hard-rockin' guitar-based roots, reaching a pop nadir with X.    However, Retroactive showed they could still do guitar-based rock while trying new things.  Songs like \\"Desert Song\\" and \\"From the Inside\\" sound like nothing they'd done before, yet still had the Def Leppard magic.  They were, in fact, progressing as a great band should - this is what Slang should've been (but instead, Slang was Def Leppard almost completely rejecting their own sound for a second-rate grunge alternative wannabe sound).  Suffice to say, Retroactive shows a band that can rock, with some of the Def Leppard polish (but not as highly produced as Hysteria or Euphoria), and a batch of good and diverse songs.  The only weak point(s) of the CD for me are the cliche ballads (Two Steps Behind and Miss You In A Heartbeat - both offered in multiple versions here!), which are weak and sound like they could be by any second-rate hair metal band, not even having the Def Leppard ballad sound.  (I Wanna Be Your Hero is a good Def Leppard ballad track).  Anyway, if you like any Def Leppard album from the 80's or just classic hard rock/metal, you should like this.
B000O178BY|4.0|Look, I hated \\"With Teeth\\" with a passion. So much so, that I had no intention on buying \\"Year Zero\\" when I first heard about it. But one day while walking through my local record store, I saw it on sale for ten dollars, and thought that I ought to at least give it a try. And am I glad I did, because for the past eight months \\"Year Zero\\" has been faily close to my CD player at all time.  On \\"With Teeth\\" Reznor seemed to be trying to reclaim some former glory and did it by dumbing down his music with trite, whiny lyrics and boring mid-ninties industrial-metal guitars.  But it seems with the semi-success of \\"With Teeth\\" Reznor figured something out. In fact, \\"Year Zero\\" could have a sub title that would read something like \\"Year Zero; or How I Learned To Not Care About Commerical Porspects and Learned to Love the Cult\\". On \\"Year Zero\\", Reznor has made a record that will not appeal too much outside of the cult, but will greatly please both the new fans Reznor picked up on \\"With Teeth\\" and even bring back some of those who felt burned by that record.  On \\"Year Zero\\" Reznor has concocted a concept record that takes place fifteen years in the future when the government controls the church, is run by a power hungry individual whose name \\"begins with a Capitol G\\". There is something to do with a group of people rising up against the government, about drugs being supplemented into the water supply, things like that. To be honest with you, like most concept albums, the story line is fairly incoherant. Though by doing a record that exists outside of his own psyche, Reznor sounds better than ever. Even though he's still far from Dylan, \\"Year Zero\\"'s concept frees up Reznor, and he shows considerable growth as a lyricist here.  But the real surprise here is music. This is easily Reznor's finest hour, as it is both his most cohesive piece of work since \\"Downward Spiral\\", but also his most song orientated ever. Nearly all of the songs on \\"Year Zero\\" have memorable melodies, and many of them have grooves that most dance producers would kill for. There is a looseness that makes up \\"Year Zero\\" that every other Nails record lacked, and here Reznor sounds like he actually enjoyed the process. \\"Year Zero\\" also manages to be completley dense while also being really tight and loose. You can listen to this one for weeks with headphones on and find new stuff every time, or you can just enjoy it in the background.  \\"Year Zero\\" isn't quite a masterpiece, but it is the best record that Reznor has ever made. It is melodic and funky, well put together and a fairly easy listen. Music fans in general should all like \\"Year Zero\\", as it has something for everyone without trying to be anything to anyone.  Easily one of the best records of the year.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he can't stop watching it!  Fabulous product.  Excellent service as always.  The clarity is amazing and it is astounding how action-packed this can be.  Don't miss it!
B000VNMMR0|4.0|The stunts are amazing. Destruction and mayhem are in the extreme. The bad guys are intelligent and tough. The relationship between Willis and the young hacker played by Olyphant is entertaining. Using the daughter as the damsel in distress is a good idea. The original Die Hard is better, but this one is good and very exciting. I found myself saying aloud, \\"Wow!\\" at some of the stunts.    The bad aspects are pretty minor for a movie like this. Multiple systems are hacked with less keystrokes than it would take to log onto most systems. There are highly improbably incidents that defy the imagination. Willis intentionally hits a flying helicopter with a car. No ramp or incline visible. A toy falls off a shelf and hits the delete key on a computer that is rigged to detonate a bomb at a very good moment for the good guys. I could go on, but I'll stop.     The movie overwhelming strengths make up for the weaknesses. The Die Hard series have been remarkably consistent and \\"Live Free\\" is a good addition.
B000002H33|5.0|Yes there are faster metal albums, more epic metal albums, better produced metal albums but you will never get to them unless you take this journey. This is THE album to get if you want to aquaint yourself or someone else with metal music in its true form.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|I'm one of those who saw the movie when it came out in 1976, more than once in fact. It was an immediate 'Saturday midnight' favorite where I grew up (Belgium). By then the band's reputation was larger than life and there simply was not much of an opportunity ever to see them live. I bought the double-album when it came out, and I never understood why the album was so much maligned by both fans and critics. I thought it was pretty darn good. Now after 31 years, and amid a frenzy of renewed Led Zeppelin activity (catalog on iTunes, the \\"Mothership\\" best of, and of course the upcoming one-off show in London--among swirling rumors the band may tour proper in 2008), now comes a newly expanded version of this album.<br /><br />On \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" (2 CDs; 15 tracks; 132 min.), the first CD starts off with the classic \\"Rock and Roll\\" and \\"Celebration Day\\", then dives straight into 4 previously unreleased tracks, including a rousing \\"Misty Mountain Top\\", but even better is the slowburner \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\". CD1 (10 tracks, 60 min.) finishes with 4 songs from the \\"Houses of the Holy\\" album, which the band was touring behind at the time, including a previously unreleased \\"The Ocean\\". It is impossible for me to listen to \\"No Quarter\\" and not think of the John Paul Jones 'fantasy sequences' in the movie. CD2 (5 tracks, 72 min.) brings one more new track (\\"Heartbreaker\\") but the lead-off track, a 25 min. epic \\"Dazed and Confused\\" towers over everything else. It is for me the ultimate Led Zeppelin track. I usually skip \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" (overrated and played to death on classic radio), but still like the \\"Moby Dick\\" drum solo, as well as the closer \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".<br /><br />The remastering by Jimmy Page sounds fantastic, and the packaging (with nice liner notes from Cameron Crow, with lines like : \\"The brown cardboard sing in the window simply read 'It's here'\\"--referring to the release of Led Zep II in late 1969) is done quite nicely. All in all, I am really pleased with the remastered and expanded CD release of \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", which is like discovering a new album in the Led Zeppelin catalog. (Incidentally, I did get to see the band in concert once, on their 1980 European tour, only months before John Bonham passed away.)sed with the remastered and expanded CD release of \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", which is like discovering a new album in the Led Zeppelin catalog.

B000A6T1KE|1.0|I grew up with the TNG crew, since I was young I watched the show every week until it ended. I thought the series was incredible and definately one of the all time sci-fi greats. I'm a proud owner of all the Star Trek TNG Season DVD sets and I even enjoy the Generations and Insurrection movies! But this movie is just absolutely horrid with suprisingly no redeeming qualities. I mean at least 'The Final Frontier', which is widely regarded as Trek's worst, had its -characters- fronting the film. I didnt recognize anyone in this disaster.<br /><br />The writing is very weak with most of the characters completely ignored. I think Geordi has 2 lines throughout the enitire movie, which on top of everything are delivered badly. He, as well as most of the others looked tired and uninspired by the script. The person that wrote this screenplay didn't know the characters half as well as the average TNG fan. He simply got all of the characters WRONG. Picard does things he never would do, Data isn't himself at all and appears bitter throughout the movie, etc. The actual storyline is laughable and it seems like the plot was developed around the redundant action sequences rather than the other way around.<br /><br />Every Star Trek movie from Trek 1-9 and all the shows including Voyager and Enterprise have atleast some element of the Star Trek spirit. This film is completely devoid of that spirit. If you are a self-respecting Star Trek (or TNG) fan avoid this like the plague. The story ends so badly for our beloved characters that it simply isnt worth seeing. I mean it, this movie will leave a bad taste in the mouth of any real trek fan and ruin a legacy. TNG ended with the masterful final episode of the series \\"All Good Things\\". That is the sendoff they deserved and the end that should be remembered. Trek movies 7-9 can be enjoyed for fluff but this movie should be AVOIDED. I hope I've made my point.
B00008WT5E|5.0|I can't stop listening to this CD lately; I musta heard it 4 or 5 times yesterday! While initially introduced to AC/DC YEARS ago thru If You Want Blood, then Back in Black, and of course those and Highway To Hell are classics, this album hits the spot for me more than the others. Bon wanted to have lighter subject matter for what became Highway To Hell, and it worked; that album is a great one about sex and partying.   So what! This album is so fantastic, it's criminally underrated.  Rock 'n Roll Damnation was added at the last moment by Atlantic for they felt there was nothing \\"radio-friendly\\" on this. What about Sin City?!  This album is a moody, sensuous album, sometimes desperate in its desire; witness Gimme A Bullet (\\"I'll make believe it's you\\"--WOW!); Kicked In The Teeth is about, well, that wrong kinda woman again (probably a Scorpio one--they're Evil!!). Gone Shootin' is a beautiful slower one--I'll take this over The Jack anyday! It has a great groove to it; there's a radio broadcast from Boston that shows it was played at a faster pace live which surely DID add to it, but it's still a cool groover here anyhow. Riff Raff? What needs to be said about that monster! Okay, this one is better (maybe) on If You Want Blood --it's arguable.  And dig how MENACING the part of Sin City sounds where the song drops down; it never sounded better live, with lines like \\"ladders give...snakes take\\"...\\"ain't got a hope in hell, that's my belief\\". Sounds like Bon's saying, We're all doomed, I'm gonna have a great time while I CAN! That was kinda his aim anyway, wasn't it?  Now for the truly greatest moment on here...Down Payment Blues!!   Down Payment Blues is surely one of the greatest songs AC/DC EVER did, a lost CLASSIC; (why do bands forget their best songs sometimes? like, what ever happened to Shake a Leg from Back In Black, they never played it after that tour, did they? It was forgotten, regardless.)  Down Payment Blues was noted by Slash in Rolling Stone as one of his favorite songs -- now, I ain't no Guns and Roses fan, but he's a good guitarist, and showed some mighty fine taste there!  He said something about how the chord changes are brilliant on it; well, I'll have to agree (tho he surely knows about it like I don't; I can just hear it and FEEL it).  It has some of my favorite AC/DC lyrics as well -- \\"I got holes in my shoes and I'm way overdue\\"...\\"I got myself a cadillac but I can't afford the gasoline\\" (and this was before gas cost gold dust!)  Best line: \\"Doing nothing means a lot to me\\" -- A-MEN!!! This states what he sang in Rock 'n' Roll Singer, but a WHOLE lot better, and -- it's to the point! Short but oh so FINE!!   He can't afford the rent, but bring on the champagne! \\"Can't even feed my cat with Social Security\\"--WOAH, that's a depressing line!  But the song isn't, it's a f---ing masterpiece! The best song these guys ever did!!!  Man, I can't recommend this album enough. I only wish the European version-- with a great song not on here, and different mixes on 6 songs (!!!) (drool!!) -- was available on CD. I never even heard it on vinyl, and I used to have everything these guys ever did, practically. AND here's the rub here-- the missing song \\"Cold Hearted Man\\" (which I thankfully have in my vinyl box as a 12\\" single) -- is FANTASTIC. WHAT the HELL is WRONG with record companies?? If they're in it for the money only--and lets not pretend they care about ANYTHING else-- why isn't there another version available , the \\"other\\" one?? Afraid it might sell and make some money, ya bozos?? Stupid record companies!!  That aside, this is my absolute favorite AC/DC disc, above back In Black, my second fave. Both are awesome, but this one ain't got the recognition it deserves.    Malcolm HIMSELF said \\"I know a lot of people respect it. A lot of real rock and roll AC/DC fans, the real pure rock and roll guys. I think that's the most under-rated album of them all.\\"    Take a chance. Buy it. You like AC/DC, you won't be sorry.THAT'S MY BELIEF!!
B000GY729M|5.0|Sam's Town is an \\"album\\" and if you are saying, \\"well of course its an album\\" then, you just dont get it and never will. Great music, concepts, tunes it makes you get up and scream some of the anthems. It also has some great singles released like \\"when you were young\\", \\"bones\\", and \\"read my mind\\". flowers does a brillant lyrical job, and i just love the into/outro used to wrap it all into one neat powerful package
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Having enjoyed this series very much when it was first shown in 1994-95, it was a delight to see it again.  The best feature of the show was the writing--the writers seemed to know what really goes on in the lives of teenagers.  As a tenth grade teacher, I know they got it right.    The show was also extremely well acted and the actors chosen for the parts were perfect.  Claire Danes WAS Angela Chase.  Wilson Cruz was outstanding in a breakthrough role as a young gay man searching for his identity.  A.J. Langer was brilliant.    One of the best parts of this new edition is its inclusion of commentaries by many of the actors, writers and directors.  Their insightful comments illumine the understanding of the show's focus.
B000UX6TRK|5.0|Great, Lionel Richie at the top of his game. Whether you are a fan or not, this is great entertainment. Watch a Pro show you how it's done. All of the hits except \\"Penny Lover\\". Shucks, get it you'll love it.
0930289234|5.0|One of the Greatest reads that I have enjoyed.  A Graphic Novel masterpiece.  A masterfull piece of writting and illustration that gives strength to the Genre.  This cemented Alan Moore as one of my Favorite writers.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|The film by Michaeal Moore, \\"Sicko\\" is very entertaining, humorous, and frightening revealing in scope.  I feel it doesn't offer solutions to our health problem crisis in a direct way and wasn't the films intention. The film brings attention to the American people and the world how much is needed for change in the health system system as it exist today.
1400079179|3.0|For a Follow-up to Angels and Demons, I felt dissappointed.  This was a decent mystery that kept me relatively rivited, but i was able to put it down.  Slightly predictable, followed some of the same plot points contained in Angels and Demons, but with characters that were not nearly as intriguing, and to a large degree were unbelievable.<br /><br />All and all though, it was a good storyline with well researched setting and references. Grade: C+
B000RG1FMO|5.0|I expected a CD case but it was one of those tri-fold cases instead, so I don't know whether I got jipped or not.
1401207928|4.0|I felt that this was a masterfull piece of writting that created one of the most original characters ever in V himself.  It was not a Love story, it is a story about revolution and how once Big Brother is allowed to much control, the only way back to peace is Anarchy.    Awsome read.  Really Enjoyed it.
0553150367|5.0|Love this book, found the same edition to read to my children, I hope they will read it to there children one day.
B000683VI4|5.0|What a movie! I watch this movie two-three times a month. I cannot get enough of Noah and Allie. The producers could not have chosen a better cast.  One of my favorite parts is when Noah and Allie lay in the middle of the street watching the lights change. I love to hear her laugh when they have to jump up quickly when a car comes down the road.  I love their fights, their heated romances, the genuine love they have for each other. Noah sticks with Allie when her terrible disease takes over her mind. He waits with hope that Allie can remember for just a moment. Tears will spill over in your eyes when Allie remembers who Noah is, and for just a brief few minutes they capture their love for each other. Then the terrible disease comes back and she does not remember Noah, and medical attention is requires. \\"I'll Be Seeing You\\" is the perfect song that is sung by Jimmy Durante.  This movie shows that true love will carry you through all the good times and bad. Noah and Allie die in their sleep together.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a beautifully filmed documentary. The traditional superb quality of BBC documentaries is ever present but is greatly enhanced by some added technological tools such as the helicopter camera. The only thing I regret is not actually seeing Sir David Attenborough in these places. His voice and thoughtful comments are very well interlaced with the magnificent images shown of this beautiful planet.
B00003CXCD|4.0|A young princess named Ann has been a slave to duty all her life, to the point of utter unhappiness. All she longs to do is live a few moments without being poked, prodded, dressed or directed. One night while on tour in Rome she slinks away in the wee hours to have some fun as someone else.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn is simply divine as the princess who is so tired she can't sleep and Gregory Peck is dashing as the young reporter who shows her a good time on the town.<br /><br />The film is black and white but it doesn't matter because Hepburn is so captivating you quickly forget. The princess now going by the name Anya wanders around Rome experiencing the people, culture and sites. She also chops off her hair, tries some ice-cream and gets involved in some roughhousing.<br /><br />Reporter, Joe Bradley encourages her to take some time for herself, all the time pretending he doesn't know who she really is; with the intention of getting a personal story for his employer. But of course he begins to regret his underhandedness.<br /><br />Roman Holiday doesn't have your typical boy meets girl (or vice versa) and lives happily ever after romantic ending, which I was expecting, but it is not disappointing. It was a good ride while it lasted and I recommend you take it for a spin. Reviewed by M. E. Wood.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|I was happy with the price of the product and the time frame it was shipped in.
B000ICXQF6|5.0|A quirky, idio-syncatic re-working of an earlier time travel movie that moves well beyond the simplistic issues posed by the H. G. Wells novel.  The acting by Brad Pitt is terrific and Bruce Willis does a very credible job of playing a confused time traveler.  This is T. Gilliam at his best.  Of course, like most of his other movies, it helps if you are able to appreciate the movie on levels beyond the simple flow of events. I would put this movie on a par with the Matrix in terms of the questions it subtly poses.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|This film (Hostel: Parts I and II) is not a horror film, it is a very thinly veiled political allegory on the essential symbiosis between capitalism and fascism. If it has a flaw, it is that it so pedantically maintains the allegory that some character's motivations strain credibility. Part I leaves the audience with stirrings of revolutionary sympathy. However, it also left the film maker open to claims of mysogyny. Part II is clearly an attempt to correct this impression, as well as neatly drawing the audience into complicity by having it root for the central character's eventual acceptance of ruling-class obligation.     The films might be more honest as documentaries based upon Naomi Klein's \\"The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Distaster Capitalism\\". The thin facade of fictionalism allows apologists and the dim to retain plausible deniability about its true nature, but this is the necessary price of getting it past the corporate censors and of gaining a wide audience.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Okay, maybe there's something out there that can top Firefly.  Maybe.  But the fact remains that this is a truly amazing show, one that was criminally underrated and underwatched during its time on the air and, like so many other good shows that have played on Fox, canceled when it really shouldn't have been.    Now, even if you didn't see the show, you can see what all the fuss is about.    The best things about this show are the characters and the writing.  Joss Whedon's trademark wit shows on every episode - even, amazingly enough, the ones he didn't write.  The dialogue helps you fall for the characters (especially Wash, the uncannily talented pilot and arguably the most loved character of them all), although some of them are just so gosh-darn lovable by themselves that they could say just about anything and still be great (I'm thinking here of Kaylee, the adorable ship's mechanic).    Which is not to say the stories themselves aren't worth watching either.  Not only are they worth watching, they're worth watching over and over.  That's one other amazing thing about this series - after repeated viewings, I'm not even close to tired of this show.  In fact, watching it over and over makes me long for season two - or perhaps a sequel to \\"Serenity,\\" the 2005 Joss Whedon-directed feature film continuation.
B00005JO5L|4.0|I say this movie when it first came out and it gave me the creeps.  This sub-culture of leathermen in leatherbar is truly bizarre and Friedkin captures the atmosphere precisely.    Pacino's performance must have been one of the hardest he had to do since there are so many layers of sexuality and doubt and mystery surrounding his character that to give a convincing portrayal of a possible murderer of gay men must have tested his acting abilities to the limit.  He succeeds.    Since today is World Aids Day - 1 Dec 2007 - I am just wondering how many of the \\"extras\\" are still alive since their performances are so real and convincing.  Were they acting or just being themselves?    A cult classic with a few loose ends and for a very limited audience.  Don't screen it for your mother or grandmother.
0440539811|3.0|This book kind of reminded me of that time I went for a ride on a roller coaster while blindfolded with the safety harness undone.
B000VR824S|5.0|This was great to watch.  So much to see and hear, that I just couldn't get enough.  Jeff Beck was awesome, as was Robbie Robertson, and Steve Winwood blew me away with with his performance of Dear Mr. Fantasy.<br /><br />All around, this DVD set is just great.  No flaws really.  Just wish I'd been there to see this in person!
0440238609|5.0|No doubt about it -- Phillip Pullman is a fairly militant atheist, and these books do, strictly speaking, profess heresy.  Pullman loathes C.S. Lewis, so if you're expecting to find an analog to the Narnia series, read Harry Potter instead.  If I were a fundamentalist Christian, I am sure I would find His Dark Materials very offensive; as a mostly secular Jew, I found the books eyebrow-raising.      However, it's hard to find anyone who doesn't like these books on literary rather than religious grounds.  I can read perfectly well with raised eyebrows, and I was entirely captivated with the thoroughly imagined world and indelible characters Pullman creates.  Lyra is one of the best female characters I've ever encountered, and I really, really want my own armored bear.  Very quickly you come to care passionately about many of the characters.  I remember reading The Subtle Knife on the Stairmaster at the gym, and working out for about an hour and a half because I just couldn't stop reading.  In fact I remember crying during a particularly devastating scene, right there on the Stairmaster at the gym.  Maybe I pretended I was just sweating really hard.      The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife set a standard that Pullman could not sustain in the climax to the series, and The Amber Spyglass is more formulaic and less compelling than the other two.  Still, those two are so good that I have to give the series five stars over all.      A final word: in the Harry Potter vs. Dark Materials debate -- they both win.
B000NA28I4|1.0|Ok, I knew going in that ERAGON was a poorly received film.  I have found that surprisingly often, such poorly reviewed films end up being not half bad.  Unfrotunately, this is not the case here.  ERAGON was every bit as weak as it was criticized for being.    Now, I know nothing about the acclaimed books, so I can't speak to the original story.  But as a film screenplay, this is derivative stuff of the highest order!  Let me describe the plot - farm boy orphan lives with uncle and discovers a secret that a dark ruler in a distant land will kill for - then he realizes he has mystical powers and leads a band of rebels against the army of the dark ruler.  Sound familiar?  It should - its the plot of the original STAR WARS - its the plot of LORD OF THE RINGS!       Now to be fair, as I cited in my title, the hero myth is largely similar in just about every film.  Hero leaves home to go on quest, returns home a different person.  No one expects a REINVENTION of the hero myth - the trick to hero tales is in the nuance and flair with which the writer/director adapts the myth to their own story.  And in the movie ERGAON, there is no flair at all.  It's as if the screenwriters sat down with Campbell's HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES and started the checklist:    \\"OK, main character's a farm boy . . . check . . . farm boys caretaker is killed, leaving him no option to stay home . . . check . . . farm boy has an unrealized gift, in this case, magic . . . check . . . \\"    With the familiar strains of the movie playing from start to finish, I left fully convinced that the sequel will reveal the dark king is really Eragon's father!  SHUDDER!    A derivative story can still be overcome . . . if you have interesting characters.  Sadly, Eragon falls short here as well.  By the twenty minute mark, Eragon is already flying away on his fully formed dragon to start the battle, which means we had no time to learn about him or his people, which means we don't really care about them and theirfate.  We don't even get to know his mentor Obi Wan Ken . . . I mean Brom, who was also once a Jedi Kni . . . I mean Dragon Rider.      All we know is that prior to the movie, Darth Vad . . . I mean Galbatorix, who was a Jedi Kni . . . I mean Dragon Rider himself turned on his fellow Jedi Kn . . . erm, Dragon Riders and killed them all.  But Luke Sky . . . that is, Eragon, receives the plans for the Death Star . . . I mean the Dragon Egg from Princess Leia . . . whoops, I meant Arya, thereby ensuring A NEW HOPE for the Rebellion Forces . . . I mean the Valden.      At any rate, characters come and go throughout, but are never given anything interesting to say about themselves.  Every line of dialogue advances the story, with ZERO room for character growth.  So when we finally reach the climatic battle, I care not one whit about who won.    The only bright spot is the Shade, played quite well by Robert Carlyle.  His brief scenes manage to save the film from being a total loss.    As far as the effects, well, they really are quite excellent.  From flying, to fire, to magic arrow - everything looked pretty flawless.  The final duel between Eragon and the Shade astride their dragons made me forget for the briefest of moments that the film was mostly dragon dung.  Unfortunately, the scene came to its end and all that was left was the obligatory reminder that there is much more story to tell - just wait for ERAGON II - The Empire (oops, I mean King Albatorix) Strikes Back!
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.  Visually stunning, like a graphic novel, with strong character development and epic battle scenes.  I confess that the first time I played the Blu-Ray, it was a little snowy in some closeups, almost pulsating.  The box warns buyers to check for firmware updates to optimize picture quality. I did one firmware update (Samsung BD P1400) and the picture improved.  Since did another one (November), and it got even better.  You'll need an Ethernet cable and about 20 minutes to download the firmware into your machine.  I strongly advise Blu-Ray owners to constantly check their tech support web sites for firmware updates. Clearly, their software is improving monthly.  Otherwise, phenomenal movie!
B00008S2VG|5.0|You say you really like Madonna but you don't have this album?  Waaaaa???<br />Just go buy it already!<br /><br />And to those who don't like the fact that Madonna is growing and evolving and her music is changing alone with her--GET A LIFE YOU PEOPLE!<br /><br />This is one of her best albums ever.  Yes, I have Ray of Light, and this one is just as good if not better.  I thought Ray of Light had a several less than stellar songs, but not this album.  Nothing but hits through and through--at least that's my opinion.<br /><br />Thanks for listening!
B00009W0U4|3.0|This film has undeniable merit which others have described better than I, but I can't resist warning you.... this is extremey rough stuff. I'm hardly a prude, I celebrate both nudity and sexuality in all cinematic shapes and sizes and varieties.... and I don't condemn violence in film if it makes a point or moves along a story or a character's development... and I sincerely applaud directors who aren't afraid to go to the edge.    And I'm an absolute believer in artistic freedom.    But for the first time in my entire life I watched a scene in a film and had the immediate reaction that it should have been censored. Not by a government or by legislation, but at least by common sense. By common decency. What's been referred to as the \\"tunnel sequence\\" is, by a mile, the single most violent scene I've ever witnessed on a screen. In a twisted way it's a credit to the actors and director that the scene is so disturbing because it achieves complete reality, complete believability. But to what end?    We all have our darker tastes and I'll admit to having rented a few exploitation flicks over the years like \\"Hostel II,\\" all the way back to \\"Last House on the Left\\"... but in all these films you're able to say \\"It's only a movie.\\"     The tunnel sequence couldn't be more real if it actually was. And frankly I'm not sure that is wasn't. Don't watch this film unless you're ready to have some deeply, deeply horrifying images (and sounds) branded into your consciousness. This is a film I truly regret having seen.
B0007KTBIU|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it was released in '85. I remember being mildly entertained but annoyed, despite my loose grasp of American history, at the extreme liberties taken with the realities of this true story. No, I was not expecting a documentary from Disney, but a second viewing a few days ago really brought home how non-praiseworthy this film really is.<br /><br />There's a lot to like: love the \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" era animation style. Pochahontas, as a fictional construct, is gorgeous in a very exotic way, and Mel Gibson delivers a very engaging performance as a fictional John Smith. The overly (as usual) anthropomorphized animals were rendered less obnoxious by not speaking English...but then they threw in a talking tree(!). Oh, and despite the fact that I've grown weary of animated musicals, \\"The Colors of the Wind\\" is a fabulous (if tree-huggy) number with beautiful visuals.<br /><br />So what's not to like? Pretty much everything else. The rest of the songs are about on par with the dreck from the Rankin-Bass \\"Hobbit\\". Remember that? Ugh. I know people defend this movie by justifying the historical inaccuracies as \\"art\\" or \\"minor artistic license\\" or whatever, but that demonstrates a deep ignorance that testifies to the shameful state of public education. Another reviewer here used the illustration, by way of comparison, of a supposed film about Anne Frank where she might run off and marry a German soldier. That example carries the right weight, imo. Pochahontas was a little girl when the Jamestown colonists arrived! She was not a statuesque teenager! She may have had some kind of illicit relationship with John Smith later on, but she married somebody else. She was passed around like a novelty back in England and died there. This is not really Disney material, folks.<br /><br />This goes beyond \\"artistic license\\" to completely re-writing the story and replacing historical characters with fantastical constructs that just distract the educated viewer from enjoying a nice little tale. When the writers of \\"The Patriot\\" (another Gibson project) played this loose and fast with history, the historical big wigs eventually pressured them to change the names from actual persons to fictional ones, because the story was no longer really about actual historical people. This one is even worse, and they really should have done the same. This is not a fairy tale, like \\"Little Mermaid\\" (which was also changed dramatically...but who cares? It's just a fable...), and there is a should be a certain amount of responsibility to see that the lives and efforts of those represented are honored.<br /><br />If they just wanted to fill their lineup with a \\"native American\\" story, why not Sacajaweya? Here's a girl who was taken from her people as a child, volunteers or is sold (can't remember) to the Lewis/Clark expedition as a native guide, and ends up finding her own people along the way! Baby Pip grows up and is sponsored by the \\"evil white guys\\" to get a good education and ends up an important guide and Native advocate in the West. Lots of adventure and some seriously happy endings.

When the writers of \\"The Patriot\\" (another Gibson project) played this loose and fast with history, the historical big wigs eventually pressured them to change the names from actual persons to fictional ones, because the story was no longer really about actual historical people. This one is even worse, and they really should have done the same. This is not a fairy tale, like \\"Little Mermaid\\" (which was also changed dramatically...but who cares? It's just a fable...), and there is a should be a certain amount of responsibility to see that the lives and efforts of those represented are honored.    If they just wanted to fill their lineup with a \\"native American\\" story, why not Sacajaweya? Here's a girl who was taken from her people as a child, volunteers or is sold (can't remember) to the Lewis/Clark expedition as a native guide, and ends up finding her own people along the way!

Actually , this movie are recommended for anyone who love to see DVD as a cinetherapy.......and after watching this movie ...let's us say....THIS IS US !!!!!!!
B000Y179KO|2.0|Strip away the tracks that sound like they'd be equally at home on a Backstreet Boys or NSync album (I'm not kidding, there are several here!) or on a Don Henley solo album, or just too darn slick and you're left with a single disc that amounts to... a substandard Eagles album. Don't go looking for a classic Eagles track here; at it's best, what you get is a half-dozen melodic but mediocre songs and a couple of catchy numbers that recall, however faintly, the band's 70s glory days. Maybe Meisner, Felder and Leadon (none of whom are part of the current lineup) contributed more to the Eagles sound than they're given credit for...
0143038419|1.0|Ok, so as my title asks, \\"Why did I even read this?\\"  Well, I will answer that first.  This was my Book Clubs choice, and I couldn't have been more disappointed in the decision.  Quite a few of the members enjoyed this, but I honestly don't understand why.  Sure, Gilbert has qualities that make her feel relatable and down to earth.  But, then again, she has qualities that are annnoying and self-absorbed too.  First of all, we find out that she had this dream to travel to I, I, and I.  But in true fashion, could not afford it.  So what does she do?  She pitches this book to get her publisher to pay for the trip.  Ok, that to me was mistake number 1.  Keep that to yourself!  I would've appreciated the story more if I believed it was really your dream, and not for a book.  Number 2 is that we learn that she recently went through this \\"horrible\\" divorce.  I found no evidence that supported that it was so \\"horrible.\\"  Number 3, she starts to date a guy after the divorce, David, and can't get over him.  Come on, I don't want to hear you reminence about David the entire book.    Personally, it was a struggle to finish the book.  I never felt that she was really on a quest for her own inner happiness, I felt she was on a quest for enough material to write a book.  The premise seemed promising, but in the end, I couldn't care less about her and her journey.  It did absolutely nothing for me.
B000OCY7JE|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but am frustrated at the poor quality production that went into this DVD -- at least in Canada. I went to buy this a few months ago, but an employee at my local video store told me there was a defect on all copies. The audio is out of synch for the last 2 chapters (Scenes 14 and 15) of the film. I was hoping future copies would be fixed. I just checked my newly purchased copy and he was partially right. The audio is delayed by at least 2 seconds, but luckily only in the 5.1 surround sound setting. The more traditional 2.0 stereo audio setting works fine, and the picture and sound are generally great, but this serious failure of production need not have happened.     I'm very disappointed because international and independent films like this get very little attention. Even though this was nominated for an Academy Award for \\"Best Foreign Film,\\" I doubt it will sell millions of copies in North America. It's obvious that a more popular release would have been given greater respect -- either in the careful attention to its initial production or in quickly issuing a recall to fix the problem. This is a huge insult to fans of non-blockbuster films and especially audiophiles.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|Movie arrived just in time for my 12 year son's birthday party.  It was a big hit, along with the spider cake!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I knew the film was fantastic but I didn't realize how great the bonus disc was going to be.  It really provided the background behind the creation of the original play and helped me understand what the playwright was thinking.  Best DVDs I've bought (but honestly, I've only bought a few).
B000VDDES6|4.0|This movie is a must buy. The HD DVD quality is excellent, the transfer is beautiful and the audio is equally impressive. The movie earns 4 stars based on those merits. However there is one thing about this movie that utterly drives me crazy and this bothers me enough to not give this one a perfect 5 star rating.<br /><br />The menu design is lazy and a complete step back to the bare bone DVD days.<br /><br />I expect basic HD DVD functionality with my menu. I want to be able to access the special features from the pop up menu (the menu that appears while the movie is playing) and not have to stop the movie and then go back to the main menu because the pop up menu has omitted this feature (when every other HD DVD has not). Not acceptable.<br /><br />I do expect a visually pleasing main menu with video clips playing under the menu, accompanied by a soundtrack - Like every other HD DVD. A static image with no music does not cut it.<br /><br />This no frills, user not friendly menu is a huge negative. I hope Dreamworks does not tread this water any further. I wrongly assumed a quality standard had been set by the other studios. This is a step in the wrong direction for menu design.
B000000OAN|5.0|Theres no need to argue, simply one of the best rock albums of all human history.
B000H5U832|5.0|This is an extremely cleverly done movie.  Highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.  The writers did a \\"fandango\\" job creating and bringing this movie to life.  We love to watch it and catch or notice new things we've missed watching it previous times.  Another awesome purchase from Amazon.
B0000026J6|5.0|I would classify this album as one of three essential audio works by the great social poet/trubador, Mr. Cohen. The others being \\"The Future\\", and his much older combined works, \\"The Very Best of Leonard Cohen\\".<br />This is quite simply some of the greatest social commentary put to music. Cohen's message is at once both cryptic and poignant, but always engaging.<br />The music is perhaps not as consistently great as that of \\"The Future\\", (not everyone will care for some of the 80's synth work, however it is one of the \\"guilty pleasures\\" I enjoy about this album)yet there is only one weak song (Jazz Police) among the group included here.<br />Personal favorites are  the ominous \\"First We Take Manhattan\\"; the all-time stand-out, \\"Everybody Knows\\", which skewers the state of affairs in our repressed culture; the title track which has plenty of dark comedy infused,; and the slow closer, \\"Tower of Song\\".<br />Lyrical quotes abound, but one of my favorites is from \\"Everybody Knows\\",<br />\\"Everybody knows that the deal is rotten, old black Joe still pickin' cotton, for your ribbons and bows, and everybody knows.\\" True that.<br />Twenty years later, the music may have aged a bit, but the social commentary rings as true now as it ever did.<br />Highly recommended for anyone who likes a little intelligence infused with their music.
1594489505|2.0|Good grief, with all the build up I thought I would not be able to put this book down.  Instead I found myself skimming through to see if anything ever happened.  A few actual historical facts in the book but too few to be interesting.  The few characters in the book were very predictable. I did sense any richness of prose or depth in the story.
B000000OAL|5.0|Queen's debut is quite an outstanding accomplishment.  Usually debut albums point signs of a future successful rock act, however, Queen apparently already KNEW what they wanted their music to be like from the very beginning.  The operatic vocals are here, the amazing and dazzling guitar solos are here, and the unpredictable and unique songwriting talents from the band members is here as well.  It's ALL here, and it's quite possibly the very best Queen album as a result.    I truly enjoy this album.  Most Queen albums had some filler, but not this one.  NO filler anywhere.  \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" is a fast and energetic rocker, clearly influenced by the glam rock movement going on at the time.  \\"Doing All Right\\" is our first chance to listen to a singer with a gifted voice through an amazing ballad.  \\"Great King Rat\\" has a somewhat childish vocal melody in spots, but made up for with a fantastic guitar riff and a dazzling display of solos.  \\"My Fairy King\\" is a completely unique song.  It seriously defines the word \\"unique\\" because I've never heard anything like it, especially from a rock band.  It sounds like it may have been influenced by one of the big progressive rock bands such as Yes and Genesis, but with Queen's own distinct vocal style.     \\"Liar\\" is similar to Rush's \\"Working Man\\", Black Sabbath's \\"Iron Man\\", Deep Purple's \\"Highway Star\\" and UFO's \\"Rock Bottom\\" in terms of guitar wizardry.  Sure, there's a catchy \\"LIAR\\" chant going on throughout the song, but the guitar workout is the main thing.  \\"The Night Comes Down\\" is another vocal melody display of brilliance, \\"Modern Times Rock 'n' Roll\\" is short, but VERY heavy (almost heavy metal), \\"Son and Daughter\\" is almost blues rock, \\"Jesus\\" has a beautiful chorus and nice lyrics, and \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\" is about one minute long, and features even more excellent guitar playing.  Maybe a classic album.
0440238609|3.0|In spite of lovely writing and interesting characters, I think this trilogy does not match the excitement and color of the Harry Potter series. Pullman is a great writer, but he is lacking in JK Rowling's special gifts of humor, excellent secondary characters, and roller-coaster plotting.    In fact, Pullman's plotting is plodding. The third book was, for me, about 100 pages too long.     I don't believe this is a dangerous book for young people, but perhaps most who have limited time for reading will pick something else. Pullman's criticisms of organized religion ring a bell at times, but the pathetic creature who is killed in book 3 definitely is not most people's idea of God the Father, Son or Holy Spirit.
B000PKG7TI|4.0|A supremely enjoyable concert DVD for Nightwish fans and newbies alike. In particular their cover of \\"High Hopes\\" off of \\"Division Bell\\" is outstanding. The content of the DVD would've easily warranted five stars, but the occasionally hyperactive editing and cheap gimmicks as well as having a disc full of widescreen material, yet delivered in non-anamorphic letter box format detracts from the enjoyment. Also be sure to turn on 5.1 audio, as the disc plays as two channel audio by default. The documentary on the disc isn't particularly interesting, basically just being a whole lot of backstage footage that shows the atmosphere rather than imparting any insights into the band or members.
B000UFAURI|5.0|The Foo Fighters are a great band and they prove with this one that they can be slightly soothing. This album is much more mellow than what you would expect from them, but it's still an awesome CD. I love the single, which was put as the first track, but I recommend listening past it and getting through the whole thing. Tons of great guitar handiwork that really shows off these guys as not only a great band, but great musicians as well. Love it!
B000TGJ8IU|1.0|A last-ditch attempt by Warner Bros. to squeeze a few more pennies out of an epic disappointment...and just when I had forgotten the butchery Wolftgang Peterson and his gang of Hollywood henchmen did to the Iliad. Even dressed over again, this film is a study in how to destroy a great story.
B000GTJT16|4.0|Over all I like the movie and think it a great watch! The hd version has fantastic sound couple that with the good story and you have a good product! The  transfer to hd picture is where I was a little disappointed,  I am  a big fan of hd  and love all the detail and clarity it brings to movies(*The Searchers hd-dvd) but this one didn't achieve anything better than the sd version , as I said I like the movie and the sound is great on a good system but I would not recommend this as your first leap into hd!!!! a good addition to the collection but it will not be or set a visual standard!
B000LXH0AE|5.0|This is one of my favorite DVD releases of 2007.  While I love kooky Will Ferrell movies, this is a pleasant change.    The script is smart, original, funny and touching.  Everyone delivers outstanding performances.  I even like Maggie Gyllenhall.  This movie is great and highly underrated.
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|Cry Baby is a fun look at 50's Baltimore and a great parody/tribute to the Elvis films.  The characters are great and fun.  Depp is solid in his character and singing and of course, hot.  It was a great step away from 21 Jump Street for him.  Just lots of good silliness and fun.  It may not be Hairspray or Serial Mom but it definitely holds its own.  I am glad to have it as part of my DVD as well as John Waters library.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|This is a great film.  It is visually interesting.  The DVD extras discussion of the filming of this movie is very interesting.  What I enjoyed, and was surprised by, most is that this ended up being a story about Clive Owens' character, not just a tale of science fiction.  It ended up being a lovely and touching film that emerged through the darkness of the story.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|For all those who love the PBS English Drama and Mysteries, this is a winner.  You know the guy is going to get the gal in the end, but the Victoria style suspense is entertaining.  Richard Armitage is a favourite of mine (plays a great villain as Guy of Gisburn in the latest Robin Hood series).    The drama starts in the beautifully serene Cornwall, soon to be replaced by the gloom and doom of a mill town in Yorkshire.  The mills were harsh and unlovely, as were the conditions.   Very diverting and worth adding to the collection of PBS offerings.
B0000027RL|5.0|As you probably can tell by the rating, this is an amazing CD. My opinion is that it's Pearl Jam's finest, if you don't like that style of music, fine, I won't review a gansta rap album or salsa album, because that's not my style.    This CD hosts probably the 2 most popular songs by the band (Alive and Black, songs that you can't hear Eddie sing while live cause everyone sings along)    If you like Pearl Jam, or early 90s rock, then this is the number one album to buy,
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I purchased this record via iTunes on May 5th of 2007. I went for one of my lengthy bike rides and brought the iPod along to listen to this record on the same day. I didn't find anything offensive about it upon the initial listen. I will give Messrs. Weinrib, Zivojinovich and Peart credit for being able to bring a certain degree of rock at their age. BUT...........................there is a triteness to the lyrics. Witness \\"No one gets to heaven without a fight\\"...\\"...spirit...strong...flesh is too weak\\"......yeah, Neil. yadda yadda yadda. We all know that crap.    Basically my reaction to and evaluation of this record is \\"So wart?\\"
0783240236|3.0|What a great conceit to use birds in a horror film. The potential for looming danger is ever present. On crowded urban streets people are always ducking, flinching reactively when a pigeon swoops low. Of course they never get hit - but they could. And you can imagine how unpleasant it would be to be attacked by birds - nasty, feathered guerrilla attackers, all up close pecking and sharp pinching and cutting of the skin. Bloody, and not pleasant.<br /><br />Hitchcock deploys the bird theme to magnificent sci-fi effect in this movie.  Melanie Daniels pursues caddish bachelor Mitch in Bodega Bay, a small Northern Californian community. Flitting across the bay after secretly delivering some lovebirds to him, she is swooped on by a gull and pecked. Then attacks by various species of birds grow, ever stronger, more mysteriously and more dangerously. Lives are endangered, people are terrified, the homely superstitious residents of Bodega Bay look to the mysteriously icy blonde Melanie Daniels and wonder what she is doing here, and why did the attacks start when she came to town?<br /><br />This film does not end with clean, satisfactory meanings or resolutions. There are several symbolic motifs that could be explained in a number of ways. Lydia, Mitch's mother, in a way is the most curious character in the film, her role seems to parallel the bird attacks in many aspects - her hawk like suspicions, her careful guarding of Mitch and attacks on people who try to get close to him like the tragic Annie Heyworth. The famous last scene features birds rippling and gathering ominously, but they do not attack.<br /><br />What happens? Melanie seems to have been subdued, her haughty arrogance and self confidence blown away. Is she a better person? Why the bird attacks? Will they continue? This is a movie that gets under the skin, and poses more uncomfortable questions than it answers.
B000WQW988|5.0|Get this DVD now!  The quality (to me) is amazing.  The extras of the band rehearsing is so awesome and watching it over and over reminds me how much i love and miss them.  There's a behind the scenes interview of people who were there and the kid in the hat was pretty dull.  Wish they would have interviewed the guy from Sonic Youth, or something/someone more interesting; even Dave or Krist (probably impossible).  Still waiting all these years was worth it.  The extra songs and the banter between songs are priceless and I'm so happy there was an opportunity and now a DVD that captured Kurt's amazing talent.
B00006F1IJ|5.0|Ordered this recently with a gold box deal, and it became an immediate favorite in my household. My 20 & 14 yr. old sons LOVE it! So does their mom! A great collection of music from Acoustic Alchemy. What can I say? We all  love acoustic guitar and this is some of the best of the best. Highly recommend for personal enjoyment or as an affordable treat for someone else.

B000RIWAVW|1.0|Do not waste your time purchasing this unless you want an inferior version! The divimax version is far superior to this. It is slightly more expensive though, so unless you don't care about owning the best possible version available on DVD then this version should be an option.<br /><br />This has been about the sixth time Anchor Bay has released this movie, and the same amount of times that I've purchased it. I've never been disappointed with the new version they put out, until now! As soon as I started watching it I realized it was very inferior to the version I've been watching the last couple of years - the Divimax version.<br /><br />So leave it up to what your DVD standards are and purchase this version to save some $ and get a decent looking version, or buy the [[ASIN:B00009UW0N Halloween (Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition)]] and own a great quality DVD with plenty of features!<br /><br />J
B00005MP58|5.0|Both me and my husband thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  My husband isn't into \\"chick flicks\\" or \\"classic romances\\" so he was sure he would not enjoy this one, but he liked it as much as I did. I am looking forward to watching it again soon.
6305308659|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. I have probably seen it about 15 times and every time, without fail, I discover new symbolism in the movie. So many themes overlap, as they do in life. This movie is absolutely amazing. If I could sum up my interpretation of this in only a few words I would say, the spiritual evolution of mankind.
B000Y179KO|2.0|A lesser band may have gotten 3 stars but after 28 years with legendary status, you have to do better than this. The first CD bores me to sleep and reduces the impact and quality of the second. It is pitifully and painfully slow and boring. Why they forced it on us is surprising. A single album of just the second disc would have been a much better direction.    The first disc should have been marketed by itself as a super mellow ballad CD or something. Don't expect anything resembling Eagles rock and roll on disc one. It will put you to sleep if you do. I can't sit through the whole thing. Its just a huge disappointment and is for the die hard Eagles fan who is determined to like anything they do no matter how lacking.    The second CD is much better but just doesn't express the freedom I used to hear and feel from the old great recordings. The Joe Walsh Last Good Time in Town is very good but who's artistic idea was it to have the whispered chorus of \\"hang up the phone\\" and \\"play jazz on trombone\\" crap? It sounds silly. Not cool but just silly. It almost sounds like they over thought some of these songs and lost some spontaneity. Just my opinion.    But there are a few pretty good cuts on the second CD and will be worth having. This double CD is not going to make any kind of music history. It's just rather uninspired.
0810993139|5.0|My son read this book in two days. For a reluctant reader such as himself, this was quite an accomplishment! The book is hilariously funny, and with the combination of writing and cartoons it's sure to be a hit -- especially with boys.
0767817664|5.0|Poor Charlie Brewster. a vampire has just moved into the big, spooky old house next door, Charlie begs everyone around him to take action before the Vampire claims him as his next victim.

B00005OMTT|5.0|I see most fans of bands and singers as generally fitting into one of two categories: hardcore or casual.<br /><br />Hardcore fans seem to have been divided by this album. Some like the new twists on old favorites while others have condemned the changes. Still others think something's missing or something SHOULD be missing.<br /><br />Luckily I've avoided all that by being a casual fan of Enigma. For me, this album couldn't be better.<br /><br />All of my favorite songs are represented here, as well as one or two I had not heard before. The songs generally flow freely from one track to the other. It takes me on a wonderful emotional journey no matter how many times I listen to it. The album makes for wonderful background music as well.<br /><br />The bottom line is if you are a hardcore fan, try it. If you are a casual fan, buy it. You won't be disappointed by this great addition to your collection.
0780626494|5.0|We probably won't be compatible if you don't like this movie, The Big Lebowski and the Princess Bride.  One of my first date questions, actually ;-)<br /><br />Sure, it helped to have such wonderful actors, but this dude has come up with 3 (that I know of) stories that as different as they are from one another, are incredibly interesting and \\"fresh\\".  I think a great deal of his work.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I owned all of the previous Enigma CDs and have been a big fan since the beginning.  I almost didn't buy this one based on the mixed reviews here at Amazon.  I'm glad I decided to give it a change though.  While Enigma's music has evolved, the haunting beats, the transcendental nature of their music and the emotions it evokes remains constant.<br /><br />This albums fits nicely into my collection being different enough to justify another purchase of Enigma, but not so different that it loses that Enigma feel.
0786852550|5.0|The Amulet of Samarkland is a very fun,dark(yes,they can go together) fantasy. Batimaeus does, responding to another review, really makes the book, with a witty,sarcastic humor that appeals to me. He also is a surprisingly deep character (heck,they all are), and manages to break the old \\"demon=pure evil\\" plotline. Very good for teens,intelligent kids, and aduts, all who like fantasy, but thought that Harry Potter could have used a few jokes and an anti-villain.
0060558121|4.0|What happens to gods when their followers lose interest and eventually forget them? In this work of urban fantasy Neil Gaiman explores this idea, introducing the reader to Shadow, a man recently released from prison and who has learned his wife has just died. Beginning life again essentially from scratch, he agrees to begin working for a man named Wednesday. Wednesday is preparing for a coming battle between the ancient, traditional gods (himself, Anansi, Easter, Czernobog and Ibis, among others) who have been forgotten in favor of the new \\"gods\\" of the modern, industrialized world (technology, cities, etc.).<br /><br />As the reader, I wanted to know a little more about the characters (the gods) and their stories and motivations. This was my first Gaiman experience and, while I highly enjoyed his writing style, I wasn't completely in love with the story. I'd definitely read another of his works.
3822856282|5.0|This exploration women of photographing themselves is beautiful and inspiring.  The journal of the young woman who started the project is alluring and criminally erotic.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Four boys go on an overnight hike to look for the body of a child who is rumored to have been hit by a train.  Two of them (Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix) are mature and self-aware, while the other two (Jerry O'Connell and Corey Feldman) are still extremely juvenile and will probably always be so.  The result is an affecting tale of how the macabre and menacing can intrude on childhood innocence, evoking the bittersweet moment when one knows that the magic of childhood is fading and adulthood looms ahead.  This touching film, based on a novella by Stephen King, brilliantly sums up its themes with one of the best final lines in the movies.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|...done just about everything right.  I have seen few films that were more inspirational, heartfelt, and honest than this Irish gem.    Boy meets girl (or, rather, girl seeks out boy); boy warms to girl; boy and girl make beautiful music together (literally), but boy and girl have complicating factors in their lives; boy and girl head in separate directions, but emotionally on the same page; and it all somehow involves a Hoover, a piano, and copious quanitities of great music.    I've spent the summer recommending it to my family and friends.  You'll do the same once you've seen Once.
0345494997|5.0|what fun! A well-imagined story. If you have visited Taliesen or are simply a Frank Lloyd Wright fan I think you will enjoy this romp.
0954510364|5.0|Treasure Island is perhaps THE classic pirate's tale. Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, created a rich story of adventure and treachery on the high seas all seen through the eyes of a boy named Jim Hawkins. Jim starts off as the son of tavern owners in a humble little port village. When an old seaman stays at the tavern, trouble soon follows him in the form of a pirate crew seeking revenge. I will not give away any more specific plot points, but events move forward to a great treasure hunt, treachery, and a surprisingly engaging story for adults as well as children.     Jim Hawkins is the hero of the story and he's a good lad with a stout heart. Long John Silver is the real star, however, and his character is a fascinating character study in moral ambiguity... or perhaps a study in amoral perfection. The pirate language is good and thick but this edition has plenty of notes to help you decipher some of the references that have become too obscure for today's readers. The plot moves along very briskly with no wasted scenes.     In short, Treasure Island well deserves its status as a beloved classic. It's a story of suspense and adventure that can be enjoyed at a child's level, but has substance for adults as well. I would recommend without reserve it to virtually anyone.
0062515675|3.0|This novel is a light and easy read, with a writing style at about a 6th grade level.    There is not much in the way of a plot, and the story is the interaction between a high profile trial lawyer and his protoge.  You would expect this pair to not only be highly intelligent, but highly articulate as well.  The simple and trite dialog between the two just did not seem realistic to me.  The story and it's characters seemed shallow.    In terms of enlightenment the book presents 7 steps to live a wonderful life.  I found the parable given to be silly, but the 7 steps are good stuff.  They came off as lacking depth to me though, probably because the story was not good enough to draw me in.    Entertainment: 2 stars  Enlightenment: 4 stars
B00000JRTX|5.0|Four Weddings and a Funeral follows Charles (Hugh Grant) and friends through a period of time in which they attend, um, four weddings and one funeral. Most of the movie actually occurs at these ceremonies so the film is aptly named all around. Charles meets Carrie (Andie MacDowell) at wedding number one and a good portion of the movie revolves around whether these two will end up together or not. There are various subplots involving four of his friends as well as his brother, most of them involving romance of some sort.     This is the movie that made Hugh Grant a star and it's easy to see why. He plays his stuttering nice guy to perfection and is helped by a script that any actor would gladly kill for. Andie MacDowell plays a terrific counterbalance with her mellow charm. The entire cast of largely unknown (in the U.S. at least) British actors does a fantastic job of infusing the film with warmth and life. Another plus is that this is the rare movie where the cast looks like real people instead of supermodels. It helps ground the film and make the characters seem more real.     This deluxe edition DVD is a nice presentation. The picture has been cleaned up and converted to anamorphic format, the sound is crisp and there are some nice \\"making of\\" documentaries. Finally, there is a commentary track for those interested in that sort of thing. All in all, it's a nice package and worth a few extra dollars to get.     In summary, Four Weddings is a great movie. The humor is quirky, though, and probably not for everyone. For anyone willing to take a chance on something different, however, this is a true keeper. It was an instant classic when it was released and remains one to this day.
B000GFLKEY|4.0|Inside Man is a cleverly made and action packed movie.  Different plot twists make it a smarter than normal heist movie.  It was cool to see Denzel Washington play his role smoothly, yet powerfully.  Plus, the behind-the-scenes workings of Jodie Foster provide a sinister, politically thought provoking dimension.<br /><br />Pleasantly surprised.  Definitely recommend it.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|Unfortunately, I never saw this movie as a kid. I would have loved it. But seeing it for the first time in my twenties, despite some bad acting and cheesy dialogue, the film was thoroughly enjoyable. The visual graphics in the film are amazing. The colors and otherworldliness really take you into another place.<br /><br />Not only is the film completely over the top, it's actually a pretty decent take on totalitarianism and the nature of dictators. By inspiring fear into the hearts of his subjects, Ming is able to \\"divide and conquer\\". The people are so afraid of Ming that they will sell each other out for his favor. But Flash Gordon, through his conscience and humanity, is able to bring them together to topple the psychopathic Ming.<br /><br />Pure fun!<br /><br />Oh, and the Queen soundtrack is worth the price alone.
B000ZN8036|5.0|This is an outstanding film chronicling Christopher McCandless' (Emile Hirsch) two year, roundabout, journey to the Alaskan wilderness.  On the surface, the journey appears self-destructive, thus, in every encounter he is forced to explain his purpose to otherwise skeptical observers.<br /><br />In doing so, he not only finds the purpose for his journey but the purpose for his frustratingly confusing life.  Once he finally figures it all out, his death becomes all the more tragic because he is unable to either share or apply his new, enlightened perspective.<br /><br />Along the way, he is both teacher and student.  His bold search for personal truth inspires others to do the same.  He ignites their previously unexamined lives, and they revere him for it.  He also soaks in valuable wisdom from others along the way.<br /><br />By observing McCandless' search for meaning, the viewer can't help but ask himself the same existential questions.  Thus, the film's value lies in its ability to evoke the same questions in the audience as it did in the characters McCandless meets along the way.<br /><br />Outstanding cinematography and a beautiful soundtrack further add to this fine film.  Highly recommend.
B000E33VWW|5.0|As a friend of mine said after seeing Capote, \\"That movie was ALL Philip Seymour Hoffman!\\" All the acting is great, but Hoffman carries the film. It's probably the best performance of his career.<br /><br />That being said, the script is great, the cinematography is stunning, and the characters evoke pathos. A really moving film.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's 'Magic' is one of the finer albums made in recent years.  For some audiophiles and purists, this may cause the need to criticize the style, studio production, or songwriting.  There are also those who complain because they either have nothing better to do or cannot consider the artist because of his political leanings.  That is their right, but that does not mean the criticism is deserved when one hates the man without even considering the artistic output.    Magic marks an excellent return by the E. Street Band.  Brendan O'Brien's production fleshes out the sonics, which returns Springsteen and the band to their signature sound.  People have compared this to Born in the U.S.A., which is not without merit, but this album is more closely related to The River, in both style and sound.    There are many similarities between the songwriting here and Springsteen's work of the past.  However, many of the familiarities are connected to songs that were not released on proper albums.  \\"Radio Nowhere\\" recalls \\"Restless Nights\\" and the unreleased \\"Night Fire.\\"  \\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\" reminds one of \\"None But the Brave.\\" \\"Living in the Future\\" is a descendent of \\"Hungry Heart\\" and 10th Avenue Freezeout.\\" The title track is in the same style as more recent works such as \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\" and \\"Paradise.\\" \\"Last to Die\\" follows \\"Roulette\\" and \\"Further On (Up the Road.\\"  Finally, \\"Long Walk Home\\" is reminiscent of \\"My Hometown\\" and \\"The Rising.\\"    These connections bring with them a familiarity, and yet something new.  \\"Long Walk Home\\" connects the rock of \\"the Rising\\" with the lyrical maturity and storytelling of earlier albums.  \\"You'll Be Coming Down\\" is pure pop at it's best.  \\"Last to Die\\" is one of his best rock songs in ages, along with \\"Radio Nowhere,\\" and \\"Living in the Future\\" and \\"Devil's Arcade\\" as as good as anything he's done in recent years.    There are no real weakpoints on this album.  There are occasional slipups, such as a weak hook inthe otherwise stellar \\"Work for Your Love,\\" but otherwise this album is as good of a rock and roll production as it gets from an artist approaching 60 years old.
0060853980|5.0|This is the only book I've bought 4 times.  It is so good, that I loan it to people and never get it back, and I have to replace it.  What makes it so good is that people from all demographics have read and enjoyed this book.  It's tone and reflection on what it is to be human are enough to let you laugh while all the while thinking \\"I know someone who would do just that, and it might be me.\\"      I love both Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman for very different reasons, but it is clear that their friendship and collaboration pay off for anyone who reads this book.      I think I need to go read it again...
B000UX6THK|4.0|To really get all extras you need the original Artisan S1 release, and the Paramount S2 release.      This set has some real nice extras, but isn't really a definitive set.
B000VI70WM|4.0|Probably \\"Astronaut\\" was more compact, but less dangerous and experimental. This disc can compete in innovation with \\"Big thing\\" or \\"Medazzaland\\".
B00005JPCF|4.0|Generally, i don't watch much kid-driven animation. Generally, I don't stop while channel surfing HBO to watch what is basically a musical with drawings.  But this time, I was lucky.  I stopped my HBO flipping, captured by the beauty of the images and ended up staying for them and the story.       The story is simple (see synopsis) yet the characters are so engaging that you find yourself captivated anyway.  The animation literally causes to stop breathing, in anticipation and delight.  And the voice acting...i really can't stand Nicole Kidman, but as Mumble's Momma, I loved her. The music?  I found myself dancing in my living room with my roomate, both of us too overjoyed to be chagrined at our child-like behavior.        Now I like all kinds of movies with dark story lines and tangled messages.  I am not easily pleased.  But this movie is exactly the type of thing to pop in when your own life is just too full of darkness, without being over-simplified or too pat. So-if you just are too emotionally exhausted to pop in \\"The Life Aquatic\\" or \\"Donnie Darko\\" put this movie in.  If \\"Requiem For a Dream\\" is just too much for you, let Mumble and his family remind you that even in the worst times, there are always reasons to dance.
B000YABV90|5.0|11-year-old Evan wants nothing more in life than to find his parents, or for them to find him. Labeled a freak by his fellow boys home residents it isn't long before he finds himself on the streets of New York in search of the mother and father he never knew. Like a fish out of water, the sights and sounds of the city that never sleeps are at once overwhelming and intoxicating. In every thumping foot, squealing tire, barking dog and rattling chain he hears a rhythm. Music. Harmonics no one hears but him. He knows if he just follows the music somehow his parents will find him. What he doesn't know is that his parents have no idea he exists.<br /><br />Ten years ago his mother, Lyla (Keri Russell), a gifted celoist, was a young prodigy herself when she met Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), the talented lead singer and guitarist for an Irish rock band. Immediately they share a bond, and their night together changes everything. Can the power of music bring this family of strangers back together again?<br /><br />Don't let the somewhat un-inspiring title August Rush fool you. This movie is a heart-warming film with a rich narrative, visually diverse settings, and a lush original music score. Freddie Highmore's spot-on performance as Evan, who soon takes up the moniker August Rush, immediately invokes our sympathy. We truly care what happens to this bright-eyed, innocent boy who hasn't let himself become jaded by his harsh environment. (If he looks familiar it's probably because of his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Finding Neverland fame. He played the lead child roles in both.)<br /><br />But it's not just Highmore who carries this movie. Every actor nails their role beautifully. Keri Russell (perhaps known best for the TV show Felicity) is a natural on the screen, skillfully bringing to life the character of Lyla both as a naive young woman and a passionate mother. Robin Williams' supporting role as a music pimp to a brood of unwanted yet musically gifted children cinches that he can play the deeper roles right alongside his lighter comedy ones. You'll also want to take notice of Terrence Howard's performance as social worker Richard Jeffries, a man in the system who genuinely cares for the kids under his care but often finds his hands frustratingly tied.<br /><br />A few times suspension of disbelief is called for as August Rush is more about the fantastic than the realistic. It's a little hard to believe Evan is able to play both the guitar and organ like a master (not to mention conduct an orchestra) without ever having seen or touched the instruments before in his life. But you really don't mind. This movie has enough heart to carry it above and beyond those moments. Its portrayal of music's magic, that powerful tug on the human heart and soul, sets it apart from your average film tackling the same subjects.<br /><br />Parents will appreciate the filmmaker's tact in portraying Lyla and Louis' one-night stand. No more than the beginnings of a passionate kiss are shown. A few swear words (h-- and d--) probably aren't appropriate for youngsters since several are uttered by children, but they really did have their place in showing you the hard existence of some of the street kids.<br /><br />August Rush reminds us that amidst the hardships there truly is some good left in this world. You'll come away from this movie with a greater appreciation of music's power, not to mention the power of love and family. Definitely worth seeing more than once.<br /><br />--Reviewed by C.J.

B000NOQDOA|5.0|I installed this in my 2007 Odyssey and it's solid. The car interior looks nice and clean. My $50 Wal-mart(Venturer) dvd player and my Sony DVPFX810 both fits perfectly.    The only drawback is that it's semi-permanently installed, meaning the thieves will see the mount installed behind your headrest(unless you want to unscrew the allen bolts each time you park).
B000VMBXNA|5.0|Others have summarized the plot nicely.  This is not the type of book I would normally be drawn to, but Bennett writes a humorous and interesting tale.  The book makes one think about their own reasons for reading, and how reading affects our lives.  I've suffered many of the same regrets about reading, and wasted time, as Bennett brings to life in his book. Read it and enjoy it.
B0002JJBZY|4.0|I won't go into how great watching the original series.  Yes, I know it is cheezy, often lame melodramatic, scifi schlock...but watching these episodes with the kids, hearing the music, Shatner's portrayal of James T. Kirk, the special effects... now, my kids truly get and appreciate the popular culture \\"in jokes\\" related to this series.  It just fun to watch.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars but... the packaging drives me crazy but it was priced well and I got a good deal through the Amazon marktetplace  A great value.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Wow! This show is just a blast to watch. Maybe you just gotta be a certain type of geek to appreciate these kinds of fantastical good-vs-evil-premised comic-book-type shows (yes I'm also a big fan of Smallville and several of the CW's other fantasy shows).     The Amazon editorial is funny, with it's comparisons, cause I usually describe this show to people as an \\"X-files version of Charmed\\", since it's these two regular guys hunting down demons and evil spirits instead of aliens, in a more dramatized and haunting fashion than \\"the Charmed ones\\" do.     Of course, being a 20-something American female, my personal 5-star justification would be incomplete if I left out that Jensen Ackles and his character have completely knocked me off my feet... but I digress...
B000B8QEZG|3.0|This is one of Madonna's most unique albums. She's reinvented herself yet again. And this time she's introduced a new sound that we've never heard on previous Madonna records. It sounds like a mix of 70's disco and techno/trance. After listening to the album several times from beginning to end, I've formed mixed feelings about it. The songs blend together after a while. And instead of hearing 12 separate tracks, it sounds like one long, drawn out song--sometimes creating overkill. However the album has a few stand out numbers that make the record more enjoyable. My favorites are--    1. Jump  2. Get Together  3. Sorry  4. Forbidden Love  5. Let it Will Be    It's definitely unlike anything out in stores today, but the album tends to deliver too much of a good thing--which makes it a little unbearable at times. Nevertheless, it's still worth a listen. 3 1/2 stars!
0385474547|5.0|Native of Nigeria, Africa, Chinua Achebe wrote his own masterpiece fictional novel entitled \\"Things Fall Apart,\\" which took place in his own country during the 19th century. Achebe has used his own background of an African village to create an interesting story that gives unique perspective of the African life and culture. The book is broken into three parts which describe the main character, Okonkwo, and the lifestyle in his village, the arrival of the missionaries and their actions toward the villagers, and the last year of Okonkwo's life.<br /><br />The first part of \\"Things Fall Apart\\" expresses the lifestyle of the African culture in the village of Umuofia where the main character, Okonkwo, had lived. This first part consists of thirteen chapters that reveal the life in Umuofia, the wives and children of Okonkwo, the life and death of Ikemefuna, and the beginning of Okonkwo's exile. The second part of this book focuses on the life of the exile in Mbanta, the village of Okonkwo's mother. It consists of six chapters which reveal Okonkwo and his family living with his mother's kinsmen in Mbanta, the visits from Obierika, the arrival of the missionaries, the conversion of Okonkwo's son, Nwoye, and the last year of Okonkwo's exile. The final part of the novel expresses the actions of the missionaries, the return of Okonkwo to Umuofia, and the death of Okonkwo. It consists of six chapters that reveal Okonkwo's attempts to urge the villagers to fight against the missionaries after his return, Mr. James' attempt to change the belief of the villagers, and a certain death of the villager.<br /><br />There is great deal of symbolism and meanings being expressed from this unique novel, and it also expresses a fascinating perspective about African life and the impact of cultural imperialism.<br /><br />The novel is quite enjoyable to read and gives one a food for thought.

King Kong was a great character: He was humorous, smart, silly, and very caring.<br /><br />As far as the story goes though, King Kong loved the dame in this and fell in love with picking her up after a fall to knock her down over and over again. That was the funniest part in the movie! :^)<br /><br />The actors did a fairly decent job of bringing the characters to live and the action kept you glued but you won't wanna watch this one over and over again.<br /><br />The action is mostly in the jungle where all of these sick creatures live and call it home.<br /><br />Cover Art: B-<br />Story: C+<br />Dialogue: C+<br />Characters: B-<br />Length: C-<br />Overall: C

0743270754|5.0|While I might be presumptuous as well being review number 3,000 or so - I have to comment on this book.  It is one of the longest I have read in recent memory, maybe ever - 754 pages, but is one of the absolute best.  Every single page of this book is worth it.  While my wife joked while I was reading it, \\"How is it going to end?\\" I have to say - there are so many twists and turns to the story that I almost started to wonder.  This reads as well as any book I've read - but I should confess I'm a big nonfiction fan.    There's a quote in the front of the book from Leo Tolstoy who says that \\"Lincoln is greater than all the other Presidents combined...\\"  I am paraphrasing, but if you read this book you'll find out why.  He certainly had flaws (I don't understand why he didn't drink) but reading this book gives you an appreciation of what a fabulous human being he really was - and I should say something to strive for.  His sagacity, compassion, strength, patience - are all shown here.  Other men and women of great strength might have been crushed by the burdens and hardships placed upon him - one being that he lost his son Willie in the middle of the war to typhoid.      Other reviews have said this book is like hanging out with Lincoln.  I couldn't agree more.  Every time I pick it up it is like I am taken back to the time and place of these people and events.    It has been said that the only person who has had more books written about him than Abe Lincoln is Jesus Christ.  If you read this book, you'll find out why.  It is a great book for most anyone - for managers who want to learn how to manage corporate politics or employees, for students of history who want to see how strong presidents manage and what really happened around Gettysburg, or just for anyone who is looking for the best in the human race.  This is a wonderful book.  Great job Doris.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|My reaction probably wasn't typical, but by the time the CD got to \\"I f**k*ng hate you\\" I couldn't help but burst out laughing.<br /><br />The profanity is so over the top that it's a cartoon. It is Billy Idol's scowl. It is the backbeat of Queen. It's effing funny and worth the price as a parody if nothing else.<br /><br />But when the laughter fades, the listener is amazed at the talent that shows in the music. They harmonize in several vocals. Harmonies done in the same manner as the Lennon Sisters, if they had a drumbeat and electric guitar riffs. It's good stuff. Don't dismiss it lightly.
0765357151|5.0|In \\"I Am Legend\\" (which is a short novel at best) Robert Neville finds himself the only \\"human\\" in existence. By day he barricades his house with garlic and crosses and searches the barren city in his car looking for food, gasoline and other necessary things to survive. By night, he hears vampires call his name and he can see them as they try desperately to figure out how to get to him.<br /><br />The tension in the book is amazing. Matheson builds up the plot layer by layer and it is clear that Neville's time is running out. Still, Matheson gives you hope that maybe Robert Neville will find other humans or animals that can at least help him try to survive the emotional turmoil and fear that he lives with knowing the vampires want him dead.<br /><br />There are other short stories with this edition and all of them are excellent, but \\"I Am Legend\\" is an incredible vampire story and worth every second of your time to read and see the genius that is Robert Matheson.

0307346617|5.0|Stephen Ambrose meets George Romero in Max Gibson's fun, and fascinating oral history of the Zombie wars. Brooks' narrator tracks down participants big and small across the globe. No punches are pulled, Chinese government officials and medical staff present at the initial outbreak, heroes and incompetents, war profiteers, victims and reactionaries.

B000ETRCMQ|5.0|This film will surprise you with its honest, direct, engaging, heart-felt story. The script is clever and well written. The acting is superb and Felicity Huffman could not have done better. Hopefully the super job she did playing the transgender Bree will provide her with more opportunities to reveal her considerable talents. Kevin Zegers deserves praise for the excellent performance as Toby, Bree's son. It is highly recommended entertainment.     Underneath the compelling storyline, there is an exploration of the concept of identity that is a great strength of the film. Bree was once a man named Stanley, reared in an upper middle-class home in Phoenix with a controlling Irish-Catholic mother and quite but supportive Jewish father. After ten years of college without ever getting a degree, Stanley flounders around in phone marketing and as Bree works in a Mexican restaurant as a waitress as part of the gender re-assignment process. But Bree is going into surgery thinking that this is the answer to her transgender sexual identity but also without regard to reconciling the past so that she moves toward the future with no burdens from her past clinging to her psychological well-being. This is the gift of the phone call from her son, locked up in NYC for street hustling. It is the reconciliation adventures with her son that eventually leads to the reconciliation with her parents and with herself.     The character of Toby is equally complex in that he is a child that has been abandoned by his natural mother through her suicide and that has been sexually molested by his step-father until he runs away from home to escape the sexual abuse. A very painful and touching scene in the film is when Toby, finally grateful for the physical protection and parental disciplinary limits that Bree offers, offers the one thing he feels he has to offer, which is his body, to Bree. She realizes that his perception of her must be based on more honest information and she reveals that she isToby's father.     Bree has thought that the day after her sexual reassignment surgery would be the best day of her life, and yet when that day comes she cries with her therapist. She cries because whereas her body has now changed, she is unfulfilled as a parent, a role that she began to adopt in her journey across the USA with Toby. The film is reconciled around this issue rather than around the issue of sexual-reassignment. Toby needs a parent and he senses this and Bree has awakened not only to her new sexual identity role but also to her role as a parent, one that will greatly enhance her growth and fulfillment in life.     It is the basic human fulfillment needs of all human beings that is the under grid of this excellent film, which has been made very entertaining by the less than typical story line and characters, the excellent script, and the outstanding performance of the actors.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|when one thinks of follow up albums. like many of you have said, below par is a word for many on the rock scene today, but this album is just quality the more you listen to it.    Not a weak song on here and the all have such depth, its amazing, the more you listen to it the more you will begin to love it.    Must buy.
B000MXPE74|5.0|With all of the mass produced garbage that passes for music nowadays, its refreshing to find an album that can be listened to from start to finish without having to skip a song. Sure, some of the songs aren't all as spectacular as \\"Chelsea Dagger,\\" \\"Henrietta,\\" or \\"Country Boys & City Girls,\\" but this is one of the best new albums I've had the pleasure of listening to in a while. Good job on an awesome album guys!
B000F8O35U|5.0|This landmark film signalled the rejuvenation of the animation division at Disney and of the moribund animated film genre generally. After many years of routine, passionless films, this marked a return to the unabashedly musical and emotional roots of the great Disney animated films of the the past combined now with the modern Broadway musical tradition.<br /><br />The story is simple and sweet, underpinned by masterful songs from the great Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. Perhaps the most lasting legacy of \\"The Little Mermaid\\" is that instead of being films that adults hated, animated films became, once again, entertainment that both adults and kids could enjoy.
B000063Y8F|4.0|Very good product and well built, you can feel it as with all rosle tools. Very easy to clean and looks good too. However my only gripe is that sometimes the sides flex out when I use it and it doesn't stay closed. It's an easy fix (picnh the sides back together a little). Like I said when \\"I\\" use it. When my daughter used it to crush 40-50 bulbs for xmas it was fine. I'm a little stronger than her :) and think I just might have a tendancy to squeeze a little do hard. Other than than that very good item.
055358202X|1.0|I've read over a thousand fiction novels from fantasy, scifi, espionage, detective, lawyer and cop books, and this is book by far involves the mostly poorly conceived editorial choices of all time.  basically Martin took a 2,000 page book, put the worst of it in this book, and saved the best of it for his next book.  what he should have done if finished the series with the best parts of existing character threads here, and throw left over pointless crap into some other book nobody will be compelled to buy.  I have never read a book so bad that it made me want to completely skip chapters about auxiliary characters till this one.  What surprises me even more is how Martin continues throughout this third book to throw away his best character plot lines, by ruining their protagonist.  If you like his first two books, do NOT reward Martin by buying this now. Wait a few years till this third and future fourth books of this series are in a bargain bin somewhere, or the library, and then slog through it hoping the good parts are worth all the pointless chapters you will also want to skip.  This is also the only book I've ever read where the author actually apologizes to his readers after the last chapter, for leaving so much contiguous plot line out from his earlier books.  trust me, if you successfully avoid this book you will thank me one day, and Martin, you need to leave editorial decisions up to a professional, cause you may be creative, but you certainly don't know what the hell you are doing anymore.

Klein's thesis is that fundamentalist, no-holds-barred capitalists--followers of Milton Friedman--and large corporations, starting in the 70s, began either creating or taking advantage of disasters to enrich themselves and make the already poor even poorer.    They fomented coups and torture from Chile to Argentina to Brazil to Thatcherite England to Reaganite America to Poland to Yeltsin's Russia to post-Apartheid South Africa to Sri Lanka to China to post-Katrina New Orleans to Afghanistan to Iraq.    All of this was done, of course, under the dictum that \\"free markets equal free people,\\" when precisely the reverse held true.    \\"Free markets\\" has been a code phrase for Rule by CEOs, and has resulted in the re-sweatshoppery of the world, and the ridiculous re-enrichment of the already rich.    According to Klein, the war on Iraq was not just Dumbassery Run Amok, but INTENTIONAL Dumbassery Run Amok.  Many individuals and corporations are making millions out of this fiasco, and you and I (and of course the poor Iraqis) are paying for it.    Interestingly, she says, the place where all this Vulture Capitalism started, South and Central America, is also the place where it is now being most decisively rejected: Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Uruguay, Nicaragua, Costa Rica.    Perhaps the only good result of the war on Iraq is  that it has so preoccupied George W. Bush that he has not been able to send U.S. troops to Central and South America to destroy democracy in order to save it.    The book is infinitely detailed, and infinitely shocking.      In every place where Vulture Capitalism has taken hold, the living standard of the vast majority has gone down, way down.    Hence the need for torture, violence, and scapegoating to keep the victims, the vast majority, from rebelling against corporate pillage.
B000WGZGNS|1.0|I demand Sony re-release this in a corrected version, the video obviously is stretched beyond what it should be. No I'm not talking about the Widescreen format, I'm viewing it on a Widescreen tv and the source is stretched vertically and is extremely distracting. I'm not the only one that has noticed this, as another review mentions this issue. Nice show, but terrible presentation by Sony.
0375847227|5.0|I was utterly enchanted by this series. I picked up The Golden Compass in a free books pile at the Catholic school where I worked as an English teacher; once I started it, I could not put it down. When I finished, I immediately purchased the next final parts of the series! Many readers have said that The Subtle Knife is the weakest link, and I certianly agree, but I find that's the same for most trilogies.<br /><br />I was surprised to see so many negative reviews of this book, most of them saying that the books are anti-God. I found the series to more to be anti-religious corruption than anti-God. or anti-spiritual. (The deamons in Lyra's world are like souls in our world). Many people lovingly praise the Narnia series; I find this is just one more perspective in religious fantasy. Many reviews quote a nun character as saying Christianity was a big mistake. I think this book can be an excellent way to open up conversations about how people all too often use faith to serve their own needs (as the history of Catholicism and Christianity has shown, in addition to all other religions).  If you are concerned about these aspects regarding your children, read the book first and then decide it you think it's appropriate.<br /><br />I think this book teaches some great values, such as questioning corrupt authority and pursuing the truth. I also love seeing a strong female character in the main role. Also, I like how Pullman highlighs the importance of animals by making daemons take on animals forms. In all, I found this series incredibly imaginative and thought-provoking. I was blown away at the end, and highly recommend this series to fantasy fans of all ages.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|My favorite sci-fi series is Battlestar Galactica.  I've never been a fan of Dr. Who.  Torchwood is simply way too much fun!  The writing in the first series wasn't always consistent, and at times, the special effects were very reminiscent of 1970's Dr. Who.  The characters make Torchwood so good---and carry it brilliantly, especially when they've been given something meaty to work with.  John Barrowman is totally believable as Captain Jack.  (Can he be typecast if I've never been aware of him before?  I will have a difficult time accepting him in any other role!) I could watch Eve Myles forever.  Her performance crying while eating pizza made me laugh AND cry.  Her performance in the last episode was even better.  It took me a little longer to warm up to Burn Gorman's character, but that changed when he fell in love.  His character is still terribly flawed, but understandable.  Poor Ianto and Tosh need more airtime---something that's supposed to happen in Season 2.  My only warning is that this is written for adults and older teenagers.  I would like to know all the possibilities with a stopwatch!

B000VNMMQG|4.0|This movie was a well done piece though the rhythm of the film does ebb and flow.  Iaon Gruffud made a decent effort playing William Wilberforce but was overshadowed by both Rufus Sewell and the actor who portrayed Prime Minister William Pitt and Albert Finney.  Though the charisma Gruffud displayed for Wilberforce seemed a bit uppity and off at times, the solid dignity that is portrayed in his face does more than capture the screen.  Gruffud is a decent actor but a bit too all over the place with his movements, a lot of overt theater habits still apparent on camera.  His face alone carries remarkable expression.   If only he made more use of this quality, he'd be a wonder to behold.  This is an actor with Oscar potential, he just needs to fine tune his abilities.      A good film with a bit of a slow start but a powerful ending.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been listening to Green Day since about when \\"Basket Case\\" came out in 1994.  I've seen this band go through rough times during their career and at one point thought they would break up.  Straight out of producing \\"Warning\\" in 2000 Green Day stopped for a few years until 2004.  That's when I heard on the radio (it's a very rare occasion were I listen to FM radio) \\"American Idiot\\".  Which isn't their strongest song on the album and is a pop song.  But when it comes down to it I can really look past that. And I have spoken to several people about this album.  And some of them have stated that Green Day is no longer punk, they sold out, and it's their worst album to date.    Okay let's break it down:  1.  What really is punk? I don't know, since there really isn't any definition for it. Everyone has their own personal views about what punk is.  There really isn't any real definition for punk.  Honestly, as long as they still care about their fans and music.  It doesn't really matter if their punk.  In this album there is still Green Day in this album.  For any fan that said that their not punk?  Look at \\"Warning\\", it's basically all acoustic album.  It's nothing I would of thought Green Day would do in a full length album.    2.  What does it mean if someone \\"sold out\\"?  Green Day still has a passion for making music.  And you can hear that in this album.  As well as in \\"Bullet in a Bible\\". Like it or not, Billie Joe, Mike, and Tre are maturing as adults. So like or not, Green Day changed after \\"Nimord\\".  To thoughs people who have said that they sold out when they signed up with Reprise.  Why go into the music business in the first place if you don't want to be heard.  You have to sign onto some label major or not.     3. Worst Album to date...I don't know.  That's hard to judge considering Green Day matured over the years.  I guess people don't like the fact the musicians can change and mature as well.  Yes, I know it's overplayed on the radio.  I like how theycan change and have a different point of view on life.  Besides siging about getting high. (expect an occasional reference in this album.)    My basic thing is that I love this album even though it is over-played.  But what Green Day says in this album does need to be said.  (Oh yes, they kinda started a trend with this political stuff qith bands: \\"Ten Thousand Fist\\", \\"I'm not Dead\\", and \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" to name a few.  If that's not influential I don't knw what is)
0807208523|5.0|One prominently placed negative review here suggests that E.B. White's narration ruins an otherwise good story.  I could not disagree more.  Somewhere in the trunk of my car is a well-worn audiocassette version of Charlotte's Web, and I came to Amazon.com to see if it was available on CD.  Luckily, it is.  It is hard to put into words why I really like E.B. White's narration so much, but I would strongly urge anyone considering this purchase to go for it.  His slight New York accent is a refreshing change from so many other audiobooks of children's stories, often read by a young woman, such that they often all sound alike.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|My first Miyazaki movie was Howl's Moving Castle. I liked it so much I looked for more of his work. I came across Porco Rosso but passed on it because I thought a flying pig would be too silly for me. Well after buying most of the other films of Miyazaki and not disappointed I finally bought Porco Rosso. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that it was just as good as the rest of his films. The artwork is top notch. Story keeps you interested all the way through. The seaplanes are great. Voices are terrific. Especially David Ogden Stiers from \\"MASH\\" as Grandpa Piccolo.<br />There is some violence, tabacco and alcohol use in this film so some might not want their children to see. It's more for adults and young children would not understand some of the situations but I personally don't think any of this film would be bad for children.<br />Highly recommended and very enjoyable.<br />Steve
B000ZLJOW4|5.0|\\"Ghost World\\" was the best movie I've seen in a LONG damn time. The key to a great movie is that it's its own world --  a self-contained universe. \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" is one such example, so is \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"For a Few Dollars More.\\" Any of Billy Wilder's movies, too. This one was one of them.  I love Enid. A teenage H.L. Mencken, she skewers pretentious poseurs and tips over sacred cows. But, underneath her outer punk persona, there is a soft-hearted hero-worshipper. Her predicament is that she's stranded on a social desert island and uses cynicism as a shield to protect her from the hopeless banality in which heroes and passion are deemed passe by people who walk through life questioning nothing, but just parroting the answers they've picked up from the larger society.    \\"Ghost World\\" abounds in social commentary, but doesn't fall into the schmaltzy trap of trying to \\"solve\\" the world's social ills. Although on the surface Enid is directionless, she nonetheless has a mania for sketching a diary of the oddballs and weirdos that make up her small town. An excellent artist and charicaturist, Enid ends up failing art class TWICE.    Her airheaded hippy/burnout art teacher, Roberta (Illeana Douglas), is a walking cliche of a total conformist affecting an air of anti-authoritarianism. She blows off Enid's diary and her cartoons of Don Knotts, but pushes her students to instead produce so-called \\"controversial\\" art. A really dead-on scene is when one of Roberta's sycophantic students creates a sculpture out of coathangers, which represents \\"a woman's right to choose, something I feel super-strongly about.\\" It's a gem of a parody on political art in which the politics are much stronger than the art. I was rolling on the floor when Roberta's real bad college art film \\"Mirror/Father/Mirror\\" clip was playing. God damn, that rings true. Roberta doesn't encourage the artistic impulse so much as pushing her agenda on the students to be \\"controversial\\" and \\"confront people's attitudes.\\"    So, Enid decides to spoof Roberta and bring in a \\"found object\\" of a Jim Crow charicature from the 1920s of \\"Coon's Chicken,\\" which depicts a monkey-like negro. This pisses off the other students (who were sotto voce receiving the message that they should only confront people with PC controversy), but the irony of the movie is in how Roberta reacts to the Jim Crow poster; Enid can't get the time of day from her when it comes to her own talented artwork, but her jokes on Roberta's inanities wins Roberta over to her cause and even inspires Roberta to get Enid a scholarship to art college. All this falls apart when Roberta enters the piece in an exhibit, and the local censors force her to remove the poster and fail Enid in her class. Her capitulation reveals her devotion to \\"controversy\\" and \\"confrontation\\" to be a hollow pose, and she covers her [rear] by letting Enid be the lamb to the slaughter.    The relationship between Enid and Seymour (Steve Buscemi) evinces Enid's yearnings to find someone to look up to, rather than down upon. I liked Steve Buscemi a lot. I'm so used to him playing funny roles, that it was sort of incongruous seeing him play it (mostly) straight in a comedic movie, but it worked quite well. Like Enid, Seymour is a middle-aged outcast, and at first becomes the victim to one of Enid's and her best friend Rebecca's (Scarlett Johansson) cruel pranks. But underneath the nerdish and pitiful exterior, Enid comes to discover in Seymour someone as isolated and alientated from society as she is. She finds in him a noble soul, whose passions are worn less on his sleeve than Enid's are, but locked up in his 1920s-themed room dedicated to his 78 rpm blues and ragtime records and poster art from the same era. Enid sees in Seymour a lot of herself, but also someone who has been run over once too many times in life and whose social rebellions have shrivelled into repressed loneliness. Enid finds in Seymour a hero, and gushes \\"I'd kill for a room like this\\" when complimenting his passion for nostalgia. To which Seymour -- who has given up on the possibility of ever fitting in or finding love -- replies \\"go ahead, kill me.\\"    By the movie's end, Seymour starts asserting his inwardly pent-up feelings to relate to the world through his romance with Enid. Finally getting up the nerve to break up with Dana, a nice, though conventionally-thinking person, in order to be with Enid, who shares his passions, and thinks like he does, Seymour nonetheless has his love for Enid somewhat unrequited. Just as the revelation that Seymour deserves happiness manifests itself, Enid alientates herself from the world -- and the two people she most treasured in the world, Seymour and Rebecca. A happy ending does not win the day, because Enid is compelled to travel down the same lonely path that Seymour has. Perhaps in twenty years, she will have become what he is now.    As I recall, this movie was nomimated for absolutely NOTHING by the Academy of Motion Pictures \\"Arts and Sciences.\\" And yet, this was the best movie in a year barren of talent, originality and true cinematic art. Now I understand why this movie is called \\"Ghost World.\\"

There is a high volume of people listening to their stereo albums/cd's in the living rooms/dens/bedrooms that have high quality audio systems. We hope that we can select from the wide variety of musicians that will carry ALL the music sources available to US listeners that still includes the stereo LP. Thank God some big bands still carry this option (David Gilmore-Dire Straits-QUIEX SV-P records) because the sound matters!!! By the way listen to an A/B version of David Gilmore's On An Island cd/album and be prepared to be blown away...why do you think he made this in the first place?!!! Happy listening!
0694003611|5.0|My wife and I were given this book at a baby shower for our new daughter.  We read to her every night and this book is one of our favorites.  I admire the illustrations and the easy rhythm of the language.  I love the blank page with \\"Goodnight, nobody\\" on it.  Very amusing.    This is an excellent gift for a young child.
B000VR824S|5.0|The 2007 Crossroads concert was fantastic - Eric can sure throw a party!  From \\"Living on Tulsa Time\\" to \\"Tell the Truth\\" , it was great to hear real music again.  And, yes, Jeff Beck and his young bass player were fabulous - oh, to hear \\"A Day in the Life\\"!!  Couldn't help loving Johnny Winter's \\"Highway 61\\" -  Johnny, you haven't lost a thing, if anything, you're better than ever!! And, Robbie, it was good to see you - all in all, what a day.
B00023B1LC|5.0|I read the book long before I saw this film. That was why I watched the film expecting to be entertained but not as much as I was. I could not imagine the film living up to the book it did. Enough said.
B000002552|5.0|The poetry of this album is in its humor, its casualness, and a compassion that never takes itself seriously. Of all his albums, this one is Dylan's at his least provocative, and for that very reason it may be one of his most timeless. There is no social statement here, no Mr. Jones, no Slow Train, not even an Idiot Wind. There is, however, a Clothesline Saga, a hero in his own mind who calls himself, ironically, Tiny Montgomery, and a barmaid, one Mrs. Henry, who is less generous with the tap than one would like.
B000ICXQHE|5.0|This movie never quite fills you in on the whole picture until the end but once you see what is going on it is quite interesting and amazing.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is a keeper, one to be watched over again and kept in my files. It rates up there with Cars and Incredibles and Toy Story II. I liked it especially as there was a moral to the story. We might call this a modern Aesop's Fables type story. Good for teen agers especially.
B000UR9TQE|5.0|There are a lot of people who say it didn't need to happen or the improvments are modest,  but I would say don't listen to them.  The sound on the original blew, this is 10 times better and as a result, what sounded like -30 years ago previous- a tired, overworked band now sounds like hammer of the gods.  It really is amazing....rock n roll and black dog, the first few numbers, Plant sounded a little tired but Dazed and Confused really rocks and the sound improvements state just how thunderous this band is, end of or beginning of tour. I remember watching the film long long ago on VHS and DVD and thinking how it kinda sucked because of the sound and even then I thought the soundtrack was more definitive for the band. The film is funner and the band is more fantastic to watch now because the true sound has been unlocked up and unmuffled...hats off to Page and the engineers for making this all over again. It's like watching it for the first time....and sonically because it tromps the original.
0375842381|4.0|This trilogy is well-written (slow going at times) with content that some may find disturbing (especially in Books II and III).  Despite the ads for the movie (The Golden Compass), this series isn't suitable for younger readers.  The lines between good and evil are muddled at times, and the terminology may be disturbing to some (daemons are good, angels can be evil, battling the Authority, etc...).  These books are on the \\"hit list\\" of many religious groups; the author is apparently an atheist, and some feel that these books are encouraging children to turn against God. As with many books, you can see whatever you want to see in these stories.  Personally, I find the underlying themes as dealing with free will, innocence, and the struggle to pursue good when evil takes many forms.  I encourage parents to read these books along with their (older) children and discuss them openly.  NOTE:  The movie (The Golden Compass) glosses over some of the more disturbing elements and events that are in the first book.  If you or your children have seen the movie before reading the book, be prepared for some key differences (and some that may be truly upsetting for young children).

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This film is outstanding.  Its also obvious by the difficulty in seeing it in the theaters and the lack of it being available in stores now that it is released that it is definately a film that big corporate America does not want you to see!<br /><br />We can easily relate to the problems people have had with insurance, even though we have probably better than average insurance through our current employment than a good majority of people with insurance, we were stuck last year with over $10,000 in copays and refused pays for two  relatively  minor health problems illnessess on the radar of health issues. This year our son was ill and hospitalized for a week and we again have probably close to $5000. in copays on that.  We go without health care for issues because we can't afford all the copays.<br /><br />And for the nonsense about people can just go to the emergency room...no you can't, not unless you have money or insurance.  They are only obligated to treat people in life threatening situations, and then only until they are stable.  On more than one occasion I watched people being turned away because they had no money or insurance, they didn't need to be in the emergency room either.  The right wing claim about that is such baloney.<br /><br />Everyone needs to see this film and then demand that our country get profit out of health care.  The big insurance companies are raking in money hand over fist while we all suffer without access to health care or go bankrupt trying to get it.<br /><br />Unless things change drastically in the next 5 years we are making tenative plans to immigrate to Canada ourselves, we can't risk our financial future on the chance one of us might get cancer, heart attack, etc.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|Great CD, all the songs are especially poignant and moving and so James Blunt.  I highly recommend this CD.
B000X5KSWM|4.0|Fans of Nightwish, this your album of the year. Song writing could be better, but Tarja's voice can carry any song.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Believe it or not, this rental came to me my mistake; same title, different movie.<br /><br />When I first saw that it starred Will Farrel, I gritted my teeth. I hated every one of his movies. But I was intrigued, entranced, and totally sucked into the movie. I loved every actor's performance. The story went beyond fantasy and made such a far fetched story more tangible than hum drum reality. I loved the movie and totally expected the hero to die, as expected. The boffo ending had me smiling and looking for some kleenex.<br /><br />You can see what the film is about in the other reviews, and IMO, it really has more heart than The Truman Show. Go ahead and enjoy it, though you'll need milk and cookies.
B000031EGV|4.0|The Jumanji movie is a great story for kids.  My daughter (age 11) had seen it at school and wanted it for herself.  This was the first movie we had ordered from Amazon and I was not happy with the way it arrived.  The disc was bouncing around within the case and the case was kind of banged up.  However, the movie was fine.
B00005JPFH|1.0|This movie was terrible.  The computer animation was horrible. Plot was stupid.  The whole Emo-spidey was absolutely retarded.  The best scene is when Mary Jane gets slapped.  It drew applause from me and my friends.  I hate this movie.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|I love underground Hip Hop...None of that garbage on Mtv or The Radio and I never really gave Kanye a chance..I figured he was just another bogus mainstream rapper but wow I gave this a listen and I'm really impressed...Good uplifting lyrics, great style, alot of good simple beats too, none of that overly poppy club garbage...Kanye is Real. College Dropout is a great LP also...
B0000067L3|5.0|Had this on LP long ago, and I am really glad I got it on CD from Amazon. Never heard it sound so good! Check out the live Spoonful on disc 2, incredible jamming by three very talented musicians in 1968 in San Francisco, need I say more! Plus disc 1 has some jewels on it also! You should add it to your collection soon if you haven't already!
B000V6BE6C|5.0|This album gets even by there own fans....Every song has great riffs, drumming, catchy singing....cool guitar leads/solos...better vocals then on city of evil....and after numerous listens I can't find a bad song. Every A7X album is different....People will say this sucks cuz it doesn't sound like WTF but they are wrong....This rules Esp \\"A Little piece of Heaven\\"
0786868694|5.0|I love Nigella.  She seems like such a real person and it definitely comes across on her shows.  This book has all the great recipes that I drooled over watching her show and the recipes that I have tried have all been wonderful.  The salmon with bok choy and shiitake mushrooms is one of my favorites.  I especially like the space in the book where she suggests writing your own cooks notes.  It's great!
0151013837|5.0|After the sinking of a cargo ship only one lifeboat remains on the Pacific - housing a teen named Pi, a hyena, a zebra and a Royal Bengal tiger. Their survival and journeys makes for a winning book which transcends children's or young adult fiction to provide all ages with a gorgeous, winning contemporary folk story, and this deluxe edition is the perfect gift for capturing it all, using lovely drawings by Croatian artist Tomislav Torjanac to capture key scenes in Martel's drama. A top pick not just for library holdings, but for gift-giving.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This movie shook me to the core. For days, even weeks, I was totally traumatized by the ending. A lot of people talk about how the film's about the love between a mother and son, or robot and human, but to me the allegory can apply to any love. The message I took home from the ending was traumatingly painful. If you have ever experienced unrequited love, and if you carry this burden with you everyday, only then will you really appreciate what David is going through. I have never felt more despair, depression, bleakness and hopelessness in my life than after watching this movie. But the premise, however cruel, rings absolutely true: you can love someone who doesn't return the feeling, and move heaven and earth to get them to love you back, but in the end the only place your deepest desire will come true is in your dreams. Harsh and plenty scary.
0790729407|5.0|Again, we are pleased with the service in getting this DVD and also  are pleased the DVD Michael Collins is good as it was in VHS.  Thank you again.....
B000VNMMQG|3.0|The movie was not that entertaining to watch, and it suffers from a lack of drama, in the sense that the viewer obviously, knows how the movie will generally end.  The effect of the movie is that it does not reveal any fundamental truths about mankind, or the behavior of man-it feels like a documentary made for high school children.  I find that the best stories have a historical situation in the background and a human drama in the foreground.  This movie stumbles a bit with that balance, but the acting is quite good, and it might be worth a look.
B00004ZBVG|5.0|My husband and I are pleased with the DVD Bat 21.  Excellent views.  Service from ordering and receiving it was excellent.  Thank you
B00005JPAO|4.0|Few books or films about a living monarch can avoid caricature. Royalty as a fact on the ground runs so contrary to the spirit of modernity--yet there they *are*!--and still holds such sentimental power for many 'subjects'. The result is the virtual impossibility of a civil discussion about gradated pros and cons.<br /><br />Into this moral sloshing about strides Stephen Frears' THE QUEEN, a movie best remembered for the command performance (queens usually ask for such a thing rather than *giving* it) of Dame  Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II. Almost predictably, the film lurches into the tendency to create and caricature vilains: Cherie Blair and Prince Philip come of as genuine awfuls occupying opposite extremes of the ideological spectrum. Prince Charles and Alisdair Campbell are almost as bad.<br /><br />One might argue that Fears did not *create* those villains, simply portrayed them within an acceptable range of their already existing awfulness. This is plausible. Most of us will never know because we will never know *them*.<br /><br />Yet I find THE QUEEN a gripping film because of its superb narration of a dialogue-of-wary-respect between Blair and the Queen. Mrs Blair even accuses the young prime minister of 'going over' to the royals just as all Labour MPs have gone 'gaga' when given access to them.<br /><br />A word of parenthesis: this American reviewer was living in England at the time of Diana's death, the occasioning fact of this cinematic drama. My family and I had no particular opinion regarding Diana and certainly did not revere her. Yet we found ourselves caught up in the astonishing emotional outpouring that gripped Great Britain and to some extent the wider world in the week following her death. Something happened outside a Paris tunnel that week that none of us would have anticipated and that few understand to this day.<br /><br />It is easy for me to imagine that Blair's conversations with the Queen were just about as Fears depicts them and that this *was* one of those positive outcomes that occasionally ensue when two people of strong character invade each other's company because of circumstances that neither one would have chosen.<br /><br />I find the physical, visual portrayal of Blair unconvincing, though this is hardly fatal to the movie's success. Helen Mirren as the Queen, on the other hand, seems almost eerily true to fact.<br /><br />This flawed but ultimately stirring movie is worth owning and returning to from time to time as distance readjusts the lens on a memory that remains unshakably present for those of us who lived through the events at close hand.that this *was* one of those positive outcomes that occasionally ensue when two people of strong character invade each other's company because of circumstances that neither one would have chosen.<br /><br />I find the physical, visual portrayal of Blair unconvincing, though this is hardly fatal to the movie's success.

B000GAKBLW|4.0|FireFox was made in 1982, with Clint Eastwood as star, director and producer.  It is a two part movie - a spy thriller and then a satisfying high speed MIG chase.  The fun begins when Mitchell Gant (Clint) manages to steal a high speed MIG under the noses of the Communists.<br /><br />FireFox is a Cold War spy thriller that grabs you at the beginning - with Clint playing a Vietnam War vet who has flashbacks and is just glad to be out of the war.  Because he is uniquely qualified - fluent in Russian and a top notch jet pilot, he is the only person our government can find to have a chance at stealing a top secret MIG from a Russian airbase.  This is a cloak and dagger escapade - and one close call after another for Mitchell Gant.  Not only does he have to pass as three different identities, he has to hold his sanity together to steal and deliver the MIG to U.S. agents.  The rest of the cast plays a bit oddly against Clint's character, almost like a Batman movie.  Freddie Jones and Nigel Hawthorne are over the top.  Warren Clarke is more believable.  Ronald Lacey plays a Jewish scientist, in on the plot. I enjoyed the whole movie, however, the second half special effects looked more like a video game. The MIGS flying through deep canyons was deja vu Star Wars and still played out to be really great stuff.
B000VRNCGQ|5.0|Interesting reading the reviews.  I wonder how many of the people who submitted reviews heard the album for the first time in 1969.  You had to be there to appreciate the affect it had on you amid the tumultuous times.  It is impossible to take these albums out of the times they were first heard.  I admit I am biased because I heard the songs for the first time live, even though it was in Bridgeport, CT.  Guess what I bought the next day, then the CD and then the MP3 for my iPod.  While I'm in the middle of a workout at the gym listening to Blind Faith, my mind is in Bridgeport, CT,  now that's what great music is all about and this group made a great album.  Obviously, I'm not a music critic but I know what I like.  Will a rap fan enjoy this CD?  Probably not, but that's their loss.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I have just watched The Sorcerer's Stone on ABC Family channel and there are  additional scenes that are not included in this DVD. Those scenes cut from the DVD actually make the film version more closely follow the book and are important to the context of the whole story. I am so disappointed. I thought I had purchased the theatrical release of the movie. Any ideas on how to tell which is the complete movie and not just a cut-up version?
1592332803|5.0|When people think about vegan desserts, they think that they are going to get hoodwinked into eating healthily. Well, folks, Ms. Patrick-Goudreau has completely debunked any myths regarding vegan desserts. Love chocolate? Me too. It's here. Love a good cookie like me? Your soymilk will no longer be lonely. How about savory? Cornbread? Olive bread? Seriously, people. You can't go wrong. There is a wide range of recipes that will make you a successful baker--even if you are short on time.    What I also really appreciate is that is a really well written and organized cookbook.  (Can you say multiple indexes? I'm a geek I know, but who doesn't love an index when you are pressed for time?) The recipes are clear. There is an abundance of information and helpful suggestions yet it does not feel overwhelming. Anytime you open up this book, you are invited to discover something new about the tantalizing world of vegan desserts. What in the world could be wrong with that?    So, now, go forth and bake vegan. Wow your family, friends, coworkers. The proof is in the pudding--of which there are a few recipes in this book, I might add!  Anyway, I dare anyone to take a bite into any one of these desserts and tell me it tastes like wheatgrass because it is not laden with cholesterol. No way. No how. These recipes are utterly delectable in every way a dessert should be.    I know that I will enjoy this book for years to come.
B000WSHF4E|4.0|There were two tides of hype for this movie: it started off with the brilliance of Cate Blanchett reprising her old role that propel to international stardom, the next wave came when the movie was put down as badly executed production with brilliant subject (though some lack historic evidence) and an outstanding cast.<br /><br />The Golden Age picked up where last time was left behind. Elizabeth is a loved queen who refused to punish the Catholics for their belief. However, Europe is still not ready for a Protestant bastard ruler in the area. So the Spanish plot of assassination and invasion rolled up. Elizabeth, apart from being threatened by the overseas forces is also going through her personal struggle - aging and not being able to love anymore (or show affection) as a virgin queen. The premise is great as it shows that we are treading into the premises of the fear of age while try to put yourself together publicly. However, this is also the premises that brought the less convincing Clive Owen and Abbie Cornish characters in. Elizabeth tried to feel what was like to be a woman again through them but only to find out that the same put her into more misery. The plot was a quite winding but very predictable. Also this time round Walsingham (Georffrey Rush) had family affairs to attend to - which was supposed to put some human touch in him - didn't work miracle either. So the subplots all became very loose as Elizabeth carried further burden of avoiding the movie to fall apart on top of her scripted threats.<br /><br />Performance-wise, Cate Blanchett is brilliant as usual. However, she is now so good that unless she changed her identity to play Bob Dylan, it might not be able to secure her another Oscar. She could end up like Meryl Streep being nominated in whatever she does, but needs more luck to win as she is now being taken for granted as a great actress of our age. Never like Abbie Cornish. For her role, anyone can do it and I personally think that Scarlett Johansson will be able to put so much more depth into the character while radiating it with doses of sex appeal even when she is wrapped up like cake in her costume. For Clive Owen, he is good but not good enough to make his story line interesting. But he definitely has the power to shake Elizabeth to her core. Clive has that touch of openness that made his scenes with Cate so much more interesting. But all his other scenes with Abbie Cornish is just like \\"ok we got it can we move on?\\"<br /><br />Elizabeth: The Golden Age is not a bad movie, and especially after reading 6000 million bad reviews about it and then you watch it without expectation. But I think all the bad reviews didn't really do justice to the movie itself. Elizabeth was great and it was an unexpected runaway hit, so the stakes are high this time. If this is not a sequel, I think the critics will be much more lenient - well they are lenient enough to say Cate Blanchett is the only saving grace for the movie - instead of full scale bashing. So the best approach will be watch it as an individual movie and forget about the movie 9 years ago, then you will be able to enjoy it. But one thing that bugs me most are all those stills trying to tell you how much money they put into the costumes and sets. Come on, it's period piece they ARE suppose to look great, especially when you are talking about the court. And one last thing - yes you can compare the Cate 10 years ago with the present Cate as it has two split second flash back of the young Elizabeth from the 1998 movie.able to put so much more depth into the character while radiating it with doses of sex appeal even when she is wrapped up like cake in her costume.

0451205766|5.0|okay, a review on here said that Puzo was a hack writer, explain why it is a bestseller, and say the movie made it a bestseller it was a hit before the movie was made, besides, how many books have written, if you have any published i would be very surprised. Second, another review said that the movie had a better plot, WTF the book and movie were damned near the same.Puzo had written the script for all three godfather films with cappola, the godfather is my favorite movie of all, but the book is better.
B000W4KT64|5.0|This movie is just plain fun. John Travolta demonstrates his considerable talents by playing the obese Edna. The entire cast is marvelous, particularly Nikki Blonski, a newcomer, as Tracy and Amanda Bynes plays the sweet, at first naive Penny to a T. Oddly, Michele Pfeifer didn't seem up to the rest of the cast, but didn't drag them down either.<br /><br />  In any event, the cast works, the script works, the movie works.<br /><br />  It's a message movie with a light heart. Integration comes to Baltimore in 1962, but more importantly so does young love for the chubby Tracy Turnblad. Nikki Blonski, a weighty gamin at 4'10\\" brings so much power to her role that it basically sweeps you off your feet.<br /><br />  Only 19 herself, she exudes the vibrancy, innocence and desires of an adolescent. Really quite a performance.<br /><br />  It's hard not to look at Travolta in drag and not think \\"Geez, that's John Travolta in drag\\", but he still carries off the part well.<br /><br />  It's a singing, dancing extravaganza, just as outrageous as the John Waters original, only this time with singing and dancing. A lot of plain old-fashioned fun.<br /><br />Jerry

B00008DDXC|3.0|While sitting in my living room watching Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on ABC Family channel, I find I am seeing bits and pieces on my TV screen that are not in this edition of the DVD. For instance, Harry has arrived in Diagon Alley via flue powder and has an incident with a hand. In this DVD, which I own, Harry then immediately opens the exterior door to the shop and leave. In the version I am watching on ABC Family channel, Drako and Lucius Malfoy enter the shop to do business with the propietor. This is just one of the cuts I found in my DVD. There are others. In the library after the dueling club meets, Harry leaves the room and a conversation among his classmates ensues. Then outside the library, Harry has a conversation with Hagrid regarding roosters.  I am disappointed to learn of the cuts in this DVD. I thought I was purchasing the theatrical release of the movie and not a chopped up version of the film. Any ideas on how to discern which is the real theatrical release?
B000F8O4DQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B000F8O4DQ A New World Record]]    Jeff Lynn and the group provide excellent entertainment.  Their CD is of a superior quality.  Their is not a product that they produced that isn't successful.
0670034711|3.0|I too read this book for a book group. I expected more. Maybe it was the age level as she is a good 15 years younger than me, but she came across as frivolous and self-absorbed. I love food too but aren't there other aspects to Italy, seat of the Renaissance? I couldn't get over that she didn't even go into Puccini's home, just went to the restaurant across the street. I guess we are supposed to find that funny. And the India/enlightenment section was quite a slog.    On the other hand, if you are interested in it from a insider's view of an ashram and of the holistic healing/yoga culture of Bali, it is informative. And her encounters with various expats and spiritual seekers can be pretty entertaining. Just don't expect a fully-informed description of the countries she visited.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|This movie is a great mind games horror movie.<br />You have to have creativity to understand this movie.<br />Plus it's not the same old slasher movie.<br />I got to say slasher horror movies are old,<br />to me this was a good change of pace.<br />If you think this is stupid you haven't<br />seen \\"The Grudge 1 & 2\\"!!<br />I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!

B0007PAMBK|5.0|Mike Nelson does it again.  He makes a really bad movie into a funny movie!  The colorization looks great. Half the time you are not sure what is going on.  The director plays a character in the movie.  Mike Nelson makes it easier to watch.  If you need a good laugh I would recommend watching this movie, even though it was suppose to be scary....it's not.

0316067598|5.0|Lone Survivor was a \\"must read\\" for me after seeing a Marcus Luttrell interview last summer.  This young man is a hero in every way.  He has succeeded in a rigorous training with Navy SEALS, served in very dangerous situations, and has lost friends in combat.  He not only has lived to tell the story, but has made it his mission to honor these principals and the memories of these men.  The collaboration on the book brings out the enduring positive attitude, down-home sincerity, strength and integrity of this young man.  I have purchased a number of copies of this book to share.  Everyone who has read Lone Survivor has come away with a deeper understanding and respectful appreciation of those who serve our country.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I am listening to this cd for the first time and from the first note, it takes my breath away.  It is that good.  This little girl has a voice to rival any jazz great I can think of.      I loved \\"Back to Black\\" (who doesn't) and am one of the few individuals who has been fortunate enough to actually see Amy perform live (and not cancel).    All I can think of when I listen to her is what a terrible tragedy it will be for the music world if someone does not save this child from her self-destructive behavior.
B00065JTBA|5.0|I missed this when it first came out because I figured it was just their old albums \\"boxed\\" with a few bonus tracs like every other boxed set out there. *****But this is the boxed set of boxed sets!***** Not a rehash, but tons of unreleased  Bon Jovi goodness. Top quality demos of the progressions of songs and ideas and variations of what could have been + previously unreleased tracs. A must have for any Bon Jovi fan. Great stuff.

B000LC51TM|5.0|I first heard their music while I was enroute to Kuwait. Our flight stopped off in Germany for a couple of hours and the airport had us holed up in an unused portion of the airport. They had little shops set up to keep our intersts occupied. They had this video playing and it immediatly attracted us rock enthusiasts. The local price was over $55, so I wrote down their name for an Amazon.com search when I returned. I paid less on-line which made it that much sweeter. The music is in German, but their live show is awesome! Best rock group from Germany since The Scorpions. I have since purchased their latest CD and am very pleased with it as well.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|I became hooked on the Gilmore Girls when a friend gave me season 1 for Christmas 2 years ago.  Since then, I've bought all the others on DVD and the friend is still on season 2.  I was sad to learn the Amy and Daniel were leaving after season 6, but had high hopes for the witty banter and inane trivia to continue unabated.  Season 7 was, in some regards, a let down, but overall, a wonderful end to an unrivaled show.    The only thing I am truly sad about, now that I have just finished watching the entire 7th season, is that Rory didn't say yes.  I understand why she didn't, and don't fault her for it, but I would have loved to have seen the Rory/Logan wedding.    The non-Amy and Daniel writers did a wonderful job with the last episode, and while we never got to see the Luke/Lorelai wedding happen, we know that eventually it would come.    Yes, you should buy the whole series.  Watching Rory grow up, watching Lorelai grow up, spending 7 years just waiting for the perfect Luke and Lorelai moment, just knowing that everything would be alright in the end ...
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Characters who have been around for a long time, basically crossing generational gaps, usually come to a point when they need a facelift to maintain their appeal for later generations.  Superman got one in the series, Smallville.  Batman got one in Batman Begins.  James Bond, which has been around for nearly fifty years on screen, was also badly in need of some reinvention.  After the Mission Impossible films and the Bourne films, it was clear that audiences are into much more serious characters than the tongue-in-cheek Bond.  In the last few Bond films, the wit was getting old, and people began to tire of the ridiculous, unrealistic stunts that Bond would pull off.  Jumping off a cliff on a motorcycle to climb into an airplane?!?<br /><br />Casino Royale puts Bond in a much more realistic light.  While he might have a couple of witty lines, he's very serious character who takes his job very seriously.  And while he might pull off some brilliant maneuvers, he's not performing stunts that are clearly outside the realm of possibility.  The audiences quickly responded to this new James Bond.  Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Pierce Bronsan have each already christened Daniel Craig as THE new James Bond with high praise.<br /><br />Casino Royale takes us back to the very beginning of James Bond, before he's given his 007 status.  We get to see who Bond starts out and what events shape the man he will eventually become.  For example, you will be given a glimpse as to Bond's treatment of women.<br /><br />Bond is given his first assignment as a \\"00\\" agent.  He has to find a way to stop a man, LeChiffe, from funding terrorism by taking his money in a poker game.  Anyone who's watched the World Series of Poker will find the poker scenes to be crisp and suspenseful.  Bond is pegged as the best card player in the agency (no surprise there!), which is one of the reasons why he's chosen for this assignment.<br /><br />One good thing about this new Bond, is that he is not infallible; he makes mistakes, even being as good as he is, there are those who are even better.  The fun is watching how Bond finds ways to outsmart his opponents.  Gone are the times when things just happen to fall into place for Bond.  One mistake nearly costs him his life.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is a terrific James Bond.  Some people have already pegged him as their favorite Bond.  I still think it's hard to beat Sean Connery, but Daniel Craig comes awfully close.  Craig succeeds in making Bond his own character.  He isn't trying to mimick Connery, Brosnan, or anyone else.  His Bond is very serious, and many of the Bondisms are now gone.  For example during a scene at the bar, Bond asks for a martini.

The fun is watching how Bond finds ways to outsmart his opponents.  Gone are the times when things just happen to fall into place for Bond.  One mistake nearly costs him his life.    Daniel Craig is a terrific James Bond.  Some people have already pegged him as their favorite Bond.  I still think it's hard to beat Sean Connery, but Daniel Craig comes awfully close.  Craig succeeds in making Bond his own character.  He isn't trying to mimick Connery, Brosnan, or anyone else.  His Bond is very serious, and many of the Bondisms are now gone.  For example during a scene at the bar, Bond asks for a martini.

And one thing has been overlooked during all of this and that is that Frey CAN tell a wonderful story that is filled with hope. So for all you people who have a problem, yes its parts are embellished DEAL WITH IT.If its so bothersome to you, stop whining and go pick up another book.
0140067477|5.0|The Tao of Pooh is a wonderful, simple explanation of the basic tenets of Taoism.  It is not the end-all-be-all of Taoism reference, but for those of us interested in learning more about Eastern Thought, it is a delightfully entertaining way of doing so.    I don't think Pooh knew he was quite the philosopher, and I'm not sure A. A. Milne intended him to be, but it turns out that he explains basic Taoism very well.    I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about basic Taoism, wants to make positive changes in their lives, or who just loves Pooh and has an open mind.
B000YAF4OS|3.0|I listened to the story years ago and do not remember the book's ending.  I have been told they changed the ending.  a MIST inhabits a small town and townfolks come running to a local grocery store spouting there is something in THE MIST!!  yes, and they soon find out too.  so, I went and saw the movie yesterday and the movie was very entertaing.  the characters were well defined and the movie developed at a good pace.  good direction from a wonderful director DARABONT--he really knows how to flush out characters.  scary and eerie and sometmes clasutrophobic it made me jump a couple of times.  however, the movie was hilarious at times because of settings or conversations(characters would blurt out the most stupid lines)-I am not sure if it was serious or not!!.  so, for most of the movie I enjoyed it for its campiness but the ending was cool too-however incredibly BLEAK--a real downer but somehow appropriate.  special effects were excellent with strong characters(however silly) and an ending I think STEPHEN KING probably enjoyed.  its not a feel good movie, but its a movie that felt good to me at the end.

B000063UR2|2.0|I love this film and was so stoked to get \\"The Ultimate Edition\\". As soon as I began to watch I realized the film score is not the score done by Tangerine Dream but is instead the score by Jerry Goldsmith(most obvious in the scene of Mia Sara and her dark dance transformation). I had first seen this film with the Tangerine Dream score so the Goldsmith score was a terrible distraction to me. The T.D. music framed and complemented the film much more and really added a beautiful touch to the atmosphere of the movie.    This is still a great film and is one of the best performances by Tim Curry. There is a good deal of extra footage too.

B00070DK5K|4.0|I've had David Live on cassette, vinyl, and now of course on CD. I truthfully have not listened to David Live end to end in 20+ years. The CD sounds really great! If they've cleaned it up or digitally re-mastered the CD they did a nice job. This is David at his peak (in my opinion of course) and is a must own CD 2-disc'er. Not any deliberate \\"voice overs\\" so common to Live recordings either A plus.

Schwartz speaks of items that all of us can do daily, but these things can greatly improve our chances of meeting our dream/reach goals in life.  His roadmap is easy to follow and his ideas are straight-forward enough to put into action right now.
1400063515|5.0|I read this book from cover to cover and decided it was the most significant book I had ever read. However, although entertaining, it is not an easy read, so having completed it I immediately re-read it to improve my grasp of the subject. I believe that Taleb has struck a blow for common sense in deflating the phony experts and their reliance on elegant mathematical models, that are based on completely false assumptions about the real world.    This book is a compulsory read for anyone who wants to understand the world we live in.
B00000ADG2|4.0|The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is generally considered to be among the very best hip-hop albums of the 90s (for instance, it was nominated for ten Grammys, taking home five including Best Album). I have to, respectfully, disagree. There's nothing bad about Miseducation, in fact, it has some extremely high moments, but it falls short of true greatness (the 9/10 range).     Have you ever heard of the problem of firsts and lasts? It refers to the tendency of artists to put all their good music at the beginning and the end of a CD, and include the weaker stuff/filler in the middle. Miseducation instead suffers from just firsts and 11ths and 13ths. The first four tracks are killer, and then most of the rest is fine and sometimes good but nothing special.    A consistent problem for Lauryn is that while her flow is good when she raps, she often creates awkward rhythms when she sings her verses. It's weird. And in a related problem, her choruses are consistently far more interesting than her verses. It's especially noticeable on songs like \\"Ex-Factor,\\" \\"When It Hurts So Bad,\\" \\"I Used to Love Him,\\" \\"Forgive Them Father,\\" and \\"Every Ghetto, Every City. \\"     Songs     Intro NA/10: The intro sets the stage for the skits that are present throughout the album: A class meets, talking about love and relationships, but Lauryn is absent. She is instead receiving her \\"miseducation.\\" I like the skits in general when listening to the album together, but the fact that they're not usually separate tracks makes using the songs in playlists frustrating. Ugh.    Lost Ones 9/10: Competing with \\"Doo Wop\\" for best rap on the album, and I think her flow is best on this track. However, as usual, the chorus is better than any of the verses though the gap is less noticeable than on many other songs. This is one of the songs I really love.    Ex-Factor 8/10: The early verses are actually a little blah, but the bridge (or is it a second chorus because it's repeated? I don't know musical terms) isreally awesome, and this is the most touching song on the album in general. Lauryn has obviously been terribly hurt in her relationships, and it really shines through here.     To Zion 9/10: Maybe the most musically interesting song (featuring a Carlos Santana guitar solo) along with \\"Doo Wop,\\" \\"To Zion\\" is the best example of Lauryn's singing talent. Another very moving song with occasionally slightly clunky lyrics. Nonetheless, excellent track.    Doo Wop (That Thing) 9/10: What is there to say about this song? You've all heard it before, and, therefore, you should know how awesome it is. Musically excellent, with really good rapping, and then that wonderful chorus. The last truly excellent song on the album, only four songs in.     Superstar 5.5/10: Here's where things take a turn for the worse. The song opens with a very interesting rap that leaves me wanting more but quickly shifts into a boring R&B song. One of my least favorite on Miseducation.    Final Hour 6.5/10: A pretty good song actually (there's nothing on Miseducation that's actually bad) with pretty good flow and lyrics but a mediocre beat.     When It Hurts So Bad 6.5/10: The perfect example of a song with an excellent chorus/bridge thing, but really weak, boring verses.     I Used to Love Him 7/10: Same problem as above, with slightly better verses. And man, that chorus is good.    Forgive Them Father 7/10: Again the same problem, though the difference is less pronounced (the chorus isn't quite as good; the verses aren't as bad).     Every Ghetto, Every City 8/10: The verses are still a little weak, but it's musically so much more interesting than the previous songs that it doesn't really matter. A very enjoyable song.    Nothing Even Matters 5/10: The same slow, mediocre verses without the beautiful chorus to save it.    Everything Is Everything 8/10: The first truly balanced song in a long time. The beat is really good, she alternates between singing and rapping, and I actually want to listen tothe verses. This song makes me happy though not because it's especially optimistic or anything.     The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill 7/10: Another very slow, pretty static R&B song, but this one is more interesting lyrically, emotionally and musically.    And then there are two bonus tracks, neither of which are particularly bad or good. The thing that bothers me though, and this happens on a lot of CDs, is that \\"Miseducation\\" is clearly the thematic end to the story. However, the bonus tracks (which are on virtually every version) extend the album, and leave it without the thematically correct ending. Why do artists do this? Wilco's A Ghost Is Born is the perfect example, where \\"Less Than You Think\\" needed to be the end, but instead they tossed the incongruous (but good) bonus track \\"Late Greats\\" after it. Why don't they just put it in the middle of the CD as a regular album track? Also, it was on every version of the CD released, so in what sense was it a \\"bonus\\"?    Overall 8/10 : The things I've said about Miseducation have been largely negative, but that is, to some extent, a product of how highly regarded it is, as well as its inconsistency. The truth is that, however, it's really an excellent album, and the first four songs by themselves would be worth owing the whole CD.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is the best motion picture I have seen in 2007.  It rivals Gandhi in its inspiration and ability to move the heart.  Having seen this movie, I deeply admire William Wilberforce (well-portrayed by Ioan Gruffud) as a sincere, persevering and dedicated reformer whose belief in God motivated his efforts.  But it is his friend, who was also Prime Minister at the time, William Pitt, who nurtures Wilberforce, helps set him on his path and who also never gives up on the dream of the abolition of the slave trade in the British empire.  Prime Minister Pitt (as magnificently played by Benedict Cumberbatch) is a model of leadership worthy of study.    The movie weaves together the personal and world political circumstances of the time accurately and in an understandable manner.  I was pleased to see Rufus Sewell in a non-villain role, and thought all the actors played their parts well, with particular appreciation for Michael Gambon as a savvy political insider, Albert Finney as friend and minister to Wilberforce and author of the words to the hymn \\"Amazing Grace\\", and Romola Garai as the woman who heals Wilberforce's spirit and enables him to resume his fight for the Cause after many years of effort and defeat.     I highly recommend this movie for World history classes covering this period of time, and for anyone with the desire to contribute to the making of a better world.

B000P7V46C|2.0|As many reviewers have pointed out, a Genesis remaster series is a welcomed endeavor. Both music and artwork go hand in hand with this group, and bringing both up to speed seemed timely. I thought the 1994 remaster of \\"And Then There Were Three\\" was a great improvement over its unsweetened predecessor. Nothing seemed too overdone. And Then There Were...these!  Many people have commented on the overuse (or even simply the use at all)of compression when remastering the Genesis catalog. I have to agree fully that to my ears, this is a sonic hatchet job. Genesis is a band with wide dynamics, soft passages lead to swells, delicate acoustic guitars and pianos give way to deep resonating bass pedals, etc. What we have with the remasters, at least with Wind And Wuthering & ATTWT, is a horrid \\"evening out\\" sensation. It is a crunching of signal pushing the limits at the upper ceiling before zero, and bringing up any soft passages to a numbing \\"average\\" on par with louder passages. Case in point: \\"Burning Rope\\". There is a passage where a dissonant instrumental section leads to a swell before succumbing to a more melodic finish. On the '94 release it is wonderful. On this release, there is really no crescendo, just a loud start and a loud finish. All sense of dynamics are lost. I know there was remixing involved on all tracks, so that could play into it but those who know the original will hear it right away.  Some improvements? Ok, the vocals are more pronounced (probably by eq in the 4k range), more elements of the mixes stand out, and there is a clarity to it all. Having said that, I would trade it in an instant for a more tasteful use of compression. Loud is not always better.  Listen to \\"Snowbound\\" and the way the drums are now overly processed and beefed up. Again, a remix result, but it loses something to my ears, compared to the '94 issue.  The net result of these reissues leave me with an uneasy feeling of having to choose. I like the fact that added clarity in the vocals now exist on the remasters, but I ended up keeping my 1994 copy for \\"Wind\\" and \\"ATTWT\\". I suppose if I am in a mood for a Genesis album on steroids, I can pop in the new guys, but I think I will more likely dip into the 94 releases and cut my losses. (hearing losses?)  Any thoughts?

B000007XUQ|5.0|Oh- I know what you're all thinking. You're thinking that there goes Metamorpho clinging to the middle-of-the-road - being at the center again. What is he trying to accomplish? Is he running for public office again? When will he ever learn?<br />Well- no my people. I am here to report on this selection which is so superb for the holiday season that it really doesn't matter where it stands in the ultimate spectrum of things. I have virtually immersed myself in this music the past week (yes- I do NOT review anything without trying to absorb it totally! - Thus, the sacrifice and oath we Seers must take to serve the public good!). Again, I am here to report a seasonal goody which is well worth your attention and consideration.<br />After coming to my senses some time ago- I have discovered that Karen Carpenter is one of America's treasures. At least in the pop field. I am not going to get into a debate over who is the best singer of the 20th century and all that nonsense. It hardly matters. But, I will tell you, conclusively, that Karen Carpenter had one of the RICHEST vocals I have ever heard. That is without a doubt in my considerable Seer's mind. Believe me- it's true.<br />These 2 c.d.s are a treasure trove of what Christmas is and defines it in ways that are miraculous and joyous. For me, it is pure ectasy and a musical trip well worth the taking this holiday season.<br />First off- let's talk about the orchestration. You know- I never gave Richard Carpenter enough credit as an arranger. However, here, I can see true talent at work. The arrangements are a wonder and so very well done. Admittedly, he is not a great vocalist (and wisely left most of that task up to Karen). However, these songs morph into one another effortlessly. And, I know it couldn't have been easy. But this double c.d is pure indulgence into the spirit of the holidays and it is one of the best seasonal offerings I've ever heard.<br />It is so tasty. The orchestra and piano are things to behold. They can romp, swing, and play lightly giving true reverence to holy, religious songs that are, after all, the real meaning of this holiday. Richard employs the appropriate background singers to good use. But Karen, and rightly so, is the mainstay of this music.<br />Richard had to work around Karen's demise for one of these c.d.s. And, he does a good job of it. However, he relies heavily on medley fills here-and some may feel it's a bit too much. But, it is a very small complaint as long as we can get to hear Karen.<br />I was amazed on first hearing that, not only did they do alot of the \\"standards\\" that we all know at Christmas time. But they extended their musical vision to include things that I've never heard before but are so essential to this time of year. Lovely and inspired.<br />This music is a journey. It cartwheels and moves in highs, middles and lows like a rollercoaster. But, it is so well put together. It moves in  whichever way it wants to go. But, on balance, it is right on and so very well done. It is pure joy. Alot of these tunes are associated with certain arists. My favorite of all time is \\"The Christmas Song\\" by Nat King Cole. However, Karen does an intro I am not familiar with and does a superb cover of this song. Beautiful.<br />I would be remiss to omit one of my favorites from this album. Karen's vocals on \\"Little Altar Boy\\" approach the heavens. It is so easy to see why this song is one of Richard's favorites. It is mine too. It is heartfelt and the undulation moves a Seer's heart in wonderful and miraculous ways.<br />In closing- this is good stuff. Really good stuff! I can not do without it this time of year. It is timeless and a treasure for all the holidays to come. Karen had one of the best vocals I have ever heard and the arrangements are exemplary! Do yourself a favor. If you want to hear an exceptional Christmas album- this is the one to get. Beautiful, lush, and one of the very best.<br />Thank-you Karen. You were the unrivaled wecould ever hope to listen to.<br /><br />Elf shoes are hurting my toes-your holly(day) Metamorphoare hurting my toes-your holly(day) Metamorpho
B000MR9D5E|3.0|The HD photography ranges from superb and stunning (e.g. the Angel Falls to several scenes with a jarring oversaturation of colors - who has ever seen water that is quite SO blue? The color 'artist' should have exhibited much more maturity and restraint. While the overall quality is excellent, the kitsch line was crossed more than once.    I have to agree with some of the reviewers - the series is narrowly focused on the merciles brutality of the food cycle - fish eats fish in order to be eaten by a bigger fish.  I am not offended by the sight of carnivores feasting on their prey, but in the ovewhelming context the segment on the vegetarian panda was a refreshing break (I never liked the pandas before).  Yes, the piranhas can clean a fish in minutes, and therefore ...???    There is a lot of 'shock and awe' and not too much depth or continuity of thought.  Like many others I bought this series for my children.  I was expecting to find a considerably deeper and thoughtful presentation.

B0006GANN2|5.0|Here's the game: if you have nothing better to do, rate the chase scene in this movie with the one in \\"Bullitt\\". Hackman won a well deserved Oscar in his role as Popeye Doyle, a maverick cop who is highly adept at bringing in \\"small-timers\\" but never the \\"big fish'. Enter a solid tip that Rey is smuggling in a huge amount of drugs from Marseilles, worth millions of dollars on the streets. Doyle springs into action, against the better judgement of his boss and some fellow  officers. One memorable scene after another ensues: the showdown with Rey at Grand Central,the incredible chase scene in Brooklyn, the car stripdown, and the final shootout/recovery of drugs and money along with yet another death of a fellow officer;this time it's his harshest critic. Incredibly, Rey escapes, only to reappear 4 years later in France. Incredible also is that this is a Christmas holiday movie, as the opening shots show. Never seen this movie? Why?

B000VSBX34|5.0|This charming film had been out of print for far too long (the last time I'd seen it was 1997!), but the powers that be finally did the right thing and not only issued it on DVD, but beautifully remastered it as well.  It's been well worth the wait.  The film is just as fun, cute, and entertaining as I remember it.  Though I know that AHDN is technically supposed to be the superior film, I've always preferred 'Help!' for some reason, perhaps because it has more of a plot.  The plot, Ringo getting a large sacrificial ring stuck on his finger and then having to evade the people trying to capture him for their religious ritual, is admittedly paper-thin and rather ridiculous, but not in a bad way.  The adventures he and his mates go through in their quest to outrun the bad guys and save his hide are full of charm, fun, wit, absurb humor, British humor, and spoofing of the James Bond genre.  They also showcase some great settings, among them the Alps and the Bahamas.  The songs performed are among the very early music videos, easily as innovative as anything from the era of the music video as a deliberate artform.  They really do seem to be the precursors to the music video, since they're more than just the band singing their songs.  My favorite songs on the soundtrack are probably \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\" and \\"I Need You.\\"  It also doesn't hurt that The Beatles look so great in color, and still so young, fresh-faced, and gorgeous.  It's hard to decide which one is my favorite in this film, since they're all so charming, funny, and cute!  They also faithfully showcase the personalities they'd been tagged with, but in a natural way; there's not any sense that they're merely spoofing labels like \\"the cute one,\\" \\"the sarcastic witty one,\\" \\"the quiet serious one,\\" and \\"the dopey but loveable one.\\"  And their four unique personalities really help to make this film so infectiously fun, the type of thing the whole family can watch, instead of just young kids or older people who want a trip down memory lane.<br /><br />The extras included on the basic edition are pretty good, a lot better than the disappointing bonus material on the current DVD of AHDN.  There are trailers, a featurette on the restoration of the film (proving that film restoration isn't just needed for films from the distant past), a making-of mini-documentary, the description of a missing scene (contrary to how it's described as the actual missing scene itself), a featurette of the cast and crew reminiscing about the film, a couple of radio spots hidden on the menu, and a booklet with great pictures and information about the making of the film.  I do wish there had been even more bonus features, but I'm more than happy with the basic edition over the ridiculously overpriced deluxe edition.  I also wish the discs had been put in separately; I hate when two-disc sets arrange them so that they're overlapping one another.  This can make it easier to scratch or damage a disc when you're removing it.  This film truly has never looked or sounded better, and while it's not really the stuff of great classic film, it is a really fun film.  Not everything is intended as great cinema; sometimes you just want to be entertained by something lightweight like this.  Getting reacquainted with the film after so many years away really made me kind of feel like a teenager again.people who want a trip down memory lane.

B000EOTAM6|3.0|THE PROS: Ms. Theron actually made a decent Aeon; the eyes were right, the hair was close enough, the suit she wore was prefurable over what the original Aeon wore, her voice was pretty close, & it's really not her fault that Aeon seemed out-of-character; she's not the one who wrote the script or changed the story. I liked the inside references to specific episodes & the effort of trying to make sence of the original story by making connections. I also like how the characters who barely lasted 5 minutes before getting killed in the series got a longer role in the movie; that was cute. The special effects fancy moves were appropriate.  ___________________________________________________________________________  ___________________________________________________________________________  THE CONS: The movie would have been better if it didn't have the time restrictions of being a single movie. All of that stuff was supposed to happen over years, not a week or less. Despite the inside references, too much new & adultered content was unnessisarily slapped into a movie that already had enough reference material not to need it. There are simply too many changes; it was like watching X-Men after growing up with the comic &/or animated series. I won't say what; some of it is coverd by the Wikipedia, the rest you can find out yourself by watching the series. My other irks were lack of music that really set the mood for the series; the way the hate part of Trevor & Aeon's love-hate relationship was looked over, Aeon being Trevor's long-lost-wife Katherine, Una being related to Aeon, Trevor having a brother, Trevor not having his signature  almost-albino look, the way they hid the fact that Aeon & Trevor are all-around sadistic, not-nice people, the fact that they used the cloning & not Nargals to explain loss of memory, Monika not being a seperate country, & how easily Aeon blew that ship from the sky.
B000RPCK1U|4.0|Two years after Pierce Brosnan's first Bond film \\"Goldeneye\\", he returns for his second Bond outing in \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\".  Though not as sharp as Goldeneye, this Bond film is still strong and probably Brosnan's second best Bond film.<br /><br />The story behind Tomorrow Never Dies actually felt somewhat original.  Stories seemed to become a rehash lately of previous Bond films, all focusing too much on world domination and Russia always somehow being involved.  An insane maniac known as Elliot Carter wishes for that similar world domination, but in a unique style.  In successful attempts at pitting China against Britain in hopes of starting a third world war, Carter's secret attacks from his stealth ship enable him to write tomorrow's news today - and broadcast world wide along all forms of media.  The clever and twisted results would give Carter fame and glory, as well as richness beyond belief, while watching the world tear itself apart around him.  Technology has made a proufound impact in this Bond movie, between Carter's media and his stealth ship.  The technology made this Bond film quite up to date, and felt fitting.<br /><br />Tomorrow Never Dies has a decent list of charcaters.  Brosnan seems like the same Bond since Goldeneye - not a tremendous performance, but complete none the less.  Carter is an original villain with his clever ways, but still can't compare to some of the more famous classic Bond villains.  Carter's henchman is a fine choice, having the look of another ex-KGB brute, and like past KGB villains, giving Bond an excellent final fight.  The Bond girl - Michelle Yeoh - is actually my favorite Bond girl.  She does just about as much as James to get the mission accomplished.  And the best part is - she knows martial arts.  If you are familiar with Michelle Yeoh, you may have seen her in Crouching Tiger or Jackie Chan's Supercop.  She is no stranger to excellent martial arts, and gets a couple of great fights here.<br /><br />The best part of this movie is a tremendous action scene that I love.  It involves a motorcycle chase down the streets of Saigon.  Both Bond and Wei (Yeoh) are handcuffed together on the bike, outrunning cars and a helicopter.  They drive everywhere - on tops of building and through them.  The best part of the chase is when the helicopter turns vertical, using its blades to tear up everything down the street.  People are running while the chopper chases down the bike in the crowd.  Its quite amazing to see a chopper in that position.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great Bond film.  Not the best, but one of the better.  It won't go down with the classics, but it has some fun characters, an original story, and some great action to keep it very entertaining.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4.5endous action scene that I love.

B000QQFKYE|3.0|I have to confess to disappointment with this latest offering by David Lynch. There's a strong beginning of mystery, intrigue and danger. A strange neighbor with an Eastern European accent shows up at Laura Dern's mansion and tells her threatening stories, predicting dire events and suggesting that the past, present and future will be confused (which then happens). But at a certain point Lynch loses control of the story, as he does in other films. David Lynch is certainly an artist. His films are a unique kind of beautiful nightmare. But \\"Inland Empire\\" shows a lack of discipline in editing. It is a very long movie with too many superfluous scenes.     Fans of David Lynch will enjoy trying to make sense of the confusion of identities, times and places; others will lose patience. Is Laura Dern the Hollywood actress, the woman with a Southern accent having an affair with Justin Theroux, the woman living in a low-rent neighborhood of Inland Southern California, or a prostitute on Hollywood Boulevard? (For a true stranger-than-fiction account of life in the real Inland Empire, read Gary Kern's memoir of life in Riverside, California, \\"Letters from Dwight.\\"). My favorite moments are when Lynch pokes fun (?) at the evil inherent in Hollywood. He makes a point of having Laura Dern murdered near the corner of Hollywood and Vine; sinister music plays as the camera pans over the famous \\"Hollywood\\" sign. Southern California has never been creepier.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|Much can be said about today's artists and the assembly-line fashion in which they are produced, packaged and marketed.  Thankfully, Beyonce is not from that mold. The test of any great musical performer is how well their performance can hold up on in front of a live audience, away from the safety of music video magic.  The Beyonce Experience is one of those rare live performances where if you weren't convinced of the hype surrounding an artist beforehand -- you will be afterwards.<br /><br />I saw this concert live in Chicago, IL and it was wonderful to find this DVD; it captures every moment of that amazing concert experience. Unlike other concert DVD's being released this week where the show relies heavily on stage production and quick edits to hide to weakness of the performance, The Beyonce Experience is one of those rare concert DVD's that put you right in the experience (sorry Justin Timberlake).<br /><br />From the opening in which Beyonce asks her Los Angeles audience, \\"...are you ready to be entertainnnnnneeeddd!!!,\\" The Beyonce Experience is a magnum opus of all the great work she's compiled throughout the years as lead singer in Destiny's Child to her present solo efforts.  Although brief, this concert DVD features brief guest appearances by Jay-Z, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.  Beyonce brings the heat with every track with exceptional performances on: Crazy in Love, Flaw's N All, Irreplaceable, Jumpin' Jumpin' and Soldier.  Even the interludes by her all female band and her dance troupe are crowd pleasers.<br /><br />The DVD's filmed in a beautiful 1.78:1 aspect ratio so if you have a 16:9 widescreen television (or digital projector in my case) it fills your screen completely (no letterboxing).  The Dolby 5.1 sound substantially captures her vocals, the music and the crowd's excitement.  Running at a lengthy two hours and ten minutes, for the price this is hands down one of the best concert experience any artist has ever offered.  A must for any music fan.music fan.

B00006WKY9|5.0|I've loved this album for 30 years, and now that it's re-mastered with two bonus tracks, it's just the cream of the original first 5 studio albums!  It sounds better than ever!  I would have preferred the sequence of the tracks to have been originally rearranged, but that's no matter.  Turn it up loud; read the lyrics!  Highly recommended!  I wonder why they did away with the original cover art on this one?  And, what is the full/long version of Sails of Charon?  It's 4.24 here.  Is there an 'extended mix'? *lol*
B000VNMMQG|3.0|I enjoyed the movie. The historical sets were great. The acting was very good. The dialogs had a ring of truth. The love story, although it was a minor part of the movie, was done well. The story needed to be told and the movie told it well. One of the bad points was the movie jumped around in Wilberforce's life quite a bit. Following the time shifts was confusing at times. As the movie went along, the plot was easier to follow.<br /><br />I read a short biography of Wilberforce and I heard a talk on Newton. I can't claim any expertise on these men, but what little I know of them made me question the movie's historical accuracy. Newton had a congregation. He was not a hermit mopping up a church. He was a popular Anglican preacher. Finney did a great job in the part, but I don't think it represented Newton very well. Wouldn't a better charactorization have been a more historic portrayal of Newton who was a slave trader that became a slave of Christ by serving and preaching to all? Rather than a guilt-ridden old man?<br /><br />I also wished the movie spent more time on Wilberforce's conversion and beliefs. Wilberforce was a thoughtful Christian who wrote books on what he believed. Wilberforce's stamina according to Wilberforce was his reformed faith. The movie just had him studying nature in a worshipful manner in his garden.<br /><br />In summary, I liked the movie and I enjoyed it. The message needed to be told and it was told well. How England avoided a bloody civil war because of this issue and resolved the issues through a peaceful process was instructive. However, Wilberforce and Newton deserved to have a more accurate portrayal of their lives.
0446310786|5.0|Having read this book many years ago, I reread it before reading the book, \\"Mockingbird\\".  If you liked \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" then by all means read \\"Mockingbird\\", which is a story about Lee Harper, the author of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".  \\"Mockingbird\\" tells of Lee Harper, her one book career, her friendship with Truman Capote, and her role in helping him write \\"In Cold Blood\\".  It also shows how she wrote Truman Capote as a child into her book.  You'll want to read both books.
B000GW8OAA|5.0|Is this on par with Gone with the Wind or The African Queen.  No, obviously not, but it is a great car movie.  If you enjoy cars and like the street racing scene then this movie is for you.  There are classic movies which are timeless and then there are movies which are just darn fun.  This movie is the latter of the two.

B000062X9B|5.0|What a terrific album! Of course, you already know that Johnny Cash was one of the all-time giants in music history. He's become an icon (to such an extent it actually bothers me, I feel it trivializes his greatness in a way).  This album is superb; it makes even a post-80's song by U2 sound great! (sorry, I hate Bono, he's everywhere claiming EVERBODY was his BIGGEST influence when he was \\"a wee lad'!)  I Won't Back Down -- I got this CD just from the brief snippet about it in Tom Petty's documentary, Runnin' Down A Dream -- and MAN, it is INCREDIBLE. The first time I heard it on this CD I was completely in tears. Completely majestic. (Yes, it's better than Tom Petty's original, which is saying something.)  Solitary Man is great, never heard the original; I ain't too crazy about Neil Diamond--that's what is so great about this album -- if you don't like the original artists too much, you'll forget ALL about them due to Johnny! Great lyrics, I agree with them.  I listened to this a whole bunch this past week or two, and feeling exhausted at times, can completely relate to That Lucky Old Sun. Beautiful singing (I mean especially so on here).  Other highlights are Before My Time, a beautiful love song; Wayfaring Stranger, which I've heard by others but this is the best version I've heard; The Mercy Seat, which I ain't sure bests Nick Cave's original,which is more intense (hell, it's Nick Cave's BEST song! Sure, he's overrated, pretentious -- not nearly as much as Bono -- he's obviously no Johnny Cash -- but on that one, the original is superior I feel. MAYBE.) Country Trash and I'm Leavin' Now are also great.    But--after I Won't Back Down-- my favorite song on here is Nobody.    GREAT! A lament with humor, and one that anybody who's getting unheard or ignored by certain friends will find a great release and laugh from this song.  A perfect song for the holidays if you're lonely, ya ain't rich and you don't have a giant family and tons of friends all around. Christmas SUCKS!!!     IT'S GREAT FUN TO SING ALONG TO ALSO!    Just a terrific album. Bless you Johnny.

B0000009SE|5.0|god, in my 20's I used to listen to this album so much!<br /><br />Ever the musical genius, Zappa shows us here how he treats jazz.  Although at first hearing, it seems scrambled and jambled, every note of this masterpiece was written down and performed with precision.<br /><br />Zappa shows us that one needs no chemical drugs to enter a \\"stoned\\" frame of mind.  Just listen to this album, and appreciate Zappa's \\"Conceptual continuity.\\"<br /><br />anu Zappa fan probably will also be a Residents fan.  Both know how to make comedic music with no words being spoken!  Spike Jones would have been proud of Zappa and Waka Jawaka turns jazz on it's ear!

When we changed our old stereo system this year, we now no longer have the cassette player - so I ordered this combo album.

There simply is no finer single Christmas Collection out there.  Perfect.
B0007PALZ2|4.0|As far as I am concerned, both Bruce Willis (in one of his first non-action hero movies) and Brad Pitt (Oscar nominated here) turned in their finest work to date under Terry Gilliam for \\"Twelve Monkeys.\\" Set in shifting time frames (from the first world war to a post-apocalyptic 2035), Willis is trying to capture a virus that wiped out most of civilization and drove the survivors underground. Gilliam makes the future with the same hallucinogenic fervor that made his [[ASIN:B000G8NXZA Brazil]] a classic, especially the snow-covered Philadelphia where Willis encounters a lion in front of Wanamaker's.<br /><br />Pitt, as a deranged mental patient turned potential terrorist scene steals whenever he is on-screen (think of a more restrained Tyler Durden from [[ASIN:B000067J1H Fight Club]]), and he plays a pivotal role in leading Willis to the source of the infections. Madeline Stowe is terrific as the Psychiatrist who forms a bond with Willis, slowly coming to the realization that all her training has left her unprepared for what the future may have in store.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, there are imaginative uses of character and background, making Philadelphia the ground zero of the virus. Again, Gilliam's trademark visuals add so much to the film that \\"12 Monkeys\\" pushes itself above the usual time-travel and End of The World Science Fiction. It's a move that I have often gone back to for repeat viewings, and one that the current CGI-infatuated crowds could take a few pointers from.
B00005JPS9|3.0|In my personal opinion this film represents Robert Zemeckis at his low, which isn't necceserily a bad thing but after releasing films like back to the future, Who framed roger rabit and Forrest gump it puts this film at a high expectation. Dont get me wrong i thought the animation for the film was brilliant and really quite nice to look at, the best for this time in fact and the story flows with some well written dialogue which gave me as an audience a real sence of what fantasy is all about. It flowed accross to me much like a poem.<br /><br />This film had a lot of potential in terms of story. When the movie started off i was quite excited for about what was about to playout over this story, but the film came out to be really rather plotless. It would start from one plot and then would feal like it had skipped plotpoints which i would like to have seen play out. Like it seemed to come to a halfway point in the story and instead of dwelve into plot, just send us to the end of the tale and have the rather interesting story end. i wont dvelve into further detail because i wouldnt want to give anything away about the story itself =).<br />After having written this, i still recommend this to animation and fantasy lovers, because it was quite a nice film to look at, although you will leave the film fealing a little empty.
0142406112|5.0|This summer, I was looking for books to add to my classroom library that might entice one of my returning students who LOVES football and HATES reading. The Alex Rider series caught my eye because I had enjoyed watching the BBC TV series \\"Foyle's War,\\" which was also written by Anthony Horowitz. It worked! The student is already on the third novel of the series. Sometimes it is just finding the right genre. The Alex Rider books are \\"spy\\" novels, but Horowitz portrays his protagonist very three-dimensionally with some great \\"Man (or in this case, Boy) vs. Self\\" dramatic conflict, which we teachers love to see kids reading and writing about. I read the whole series myself this summer and was delighted to find there are still more being written.    Addendum - \\"Alex\\" is now being read by four of my non-reading boys. One of them* has NEVER completed an outside reading requirement in the three years that he's been a student of mine. UPDATE 7/08: *He completed the reading requirement, did the report, graduated (yay!), and asked his mom to buy him the rest of the series so that he could read them over the summer!
B000HZ0FEY|1.0|I tried to read this book twice for High School English, and both times I could get no farther than the 9th chapter.  It is supposed to be this great romantic suspense novel, and yet there was no romance or suspense whatsoever.  Instead there was a creepy old house and an evil housekeeper, and maybe if it was written by Stephen King it would be as good as it sounds.
0375842209|5.0|I loved this book from the first chapter. AS an adult reader, I was intrigued by the name and short description of the plot in a teacher's magazine. I picked up the book locally and dove in. The unique writing style and perspective keeps you on the edge of the page wanting to read the book in one sitting (not recommended as it is a good size book, though nothing on the final Harry Potter book sizes). It is heart-felt, emotionally written and I had to reach for the tissue box more than once! I recommend this to anyone who is looking to read about WWII from a different perspective. A good read for 12 years and up.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is one of my favorite animated movies of all time.  I saw this in the movie theatre with my 4-year-old grandson, and we both loved it.  The humor in this movie will appeal to children of all ages.  In the days of Top Chef and the Food Network, the cooking theme is timely and the terminology appropriate, and yet not over the heads of the younger children.  Even the teenagers in our house enjoyed this movie, which is saying a lot.  As with most animated movies, you will enjoy watching it again, and again, and again. . .
B000P0J02E|5.0|This review is late in coming, but the fact is it's hard to find words to describe Hans Zimmer's work for \\"At Worlds End.\\"  Zimmer has developed old themes, created new ones, and used his \\"trademark\\" Zimmer orchestration to produce one of the best film scores that has ever existed.    Much of the music from \\"At World's End\\" is from the previous two movies.  Whether it is Jack's theme or simply the three ascending notes heard in the final scene of \\"Dead Man's Chest\\", Zimmer has not only utilized but expanded on the past music, bringing it to yet another higher level.  His variations on different themes not only keep the music new and fresh, but are also arguably better than the original themes themselves.    Zimmer has also created many new themes.  The theme introduced in \\"Up Is Down\\" is so epic it will leave you speechless.  The love theme first heard in \\"At Wit's End\\" is hard to describe.  The best word I can come up with is \\"sweeping.\\"  It's broad, deep, and very effective at drawing the listener into the music.  And then there is \\"Hoist The Colors\\".  First played as a dreary death march, it is later transformed into a stirring anthem.  These new themes are one of the best parts of the soundtrack.    Finally, all of this is done in Zimmer's classic style.  I am no composer, but when I listen to Zimmer I know he must be doing something right.    My favorite tracks are \\"Singapore\\", \\"At Wit's End\\", \\"Up Is Down\\", \\"What Shall We Die For\\", \\"I Don't Think Now Is The Best Time\\", and \\"Drink Up Me Hearties\\".    Despite the great score I didn't like the movie.  Hans Zimmer spoiled Jerry Bruckheimer and Gore Verbinski with his great work.  Too bad their work couldn't match it.

B000003BF1|5.0|With this album the Stones grabbed that title and effortlessly held the title until sometime after the release of Exile On Main Street. A supreme mix of of blues influenced rock music with a bit of country and the frankly really oddball, but magically catchy \\"You Can't Alway get What You Want\\".<br /><br />The album starts with one of the Stones best ever tracks \\"Gimme Shelter\\", which is nearly four and a half minutes long. The influence of Chuck Berry can still be heard on this track but the Stones have moved the goal posts and although Chuck invented some of the greatest Rock N Roll guitar licks, on Gimme Shelter Keith Richards raises the bar.<br /><br />Following the slow Robert Johnson blues \\"Love in Vain\\" (superb) and the country rewrite of \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\" that is \\"Country Honk\\" (probably the weakest track) we get to \\"Live With Me\\". Heres a track that could easily have been on Exile on Main Street.

0446577391|5.0|David Baldacci may be the most verstile auther I have read.  His facts are always impeccable and his plots are fantastic.  This story will keep you reading at the expense of all those things you wanted to do.  It is terrific!
B00006AW2G|5.0|With this album the Stones grabbed that title and effortlessly held the title until sometime after the release of Exile On Main Street. A supreme mix of of blues influenced rock music with a bit of country and the frankly really oddball, but magically catchy \\"You Can't Alway get What You Want\\".<br /><br />The album starts with one of the Stones best ever tracks \\"Gimme Shelter\\", which is nearly four and a half minutes long. The influence of Chuck Berry can still be heard on this track but the Stones have moved the goal posts and although Chuck invented some of the greatest Rock N Roll guitar licks, on Gimme Shelter Keith Richards raises the bar.<br /><br />Following the slow Robert Johnson blues \\"Love in Vain\\" (superb) and the country rewrite of \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\" that is \\"Country Honk\\" (probably the weakest track) we get to \\"Live With Me\\". Heres a track that could easily have been on Exile on Main Street. A supreme piece of Rock Music, Jagger snarls the lyrics, a barnstorming Sax solo by Bobby Keys, the twin Pianos of Nicky Hopkins and Leon Russell pounding in the background.

B0000028VT|4.0|I liked this album very much when it was released.  After listening to it, it very much grew on me.  Every once in a while I would find a different song that would speak to me.  I found all the songs, without exception, to be beautiful.  It's definitively a classy album, and a great representation of the early 90s.  Some people commented that this album doesn't have much variety, that all the songs sound pretty much the same.  I have a great appreciation for this.  This CD puts you in a specific mood, and it doesn't ruin it for you in the middle.  If you are over the 90s type of production (crispy sounds), it's unlikely you'll appreciate this album.  I'm definitively over this album now.  Sound production matures from year to year, plus older people are less likely to appreciate crispy sounds than kids and teenagers.  Thus, for this, physical, reason you may not experience the complexity of this music.  Listen to the samples and you'll know if you can take it.
0440238609|5.0|Only read the first book so far.  Great story. Don't let the church people stop you from reading this book.  I'm sure the cloud man would not punish anybody for simply keeping an open mind. Good begining, great middle, and great ending will keep you reading all night.  I'm looking forward to reading the next two books and seeing the movie.
B000JO9Y6I|5.0|I really enjoyed the pilot episode. It's a new twist on the crime genre. Looking forward to seeing the next episode.
B000Q9IZ5C|2.0|Don't bother with the Firefly film; it's a piece of floating space debris in comparison to the TV series. All the elements that made the series interesting such as the dialogue, humor and character interaction and evolution have been thrown off the ship and what's left blown up (literally) into an archetypal Sci-Fi B movie. If you've spent too much time watching the series then this movie is the antidote that will cure you of any curiosity. This is one only the fan boys (who I see mindlessly mark down any negative review here) could love.
1400063515|4.0|I admit that this book won't win any writing prizes, but I still found it enjoyable and thought-provoking.  It is an excellent antidote to the \\"blue ocean, search for excellence, how I brilliantly predicted the future and became rich\\" line of books.  I think some reviewers were disappointed because of their expectations.  \\"The Black Swan\\" is not exactly a \\"pop philosophy\\" or business book.  It isn't a scholarly treatise for Ph.D. consumption, either.  That hybrid nature may be the reason for the uneven writing.<br />Regardless, I found the thinking fresh and clear with applications to real life included.  I recommend it highly for decision-makers of all kinds.
0446310786|5.0|I believe the greatest elements in this book are its good, decent, praiseworthy characters. Harper Lee creates a time and place where each character is flawed and fallible, yet her work lifts the reader to a more noble and lovely view of our world. Atticus Finch is a believably moral man with lofty principles, yet we see his hesitations and stumblings as a father and public defender. Scout, Atticus' daughter, and Jem, his son, act out in youthful fits of rage and misunderstanding, yet the deep love and unbounded admiration they feel for their father is heartwarming.     The fact that Lee weaves threads of race and human rights and class distinction so skillfully into this tale is partly why I believe this book is such a beloved classic. Atticus is a single white father raising his two children with the help of a black housekeeper in Alabama during the 1930s. As Lee unfolds the family's story, we as readers are allowed to step back in time and possibly begin to understand what life may have been like from the perspective of young and old, black and white, and the poor and privileged. In the latter half of the book, Atticus is called upon to legally defend a black man for allegedly raping a white woman, and the trials he and his family suffer as a result make this book sing with conflict and weighty moral decisions.    Furthermore, I very much liked Lee's folksy and funny and frequently beautiful language and her skill in penning creative and insightful sentences of high literary value.     Recently I read or heard somewhere that Atticus Finch was determined from the results of a vast survey to be one of the most revered fictional characters in literature. In my opinion, Lee's Atticus deserves that distinction. I give this book my highest recommendation.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|I think, like a lot of people, when Radiohead announced that they were putting out their seventh proper album, \\"In Rainbows\\", on their website for a choose your own price payment method I was immediatly intrigued. Even though I hadn't loved a Radiohead record since \\"OK Computer\\"--- I liked \\"Kid A\\", hated \\"Amnesiac\\" and was bored by the majority of \\"Hail to the Thief\\"--- I always held it in the back of my head that they would again make another great album, another stunner, and thought the model seemed kind of cool. So I choose my price (seven dollars if you're curious) and downloaded it the day it came out.<br />So, the marketing and distrubution method out of the way, how is \\"In Rainbows\\"? Well, I can honestly say in all honesty, that this is the best Radiohead record that I have heard since \\"OK Computer\\", even if it isn't exactly great. But it is really good, and that's a welcome surprise.<br />If anything, \\"In Rainbows\\" is a consolidation of the last ten years of Radiohead. There are the more song based arrangements that made up \\"OK Comouter\\", the occasional studio tinkering and droning keyboards that made up \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\", the sprawl of \\"Hail to the Thief, even the intimacy that made Thom Yorke's \\"The Eraser\\" such a good record last year.<br />There are no prolonged experiments on \\"In Rainbows\\". In fact, this in the bands most song orientated record since \\"The Bends\\", and each song that the band has choosen is excellent, from the cool quiet of \\"15 Steps\\", the punk energy of \\"Bodysnatcher\\", the refrained intimacy of \\"Faust Arp\\" and \\"Videotape\\". There isn't a bad song on the record. In fact, every song is excellent, and all have a nice, off-the-cuff feel that has been lacking in Radiohead records recently, even though it's obvious that the band and their producer, Nigel Godrich, have spent much time preparing the songs and what goes into making them.<br />The lyrics are excellent and comprehensible, and the music is well played throughout by the band. If anything, this is Colin Greenwood's album, as the bass on the album thumps and adds to the atmosphere in ways that were hinted at on other Radiohead records, but here really shine.<br />In fact, I have no real complaints about this album at all. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because it isn't as great as \\"The Bends\\" or \\"OK Computer\\", and while it is unfair to judge a record based on what came before it, with a band like Radiohead it's near impossible to do.<br />But regardless, \\"In Rainbows\\" is a very good record, consistant and well written, and is easily one of the best of the year.s Colin Greenwood's album, as the bass on the album thumps and adds to the atmosphere in ways that were hinted at on other Radiohead records, but here really shine.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|The producers have taken to this project and it shows. Sure, the show has a few writers and a few directers, but the producers are so deep into the writing themselves that they manage to keep it from losing context and meaning. They don't leave a lot of room for error; greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Michael C. Hall is a wonder. I hated his film debut in \\"Paycheck,\\" as his perfomance was rather weak, but he is quite impressive here. I enjoy watching him.<br /><br />Also, the cast is phenomenal; not a dud to be found. Erik King is magnificent as Doakes, albeit occasionally prototypical. His intensity is awesome. You'd be hard pressed to find an unintelligently written/translated character on here.<br /><br />Highly recommended, even if you hate outlandish plot twists.
B0009MAO46|5.0|It came quickly it's in great condition and it more than satisfied my desire to see/own toy story.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Although I was quite small when first I saw Dumbo, I well remember the impressions it left me: crows singing (and a nice job of it, too) about butterflies, house flies and elephant flies; clowns acting in goofy and potentially dangerous ways; mean matronly elephants shunning a baby; knots coming inexplicably apart when babies landed by their intended parents; \\"pink elephants on parade\\" (raised in a mercifully moderate-drinking household, I just went along with the notion too much drink did odd things to us).  Seeing this version carefully applied to DVD is a delight all over again. Sometimes analog to digital suffers in transition: not so in this case. All the artistry, free-wheeling fun and pathos is sharpened and brightened in this DVD, which offers plenty of sidelights for the curious or enthralled. Well worth owning and re-visiting.
0446577391|5.0|Stone Cold  Written by: David Baldacci  Published by: Grand Central Publishing  ISBN: 978-0-446-57739-7    \\"More of the Camel Club\\"  Reviewed by: Stephanie Rollins for ReviewYourBook.com  5 stars    I have never read a Camel Club book. I have read Baldacci's \\"The Christmas Train\\". That was a good book, so I was excited to delve into \\"Stone Cold\\". The beginning was difficult, because I was unaware of the characters and their history. Baldacci tried to weave some explanation of the characters in the first few pages without interrupting the plot.    Though, I had to learn each character, it was worth it. It is not a quick read; \\"Stone Cold\\" has many twists and turns. Nothing is as it seems. Will all of the Camel Club survive this battle? Read and find out. I recommend reading all the Camel Club books in order. Put that on your Christmas list.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I just love Garth Brooks Music... And the greatest hits, Brings back a lot of memories.     Thanks,  Dean
B000V1MMLI|4.0|I'm actually quite pleased with how the project turned out. I do have to appreciate Serj's interpretation of music. Grant it, I won't give the album 5 stars because I do feel as though some of the intros were similar. Other than that, fabulous job!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|What can I say! Just a GREAT GREAT MOVIE! I took my four year old daughter to see this movie and we were totally entertained. Disney/Pixar leap back into the wonderful storytelling where the critters are the main characters and the humans are secondary yet necessary. As soon as Ratatouille was announced on Amazon for Pre-Order, you think I clicked that button, YOU BET!<br /><br />How many times have my child and I watched this movie, I think I have lost count *LOL* but Ratatouille is definitely something you should put under the tree this year or just to add to your permanent DVD collection...<br /><br />And remember as my daughter constantly reminds me now \\"anyone can cook!\\"
055357342X|2.0|When this book first came out Martin had to put out a letter explaining that he had to chop it down to half the characters because it would have been too big. He said to expect the rest in six months.  HOGWASH! Where is the rest of it? Just like Robert Jordan and his \\"Wheel of Time\\" series, this story got away from Martin and we may never see the end.
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|Britney's new CD is a good one, full of dance songs, stuff great for a party, but all of the songs tend to sound the same after a while.  I bought it because I was curious, and I don't regret the purchase, but I don't listen to it over and over and over, like I do with some of the other CDs I own.

Tremendously compared with another deck I've bought on a local on-line shop last month.
0451526279|1.0|Please don't misunderstand me:  I love Jane Austen's Emma.  I love everything by Jane Austen.  What I don't love about this edition of the book is the introduction.  Margaret Drabble obviously doen't care for the book, especially the heroine Emma Woodhouse.  I have no idea why they would publish such an unfavorable introduction with the novel.  Also, if you read the intro but have never read the novel, you're getting the entire plot line, which is only good if you're still in and writting a book report.<br /><br />But, if you're just looking for a cheap copy of Emma, then by all means, buy this version.  Just please don't dampen the wonderful experience of reading Jane Austen by reading the horrible introduction.
0807262013|5.0|I listened to all three books on cd with my 11 year old daughter.  Of all of the books, we both enjoyed this one the best as this one made the reader (listener) think the most.  It caused us to think about life and death and choices that we make.  While we both did not care for any parts about Mary Malone and the mulefas, the rest of the it was great. My daughter stated that she enjoyed this series of books more than the Harry Potter.     As for the whole thing about anti-God, my daughter did not come away with that at all.  She felt that it was more that people need to make their own choices in life and understand that they need to take responsibility for those choices else.  \\"Who knows,\\" she stated, \\"would you like to have harpies after you all night screaming all the things you did wrong your whole life?\\"    For anyone who has not listened to a book on tape, this would be a great one to do as it is a full cast and the voices are wonderful.  If you have a long road trip, take it with you.
B000Y179KO|5.0|What a great gift; a new Eagles CD after what seems like an eternity. I'm not sure why anyone with good musical taste would rate this CD anything less than a 5 with the exception of someone who hadn't listened to it enough. This CD took a good 5 or 6 listenings to really hear the music and to fully appreciate this music. I would highly recomend you burn the music and listen to it on your Ipod and headphones as the detail will come through. The 2nd CD is better than the first with the title track probably my favorite and a departure from the past. You gotta buy this music and give it a few listens before forming an opinion! Once you've given it some time I'm sure you'll agree that this CD will be a classic for years to come. Bring on the tour boys!!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|At the heart of daily life under the sway of Soviet rule were lies. When the wrong joke could land one in prison or the gulag, the risks of free expression made normal human interactions and exchanges extremely dangerous. As a result, people resorted to coded language, euphemism, and perhaps most commonly the avoidance of topics. Telling the truth was frequently not an option. Anyone who spent any time in Russia or eastern Europe before 1989 realized this in short order.     The Lives of Others, by focusing on a small group of artists involved with the theater and their state-security antagonists, who monitor their every act--what they write, what they say, whom they visit, whom they love, what they think--reveals the absolute corruption of the communist system. It also reveals the heavy penalties paid by those who made any attempt to fight back, or who simply found themselves caught up in a maelstrom not of their own making. Some made it to the end, when the Wall came down; for others, loss of work and attendant poverty, imprisonment, and suicide were the outcome.    This film will be the standard against which all others on the destructiveness of communism to average lives must be measured in the future. Outstanding writing, outstanding acting, outstanding direction. A movie for all time.
B000O1799U|5.0|I am probably one of the last people in the U.S. to see the movie DreamGirls. I watched it yesterday on DVD. And I am telling you . . . if you are human, still have a beating heart with any appreciation of music, when Jennifer Hudson sings her two leading songs (\\"And I Am Telling You\\" and \\"I Am Changing\\"), she will bring you to your knees - if not literally - then emotionally. Wow! Quality, production, cast and content are off the charts. I sat spellbound and I am not typically a fan of musicals. I am more geared toward mysteries and suspense, but I am changing . . . because DreamGirls is probably hands down the best movie I have ever seen!
B0000027RL|5.0|I am a fan of just about every kind of music on the planet. I have well over a thousand CDs in my collection and this one stands tall among them. Put simply, few albums in your life will move you as much as this one will. Black, Jeremy, Once, Alive, Evenflow, Release, this is as good as it gets. At its best moments it transcends music and becomes an experience. I say without any bias, this album is The Best of its kind.
B000Y179KO|3.0|Not a bad album at all but how could it take 28 years to come about.<br />For 28 years this should be the greatest album they ever made, and sadly it is not.<br />Don't get me wrong, the songs which are great, are truly great but there is a lot of filler which the EAGLES never had before.<br />Their albums were always records you could put on and play from front to back, and this is far from that.<br />They show their age in how much they've slowed down, with the single just being a flat-out \\"country song\\",  not \\"country-rock\\" like they have always been known for.<br />The rest is just pretty much Adult-contemporary which tends to get boring...if you are looking for a rockin' EAGLES album this is certainly not the one.<br />Their quest to better the classic HOTEL CALIFORNIA is once again thwarted just like THE LONG RUN didn't cut it either, although LONG RUN was a much better record than this.  It was a bit of a let down for me as I looked forward to this album's release for over a year.
B000TENE6Y|2.0|Got this cd because of one song \\"Karma Police\\". I love this song, the others are not really my taste. Preview the songs before you decide to download the whole album - you may love the whole thing, and if not you can download single songs.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|There are some movies you watch because it gets great review, and you really expect you're in for one of those powerful, awe-inspiring movies. You expect to come out of the theater with the warm and fuzzy feeling. Instead, I left the theater a bit depressed, and were it not for the strong characterizations and amazing actors, I probably would have rated this movie a lot lower.<br /><br />Of course Abigail Breslin was wonderful, and I'm sure, will prove to be a very powerful actress as she grows. I wasn't so impressed with Steve Carrell or Greg Kinnear as some of the jokes quickly grew stale, and the dialogue was delivered in a less than intriguing manner.<br /><br />However, even with the ending being a bit too contrived, the movie is a character-driven story with some strong acting coming from the two youngest actors in the movie.<br /><br />Perhaps worth a rental, but it's not one I'd keep on my personal movie shelf.
1594489505|3.0|a very average follow up to the Kite Runner, this story just didn't bring you into it's folds, didn't invoke any feeling from the reader, and in my opinion, really went nowhere.  there are other, better books out there...this one is getting way too much hype.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|Any fan of golden age science fiction will appreciate the concept of this movie.  An evil genius, big machines with rivets, robots, a quirky sidekick and a romantic interest make this a cookie cutter plot of the H.G. Wells era of science fiction.  Visually, this movie is spectacular and it has brought life to classic fantasies of how the future world looked like to the people of the industrial revolution.    Unfortunately the movie falls flat in execution.  The actors, normally dependable, are detached and disinterested in the world around them.  I would describe the performances as \\"lazy.\\"  It was as if Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and (Male Lead) were stuck on a boring carnival ride and couldn't wait for the ending so they could go home.    This movie might be an important milestone in cinematic technology.  It was the first (insert research here).  However, it is simply impossible to ignore the weak plot and sleepy acting.  This movie is a definite skip.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Lucas had to tinker with the best sci fi series ever made. Sure it is his right and privilege because they are his movies, but i think his piddling made them a bit worse. Some of the new graphical changes were good but some just look out of place such as the young Anakin Skywalker at the End of Return of the Jedi. Great Series if only it had been left alone! However, its now on dvd and that is something to be thankful for.
B000069CWE|3.0|This Linkin Park Remix album....might have been better off, not being released.  It is not worthwhile owning, unless you are a die hard linkin fan.<br />Of course its not all bad, there are a few decent tracks...but on the whole...it gets a 3/5
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I loved this movie. It showed how faith in God and Jesus can inspire the goodness in people. William Wilberforce (a powerful Ioan Gruffudd), the movie's protagonist, progressively used a combination of faith and activism to abolish the British slave trade against the odds. Albert Finney is excellent as a former slave ship captain who repented his slave-trading past, converted to evangelical Christianity, joined forces with Wilberforce, and wrote the timeless hymn, Amazing Grace. The performances are strong all around. The historical drama sweeps along as we follow Wilberforce's passionate efforts to abolish the inhumane institution of slavery. I also found it refreshing that the movie was pretty clean, with only mild profanity and no graphic violence or sex.
B000X3VN46|5.0|It's not a coincidence that former Nightwish lead singer Tarja has released her solo album at almost the same time at Nightwish has released Dark Passion Play with their new singer.    My Winter Storm is a far stronger CD than the Dark Passion Play, in which I was very disappointed. Where DPP started strong and fell apart halfway through, MWS moves from one fantastic track to the next. A perfect balance of the softer and harder songs at which Tarja excels.     I Walk Alone is a great lead off track. Boy and the Ghost is another favorite of mine. Ciaran's Well rocks as hard as anything she did with Nightwish. Damned Vampires & Gothic Divine may be my favorite. A very full CD of over 75 minutes, there never a dull moment.     If you have to choose between two pricey imports, Nightwish's Dark Passion Play and Tarja's My Winter Storm, choose Tarja. You Won't be disappointed.

B000065BPB|3.0|This is a great headphone, very good voice quality. It is very good for listening classic music. Sounds are clear, transparent and crystal. But I have to rate it 3 stars--I wear glasses, and have a little big head. It is too tight to me. I even have headache with it, real headache. If I wear glasses with the phone, I can't move my head. Any move will cause huge noise.    I have a Seinnheiser  PX100 too. I feel much more comfortable with the cheaper one, even though the sound quality is not as good as this \\"Pro\\" headphone.
0143038419|2.0|Quite simply, as a writer myself, I think it is clear that Liz Gilbert fictionalized the events of her year spent abroad in order to tie neat bows of resolution into each section.  As any writer knows - reality does not occur in narrative packages with a clear beginning, middle and satisfying end.  That only occurs in the difficult process of creating that structure to satisfy the drive for narrative pleasure that we humans all seem to have.  If this was not a difficult task, then many more people could be successful writers than there are.  The fact that Ms. Gilbert's book has more narrative structure and satisfying conclusions that occur in clear chapters, that she seems to accomplish every goal that she sets out, that she is surrounded by apparent magic and a universe that seems to want to grant her every wish and need with guides, and poetry and perfect experiences of awakening: i.e. a year of complete and wonderful syncronity - smacks of extraordinary dishonesty.  Life might work like this in romantic movies (and quite frankly rarely does to  *this* degree) or in Harry Potter books (not to criticize those books - but they are fantasy fulfillment of magic and personal specialness) - but tell me of one person whose life *in reality* is so special and so magical that it works out in so many perfectly tied up bows.  God must love her much more than the rest of humanity if she was prepaid to write a book on her experiences and they just so happened to work out in such a narratively and emotionally satisfying fashion.    It is especially blessed for her publisher as well, who certainly saw the financial opportunity of writing about the joys of food, spirituality, balance, healing and romance: as these are currently the topics of most of the top selling \\"nonfiction\\" books these days.  What would have happened if Ms. Gilbert did not have success in all of these areas that she was prepaid to write about?  Certainly a disappointing return for the  publisher.  And given the necessity of there being a happy ending to such a search for any \\"inspirational\\" book to be successful (which clearly this was meant to be from the get-go: she certainly couldn't come back from this year as confused and broken-hearted as she left) - I don't see how her editors would have accepted anything less from their investment in her journey.    Finally, Ms. Gilbert's years of magazine writing at such popular and PR driven rags as GQ and Spin mean that she was quite skilled at turning any interview or experience into a romanticized view that would \\"sell\\" to an audience.  It isn't like they were the New Yorker or The Atlantic.  I have read many an article in those magazines about people I actually have worked with or know personally, and never have I found them to be something other than fawning - even in their moments of \\"criticism\\" of the artist.    Sorry - I only finished the book out of my continued fascination and curiosity with how far she would push this \\"God loves me so much that he made everything work out perfectly for me in the end, at every moment and in all areas of my quest and in every way that I needed.\\"  Can you name someone else this has ever happened to in your life?  If so, than I'd be interested in hearing their story, because hopefully it would not smack of such fabrication and flat out hokum.    Was amusing though.  As it would have to be in order to enchant (i.e. sell).
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Best CD I own. Every song is a good one and it has over 20 songs on it. I take it everywhere with me and listen to it over and over. Never get tired of it.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This is without question, one of the top Hard Rock albums of the 21st Century.  Nearly every song on the album is good.  While Three Days Grace's debut album was excellent, this album takes it to a whole new level.  It's taken me about a year and a half to finally write this review, but after all of that time, I can still say without a shadow of a doubt, this album is a classic.  It wouldn't be all that big of a stretch to say it's in the Top 100 Hard Rock albums of all-time.  In fact, if I had a vote, I would definitely put it in.  Perhaps 10 years from now, this album will get the recognition it deserves.  As for now, if you don't own a copy, please do yourself a tremendous favor and pick it up.  My girlfriend, who only likes R&B and Pop music, even thinks this CD is great.  Proof right there! :)
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Due to the hidden stories behind, the \\"original\\" - so to say - to my mind at least, didn't receive the appropriate or mature treatment that it had deserved back then. Of course since John's death, the pure treatment of the Fab Four to this - or any other of their work - has for ever become impossible. However, this version of the album gives me the impression of a much more \\"raw\\" and \\"live\\" atmosphere. \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" are of course very obvious, but the track that hit me the most is \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" with the can't be unnoticed \\"groove\\" in the air. So many \\"What if ~\\"s come into my mind, but sadly, what is done is done. As someone who grew up listening to them since the age of eleven, I'm very happy that this album was able to be given the light after all these years. Sure, had all four been still alive or had they participated together in the original mix, we would have been listening to neither versions today - the original or this.
B000W4KT64|4.0|Let me say, first off, that I'm not the typical kind of person who would watch thing kind of movie.  I don't care for musicals or plays, so I didn't know what to expect before I began this movie.  With that said, I found it to be highly entertaining, and fun throughout the entire film.  The girl who played the main character (the name escapes me) was outstanding.  John Travolta as a woman was humorous, but believable.  Great cast, fun songs, all together a very fun movie.
0780626966|5.0|\\"Welcome to Prime Time...!\\"  The first is great, 2cd prolly sucks the most, third is third best, then the next 3 are worth watching but only because of Freddy, and then the last is just a great movie when you see all of the people that come back, one last time.  The parallels between the last one (Wes Craven's New Nightmare\\") and the 1st is interesting in how they pulled it off.  This is a great series box set because it has everything you could want as a NOES fan!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|In this inspiring story of William Wilberforce and the movement to abolish slavery, we are once again challenged that one man motivated toward good can accomplish much.  Standing for justice in an unjust world is swimming against the tide of current cultural norms at times but the end is sure as long as one stands.  As with so many, there were unfortunate liberties taken with historical fact with this film but the overall affect was true, at least in spirit.  Mr. Wilberforce's faith rings authentic in the film and the results on his life and political views were unmistakable.  The message is loud and clear, good does indeed triumph - at times it seems slow in coming but the end is inevitable when we are firm.<br /><br />The cultural norms of the Mr. Wilberforce's day seem foreign and unthinkable to us today.  One wonders what norms of today will be obvious moral and civil rights issues tomorrow.  Will history record that we were on the right side of those issues or will it find us with a majority that resists what is right?  Each must examine their own conscience.  May we, like Wilberforce, find the courage to be on the side of political right rather than political expediency.  That, I think, is the theme of this important film.
1592533868|5.0|I owned quite a few quilling books and this book is near the top of my list. It has a wide selection of patterns for framed as well for cards. It is a 'must have' book. Well worth the money.
1582701709|4.0|common things that we all know but forget to practice. I'll re-read it over and over to keep on the path.
630460291X|1.0|First off I want to explain that I am reviewing this edition on DVD. I am not rating the story, directing or production. The image quality is as bad or worse as a VHS. The worst part about this DVD is that after about an hour into the movie, you have to eject the disc and turn it over. Yes, the rest of the movie is on the other side. VHS isn't even that bad. Warner Bros is ridiculus for still manufacturing this ancient DVD.
B000HC2LIK|5.0|THe version that came out in what...2006?  Late 2005, which usually gos for around $10 bucks now...Is a stunning visual upgrade from the previous versions. Razor...did I say RAZOR shape compared to previous versions.  I project it on my 80\\" screen with a sanyo plvZ5 projector, and closeups are just as sharp as HD.<br />(I have the Toshiba HD player and various HD films)...S, if you can't afford the Dec 2007 five disc release...this will be a MAJOR upgrade from previous stuff.<br />DOug TRumball...effects man for this and 2001, CLose Encounters, ABC's classic Logo look in the seventies, etc. always created not just great special effects, but things of great beauty.  I wish he was still working in regular film.  HE will probably be interviewed on the five DVD set.
0763631205|5.0|I wanted to do something for my family to bring back the Christmas Sprit of old.  This was just the thing.  The book is wonderful and the art work is excellent!  This is a treasury that can be passed down through the family for years.
B000YAF4OS|4.0|when the film statred, it started over like a normal dull horror film,<br />but as it went into he 2nd act i found myself with my jaw on the floor.<br />as it moves onto the 2nd act it is almost as if the mist is a backdrop.<br />wow this film was great.. overall 4/5... rated R for, Strong/Graphic Violence, and Language.
B000TCEU4Q|2.0|The product seems to be well made, however, it is not compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator.  No matter what program I use to set up the Axis levers, the next time I boot the computer, they have different assignments.  I think that I am moving the throttle, but the flaps go up or down, the view goes outside or something else will happen.  I would hope that some day, the program problems will be corrected.
B00066N8JS|5.0|As everyone else has pointed out this a great album and an absolute NIN classic, but what no one else has mentioned is that this cd was written as a soundtrack for George Lucas' film THX 1138. Start the cd as you see \\"Directed by George Lucas\\" go off the screen and sit back and enjoy the film and c.d with a new perspective. The c.d ends short of the film and that's when you pop in either of the further downward spirals to finish of the film in two different ways.
0060931736|4.0|This book is definitely a unique read. It is not afraid to \\"tell it like it is,\\" you may say. However, I found myself wanting to like the characters, especially Jean Brodie, much more than I actually did. I'm not saying that none of the characters were likeable, but I did have a difficult time feeling any sympathy or compassion for any of them.
B000VBJEEG|1.0|This was an absolutely dreadful movie concept. The idea of a rodent in a restaurant kitchen is repellent beyond all belief. I did see the movie with some very young friends, and they were amused. I was almost ill at the scene where rats are crawling all over the food in the pantry. I quite literally had nightmares for several nights after seeing this film. I hated this movie! You could not Make me see this again, not for love or money.
6301793196|5.0|These are the masters of the genre, hands down!!! And this collection presents their best in composition and delivery. They deserve the reputation and accolade. I wish the sound was a bit more refined and clear. I give it five stars.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|These breath-taking DVDs about Planet Earth capture many rarely seen places and things, presented in such stunning beauty that the experience of watching them is very like the experience of being there, seeing all this magnificence firsthand. There are animals I never expected to see, some nearly extinct, and plants, birds, trees mountains! Too much to describe in mere words! Presented from a first person standpoint with a narrative that describes and comments, but does not overwhelm, a musical theme that does not overpower. I would not have these leave my collection. I have seen them many times, and while I could do without the bits on bugs, I will undoubtedly see them again.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|I must just have bizarre tastes. While everyone else raves about Fake Empire, it still hasn't grabbed me, yet one of my favorites is Guest Room, which nobody else has even mentioned. Anyway, this album is stellar. I was immediately taken by it, and you could be too, if the thought of an evening with nary a distortion pedal or emo scream sounds appealing. Deserves every bit of attention it is getting, and more.    Mistaken for Strangers is not to be missed, nor Slow Show, nor Brainy, a tricky little gem which will lodge itself in your head for days.
B000VECAEO|5.0|Our family loves Seinfeld and were glad to receive this volume for  our collection. The transaction was perfect with no problems. Would  recommend this seller.
B000VSBX34|4.0|OK, not as good as A Hard Day's Night but it's still the beatles when they owned the musical world.  Let's face it folks, the beatles were so far ahead of everyone else musically that it wasn't really fair.  They still manage to have fun and even (barely)create a story line.  Just sit back and relax and have a good time
B000SM7QUC|5.0|He's trying to say this isn't a Motley album, hence his disappointment...    Well, DUH!    This wasn't meant to be a Motley album.  This is a very personal, and poignant, project from someone who's been to hell and back.  That emotion shines through brilliantly with this album.    I've listened to Crue and the like since my heyday back then.  A lot of us who were 'troubled teens' relate to this album, with the knowledge that a little more money, a little more success, a little more excess, and there but for the Grace of God go we.    Is this self-indulgent?  YES!!  Is it self-aggrandizing?  YES!!  And that's how it's supposed to be.    The message from this is that not many people can come back from the brink, but it's POSSIBLE.    As for the modern sound, well, it is 2007, not 1986.  The vocals are incredible, the music is pounding and emotive, quiet and reflective, all at the same time.  And it's that way through the whole album, no throwaways here.    In my honest opinion, this is the BEST rock album, and the most important, to come out since OPERATION MINDCRIME back in the day.    It's got that 'feel' to it.    If you 'get it', get it.  You won't be disappointed.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|Another classic take on the Dickens tale. Michael Caine amazes acting among the Muppets.  A must-watch during the holidays for families and well worth the time for anyone who loves the Dickens story or is a fan of Mr. Caine's work.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|Overall this movie was entertaining if not all that original.  The story follows the adventure of John Constantine (Reeves) who is a modern day excorcist with angst.  Rachel Weisz plays a detective whose psychic sister commits suicide and she and Reeves try to uncover a plot by demons to enter the real world.  The special effects of the film were good and the story was interesting even if it became a little predictable by the end.  Overall a decent action flick in the same vein as Van Helsing.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was a marvelous mini series and it is great to be able to watch it  any time. I also like to see how the series was made. Love it enough  to order a second one to give as a Christmas gift.
031286504X|3.0|I gave \\"I Am Legend\\" 3 stars because it's uniquely different from run of the mill vampire stuff. However, I was disappointed. It's a short story, barely long enough to promote the lead character, and much of the text seemed, to me anyway, unrelated to the storyline - filler if you will. Having suffered through that the story becomes interesting, and then, yes and then - it's over, as in finished, done with, fini. And I truly felt let down. Yes, I read the book but didn't like it. Forget the book - go see the movie; it's really good.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|When I purchased this DVD I had high hopes.  I thought the concert was great especially the lasers, special effects, and screen films. The biggest highlight for me though was when they performed \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" in its entirety.    However I felt some of the bonus material was unnecessary such as the footage from their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which I thought was bland. I also didn't care for Billy Corgan's speech. I also didn't like the footage from \\"Bootlegging The Bootleggers\\".  It was terrible!     Despite these setbacks the rest of the DVD was incredible.  Even without the extras this still would have been a great DVD. Wish Roger was there.
B000PTYP5C|3.0|I believe that Dream Theater is one of the premier bands in the history or rock. However, when I compare a new album I have to compare it to the standard. For Dream Theater the Standard are the first three albums up to Awake. First an open memo to Jordan Rudess: Please refrain on using the stupid western piano sound. It is annoying and it sucks. Forsaken is my favorite song of the album because it flows and is heavy.     I was dissapointed that I spent money on this cd. Buy devil's slingshot clinophobia instead.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|even though this recording does not have my favorite Javier (Chuck Wagner) Phillip Quast is good and the music and the rest of the cast is magic as always. I never get tired of playing it.
B000OV170W|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is an ethically and emotionally stimulating read. It will make you laugh, cry, scream, and think! This is a story about sisters, but the whole family is affected.<br /><br />As you read, it is easy to judge how you might handle the same situation... but the Fitzgerald family doesn't have the courtside advantage of readers. They are living on the edge - medically, emotionally, socially. Time is running out, so the parents make rash decisions that affect everyone... the physically disabled as well as the healthy family members.<br /><br />Anna is the almost hidden star of this show until she hires an attorney (who comes with a service dog and jokes)! Anna was born for a reason - so that her older sister, Kate, could live. Since Anna's birth, she has donated cord blood, bone marrow, and blood for various tests. Now, Kate needs a kidney transplant, and Anna decides to draw the line.<br /><br />The story is well written and draws the reader into the Fitzgerald family. This is a thought-provoking novel filled with unexpected twists and turns... even to the bittersweet end.
B000002J1S|5.0|Before TLLDOB, Genesis had been building towards... something. You can hear it in Foxtrot's \\"Watcher in the Skies\\" and \\"Supper's Ready\\", catch it in \\"The Musical Box\\" off of Nursery Crymes, and sample it in a lesser form in Selling England By the Pound. However, TLLDOB smashes through the preconceptions of what Genesis had built up before it in a ever increasingly solid album discography and gave us something extraordinary. This album takes time and willingness to identify genius. This can be quite hard in our \\"here today\\" mentality of disposible music listening. But given the proper circumstance (a good friend insisting that you have a \\"concerted listen\\") or happenstance, this album will absolutely blow you away.     For any fans of TLLDOB there are three other albums of the work that are perfect extensions of it:  1) \\"Genesis Live @ The Shrine Auditorium 01-24-1975\\". You can easily find this as a web-stream by googling it. The sound quality is 96kbps but it gives you a fair taste of this incredible live performance. Avoid the often recommended \\"Genesis Archive 1967-75 Disc 1&2\\" as these are heavily doctored and cannot provide the authentic experience. A little more effort on the net will yield a 2-disc set that has been remastered to perfection.   2) \\"The Demos Down On Broadway\\". This 2-disc album shows the behind-the-scenes alternate mixes and some purely instrumental takes of the completed works. A nice insight into the final album.  3) \\"The Lamb Lies Down At Progfest '94\\". Kevin Gilbert along with most of the members of his 80's band \\"Giraffe\\" strip down TLLDOB to more basic rock elements, shorten the timeframe to just over 1 hour, and crush all expectation with this interpretation of the work. It's no wonder that Gilbert was being considered as the replacement frontman for Genesis during the mid-90's before his untimely death.     Finally, if you are ever lucky enough to see the recreation of TLLDOB by \\"The Musical Box\\", a cover-band from Montreal, run don't walk. PG himself has licensed the entire act and all of its visual art rock proclivities. The lead singer, Denis Gagne does a near-flawless PG and the rest of the band are up to the challenge. You would be hard pressed not to actually see Genesis in all their original glory through these guys eyes. Highly recommended.
B000UR366S|3.0|Whereas I have always respected Joni Mitchell and her material for their intelligence and quality, this CD is borderline depressing.  She is indeed telling like it is but after awhile you want to feel like there is some hope, that all of the different world crises and gloom and doom she sings about may have some solution.  I didn't hear much of that.  I admit, it may be that I was not drawn back to it time and time again as I am with Dylan's last few offerings.  Maybe there was more to it than I was getting from the first few passes through the material ... don't know.    Great musicianship and production as always but not exactly an uplifting listen for the holidays.
B000066AXE|5.0|I have seen this movie many times and it's the kind of movie that   will touch your heart and you will watch it over and over again.    A Beautiful Mind is just a very touching movie.
0743243153|5.0|This book is still one of my all time favorites.  Though a bit outdated now, the values and guidance is still all good, basic, sound advice.  Well worth the read, espeically if you are struggling with relationships or just life in general.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Jennifer connelly did a really good job in this movie.  Her boyfriend (played by Jared Leto)was making money selling drugs  and was very much addicted to drugs. His girlfriend (played by Jennifer connelly) was also consumed by drugs and the money she would make from the drugs.  The movie shows how drugs can ruin your life and make you do things  you regreat later.
0061186422|3.0|Hardcore Gaiman fans will find little new to love in this release. It'd make a great way to introduce younger readers to Gaiman's style, but most of the stories here have been recycled from his other short story collections, [[ASIN:0380789027 Smoke and Mirrors: Short Fictions and Illusions]] and [[ASIN:B000JMKTAU Fragile Things]]. I do, however, appreciate the homage to Ray Bradbury ([[ASIN:B000FHBO4O R Is for Rocket]]).
032147404X|4.0|This book was easy for me to read and understand.  Of course, I'd taken a photography course already. So it was a great compliment to what I already knew as an amateur photographer.  But the author has a sense of humor and explains things in such a way that, I think, even someone who had no photography classes may be able to understand.
B00000272N|5.0|\\"Facelift\\" was AIC's surge into the grunge limelight. It has become regarded as something of a classic over the years, showing the roots of one of the best bands from the grunge scene. While I feel \\"Facelift\\" comes up lacking when compared to the band's later LP's (their career pinnacle \\"Dirt\\" and the menacing self titled release), it is a great album, and worthy of a place in any rock/grunge collection.<br /><br />There is no lack of good song writing on \\"Facelift\\". The album contains a bunch of AIC classics, such as the one-two punch of \\"We Die Young\\" and \\"Man In A Box\\", both AIC at their catchiest and heaviest (As a side note, I saw the band's new line-up this summer in Toronto and \\"Man In A Box\\" has lost absolutely none of its power - it was one of the highlights of the show, with the whole crowd booming along to the chorus and headbanging relentlessly to the lead riff). Other standouts of the album include the menacing \\"Bleed The Freak\\", the slower \\"Love, Hate, Love\\" and the unapologetic brutality of \\"It Ain't Like That\\". All of these songs hit hard with typically excellent Cantrell riffs and solos and of course the glorious vocals of the late Layne Staley. While other parts of the album become a little repetitive, especially towards the end of the album, \\"Facelift\\" is a very pleasurable outing into the boom of grunge and one of its most important bands.

B000HEWEDK|5.0|THIS WAS A SUPERB MOVIE FOR ALL SCIENCE FICTION FANS THE SPECIAL EFFECTS AND SCENES WERE AWESOME
0375842209|5.0|Forget all your assumptions about World War II stories and Holocaust dramatizations. This is a stunningly different, fresh, tender and devastating account. Zusak's choice of narrator could have left us with a gimmicky, self-impressed literary exercise, but in his careful hands, it becomes a brave and compelling choice.<br /><br />Reducing the story to a sentence or two makes it sound rather pedestrian: how does the rise of Nazism and the arc of World War II affect the residents of a small German town? Characters run the gamut from enthusiastic Nazi party members to conscientious, good folk, trying to live their lives under a horrible regime. Even the heroism we see is small, quiet, on the individual level... and all the more powerful as such. It's hard to turn away from the humanization of even some who serve in the German military: people who, in most accounts, are pure evil packaged in a tidy uniform.<br /><br />The main character, Liesel, is beautifully and believably written, from her early childhood through her teenage years. The \\"supporting cast\\" of characters is adroitly rendered and never falls into caricature.<br /><br />This is an absolute must-read! It is categorized by the publisher as a Young Adult book, which just goes to show how strained those categorizations can be. This is a book for all, teens and adults alike.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|This adaptation went as far from the story line as you can get and still cal piece \\"Jane Eyre.\\" It is unecessarily tarted up - it would be as good of a story without having 'chemistry' between lead character practicaly hitting you about the head, and not in a good way. Also, what's up with 'Rochester' being so rude all the time?<br />On the other hand, Ruth Wilson is fantastic actress, Toby Stephens is a hottie, and scenery was lovely and lush. BBC can't really make anything too horrible, but this is not their most outstanding job.
B000VSBX34|5.0|I first saw this movie as a teenager in 1965 and since I was a huge Beatlemaniac, it was awesome to see my Beatles larger than life!  I've never lost that enthusiasm for them.  When I saw that this was being released in remastered condition, I was thrilled.  I ordered as soon as I knew it would be available.  I am not disappointed!  Watching this on a 52\\" plasma display with 5.1 surround sound put me straight back into Beatlemania heaven!  Yeah, yeah, yeah!!!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|As the saying goes, if you liked \\"P&P\\", you'll love \\"North and South\\". 'Nuff said.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I bought this album when it came out in 76 with the money I'd made helping out at the grocery store around the corner. I was fifteen at the time. Three years later I bought a new copy. I had played the first one so many times the grooves had lost the music.   As it was time for a third copy, cd came out, so I went for that, a Japanese pressing - the best at the time.   Now this. The new remastered version is the bomb. Clear and crisp but also good in the mid tones and bass. Well worth the 4th investment.  What is there left to say to the music? Stevie is a genius and this one is his masterpiece. Who doesn't know I Wish, Sir Duke, Ordinary Pain, Isn't She  Lovely, As, etc, etc, etc.   This album has accompanied me since high school and it will continue to do so through whatever there is to come. Amidst all the cd's in my collection it will always stand out. Truly SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE.
159562015X|5.0|I have purchased over 80 copies of this book for myself, through my church, and for others.  The assessment is so accurate that it's scary.  Tons of research has gone into strengths-based psychology and this assessment is the prized end result of it.<br /><br />The one difference between Strengthsfinder 2.0 vs. 1.0 is the fact that this book is highly commercialized and individualized.  Thus, it's not meant to be used in a group setting, it's meant to be done individually.<br /><br />I did not know this, but once I taught a course on this material and talked to the people at Gallup, I figured this fact out.<br /><br />Thus, if you want to know yourself better, then buy this book.<br />If you want to teach a course on this, then buy StrengthsQuest.
B000ULPFH2|5.0|Who doesn't know this story about a gangster trying to find his way back into the straight life? Sadly, he doesn't make it. Too many old connections.   Although the first scene already gives away the end, Pacino's tight and heartfelt acting carries you through the story making you forget what you already know. When the shock returns, you wish it to be just another nightmare.   Pacino is more than perfect in depicting this terrific story about honor, revenge and the power of trying to live your dreams. Nobody but Al could have painted us this Carlito with more depth, sadness and humor. Everything is perfect here, camera, music, design, the pace, acting, the script. If ever you'll find the time, you've got to read the books the film is based upon by Edwin Torres.  Also starring in this Brian de Palma masterpiece are Sean Penn as his attorney, Penelope Ann Miller as his on and off girlfriend and Luis Guzman (the great) and a nice cameo by Viggo Mortensen.  The HD DVD transfer is wonderful. Pacino is almost entering the living room. Sound, picture: WOOW!  Extras include deleted scenes, an interview with the director and a making of.
B00065MDSG|5.0|King Crimson are the epitome of progressive music, & \\"Lark's Tongue in Aspic\\" is a fine chapter in the on-going story of one of the greatest bands of all-time. this is the album when Bill Bruford left Yes, at the cusp of achieving stardom in the U.S. themselves, to enter the court of the Crimson King himself, guitarist & founder Robert Fripp. it's a shame Jaime Muir left the band after the recording of this album - but it hardly slowed Fripp & co. down in any way!
0307237699|5.0|You know what I like best about Barack?  Not his policies (there are some I don't agree with), and not his political beliefs (again, I don't agree with all of them)...So what is it I like best about Barack Obama?  It is the Spirit of Hope he projects.  And he couldn't project this Spirit of Hope if it wasn't 100% sincere.  He is an optimist.  He is a person of faith.  And he has real faith in the future of this country.      I think it takes real courage to be an optimist and project a spirit of Hope.  If you are negative, if you say there are no real solutions and project a  spirit of gloom and doom, you will not be criticized.  You will be thought of a realistic and intelligent.  But if you are opitimistic, pundits will take pot shots at you, your views will be criticized, and you will be dismissed as an unralistic dreamer.    But let's look at another person who could very well have been categorized as an unrealistic dreamer.  John F. Kennedy boldly announced in front of the entire world that the U.S. would send a man to the moon within the decaded of the 60s.  Was it unrealistic?  Yes.  But it was a grand dream.  It was a dream that inspired people.  And it was a dream that was ultimately fulfilled.    Barack is like JFK.  He is a dreamer...and if he inspires enough people, he dreams for America may very well come true!    I also want to recommend[[ASIN:0757300537 Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices]]--this is a book that fills your heart with so much hope that it could have been written by Barack himself!
B000002GWJ|5.0|While i'll admit that i'm preferable to his later, more experimental sounding albums, \\"Blue Valentine\\" is another fine example of Tom Waits' ability for song-writing & overall presence. From his cover of \\"Somewhere\\" from West Side Story (Maria never sounded so soulful) to the very last note of the title track, his dark & distinct voice wrings true. a wonderful addition to the collection of any Waits fan.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|I didn't see this at the movies because I just wasn't sure it'd work for me even though I love musicals.  Was I ever wrong!  I loved this movie!!!!  Everyone was spectacular!  Nikki Blonsky was such a natural in front of a movie camera.  I hope to see her more often.  John Travolta was amazing in drag.  The music, the dancing, the songs!  This was classic 60's.  It was very well done and I'm very happy I bought it.
006056251X|5.0|Excellent. I loved Sebastian. I loved how their relationship grew and that they talked and got to know each other. I loved that he did so many little things to show his care for her all through rather than just magically being in love with her at the end. did not like him having to be ill and not his normal vital self but all in all he made the book for me.
0307346617|5.0|I love horror books and movies, especially if they have zombies. Max Brooks has written a chilling and realistic account of a war that one can hope we never face. There's a great attention to detail that combines comedy and action along with a few heart warming parts that all come together to form a story you just can't put down.  I highly recommend this book; hopefully Mr. Brooks has something else coming out soon!
B000VWYJ86|4.0|but still way above all the other, so-called thrillers. Bourne has action and brains, always a plus in this kind of movie. A fitting entry into the series. No way they'll stop at three. Just hope the writing holds up.
B000VI70WM|2.0|I have been a fan since I was a child. I was the total Duranie. But I never got to see them perform live because I was too young and my parents refused to take me to a concert. But I have everything Duran has ever put out including ridiculous amounts of paraphenalia and even all the obscure vinyl remixes. But anything after Wild Boys has not been good. The song Come Undone is okay but still not right. This album is not the Duran I knew and loved. Simon's voice still sounds great but that's all the acclaim I can muster. I miss them but still have the memory of how amazing they once were.
0440238609|5.0|First off, don't let the reviews that denounce this book because of atheism fool you.  I just finished the first one and it is very good.  The story is somewhat complex and very compelling.  Most importantly it encourages this thing called.... THINKING.  For some reason religious people do not like to let this little thing get in the way of \\"faith\\"...    For those of you who are wondering wether or not you want your children reading this book, you might as well shut the light off in their spirits and brains.  Parents whom try to shut off their child's mind in order to preserve their own beliefs are poor parents.  If your child truly believes in their religion then a book about armored bears and a small girl with an althiometer will not change their minds.      The book is VERY good.  It IS a children's book, and it IS an allegory against organized religion.  The last passage in the first book is the most thought provoking, and it makes a great deal of sense if you apply it to the controversy surrounding the books.
B000K7VHJQ|1.0|I wish there was a lower rating.  If you're looking for the most gratuitous depiction of depravity available since the uncut Caligula here you go. Actually, this makes Caligula look like a Saturday morning cartoon. I fear for all of us when \\"Christians\\" find this movie moving in any other way than bowel moving. This is the kind of Christianity that the witch-burners had. Anyone who has read and understood the New Testament will be disgusted and outraged that this movie was not only made but encouraged.  THIS IS NOT WHAT THE GOSPELS ARE ABOUT.  This movie is NOT historically accurate (of course how can we expect accuracy from the someone who made Braveheart or the Patriot). The Jews are out for blood and the Romans are just doing their job. And, of course, it's Palestine but nobody speaks Greek. This is historical revisionism on a Biblical scale. It even picks and chooses it's way through the Gospels, so it's not anymore accurate a depiction of those than an Evangelical sermon. Gibson sought to create nothing more than controversy. I find it disturbing that any Christian would praise this filth.  Apparently it's big with the Fundamentalists, but they also pick and choose their way through the Bible, so that isn't suprising. It also seems to be a big hit with the S&M crowd. hmm.  So what's next for Gibson, a revisionist version of Auschwitz maybe, with Mel in the role of Rudolf Hoss?  Avoid this movie or avoid lunch.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|This album totally rocks!  I love how it's fun, catchy, and upbeat.  She is the most talented girl singer out there with an amazing voice, and I'll always love and respect her music.  I also love how she constantly changes her style and tries new, unique things.  It's disappointing how she receives so many negative comments, and I think she deserves much better recognition and respect.  Avril is awesome!
B000TX7B5U|4.0|While not  as polished as the work Serj has done in the past with SOAD, Elect the Dead still stands as a pretty great piece of metal styling, epecially on tracks such as the title track and Beethoven's C***

1400063515|3.0|This, like a lot of nonfiction books on markets, is a Harvard Business Review article grown overlong.    But's it message (of being more humble of what our cognitive and analytical methods can do) is diminished by being delivered by someone who is profoundly lacking in humility. And the autobiographical fluff that packs the book is annoying as you wade through pages and pages of how Taleb is so clever to get to the 1-2 paragraphs of actual thought in each chapter.    Also, he doesn't take into account that the cognitive methods he disparages could have prevented so-called Black Swans from occuring.     You only notice the failure of your risk management/safety/loss prevention systems when they don't work, not when they do. Taleb doesn't acknowledge his own lacunae in this.    A bit more humility and a lot more editing would have made this a better book. But there are still good insights in it, so three stars.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A great movie and deserving of much praise. A wake up call to those who pollute and discard. Every person should be made to view this film, especially the children. It should be mandatory viewing in elementary schools nationwide!  Thank you.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Daniel Craig was simply amazing in this top quality action film.Finally Bond is represented the way Ian Fleming would have liked him to be since Connery. The plot was great, dialog was interesting, and the action scenes are awesome and real. The HD is great and I have not encountered any problems at all. I hope Bond 22 will be just as good or even some how better.
B000LXH0AE|2.0|This film was one i have anticipated for a long time.  Finally rented it, and once again will farrell failed to deliver. Should have come as no surprise considering his past work.  Talladega nights was not funny.  Anchorman was worse. I could go on, but i will spare you.  I did enjoy this movie, mildly, however expected much more.  The director's past films include \\"Stay\\", one of my recent favorites.  This does not measure up.  The ending left me without much thought.  I derived no great message from this film. it did not move me in any way.  The highlight involves the purchase of a guitar, and the performance of a song (one that i prayed when spoken of would be \\"Fred's Slacks\\", but was not).  I think if stripped down, one could see the film for what it is. A two hour anti-tobacco commercial.
B000002LND|2.0|I so regret buying this cd, it is not a complete anthology of Madonna's hits and it was released too soon to make it a thorough collection.  For one thing, most of the songs are EDITED for time.  The best part of  \\"Holiday\\" is gone, the best part of \\"Into The Groove\\" is gone, the best part of \\"Lucky Star\\" is gone, \\"Angel\\" isn't included, \\"Dress U Up\\" isn't included, \\"Everybody\\" isn't included, \\"Burning Up\\" isn't included. The cd doesn't even use some of the better 80's dance versions of the hits.  I'm actually sincerely angered by this cd, with all the money Madonna has, to do this to her fans so you have to buy ALL of the cds for the total collection.  THANKS MADONNA GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!
B000W4KT64|1.0|Hairspray is based on a John Waters classic.  As if such a thing existed.  Waters is the most overated filmaker ever.  Well maybe second to Schpeelburg.  The original film was terrible.  Ricci Lake? Divine? The modern take was hyped because of the envolvement of L. Ron's # 2 man himself. Travolta.  I wanted, going in, to completely despise this movie.  Christopher Walken saved this wretched tale from zero star oblivian.  The message is one about segregation and integration. There was a seen that had me laughing hysterically.  When the adorable Amanda Bynes appears on tv dancing with an african american, her mother, played by Allison Janney, takes a cloth and tries to scrub the black right off him. The always noyteworthy Queen Latifah, appears in another typical role for her but does not manage to hurt the film much since it's already painful to watch.  The music is unlistenable.  I thought Travolta was a hiddeous creature in Battlefield Earth. This will give me nightmares.  Have to give a shout out to Michelle Pfiffer as this is truly her worst performance ever on film. Cameo by John Waters is humorous.  Save yourself some cash, spend your hard earned money on ipecac.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|My grandchilden and I loved the movie and watched it over and over.  It was a great story.
B000TYWAUA|2.0|Was it too short? Or too long? The action was good ; I suppose that was the movie's general aim. But there was a failed storyline or something! Watch it if you want to see some Spartans do their thing. But if you want something that will draw you in, other than blood and appendages flying off, go elsewhere.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I can't get enough of my complete set of FRIENDS.  I have been a faithful watcher from the very first episode & never missed an episode! I watch this set all the time, from beginning to end & then start all over again.  When I can't sleep, or nothing else good is on TV - this is my DVD of choice. This is an investment - worth every dime. I totally recommend it.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This album was worth the wait.  I loved most of the songs expecially Radar & Piece of Me.  The only one I did't care for that much was Get Naked.  Her subject matter in the lyrics isn't that great for children, but the dance beats are the best.  Some language wasn't needed (like Britney B....).  I listened to it on MSN Listenbooth & bought it right away.  Get it now!
