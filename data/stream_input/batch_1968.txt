B00569LSUG|3.0|but it didn't quite get there.  I was inspired to download this album by 'Solitude is Bliss,' which is by far the best track on the album.  I love their trippy, throw-back style, but it didn't always mesh with the vocals.  Still, a good album and I don't regret the buy.

B000FA5TTW|5.0|i was not sure i would like this book as i am not at all into supernatural thrillers. i am so glad i read it. it is strange to call it beautiful, but it is. it is also disturbing and heartbreaking. i connected with in several ways. First i was Susie Salmon's exact age in 1973, and the author so accurately recreated that time I felt like i traveled back in time. i was also going through cancer treatment when I read it and was dealing with fears of my own mortality. I can truely say after reading this book I was less afraid of dying. I was comforted by the authors vision of heaven. Thank you for writing this book.

B0074VTHKM|4.0|grisham is a great story teller & has sent the bar high for his books; this one was a good read but does not compare to some of grisham's others; i am not sure i will read more of the t boone books, they are entertaining but not as good as some of his other works which still means they are better than many other authors out there
B008M87GJK|3.0|Just ok. Needs more photos and updated more often. The stories are interesting because they come from a different perspective than US news stories.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|another great read by baldacci; i did not rate the forgotten, his latest i believe, as high as most of his other books i have read including this one; i recommend this book to all balcacci fans

B000FC0ZAI|5.0|Like many, I bought this book inadvertantly, thinking that it was another book of a similar name... WOW! This is really a fantastic work regarding the human condition.<br /><br />Mr. Callanan's style impresses me as a sophisticated blend of John Irving, Tim O'Brien and Joseph Heller.

B009HQ9UHC|2.0|This game is fun, but not so different than Angry Birds, it is not the game style I thought it would be.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|this app work's the same as when you are on a laptop or your smart phone so it works well
B005HSG3U6|4.0|It fits perfectly and is easy to clean.  I like the little elastic part that can hold the front flap shut but also a good place to hold some instructions for my Kindle so I can remember how to navagate it.  I'm a slow learner and for a while need to see how to do things until they become second nature.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Really good book. I thought there was a little too much coverage of the Franz's war time experiences, and not enough of Charlie's. Franz's story got bogged down at times. The part where Charlie and his crew were readying for their bombing mission gave me chills. In my early 20's, my concern was where the next party was. It just blows my mind what these guys went through and did for their country at such a young age. Just unreal. It got a little dusty in the room while reading the last chapter. Pretty damn powerful.  May both these gentleman rest in peace.

B0017SWPXY|2.0|Not a real interesting story. Did not work for me having the family dog relate family life in the first person<br />.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing and heartfelt love story!! Would definitely recommend to others!!<br /><br />Nicholas sparks is a genius with the romance novels! Could not put this down.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I think that this should be rated as a late teen, young adult novel. The subject matter is prolonged and much of the romance language is repetitive.......much  kissing on the head, etc. I only continued reading as I had the kindle on holiday. The plot was a cunning interweaving of human relationships, but seemed unrealistic compared to real life.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I really am enjoying this Mahjong game. I have been playing on the computer for years. I really like this one because it has such a variety of games and it keeps it fresh all the time. I've been playing Mahjong before bed instead of reading and that is really a change. Just be careful cause it's habit forming. Hard to stop.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Clean Master is a well-designed and useful app.  It comes highly recommended to users who would rather not have to go spelunking through countless folders looking for extra space.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would find myself so tense reading this book--it had me so stressed out! I would definitely recommend this book if you like a good page turner.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Anybody with an interest in geopolitics, modern warfare, sociology and the human condition will be unable to put this finely-crafted work-of-fiction-disguised-as-a-historical-account down.  Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is fine but I removed it from my Kindle because every time I used it a male dating site popped up.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A definite MUST READ!  It was quick reading, especially since I couldn't put it down!<br />Have to admit that it could have gone on...ended on what seems to be the beginning<br />of a happily ever after.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Half hearted portrayals.  disappointing.  But if the Dark Knight is your thing, then you might like this; it doesn't have the psazz of the nother christian bale portrayals.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Full of interesting observations about people, animals and religion. A story about survival under the harshest conditions. Makes you consider what you might do or not do to live. Also challenges perception of reality and what the mind will do to protect itself.
0307949508|4.0|This is the second book in the Stieg Larsson trilogy, The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo series. The first book, The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo was the beginning of Lizbeth Salander's story as a seriously intelligent and crafty computer hacker. So much so that it gives her a job which further leads her into an investigation that unravels the rest of her story. While the first book is the account of how it all begins and how all the parts in the large picture tie together, the second book delves into Lizbeth Salander's personal history with the sadistic individuals who have not once but multiple times maimed her, psychologically and intellectually. Nothing Lizbeth Salander can't handle, though.<br /><br />This second book in the trilogy focuses on the question, Who is Lizbeth Salander? It's the pertinent theme that dominates the novel. Those surrounding Salander have a very specific and narrow opinion and perspective of who Salander is but no one really knows Lizbeth Salander. They all speculate and they all find out how wrong they were. The outsider's perspective is that Salander is all the following: 'pathologically unwell,' 'unreliable,' socially introverted,' 'regarded as dangerous to herself and others,' ' very lonely and odd person.' Her morality is questioned and is often times judged because it doesn't coincide with that of the justice system.<br /><br />On the other hand, Salander's morality is well above others and well more moral and ethical than the standards of the justice system. To use violence she would have to be exceedingly threatened or provoked. She is an incredible researcher. And she often holds herself to her own values and beliefs. I believe that Salander is a strong willed individual who knows how to take care of herself and knows what's best for her, contrary to the beliefs of the other characters about her.<br /><br />The plot in this second books is just the back-drop. What is of real significance is getting to know who Lizbeth Salander is. If you are curious to know who she is and why has become to be who she is in the way she's portrayed throughout the book, read this second book, otherwise just skip right over to the third. If you're interested in knowing the details of the plot more so than her persona and character, skip right to the third book.<br /><br />So I'll say it again. This second book in the series covers the whole spectrum of who Salander is. You will know who Salander is from multiple perspectives, and you in turn will have the chance to decide who Salander is. I think that Larsson really doesn't disappoint, yet again.If you are curious to know who she is and why has become to be who she is in the way she's portrayed throughout the book, read this second book, otherwise just skip right over to the third.

B0043RSK3K|5.0|what howard zinn's &#34;the people's history of the united states&#34; handles briefly (as blasphemous as that may sound), this stone/kuznick read fills in our knowledge, especially during the wilson, fdr and subsequent administrations. shedding light on the motivations of these presidents and his staffs, the public, both in it's perceptions and misconceptions via the press and other authorates of those times.  whereas zinn proportions much of his work to the labor and minority perspective, this book expounds a bit up the food chain, but at least in a way that is fresh and delightfully illuminating.  as an example (not so much a difference in food chain focus but to illustrate how a gap is filled), zinn deals a fair amount of time with general smedley butler, the bonus march and the nipped aborted military coup in 1934 (to overthrow fdr and install a fascist government), but, the stone/kuzick work chooses to give this mention in only 3 paragraphs.  but... the book immediately then focuses on the hearings headed up by a senator gerald nye, a progressive republican, whom i had not heard of before, dealing with the military protecting overseas businesses of americans, not by addressing bankers but upon the arms merchants and manufacturers themselves... &#34;munitions trust&#34; and war profiteering, and their role in &#34;propaganda in pushing the government toward war&#34;.<br /><br />well researched history is too broad for any one book's purview and other flashlights from other pens can still scatter the rats. to deal fairly with the issues of justice and compassion, an honest assessment of history is one step, a big stride, towards that understanding. thank you peter and oliver for providing a primer to help reduce our naiveté.
030759565X|4.0|A long-time follower of the SK blog, I anticipated simply-explained yet satisfying recipes, along with Deb's sense of humor and 'relatability' as a home cook. This book definitely fit the bill on those counts; I've made recipes from almost every category, and they've turned out well. The one caveat is that some required tweaking in my kitchen, much like some recipes on the blog. This is understandable, but may be frustrating to a beginning cook with perfectionist tendencies! (Guilty.) Overall, though, it's evident that these recipes were tested thoroughly, unlike some other cookbooks I've found. The writing style was funny and made dish explanations enjoyable to read, too.<br /><br />One MAJOR positive of this book: Deb does options for alternate ingredients whenever possible. As a vegetarian, a good half of most cookbooks are rendered useless because they require meat. I've never eaten meat, so I have no idea how to substitute for it, but find those recipes very intriguing. Deb was a vegetarian, so in addition to having an entire section of flavor-complex, meat-free dishes (hurrah!) she gives us a bit of insight on how to make the meat recipes vegetarian, both implicitly and explicitly. Recipes overall vary in flavor profiles and methods, providing a good jumping-off point to more adventurous cooks. (I've gotten to this stage now, and this book is much more approachable than the intro compendia I started out on.)<br /><br />A few minor complaints: there are typos in this book. Not many, but enough that I wondered what happened during editing. A few recipes also lacked pictures of the complete dish, though photos of ingredients were included. Overall, however, the recipes work very well and can be altered, the author makes more complicated techniques much less imposing, and the layout is aesthetically very pleasing.
1439177783|4.0|(I wrote the following as a comment on the review by \\"margaret\\", but decided also to include it in the entire review section.)<br /><br />I don't usually comment on reviews, but when I read \\"margaret's I had to respond. The reviewer is certainly entitled to her opinion regarding the book, but to write that she was \\"rooting for the eating disorder\\" is both appalling and disparaging. Every year hundreds of young women in this country die from eating disorders, and this kind of review only adds fuel to their resolve. Do you not think that many girls and women who are anorexic, bulimic or both will read the reviews before they buy the book? What kind of message does this kind of review send to them?<br /><br />de Rossi never said she had disdain for fat people, but that she saw herself that way and had contempt for herself. Portia's reason for writing the book was to cleanse her soul. When it was picked up for publication, she was as surprised as anyone.<br /><br />I agree with some other reviewers who felt the writing was a bit stilted, and hard to follow at times because of the way de Rossi jumped from subject to subject and back again. But \\"margaret\\", look deeper into the book, (even if you have to buy the printed version) and read it for what it is --- a closer look at a woman who hated herself so much she nearly killed herself from self-abuse. It is a story of healing and coming to terms with oneself, and written to help others who may face the same problems. At least applaud her for her courage.

B001E45XT4|5.0|I've had this headset for over a year now and it continues to be a great headset. Sound quality and comfort are good for everyday users. Never had a problem with it creating hotspots on my ears or head from wearing for a few hours at a time.<br /><br />Update: I still have this headset, it has traveled all over the world with me while I was in the military and it still going strong, no cracks, still comfortable, everything still works. I use it maybe three-four days a week and it has turned out to be a very durable headset.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Where to start with these books???<br />The first few chapters are a little hard to get through - not because of the writing style (these books are great to read) but because there are so many characters it's hard to piece it all together.. but once you figure out where they all fit - you grow to love (or hate) them all!<br />I purchased all of the books in the series in one go and couldn't put them down! I am usually a quick reader but there are so many of these books and they are so large that it took me a couple of months to get through them all.<br />Trying to think about what these books are similar too is hard.. There is magic & dragons (but it's not naff, fake or unbelievable), love, war, tragedy, heartbreak.. you name it these books have it!<br />If you haven't read anything like this before.. give it a go and be sure to stick with the initial first chapters - you won't be disappointed!<br />The last book left me wanting more! I can't wait for George Martin to release the next book to see how the story ends.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|[[ASIN:B004EPZ0AC Happy Feet Two (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] This is a great movie, I do not see why it is a two star. It is about global warming and what penguins and mammals have to go through in order to survive in this changing world because of what we as humans are doing. I would recommend this movie to family and friends.
B00ANRHFYO|5.0|If you’re a fan of the original ride, this is a must have.  Several rare recordings by the talented Paul Frees.

B007RE0RR8|5.0|Just what I was expecting, my daughter loved it and the price was great! I have nothing else to say
B001O03NCW|5.0|Funny and entertaining. Must watch more than once to really get it. Do watch out for bad language, I have a bad language guard so it didn't affect me
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I had hopes of an intelligent, helpful book about this &#34;Dr's&#34; experience... what a waste of money.  His talk of being in and out of the &#34;core&#34; and the &#34;gateway&#34; is just plain nuts.  Save your money and go see a good fiction movie...since this isn't even good fiction.
B0073Q0DZG|2.0|I am an avid 'birder' and thought that the cast would make this movie fantastic, but I was not impressed. It does have its funny moments but I would not watch it again.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Little difficult getting everything set up the way I wanted it, other than that it works great. I use it for work to keep notes on customers separated an  in their own place. Saves  everything automatically and keeps me organized. Not bad at all.
B00110K62U|5.0|I had this version on tape but wanted the DVD because my VHS died.  While the ending was different, it did not include all the Jean ValJeans from all over the world), the rest of it was there.  Thanks for the quick shipment.
6301973461|5.0|i had to fast forward it all the way then rewind it completely but it worked just fine ... clear
B0026IUXO2|4.0|You certainly can't fault any performances in this film. Cate Blanchett is superlative. She fascinates. The story and characters pull you in. But it has a strange sort of pacing to it, where just as you feel it's getting started, it ends. It's like you go out to a nice restaurant, have a cocktail and an appetizer, a salad, they pour the wine for the main course.....and then bring you the check.
B001USHRCK|5.0|My kids got this for Christmas this year and they love it!  It's a fun set that opens and closes and has lots of new and interesting Lego pieces that you may not already own.  We have a zillion legos.  Love these!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was #1 on Time Magazine's list of best books of 2012, so I decided to give it a try.  I've just finished it with tears in my eyes. I don't recall the last time a book moved me like this. Kind of speechless.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved the book just wish it had gone on a little longer after the issue was resolved. But would recommend to anyone.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Really enjoyed the book! And the characters. I would reccommend it.  All of Connelly's books are a great read! It jumps right into action from the beginning.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very good book for kids because it is funny and I give it five stars so I would prefer that you read this book
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|really enjoy the game, could use weapon types. would enjoy it more but there are many bogs that limit game play
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|The most original television show on the air. The writing is top-notch. The cast is excellent. And it's scary beyond words.
B003UYUP5I|5.0|More than worth the money. Essential for the everyday bro on the scene looking to make  ok be he'll of a first impression.....and if you do it right that's the only one she gets

1442481919|5.0|This set is great for a first set of books.  The author does such a good job of talking to little ones.  Having read these books to my grandsons, I felt it would be great for my nieces daughter.
B003FCMAS0|4.0|reasonably entertaining....not great. A bit strange, though. The requirement for lengthy review prevents many, including me, from providing reviews and should be discontinued..
B005LAIHRC|5.0|Dvd plays just fine. I am NOT a Tom Cruise fan but I liked this movie and his performance. The music was awesome.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I do like Christian Bale's batman over all the others.  Great story and well done production.  Fast paced and worth having.
0765325950|4.0|***MOST OF THE 1 STAR REVIEWS ARE PEOPLE COMPLAINAING ABOUT THE LACK OF AN EBOOK***<br /><br />I began reading this series when I was about 13 years old, I'm 30 now...so half my life has been culminating to this book. First, I believe the series, as a whole, is probably a 3 out of 5. The first 5 books were \\"incredible,\\" the next few \\"ok,\\" the next few \\"weak,\\" and the final two \\"decent.\\" I think the problem Robert Jordan had was that he expanded the story too much for one series, instead of having off shoots of the same world. He could've concentrated on the main characters and left more out of the lesser characters for other series. Now onto the actual review:<br /><br />I almost didn't want to begin reading this book, because once I began I wouldn't be able to stop. It is also an ending point of my childhood. I've spoken to many Harry Potter fans who felt the same about that series. I grew up with WoT being a main stay of my literary collection, and now that its over I feel old. That being said, I was at the book store at 9:00am and purchased my copy the first day. I began reading immediately (even though I was working) and barely stopped. I finished the book in probably 9 hours total over 2 days (again, I'm 30 and have responsibilities).<br /><br />The Good:<br />The story moved fast. There was waiting around for something to happen like books 9-11. However, with the story moving so fast, you almost wished there was a little more detail written in. I know that wasn't possible, or we'd all be waiting 2 years for book 15. I've read a lot of complaining about the ending, but I didn't think it was too bad. I think if RJ was still around to write it, it would've turned out better, but BS did a good job. Also, there were some unexpected deaths that left you saying, \\"What!?!?!\\" Not bad, mind you, but unexpected. The book also wrapped up most of the major plot lines, though not always well. It seemed that it was easier (shorter) to kill someone off than to do something else. I also enjoyed the fact that lesser characters from the earlier books make cameos, and luckily only a couple paragraphs instead of an entire chapter like RJ did sometimes.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Brandon Sanderson still didn't get the dialogue quite right with some of the characters. Mat's dialogue was much better than the last book, but still not great. I also couldn't quite envision the landscapes as I could with RJ. I had a general idea, but reading RJ is like watching TV with the level of detail he puts in.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />The realism of some of the situations is downright autrocious. Battlefield tactics used are just idiotic sometimes. Some characters seemed to act quite opposite as they would normally. The \\"last battle\\" between Rand and the Dark One was weakly written and lacked...something, not sure what.<br /><br />Overall it was a pretty decent book, definately not the best of the series, but certaintly not the worst. My main concern, however, is the fact that it kept me wanting more. The prologue, written exclusively (and quite obviously) by RJ, makes me want a follow-up series or two. I wouldn't mind BS do a follow-up mini-series or two, like Raymond E. Fiest does, on the rebuilding and beyond. It'd be great to focus on other characters, but have the main characters of the first book make appearances. I want more, but I'm still satisfied by the end.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are amazing! There are not enough words to describe how awesome they are. This album has a fantastic mix of original music and covers to keep everyone happy. Peponi is the family favorite... Watch them on YouTube, it enhances and changes the experience!!!<br /><br />What they do with string instruments is amazing!!
B005COO1X6|4.0|All Stephen King books are great.  Love the usual suspense of Stephen King, it is a definate page turner.  All Stephen King fans need to read this.
B00AFWEPVI|2.0|I'm new to this technology, but not a neophyte.  This is not intuitive and even my son and dol who are both in IT had inssues with it--largely because they are accustomed to superior aps.
0525953728|5.0|Excellent first hand account from one of our true American heros. A must read for anyone interested in the life of a Navy Seal and the mission that removed our most wanted terrorist.
1451620829|5.0|Born in the early 70s, I grew up loving Kiss: I wore Kiss costumes on Halloween; I had Kiss lunch boxes and action figures; I was too young to understand just how sucky their movie was or the fact that Kiss was not on the same footing as other rock bands of the decade. I idealized these guys and I am not sure why, perhaps just childhood naivet&eacute;.  It was all just good to me.<br /><br />Reading the Catman's autobiography makes one realize how \\"not good\\" things actually were.<br /><br />From Ace and Peter's out of control drug use to Gene and Paul's outsized egos, this was a band with major talent but even bigger problems. Peter isn't afraid to sling the mud: whether it's the fact that his best buddy Ace may have been giving him oral under a sheet with a groupie or Gene's relishing the taste of groupie menstral blood smeared on his face and teeth; whether its Peter's own constant cheating on his wife or Paul's not-quite-clear sexuality; Peter Criss spares no one, not even himself.<br /><br />The thing that seems resoundingly clear from reading this book is that no matter how bad it was at certain times, the Kiss years were the best years of these guys' lives, though they didn't recognize it and maybe still don't.<br /><br />There are times in the book when Peter laments how he \\"used\\" to act, but then he recounts screaming at roadies and putting people--including fellow band members--down well into the Kiss reunion and farewell tours. Yeah, Paul and Gene may have done Peter (and Ace) dirty, but the Catman doesn't come out clean either. I'm giving this book 5 stars because it is honest and gives insights into one of the biggest bands of the 70s, although it thoroughly demolished the pedestal I'd misplaced these four on. I'm sure Ace, Paul and Gene would have different takes on the way Peter remembers things and his point of view.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great read! Definitely had some suspense and thrilling moments. I didn't want it to end, I'm excited for the movie!
B009VL28W2|5.0|This is the next closest you could get viewing this legendary metal band from the comfort of your sofa...besides being there.<br />Wish that it was also available in 3D. It could be simply awesome.
B00275EGX8|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. The actors in it did a very good job. I have heard a lot of crap about it not being realistic but what movie isn't dramatic with everything? It is Hollywood.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Superb restoration. Great picture..great sound...great white shark...what else could you ask for?<br />A must buy collectors item. Get it quick.
B002XTBEDI|4.0|I liked this okay, but not nearly as well as I liked Cranford.  I was sorry that they left so many of the main characters from the other one out.
B000W4D94I|5.0|I got twister in this 3 movie set Twister / Poseidon / The Perfect Storm. But wanted to say if you wanted to get alone you still can't go wrong. One of the best blu-ray I have seen for a disaster movie. Clear picture, great sound. I just can't say enough good things about this movie. If you don't have the blu-ray go for it. I just love the story line and special effects. I just can't get over how clear the picture is. And how real the twisters look. It just amazes me. I had this on dvd but i'm so glad I upgraded to a blu-ray. I didn't go wrong and you won't either.
B001PU8N0I|3.0|Some things I liked about this and some I didn't.  I resent that they put a lesbian part in there that I didn't feel was even implied in the book.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I enjoyed this novel The Black Box by Michael Connelly.  I also liked the familiarity of characters from previous novels.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I cannot say enough good about this whole series.  I highly recommend purchasing it.  Also recommend Amazon to buy it from.  My daughter accidently bought a pirated copy....returned it and reported it....but a deal is not always a deal.
0316096199|4.0|The condition of the book wasn't 100% but was a decent buy with slight aging on the edges. Overall I would recommend this item.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I owned this movie years ago.  I am happy to own it on DVD.  It has been a family favorite for years and actually follows the dialogue from the book far better than most adaptations.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|I used this to access some not so straight forward accessible files for my HTC Thunderbolt back when I had it, so I trust it enough to use for my Kindle Fire HD, which also requires some digging to open certain files. **HInt** you can use this to locate the &#34;hidden&#34; camera app on the KFHD.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I love Spartacus and enjoying the series.  DVD set is in good condition.  Getting Blood and Sand next.  Good show!
B005LAIIFS|5.0|What a wonderful lesson for my 6 year old daughter, that if we believe in something it is real, if we really believe. We sat through this film together and she was entranced. Isn't believing in something the core of achieving success in life, and even though people may condemn this as fairy tale nonsense I for one used this film as a lesson to to her to believe.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Good quality, not much in the way of 'liner' information,but it does cover a brief review of each movie.  Would like more bio info of the actor
B0013FSVES|4.0|I bought this interpretation of &#34;La traviata&#34; to prepare for the upcoming Santa Fe Opera production next summer. I had heard Scotto live decades ago in Albuquerque with the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra (now defunct), reviewed that concert for the Albuquerque Journal and interviewed her over breakfast the next day and wanted a souvenir of that occasion. Scotto was a great Violetta in my estimation.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book beginning to end!!!  A must read for fans of Glillian Flynn a great author of our time.

B006LSZECO|3.0|The first half was boring but you have to get through it to have the second 1/2 make sense. I was disappointed in the ending.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|My brother in law showed this to us at Thanksgiving.  Everyone in the room wanted the DVD/CD.  It is fabulous beyond description! Bought one for son and husband for Christmas.  Niece ordered one on the spot. Other niece had it already.

B008UFUOH6|4.0|Competent musicianship.  The antidote to insipid sappy holiday recordings, she puts some thought into season.  The cover of of a standard is done respectfully without schmaltz.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|i had played the free game and liked it. i also like mahjong in general. inexpensive game that is a lot of fun.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Great gift for the guy who has been trying to get caught up on Harry Potter.  All 8 movies, nicely presented in convenient case.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It is very addicting.  I love to play it.  I would highly recommend it to all my friends and family.
B0045HCJ9E|3.0|I don't know.....<br />There are much worse movies, that is for sure.<br />This one did not age well though. LOTS of emphasis is put on what they considered \\"clever\\" dialog of the day I guess. It all gets kind of boring, amateurish, and long winded at times.<br />A Lot of the scenes are just kind of stupid and do not hold water by todays standards. Like sending a guy out to the middle of nowhere, and then trying to kill him with a crop duster.?<br />They could have just drove up and shut the Mother F'er.<br />It all gets kind of trite and ridiculous. Worth buying used for as cheap as you can find it. NOT one of Hitchcock's best.<br />Martin Landau and James Mason parts could have been played by first year drama students. What a waste of talent.<br />See if your local library has it.<br />Good Luck
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Keeps you reading as with most of his books.  Can't wait for the next book.

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|This seemed to be the year of the MIA main star in the sequels category.  The Batman movies, especially since the Dark Knight trilogy began, have been really excellent action flicks.  This last in the series, like the Bourne Legacy in the Bourne series, also turns up with the main hero largely MIA. In fact, the overall scope of this movie was at times kind of depressing what with our hero losing pretty much everything, including his home and even his faithful butler.  Bane, the main badass was just not as compelling as some of the others in my opinion; maybe it was the stupid mask.  Anyway, while ...Rises was certainly the weakest overall of the three, it is still a very respectable and thoroughly watchable and enjoyable flick in spite of it's flaws and disappointments.
0684857219|5.0|I have a copy of this book that I purchased in 1990.  My copy is thoroughly worn.  I read every page as an aspiring high school athlete and weight lifter.  I bought this new copy for my nephew - an aspiring high school athlete.<br /><br />Don't let the bodybuilder stigma dissuade you.  This book has TONS of useful information on nutrition, body science, and - most important - weight lifting.  The photos, information, plans methods and descriptions for weight training are excellent.<br /><br />And, for the Schwarzenegger fan, it's a must have!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I'm a total Bourne fanboy; what can I say?  We'll just get that out of the way.  The absence of Bourne/Damon is a bit of a problem with this movie, but Jeremy Renner does a respectable enough job here to make his character interesting in it's own right.  Still, without Bourne/Damon being around anywhere, the use of the Bourne name in the title becomes something of a stretch.  Be that as it may, once things FINALLY got rolling after some rather tedious opening minutes, the movie took off on it's own momentum and I found it very well done and entertaining.  In addition to Renner's excellent performance, I really enjoyed the work of Rachel Weisz and Ed Norton.  So, the bottom line is that I feel that in spite of the absence of Bourne/Damon, Renner and company managed to pull things off well enough that I look forward to seeing a continuation of this franchise in the future.  This is a very respectable action flick.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I was thrilled to receive the cd in the mail.  I had mislaid my previous copy so great to get back to Cohen's more recognizable tunes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book because it always keeps you on the edge of your seat. One tip though, is to read the first and second book first be because if you don't you won't understand any of it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love staying in touch with family and Facebook is a way for me to do that everyday and at any time.

B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Minnie is not at all the woman she seems.  To the casual observer, she seems mousy and biddable.  But her downcast eyes and quiet demeanor hide a brilliant mind and a will of steel.  She must keep up appearances, though. Her true identity is a secret, and if it ever gets out, her reputation will be destroyed.  Unfortunately, when she is falsely accused of printing seditious fliers, she realizes that all of her careful behavior may have been for naught.<br /><br />A chance encounter with Robert, the Duke of Clermont, gives Minnie an opportunity to lessen the damage, however.  Once she realizes he is the true author of the fliers, she confronts him and asks him to stop. He refuses, but he is intrigued by this woman who sees the real man behind his title.  And so the two of them do battle: She is determined to prove his involvement in the fliers, while he plans to convince everyone that he is smitten with her, so that she can find the solid future his actions may deprive her of.<br /><br />The more time they spend together, the more Minnie intrigues Robert.  Despite the difference in their social stations, he ends up falling for her.<br /><br />I love Courtney Milan's writing style.  It's smart. It makes me laugh.  And she makes me understand her characters. But I can't say this was the most engaging of her books.  The relationship was slow to take off.  Beyond that, both characters make choices that stood to obliterate the other. That's a tough pill to swallow.  First Minnie makes a conscious decision to destroy Robert... then he does the same to her.  I understood why they each thought they \\"had to\\" do what they did, but it wilted the romantic in me a bit.<br /><br />Minnie's big secret was different than your standard born-on-the wrong-side-of-the-tracks or I'm-not-really-a-virgin fare.  But after all the build up we had for it, the reveal seemed a bit anticlimactic.<br /><br />Despite my complaints, I liked the book overall. It's hard for me not to give my heart to a hero so emotionally wounded as Robert.  The poor man is so starved for love, there were times I wanted to jump into the book and give him a hug... And there was a scene where Minnie gives him a book that brought a tear to my eye.  Plus --a stealth virgin hero!  There are good elements in there.  It just wasn't my favorite from this author.a hero so emotionally wounded as Robert.  The poor man is so starved for love, there were times I wanted to jump into the book and give him a hug...

B004ZQRJFO|5.0|I got this cause i am a major fan of Eminem, but i had no idea Royce Da 59 was that good of a rapper and they bouced off each other i was so happy to have gotten this cd. Came very quickly and in great condition. I was not to upset about the cd coming in a case without all the cover or other stuff . But the cd is worth more to me than all the trimmings it usually comes in.
B0015DROBO|5.0|An excellent book with amazing plots which keeps the reader interested from the beginning to end. Love the intriguing mystery and the parallel stories of the characters. The author had an indepth knowledge of finance and business. The prose is clear, concise yet interesting to read. It gets better as one rereads it over and again.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I have just finished reading \\"A Casual Vacancy\\" by JK Rowling. It's hard to read her first book after the phenomenally successful Harry Potter series without comparing it. Well it is still JK Rowling and her writing still has that way of drawing you in, her characters jump of the page as grey outlines and are slowly coloured in and take form, until you believe you know them, but this is not the black and white world of Harry Potter, it's a very murky grey world, more Bleak House than Hogwarts; more Less than Zero than Deathly Hallows.<br />In essence it is the story of one man's death and how that impacts on the people around him, those who knew him well and those who barely knew his name, all are affected in this thought provoking book, that I would recommend to anyone. Potter fan or not.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Usual Reacher. Very fast paced, usual twist and turns and non stop action. Enjoyed every chapter. Reacher fans won't be disappointed.
0525958002|5.0|I have been a Duranie since 1982 with John Taylor as my favorite member of the band.  It saddened me deeply when he left the band, however, he did it to save his life.  I'm glad he learned from his mistakes and isn't afraid to share the process he went through.  He has my utmost respect.

B009NPM5Y2|2.0|Rock of Ages has its heart in the right place, but not its soundtrack.<br /><br />Growing up on '80s rock such as Poison, Twisted Sister, and Bon Jovi, I'm hesitant to hear my favorite songs sung by actors or anyone else other than the original singer(s).  The cast is competent, but it feels like karaoke night.<br /><br />The more disappointing aspect is the lack of cameos from the real rock stars that built the foundation for this film and provided the music.
B008476HBM|5.0|Always been a favourite of mine and I still love it.  Was the first e-book I've read and I found it convenient.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|There were parts that were very funny and the animation with combining with people was good but some of the language was not necessary.  Seemed like the writer got carried away with being vulgar.

B00AMBH70S|3.0|I loved the previous Bourne films and think Jeremy Renner is quite the leading man, but this film left me frustrated and a bit sad that Matt Damon is left off screen, as he IS the only Bourne to truly care about. The exposition on this film is tedious, slow and confusing. It's not until they have Rachael Weisz's character deliver a necessary and clarifying monologue in a speeding car that you truly get what the first half of the film was about. The last act of the chase is tired and truly unconvincing. I don't care what meds you're on, you're not likely to know how to drive a motorcycle down a railing, much less stay on the bike if you're a passenger. The whole concept of YET ANOTHER SECRET AGENCY to justify sending an assassin (who has NOT ONE line of dialgoue and his presence is just there to be the EVIL BOUNTY HUNTER WITH AN ASIAN SNEER) into the story at the end was ludicrous and when the film ends, it JUST ENDS with no sense of connection to the overall map the Bourne series created. Ed Norton's character comes in out of nowhere and all he does is bark orders--the one scene where he interacts with Renner's character is limp and doesn't explain much. But the film seems to care less about explanations and just wants to push you to the final act. Even the film's opening just has you going \\"HUH?\\" as they never really explain the point of Renner being in the snowy wonderland other than it being an \\"exercise.\\" An exercise in what? The use of a pretty environment? The saving graces of this film are Renner and Wiesz. Both are gifted actors and lots of fun to watch. Everyone else is so cookie-cutter that they barely register except to be mean to our tortured leads who hopefully sail into more peaceful waters without a return to the screen. Quit while you're now slightly behind and go find some other spy series to adapt....and please leave Tom Cruise off the casting couch!

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|One can see Pixar's John Lasseter's hand on this film. It is excellent, and a breath of fresh fun that was lost in the movie Brave, which was unfortunately a politically correct film for kids.<br /><br />The story is entertaining: Ralph is the bad guy in a video game, but he is lonely and wants to be appreciated. Obviously, he has a great heart buried inside the vilain image. So he goes out on a and aventure to get a golden medal (his passport to acceptance), visits other video games and finds a good friend on a little cyber girl. He reminded me a lot of Sully, the big guy in Monsters,Inc and his love for the Boo kid.<br /><br />However, it is not the story that is the best part of the movie, but the whole construction of an universe. Lasseter has done it before with the Toys that wake up and interact in Toy Story (a whole movie taking part on a kindergarten), a little fish challenging the great ocean in Nemo, etc. This kind of unusual settings have always been the strength of Pixar. This time, we see a world inside the electronic boards of video games in  an arcade shop. The characters move around each game through the wires and use the electrical outlets as a train station. I can imagine these script guys thinking about this idea while laughing and having a good time around a beer.<br /><br />The movie has a good pace, there is always something different happening, and the fact that kids can recognize beloved characters such as Pacman, Bowser and Sonic only helps.<br /><br />My kids loved it, highly recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!!!! I couldn't stop reading... EVER! I definitely recommend this book to anyone who has read the first book of the Hunger Games Trilogy!
0765325950|4.0|Having finished the last volume of Wheel of Time, which was satisfactory or better in how it finally ended the series, my only thought was that the estate should authorize an abridged version, cutting the whole thing down to four or five books.<br /><br />I just checked torrent activity for Memories of Light, and this book is a HIT, with the leading torrent offering both an iBook and Kindle version - talk about better service.  I suspect that many, many illegal downloaders would have purchased a Kindle copy had one been available.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is fun but also makes you use your brain.  I love these puzzle games. Keep up the good work and keep  them coming!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Such an unexpected delight!  So glad I read this before seeing the movie. I was so drawn into the story I could not put it down.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This may be Wes Anderson's best film yet. The action centers around two preteens who run away from home. Even though we know a bittersweet ending is coming, we can't help but root for Sam and Suzy as they escape from Sam's looming commitment to an orphanage and Suzy's dysfunctional family. They stave off the ambiguities and compromises of adulthood for a couple of days (if Suzy's parents are what adults are like, count me out), but we know they can't hold out forever. Somehow it all works out through the magic of Wes Anderson.<br /><br />A great movie for anybody who remembers wondering if becoming a grownup is worth the trouble, especially those on the other side of adolescence who still aren't sure.
B001NTUDVI|5.0|Bought this item twice cd also mp3 and loved it both times.  Mimi is my girl and purchase was great too.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|I was anxious to get the CD based on some small clips I noticed while watching a Jeff Lynne documentary I recently saw. I had no idea that I would go this crazy over this CD. I got it for Christmas along with a stack of CDs that I listened to. Of all of the CDs I got I was surprised that this was \\"the cream that rose to the top\\". I knew Jeff was multi-talented, that would be no surprise to any ELO fan or owners of Armchair Theater....but this was quite a feat. Jeff took songs from a by-gone era that I would never have given a thought to and showed that a strong melody trumps everything else.  A couple of songs (only because they came from the 60's) feel slightly out of place with the rest of these old standards but I am glad he attached them and did not leave them unreleased. This CD will always have a special place within my ever growing music collection.
0765325950|5.0|After all these years, couldn't wait for Amazon delivery, had to have it immediately.  I'm glad I did...I certainly understand and sympathize with those upset by the absence of a kindle edition, but there was really no shot I wouldn't spend the extra $$ to finish up what has been a twenty year wait.<br /><br />The genius of Robert Jordan was in the conceptualizing of a fully formed universe that so many of us were intrigued by.  That being said, there seems to be little dispute that the \\"middle\\" books to the series ultimately seemed unfocused, the characters somewhat flat and undeveloped and the plotlines diverging beyond control.  While I have no doubt that Mr. Jordan would have brought it all back into focus, his successor has done an extraordinary job of complementing the authors vision over the past three novels.<br /><br />Mat, Rand, Perrin...all of our old friends really, have matured and Brandon has given them flesh and emotion.  Where Mr. Jordan excelled in plotting, Brandon has been able to add his unique voice and prose and the end result is a very satisfying \\"tie-up\\" of all those loose ends.  And while I don't deny that I have many many questions left, I am very satisfied that the Wheel of Time has been brought full circle and the story completed.<br /><br />Unlike one other reviewer though, I would have appreciated a brief epilogue (though not a Harry Potter-like one) to see how our friends fared going forward and I guess I'll have to hope that though the Wheel of Time has closed, perhaps other stories set in this rich world will continue.
B00A19FMRQ|5.0|In UN Waris said... In our country we have a proverb \\"The last camel in the line walks as quickly as the first. What ever happens to the least of us has an effect on all of us.\\"<br /><br />Some 150 million  women and girls as young as three year old around the world have experienced the procedure called Female genital mutilation (FGM)plus some 8,000 more a day, every single day. Waris Dirie is the chosen one to speak for all those who can not speak about FGM. How Waris survived an unbelievable punishment and journey to get where she is and proudly speak as a woman is nothing short of magical. Wish Waris health and happiness. Bravo, bravo, bravo.

0345457692|5.0|It's the distant future. Man has spread out among the stars, and defeated death through digitization. Most people have cortical stacks, storage hardwired into their brain which captures their state in real-time, and allows that state to be transferred to and from computers.<br /><br />Takeshi Kovacs is a former Envoy, a highly-trained agent specializing in assimilating new cultures and 'solving problems.' Kovacs was in mandatory storage as punishment for a crime spree, but his sentence was bought out by Laurens Bancroft, a Meth - a human who has lived so long and become so powerful he is effectively immortal. Bancroft supposedly killed himself, resulting in the loss of two days of memories before he was restored into a new clone. Bancroft doesn't believe it, and so Kovacs job is to figure out what really happened, in the face of a culture he doesn't understand, surrounded by people who don't want him to succeed, and a smattering of old enemies who want him dead.<br /><br />This was one of the most enjoyable sci-fi reads I've had in ages. The writing is excellent, the characters are interesting, and there's a LOT of different sci-fi concepts melded together, along with a story that shows the up and down side of things which you wouldn't normally have considered, ranging from immortality to interstellar travel. The characters are fairly believable, and the story kept me guessing all the way through.<br /><br />In short, a great book. I loved it, and am looking forward to reading the next in the series!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The movie was beautiful and the behind the scenes bonus features were very interesting and also educational. I loved learning how the actors worked in the set based on the theater in France.
B005F3GMAO|4.0|Really enjoyed reading this book, very insightful and humbling to learn about how much Richard accomplished so young! Unfortunately the book was almost divided into two halves though, with the first half well written, in chronological order and easy to follow. The second half of the book was obviously written in a rush and seemed to jump constantly between topics, dates and locations so much harder to follow.<br />Would highly recommend reading the first half but unfortunately not such a strong ending.
B007TK77QE|3.0|This is a tough book in which JK Rowling clearly wants to distance herself from our perception of her as a children's writer. It is not a pleasant read, but nevertheless grips, entertains, and asks hard questions about the complacency of English society as we know it. The language is uncompromising, and Rowling never lets her reader off the hook. Her characters are sharply drawn, whether smug rural know-alls or abused kids. Drugs course through the veins of the story, poisoning lives and feeding predjudice. The book hurts, and we learn from it that Rowling, for sure, can write about a great deal more than fantasy.
B0098460O4|5.0|This CD is wonderful, Charlotte sings so beautifully,I believe Jonathan is world class,one of the best operatic voices ever,I have really enjoyed listening to it,Jonathan has such power and control in his voice,it is a beautifully put together CD,I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.
B0063GORYU|5.0|There is only one game that is to beatable and I haven't come across it yet.  This is an enjoyable way to pass the time.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|This game developer really asks in the shop for 65 dollars to get a load of monkey dollars who in their right mind would pay that much for a game like this. the game over all is fun but gets very annoying when you lose a level even with tons of agents supped  up towers like spike factories all over. then all of your monkey dollars go away making the game all the more playable for not just hours but days. The upgrade system it needs lots of work.Try spitting in the ocean to raise the sea level seems a lots more sense then upgrading things by 2%. Either developer needs to make it more than eight upgrades like up to 15 or more. Now the system for reducing upgrade and more for activating property was a leap forward.

0307744434|4.0|This book was recommended to me from a friend of mine. The premise of the Night Circus is very interesting and the writing entertaining. I will say I felt the end was a bit anti-climactic, but overall a good read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I truly understand understand Charlie's perspective and by which he saw all things around him.  It's was a beautiful read
0141182865|5.0|Toole's posthumously published novel is one that makes me laugh even thinking about it. His witty writing and larger than life characters are enough to win anyone over. An absurd read that is guaranteed to make you chuckle.
0684823454|5.0|Most people know of Winston Churchill because of his role in World War II and the Cold War.  In this book Churchill describes his first thirty years in his own words, in vivid detail from his recollections of his first thoughts as a small child to his daring escape from a prison camp during the Boer War.  He had more life experiences in his first thirty years than most people have in a lifetime.  I truly enjoyed reading this book.
0553384775|5.0|This book was recommended to me when I was vacationing in New Zealand by a random person I met on my trip. Little did I know that Hollywood would be soon turning it into a movie. The book is a fun read and a wild ride. For a good time, and a look into Wall Street excess of the late 90s, read The Wolf of Wall Street.

B0055PGUYU|4.0|Good documentation on why we, as humans, do what we do and then how to stop, if it is a bad habit.  The book contains both &#34;real life&#34; examples as well as scientific studies and evidence to back it up.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Well acted. I'm usually not a fan of prequels, but this one was well done. I've watched it several times already.
0937381888|4.0|This is my go-to book for home brewing.  However, the pictures and some of the content needs to be updated as the pictures are pretty old looking and the overall feel of the book just feels dated.  An updated edition would make this book 5 stars all the way.

B009FB3WQ4|5.0|Good quality dvd with good content--buy anything with one of her live performances.  The program content wasn't all that great.  Hard for many present day entertainers to even come close in matching her stature.  How do you do a tribute to a true living legend?
0374531943|5.0|Michael Collins has a genuine gift with prose; he describes precisely and with flair, has a deadpan wit that can be as dry as the desert and as innocent as a lamb, and is simply the finest writer of the Mercury-Gemini-Apollo astronauts. His book gives a first-hand account not only of the selection process that he endured, but the hectic, colorful, Astro-A-Go-Go world of Houston in the Sixties.<br /><br />He somehow resists the urge to turn his story into self-adulation, bully pulpit, or tedium; an urge that seemingly overpowered many of his fellow astronauts when they 'wrote' their own books. His 'reporter's eye' and droll wit is especially surprising in someone that is a military academy graduate, career officer (he retired with great distinction as a lieutenant general), and a trained engineer.<br /><br />Collin's description of the training and flight of Gemini 10 with 'Corned Beef' John Young is vivid and arresting. His narration of his space walk is so entrancing that it settled the question -- at least, for me -- what it was truly like 'up there'.<br /><br />Apollo 11, the Big Enchilada, is one of the book's finest segments. Collins gives readers such a sense of belonging to the mission themselves that it is irresistible. He describes the training in the simulators, the torture in the 'Vomit Comet' and the 'G-Wheel', and how it was to work with Armstrong and Aldrin. In this last, he is frank and candid. As he notes, it is difficult to have so many 'overachieving sons of overachievers' working together without some friction. He relates a small flare between the other two, after a 'crash' on the lunar surface during simulator training. This incident later appeared, nearly verbatim in the magnificent Tom Hanks 'From Earth to Moon' series.<br /><br />Collins also takes particular care to pay homage and respect to the most unappreciated and neglected of the astronaut's support system -- his wife, Patricia. By the way, he and Patricia are still married (to each other), for about a half century, having been married at Chambley, France, which happens to be where I was born. Although I doubt that the two events are related. At least, one hopes so.<br /><br />This book also has the advantage of giving color and life to other books about the space program, particularly Andrew Chaikin's wonderful 'A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts', and Gene Kranz's 'Failure Is Not An Option'.<br /><br />Collins has that most difficult-to-exercise gift of the writer -- what to leave on the cutting room floor. I always found myself feeling, as I do with a great actor, of wanting just a little more. He never over-explains, and his description, even of the most prosaic and mundane things, is terse, apt, and still vibrant and vivid. I believe that he could write a pilot's checklist and make it absorbing. This is one of the books that I buy in bulk, and give away. Not only is it a record of a fascinating time in history, but it is a fine example of how such a tale should be written.<br /><br />A small aside about the humor in the book; there is a footnote regarding radio procedures among fighter pilots that is simply one of the funniest things that I've ever read. How many footnotes have ever made you laugh aloud? I read the book (in one sitting, I might add, and yes -- it's that good) while occupying a booth next to a plate-glass window in a tavern during an afternoon of mixed thundershowers and blasting sunlight. When I read that particular bon mot, I roared, causing the other customers to stare and the waitress to bring me a glass of water and ask if I were all right.<br /><br />I also owe a personal debt to Michael Collins. My brilliant and beautiful wife, Diane, are getting ready to retire. When our financial adviser asked me to describe my goals for a perfect retirement, I thought for a moment, and paraphrased something that Collins had said in his magnificent book: \\"Sitting on the porch in the evening, and talking to my wife.\\"

B0083TXXZ4|4.0|My son really likes his Hail Fire Blaster as do his older brothers and dad.  He's 6 and while the gun seems a bit big, he is able to operate it.  My only complaint was I didn't realize this did not come with all the nerf bullets.  There is an additional starter pack you need to purchase to have all the fire power.  Furthermore, the bullets do not jam as easily as some of our other nerf guns do.

B004QX07G4|5.0|I was reading this book at work and would actually laugh out loud at some parts.  My co-workers thought I was losing it!  I don't usually do that with any reading material but I could just picture her saying and doing everything she wrote.  I am a big fan of her comedy, her style is so unusual and refreshingly honest.  She doesn't need vulgar language to get laughs and I just might have to go back and read the books (2) that she wrote before writing this one.  If you need a good belly laugh or if something in life has you down this book will lift your spirits as it did mine.  Thanks Ellen I needed that!

0765325950|5.0|Leaving a one star review simply because you didn't get your precious e-book?!?!?!?! Childish in my opinion, reviews that have nothing to do with the CONTENT of the product should at the very least be sorted into a different category, if not removed all together(and yes that includes this one).  That said, as a fan of Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson and in support of them I am leaving a five star review simply to protest this \\"it's-all-about-me\\" childishness!!!!!

B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Best video player I've found for Kindle Fire thus far. Let's you play basically every movie format out there from windows video to .FLV format. Best thing is that it's free!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|The game itself is very addictive, but would repeatedly freeze. I would restart this game dozens of times per day. Not once did I exit the game on my own. It froze every time. Many times after only a minute. I played everyday for weeks, even getting up in the middle of the night when an egg was due to hatch. The final straw was when I purchased coins and within an hour the game froze and erased my entire village. I had hundreds of hours invested and used millions of coins building my village. I had expanded 10 times, completed more than 20 families and even had 2 T-Rexes. If you have played, you will understand how much time it takes to get that far. I am very very upset over this. If I had wrote a review yesterday, I would have given it five stars for the game itself, but after having my entire game wiped out, I have no choice but to give it one star. At this point, even one is to much. I wish I had never bothered with this game.
B002RI9L76|5.0|I've read this before as a kid and always remember it being a great read. Thankfully it's still just as I remember it!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is great for all ages.  Toddlers love to smash the groceries while teens and adults enjoy &quot;playing&quot; the game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Easy read. Keeps you enthralled from start to finish. You feel Katie 's fear and paranoia. Another great one from Nicholas Sparks.
B005LAII12|1.0|Very nasty movie.  I would not recommend it to anybody.  I still have it and cannot give it away.  Nobody wants it.<br />I would like to sell it, but amazon would not list it.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|This game is very addictive. Very cute animals and lots of fun attractions. Give it a try.also a fun way to waste some time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It could not have been any better; I suggest everyone to read this book.<br />You won't regret it I promise
B0083P1QUM|2.0|As a fan of Cornwell, as well as the Scarpetta series, I feel her earlier books were more about the mystery and the crime. Her last three Scarpetta books have been more about technology and less about suspense. She should go back to a style that began this journey.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I had seen the movie first, thought it was good, but wasn't impressed.<br />I sampled the book and read the first chapter so fast, I bought it immediately. I am now almost finished with the final book.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|i really love love it get and its protective and it doesnt need a strap even better reall recemend it get it
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Very happy with my purchase. Phillip is very talented and I can't wait for his next CD. Live, love, love
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Me and my son played this game until 1:30 in the morning! We loved it! The graphics were great and scary.....Honestly we jumped several times in the game and at one point i had 3 children beside me helping me. I would reccomend this game to anyone!
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Who, What, When and Where, these are the questions you will ask yourself as you set and watch<br />this movie until the very end. Beware make sure you do not hit the Pause Button, as for you do not<br />want to miss one second of this movie! Bruce you are getting Old Man,but we all are and I will always<br />be a fan of his movies. Okay so you know i like this movie. The Trailers do not do this movie Justice.<br />Just wait and see!!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm not a big fan to reading the whole book to find out there is no ending. Why 3 books? Is it about the money or the story???
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Oh he was not replaced, but it is like taking Sly out of Rambo or Rocky! So this movie<br />was really good! Matt would have played a better role since it is his movie right. This is not like<br />a Super Hero Movie where the Characters can be played by anyone.<br /><br />Have Fun and enjoy the movie!
B0073LWEXK|4.0|It's a pretty good game and can be challenging; the youngest requested the game and really likes it. Based on that alone I would recommend.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Colin Farell is not Mr. Universe by any means and to be honest<br />I was holding back on watching this movie in the Theaters because<br />Colin has never struck me as a Bad Ass!  But I will give him Full Respect<br />for this Movie. Do not under estimate this movie by any means. If you watched the<br />1st Recall with Arnold Swartztoomanyletters  &#60; close enough;)  then you will not<br />be disappointed! Okay so i will be the first to admit,this is hands down a much<br />better movie the second time around.. Could be the fact that CGI is much more believable,<br />or they just did a much better job at the Plot, but there is no way I would bare to watch another action<br />movie with Arnold again! He will  be back, NOOOOO!!
B008KE3960|3.0|It's ok and can be challenging; the youngest requested the game and really likes it. Based on that alone I would recommend.
B0073QWCAA|5.0|My main concern with this set was that it would have issues with my US Region 1 Blu Ray Player.  I saw mixed reviews and was concerned but for the lower cost decided to take a risk.  I'm glad I did.  It works perfectly on my Sony BDP-S570.  This Blu Ray is definitely superior quality to the DVD version.  I will definitely look for region free Blu Rays for my future movie purchases.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the final installment of the series.  It wrapped up the plot points and gave everyone a happy ending though it does not reveal Mia's future.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|Graphically violent, but brilliant. Gosling is quietly magnetic, while the villains, played by Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman, manage to be hilarious and frightening at the same time. Read the book when it came out and thought it was so-so. But a great Hollywood production team performed magic.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I'm not great at falling asleep and this app definitely helps. I love being able to choose my own sounds and mix them together. Very tranquil. Highly recommended.
B002YCVX5S|2.0|There were some nice set pieces in Inglourious Basterds (German soldiers playing pub games while the resistance plots at a nearby table) but they tended to drag on. Two and a half hours? How long is the director's cut?<br /><br />The gratuitous bloodshed, ridiculous story and over-the-top acting sent the missus off to bed after the first hour and I had to watch the rest of the movie by myself. Thanks, Quentin. If I want solitude, I'll read a book.
B007RTAR64|4.0|This doll reflects my grandaughter's personality.  She likes dolls but they must be &#34;tuf&#34; dols.  She was imidiatly surprized and thrilled.  She especially likes thr bow & arrows.
0345536886|3.0|The story isn't too bad: three ambulance-chasers get in over their heads after launching a class-action lawsuit against a pharmaceutical giant.  The characters could have been interesting, as well. Grisham certainly knows his lawyers. But he blows it all to smithereens in the first hundred pages by trying way too hard to be funny.  It's like sitting in a comedy club and watching some poor devil dying on stage.  Painful.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this app.  It's relaxing, easy to use, and has significantly improved my sleep in just one week. I look forward to using this while reading, exercising and knitting as well as while working.
0385535147|2.0|In an author's note, Grisham says that he did no research for this book. He didn't bother with character development or atmosphere either. Just the bare bones of a story, by a writer who must be as bored as his readers. Sad that the man who wrote A Time to Kill has sunk so low.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|This was a gift and the receiver said it was a good movie.<br />He especially liked the fact that it was a blue-ray disc.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|This first novel by Chris Pavone shows lots of promise. The European locales are compelling and the characters are well-realized. But the narrative in this domestic twist on the spy novel never really takes off -- too much to-ing and fro-ing -- and the denouement falls flat. Looking forward to his next book.
B009MF56GC|4.0|This was a gift and the receiver said it was a good movie.<br />He especially liked the fact that it was a blue-ray disc.
B0012NVGHU|4.0|A movie for those who remember -- or would like to remember -- what it was like to be young, when love was confusing, life was a challenge and music really meant something. And for all you old folkies out there. Enjoy! It doesn't get any better than this.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Perfect!  This product is exactly what the explaination said it would be.  I love it and I would buy another one.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|A visually powerful and emotionally unsettling film. Viewers need patience (or a doobie) for the first half hour or so, but this movie is worth the effort. And, like any great work of art, we will all take away something different.<br /><br />At the heart of the film is a story we can all relate to.  Many of us were too involved in our own adolescent struggles to pay much attention to what our younger siblings were going through. And, like Jack, to this day we regret our failures as older brothers and sisters.<br /><br />A moment that will resonated strongly is when the father apologizes to Jack for being too harsh. His response is, it's your house, you can do what you want. The youthful Jack isn't yet capable of forgiveness, but he's taking the first steps on a long journey - separateness, tolerance, and eventually acceptance - that Sean Penn continues in the final scenes.<br /><br />Some wag - I forget who - wrote that Malick doesn't seem to care much for people, but he obviously never met a tree he didn't like. The visuals that stay with me aren't the cosmic pyrotechnics, but Waco's trees - an enormous diffusing canopy, enclosing the timeless, mythical world of childhood.
B008Y6YLBG|1.0|It was not clear to me that this movie's purpose is to educate us about the effect of methamphetamines in rural communities, as other reviewers have said, or I wouldn't have watched it. It turned out to be about how a girl survives with a sick mother, two little siblings and no father, in an area where, other than her neighbor and one friend, everyone is evil and horrible to her. Very depressing. The girl's acting was ok, but the story was terrible. It makes Missouri look like an awful place with terrible people. I've been to Missouri, and I thought people were all nice and happy, not ugly, fat and depressed like the people in this movie. The homes are a lot prettier and happier, and yes, they do have running water! Missouri people ought to complain. Perhaps the book is a lot a better. I'm sorry I wasted my time with this movie.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|The music is awesome, the artists are very creative. Got this album after listening to a few songs on Pandora. Glad I did so.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is great, so adicting. Get this game now. I love getting power ups, head starts,  and new people.
B00A9X9VAI|3.0|Not exactly what I expected. A little darker and kind of sad, I suppose. But, it was good with an interesting ending.
0618871713|5.0|This probing journey into the life of the author's father, poses two dramatic questions:  was he gay? and did he commit suicide? It also is a loving portrait of a man, from the viewpoint of his daughter.  Ms. Bechdel is fortunate to have the ability to see her parents as people outside of the role models that most of us develop.  Most parents remain Mom and Dad and hold a power over our lives that continually keep the average son or daughter in a subserviant role.  It is often rare when one gets to know one's parents as individuals, as friends; as fellow traveller's in the journey of life.  This graphic study, so beautifully executed, takes us into his personal life, not just with his daughter.  It's a compelling, sympathetic journey, that brings the reader along, creating images to ponder, as artful and deep as the dialogue.  A truly beautiful book, not to be dismissed as a mere comic, but right up there along comedy's sister, tragedy.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|i like it...<br />abc  caskdhk sad sdjhsj sd ss sds  sdskd sdsk sd s s s ds sdskd sd sd s
B003DT194G|5.0|This is arguably the best sphagetti western out there behind the The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. All of the four main characters all have their own agenda or goals. The story mainly focuses on Jill after her family is brutally slain by Frank (Henry Fonda), while Harmonica (Charles Bronson) has a personal vendetta against him. Then there's Cheyenne who is initially blamed for killing Jill's family, eventually all these characters bump heads with one another, leading to confrontations with one another. Thank You Sergio Leone for leaving us yet another western classic.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it's addicting and challenging. I play it on my downtimes when I'm waiting to pick up friends. the best game

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I CHOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE IT WAS INTENSE AND OVER POWERING AND INTRIGUING. I DIDN'T DISLIKE ANYTHING. I LOVED IT ALL..AND I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE A SENSE OF IMAGINATION LIKE I DO AND SEX DRIVE...MMMMM

B000002KHF|5.0|I originally bought this for Into the Mystic song.  I love this CD.  If you are a Van fan, this is the CD you will love.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Different humor but very enjoyable. Great characters, funny plot, interesting humor. Not for young children. Always in for a good Mark film
0439023491|5.0|I loved these books.  I never saw the movie but I could not put these books down.  The second was a little slow I thought but on a whole very enjoyable.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Watched this movie with family, quality download and good movie. Told the book was good as well so read it watch it
B005WUHAX8|1.0|After 14 days of use, my wife dropped her phone today and the Lifeproof case cracked. How does something called &#34;LifeProof&#34; crack at only 2 weeks old? Not to mention the fact that every phone conversation sounds like she is in a barrel. OtterBox, here we come!
B007SGM084|3.0|The language is terrible!  The story itself is terrible!  I'd be ashamed to sign my name as author.  I have read many &#34;dirty&#34; books in my lifetime.  Somehow, I find this story disgusting.  If such things go on in life, and they do, I don't need 3 volumes going into detail about it.  I am reading it because I wanted to see why it had gained such notoriety  Only reading the book will explain that!!This book has SHOCK VALUE!!!!!  That is why the author will be making money on the sales!!!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|the side slots are BS! You never win. very frustrating.<br />20 spins and 0 wins really? #$%! uyuhf drag khigdb7 uhggg gdfgg
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Masterpiece Theatre does it again! This is a most see series, wonderful story line, characters and actors. I highly recommend this.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|TV shows are very rarely that good. This is one of my favorite along with Six Feet Under.<br /><br />Good evening!
1451662432|3.0|This jumbo autobiography suffers from a little bit too much recall.  Some compression throughout, especially in the early pages about bodybuilding in the 1960s, would have been a plus.  Also, the style of writing is somewhat flat and Arnold's wonderful sense of humor does not really come through.  The book merits a strong three-star rating, however, because it is an excellent primer on how to succeed in life.  Arnold recognized early on that he would be good at bodybuilding and that he should go to America to do it.  His focus on these goals, as well as on movie-making, is single-minded and never waivers, and he certainly had a knack for being in the right place at the right time.  He knew how to make circumstances work for him.  Along the way, he seems to have met everybody who was anybody.  It's such a wonderful success story that it is a shame it was not better written, but then writing was not his forte.  You might say that &#34;life&#34; is his forte, and he lives it to the fullest.  Just how, is amply illustrated in this book.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|unless i turn the kindle to a weird angle - waste of time - unless i haven't figured it out
B000OVLBFS|5.0|I am a huge Tom Selleck fan and love all of the Jesse Stone movies - a little slow but I still enjoy them.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|DragonVale is the best and cutest game I've seen in awhile. It doesn't demand you come back at a certain time like some continuous games and delivers lots of cool and cute graphics!
B008R14YBK|5.0|just what my grand daughter wanted for xmas - - - - - - - - - - - thanks
B0050LJIRK|5.0|I listen to this CD over and over, I can't get enough of it. I got a used copy and I appears as good as new.
B002ZG9846|5.0|This is basically real life super heros made into a movie. It shows that an average man/boy can make a difference in the world. Even in a stupid costume.
B00A5052YE|5.0|THIS GIRL IS ON FIRE!! I have been listening to AK since she first hit the music scene with Fallin', every album AK has put out has been a joy to listen to and I especially love this album because it shows how much she has grown as a woman and she is excellent at relating that to her fans. Of all her albums I must say this one is quickly moving up to the top of my list as a favorite.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Ill keep this short and sweet. Audio and video is of top quality. If you love kind of braindead action, and a typical comic book story. This is the movie for you.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Wow what a roller coaster.  I'm glad the author described what he was doing at the end of the book, because I was wondering why a lot of main characters weren't in the spotlight.<br /><br />Loved it!
B003ICWTTM|5.0|I liked that the DVD was a great price and it was shipped right away and arrived in time christmas.  My father loved it!<br /><br />Many thanks!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Awesome episode that I can watch whenever I want. Can't wait for the next season. This is easily my favorite show
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I did not want to get hooked on this, but I am.  I can hardly wait for the next episode!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|All I wanted was a simple calculator, and this freebie fills the bill. It isn't complicated, but it is sophisticated!
B004GVUPFE|1.0|not as fun as i though. hard to move pieces around. needs improvment big time. i havn't really played it since i got it
B00A757EFW|4.0|not used much, but the kids love it.  the kindle it's on, sucks<br />this site is beginning to suck, more words, more words, what do you want??
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|im in love with season 1 and season 2 of american horror story.<br /><br />its by far the best non reality show on tv..
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Who doesn't love a good love story?  This book was great and held my interest.  I usually don't like the love story stuff but Nicholas Sparks has a way to make it not so sappy.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|As a facilitator of a Job Networking Group this is one of the best and most often used resources we use and discuss in our meetings.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was amazing I really liked the ending, it wasn't like the other 2 books in the series but all in all it was a great read.
B006X415GK|4.0|I bought this doll for my daughter.  She enjoys playing with it and all the others that we have purchased.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Wow, Heartbreakingly beautifully. It will stay with you long after you finish the last page.One of my favorites so far.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Graphics and story are well done. But gameplay too easy to justify paying for it. Best G5 I've tried. I tend to be more a big fish fan :)
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|As always Picoult's writing is very descriptive, but this particular novel flips back and forth in time but not very fluently.  But true to form this novel makes you ponder what would you do?.........<br />Her novels fiction based on fact are mostly riveting.
B005Q1W10A|1.0|It would not work in my DVD player and so I was very glad I had borrowed it from a friend! I would love to have that money back.
1451695195|5.0|This book was very enlightening.  I found it very interesting and would recomend it to anyone.  It is well written and thought provoking.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great movie to curl up on the couch with the boyfriend and watch. Not a dull moment in the whole movie.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|OMG! Where do I begin? I suppose my first mistake was to have high expectations, after all, it is Ridley Scott. But bad scripting, juvenile storyline (complete with an evil industrialist), and inexcusably bad science make this a movie to miss. Sorry Noomi, I loved you in the Swedish version of Girl with a Dragon Tatoo but you were just mis-cast in this role and certainly no Sigourney Weaver. This movie felt like a money grab. Come on Scotts, you are capable of so much better.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My child loved this movie and I enjoyed watching it with her =) i reccomend this movie for all little girls and mommies to watch
B0011NVC98|2.0|i rented this in 2008 (the good ol days when Hollywood video was in business) i wanted to see this, i got less interested because i did not know it was performance capture, i am not a fan of the Robert Zemeckis performance capture films me and my mom are the 1 in 3 people who didnt enjoy Polar Express, i barely liked anything in this movie back then, i thought watching it now i could like it more i still dont, this is one of those times when i finish the movie feeling nothing
B00003CXB4|5.0|I purchased this move for my 5 yr old son, he loves Simba!!! It was a great gift and I'm glad he is enjoying it!!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|The action just kept coming. I really never wanted to put the book down. Describing the roads in Iowa, Nebraska, and Oklahoma was a bit over the top. Although, I have driven those roads and it was accurate.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This DVD combo is a typical snap-in case with 3 discs. Not much else to say about the packaging. It was a great movie.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This was a quick and enjoyable read. I liked some of the twists and turns. I don't love series books, but I will probably read all of the others. I'm sure my teens will also enjoy it.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|The alarm is ok. I wish the volume was louder and you could hear the ring options prior to setting the alarm up. I'm a HEAVY SLEEPER, and some of the ring options are low even with the volume blaring.<br /><br />Overall, it's  a free alarm.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|great graphics. easy enough to play.  entertaining. and the game still progresses easily without spending real cash. good job creators. more games need to be made where people don't have to pay for stuff to enjoy the game.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Extremely interesting especially the parts about WWI and its battles.  The diverse characters added to the story-line.<br />Ken Follette at his best.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love the Batman Dark Knight Trilogy movies. The package came and the box looks even cooler in person. The case has a smooth almost suede like feel to it. The book that comes with it has tons of artwork and behind the scenes information. I had a blast reading it. If you're a fan you have to buy this! I recommend it to anyone who's a fan and to anyone who knows a fan-this would be a great gift!
B005HSL626|5.0|My grand daughter put this on my Kindle and plays it when she comes visit, along with other games on it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I have read all three books and you need to read them in order to follow the story.  Thoughts on this series seems to be fall into &#34;love it&#34; or &#34;hate it&#34;.  To each his own.  I really enjoyed most of the characters and thought the author brought them to life.  As a citizen of the United States, and a native English speaker, some of the book was hard for me follow, for example the Swedish names of places, but I never had a problem with the plot or characters.  By the end of the series I wanted to visit Sweden.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Again, my grand daughter plays this on my Kindle when she is at my house.  She loves playing the games

0789318245|3.0|The information provided is a really fun read, but other reviews are correct in that it doesn't have completely accurate depictions of the artist's flash. Some look to be done in crayon. Give me the real artwork, and this book is perfect.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|With tablets and mobile devices becoming a bigger and bigger part of society, people are beginning to want to take their favorite applications (or close alternatives) with them when they're not around their desktops or laptops... One of the major examples of this is an application to create, edit, and share various documents and presentations. Though it is a huge matter of preference towards one application or another, it's obvious that this is one of the best. With most other mobile office suites, all you'll typically get is a watered-down document editor that doesn't provide much functionality.<br /><br />With OfficeSuite, however, it's quite the opposite. I have yet to fully explore all of the options, but I'm no less than satisfied so far. There's so many options for formatting text in Word documents, and creating PowerPoint presentations. It's awesome. I do find it sad that there's a very small handful of applications that actually have a feature set this large, but I'm glad I found this app.<br /><br />I do have one *small* complaint though: Fonts.<br /><br />The list of included fonts for documents is extremely small. There's only nine (9) fonts included. And if you would like more fonts to use, you have to pay another $5 to purchase a font package.<br /><br />Personally I would much rather that these fonts just be included, rather than trying to sap more money out of you for a necessary feature... It should've been included in the first place. That's my only complaint.<br /><br />Other than that, great application! I would definitely recommend this to friends and family.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|It's an interesting story about the life of one of the greatest men of our time. He was by no means perfect, in fact, he was a very difficult man to live with. But then again, most great artist are and it's those flaws, his quirks, eccentricities, perfectionism and instinct etc were what combined into something him extraordinary. He truly is a visionary, artsist, genius. Despite what people think of him, be Apple fans or not, you can't deny that he truly made a dent in the universe and change our way of life.
0307596885|5.0|Complex characters slowly revealed, allowing the reader to participate. Aways original and suprising.  Munro's writing is so beautiful, I often re-read each sentence simply to savor HOW she says what she's saying, on many levels
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Just as great as I had hoped! If you are a Rod Stewart fan, this is a must! If you are just looking for a nice Christmas CD, this one is the best. There is something for everyone on it. The songs are smooth, soulful & fun.

B0073O0AME|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He loved it and we watch it when we want to enjoy good music and some great wine. Out friends and nieghbors all enjoy as well when we play it during a get together.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is one of the few that I can unreservedly recommend. It has a story that was fun to follow, a very industrious sign writer, and intriguing, creative puzzles. I am almost always angered by apps and app producers and hardly ever enamored by them. This game was one delight in an otherwise dark, dismal world of disappointing app design. If the app world followed this game's example, I wouldn't have this creeping doubt that I made a mistake whenever I downloaded an app. At the moment, I would prefer to play console games instead of being burned by app designers over and over again.<br /><br />I only mention this to highlight how wonderful it was to purchase this app and how pleased I am with it. That and I am very angry at most other companies out there who should seek some type of penitence for the pain they have engendered. If 2D Boy comes out with other apps, they have my business. Hats off to you.

B005BE79YA|5.0|I have read Hermann Hesse's novella Siddhartha several times and have enthusiastically recommended it here on Amazon.  I was worried that the film version would not do justice to Hesse's wonderful short novel.  My concern was not warranted.  While the film is not perfect and some purists will object to liberties director Conrad Rooks has taken with the story, for the most part the film is true to Hesse's intention.<br /><br />The film begins with the young Indian Brahmin Siddhartha telling his friend Govinda that he will leave his comfortable home and live among the Samanas, a group noted for its stoic and ascetic way of life.  Govinda joins his friend and for several years they meditate and mortify their flesh, but in the end Siddhartha tells Govinda that this path is not right for him.  They leave the Samanas and soon after meet the Buddha.  Govinda decides to remain with the Buddha, but Siddhartha must find his own path to enlightenment.<br /><br />Now Siddhartha enters the world of the common people.  A beautiful courtesan he meets introduces him to a wealthy and successful merchant.  Siddhartha goes to work for the merchant and quickly becomes rich and successful, but after many years of love with the courtesan and service for the merchant, Siddhartha finds only disillusionment.  One day he simply leaves his home and work.  Much older and sadder, but not wiser, he goes to the river and is taken in by a ferryman.  Slowly Siddhartha becomes one with the river and attains enlightenment.  In the end, his old friend Govinda joins him on the river and the story ends.<br /><br />Director Rooks treats this story with loving care.  All of the cast of actors he has assembled give thoughtful and nuanced performances.  Cinematographer Sven Nykvist succeeds in giving us a sense that we are in India 2,500 years ago as we walk in the footsteps of Siddhartha in his quest for understanding the meaning of his life.  Of special note is the music of Hemant Kumar, which is integrated into the main body of the film.  The music perfectly captures the mood director Rooks seeks to establish and gives the viewer just one more thing to like about this fine film.<br /><br />Siddhartha Gautama is the name of the Buddha, but this film is not about the Buddha or his teachings of Dependent Arising and Compassion.  Instead the Siddhartha of this story becomes a ferryman and finds in the river the mystery of the ever present now and the peace that comes from leaving behind the past and surrendering to the awareness of the present moment.  This film entertains and enlightens.  I highly recommend it.ed into the main body of the film.

B000002OAZ|5.0|Created at a time when the merging of English players and Chicago (and Southern) blues players was unheard of but totally cool. Steve Winwood, Clapton, and the Stones rhythm section were an incredible choice especially back then
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love how it shows the lives of both classes that live at Downton. Awesome scenery.<br />Hope there will be more seasons in the future!
B0012GMWCU|5.0|its great to hear the voice of the writer of so many classic blues hits for Muddy, Wolf, Little Walter,  and interpreted by the Brits as well as the next generation (passing so quickly) of blues greats like Buddy Guy and Junior Wells, James Cotton etc.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Although I never miss her show & I think the TV show is one of the best, I did not like the book.
1451695195|5.0|Finally a book where the author has enough professional prestige that the medical community will....may....take it seriously.  It is well written and I especially like the on-going research this author wants to conduct.  Well worth reading.
0765325950|5.0|Good stuff, i liked the look and feel of the book, also Sanderson did a great job with what he had, props to him.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I loved the array of characters developed in this story of village life. What an assortment of troubled souls!<br />Although it is not full of  \\"action\\", I found myself drawn into the lives of these folk and wanted to know how events would turn out. In that regard, it was a real page turner!A wonderful story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put the book down! Finished it in less than a week, the story sucks you in and you don't want out. A must read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best part of this game u will want to tell your friends about it and others u would love the sexy move
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My husband has this game on his iphone..I didn't understand why he loved it so much until I started playing it ! Now i'm addicted to this game, too!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I wasn't sure how this would go. But the scientific detail in the story is awesome! It makes the story SO real. I felt I was the one stranded on Mars having to think through everything, using my wits to survive. Turned out to be a great little read. Out of this world - Pun intended!
B008PZ69T8|5.0|This music is so wonderful and really enhances the book as I am reading the trilogy again. I wasn't a big fan of classical music but now have a better appreciation.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|The DVDs came really fast and they work really great. This show is awesome on its own so the DVDs working is an added bonus.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The most amazing true miracle story I have ever read.  No disputing the fact that Dr. Alexander was shown a glimpse of heaven and the awesome love of God.  I had seen interviews with Dr. Alexander on TV and could not get enough of his amazing experience so I bought the book.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone.<br /><br />Proof of Heaven is a must for every believer and especially unbeliever to read!
B003L77GH4|5.0|The DVDs came really fast and they work really great. This show is awesome on its own so the DVDs working is an added bonus.
143911000X|5.0|This was extremely funny.  To see a compilation of the saying at the end of the tv episodes was cool.
B000002IFP|5.0|Bought this for the 'If You Don't Know Me By Now' song that was sung by a local cover band Charlie and the Tunas, by Barney Armstrong. My husband, Irv Kellenberger played sax with the group and this was one of my favorites. The rest of the tunes on the CD were new to me but I like them, too.
B008YL7MSA|3.0|For all the hype the movie was kinda slow.  Neat concept just not to exciting.  Somewhet over-priced for what you got in the package.
B008J34466|5.0|Ordered & Received within 2 days! Fast - Amazon is the best.<br />The CD arrived in perfect shape, the music is great (as always-from P!nk)<br />If you like her music - it is classic P!nk. Bought it for myself - I recommend it for any adult (due to some language content - free speech is a good thing!)
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Looking forward to a getaway in the pages of such a classic novel. A great addition to the electronic library

B009KS4XRO|4.0|Game is great.  Sometimes freezes but other than that it's very entertaining.  I use it on my kindle fire.  Like the fact that you can play four cards at once.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Just didn't keep me interested like the first 2. I found it very hard to keep interested there just wasn't enough happening to keep me interested.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was very shocked with the explicit detail of the intimacy shared between Ana and Christian. But the part of the story that really caught my attention was the fact that Christian was adamant about not being touched on his chest. This book definitely has peaked my interest into finding out the details of the emotional and physical pain caused to Christian during his childhood that led to the lifestyle he has chosen to live. I am definitely going to read book 2.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Its angry birds and free!!!!!!  You cannot beat that combination.  Of course since I got the new Kindle Fire I had to download all my favorite things to it.
1451695195|4.0|We can all draw our own conclusions as to what happens on the other side of life and we can believe what we want but I thought this book was very well done and loved the author's description of his experiences. As a neurosurgeon, one who knows as much about the brain and its functions as anyone, his conclusions and the reasons for them are very interesting. Dr Alexander spends a lot of time presenting his scientific position as well as his personal belief system before his NDE (Near Death Experience) and how his life and beliefs have changed dramatically since then. His journey was beautifully described and the ending presented more proof about his visit to a world beyond what he was able to see here on Earth. I have read other books on NDE and appreciate this book for not getting deep into a religious interpretation. I also appreciate the doctor saying that everyone's experience will be different.  If you send ten people to Paris - you will get ten different stories and experiences but it doesn't mean any of them are wrong. I love it when science can open up to meta-physics - meaning other than physics, for there is much more &#34;out there&#34; than can be explained or proven in a lab. I do recommend this book to anyone looking for hope of life after death or someone wanting to compare their own experiences. As a person who didn't have to be convinced - I enjoy reading about this man's journey. It got a little too scientific during part of the book - but I understand the author's reason for qualifying his position.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I was addicted to angry birds way before this but Star wars version is so amazing.  The light saber, force, and laser guns make it even more fun.  It is kicking my butt on some levels to get 3 stars but so much fun.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|Graphics pull you in very cool. Bummed my first round of free play didn't save. Had to start over to get a long way back into the game and to the stopping point of where you have to pay. Puzzles are great well hidden objects. I would recommend this one. Five bucks is steep for the full game. 4 stars because of that. I'll likely end up buying though.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|i was on my last 2 or 3 notes slender man was in front of me i ran and i check to see if i lost him i turned around and he was in front of me what the heack! i almost beat the game
B001NKI60W|5.0|This movie is a perfect combination of light humor, musical, and a little cheesiness.  The cast does a stellar job of singing the fabulous hits of ABBA, one of my favorite groups ever.  I know that some people don't respect the poppy sensation that was ABBA, but their songs range in style and sound, and let's not forget that they are the second most sucessful band behind only the Beatles.  Everybody can't be wrong!  Watch it and see for yourself.  Plus, it's set in Greece, one of the most beautiful places in the world!
0393089134|4.0|I have to admit that I've been a longtime fan of the Kubrick movie but I had never read the book. I decided to change that as one of my 2013 New Year's Resolutions. I have to admit that I'm very glad I did. The book definitely grabs your attention and makes it hard to think about other things until you're finished it. Not that you don't continue thinking about it after you're done, but it's like an obsession while you're still in the middle of it. Well at least it was for me. Your mileage may vary, but I was hooked. My only complaint about the book is a trivial one that has nothing to do with the author or the story. This has to be the ugliest cover of any book that I own, and I own hundreds of books. Art is very subjective, but I hated looking at the front cover when I put the book down. It bothered me so much that I didn't want to look at it. I don't mean any disrespect to the artist or publisher, but I just thought I'd mention it because had I not already been a longtime fan of the movie, I would never have bought a book with that cover, not that I would be judging the inside based on the cover, but that I would not want something like that in my house where I'd have to look at it. In the end I wound up putting a brown paper grocery store bag cover over it like it was a school textbook, and it solved the problem for me. Anyway as I said, this complaint is trivial as it has nothing to do with the quality of the story, and that is what is important. Besides that, I'm sure there are people who like the cover. Art is subjective, and my little opinion is subjective too. Anyway it's a great book.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I always enjoy John Grisham & this book didn't disappoint. The Racketeer has orchestrated an elaborate scheme that started after a  federal court judge was murdered which led to imprisoning an innocent man and ended with twist. A good read.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Love the story line hate the ending. It's sad even though Clayton kinda deserved it, it was still sad. But I'm happy that Elizabeth and Logan got to be together and Ben got Zeus. Good things come to good people.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We love this game. My son introduced me to this and now I am hooked. I love playing with different characters. We now challange other family members to see who has the high score. All my family has this app. and I would recommend this one to all.

B00AGOGOLE|3.0|It's simple and I like I wish there would be more features for the pictures though. But I recommand it to anyone who likes simple things!
B00177Y9ZC|1.0|I read the book first and was seriously disappointed that they had to make the bad guys \\"religious bigots\\" vs the terrorist bad guys to start and then the people 'in power' who wanted to use / exploit his ability. I thought the book was great, as were the following novels, and look forward to the movie moguls following the book, instead of hijacking the script.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this app! It's so much fun and great to play with friends! All around Amazing, If you enjoy temple run you will like this even more!

B005OK722U|1.0|When did horror movies become movies where people just get tortured slowly?  When did seeing people get tortured slowly become entertainment?  Why is it okay for a movie like this to be made?<br /><br />This is a movie made by psychopaths - I mean that literally.  The people responsible for making this movie are losers, people who contribute nothing to society except to make this world a worse place to live.  I find it disgusting that movies like this exist, and that there are people entertained by movies like this.  This isn't meant to be a joke or to be facetious - if you like this movie, do the world a favor and kill yourself.  I am absolutely not kidding about that.  This is a movie made by psychopaths - for psychopaths, and if you like this movie - there's no room in the world for loser scum like you.
B009O2XY12|1.0|I agree with one of the other reviews.  The game was fine and a good distraction.....  until you ran out of bubbles.  Then here comes the hook to buy .. YES BUY... more.  What a cheap trick.  I have removed this game from my device and will be suspect of anything from &#34;TeamLava.&#34;
B007SGM084|5.0|i loved these books because of the story line of them. i have to say nothing about the book was bad. i would recamend it for anyone who likes to read to read it. its that good.

B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have downloaded and uninstalled countless games. This my friends is by far the most well thought out, designed and created game I've played! It was well worth the 5$ price tag. The music and graphics included in this game are amazing, the puzzles have the perfect amount of hardness, logical thinking and enjoyable failures. I cannot say one bad thing about this game other than &quot;why'd it have to end&quot;! Too only took me 3 days tops to complete, but there is still tons to do. Thanks 2D boys for creating an amazing game that work beautifully on my kindle fire HD! I hope there is an upgrade/ New game coming soon. I Am most definitely a loyal 2D boys fan! All in all this game is a MUST HAVE/BUY!. Thanks again.

0670023329|5.0|North Korea is a very dangerous and scary country.  This book is an amazing tale of how one man defied the odds and escaped from a North Korean concentration camp and somehow made it to China and then to South Korea.  The average North Korean has shrunk in size by three inches due to the starvation policies of the regime.  Worse, the regime consigns certain families to inter generational hell - the so-called &#34;Three Generation&#34; policy - in terms of keeping generation after generation of &#34;trouble makers&#34; in these Aushwitz-like camps.  When will the world liberate these poor people trapped in these camps????
141659521X|3.0|Have read every one of Flynn's prior books, and this one just doesn't match up. Very poorly edited. Don't these books have a human being actually doing the proof reading anymore, or do they just spellcheck it and call it good?
0061339202|5.0|No matter what situation we're in, whether it's a vacation in the Bahamas or a long prison sentence, we decide whether we're going to be happy of miserable by what we allow into our consciousness. Contrary to what we would like to believe, it's not our external environment that determines our quality of life, but our internal environment.<br /><br />Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has spent decades researching and developing a theory of happiness called \\"Flow\\". \\"Flow\\" is \\"optimal experience.\\" It is total mental immersion into a creative or playful activity. It's that state of mind when you are so involved in what you are doing that you don't even notice the passing of time. Csikszentmihalyi says that when we are able to experience flow in our every day lives, we'll know true happiness.<br /><br />\\"When experience is intrinsically rewarding, life is justified in the present, instead of being held hostage to a hypothetical future gain...Lost in Antarctica or confined to a prison cell, some individuals succeed in transforming their harrowing conditions into a manageable and even enjoyable struggle, whereas most others would succumb to the ordeal.\\"<br /><br />My own experience is proof of this. I've been in prison for the last twelve years. I experience flow when I play music. What I experience when I'm playing is the same thing whether I was in prison or free. The only thing that exists in my mind is my fingers on the strings and the notes in my ear, not prison guards, bars or fences.<br /><br />When I go for a twenty mile run, I experience the same thoughts and feelings as I would running free. In my consciousness, it's the same, as it is also with reading a book. I could try to escape the prison experience with drugs, TV, overeating or whatever, but I would be sacrificing the happiness I can have in the present.<br /><br />This gives new meaning to the recovery slogan \\"One day at a time.\\" The past and the future only exist in our minds, in our consciousness. As Bertrand Russell said, \\"Even though time be real, to realize the unimportance of time is the gate to wisdom.\\" Flow allows me to be content and free no matter where I may be or what situation I may be in.<br /><br />Review Written by David Allan Reeves<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"Bertrand Russell said, \\"Even though time be real, to realize the unimportance of time is the gate to wisdom.\\" Flow allows me to be content and free no matter where I may be or what situation I may be in.<br /><br />Review Written by David Allan Reeves<br />Author of \\"Running Away From Me\\"
B003UBTX72|5.0|Good  book to read.  An interesting and anjoyable read for those of you that follow Rock and Roll.  Very interesting.
B006T5C5PS|4.0|\\"The Gerson Therapy\\" is a program that is difficult to follow but may give some hope for recovery from cancer. After reading this book I was impressed by all the work that must have gone into creating this program.<br /><br />Basically this program requires you to drink fruit and vegetable juices thirteen times a day and to also take numerous supplements. With that said I think you should be under the care of a doctor from the Gerson clinics because trying to figure out how to take the supplements and in what quantities is very difficult to figure out.<br /><br />Also to follow this program you need to basically become a vegan for a while and then you can slowly add back in animal protein in limited quantities if your doctor permits it. There are many limitations and basically you will just be eating fruits and vegetables as well as rye bread, oatmeal and brown rice. No salt is allowed and dairy is restricted at first. No animal protein is allowed at first. No sugar, no pasta, no flour, no sprouts, no soy products, no cucumbers, no coffee or tea (besides chamomile and peppermint), no fats besides flaxseed oil and no candy, cakes or muffins and pastries. As you can see this diet is mostly vegan.<br /><br />There are a lot of complex things to figure out when following this program. For example a regular centrifugal juicer is apparently not good enough. The juicer you need is much more expensive and I could not even find it at amazon. The book gives the address of the manufacturer and explains where to order it. Basically the author of this book claims that if you don't have the right juicer you are just wasting your time and you won't get well.<br /><br />My impression after reading this book was that you need a lot of money to get well. It may also be advisable to go to the Gerson clinic in Tijuana Mexico to figure out how to take care of yourself. That will cost thousands per week. Then at home you must take various supplements, do coffee enemas and use about 15-20 pounds of produce a day. This will take an extra refrigerator - to keep everything fresh.<br /><br />Now the stories of people's experiences with this program are amazing. The pictures of the well patients do look very promising. However these are people who went to the clinic, learned a lot about their care and kept on a strict diet after leaving the clinic.<br /><br />In this book the author does explain that the Gerson program is difficult to follow. I would have to agree with that. Some people have had to ask for the help of their family to keep on track.<br /><br />If you are going to buy this book I'd suggest getting the paperback. Only because there are recipes and it would be easier to cook from a paperback version. My only complaint about the recipes is that they seem to be vague in regards to oven temperatures. Low heat to one person might not be low enough to another.<br /><br />I would think of this book as an introduction to the topic of getting well if you have cancer. Realistically you will have to do much more research and also possibly go to the clinic to get supplies and advice.<br /><br />The last thing I would like to say is that you should be cautious about who you tell about this book. I have found all my interactions with people I talked to to be very negative and sometimes aggressive. I thought people would be happy to hear that there might be hope for terminally ill cancer patients. I was wrong!<br /><br />With that said I take no responsibility for your health should you follow this program.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Perfect ending. Love the character Mr. Grey.  Very romantic sensual story. I would definitely buy this books again.  I consider the fifty shades trilogy to be fascinating.
B000002MNR|4.0|I'm a little biased since I think Mark Knopfler may be THE VERY BEST. This is a nice CD that gives you 18 tracks from 4 different movie soundtracks performed by him. Everyone knows him from the Dire Straits and most know of his very successful solo career. Some folks may be unaware of his success at writing and performing soundtracks for a number of movies, or that this represents some of the best of his work. He has a tendency to score the music for some very fine movies that have more cult -like following than big box-office success. As such, some of that work may get overlooked. The movies represented here are Cal, the Princess Bride, Last Exit to Brooklyn and Local Hero. Whether you are just beginning to explore his work or are a serious fan you'll love this CD. Lyrical, sometimes haunting music turning into lively and happy tunes. I don't think anyone else does it nearly as well.
B003QS9WIE|3.0|Kind of a fake Memento. I like the movie, don't get me wrong, but Nolan has done better and this one was just so &#34;inside&#34; that i couldn't get it all together in my mind afterwards.
B0049VZ222|5.0|So far I've only watched the first episode. This show has an interesting story and great makeup! Truely scary and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book is amazing. It lived up to my expectations, in fact, it surpassed them. I've been a fan of this series for a long time, and I love this book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I really love it I can look at my fb and talk to people because its just like the one on computer so get it now what have you got to lose!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A beautiful and moving book.  Never underestimate the power of words.  They can bring good or evil.  Let us all use our words for good.
1476719071|5.0|If I could think of another word for \\"Amazing\\" right now I would use it. But as I'm still suffering from a tremendous \\"book hangover\\" from this story I can't. This book is an incredible read from the first page to the last. I literally sat with it on my lap when I finished it and just sat there.. trying to take it all in.. while trying to figure out how was going to get on with the rest of my day. It's that good! Cannot wait for April 2013 too dive into the second book. But don't take my word for it.. read it and see! Once you read the story of Travis and Abby you will not forget it.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I really liked all of the songs on here - there was one I wasn't crazy about, but liking all but one is pretty good I think.  I sent one to my brother-in-law and his wife and they also loved it.  I also gave one to each of my kids - don't know what they thought of it yet.
0142420891|2.0|this sequel to the original book was a real let down. it basicly rehashed what happened in the firt book. This book is written by her boyfriend post tragic accident. Found the book to be pretty lame.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|keeps me up to date with family and friends also play some of the games that they have to offer
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Purchased this for my 51 year old brother for Christmas and he just raved about it. He also received a surround sound bar whic really enhanced the music. Anyone who loves Zeplin should have this in their collection.
B001EBWING|5.0|This is a great classic we have watched dozens of times and we will continue to watch it. Great love story and great lines.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I'm one of those people that go crazy when I hear a song and cant remember who sang it this is my savior it is super Fast and Easy. Gives you the Singer, Album and will even connect you to itunes to purchase it!
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Nice pack for any DSLR. Pockets for cords/ charger/notebooks, and room for lenses and body with lens attached as well as manuals.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|If you are looking for items this app will work great for you. I am a seller and it doesn't make it very user friendly.
B004TI5N38|4.0|As usual David Baldacci kept my interest throughout.  This was well written.  I have always like to ready his books.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Can't do everything but it helps you view the current items. Can't pull up all apps within facebook and newsfeed doesn't allow you to go back very far.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I've just started reading Vince Flynn books and I really enjoy his works.  He has kept up the intrigue as I have grown to expect.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I liked the movie, but I was disappointed that the movie was not delivered to me in HD. The picture on my HDTV was grainy, much like TV of old. If my next movie from Amazon comes is the same quality, Amazon will lose this part of my business.
B0019N95IK|4.0|grr. I am sad to see they will be releasing these one at a time and not as a box set. I'm sure they will release them as a set eventually, but there is a risk they won't if the seasons don't sell well, which I've never understood, because why would you buy both!? I didn't want to watch the series when it aired , being an original series only fan - but watching it later on dvd (that I borrowed from a friend) I fell in love with the series. I have had the dvd box set on my wish list for awhile, but it was too pricey for me. It doesn't look like the blu ray set will be any more affordable with the first season being over $80. :( sad face.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not a particularly well written book, above average but not the best. what is the best is, is the grip the storyline has on you. There's heartbreak, warm and fuzzy, and incompleteness, and the combination leaves you feeling something bigger.that something that you want from every piece of art.<br />Beautiful story, well constructed and something that will leave memories brewing around this in your head for years.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Its been a while since I read any Stephen King.  This book was better than many of his prior novels.  I like the inclusion of factual incidents and names to add to the realism.  Good stuff.  I was just a youngster when Kennedy was killed and it has always been interesting to me, so this topic hit home.
0393340244|4.0|Delusions of Gender had been on my to-read list for a very long time, so I was more than happy to pick up a copy from my library. I really like how Cordelia writes in a way that is simple and easy to understand for the reader who might not be a neuroscientist. She writes with so much intelligence and isn't afraid to add humor in her discussion. I also like how she sprinkles a bit of sarcasm here and there. I find it extremely amazing that she was able to read The Female Brain by Louann Brizendine, which I attempted to read before but found to be extremely sexist and guilty of false claims.<br /><br />Of course, knowledge is power, but like the saying goes, the truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off. There are some parts in this book that made me pretty mad. Reading about women's experiences at work with sexual harassment and discrimination in the science and math fields is so infuriating and it's something I will never get used to. The fact that they are supposed to shut up about it or else they are seen as overly sensitive is just pure BS.<br /><br />The only thing that I'm disappointed about is the fact that she doesn't really talk about transgender women and transgender men. Sexism is definitely detrimental to the transgender community because it reinforced traditional gender roles, a topic that she spoke about extensively throughout the book. There is a mention of a transgender woman in the book, but it's a brief reference. I would have loved to see her discussion about how gender variant and transgender youth are affected by their environment and the media. But perhaps I will find that in another book.<br /><br />I really like how she tackles neurosexism and the gender binary by using hard science and a realistic, critical eye on information that is seen as golden and valid.
B007WPLZAK|5.0|Captivating from beginning to end.  I was so glad this was the equivalent of two movies so I can relish every moment.  Eddie is a fabulous actor.
B0015AARJI|5.0|estraordinario equiupo vale la pena gastar dolar a dolar un regalo maravilloso. toda una joya bjcjldf sbj, mbmsbjds  dshdshds hnmsdvbhd
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Never read the book but fell in love with movie.  Should have won an academy award in my opinoin.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|Wasn't sure if I'd like this show, but after the first episode or two I wound-up watching all of this season so-far.
0451232852|4.0|Excellant Read<br />Can't wait to read the sequel. I had loved his other triolgys such as Pillars of the Earth and World without End.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I am a bit of a snob when it comes to the SF I read...  but I have to say that this is a great book!!  I mean REALLY good in so many ways....  give me more of Andy Weir!!
B0068MNO4S|4.0|I know it did not do good in the theaters but I absolutley loved this.  A very different take on Shakespeare.  If you love historical dramas you will love this.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Do not pass up the chance to read all 3 books.  Love this series. Very well written. Wish there were more!
B0083P1QUM|2.0|It wasn't that interesting. Jumped around too much.Story was disconected and hard to follow. I didnot care for the book.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Great for posting information, greetings, creating events, keeping in touch with family and friends, connecting to other news/social media, or playing games, etc. However one needs to keep in mind FB, although it makes you feel you can customize your privacy, it is an open portal for your info and that of your family/friends to be gathered by third parties out there in the Internet world through their legal policy loopholes.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Ok so I'm not a novice when it comes to software, testing, or bugs.  But Amazon has bitten off more then they can chew this time.  I have a brand new Nokia Lumia 920.  I use Amazon, so I figured this app would be a no brainer.  Downloaded it and it worked.  Get notified there is an update, so I download that.  Result is there is now a non functioning app on my phone that I can not delete, and can not use.  After contacting Nokia, there suggestion is to hard reset the device.  Well I have a second suggestion, Amazon sort out your coding, it is awful.  So I can't give Amazon any more money till they sort out this problem... #lostacustomer
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Good for business, social and entertainment info that gives out bursts of info and opinions.You always have access to  the voices and information pertaining to your interests. You don't have to tweet. You can listen in or read  other tweets  or get information at that moment. You can follow others or have others follow your tweets-can customize for privacy. Can be used  as other social media on cell phones, computers, etc
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Good book for my first e book.  Quick read.  Never read this author before but it was a good read.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Every family should have a copy of this movie.....<br />this is something you don't see on a daily basis......The attention, love, well documented.......
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The best Jessica Lange is the best actress ever last season and this season.the only reason to watch true horror
B0065GC0BA|4.0|A book needs to have some real magic to earn a Four Star rating from me and this book has it. The author was very courageous to take on the subject matter and did a really fantastic job of it. It was well paced and entertaining, moving but at the same time so cleverly constructed that it wasn't at all maudlin. This is the first Jojo Moyes book I have read and I loved her writing style which I became immersed in straight away - thoughtfully constructed, complex, believable characters and dialogue. I inhaled this book.
B00445RHKI|4.0|I'm test-flying a new electronic product. I see something, I like it, I buy it. I write reviews only if I DON'T like it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I'm a Vince Flynn/Mitch Rapp fan so am somewhat predudiced.  Have read just about everything written by Flynn about Rapp.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this book is fantastic. It grips you and you find yourself laughing with the characters and crying with them. I would LOVE a sequel to this book to follow up on the characters as they face healing and college!!
B008AIGWVA|3.0|I don't see the fun in it after realizing what it does, but the under 6 year old kids love it.  It is much like the Talking cat app that came before (from the same developers).  The kids like it as it mimics, and does cutesy things...but it takes up a great deal of space for a phone app.  Not an issue with a tablet, but some with a smaller capacity phone might hesitate.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|it is hard to write enough words when one word, Awesome is all that is needed to describe this item.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Just what I needed to make my Kindle the perfect companion.  Protective and practical.  Maybe the best part is how the magnets turn it on automatically when you open it (turning on the Kindle with the hidden tiny side buttons is actually kind of frustrating and slow, now it just pops on instantly).  Love the way the cover is secure but can be popped on and off easily.  Love the adjustable stand feature.  Highly recommended.  No reason to buy something more elaborate or expensive.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The beginning was boring. It started off really slow for the first couple of chapter. About half way it picked up and got interested.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Enjoyed this music very much. I was able to see the characters in my mind as I listened to the music.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was probably my favorite book of the series. The whole book was interesting and kept me on my feet. Loved it!
B004J00KJ8|3.0|This DVD is a bad transfer of the movie, My vhs tape was sharper. Spend the extra and get the bluray
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I immediately became hooked after the first couple of chapters. The whole book was quite interesting and I would absolutely recommend.
0765325950|1.0|I only read on my Kindle these days. No e-book means to me it is not published. I cannot understand what reason would make sense to not make it available on e-book. I guess most people will now just get it illegally, what a shame.
B00125JP1C|4.0|I will start by saying that the beginning of this film is beyond crazy. Would love to see the mythbusters prove that you can shoot out a car's oil pan and then slide through it like that. Clive Owen is one of my very favorite actors and had fun watching this high speed action flick.
B0053O89IS|5.0|We are collecting the series of Bones and found this to be one of the best seasons. We enjoy watching.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|For those of us wishing there were more of 50 Shades...this book gives it to us. Finally in this second book we find out more about Gideon! I still think if there were a real Christian Grey and real Gideon Cross, Christian would be hotter looking, but this is a great book.
B003L77G8I|5.0|We are continuing to purchase the entire series of one of our favorite shows.  It has not been a disappointment.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Lots of different puzzles and more choices  and easy to use..  Check it out right now for lots of .continual fun.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|when i finished this book, i definitely spent about ten seconds considering starting it over again immediately. well-written, engaging story.
B000UZ6ZI6|5.0|My father use to have this record when I was a kid.  I love the fact that I own a record that reminds me alot of him.  On top of that, the record is fantastic, in my humble opinion
B008OOYALE|2.0|This game is really cute, but what you can do without paying is very limited. I honestly wouldn't mind paying a reasonable fee, but it can cost $6 to feed your dragon one time.
7040243148|5.0|I've seen this movie soooo many times.  I've bought this wonderful dvd sooo many times.  If you don't own it, you need to have it just because of the actors on the dvd.  I must admit that hearing Jane Fonda speaking french is kinda weird.  In fact, it's also my least favorite story on the film.  \\"William Wilson\\" w/Alain Delon & Bridgette Bardo is probably my favorite one besides Felini w/Terrance Stamp(love Felini).  Classic!!!!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It was a good story.  I liked the way he builds the readers's knowledge about zoo animals so the open ended plight of the tiger is up to their conclusion.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|I loved the Christmas themed characters in this set, this year Darth Maul was Santa! There are many ships and several minifigs included! Great for kids I'm sure, but, this big kid really enjoyed it too!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The following 2 books were equally as addictive.  Brilliant storyline, nicely written.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read.
B005IQZB14|5.0|The author's openness and honesty couldn't help but engage me, and I loved her storytelling. I didn't immediately forget it when I finished, her story sparked my own reflection on my life, and new choices and actions have been taken. For me, that's a powerful book!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Very good at my age for my hand and eye coordination. Enjoyable pastime.for anyone of any age. Only had it for 2 weeks and I alternate it with freecell.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Its one of the best series out there.  What else could possibly be said to fill this review box up.
B007WFR1MQ|5.0|MY HUSBAND LOVED THIS CD AND IT ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY WHICH I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH !!!<br />IF YOU LIKE THIS BAND I RECOMMEND IT
B003L77G6A|5.0|Its one of the best series out there.  What else could possibly be said to fill this review box up.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Enjoyed the game and looking for more. Chalanging puzzles great story line. You can become addicted to the hint button. I have not played that many games like this one but have not played one with such a complete hint button. I recommend it.
B007V5CF5K|2.0|i got about a 1/4 way into the game. I need a piece of a record to go on and the game will not let me pick up the piece. so i cannot go any further in the game. i don't know how to get help with these kindle fire games
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This is a great movie in a line of great movies.  I wished he lived longer and was able to make more books and then they could be made into more movies.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|my granddaugher enjoyed this till she ran out of peanuts. then found out you have to buy peanuts wiht real money. not good
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Originally bought a different cover from a chain store and hated it. I returned it and ordered this one from Amazon...I received it in two days and absolutely love it. It is designed just perfectly for my Kindle Fire.  It is simple to use and serves as good protection also.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|watched this with my grandkids one is 19 and one is 13. we all enjoyed it. great music. would recomend
B003ZSJ212|5.0|how could this be anything but the best?  not possible. it's the ultimate must have for any star wars fan,
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This has become my granddaughters favorit movie. She can almost recite it word for word. My daughter loved Bell and the Beast, one of her favorite movies.
1451695195|5.0|This well-written book is a quick read that goes beyond the run-of-the-mill explanations of near death encounters (NDE) with a first-hand medical explanation of the encounter coupled with the plausible notion that the NDE is in fact very real beyond the often explained &#34;remnants of a dying (but still active) mind.&#34; If you're the least bit intrigued at what lies beyond the precipice of the afterlife, add this book to your list of must-reads.
B006OKOZGU|5.0|The only reason I removed this delightful comedic /drama /thriller,  is that I do not own a Blu - Ray player! This is one of my most favorite Cary Grant movies.  Alas, I'll just need to search for the DVD! If you're looking to see what Cary Grant movies are all about, one movie won't begin to show the wide variety of this actor, but you will love this one!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|At least I know how to play this game and can enjoy it.  Am still learning its little quirks. It is adequate.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was better than the first. Can't wait to read the third book. Hope there more excitement to come.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|It is a basic camera.  The quality is so-so. You have to point it at the thing.  I would not use it for any really important shots.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|wonderful show...entertaining same time educational...superb characters and acting  absolutely a thrill  a sho to watch and rnjoy over and over
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My son loved the variety of figures.  It was so much fun to open each compartment and day!  we will buy the advent calendar for next year too .
B00866H7SS|5.0|Stunning love story, well worth the read! Better than 50 shades trilogy.... Loved the characters as they were real..now onto the next book and there are 3 in this series
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I love this book and discovered a new writer (for me), after finishing this book I immediately ordered 'Independence Day'.  It's real old-fashioned story telling, so well written and such a good story.<br />You never know where the writer will take you, full of suspense.  And  the characters are not quite what they seem.  And yet you understand why they acted as they did.<br />Wonderful book.<br />Regards Samantha Robinson.<br />p.s. would it be possible for you to address me as above, my husband Peter Out does not own a kindle and never orders books!
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|amazing. pure gold. that is all. this album tells a story not only through lyrics, but through instrumentals also. its not like coheed and cambria where the story is complex. youd think in the end was the best song on the album, but nope. every song had me. great way to mix orchestrated music with their hard rock style. i would definitely suggest getting this album. its worth the buy
B004S49Z3W|4.0|Romantic Comedy that ends with everything sorted out and people will just go about being happy? Well I always have a hard time accepting that idea when a character is as over the top and flakey as Bridget.<br /><br />But Helen Fielding is just so good at the confused, over-thinking character going about the day to day of their life. It helps of course that this plot is mostly lifted from Jan Austen's Pride and Prejudice.
020530902X|5.0|I gave this as a gift to a young women just entering community college, because I used it extensively myself over two decades ago. It is a fundamental book to have when writing any class paper.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Bourne Legacy, an  action adventure, provided the action and conspiracy found in the past Hour e movies. However, it had a singular purpose of setting up another movie to come. I am no critic and enjoyed the movie for its action and intrigue.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|Paranorman takes stopmotion to a new level. It has set the bar for future stopmotion work. Along with incredible animation the story deals with a much darker theme than other animated films of this nature.
B009HELT3C|4.0|MIB3 surprised me in a new turn of events. I was expecting the same comedic alien adventure. The personal twist was delightfully moving.  This movie made a fun evening.
0823023494|5.0|There are thousands of drawing books on the market, I have many myself, but this book is unique to what it focuses on. Most books will cover character  personality but this is the first one to devote an entire book solely on that idea. The artist is a Disney veteran and has incredible talent. You can't be a serious cartoonist without having this in your reference library.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Love it.  It is a fun and very useful tool for keeping in touch with my grown children and grandchildren.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|A great book for young and advanced readers. I really enjoyed it. One of the best books I have ever read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This really head my attention. I always wondered what was going to happen next. A good page turner. Very good.
B0094MAZKK|5.0|Loved this foreign action flick. Great fight sequences and good story line. I was on edge almost the entire time. Hubby loved it and watched it more than once.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|The only thing this app needs is the ability to go backwards (rewind) a song to better learn it. I have learned several songs from this app now. The app can play or stop the song or let you play it. it would be nice to have a rewind feature to help one learn the songs faster and focus on one part. Still a 5 star app.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I could not put this book down. I believe that is the first time I've ever written that last sentence in my entire life!
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|played the carnival game for $2.99, the price is to high for this simple game and it has the same game lay out as the last one .
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Anyone who likes historical fiction, will like this book.  I am looking forward to reading the next two in this series!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I didn't think I would like it as I'm not a big fan of zombie movies. But the zombies are almost the backnote here. GREAT series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You can play for a short time or hours. This is an addicting and fun little app to have on your device.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|Very insightful book.  This book reveals a lot about President Obama's world view, how he came to these and why he wants to make changes in the US.  I respect this understanding of self and the world around us, it is deeply thoughtful and helps us to fully understand the work he is doing.  Great read.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Game is interesting but easy enough for a young school age child to figure out. If you want the play to be more difficult, try getting the stars in various amounts and then gaining the crown on each level.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I really like this book, very interesting stories with an obvious historical research background for the situations and people being written about.  There is nothing that I dislike about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work at all, as a result there is nothing to dislike about the stories I have so far read, which have been only the first 3.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Easy to follow and find items as needed. No glitching.  Long game play and not too frustrating to figure out. A+
B004EBT5CU|5.0|My daughter loves this CD and I got it for her for Christmas and she was excited. She listens to it all the time
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to navigate program is awesome. I love going in to check various places and what their weather is like. It has everything I want in a weather app.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Hard to put it down, it had me wanting to read more. Romance is definitely in the air here.  A must read!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like playing the game. It is challenging to find some of the things but there are a ton of objectives and there are a lot of rooms that you need special coins to search in them. I play the lower levels and typically leave searching in the upper ones alone due to cost.
B008AX1HD8|1.0|A kindle book consists of some few Megabytes, put together by Kindle on a screen. And these few Megabytes cost for this book 22 dollars. 22 dollars for an ebook for my opinion is ridiculous.Despite that I gave it a go and bought it. 22 dollars is definitely not worth the book. Some reviews said, Nesbo is the next Larsson, that if you think of it again, you can only smile.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy doing the puzzles but the pieces are so small it's hard to tell what piece i need to use until I pull it onto the playing field. It would be nice if the pieces were larger in the waiting area so I can actually see what I am dragging onto the board.
B005TKD6NY|5.0|This book is a bit mindset changing. Is not a guide-to-happiness. Not at all. Just a case study through an indirect guide on what not to do, so you could be eventually happy. So, what would Toru do?<br />Characters drawn with superb texture make this book unique. Feelings and emotions, people and part of our lifes locked, and released by just listening to a tune blasted from the past. Norwegian Wood.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It almost completely eliminates the difficulty accessing the &#34;like&#34; button that happens when you go in via the net. keeps things clear and easy to view as well.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Claire Danes is a terrific actress!! I got my sister hooked on Homeland and  she stayed up watching back to back episodes until 8 O'clock in the morning. It's a must see!
B005HSL626|4.0|This isn't really a game I would use for long term. It was fun for a while, but got boring. It also glitched a lot on my Kindle.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|great movie from beginning to end. i saw this movie a few time already but wanted to rewatch it again because it good.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I deleted it because it did not have the weather for my city. It was also a little difficult to navigate.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is a distinct view of what Psychiatrists face every day through their patients agony. It is a clear picture capturing the result of childhood sexual abuse coupled with a peek at the all-to-frequent result of alcoholism. Except for the unnecessary vulgar words, Collleen Hoover is a top-notch writer! I suspect she may have known this subject well through experience rather than from research.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|After not giving a great review with the last game I purchased from G5;  I am happy to see this game come out.  Another great HO/adventure game.  These are the games I continue to look forward to.  Keep them coming!  Thank you G5.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I loved the animation of the bear. The story is different and the movie has its moments but I thought it was unnecessarily vulgar. I cal it high school humor. The plot was so so.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I gave it to my 9 year old grandson and he loved it.  In fact, the entire family did!  Good buy!
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Loved this book great parable that is still very relevant in todays society.  Should be a must read in all schools.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book so I can't wait until I read the next one<br /><br />I love this book.<br /><br />What I don't like about this book is that it kinda upsets my stomach but I get through it.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next one in the series!!!!!!!!! :)
075669812X|5.0|My son loves this book, He is 7 soon to be 8. anything you want to learn about the characters is in this book

B00003CXIP|4.0|This was a great coming of age story similar to Goonies (With One Actor From That Movie), but much more realistic in its content. Some humor, but mostly a serious and sad drama of 12-year-old kids coming of age in 1950s America. How things have changed!<br /><br />Buy this DVD and you will be impressed by the extras included on the disc. How all of the kids have changed in the intervening years. It's too bad about River Phoenix. He would have been a phenom had he lived.<br /><br />All young men will be able to identify with htis movie- boys too.<br /><br />A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
B0084BMUFA|2.0|I think that the book is boring for the most part but it is a really old book so I understand why I hated it.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Its the greatest season yet!!! Every episode is a guaranteed laugh!no matter how many times you watch it he will keep laughing! :-)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is great! But can you please make snapchat!!!! Please! Please please please please please please please please I've been trying to download it forever and this store doesn't have it! Please!!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Completely absorbed my life for 2 days. One of the best books ive ever read! Would recommed it to everyone.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I found this book a little slow to start but once it got going it really a book I didn't want to put down. I would call this book full of imagimation and delight.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I'm not really sure what the point of the movie was.  I kept waiting for the movie to get better and then it ended. Absolutely awful.
B0015DROBO|5.0|this book will take you places in your mind that you have never been before. I am a big fan of misteries and this series must be really good. If the next two are as good as this then be prepared to be amazed by this trio of books!
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|Starts slow and way too many characters are introduced. Second half gets much better and is more in keeping with the style of the first two page turning books
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Extremely well written.  Factual, detailed.  A great read for history lovers.  Team of rivals is top  notch reading.  Another great book by Doris Kearns Goodwin.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game.It is very addicting.Once I started playing I couldn't stop.You can lose yourself very easily. Get it now !
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW! What a great story line. I wasn't sure where the story was going.  My first thought was Holder and Sky were related somehow. Well written!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Awesome game but needs more levels and swearing I recommend this game to everyone.Its definitely worth the $6.99<br /><br />Need to buy this s game
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This book is funny. My fifth grader has enjoyed this book and we recommend it. It is a little expensive but worth the read.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Definitely not worth the money.<br />The author has an interesting perspective on why over consumption of wheat products, especially 'white' wheat products is bad for your health but in the long run it's just another diet book that tells you the only way to be healthy is to eliminate multiple foods from  what you eat.
B004WO57E4|5.0|been playing HOMM1 w windows7 on my laptop - nice memories of 17 years ago. Highly recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys turnbased strategy games.
B00AKS656U|5.0|Entertainging and challenging!  a great buy and so worth it.  not overly complicated instructions which is always nice.  characters and graphics a blast!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Pretty bleak and a half hour too long. certainly not one to lift your spirits in any way. A Spartacus for the 21st Century?
0988262592|5.0|This book will end up being required reading for anyone aspiring to lead an IT department in companies large and small. Why? Because it perfectly illustrates through the all-too-real story Gene paints of an IT department in such chaos, with such a business-technology disconnect that it's literally killing the business. Gene's characters are so real that I felt like I knew them. In fact, these characters are so well-researched that you'll swear you've worked with Bill and his colleagues before, or maybe you've worked for Steve.<br /><br />Most importantly, this book will teach you valuable lessons on how to be a good leader, implement streamlined technology through DevOps, and give you a perspective you've probably not had before.<br /><br />I'll say again - required reading.
B00284BNKC|3.0|If you bought this hoping to see a sex scene of Jennifer Connelly you will be throughly disappointed.  However, if you bought it to see a really trippy movie that will puzzle your mind forever, this is it.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law.  She absolutely loves the set.  I will buy her more when it is on her Christmas list.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Considering it is free, it's much better than most of the free games.  Not a lot of ads like others, and the game play is good.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Ordered the app for Kindle Fire,i assume it works good as all Adobe products do.We use it on our PC without problem.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Got package on time. It includes both DVD and blu ray which is great in case you don't have a blu ray available.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This movie was the best animated film of the year! no doubt, Wreck-it ralph will be enjoyed by anyone and its hilarious and nostalgic scenes will entertain you. Best hour and a half you can spend anyway!
B00884GR0W|3.0|This was a very difficult type of game or app to understand how to navigate and start creating your world. The instructions seem vague in hindsight to how much you are able to supposidly do. There seemed to be no altering the controls or slowing the view to the pace you need... dizzying.<br />I just didn't understand how to create let alone go anywhere but to look at block landscape that's computer style. IDK how to rate honestly its not my thing obviously and no way could a young kid figure it out.<br />Florida Mom Real Review Kindle Fire<br />Ps. As I post my review it is Jan 11 2013 and there are no current reviews posted from anyone as it is the FAOTD.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Amazing book great description. I love the main character because I can relate to her. Prim is my favorite also because she is my age
B0050DIWFC|3.0|It was a good read but not sure how I feel about the ending. I am still trying to decide if I was disappointed or not.
0307744434|4.0|Beautiful. It is a work of art. I'll admit, the plotting is not particularly compelling. There were a few moments when I was bored, but the book is worthwhile for the setting. As an author ([[ASIN:B00AQL9ZAO Goblin Fruit]]) I find setting to be one of the most challenging aspects of storytelling. Morgenstern's settings are masterful--imaginative, enticing, magical. This is well worth a read.
B0086700CM|4.0|it's temple run what's not to love!!!! at first all my friends had it and I didn't think it was this fun..they. proved me wrong!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Easily the funniest show ever! Only gets better with each season! Can't wait for more! Season eight nine Amway ten anyone?
1609611543|5.0|Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat was as advertised. A very in depth study of the role that wheat has played in Americas obese problem. It is written in laymans language and understandable. All of the statements are backed up by references. The author adds some humor to break up  the dryness of the subject.  He convinced me to start on the diet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I feel in love with this book. It really pulls on all your emotions. I would recommend this to any and all.
B005F3XV62|5.0|This was a great family movie.  Clean, very funny and the kids loved it.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Bought for a Xmas gift.  My daughter loved them.  Good price.  Good movies. The Dark Knight is the best by far.
B00942S4OY|5.0|my daughter plays her new CD constantly, loved the price and love her happiness! Definitely worth the money and time it took to get it!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Once UPON A TIME THERE WAS a new flower that can actually glow there WAS THIS old woman searching for something and she found this flower that can heel HER she sang a song and she got younger BUT the guards came and they saw a flower and they brought it to the QUEEN who was sick so they put the flower in the water and mixed it up THE QUEEN drank it up and she had a new baby and she felt better again the baby had glowing hair everything was perfect but that night that old woman came up to their castle and she cut that baby's hair and that woman became old again the suddenly SHE took the baby than her real parent woke up and saw that old woman took the baby that old woman kept that baby in the tower when that baby grew older that woman told her that it is dangerous out there and I DO NOT WANT YOU TO GO OUT THERE OKAY THAT LITTLE GIRL SAID YES MOMMY I will not go out there 5 years later that little girl became a teenager and she cleaned up the house while her mother go out and get some food
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Its great, it has a good variation of music that goes well with the movie, I cant wait for the movie to come out!

B00633W614|5.0|Archer develops his characters in a way C. Dickinson would admire, the heroes are so rich and complicated, the villains are heinous, but believable.  The writing is flawless as usual.  I'm so looking to the final book in the chronicles.
B001EC2J0C|5.0|This is a marvelous update and restored &#34;Streetcar&#34; and I loved it....especially the booklet that accompanied the Blu-Ray version<br />I love Tennessee!.
0316227706|5.0|Ive seen some of these pictures circulating around the internet, and when I saw this book in the store, I knew I HAD to get it! (From Amazon, of course!)<br />Every picture is fantastic.<br />Our dog loves to swim (he hangs out in the pool when he gets bored), and so this is very close to home.<br /><br />My entire family just about cracks up when we flip through this book. Its one of those books that is made to just leave on the coffee table or counter for when someone is passing by....<br /><br />I would certainly buy it again if needed!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Was interested in reading the original Jack Reacher book after seeing the movie and while I thought it was good it didn't have me turning the pages as much as a lot of the David Baldacci books that I have read. It was still a good read but a little easy to figure out and just didn't keep my attention as other books like this that I had read previously.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was a surprise to me. I didnt expect much of it, but upon downloading and playing, I could NOT stop! Hours later, I had to leave for an appointment.... but I turned it back on as soon as I could!<br /><br />It was over too quickly, though. I wish there were more parts! I would pay for additional stories!<br /><br />It is cross between a seek-and-find game, but you have to solve puzzles, and riddles, and mysteries and secrets! Certainly things are unlocked or accessible only when certain statues are activated (hint hint?). I love it!<br /><br />Certainly a five-star game! Great!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I  really have not spent much time on this yet, but I'm sure I will enjoy it as I am a weather weather.......
0743270754|5.0|Cudos to Doris Kerns Goodwin.  She brought the characters alive and has given me a very deep insight into that period in our history.
B000007XUQ|4.0|The CD arrived in a timely manner. One of the CD's played perfectly in the CD player. Thr other CD did not pay when put into the CD player.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I read a review that called these stories a bit like oceans 11. True. These are great stories of wit and deception. You will immediately like the main character. These are written well too.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|A must see. 3D in my very own living room. Amazing I truly enjoyed it. The colors  and story were spectacular.
1400049628|5.0|Don't waste you time with other survival guides. This one has it all! From supplies lists, to different terrain travel, this book lays it out easily and thoughtfully. Max Brooks has definitely dont the homework here. Even if you aren't into the whole zombe thing, replace the word &#34;zombie&#34; with person who wishes to do you harm and this books is still a necessity. Invest.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is priceless. It is so incredibly versatile, there's no way to describe all it can do in one short paragraph. I kept all my class handouts, lecture slides, and notes in it through grad school, which made it absurdly easy to search and find what I needed to know when studying for tests, or recalling a snippet of information on the spot while at a clinical site. Now that I'm finished with school, I keep copies of all my professional licenses and certifications in a folder for easy access when going through credentialing. Evernote scans images, photos, and documents for any text they contain, so no matter what format you put in, you can find your items easily. It even manages to read handwriting accurately a surprising amount of the time. My immunization records are in another folder, photos of business cards (which I used to always lose) in another. I also take photos of my insurance cards so they're always handy when I need them, summoned easily by a simple search term, rather than lost somewhere in some pocket of my wallet. I've got a shared folder for recipes with my daughter and daughters-in-law, so when they ask for a particular recipe all I have to do is snap a photo of it for them. Since it's all stored online, you can access your information easily no matter where you are, from whatever device you have handy.
0765365278|5.0|Yes, this is a doozy of a book, but well worth the read. I can't wait for the next in the series. Brandon Sanderson is a great story teller.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game rules good graphics and every thing awesome  you really need this game so fuñnnnnnnnnnn  you also need bloons td 4
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Once you read the first one and learn about Vin, you won't be able to stop. The metal twist on these stories is great. Definitely a page turner with great characters. You won't be able to put it down.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Spellbinding read! Due to the brillance of the story telling could easily visualise the drama of the story unfolding. Cant wait to read the sequels.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This story is great. It's written smart with a great story. I recommend this book to any fantasy fiction reader. Don't waste your time with other stories. This is the one that you will compare all other to. Read it now.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Loved this movie, it was so many things in one: Heartwarming & Hilarious, everyone should see this while they can!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I really can't wait for the next one to come out. This is the best series I've ever read. Wonderfully written. Great story. More Please!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This was a MUCH better movie than I thought it'd be! I missed in both in the theaters & on PPV, so purchased it at the recommendation of a friend, was glad I did!

B0063GORYU|3.0|Enjoy the game but not the automatic moving of cards.. More fun to move your own cards. Nice game otherwise.
1402793375|5.0|This is by far my favorite book.  Not only is it the fullest account of the demise of the original peoples.  The book is beautifully laid out.  The Narrative, the photos, the captions are all perfect.  The book is heavy both physically and emotionally.  It is impossible to understand U.S. History without looking at the transformation of this huge land mass from the perspective of the original inhabitants.  Although, their persucution was not perfectly orchestrated by Europeans, they all agreed that white, might was right and for better, but mostly worse, we are where we are today.  This book lays out the step-by-step annihilation of 500 tribes, their languages, and ceremonies, and all the wisdom gathered over thousands of years.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use nice and big!!!  I also love the fact it saves your last total so when balancing your checkbook, it makes it quite nice.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Well done, for a vampire movie it's actually believable.  No extreme scenes of violence or language.  Grand-kids researched Ol'Abe on Google when told he was a real person.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|One of the classic must see Christmas movies. There are several remakes but none compare to the original 1947 movie.
1451695195|5.0|Good story about NDE's and how a non-believer switched his view after he could not explain his experience away with medical methodology.
0307957837|5.0|Bought this book for my girlfriend's birthday. Probably my childhood favourite and I don't actually own it as I keep giving it away for others to read. This is an American version as the first book being called the golden compass not the northern lights. However great quality design.
B0079J28NC|5.0|What's not to love about the Beatles & this super groovy animated movie?  I haven't watched all of the extras yet, as this was a Christmas gift to my boyfriend but was very pleased, so far.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I read this book in high school.  That was 34 years ago.  I wanted to read it again because I remembered loving it in high school
B0076DELIG|4.0|Very enjoyable. Really enjoy all of Connelly's books, but this was very good. Bosch as usual does a great job.
0439023491|5.0|i'm trying to encourage my son to read and he said he read part 1 and would like to read part 2. buying used is the best bargain.  excellent condition and prompt shipping.

B008WCP2PG|1.0|this movie was just absolutely awful; the story line was ok but needed much improvement, the cast were cheesy; regret buying this one!
B000005DQQ|3.0|Just want to say that I love this album to death and there isn't one thing I would change about the album, but the vinyl edition doesn't include the track What Does Your Soul Look Like (Part 4). It's one of my favorites on the album, but other than that the record sounds great, and unfortunately it is not gate-fold packaging.
0545265355|5.0|I got exactly what I ordered on time and in perfect condition. I would recommend this seller to anyone. The books are very nice by the way, nice foil stamp on the hardcover and the box they come in isn't flimsy.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|interesting in some way....explicit in others. good story, good characters, good ending. hope the next book is as good as this one.....
B005NKGEP2|3.0|This book held my interest  till the end. I liked the way she put every thing together at the end.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|There is no reason to buy this book. If you want to get all of this and more, just read his blog. That said, the contents of this &#34;book&#34; are phenomenal. Reading his back story frames appropriately frames not just his rise but what qualities got him there and a few of the mistakes he made along the way. The only reason I rated it 4/5 was because all of this content really is available on his blog. This is the slightly condensed, proof-read version. It's easier to read but there is nothing new here.<br /><br />That said, it's a must-read for any aspiring entrepreneurs.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|This DVD is of great quaility and it arrived before scheduled. This is one of my favorite movies that I had to replace in my collection.
B008ZVXNX2|4.0|I chose this music not only because of the book but for my love of classical music. The songs on here are wonderful, relaxing and in the right setting... exciting. I would recomend it to anyone who loves Classical music.
0743270754|5.0|Abraham Lincoln is a hero of mine for a variety of reasons, he was lawyer, a politician, and an extraordinary President.  How he became those things is told in a well written compelling way.  His strategic and negotiation skills and belief that doing what is right is conveyed so well.  Kearns Goodwin's writing  makes the case Lincoln was not only visionary but stands the test of time.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|A wish-fulfilling fantasy in several respects, but also thought-provoking. That the film closes with shots of India, not Denmark, is important: it suggests that what happens to the children and the community there is equally important.
0800141660|5.0|If you have read the book and even if not this movie is worth a look and a great addition to any collection. Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, and even Hugh Grant do exceptional jobs,the surprise treat is Alan Rickman.  Every time I watch this movie I see nuances in the story that make me appreciate it all the more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Kept me hooked and surprised even when I wrongly assumed it to be predictable.  Best novel I've read in a long time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought it because my son can play it with friends.  It is a challenge to find the gold.  he loves to mine.  Mine craft has seen alot of play time since we got it.
B000FA5STS|4.0|I love David Baldacci book's they are all great reading hope to read more by him very very good book
B008TMA1LY|1.0|Not very user friendly for kids. I had a hard time playing it. Very irritating that you can't click several tasks like most diner games. You have to sit there and wait for Pokey to finish one thing before you can click a new task.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I love the feel and look of this case, but I wish the corners were protected instead of being open. However, the majority of the cases for the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; have open corners. Looks like I'll use this until the Otterbox for it comes out.
0765325950|5.0|I started this series back in 1992, while I was in high school, over 20 years ago.  It's really hard to explain what this series means to me.  All through the years this series has always been there for me - it was the one constant as my life has changed, the one thing that I could always look forward to.  From high school when I would carry the huge paperbacks to every class like a dork and read a few pages any free moment I could get, through college and various jobs and marriage, to today - reading a few pages here and there whenever I can at work and reading late into the night when I should be doing other, more responsible, things.<br /><br />I've gone through the same frustrations as many others over the years, regarding the slowing pace and wondering if Jordan even knew what he was doing, being shocked at his death and fearful of the series' future... so to finally get an end to this series... to get an end that is completely worth the long, agonizing wait, that went above and beyond my expectations... it moved me to tears.<br /><br />This book is incredible.  I've read a lot of fantasy, and this is one of the best fantasy books I've ever read, period.  It is amazing.  It is a completely fitting end to this series.  Whereas some series will have the final climax in a few chapters, The Wheel of Time has a climax of an entire book.  The battles in this book put other famous fantasy battles to shame in terms of scope and emotional impact.  Pelennor Fields?  The Black Gates?  Mere skirmishes compared to this.  The 200 page chapter entitled \\"The Last Battle\\" will blow your mind and put your emotions to the test.<br /><br />I laughed, I cried, I gasped in surprise and shock - no WoT book has moved me like this one.  It was all I hoped for and more.  Many will analyze every word and line and point out inconsistencies and things that \\"Jordan would never do\\" and blah blah blah - forget all that.  It's not going to be perfect so don't waste your time.  Just read it andenjoy the greatest ending to any fantasy currently out there, and know that Sanderson found a way to get it to the ending that Jordan wanted.  If you are someone who has quit the series out of frustration, and don't know whether it's worth finishing - trust me, it is.  It is completely worth the journey.<br /><br />Thank you so much to Brandon Sanderson and everyone involved in completing this series.  It means a lot to me.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I had most of her cds but not this one.I even had the book that has photos in from this cover shoot.This cd is being used for my tiny new grandbaby.May as well get her use to good music!!Celine is my favorite singer EVER!!! And anything by her is TOPS!!! Love love love it!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|when I'm playing this in the morning I usaully don't have time to get is so addicting. I love this so to me its a five star
B005IQZB14|5.0|The girl's got guts.  She's honest.  It's a spiritual, transitional as well as a physical journey.  If you like to read about journeys, especially of the out door type, then you'll like this book.  Even better that's done by a woman- makes for good inspiration for all of us who may be considering our own journey but are just a little too conditioned by all those admonishing voices telling us to be afraid.  We don't have to be!  Or we can walk right thru it and find true courage.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Beautiful. Saw the movie, had to have the soundrack.<br />Clean crisp recording.  Paid $5.  Great deal.<br />I wish it came with video.
1423151054|3.0|The packaging on this set is very nice, with fancy binding and classy printing. But as flipbooks, it leaves a bit to be desired. First of all, the binding of the flipbooks makes it very hard to get the pages to flip down flat and the gloss on the paper makes it hard to see the tiny little lines. A few of the scenes are great, but a lot of them are very subtle actions which are great animation, but don't lend themselves to a flipbook. These are also cleanups, so the lines are very thin and tight. I would have preferred drawings that showed the hand of the animator more, not just the assistants. The most baffling thing about this set though is why they only printed on one side of each page. They could have easily put two scenes in each book. It's worth the price because it's very fancy, but I wish they had made it a little less fancy and made better books for flipping.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I love using my phone for music at the gym and now during cardio I have something to watch too!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Thought I would check out what all the fuss was about and discovered a wonderful series.  It's dramatic and funny and a history lesson all in one.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I really enjoy this time waster.  It's challenging enough to be addictive, but doesn't take a long time to complete.  I wanted to give it 4 1/2 stars only because it does not retain a record of your times when you beat the cube.  It only remembers your fastest time.  Still it is fun and I do not regret spending the money to buy it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Well it's really fun but the regeneration of the coins take forever :( super fun game though!! At first I was I like 0-o now I'm like :D
B003JLA4KS|5.0|This was a really great story to watch. It makes you appreciate these guys so much more. Definitely recommend for the Rush fan in your life!
0385523912|5.0|Barbara Demick's \\"Nothing To Envy\\" is easily one of the best books written about North Korea.  The book tells the story of 6 different North Koreans, most living in the poor city of Chongjin.  The book is non-fiction and the stories \\"Nothing To Envy\\" tells are compiled from various interviews the author conducted with the subjects.  The book however reads like a novel instead of a series of interviews, which makes it that much more compelling.  We're told of two young North Korean lovers, a child who steals to survive, a mother blindly devoted to Kim il-Sung and many others.<br /><br />All in all this is a fantastic book that had me tearing and choking up often because it is so haunting and personal.  I give this book five stars.
1416583432|3.0|I had SUCH high hopes for this book. I was really excited to read it, but I gotta say, it just puts me to sleep. The authors writing style feels like she is trying really, really hard to prove to herself that she is &#34;smart about dogs.&#34; Or about anything. It feels like a text book, and not at all what I was hoping for. (I was hoping for a style more like Cesar Millan, informative but still FUN to read!)<br /><br />That said, there is somre really cool information you can learn from it, but it's almost better to have someone else ready the book and then have them tell you the cool things they (boringly) had to read about. Sorry Ms. Horowitz...but I'm not at all impressed.
034580404X|5.0|I loved these books so much I have read them 3 times now! One of the best trilogy series I have read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the detail the story had I could not put the book down. I recommend this book to everyone. Now I have to research the movie and start the second book, like now!
B005LAIGSM|5.0|THERE IS EVERYTHING GOOD WHEN CHANNING TATUN ISD IN A MOVIE. THE COLOR IS GREAT. NICE SCENES. VERY NICE FOR THE PRICE.
B004J64QSI|4.0|Although this has excellent sound, the orchestra is muffled (the 10th Anniversary's orchestra is crystal clear in comparison) and Nick Jonas left a lot to be desired in terms of vocal power. Katie Hall's voice was also on the weak side. Aside from that, Norm Lewis as Javert was absolutely brilliant, conveying a tremendous range of emotions, just with his voice. The staging, even as a concert, was also excellent, far above that of the 1995 presentation. Not having to flip the disc in the middle of the concert is an added plus and the added bonus of the four Valjeans and comments by Mackintosh and collaborators was a welcome addition. The 10th anniversary concert is still the best recorded and this represents a welcome addition on blu-ray.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I enjoy having the local conditions at the touch of a button. I have no problems with it at all. When I found that I could scroll across the top and find the hourly forecasts for the next 24 hours I was hooked!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Another great book in the series. You never know who is going to be left out of the next book. The author is not afraid to kill off any of your favorite characters.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Awesome! just awesome! all the different customizations, waking up to my favorite songs and i suppose if you had a personal recording saved to your Kindle, you could use that too...I HIGHLY recommend this app! More than the worth of 2 measly dollars, and I'm poor!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this book! I laughed, I cried and can't wait to read the follow up book Point of Retreat!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|easy to read on kindle. obviously, a classic book. but it is very long and probably not for the casual reader
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My child loved this book!!!She is still in love with it,she will not stop talking about it!!! I even read it!! You should get this book!!!!
1881273873|5.0|This book has been great.I always go back to this book. Great motivation for those who are struggling in their singleness. It teaches the importance of being whole and knowing who you are in Christ.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|If u like family guy style comedy ur goin to love this movie it had me laughing from begining till the end
B000HBKCDC|5.0|It dosen't get much better than this for un-tradtional Christmas music.  First heard &#34;the River&#34; on a sampler Christmas CD.  Fell in love with it immeadiately.  My first,but I am sure not last, Sarah Mclachlan.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Love it, love it, love it.  The last one I purchased ended up being cheaper when it actually shipped.  Amazon gave me the difference back.  Super cool.  This series RULES!!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I am actually pretty lucky, because when I got this, it was the free game of the day,and I played it ever since! I also think 4.99 is a good price for it because this is a really long game, also it is pretty hard, trust me you will have hours of fun if you buy this game! Me and my brother plat this game all the time, we try to see who can beat the level the quickest!
B007Y1ARLA|5.0|Last month, the basic edition of Strangeland was super cheap, so I purchased that and bought the 4 extra songs from the \\"Deluxe\\" album to go along with it as well.  I first listened to Sovereign Light Café on Youtube and got hooked that way- had to buy the album after that. I love that song!  I quickly began to like all the other songs, too.  I love Sea Fog and Strangeland.  I don't care for Black Rain, Run with Me, or The Boys.  I also like that these are songs I like, but my kids can listen to and sing along to in the car as well.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Just as good as the first home alone. Same plot but different scene and action! I highly recommend this movie!
0634022296|5.0|I am learning guitar, and love the Beatles so this was a no brainer. The book has all of their songs. Some are not too fun to play on guitar, but they are all there and easy to follow. Each song has finger placement for the chords that will be used in that specific song. So all you need is a guitar, this book, and a capo to play all the Beatles Song. If you or someone you know plays guitar and loves the Beatles this would be an awesome gift. It is also nice to have the chord progressions laid out correctly, not like the tabs online.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I'm having fun playing this. makes me feel like a kid again. The graphics are cool too. Great way to pass the time.
0811879542|5.0|My daughter bought this book for my 3 year old granddaughter. It arrived in the mail today. I have never seen my granddaughter respond to a book as she did this one. My granddaughter thought the book was magic. She clapped, pressed, shook, blew and laughed the entire way through it. It was absolutely wonderful to see. We read it over and over and over....<br /><br />In my humble opinion.... it is a must have!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It is fun for the whole family. This edition of  Angry Birds are challenges not seen elsewhere. You will love it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Slight historical inaccuracies, which you can look up online. If anything it is too short. I wish they would have made some more episodes.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|At first I thought this book would be a horror story based on the cover and photography inside it.  The cover was what initially drew me into it.  I didn't really know what to expect from it.  I think this story is a hit or miss, you either love it or hate it.  I personally loved the story.  It does have some minor editing flaws, but putting that aside it is a plot full of great fantasy.  The way the children & their stories are described is eerie and fantastic all at the same time.  I really hope they plan for a sequel because I would love to know what happens to Jacob & Miss Peregrine.  The ending was not the best, only because it leaves you asking so many questions.  Like I said, I hope the sequel is near! Overall I loved the book and highly recommend it.
B0079J28NW|5.0|Fast shipment/delivery.  Great quality and packaging...really happy with this purchase!!! I would highly recommend purchasing this item if you are a Beatles fan!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I gave up after Book 1 - as I was so annoyed at the characters and was just not impressed.  But everyone kept pressuring me to read book 2 - so I did and it was better, but still not in love.  I'm trying to read book 3, but it's not holding my attention... I'll get through it, as I rarely will ever given up reading something, but don't like this series like I thought I would:^(
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|To all those people who said this game is to hard,<br />THIS GAME REQUIRES THINKING AND IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU USE YOUR BRAIN. This game is really fun and I like the fact that the pigs are smart and clever. The pigs have always been my favorite. I even have a hat!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an amazing book with so much love and such an amazing story to it. It truly kept me on toes!! Couldn't put it down!!
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is such a great show with lots of interesting characters! Should not have been cancelled. The follow up movie is great too. Highly recommended.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book!! Amazing storyline can't wait for the movie!! Such love ab d respect they have for each other!!
B005JR47R6|5.0|I loved this show so much. It really confused me towards the end of this episode but when I full watch it, I was like what did that just happened
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great.  Starts out simple so you can wrap your brain around how it works.  Progressively it gets much harder.  successful completion of the really hard ones bring such a sense of accomplishment.
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|My dad rented this from a large retailer for $1. I'm SO happy he didn't waste more than that! I understand that there are those out there who LOVE this, but I found it a redundant (how many times can we say the word &#34;this&#34; in a single film?) boring heap of weirdness with some odd, soft-core porn thrown in. Just exactly the type of movie every girl wants to watch with her dad! *note the heavy sarcasm* The acting was fine. Paul Giamatti and Rob Pattinson along with the rest of the cast, ACTED as well as ever. I just didn't like the movie itself. I literally said (during 1 of the 20 times it skipped)&#34;Oh my gosh COME ON! I want to get this over with - it is SO stupid!&#34; Honestly, the only part I even sort of liked was the sequence with Rob & Paul having a discussion; and that's only because I like both actors so much & I thought they interacted very well.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun game for hurry up and wait situations such as ER or DMV.  Best part about it is:  it's free and does not send you on wild goose chases to B_S_ web sites for \\"updates\\" and other such nonsense.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in all of two days!!! It was all you need in a book plus a whole lot more! You thought it was a love story, which it is, but it's so much more than that!! I probably will end up reading it again and again. The twists and turns that are in this book I promise you you'll never see coming. You'll laugh you'll cry you'll smile.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked this book. Looking forward to reading the next book. It will be fun to see the movie later this year.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno is a fun and creative artist. Both of those qualities are on display with this record. While his first record was very &#34;PG&#34; and family friendly, this one is rated &#34;R&#34; and covers many subjects that may not be socially accepted or promoted by the mainstream, general public. With that said, there are still several great, entertaining tracks on the CD, with many with a truly original Bruno sound. And last but not least, every song on the album is written and produced by Bruno himself. There aren't many artists these days that can make that claim and you have to appreciate Bruno for it.
B00005JNDZ|5.0|Definitely not better than the original, though they tried pretty hard. Felt Renee Z was a tad plumper than in the original and that the story line didn't hold my interest as much as the original movie. But I enjoy viewing these three actors/actress in movies, as they are very talented folk.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Truly enjoy this game and I can play whenever I want. Enjoy the multi-player aspect of the game. It is interesting!! Thanks!!
B003L77GGA|5.0|I was sorry to see the final season come to an end.  I am looking forward to the next production.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was excellent.  Well written and a real page-turner.  The theme of the book was very timely, also.  Looking forward to another book by Ms. Picoult.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|This movie is for you if you like the sound of weapons. Turn up the surround and let the bullets fly. It's amazing that this many actors appear in the same movie so how could you go wrong. Excellent camera work overall great movie.
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|I downloaded this app and could never get it to work. Bummed.  Luckily it was free, so not a big deal.
B008BU70HW|4.0|The only regret I have is that I didn't have the capability to view this in color.  A lot of neat background material about the cast and what makes Downton Abbey so special.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Movie not what we were expecting.  Very slow and uninteresting.  Movie download stalled toward the end and we didn't care because it was just plain boring.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this book in one sitting, which I had never been able to do before (I wouldn't suggest doing this unless you want to be punched in the face repeatedly with feelings, however). I absolutely loved how John Green could so perfectly depict a teenager, and I'm a huge fan of his writing style.<br />I'm also not a big fan of teen love stories, because they all seem to be way too cliche and corny for me, but words can't even express how much I loved this one.<br />If you don't read this book, you are making a huge mistake. It's honestly perfect.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is a nice break from words but it can stump.  i enjoy this puzzle and the challenge without being asked to buy
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I have been watching this show since it first came out and I love it.  Seriously not one bad episode.  Recast a few characters, including the original Spartacas, may he RIP, but the show is still just as good.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Wonderfully narrated by Anne Hathaway. This story was amazing. Much better than the movie. I couldn't imagine anyone else as a better narrator.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This like temple run on the beginning of the game but better I mean I love it so much more than one million dollars
B009KS4XRO|5.0|fun game to play. great for just passing time.<br />just that you spend more coins earn trying to use the power ups, and keys.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|This is such an insightful book. I enjoyed every topic discussed. It really explains a topic you so often use, yet know so little about. I love that!
B00884GR0W|5.0|The whole game overall is amazing. I've been playing minecraft for 2+ years and  I got this and I instantly fell in  love with it. Best game to  get if your a minecraft .
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good book,  didn't expect it to end like that. Can't wait to read the final installment. Hopefully it will all come together.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Diary of a wimp<br />y kid third wheel is the best book I have read !<br /><br />it is the best<br /> Book<br />Dairy of a wimpy kid
B0076DELIG|4.0|Love this series. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Characters are very well defined. Feel like you know them.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I read this book 3 times it is one word alone first book I read on my kindle fire.Awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love Percy Jackson and the Olympians and the mark of Athena
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Out of the ordinary series - serial killer with a conscience. Well acted. Riveting. Looking forward to the other six seasons.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I like this book it is a really good book if you r not afraid of scary blood and gore
B00A5IYAGM|5.0|Many critics call &#34;M&#34; a precursor to American film noir. Fritz Lang's shot design was amazing and the young Peter Lori's performance was outstanding. The film is in German with subtitles.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|BBC great graphics, story line was amusing but could have been defined a little better, the puzzles were fun and there was a lot to cover. One of the things that I really liked was that it wasn't too short, and lasted me a couple days.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|But as usual, Ms. Picoult touches the<br />heart of readers with her real life crises<br />situations and wrenches your emotions.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|not as funny as i thought it would be,  it is her life in review and it jumps a bit.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I would recommend starting with the first book, which isn't considered part of the Mitch Rapp series, Term Limits. Like watching 24, you need to start with the &#34;first season&#34; and you will want to read all his books. Well-written and well-researched.  Wish they would make a TV series using his books. It would be as popular as 24!
B004XMMSZG|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS ITEM, AND FOUND IT TO WORK WITHIN LESS THAN ONE MINUTE...GREAT USE FOR MY BOSE SPEAKER DOCK 1...WILL USE IT ON MY PORTABLE MEMOREX IPOD BOOM BOX...THE POOR MAN'S SONOS, WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This book is awesome! Martin is able to tell a page turning story while focusing on multiple characters whose actions affect the others; sometimes leading to desirable circumstances or dire consequences.
0785163174|5.0|My daughter is an artist at a major animation studio. I gave this book to her as a gift. She says it is awesome and appreciates having this entire set in one place.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Excellent book. Of course there is a discussion of Richard's past excesses. However, what is revealing about him is his absolute love of his craft. His embrace of all genres of music and his refusal to rest on his laurels is refreshing when compared to many current artists. Lost in much of the analysis of Richards is that at his core he is a very talented artist who works hard at his craft and loves to play, write and perform.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's a fun, silly waste of time.  Enjoy it as a stress reducer.  Kids will love it and it won't be objectionable to anyone.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|One of the greatest apps of all time !!!<br />Unbelievable no more dictionary just ask<br />The voice define a word for you like magic<br />It does just that if only life would work that<br />Way
B003ZSJ212|4.0|First off I love BR but I hate what they did to Vador at the end of 6. I still love Star Wars on BR I would say that if you don't like what Mr. Lucas did to his films buy the dvd of the orignal cut. If your a fan of the hole saga than this is a great buy because it all here. I'm still keeping the orignal cut dvd's they're great. I am glad that they did not put them on BR as it would have been a wast of money at this point. So if your a fan of the old star wars and hate the remasterd don't buy this product if you buy this product and you have the orignal cut dvd's keep the dvd's. Also keep in mind that the movies are owned by Mr Lucas so if he wants to change them he can he owns them.
B00A3YTC6Q|5.0|I love the dancing in this movie, favorite step up yet. The technology is awesome. Would recommend to anyone who loves artistic dance
B004LWZWGA|5.0|One of the best action movies of the year. Good vs Evil in the ultimate battle. One of the best Batman movies ever.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I've been watching the HBO series, that got me interested in trying the books.  So, just finished the first book in the set.  So far HBO is following the books very closely, which is nice.  My only trouble with the books so far is that the author spends a lot of time describing small & insignificant items.  Taking two pages to describe of how wet or cold someplace is just seems excessive.  This happens a lot in the books.  I will say this in favor of the books, it's easier to follow the family lines.  There are so many characters in the stories.  Having the family trees in the book is a big help in understanding the relationships.  i'll post more when I finish the series.
B0060AY85C|5.0|Amazing. I am surprised this book didn't get more attention. I guess everyone is just used to Toni Morrison's books being wonderful, powerful. The brother - sister bond was especially moving for me.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love 'this'game and also Dragon Story. These can be very addicting games but if you have patience you can do everything without paying any extra money.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I am a casual runner always looking for inspiration and tips on diet and living a healthy lifestyle.  This book delivered that.  It was also interesting to read about Scott`s life and running adventures.  Scott seems like a great guy.  I loved this book.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|i love how the actress protrayed emma. emma is a little overbearing, but the actress who protrays her, makes her quite lovable, despite it.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|It says &quot;New update found&quot;  Clicked to do the update but it's just an option to open the damn app wtf! Where's the fricking update? I never stops doing this update alert either. Tried uninstalling then installing and same shit.
0765325950|1.0|I have the whole series in ebook on my Kindle Fire.  I've requested to read the book on ebook and the publisher has disappointed me.  I refuse to buy the large hardcover and am waiting for Thor to release the digital version.  Come on Thor, Where is the ebook?!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love watching The Walking Dead, it's a great show... Even if the characters are oft annoying. ;o) Was nice to be able to watch through Amazon.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I love this book I can't wait for the third one to come out! I can't believe Alex is alive. What is she going to do? How could she not chose Alex. He practically died for her.<br />I hate that I can't read the other one right now.
1400052181|2.0|I'm happy to have learned about Henrietta Lacks; her life and the contributions her cells made to science. I just wish I hadn't also learned about her family - save one or two souls, they seem entirely too happy to play the role of victim, and not improve their situation(s).
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My favorite series of all time! Will read again and again! I recommend this series to anyone. It is amazing!
B003HV0TN2|5.0|This is my second read of this book and it remains one  of my favourites. Let the author sweep you up in the tale of Kvothe. Not your run of the mill fantasy fiction story. This is more human, realistic and compelling. You will find yourself empathising with Kvothe's struggles and trials. Rothfuss is a master weaver and leaves you hungry to more.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a big fan of the movies based on his books.  This book was like watching a good movie.  Keeps you wondering what the main character is going to do next.
B003WE9WRI|3.0|I read this book after world war z and to be honest I'm glad I did as I found myself skimming over large parts of the book as it revealed nothing new about the genre and was repetitive and quite tedious to read. World war z on the other hand sparkles with originality and I have recommended it to a number of friends.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Dr. Doolittle in a child's mind. Imaginative beyond words. I'm excited to see the movie now that I've read the book. A definite recommendation for readers.
B001JRB16U|5.0|We have been sharing a copy of this movie for years, and my granddaughter has been looking for a copy of her own.  I was so excited to find it for her and she was thrilled to get it, and watched it the night she received it.

0316044695|5.0|There is too much to say about this book, so to summarize, it changed my life. It really did change my life. Because of it, I have become fascinated and enthralled with US Navy SEALs. I read everything I can about them. I have started exercising and swimming. I have memorized much of the US Navy SEAL creed, and I talk to anyone interested about SEALs.<br /><br />I will never be a Navy SEAL, but I will always have a profound love and the deepest respect for them. This book was the catalyst for that love and respect, and there is rarely a day that goes by where I don't think about them.<br /><br />This book is one of the very few books that has the ability to really shape a person and change their very being. I am so grateful it was able to do that with me.
0375805613|5.0|I got this for my grandson and it is even better than the original I bought for my children in the 80's.  It is a smaller size which is better for little hands to hold, and the pages are thicker and sturdier.  Great book~
B00AL1ONN8|1.0|OK I've never been a big T.I. fan, although every now and then he would come out with a catchy tune that I will download to my player. Only a handful of T.I. songs are good to me. As I browse the comments I see people giving this album 5 stars...cool, but their reason is because they say the CD is \\"hard-hitting\\" from the beginning to the end. I would have to respectfully disagree. Bare in mind I come from a time of Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Master P and Tupac days. Anything that they came out with back then was hard-hitting and raw (Deep Bass ,hard lyrics,tight beats). I must say the term \\"hard-hitting\\" is used way too loosely nowadays with watered down main stream hip hop and copy cat artist fads. When listening to this CD, he has a song with Pink, he is singing the hook on one song, and he has now jumped on the Lex Lueger production bandwagon (which I am really sick of). Personally, I don't think this is hard hitting. When you have a tv show about being a family man, do songs with Pink, and use the same tired beats that has been clogging up the radio airwaves these days, it doesn't move me. Everything sounds the same to me..wheres the gangster-ness in this album?? I don't understand peoples mind frame nowadays and it's sad. I just think people are fed whatever these music corporations say is hot and they jump on whatever is the fad no matter how much these artist are copying beats and lyrics from eachother. I think rap music needs a complete overhaul..this album proves it...

B009E3EXMU|4.0|I love Zeppelin as much or more than anyone.  Nothing will ever touch The song remains the same for me, but this was pretty good.  Jimmy's solos were off at times and Roberts voice shows his age, but it was overall a good experience.  What made it worth while for me was the setlist including favorites that only real zeppelin fans know like \\"For your life\\" (that I never got to hear live before) and \\"Nobody's fault but mine\\".  I wished they had played the Rain song.  Certainly not their best performance ever, but what do you expect at this point really?<br /><br />If you truly love live Zeppelin, you should get the Black Crowes & Jimmy Page Live at the greek CDs.  I was fortunate to have seen two of those shows.  A dream come true with my favorite two bands melded into one.<br /><br />The sound mix sounds great on my Surround sound and it is HD, which is nice too.
B007M45PMU|5.0|The Lumineers bring a unique, refreshing sound to today's music. Anyone who likes Mumford & Sons or the French band Revolver would enjoy The Lumineers' similar chamber-pop style!
B000002JSJ|5.0|This is flat out one of the best and the most ignored Zeppelin album ever.  It's amazing, simply put.  I won't rehash the details, but it's one of my favorite Zep albums and very upbeat, other than the lone blues track, which is classic Zep and amazing Jimmy guitars everywhere.<br /><br />When you hear this album, you just wonder where the band could have gone had Bonham not died so young.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Could not stop reading this story, until it was over.  Such and up and down relationship, with amazing supporting and main characters.  I cannot wait to read book #2

B001PPLIEQ|5.0|Something has happened to James Bond... betrayal has changed him, and the pain lingers like a raw nerve... his handler struggles to rein him in and fears that he may be beyond her control. Rather than fighting him, M decides instead to aim him in the right direction and let lose the chains.<br /><br />Having captured the mysterious Mr. White, MI6 rushes to uncover a clandestine organization... but Bond has a personal stake in this mission. Fueled by anger he tracks down enemy operatives and kills them, going on a bloody rampage that takes him across paths with Camille Montes, a woman with similar goals to his own. She too has seen loved ones die, and like him, she seeks to bring those responsible to justice. They are both damaged, both marked by pain and anger that may just swallow them whole without a direction to run with it, but together they may just find some small measure of peace... a \\"quantum of solace\\".<br /><br />The mark of Casino Royale is undeniably evident throughout Quantum of Solace ... if the previous film was Part 1 of Bond's origins, than this entry might well be called Part 2. The story picks up immediately after the events of Casino Royale and continues with the unspoken assumption that viewers are familiar with Vesper Lynd and the criminal organization funded through Le Chiffre. Once more, Daniel Craig plays a very human and gut-wrenching performance as James Bond, and Judi Dench plays M, the current director of MI6 and his handler. Giancarlo Giannini makes a return as Rene Mathis, and they are joined by Malthieu Amalric as the villain Dominic Greene, and Olga Kurylenko as the bitter Camille.<br /><br />For some unfortunate reason... Quantum of Solace did not go well with audiences. No one understood the themes at play, and either complained at the lack of \\"Bond-ness\\" or the excessively embellished action. Both views seem too shortsighted--Quantum of Solace isn't about suave sleuthing and shaken martinis because that is not where the character is at: Bond has been broken down, and it is irrational to expect him to be over the events of the previous movie. The supposedly \\"excessive\\" action is necessary because Bond is a violent man... and he expresses himself through violence. The raw, murderous rampage exemplifies the man's emotional state and provides the thematic crux of the film...critics and moviegoers alike seem to have forgotten that action can be used for more than just thrills.<br /><br />Despite the shift in perspective for this entry, old habits die hard: Bond's clever quips as he interrupts the comm channels of an enemy discussion, the playful banter he uses to seduce Agent Fields all make an appearance. Also evident is the strong female lead developed in Casino Royale--Camille Montes is an entirely different kind of \\"Bond-girl\\" from Vesper Lynd, but she possesses no less depth or chemistry with Bond himself--audiences seem to confuse Bond's failure to bed her as lacking a meaningful relationship, which only seems to exemplify the superficiality of previous films in the series. Rather than seduce her, Bond teaches her to kill and gives her the tools to seek her own path--be it vengeance or redemption. Throughout the film she matches his strength and resolve all the way up until the desert hotel goes up in flames and reminds her of a traumatic childhood event and Bond is given the chance to redeem himself from Vesper's horrific death by performing a mercy-killing. The setup and payoff is pitch-perfect.<br /><br />The layers of theme and emotion expressed between Camille and Bond in the cave scene flit between buried rage, an obligation to the dead, post-traumatic shock, a sense of comfort and companionship, and a desire for peace... and both actors manage to convey all of these emotions all at once. For the first time, we are able to see Bond have a meaningful relationship with a woman that doesn't involve sex or manipulation, but an actual sharing of individual identities. For the first time, Bond connects with someone in a genuine moment, rather than creating a relational farce--Bond may have loved Vesper, but he never really knew her.<br /><br />Finally, there is Dominic Greene, whose plan is merely to control a natural resource, while depriving it to the people who truly own and need it. He is a thief, and in some ways the worst kind--because rather than trying to stop him, the British and Americans want to work with him. Greene is clearly a villain... but Bond is the only one even willing to see it because he has experienced the suffering firsthand, whereas everyone else (even M) can just bury their heads in the sand and disappear in the bureaucracy. What happens when the very government Bond works for is inadvertently part of the problem--how does he protect Queen and country when none of them even want him to? Despite being emotionally compromised, Bond is the only one seeing clearly and willing to do his duty... despite the accusations of his superiors, he's the only one that isn't blind.<br /><br />Subtle hints of these themes are masterfully woven throughout the story--one can see the complete disregard of Western governments for foreign peoples in the US Section Chief's comment about the impurities of the water and how \\"you can't trust a damn thing around here\\". He is so blinded that he can no longer see people... he views them as filth and pests rather than worthwhile human beings, and Bond suggests they all go out and actually see the city and its people.<br /><br />Quantum of Solace may not be any kind of a master-work--but neither are any of the 007 movies, and this film is every bit the equal of Casino Royale. The action is top-notch and used well to support the characters and the plot, and the actor performances are stellar across the board--everyone plays their role and contributes to the whole. More to the point however is that Quantum of Solace is practically a tapestry of ingenuous setups and payoffs: the entire arch of Bond and Camille's relationship, the ironic fate that Bond leaves Greene to die in (referencing both an earlier murder involving oil and Greene's own plot to deprive people of water), and finally... the manner in which Bond decides to deal with Vesper's traitorous boyfriend. In the end, Bond finds his solace... and we are left with one of the best Bond films ever written.ond connects with someone in a genuine moment, rather than creating a relational farce--Bond may have loved Vesper, but he never really knew her.<br /><br />Finally, there is Dominic Greene, whose plan is merely to control a natural resource, while depriving it to the people who truly own and need it.

B001EBWITA|4.0|Apparently I make up for the lesser group that likes this sort of shlocky action films that tie the occult to noir. I am not saying it's the greatest film ever made, but it seems to vibe with all of my likes. There are terrible moments to be sure mostly because Keanu can only project a sort of dazed reaction to everything. But who doesn't like a wise-cracking, gun toting, snarky jackass saving the world from Satan's reign once in a while ?

0765325950|5.0|I am so glad I read this as a hardcover to conclude the series. It brought me back to  when I first read EotW 20 years ago, and I appreciated the closure that having an actual book in my hand provided me to end the journey. It was harder to read in the bathroom or while eating many cheeseburgers at once, or both of those activities simultaneously, which seem to be the leading complaints online at the moment, but it was worth it for me to help Jordan get to the top posthumously for a few extra bucks, especially since the whole series has brought me so much joy over the past two decades. I don't see the value in wasting a lot of time and emotional currency in the e-book controversy. I really love this series, and I do Kindle almost everything now, but for the review bombers: Get over it. Especially you, Greg.
B005RUUUAI|3.0|Season one is taut, mean, rough, uncompromising. Season two, well, isn't. There are moments (I won't reveal here) of greatness, but they are too few and far between. I like Season two, but I don't love it. I'm behind; Season three is DVR'd, so I'll have to wait and see. Last thing I want is another Lost - a once great show that became a silly sex romp and then went back to something worth watching.

0618001905|4.0|I have mixed opinions about this book.  On one hand, I have read much about this period and found \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" to be the best comprehensive discussion of the period.  It is very readable and (when the author restricts himself to the facts) reliable.<br /><br />On the other hand, his work is shot through with psychobabble and the curse of 20:20 hindsight.  For example, he writes, \\"Leopold's letters and memos, forever badgering someone about acquiring a colony, seem to be the voice of a person starved for love as a child and now filled with an obsessive desire for an emotional substitute\\".  Or speaking of the explorer Stanley (of Dr. Livingstone fame), he writes, \\"...one part titan of rugged force and mountain-moving confidence; the other a vulnerable, illegitimate son of the working class, anxiously struggling for the approval of the powerful.\\"<br /><br />He views past happenings with perfect hindsight, but expects the participants in this gruesome story to have 20:20 foresight.  He also filters his writing through a liberal UC Berkeley mesh (I am a Berkeley grad myself).  He assumes that some kind of near-perfect transition was possible from pre-industrial Africa to modern Africa.  Anything that fails to adhere to this perfect model must have been the result of intended evil or moral cowardice.<br /><br />As I have aged, I have found that it is seldom necessary to attribute evil intentions to bureaucracies when incompetence and avarice provide sufficient reason for the results. In part, the author reminds me of those who attribute the horrors of the holocaust to the prejudices Adolf Hitler, without acknowledging that the holocaust was the product of an extensive set of circumstances and peoples.  True, history would undoubtedly been different without individuals named \\"Leopold\\" or \\"Hitler\\" - but perhaps not much better.<br /><br />Regardless of these (as I see them) failings, this is a worthwhile book.  It provides a look into the darker side of mankind's nature, and points out the unintended consequences of colonialism.nature, and points out the unintended consequences of colonialism.

B003IKMR0U|4.0|Pros:<br />This Is a great quick game to play when you only have about 5-10 minutes for a game or you need something quick in between longer gaming sessions.  The rules are simple, it can be learned in about 30 seconds and anyone of ANY age can play.  To prove that last part, a short story:<br /><br />I brought it over to my fraternity house a few months ago over homecoming weekend (we are a bunch of gaming geeks).  One of my friends had brought his 4 year old daughter with him for the day and she happened to be with us in the living room while I was explaining the game.  Her mother told her it was a game for grown ups, but that she could watch us play.<br /><br />The game works like this: you are a zombie, trying to run after people and eat their brains.  On the dice are three symbols: a shotgun blast, footprints and brains.  You roll three dice at a time, continuing until you decide to stop and score the number of brains you collected, or you get shot 3 times, scoring no points.  You re-roll the dice any time that you see the footprints (it means your victim ran away from you).  Once your turn is over, hand the dice cup to the person on your left and continue until someone scores at least 13 brains.<br /><br />And so, despite the mature premise of the game, 4 year old Erin watched us play intently.  Two rounds in, she walked away.  We assumed she lost interest, but a few minutes later her father returned and said she was on the porch, pouting.  When asked why, she told him she \\"wanted to eat brains, too...\\"  It was adorable!  We let her in on the next round and she scored higher in one turn than any of the rest of us in our 3 turns.  On her next turn, she scored enough brains to win the game!  We had been using pennies to keep score and her father asked if she could keep the pennies, that she was already talking about putting them in her piggy bank at home.  Even more adorable!  It was a lot of fun to see 7 frat boys get their butts kicked by a 4 year old at a dice game.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Dice cup is starting to fall apart after a few months.  Be sure to tell people to keep a hand on both ends when they shake it - more than a few times I have had the bottom come off and dice fly everywhere!<br /><br />Bottom line: great quick party game.  Have recommended it to many friends.

1409116328|5.0|I find it that the hardest reviews to write are those for books that I loved most. It just feels that there are no words powerful enough to express how happy this novel made me. I formed a close connection to this story, and had I made a list of 2012 favorite reads, Eleanor and Park would be perched up very high on it. It felt personal, and it felt mine.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1986, a year before I was born. I am old enough to remember making mix tapes, running out of batteries in walkmans and begging for privacy talking on the land-line phone because, well, what other options were there? 90-s nostalgia aside, I highly enjoyed this novel for numerous reasons. Both Eleanor and Park are very-well rounded and multi-layered characters that you can't help but fall in love from the word go. Since the story is told from two perspectives, we gain enough insight into their lifestyles which define who they are-Eleanor coming from a broken and unstable home, Park defined by his ethnicity. When they clash, surprise, it's not insta-love. I loved watching them slowly bonding over music, comic books and common misfit issues, and this is where the personal connections comes in. Some of the conversations between the two of them sounded like echoes of conversations that Darling and I had. I many ways Eleanor reminded me of myself, especially in her shortcomings. Just like Park does to Eleanor, my boyfriend introduced me to the awesomeness that is Watchmen (among others). So when I say that the characters were relatable, and their conversations and voices realistic, I mean it from the bottom of my heart.<br /><br />The romance is not a typical love story, and there is no happy ending, just something that has to happen. My heart skipped a beat at the last page and reminded me what Eleanor and Park's story is all about-love against all odds, and finding yourself in spite of all obstacles.<br /><br />Eleanor and Park was, in short, charming, witty, entertaining, emotional, a guaranteed re-read and definite favorite.<br /><br />(Discalimer: I received an egalley for review. There was no monetary compensation and no obligation to write a positive review.)guaranteed re-read and definite favorite.<br /><br />(Discalimer: I received an egalley for review.

B00407PNY2|5.0|I watched this on cable many years ago with my dad such a great movie and one of the best car chases ever.
B00004YA66|5.0|This film was much, much better than I expected and I spend a nice moment watching it. The review below contains some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />\\"Frequency\\" is a very original and well thought variation on the theme of time travelling - but with a BIG twist. The story begins in New York in 1969, when the main character, John Sullivan, is only 6 years old and continues in the same place thirty years later, when he is 36. Jim Caviezel (mostly known for his outstanding performance as Jesus in \\"Passion of Jesus Christ\\") plays the adult John Sullivan, a somehow depressed and borderline alcoholic police officer, who was just dumped by his girlfriend. Denis Quaid plays the equally important role of John's father, firefighter Francis Sullivan - and he is EXCELLENT in this role. In 1999 Francis Sullivan is no more around and his son misses him greatly. And then one evening, when tinkering with the old radio he inherited from his father, John Sullivan will start a conversation with another radio amateur operator, who also lives in New York and who sounds oddly familiar...<br /><br />What follows is a very interesting tale of mystery, tragedy and history changing, mixed with elements of thriller. There are parts of this film which really kept me on edge, especially considering that main characters are pretty likeable and I was seriously worrying about both of them, as things were getting more and more dangerous for them... Also, the ending was pretty surprising and I did not see it comming. There is also a really, REALLY bad guy in this film - and the low key, low drama way in which he is pictured made him actually even scarier...<br /><br />Pay great attention to TV broadcastings which can be seen (or sometimes only heard) discreetly in the background and also to newspaper titles of which the most important appear mostly on the very bottom of the screen...<br /><br />I am not going to say anything more and if you want to see this film try not to read too much about it. The twists and surprises are a particularly important thing in \\"Frequency\\".<br /><br />I give to this little known film five stars, because it very pleasantly surprised me, impressed me even in one or two scenes and I spend a really, really good moment watching it. Enjoy!twists and surprises are a particularly important thing in \\"Frequency\\".<br /><br />I give to this little known film five stars, because it very pleasantly surprised me, impressed me even in one or two scenes and I spend a really, really good moment watching it.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Another unnecessary app to amuse yourself during a dead space.  This app is only the basics, however, there are other apps if you are a serious gamer.
B00A6I87UQ|4.0|As a long time (but inactive) amatuer astronomer, my paper atlas is seldom with me when a question arises.  No more.  Having this on my smart phone allows answers in minutes, anywhere, anytime.  The only downside is slightly awkward navigation: go easily from map to map, but the size of the image is too small to easily see.  Touch the screen to permit magnification (which works well), and I can't move to another map without returning to the index.  Maintaining the form of the atlas in page format is certainly expedient in getting this out to users; however, current technology should be able to create a seamless sky map.  Maybe next year...
B004M8S2X8|3.0|I had high hopes for this based on the other books of Johns that I have read (Looking for Alaska and The Fault in Our stars). It started off promisingly but unfortunately fizzled out. I found that after the initial excitement the storyline dragged out with not a great deal happening, and a degree of repetition.

B0055PGUYU|3.0|If you're not a sports fan you may have some trouble staying interested. I get it that the message is all the same, and it's not really about football, but at times it feels like it is.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was riveted.  This novel is exciting, smart, and well written.  I have had to pry myself away from it to return to reality.  But I have to say, it has the most disappointing ending to a novel that I have ever had the misfortune to experience.  I read other reviews in which people stated they were unhappy with the ending, but I thought they may have just not liked the way the writer summed it all up.  I am here to say: that is not the case at all.  This book has NO ENDING!  It simply stops, and it leaves readers like me disappointed and wanting more.  It seems like the author just got tired of writing.  What happened?
1432794426|5.0|I have just finished reading Dr. Karen's book, Defending A King~ His Life & Legacy.....this is a wonderful book about Michael Jackson the man as opposed to the beloved \\"King Of Pop\\". Dr. Karen has touched on many subjects surrounding MJ's life, including his triumphs as well as his tribulations. It is informative as it speaks of his highly unusual life, the isolating lonliness & the \\"witch Hunt\\" that ensued to<br />bring him down !!! It also speaks of his amazing Humanitarian efforts on behalf of children and adults all over the globe,I knew Michael Jackson for over 30 years, we met because I was a severely ill as a teenager, a mere 16 1/2 yrs old, who had all but given up hope on life....until Michael Jackson came and met me and changed my life forever. Michael did what so many parents have said countless times before,\\" Michael Jackson saved my child !\\" The Michael Jackson I knew was nothing like the Michael Jackson that the media portrayed and if you read this book, maybe you will understand more of the complexities that came in and out of this mans life,and  how he always dealt with adversity from a place of LOVE in his heart,never hating or becoming bitter.Most importantly, his undying desire to heal us and our planet of hurt, sickness and destruction. I have read alot of books about Michael Jackson and I have to tell you this is one of my favorites.....If you truly want to understand what it was like for Michael to be the most famous person in the world, the good and the bad, then please read Dr. Karen's book. It will definitely make you see the light !!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good book so far.  Enjoying reading this - I am in midst of reading it now.  looking forward to finishing it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put down this book once I started reading. Gillian Flynn wrote a smart suspenseful novel. I highly recommend Gone Girl.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked this book. However, the eroticism of the book seemed to get somewhat repetitive. The ending caught me completely off guard and was a very good cliffhanger. I'm excited to start the second book and see where Ana and Christian go from there..
1416550550|5.0|The plot in this book is constant. The story takes place with different people at different time. I juggled with the chapters in the book coming back to the previous chapters. It is like a puzzle. Very interesting way to read a book. I loved it.

This is one of those albums along with Imagine and john lennon plastic ono band that will stand the test of time.Mind Games starts out with the classic title track and includes beautiful songs such as one day at a time,aisumasen(i'm sorry) and intuition as well as the expected rockers tight as,only people and the classic meat city. A must have for any Lennon, Beatle or just rock and roll fan. Mind Games is a must have in any collection.

B002I0J5FG|4.0|ICO:<br />I played ICO, what feels like, ages ago. I loved it! The visual style was more artsy, with a sun drenched, washed out aspect. The story was interesting and I loved figuring out how to get by the \\"puzzles\\". The shift in environment near the end was great and it left an impression that many games fail to leave with me.<br />Fast forward to the release of this combo and I was wondering how well the game would hold up for me. I should not have worried. The enhanced visuals are nice, with a crisper image. The game is the same, even left me with that same wonderful impression.<br />Details on game mechanics:Hitting attack swings the object you are holding, pretty much sums it up! You can throw larger objects and you can jump. You scale objects and can jump from ledges to ledges, climb stairs, etc. Yes, the combat is pretty tame, however when they start throwing many enemies at you while you are trying to move heavy blocks as part of a puzzle and trying to protect the girl that's with you, it can get pretty intense. As far as sound goes, it is primarily ambient noise. Waves, seagulls, grinding gravel as you move blocks,etc. I think of it as very similar to Journey in many aspects of the sound department, although there is a lot more emotive music in Journey.<br />SoTC:<br />I never had a chance to play this way back when so my impressions are not based on any nostalgia like ICO. The stories/characters in the two games have been hinted at being connected in some way, with one as a sequel or prequel, although officially they are not connected. It is a game in which your goal is essentially to defeat all the colossi in the land, each giving you it's shadow powers, with the hope of raising a girl from the dead. Each Colossi is quite beautiful and are a variety of animal types (well, many of them are). You have a faithful steed that helps you travel across the land and also assists in your battles with the Colossi (if you are skilled at horseback fighting). The battles are very reminiscent of other games, like God of War where you are crawling all over an enemy finding weak points. This is the game's high point and low point, I felt. The main problem is the out-dated controls. In ICO the enemies are fairly simplistic so the fighting is easy to overlook, in SoTC, it's a frustration fest at certain points. I had a hard time trying to determine if it was truly the controls that frustrated me or that it was designed to be hard in the first place.<br />  Let me preface this with a personal note. I have no problem with hard games. I have a Plat on Dark Souls (beat it 3 times with the same character). That game, I also felt, had control issues that made me question whether it was the controls versus actual difficulty, but that's an aside.<br />The sounds, very much like ICO, are primarily ambient noise. The battles are appropriately dramatic and the cinematic scenes have a kind of spookiness to them.<br />Visually, it feels a lot like ICO with the bright, washed out world. There are some beautiful vistas and interesting landmarks.<br /><br />Both games have a variety of collection side quests (with associated trophies). And beating them multiple times unlocks items and challenge modes. I seriously recommend these games to both the art house fans and the standard gamer. There are so many carbon copy games out there that having a new(old) take on games is refreshing and reminds you why games are so fantastic. Specifically, if you like to step into worlds that aren't a continuous \\"on rails action sequence\\" and really explore and feel out your world(s) then I think you will really enjoys these games. Different, is a positive moniker for these games. :)
B0000AUHPK|5.0|Ok i LOVE this movie Its one of my favorite books and i think this movie is just as good check it out you will love it
B000059TEQ|4.0|Not really my cup of tea this one but bought it for a friend who loved it. No depth to the  basic story line, built around the sentimentality that she is dying, so you know the ending. Just too sloppy for me, but to millions worl wide it was described as a Classic !
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Another winner for Nicholas Sparks.  With a<br />surprising ending, it will stand tall among his<br />other best-selling books.  Possibly another<br />movie.
146500632X|4.0|This was a gift to a 10 year old girl and she absolutely loved it.<br />So I would recommend to any 1D fans.

B009E3EYS8|5.0|There have been some less than spectacular Led Zep reunions over the years in which Jimmy's guitar didn't sound that hot and the band sounded unrehearsed (and who can forget the mistake of getting Phil Collins on drums for one of them?).  This is not one of those.  You can tell from the beginning that the band practiced meticulously, as their timing and grooves are perfect!  Jimmy's guitar tone is back to where it should be, and I'm amazed at how well he plays for being his age.  The DVD picture quality is very good, production is excellent, sound is equally great.  Turn this up while watching to enhance the feel & power of the songs!  Great timing demonstrated by the band in For Your Life, Nobody's Fault But Mine, The Song Remains the Same, In My Time of Dying and others.  No doubt they ran over these songs with a fine toothed comb to make them all work so well.  The band tunes down some songs to aid Robert's voice, but it all works quite well in the grand scheme of things.<br />If there were anything missing from the DVD, it's that it would be nice if there were some extras.  The only thing on the DVD is the concert footage; no back stage scenes or interviews or anything.  Anyway, if this is Led Zeppelin's last show, at least they went out on a high note.  Jason plays his dad's beats absolutely perfectly, Jimmy is full of energy, JP Jones is very musical and steady as a rock and even Robert seems to be into it, even if only for one night.  Great purchase for a Led fan!  I can't say enough good things about how great they sound and how tight they are.  Unlike some other Led reunions of the past, this is one the guys can really be proud of.
B0063IH60K|5.0|You can't go wrong with Solitaire.  It's a classic and this is fun.  Love playing it while watching TV during the commercials.
B008B9JSD2|5.0|This movie is about decisions and choices. What happens when everything you ever wanted is offered to you?Most of us would accept it. What happens if you know within your heart that you are not the one?  Would you be willing to stand as a minority of one to say, \\"I'm not up to it.\\"  It can be a moment when we face a fork in the road.  A moment when we know no matter what our choice is, we will never be the same again.  That is the question that \\"We Have a Pope\\" keeps asking. It holds a mirror to our own souls.<br /><br />This movie begins in the conclave of cardinals to choose a new pope.  The cardinals are in a deadlock.<br />Again and again, they try to arrive at consensus.  They can't. They choose a compromise candidate instead.  The new Pope is aging, very kind, and bemused by it all. When he learns the news of his elevation, he screams and passes out.  Against all urging, he knows that he is not the one to be Pope. Its not stage fright but his deep personal conviction.  What does he do? He slips out of the conclave and onto the streets of Rome.  He encounters people of all kinds.  He asks himself is he one to be Pope? Or would he rather have a simpler life?<br /><br />This is a gentle, spiritual, and humorous movie. Its most amusing moments as the church officials try to explain the absence of the new pope. Its most touching moments are as the new Pope discovers his path.<br /><br />But is makes its point: all of us need to follow the journey to find our true selves.  If you are a Christian, it means finding your soul.  Alan Minarcik
B00A757EFW|2.0|it was really to hard to do on my Kindle.  Didn't care for it and it was boring compaired to the newer games on here.
B000FBFML6|3.0|I'll preface this by stating that I really enjoy the series as a whole. Unfortunately this book falls well short of its companion books.<br /><br />I had to force myself through the book, and while doing so I couldn't get the \\"Woe as me\\" mentality out of my head. Every character with the exception of two suddenly seem to have reduced themselves to pouty children who have lost all sense of independence and maturity. Always bemoaning how bad they're treated, how horrible their current lives are, or how poorly others act toward them, and often falling into petty arguments when a glaringly obvious solution is staring them right in the face. To make matters worse,the same characters spend too much time repeating the same arguments or temper tantrums in multiple chapters. The redundancy is grueling. The main character seems to act less mature than he was in Assassin's Apprentice, when he was a child and expected to act immaturely. Many other supporting characters seem to devolve as well.<br /><br />So why do I give it 3 stars if I seemingly didn't enjoy the book? I suppose the series as a whole probably influences my reluctance to give it less. As well there are a few nuggets of interesting reading, and I can't fault the author's writing. Oddly, while the book does have its merits, the story itself is just \\"blah\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So emotional. Couldn't put it down. I read the whole thing in less then two days, couldn't put it down
B004KWVDWI|5.0|What a wonderful package deal, so love the movie always keeps you on the go with each new chapter, amazing and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it the real deal, not out dated, up with all the modern movies and even better. Worth the purchase for sure. Barbara Petersen. Australia.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have recommended this to all my friends and family. it has great ideas about almost every thing you could want to make or have someone make for you.
0765325950|5.0|I have been following this series for the last 15 years and I must say that this book is perhaps the most perfect ending to it. Over the last year, I have tried to come up with multiple theories of my own as to how the story will end but this is much better than all my theories put together. Kudos to Jordan and Sanderson!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Very user friendly and enjoyable to play. Much easier to use than the other games downloaded. Fits screen size well.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|ever needed to calculate something but no calculator? yup me too thats why i got this little handy app for just that. never know when u might need it.
B004X4R49Y|4.0|Colin Firth, Jeffery Rush and Helena Bonham Carter were magnificent. The story was very interesting, understated, yet intently personal look at a slice of history as experienced by these three people. It was an up close and personal perspective, but not full of a lot of details or context about the time period.<br /><br />I believe that the more you know of the times and situations, the better your enjoyment of the movie will be, but it is not absolutely required because the story is really about a prominent  mans' struggle with a speech impediment, in a time when such things were considered an embarrassing deformity, and the historical context, just enriches the understanding of the stakes involved.<br /><br />The secondary characters, especially those close to the throne and the politics of the time, were much less well developed and tended to be more one dimensional. Which allowed time to put more focus on the children and personal family lives of both men, but it still felt a little truncated, and unsatisfying. I have seen several documentaries on Churchill, Chamberlain and King Edward/Wallis Simpson love affair/scandal and the beginnings of WWII in general, and was able to place them in context to the story. I would have been completely confused by the trauma represented in the subtle reference to the story of Prince Albert's younger brother, if I had not seen it on a PBS show.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars because the movie will just be a much richer experience, if you are already familiar with the history of the Royal Family and the times.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is kinda a neat little doodling app for the kids to keep them busy while you do your errands so they are entertained.

B001RNO7AS|5.0|The Teva Riva Hiking Shoe provides for me a good fit with a nice design and is well made.<br /><br />I'm planning a trip to Europe in the Spring.  That means lots of walking, cobblestones, stairs and some great hikes.  I'm a long time fan of Teva, owning a pair of leather sandals(18 years and counting) and a pair of Dozers, which serve me well on numerous aggressive hikes.<br /><br />For Italy and Ireland, I wanted a closed shoe, that still looks nice and can hold up without killing my feet after a day of trekking around historic centers, churches, museum, mountains, rain, rocks and such.  I pack light and only take one pair of shoes. I think this pair will do it.<br /><br />My family was in the shoe business when I was growing up, and I will say, as a preface, that shoes are very personal.  Not just in style, but how they fit each, individual's foot.  There's always a certain amount of uncertainty; even when you try them on in a store, which may give you idea if there's something really wrong with them, but you, still,  may not know how they suit you until you've worn them for awhile.<br /><br />These are quality made shoes.  Waterproof leather upper, solid treaded Vibram soles, good enough arch support, and what I really like,  the protective toe. I constantly scrape the toes of my shoes.  I've  had no rubs or friction points including at the achilles; they're lightweight- less is better for me.<br /><br />After going through the reviews, I ordered a 1/2 size larger, and they fit perfectly snug and not uncomfortable for me.  Feet are asymmetrical, and if you like to wear thick socks or have one foot that's much bigger, you might go a full size larger.<br /><br />I'll update my review after the big trip.  Now take a hike!<br /><br />Update: the shoes did great for me! Rushing through numerous airports, walking the streets of Dublin, lots of walking in hilly Rome and historic hillside towns, trekking for 6 hours up and down the Sibilini mountains of Umbria, hiking the Irish countryside- they still look and feel good- I'm wearing them at work.

B00A757EFW|3.0|You must have a stylist to play this game.  It is almost impossible to play without one.  I would enjoy more if the mazes were a little bigger in design.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay was a riveting book that kept me glued to the pages.  Collins did a nice job again with her conclusion to this trilogy.
0553328255|5.0|Hard to put down. Highly recommended. This collection should be read by everyone that enjoys mysteries and thrillers that don't need all the R-rated content.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I became a Taylor Swift fan right out of the gate when her debut album dropped in late 2006.  And she wasn't just ANY country gal; she could sing it like the rest of them!  She let the world know who she was and that she meant business.  Several years later -- and several EP's in between -- Taylor's next big record is yet another mega-smash.  Quite simply, a lot of the songs on here are hit-packed.<br /><br />For example, there's the upbeat title track -- which is also one of my personal favorites.  Then you have the two pop crossover hits currently on heavy rotation:  \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\" and \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\\"  Speaking of that, I loved watching Taylor's STELLAR performance of both songs on New Year's Rockin' Eve 2012 (which was just 2 weeks ago, mind you).  Yes, she knows how to bring it!<br /><br />A few more of my favorite personal tracks are \\"Stay Stay Stay\\", \\"The Lucky Ones\\" and the duet with Mister Snow Patrol himself -- \\"The Last Time.\\"  The pairing seems very fitting if you listen to how the song actually sounds.  Then there's \\"Sad Beautiful Tragic\\", another personal fave.<br /><br />As most people already know, Taylor is known for writing a breakup song about one of her ex's.  But hey, it still makes for some great music, doesn't it?!  It's sometimes fun to guess just whom she is writing about.  But once in a while, she will step out of her usual comfort zone to write a third-person view song, such as for The Hunger Games soundtrack (i.e., \\"Eyes Open\\".)  I truly don't believe that there's nothing Taylor CAN'T do.  She has truly outdone herself, so I look forward to what she brings for her next album.
B00432QAKK|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas surprise. We watch a few episodes a night. The only thing that I don't like about this series is that there are so many discs. I think there are 32. It makes you have to change out the discs more often then I think we should have to.<br />Jefferson is our favorite character. Love this show!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was a totally ramdom choice,  I have sheep and llamas so I searching for a good farm story. I downloaded the trial edition, and although it has nothing to do with fiber animals I couldn't but it down. I highly recommend this book.

098357670X|5.0|A very didactic book that teaches a lot of ways to see and break a subject to translate to a caricature together with a lot of examples.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|This book reminds me of any talk or story I have had with most any vet.News Media strikes again at turning something promising into a so-so.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Olympus Good price and performs to expectations.  Has the memory needed for job performance.  Do not hesitate to purchase this item
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|I'll give it a 3 because I feel it gives the answer to soon by the time I run my eyes down the page the answer is there it seems like the game is playing its self their answer may be better than my choice but I want time to make that decision also if we run out of matches it seems we should get points not lose the game as if we run out of matches it seems like that means we did good
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Great book! I would read it again. The author did a great job writing the book! I could really imagine the character s
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The trailer is pretty spot on for this one. If you watch it and you like what you see, you will enjoy the movie. I thought the writing was pretty clever for a teen flick like this one and the singing is out of this world. Enjoyed it more than i thought i would.
B009EE6PTS|2.0|This movie was not very good at all! I mean its like not even a movie all it really is is this guy who has some serious issues recording him and his friend's new \\"abilities\\". Would not recommend.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I just loved it! Well, would have loved it more if the label had put Fade Into You into the mix but I was pleased all the same.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Wow. You see all these apps of the day on your kindle, you get them and you're like &quot;Oh! That's fun!&quot; Those &quot;fun&quot; apps are nothing compared to Plague Inc. Best 99&cent; I ever spent. Anyone who's thinking about buying it should get it right now because it is AWESOME!!!! First time I played I played for 3 1/2 hours. SO ADDICTING. I LOVE IT. Best part about it? It's not repetitive. Not like Angry Birds, where you're just pulling your fingers back the whole time. Not like Ninja Fruit, where you're swiping your finger for an hour. You can actually choose the symptoms of your plague, not just move your fingers and let the game do the rest. All in all, this is an awesome app and anyone who can should buy it.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera at royal Albert Hall came in record time and in good condition. It was used as a Christmas present.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Game was a lot of fun except I had to use the hint a lot not very self explanatory<br />Can't wait to play the next one see if it's more dramatic
B0043URV5U|5.0|Bob Seger signs of times past and words that you can understand....67 and enjoying the trip down memory lane..these are some of Segers best
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The 3 rd of the Trilogy lacked the excitement and passion that I found in the first two. I found it hard to imagine or resonate with many of the details the author was trying to describe as the story unwound. The pace was slower and lacked the wow factor the first 2 books did. It is still a good read, but fails to deliver on par with the first 2.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Wonderful movie a definitely worth the rent.  Watched it with my husband, take out and a bottle of wine.....a perfect Friday evening.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read. Written with great talent. Wish I had read it sooner! I can not wait to read the next one.
B0063IH60K|1.0|upon starting the game I got a full screen ad for meeting singles. this app is nothing but a spam machine. don't waste your time.
B0083H6AQA|3.0|This looks like my kind of movie. It is a beautiful costumed and set period piece with plots involving love and intrigue, so why did it not thrill me? First, Pattinson just isn't up to the part. His character is supposed to be a suave, seductive, irresistible social climber, but Pattinson is none of those things. Emotion never reaches his dead eyes. He's flat and unsophisticated. While these ladies might want to roll in the hay with him behind closed doors, he's not someone you'd want to be caught talking to in public much less marrying. While you do get a sense that he doesn't like being poor, he doesn't come across as someone with much ambition of any kind.<br /><br />Second, midway through the movie it starts to develop this cat and mouse Dangerous Liaisons quality to it where the viewer starts to wonder who is the manipulator and who is the pawn? The women, the men, or Duroy/Pattinson? Unfortunately, that is short-lived. Despite the fact that Duroy is horribly inexperienced sop, he magically manages to come up with a few tricks that sets society spinning. The story ends presumably with him on top, but he doesn't appear very happy about any of it, nor does he appear to have \\"won\\" anything.<br /><br />Ricci is the belle of this ball. She's blossomed into a wonderful actress. I've remembered her for weird, flat parts like the little girl in the Adams Family and Sleepy Hollow. She did well, but they weren't parts that required depth and juice. She's got juice now! Scott Thomas is always good as is Thurman.<br /><br />All in all it's a decent film, but I wanted it to be better. It should have been better.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|The translation to English was well done. Action packed and the delivers was really fast. The packing was also well done. Thanks
B001EN71CW|5.0|I enjoyed this series a lot when it aired and being able to get the full series (including unaired episodes) for my collection is great. I enjoy watching this show over and over.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am addicted to getting prizes and bonuses.  If I can no longer buy coins, I wait until there are enough to play with.  I don't seem to know what all there is to know, and would like more information on how to maneuver to coins for maximum points.  I learn as I play.  I like it because I need a game that is slower,  My reflexes as fast as what the kids have.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love the plot line; very relevant today.  Claire Danes is fantastic.  I still can't figure out why everyone, including his wife, calls the main character by his last name (Brody) instead of his first, or why they didn't cast a better-looking actor in this role, but the story is so intriguing I don't mind.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Snyder takes your through his own personal customized way to get to 'THE END'. You may end up extracting only what you need, but any which way you use it, it provides many useful tips and tricks to become a better screen writer - almost regardless which level you are currently at.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|This book was just ok, confusing and a challenge to follow. I wouldn't recommend. Other Albom  books may be better. Good luck
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Everyone should read this book.  America should not take our freedoms for granted and let the Veterans know that we reallize what sacrifices they make for the freedom America has always had.<br />A very amazing journey this man made for his country.  He made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms.
0792833201|5.0|Bought this for my friend who loves the movie and it was in pristine condition. Shipping was very fast and the item was fairly priced.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent story well written and emotional loved every word.<br />It is a must read. I will remember this story always.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is so awesome I think this game is the new subway surfed this game is a game people will never foget.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this application has so many good features. besides being an alarm clock or also gives the weather. I would highly recommend getting this since kindle fires don't come equipped with a clock.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was a slow read until about halfway through it.....once the plot thickened it was impossible to put down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was riveting..read it two days. Well written..well played. Suzanne brought every part of the story to life. For such a twisted tale I loved it and the underlying message.
193609648X|5.0|Beautiful crafted work; so excited it's crochet!  For many years, crochet books were limited.  Now I see more and more, and so many designs, I have a hard time deciding what to do next!
B008I43DYU|5.0|I love this calculator it is so easy to use. The numbers and +, -, =, x and divide symbols are easy to see and touch. I have it downloaded on my Kindle Fire and my smartphone (IPhone 4). When I acquire a new touch computer andd/or a new computer I will most defiantly download this app on it. Thanks for a great app<br />Respectfully, Sharon Smith
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This movie is my favorite ever and no movie has yet been better. Great plot, good characters, great villain, perfect movie. Seen it about 1000  times
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I like hidden object games &amp; this one is a lot of fun!  Puzzles are challenging, but not too tough.  Really enjoying it.
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|I really like the functionality of this app. Now I prefer reading my blogroll on my Kindle instead of on a regular computer. It's not a very stylish app, but it allows me to read through new posts quickly, which is more important.
B0086700CM|4.0|Very enjoyable game, but also very frustrating.  I play it on my Kindle Fire, and the graphics in the game don't present a clear enough image of the course.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|First off, this movie stays true, more or less, to the comic book character and series.  The action and cinematography is dark and gritty with none of the pg-13 garbage that was in the first one.  The acting isn't terrible, and the plot is actually decent.  All in all a decent movie,<br /><br />Brain candy for when you have an hour and a half to blow.
034580404X|5.0|A raw sexual story.  You need to look past the sex and examine the real Mr. Grey and how his childhood scared his mind.
1592402690|5.0|I am on me second go around with this book, which is something I've never done. Geoffrey recollection and insight is crystal clear. Now reading George Martins book and not finding the same detail. Absolutely fascinating!!
1451695195|4.0|This one's for for skeptics, and all those who've learned that books like this are useless at best for helping us come to terms with life.  Doctor Alexander is a brain surgeon who knows his science and brain consciousness facts.  Leaving him unprepared for his 7-day experience while his brain was clinically flat lined--non-operational.  Nor ready for what he learned about reality, and our place in it, and the nature of what we call God in all its forms. You may balk at the flowery imagery he first describes, but consider it a possible \\"shock easing\\" stage upon death. Even after his miraculous recovery, he and colleagues seek to explain his experience, and all their expertise can come up with is that against all scientific reason, it happened.
0375851569|4.0|Good gift for a new parent.<br /><br />Same cover, etc, as the ones I grew up with. Pass on the memories.
0517543052|5.0|The Dick and Jane for the counterculture generation of the 60's.  Doctor Alpert's transformation from Elite College professor to Ram Dass, spiritual seeker and guide, gave Consciousness study its initial serious investigation and legitimacy.  Today as quantum physics prove conscousness' critical role in determining reality, Be Here Now is neo-relevant, translating sterile Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle into a loving guide for human exploration of the larger reality of existence.
B0019N95IK|5.0|I know everyone dissed Enterprise when it was on, but I fell in love with it and still love it (theme song and all). I'm a huge fan of all the Trek shows, except DS9 (hate the religious, warring, meaningless, stuff). But to me, only the later seasons of STTNG compare to Enteprise. I love the time period and the fact Enterprise shows how we go from today to the Federation.<br />Trip is my favorite character just about of all time followed by T'Pol. Those two made the show for me. Wish it had gone on the full 7 seasons! I have the iTunes 720P versions, but I'm looking forward to seeing double that resolution!
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|simple real time strategy  game.  my son loves it.  started playing and had no questions on how to play.  quite addicting.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm not going to give it away, this is a must read. You won't be let down. I don't think Nicholas Sparks knows how too.
B0091REZMW|5.0|very fun and addictive game. I wake up wanting to play. very fun and time flies when playing.<br />I love it. download and enjoy.
B00867GHS8|5.0|This is one of Disney Pixar's greatest movies!  I was so glad it was re-released in 3D.  This is definitely a movie the whole family can enjoy!
B004Z98B1M|5.0|Great
