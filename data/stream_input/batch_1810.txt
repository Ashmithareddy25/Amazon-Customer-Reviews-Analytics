B00371XIJE|5.0|This is an excellent movie! Love the fact that it is a true story. A bit sad in the end.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|For anyone that has seen the first two seasons of the Walking Dead, they already know that it is one of the best series on TV right now. If you have not seen them then you should do it soon. If you put off by the idea of it being centered on zombies, that is not really true. The real essence of this program is the actors, their amazing skill, their relationships, and the realism of the situation. Too often apocalypse type programs lead the characters into making ridiculous decisions, that any sane person would not. The walking dead is not like that at all, anyone can be hurt or die at any time, which is what you would expect in a zombie apocalypse. Every single episode is action packed and has you on the edge of your seat. My only gripe is that episodes are only once a week!!
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I was unaware of the amount of great hits on this particular album. This album is a must buy for any Credence Clearwater fan!

0756655307|5.0|My 8 yr old son has wanted this book for ages. He spends hours pouring over the pages and memorizing facts about his favorite superheroes and villains. It has awesome graphics and it is easy for him to use.

B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Alternate title: Slut Shaming, a novel<br /><br />Of course the abusive nature of the relationship is extremely problematic but since other reviewers have done such an excellent job expressing disgust and rage about Travis' abuse I decided to focus all of my disgust and rage on this book's effort to promote the dangerous message to women that only men have a right to express themselves sexually.<br /><br />Whether Helen Gurley Brown was a feminist has been debated. She considered herself to be one. Her contribution to women's freedom and sexual liberation isn't debatable. In 1962, she promoted the controversial tenet that sex is a great thing and single women should enjoy it. Sadly, based on the popularity of Beautiful Disaster, its time to republish<br />[[ASIN:B008E724NW Sex and the Single Girl: The Unmarried Woman's Guide to Men (Cult Classics)]]<br /><br />I received an ARC from the publisher through netgalley. This was my feedback to them:<br />I won't recommend this book to anyone unless its to a sociology student looking for examples of the societal marginalization of women by equating female sexuality with lack of intelligence and morality. The main purpose of this book is to perpetuate the idea that women who enjoy sex are bad, stupid people. Publishing this book was irresponsible.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|heard so much about this game.  a little different than i thought  not sure if i am playing it right
B009G78EE2|5.0|Macklemore and Ryan Lewis bring a fresh new sound to hip hop that is also truly lyrical. I would recommend this album to anyone!
0156027321|1.0|As a survivor story, this book is mediocre.  It's a variation on the familiar theme, this time with the survivor being paired with a dangerous animal who he alternately needs and fears.  In a rather obvious metaphor the animal represents the main character coming to terms with his own behavior, savage but necessary in his struggle for survival.  If this was the whole story, if the book was about half as long, and if the writing wasn't so pretentious, I'd actually give it 3 stars for being an ok adventure story.<br /><br />But what really ruins the book isn't the tedious writing, it is the author's childish, ignorant philosophic argument--and main theme of the book--that people should believe in god(s) because religion (any religion!) offers a \\"better story\\" than science.  As several other reviewers have noted, this argument is so vacuous that it should be insulting to both believers and non-believers alike.<br /><br />And yet, the book is immensely popular.  The closest parallel I can think of is \\"50 Shades of Grey,\\" a superficial pornographic book being passed off as mainstream fiction.  \\"Life of Pi\\" is the philosophic equivalent of bad pornography.<br /><br />So why is it so popular?  All I can say is that this fits very well with the data showing that Americans are woefully deficient in critical thinking skills and science education.  The author would no doubt call this \\"dry, yeastless, factuality\\" and tell me that there is a \\"better story\\" to explain his success: God did it, of course.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|Great series, Michael Chiklis is fantastic and all the performers in the series are outstanding. Great stories and very interesting. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.

B009HEJXFS|3.0|Its kind of a letdown being its the first movie in almost 10 years.  It seems like Will Smith was trying to hard to be funny, and kind of came off a bit grumpy.  Tommy Lee Jones has a smaller role here and Josh Brolin does a good job with Agent K, however not really that much chemistry between the two.  Could of and should of been funnier.
B004GVUPFE|5.0|This is just fun, it requires a lot of thought, and reminds me of a chess game. Some parts move only with other parts, some move alone. It is a addictive little game. I have sent it to a few friends to download, I hope they have as much fun as I do.
B0045KCD10|5.0|I rented this version of \\"Miracle On 34th Street\\" to watch on my Roku with my grand-daughter. She is 5 years old and this was the first time she had ever watch it. She found it to be the same as I have always have every single time I've watch it, . .absolute nothing short of wonderful! This is one \\"newer\\" remake of an older classic that I actually believe is better than the original-which I love the original too. If you are going to watch this movie go ahead, spend a little extra and get it in the HD version, you won't be sorry that you did. Anyways, Merry Christmas to one and all, and Happy Holidays.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well written, superb story.  The characters are believable, and the premise makes sense, especially when compared to our planet's current trajectory.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Love me some Taylor Swift, what an awesome song writer and singer, is there nothing she cannot write about and turn into a song?
B000YHG72E|5.0|HI--LA--RI--OUS!<br /><br />An absolute must see Christmas movie. My husband saw this for the first time a couple days ago and was laughing the entire time. I saw this, again, and was still laughing just as hard. So this movie is very fun for adults.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I love this band, the lyrics are so beautiful and the music makes you want to dance, the whold CD is about being ones self and not ashamed to say it.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I pre-ordered off another site and paid $30 more than amazon, but even then found the purchase worth it. I have other copies of some of the other albums and to my moderately trained ear and decent sound system, these do sound marvelous. am not sure where all the negativity is coming from, unless some boxed sets are really defective, but the individually sold albums are getting good reviews so I wonder why the copies in the boxed sets get lower ratings...i would assume these are the same except that they are bundled and boxed. anyway, imho, a must buy.
B000BNWU18|5.0|my professor recommend it. IT is an old book but very useful in college writing which is different from high school
B005HJU7HA|4.0|Think it's great that people are taking their time to archive classics for Kindle, but there are a fair number of typos in this one. Shouldn't be a big deal, but they are like little literary burrs you have to pick out of your socks.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|it slows down device and it is all ways running I rather use my own Bible. just get a bother Bible app.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is a classic romance novel with a story every woman dreams of and a subtle hint of comedy.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is one of the best movies. This has been a great tradition in my family. I can't seem to find my copy. I think maybe one of my girls took my copy, which is fine. The tradition lives on with them. I can't wait to curl up and watch this again. Christmas is not Christmas without this movie. Enjoy!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I hate to give it a 1, when I actually think this would be a great app. Unfortunately it seems to have a bug at the moment. It skips after just a few seconds, on any of the sounds. Now I know the are loops but this is not that. It is a huge pause. I have contacted Amazon and they are looking into the problem. They were very nice and walked me through what they hoped would be a fix, but it wasn't. I hope to re-rate this a 5 when the problem is fixed. But right now I can't give this a negative so it gets a one :(<br /><br />1/17/13<br />I am now changing my star rating to a 5!! :D This is finally a great app! The Amazon people came through with a fix!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is my favorite movie to watch at Christmas time. It has been a tradition to watch this movie with my family at the holidays. I just love it. I can't wait to be a grandma, so I can start the tradition with my grandkids.
B00005614M|5.0|Great addition to the CD collection.  The title of this CD sums it up.<br />I like Miles Davis and I very happy with this selection :)))
0547884591|5.0|Not that I think he ever would, nor would it fit his lifestyle, but there is plenty of waste he would eliminate and focus on the 20% of issues that would generate 80% positive public opinion.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|I've saved those penguins so many times, I'm starting to look like them!<br />I'm super fast through level two, with a big congratulations!  Then I'm back to winter wonderland, but never a level three!  What gives?  Am I missing something?<br />I'd love to give more stars, but with two levels that take about 40 seconds to complete together, not worth it! I could have used that buck for something else!
0525953728|5.0|But it is pretty good account of the raid on bin Laden's compound from the POV of a DEVGRU SEAL who was there.  He also delves into what it took to get to the SEAL teams and DEVGRU.  Fascinating book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|More books have been written about this one Book than any other.  What can I say this Is The Word!

B009RI4FRU|4.0|Saw it at our local art house theatre.  Bought it for my 8 and 11-year-old grandkids for Christmas.  Other than one brief scene, I feel it's age appropriate and the kids will really enjoy it.
B0040GR01M|5.0|I've always liked 3DG & this was an opportunity to purchase the entire album on sale. This album is great & I've always wanted it.<br />Thank you Amazon!
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|The movie was good and it almost stay with orginal movie, except the plot was held on Earth instead of Mars.  It was more action pack than the original movie.
1582701709|5.0|I swear by this book, it sits on my desk at all times. It's a must have, I highly recommend it.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|This application is great for you're kindle.  It works well and hasn't given me any issues.  Would recommend if you are intrested in learn more things.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I enjoyed this enough to order and read the second book in the series!  Both books were fun to read.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|This was not as good as the first two. Yes, Batman has another big toy. And, yes, it's kind of cool. But the overall plot development in this movie moves slowly. You don't end the movie out of breath like in the first two.
0486290492|4.0|It was a little on the cheap side which i expected a couple of pages where actually tore a little bit but over all nice book.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|One of the best apps for Mahjong! If you don't have it and love puzzle games, this one is a must!

B0000AUHOH|5.0|this dvd movie is awesome, it really a good movie, to watch, I would recomend this dvd yo my friends.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|This movie has pretty cool action and a good story. The best thing is the way Lincoln swings and flips his axe around. I wanted to try it with my axe but wife yelled at me.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Fun game and will keep u busy for hours on end very challenging and well worth the money and the time spent on playing it!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a very typical Nichalas Sparks.  I would rank it among his top three.  The theme of spousal abuse is current and relevant.  Character development is very good and the twist at the end is a welcome break from the usual Sparks.
B006N38104|5.0|SEAL took classic songs and sang them in such a way, you felt like he was the original artist. I played this CD while on a 3 1/2 hour road trip. I fell in love with SEAL's voice. I love his kind of huskiness.
B007QUUIEA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - it has many of the coming-of-age cliches but with intruiguing and unique aspects, which kept it warm and amusing.  Awesome.
1881273873|4.0|I purchased this book for our single's ministry group. We are learnig a lot from this book. I suggest anyone that is single and looking to date and want to make good dating decisions to read this book.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|I laughed and cried - excellent insight into the highs and lows of young people with terminal illness.  A special book.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Awesome show! It kept me on the edge o my seat during the first two episodes. Definitely dark and twisty adventure fir adults. I wouldn't let my kids watch.
B00594M53M|5.0|Watching this movie humbled me in a beautiful way........you never know how lucky you are until you meet an obstacle like the one facing the main character........this movie was so full of good love, true love, profound insights and much, much more....not just about the main character, but each separate character's story was outstanding....It was WONDERFUL!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Great new album by Van Morrison. You never get tired of listening to Van Morrison. No doubt he was born to sing.
B009329ZF2|4.0|While this film was not what I expected, it was enjoyable nonetheless.  It was good enough to rent after first seeing it in the theatre.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|A sultry voice; excellent piano playing; a beautiful lady. What more could you ask for? Diana Krall's latest release is excellent as always.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie! It was a must have to add to out Christmas movie collection. Tom hanks does a great job being the conductor. This movie will be watched many many times!
B009K45Y62|4.0|This is a great end to this series.  Nolan took Batman to a whole new level.  The blu ray looks crystal clear and the special features are great.  Must have for any Batman fan!
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Denzel is so good in this movie.  It's action packed.  I don't care too much the way it ended though.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|THIS MOVIE DID NOT INSULT MY INTELLIGENCE AND THIS MOVIE PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE INTERESTING TO ANYONE UNDER 50.  IT WAS GREAT FOR ME BECAUSE I COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CHARACTERS WERE GOING THROUGH.  THE ACTING IS WONDERFUL.  THE STORY IS SIMPLE, MAYBE A LITTLE TOO SIMPLE BUT THE MOVIE IS FUN.
B00881PPTO|5.0|I use Kayak (mobile and pc) all the time when planning trips - mostly for air travel.  Works great - and easy to set up searches!
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|As much as I love Jamie Fraser this book was not as good as the others. These poor people go through so much ALL the time and it never ends. They can't catch a break. I like adventure, angst, and all that but this is ridiculous. But I'm addicted and can't stop reading them.<br /><br />There was one whole plot I could have done without, which was the whole Roger getting sold to the Indians and Ian getting taken away. The Roger thing was unnecessary and frustrating, but the Ian thing was heartbreaking.<br /><br />I have the 5th book loaded on my iPhone already but I'm not sure if I'm ready to begin it or if I need a break for a while. And I see the next one is 10 hours longer than this one.<br /><br />I think the only thing that keeps me going during the lull parts is Davina and her wonderful narrating skills. She keeps me in the game and hanging on when I wish I was reading an actual book and could skim. During this book I wanted to skim a lot and unfortunately because of the audiobook I couldn't.<br /><br />I want to continue out of pure curiosity but I'm sort of dreading the next one. Not a good sign. However, I bought all of the books already so I'll have to read them sometime!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Unbelievable information to read about and so sad.  I have not put time into learning about North Korea and am now aware of what that country is living through.  I appreciate the tenacity of the main character and his struggle in finding joy even when he is out of Camp 14.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|Amazing series. I am in such love with these books and can't stop. Yes, there are parts I wish I could skim over as they are redundant, but I love the books nonetheless.<br /><br />If you love Highlander/time travel/historical books then this series is for you.<br /><br />I think I'm a bit late on this band wagon, but oh so glad I've found them.
0061537969|5.0|I love dogs and I enjoyed this book.  It was difficult to put down.  I am passing it on to others to read.
0525952926|4.0|I eagerly awaited the release of \\"Winter\\" after thoroughly enjoying \\"Fall of Giants\\" and nearly every other Follett novel.<br /><br />Though not as good as the first novel, it's still a must read and an engrossing story full of facts we didn't know.  I know that none of the main characters from the first book was Jewish but to completely leave out the Holocaust from any character perspective was something only Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would be content with.  The Jewish Doctor Issac Rothman goes voluntarily to a death camp and is never heard from again.  His wife Hannelore (not Jewish) is viewed in a camp but only on the day of the Russian occupation.  Anyone reading this book could certainly conclude the Holocaust never happened or that Follett doesn't believe it's important in any way to the story of WWII.<br /><br />You may think there's been enough written about this Holocaust already but that would be true of Pearl Harbor, The battle of the Midway, D-Day or any other well documented events this novel delves into.<br /><br />Eva, the daughter of Issac and Hannelore hardly seems interested in what happened to her parents, though she's a major secondary character.<br /><br />The Maud and Ethel from the first book are middle aged now, but don't seem to resemble their younger characters whom I found to be vibrant and heroic.  Later in the book, we see a bit of the Ethel we came to know.<br /><br />The central characters of Lloyd Williams, Carla Von Ulrich, and Daisy Peshkov are well developed and interesting.  Lev Peshkov makes an appearance at the beginning of the novel but is mostly absent from the book although it would seem he's a major political influence on world events..<br /><br />Earl Fitzherbert lacks all the the depth he had in the first novel and is relegated to a one-dimensional caricature of his former self.<br /><br />I could go on, character by character but no need.  The first novel was much better but this is still a great book and a great story.<br /><br />Enjoy!!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|For decades I have relied on 'experts' to inform me about eating properly without ever verifying their statements or assumptions. Thirty plus pounds later, Gary Taubes &#34;Why We Get Fat&#34; asserted a point of view directly at odds with those of the respected authorities, and backed it up with the research upon which it was based. What alarms me is that it has taken epidemic levels of obesity and diabetes to counter the misinformation disseminated by respected individuals and institutions. Much of the research he sites has been around for a long while, yet it was ignored because it didn't agree with what the experts 'knew'.
B007EW9ISM|2.0|This item is too short to be effective and a little to heavy. The diameter is good, but at $25 this purchase wasn't worth it and not what i expected

B00004XQ83|5.0|fantastic movie and the music is great  given as a gift for family to enjoy  many thanksWe already have our own that is enjoyed all the time.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Our whole family sat down to watch this movie. I usually find something else to do while the rest of them watch animated movies, but I actually watched the whole thing this time.
0061122416|5.0|Had to get this for my class and I learned many things from this book. I recommend this book to anyone really.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I heard &#34;Tessellate&#34; while on a road trip with friends and immediately knew I wanted to hear more of what Alt-J had to offer. The whole album is fantastic! The other songs are not strictly similar to Tessellate but it flows well and has a great sound; different songs for different moods.
B009JBZH54|1.0|My set only included 4 discs. There, where The Dark Knight Rises movie disc was supposed to be sat a big empty disc holder. This is a bit silly considering how big a company warner brothers is >.<
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love this show! It has a lot of suspense and action. I love shows that have woman kicking rear. I have 3 of my neighbors hooked on the show as well and they can't wait to see what happens to Victoria! lol
B007HACDLK|5.0|Excellent read.  Enough said.  And it doesn't look like Mitch is getting old.  I was afraid that after the head trauma, he would turn into a liberal.  Don't worry, he didn't.
B004YRSBTW|5.0|Guy Pearce is so great in this movie.  It is a movie that keeps you intrigued all the way through.  By the director of Inception.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Not just a kids game, My husband and I love playing it with our children. The rules are very simple but the game is always interesting and engaging as new strategies emerge and are countered. I have bought this game for all my nieces and nephews and grandparents as well. I would recommend this game to anyone over the age of 5. A slightly negative note- Do Not loose a single piece of this game. Each person has 21 pieces and must have them to play.  We always count ours when we put it away to be sure they are all there.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|N. Sparks is my favorite author, so I know what to expect in his books.  I enjoyed the struggles and emotions with the Characters.
B008ENNXQI|5.0|Great movie.  Different spin on the story as compared to Snw White & the Huntsman.  Definitely a must see.  Julia Roberts does a fantastic performance.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Fantastic Film and story excellent the best batman and great collection<br />the blu ray is excellent, I Love This Movie.
B008578PMU|4.0|The movie was excellent in always.  Action packed but also gave a good perspective on the Negro part of the US Air force squadron in WW11.  We all really enjoyed the dog fights.
034580404X|5.0|My wife loved it. It's a great book for women to read. If your wife likes reading books I recommend you give her this one.
B002VX0A40|4.0|my daughter is 6 months old.. we've had this a few months.. she liked him, but mainly only chewed on his mirror tail.. We also have the Moose by this same company...she LOVED the Moose. And I have 2 friends who bought the moose and their babies love too!! Get him if he's available!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|THIS BOOK WILL BECOME AN INSTANT CLASSIC FOR ALL WHO READ IT, THOUGH I WOULD NOT SUGGEST IT FOR ANYONE NOT YET IN AT LEAST MIDDLE SCHOOL.
B00979CS50|5.0|Neil Young still has it.  The tracks on this CD are long and show Neil and Crazy Horse at their best.  First song is 38 minutes. (that's not a typo). 38.  Saw them on the last leg of their tour in Bridgeport CT...awesome.  Neil Young has not burned out or faded away!
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|You will not get a digital copy of the movie Ultraviolet with this DVD purchase, which is what I thought I was going to get. Apparently, UltraViolet is their term for getting a digital copy of the DVD you just bought. Why anyone would want that I haven't a clue. So, yes, you will get a digital copy of Underworld: Awakening, but not a digital copy of the movie Ultraviolet. Buyer beware.
1451695195|4.0|We haven't finished the book yet, but so far it is very interesting.  We are Christians, and are looking for ways to encourage people to accept Christ and the life beyond.  This book may be a good tool to use in this goal.  Faye Wilkerson
B000EGF0NW|4.0|How can I say I love a book that is about recovery from rape?  This riveting true story is not so much about the horror of the experience, but the recovery from it.  Most revealing is how her friends and family responded to her after she became a rape victim.  Insightful.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|A little slow and plodding, but a relevant story. Many older couples will find this compelling. Well acted. I was surprised by the serious role by Steve Correll.
0143118420|3.0|I'm a conservative Christian, but pretty open-minded so I was intrigued by the spiritual possibilities of this book.  Elizabeth Gilbert asks all the right questions, but, unfortunately, finds all the wrong answers.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Not as good as the first 2 of iron man but worth the money. The scenes are awesome and the soundtrack rocks
B005XN2ZUC|5.0|I purchased this the day before the first episode was aired to see if I wanted my 12-year-old daughter to see it or not.  It's a winner!  We are hooked on this series (it is now in season 2) and I will probably purchase a hard copy of the DVD set to have in our collection.  Full of fairy tale romance with a hint or reality, it is a wonderful fairy-tale ride that I recommend highly for the whole family!
0205313426|5.0|This books gives great examples and information about each rule! It is a great \\"go to\\" book for writing and verification!
0545265355|5.0|My daughter (12) started reading this series and once I discovered that is was supposedly about kids killing each other in an arena in a dystopian future, I thought I'd better read it before I left her go on in the series.  Anyone who thinks it's about child gladiators is missing the entire point of the series.  A jibe at self-centered, wasteful Americans (aka: the Capitol citizens), this book is about courage and real love.  The characters are multi-dimensional, the plot twists and turns satisfyingly and the message is full of wisdom.  Highly recommend for mature tweens and older.
0316017922|4.0|This is a very good book it gives a different perspective on the successful people's lives. How they succeeded in life is it only due to their ability or they were purely lucky. The author seems to have picked the examples that reiterate his idea. What about others? there are so many people who have been successful?
6303314015|5.0|such a fun movie, full of thrills and action. we all love baby animals and this one is perfect for a childs inquisitive mind.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|I've always been an Arnold fan and a bit of a bodybuilding fan so this book got my interest up. I'm not quite half through it yet but so far it has kept me wanting more. This man has lived a very interesting and fun life, been very successful and inspirational to many so it has been a joy to read about it all.
6302642248|5.0|well kids will get the message about not being truthful and also about family love.. no matter how different the child. love it..

B0071MQBX0|5.0|I have seen the live performance of this opera.  It was stunning then.  This video is a wonderful memory of what I saw.  The music and the songs are masterfully done.  The end features Andrew Lloyd Webber which was even more exciting to see.
B004YXE438|5.0|Love the fact that I can choose the puzzle size and difficulty.  Great fun. Grand kids enjoy it a great deal.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love , love , love this show! It is mos def. in my top 5 best shows of all time. Everything about it is on point and i'm usually biting my nails waiting for the next episode to appear lol I've been addicted from season 1 episode 1. Everyone around me is addicted too. My mother usually don't like things about zombies and refused to watch it for the longest time. She would ask why do you like that? the whole zombie thing is corny, until she watched like 5 minutes of an episode I was watching and was hooked lol, she went back to the beginning watching season 1 and worked her way up now we are both longing for the next episode. TRUST ME IT IS SOOOOOOOOOO WORTH IT !
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|The kindle version of this classic is easy to read and has great parts already highlighted. I have enjoyed re-reading it and recommend it to everyone.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|It's sad but, the &#34;hell with it&#34; I'm gonna die action is soo much fun! Every season I just want to hug Sam. This was one of them!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|This book was gruesome and poorly written.  The beginning hooks you in with promises of a new found belief in god from the man's story.  What the heck?  I must've missed where that epiphany comes to be.  If the movie is ANYTHING like the book (normally not the case as we all know) I don't know why anyone would want to watch it.  Eww!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Started and ended sad but, way too much fun in between! Poor Sam! Sat on the edge of my seat waiting for season 5 to start the next fall. Luv Supernatural!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Josh Brolin really nailed the character of young K!  If you like the MIB movies, you will not be disappointed in this one.
B0000X2DMA|5.0|I found out about thier music on youtube. Took a while to find out which cd I was looking for but, of course Amazon had it. And at a great price! Luv the music! Heavy rock with opera  sounds amazing!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game its so fun. :)  ;)  :D I like all the dragons :) I all so like the people that play this game they are so nice.  :)
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Had to get season 5. It's so sad. Love Sam & Dean ! the heartbreaking, world saving choices they make!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|the sounds for sleeping is helpful for me to sleep when I have rough nights. Nothing else can seem to help me but with Relax Melodies my night gets better
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book gave me some much needed back story on the Spartan program and the Master Chief. Enjoyed the read.
0547884591|5.0|Love the book for it's randomness.  Thank goodness it's not just a cookbook.... my collection of over 30 cookbooks is currently collecting dust as I usually just google recipes, last minute.<br />It's not a book that you should read page by page but just flip it open and  find something new!  Love the color and the photos!!<br />I am super glad I got the actual book and not on a kindle.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Fascinating in so many ways.  Shows the power of knowledge, strength, ingenuity and faith working together with survival as the ultimate goal.  A beautiful story for readers young and old.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This is a great Christmas film!  It has a lot of humor for the adults and kids will enjoy it as well.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I really like listening to Taylor, she is a young, stylish<br />lady of the ages, her songs are story like that I<br />think both young and old can relate to...pg
142311339X|5.0|This book is one of Rick Riordan's best! It's funny, longer than the Percy Jackson books (Which is good), and all out awesome! That's it really. Oh yeah! READ IT!!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This a awesome movie for young adults and kids, I have gotten this movie for my grandkids, I know they will like it as much as I did!
0802130208|5.0|I read this great book years ago and only just realized that my husband has never ventured into the rich world of Ignatius.  Everyone needs to know and love him.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a wonderful game.  It is very difficult to stop playing it when I have to!!<br />It exercises a part of the brain that most other games do not!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Both brought action into the movie..Robin is coming back too! Hated the villains and loved the good guys! Great Movie.
B00846REIS|3.0|I liked this novel because it's steamy like 50 shades, however, it's JUST like it. Look at the initials even: Christian Grey VS Gideon Cross?? Would like it if it were more original, but still an entertaining read.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Its was a fun family movie. Not the best from Pixar, but definetly not the worst either. I recommend it!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I took me awhile to get into the Hunger Games. Mostly since I read James Patterson and romance novels, so going to teen fiction was a bit of a transition, but there was so much buzz around it, I gave it a shot. Turns out once I got through book 1, I was dying to read books 2 and 3. Once I was hooked, I wanted to continue reading, it just took awhile to get there.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|It's not as bad as the second one, but not as good and entertaining as the first. I wouldn't recomend it, unless you really have nothing else to do. Will Smith was funny as usual, and Jones was alright, he was barely there. I would've like to see more of Josh Brolin. Special effects where ok...
B008XG1X18|5.0|My main computer got infected terrible and so I had to use this on my kindle. It worked better than on my computer! LOVE this site! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and I play this game everyday even at work as well at home. Its fun, its exciting, and I play this game with my family and friends. Its easy to play I play this game to keep me focus, on point, to relax, when I have the time and to get away from the maddness. Love the game.
B001AKTZO6|5.0|The sound quality is clear and very well mastered! I was impressed by all of the track selections. This Album is money well spent! They include some songs I have never heard before. But the clarity and quality is amazing. If you are a fan of all forms of music and truly appreciate the art of music, to include vintage; meaning old music, and the cultural diversity of music, and how some of it can truly open the door to your heart and soul…well then you will love this material.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|WARNING - ALL SPOILERS.<br />I really love the idea of a humanity confined to a few silos. However the specifics of the plot leave much to be desired in terms of completeness and rationale. For example, I don't get why Mechanics went from submission to outright armed conflict, and even less so why Supply joined. Also I don't get why Bernard (head of IT and mayor) who seems to be super bright, responded with brute force. There are many other such examples throughout the first 5 books.<br />The writing is the other part that I am not so keen on. It's simple simple simple... I guess I'm used to more sophisticated and mature writers.<br />Bottom line it's a fun read. Easy on the brain and engaging (if you can ignore the faults).
B007I1QUYE|5.0|The Tobey Maguire versions of Spider-man are well done. Spider-man 1, 2 and 3 are all absolutely superb. The story line, cinematography, CGI effects, and acting are all stunning and well done. This is A-List level movie production at its finest. Money well spent. These versions of Spider-man are much better than the \\"Amazing Spider-man 2012\\", this latest version is a mess and is absolutely horrible...that's why I bought the Tobey Maguire-versions, so I could see a real Spider-man movie done right!
B009329Y30|4.0|for the life of me I can not understand why Amazon insists we bore others with a long winded review. Looking at previous reviews, I agree with most of them.  I loved this movie and thought the characters were well played and I enjoyed it.
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|this movie was good from beginning to end.excellent.i want to watch it again.we need more made like this movie.i love action movies.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|This is not only a guide of how to train your brain, but more a romance that inside you can find techniques of how to do it.<br />The author creates a context for each technique showing what are the forces that move him to start training a specific technique. This is importante because sometimes you will feel in same frustation and find the same difficult move on to the next step.<br />All this tools and artificies create a more interest narrative and keep the reader's attention, what create a empathy with the author ( which is the main character of the book ). On the end you will be reproducing, even in a simple way, all the brain training techniques just following the journey of the author.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Sylvester stallone was good as expected.all star cast.i loved tihe action.this movie was better than the first movie.better cast&plot..lots more action
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This is a great book. It gives you great insite to how people in other countries live. It also shows how true geinus works. This book should be required reading for all high school freshmen.
B002RT69QQ|4.0|I used these for a year or so, but I finally moved past its capacity in SD Size, it doesn't to the high density cards, like above 16 gb
B009LUCPWQ|4.0|I have loved Graham Parkers music for years. Graham Parker and The Rumor, started it all. What a pleasure to heart hem all together again. Beautiful music, beautiful album. Keep it up!

0979019710|5.0|I am really glad that Hal felt led to put his morning \\"routine\\" in book form. I am NOT a morning person. The great thing about the Miracle Morning is that not only for a type of person; it's for everyone. I never thought I could do mornings and my manager tried it and told me to try it for a day. I tried it and couldn't believe how awesome my day was. This book is easy to understand. Its easy to execute. It is an all around awesome way to transform your life... all before 8am.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|Well packaged, shipped quickly, good quality product arrived working and undamaged, reasonable price. Things just don't get any better than that! Thanks, and a pleasure doing business with you.
0345803507|2.0|With a twitchy palm I run my hands through my hair for that \\"just f..ed look\\" Holy cow! My subconscious flushes, bites her lip and  gasps while my inner goddess rolls her eyes and with a smirk and rugged breath  artfully drapes herself over every available piece of furniture , including the bathroom commode (hey, this is MY inner goddess!!!). Jeez, why am I still reading this? Let's count it down:<br />1. I REALLY wanted to find out what all the hoopla is all about<br />2. I REALLY do hate not finishing what I have started<br />3. The set was a gift and it would be rude of me not to give it all of the appreciation (thank you baby)<br />4. I really do like the artwork on the book covers<br />5. Out of curiosity, I have followed some of the music references and some of the pieces are really lovely - unexpected bonus!<br />6. Besides the obvious parallel to Twilight I am interested to find out how many other ideas the writer have pilfered e.g. from Jerry McGuire \\"You had me at I DO..., at meadows... and several other locations. And then there are others (Tomas Crown Affair with Pierce Bronson anyone? The millionaire sails catamaran and pilots the glider).<br />  I had actually enjoyed the e-mail exchange; everything else is a triple crap!<br /><br />  I giggle and turn 50 shades of purple from the suppressed laughter!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|simple to use &amp; works great; doesn't drain battery; wakes kindle from sleep mode.  choice of tones; white noise player; sleep timer all included in free version.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|when I saw I thought it would be horrible but no it was awesome,fun,and cool if you played it you would think its cool to I promise
B00138CYD4|5.0|All the great old time and new hits with Carlos Santana. There's even 1 cut with Tina Turner. It does not get better than this. Just turn it up all the way.
B002GIBVW0|5.0|If anyone gives this movie a bad review I'm thinking they might want to take another look at it. It's a film about a great dane that kind of talks, his hippy pal shag, and a bunch of wannabe ghost chasing 70s throwbacks. It's based on kids t.v. show that I loved when I was a kid so when I sat down to watch this film I got what I expected. Stupid, sappy, slapsticky , dumb FUN. Was it funny? Sort of.Was it fun? Yes. Ghosts and monsters and all the things that go with scooby doo. Violent? Are you kidding? Would I recommend this to kids? Sure, even though they would probably lose interest because nobody is carrying a gun or killing aliens. Sure it's stupid. It's SCOOBY DOO!!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!! So relax and get over yourself...........
B006GECE9Y|3.0|I had a reccomendation that I would be able to use this to see Amazon instant video on my phone (T-Mobile G2). It did not work for that. I removed the browser.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I read this book twice in one day. It's a really interesting discussion on the nature of art and on understanding one's self and other people. The characters were such real people even though we didn't see them all for very long. As usual, Sanderson's magic is very consistent, which I also appreciated.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|.... hopefully leaving a review will stop the pop up every morning.  Not really what I want to do first thing in the morning.  Or see.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|This is a very enjoyable disc. The sound quality is super and the video crystal clear. The talent of the artists is inmeasurable. It might say not-rated but it is PG-13 no doubt. Some of the lyrics are not family friendly. Too bad one of the great classics of all time. Otherwise it was 5 star all the way.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|It's rough being a black man.  Federal prisons are not the country clubs they're cracked up to be.  And almost halfway through the book, I was wondering if the plot would ever get started.  Not my idea of fun.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|George Martin is an excellent story teller.  There are no dips in the forward motion of his narratives.  I am glad there are so many books in this series!
B008PZ69Q6|2.0|I bought \\"Prince From Another Planet\\"; and received the 2CD Legacy Edition of MSG for a gift, so I kept it.  My CD player has two trays and visible audio levels, so I wanted to compare the two releases thinking they would be the same.  The first thing I noticed was \\"Prince\\"; has 25 tracks reading 60:45, and \\"As Recorded at MSG\\"; only has 24 reading 60:50, even though the packaging says 25 tracks.  The mastering/audio levels are completely different!!  The 2CD \\"Legacy\\" versions sound old and muffled compared to the truly remastered \\"Prince From Another Planet\\" deluxe package and that's only by ear.  \\"Prince\\"'s levels go into the red and sounds like a modern recording, whereas the \\"MSG Legacy Edition\\" sounds poorly mastered from the 80s.<br /><br />That said, it seems the 2CD MSG Legacy version's mastering is the same as the 1997 releases and they are merely being repackaged together with no improvement in sound quality!!<br /><br />Go ahead and get the Prince from Another Planet and avoid the 2CD version, even  though there is no place to permanently keep the discs with your other jewel cases...this is one reason I decided to keep the 2CD gift copy.  Why not just make a slightly fatter \\"Legacy Edition\\" in order to fit the DVD which is included in the deluxe \\"Prince\\" package?
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My daughter cannot get enough of this game. Graphics are good and the game is challenging. This is just what I expected.
B0082RHRHC|1.0|Oh, how Jane Eyre was such a boring read!  But, of course, I've never been a little girl, the target audience for this story.  It reads like a diary, without the \\"Dear diary, ...\\" part a nd covers Jane's life - as imagined by young Charlotte.  I only read it for a literature class.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|One of my favorite rock albums or albums all together, They have real fast paced beats that match the energy from the singer, and lyrics that are deep and angry but don't make you to just listen and like the music because it is good. There are no bad songs on this album to me probably no songs that you could get tired of, but in case have more than one album.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It is as the critics described it-typical, Picoult ,and giving much food for thought about teenagers relationships and family /parents -a frightning  thought-how well does one really know your kids and their daily thoughts about life and relationships ? One can never be too close to your child  -specially with a hectic lifestyle -make time for each other and listen to your familymembers -not only with your ears but eyes and heart as well..
B00008H2LB|5.0|Gave this five stars cause to me if you have at least nine tracks that are great it complete, and there are nine tracks that are.
0440245206|3.0|I love Danielle Steel but this book seemed to go on forever.  The last 50 pages or so I just skimmed through them.
0810989956|5.0|My 7 year old son was obsessed with filling out this entire book.  We had to MAKE him put it down to do anything else!  He loves the book series and this one was even more fun for him.  I highly recommend!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|it was fun, but stupid. i was glad to see a real hero, portrayed as a hero. We need a Lincoln now.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love the way that the graphics are.  and the pets are so cute . my favorite animal is well.... I don't have a favorite.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Love this movie! Makes me laugh every time! I've seen it a thousand times and its still super funny! Love it!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Though it would be funny but was mostly depressing.  Got tired of Tommy's incessant grumpiness. Streep was good as usual.
B006H8BIIM|5.0|Purchased this game when i first got my fire, one year later and i am still playing it on a regular basis. No need to spend real money,  just play survival on very hard and crank game speed to max and set the game down. You will earn 250-300 credits everytime. In less than an hour and a half you will have enough credits to buy everything. :)
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Too many dumb one-liners. Overacting. I didn't care about the characters. Villan was hard to understand. Too much reliance upon special effects rather than developing characters and plot.
B0040JHNZ2|5.0|A truly epic work covering a turbulent period as seen through the strangely intertwined lives of 4 very different families. I can hardly wait for the next two volumes
B004HW7JH4|5.0|One of my favorite television shows on TV right now. Can't wait to catch up and watch this season through.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|a magnificent novel from one of the best authors of his era. The type of book that you cannot put down- book a comfortable chair, lose the phone, close the blinds and settle down to be entertained and excited
B004HY3BTC|5.0|I enjoyed the first Short Circuit movie very much, but this one blows the original away. I must have watched this a thousand times as a kid (I wore out a VHS copy of it) and was thrilled to get it on blu ray. This is a great family comedy that everyone will enjoy.
B003GK22D4|5.0|An absolutely magnificent novel spanning many years covering the development of a master spy.<br />A very sensitively treated storyline which is both believable and truly memorable. Very hard to fault
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|Best. Advent. Calendar. Ever.<br /><br />Have a Lego fan in your house who also enjoys Star Wars? Buy them this. I'm 32 years old and I can't wait to get up each day and open the little door and see what today's model is.<br /><br />My only gripe is price. $40 seems a tad high for what basically amounts to a less than 250 piece kit.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|A truly magnificent story which details the experiences of 4 families on the turbulent middle part of the 20th Century. I can hardly wait for volume 3
B0053O89KG|4.0|The plots were innovative,visually enriching,intelligent and humorous script and i have already started recommending to others.<br />If more key characters could be brought in it will feel more closer to a department of investigation.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Must watch.  5 Stars.  I came.<br /><br />Won't let me submit unless I type 14 more words.  I think this should do it ....
B000L3CHC0|2.0|where's the warranty card? I received my watches but there is no warranty card, only the customer support card that SAYS there is supposed to be a warranty card inside. I know that we at least get a manufacturer's warranty along with all products so I'm confused. The box was not sealed so something seems fishy here.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Reusable stickers, what a great idea! Nice job Melissa and Doug. No more getting stickers off of things that they don't belong on!
1452101248|5.0|I have to confess that I bought this book by mistake ... I did no realize at that time that it was 100% vegetable/meat free recipes until I received it, but once I started reading it I found lots of things I wanted to try right away !
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Read it, you'll love it! Follett, Clancy & Flynn research well and present the story as accurately as possible .... sometimes it's scary!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I highly recommend this book.  You will be guessing the entire time and VERY interesting twists and turns, just when you have an &#34;A-HA&#34; moment, turn the page and you'll be back to guessing again!
B00008BXJ6|5.0|What can I say, my hubby loves this band! I received the item on time, and in perfect condition. Wish I didn't have to listen to it, LOL.

6305428042|4.0|My mother is from Salem, MA and wanted to watch this movie with my kids - ages 8 & 10 and they loved it and talked about it for weeks after they saw it.
B005F265GQ|5.0|Great movie, don't be misled by those who gave it bad reviews. Yes, it's not the TV series, but its still a good movie with lots of action, humor and special effects. Its too bad they couldnt get Robert Conrad for at least a cameo, however we still have the old TV series, as well as the made-for-TV specials they have, to see him as James West. I feel that this should have a sequel...perhaps now that they've revisited Men in Black, maybe they'll give us More Wild, Wild West? PS the bluray transfer was great!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My son 10, read this is school and requested that we purcahse it so that he could read it again.  He actually read it to his younger brother and they both enjoyed it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a fun game to play on road trips because it is a time wasting game that is hard to stop playing

0439023491|5.0|------THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS OF THE FIRST HUNGER GAMES BOOK------<br /><br />The original Hunger Games was one of my favorite books of all time. The brilliant use of dialogue and character development kept me wanting to turn the page. I know many people LOVED the first Hunger Games and I am sure that you will feel the same way about Catching Fire.<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br />Catching Fire starts right were the first book ended. Katniss and Peeta were saved from the Hunger Games by pretending they were in love. Their pretend relationship then turned into something much more. Now Katniss has to deal with the complication of having feelings for both Gale(Her long time friend) and Peeta. Having two victors in the Hunger Games sparked a fire. A fire that would soon escalate into the rebellion against President Snow and the corrupt government known as the Capitol.<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br />As always, Suzanne Collins does a brilliant job portraying all the characters throughout the entire book, especially Katniss. Along her journey Katniss meets new characters both old and young. The reason that I find the characters so entertaining is because Collins describes them in such a way that after reading about them, you feel like you know them. I haven't felt this touched by characters since the Harry Potter books. Among my favorite characters are Haymitch, who makes an expected return, Finnick O Dair, a new character with a mysterious personality who appears a little later in the book, and of course Katniss. I felt like Katniss was one of the strongest because she is at a point in the story where there is so much going on in her life (Uprising,Quell,Relationship)that her true character comes out and you can read about whats going in her head. I felt like the characters were represented perfect in Catching Fire.<br /><br />PLOT<br />I want to keep this section brief in order to prevent any major spoilers. Just know that the story to this book is unprecedented. I have read very few books that kept me on the edge of my seat like Catching Fire. The action scenes are intense and brutal as expected. Once you think things start to settle down you are hit with an amazing plot twist that blows your mind. One thing worth mentioning is that the first 50 pages or so start out quite slow but it picks up fairly fast. I have seen people complain and say the ending is lackluster but I thought it was a brilliant way to get people excited for the third book.<br /><br />OVERALL REVIEW<br />I feel like Catching Fire is a good read for ALL ages and genders. This is satisfying book that has the best of everything. Action,suspense,drama,romance. You will not be dissapointed.very few books that kept me on the edge of my seat like Catching Fire.

B0071LLHGC|5.0|I already had this recording on a bootleg, so I was familiar with the content. The import sharpens the sound a bit, so I was happy about that. This is a snapshot of the original ABB at their peak. Duane's spontaneous decision to pay tribute to his good friend, the late, great King Curtis, by including &#34;Soul Serenade&#34; is very poignant. This is an excellent performance.
B0098VXE50|5.0|Charlize Theron rocks. This is a fairy tale for grown ups. The movie is fast paced, and the visual effects are great.
B009DT98RK|5.0|I've probably seen Peter Frampton perform live six or seven times.  His show in Milwaukee is one of his best.  Try as he might, his first big solo album will always be his career highpoint.  He defined rock improvisation in the 70s' with Humble Pie as well as FCA (the original).  Worth seeing again and again.
B008AT71WI|5.0|Long time fan of this movie. Have had the DVD since it first came out , but to get the blu-ray  with the original ending has made me a very happy individual.
B009KKLQVS|2.0|Frankly, the fun, fun, fun is pretty much gone.  There was little magic in this performance.  Granted, the years have gone by for them but the songs were played at a much slower tempo.  There wasn't much enthusiasm in their performance.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Battery HD Pro is fantastic and very informative, I can't believe all the different pieces of information that's available......thanks for a great app.<br /><br />I
B009GESJH2|3.0|Although there are few good cuts on this CD most of them are mediocre at best.  A little disappointing as I enjoyed much of his earlier work.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|I think the historical research in all Ken Follett's books is exceptional.  I am sorry he didn't mention  a little about Australia's participation in the Pacific War e.g. the bombing of Darwin, as many, if not more lives were lost there as in Pearl Harbour.
B009IQG5LK|2.0|I love this movie, and I would have loved if it got a decent Blu-ray release...but sadly, the transfer is far from top-notch, and there are ZERO bonus material on the disc (unless you count a handful of trailers as \\"bonuses\\").  This, no doubt, has more to do with Warren Beatty (who owns the property) than DISNEY (who released the Blu-ray), as DISNEY is usually quite good about providing a good transfer and great bonus materials.  Save your money and catch it on cable sometime.  The video quality will be just as good, and you'll have saved $20.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Really good effects and why does this require 17 words holy cow, it was a great movie, how many times do you have to day that
B007MDB548|5.0|Found this for a gift. Best price around and arrived well before arrival date. Awesome!!!  Product was sealed and not damaged at all. Arrived exactly as described.
159420411X|5.0|I found Nate Silver's ability to not only explain but engage the reader fascinating. Perfect for the curious layperson who wants to know more about some intricate ways of seeing the world around us.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was hard too put down!!  The first person account is mesmerizing and breath taking.  I felt a renewed sense of patriotism and thankfulness for men like these after I finished the book.  God bless them!
1449410243|5.0|Perfect for cat haters or lovers. Or adults that read comics. I especially like the fold out poster, although I know the age 50+ people I'm giving it to won't use it. It's the thought that counts.<br /><br />It has pretty much all of his cat themed comics as well as the title... one... thingy. Go Bob cats!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I thought the book was very insightful enjoyed reading it. In fact I have read it twice and gave it out as a gift.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|great for the family to watch... very touching great story line and great movie all together. i would love to have my daughter who is 3 watch this movie...
B008MM9630|4.0|great game. wish gems were a little easier to come across. and cant understand how to make a few things ive looked online for help and cant find anything that will help me make little flasks. very depressing. but enjoy the game :)
B000W94FE6|5.0|This is as contemporary as ever. Should be mandatory reading in so many institutions and for every single individual embarked on /  interested  in  any form of self development.
B008X8QCTO|1.0|I played other games by this manufacturer and never had a problem. I loved Stray Souls &amp; I highly recommend it! But, when I downloaded this game and paid the .99, it tries to make you pay another fee to finding the rest of the game when you are already halfway through it!! VERY disappointed. REFUND PLEASE. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
B0060D0XE4|5.0|I was in the mood for something cute and possibly a little stupid, but watching it was impressed. It was cute, but not stupid like I thought it would be. I had fun watching this movie.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Kind of a hybrid murder mystery with sci fi angle....<br />A little slow to get going but once about 3/4 of the way through it got to where I really wanted to finish it...good ending and I enjoy the authors detail oriented style.
B00004U2GH|5.0|I'm not a music collector, per se, but like Johnny Cash music.  This collection is fun to listen to, with songs written for this concert and a song written by a San Quentin inmate.  If you like Johnny Cash, this is a must for your collection.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great and fun lots of fun not like original but really cool alright I'm done now peace out. peace out yall
B000028U0Y|5.0|By any standards, this is a classic.  I don't care if you don't like country music or Johnny Cash, this is still a classic and anyone who knows music will attest to that.  I remember listening to songs off this album that were played on the radio.  After watching the movie &#34;Walk the Line,&#34; I knew I had to have this album.  Great hits by Cash and one by a Folsom inmate will have you listening to this album time and time again.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I spend way too much time playing on my Kindle and the deluxe version has really made it tough to put it down.  The new figures are very interesting and challenging.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very challenging and fun! easy to learn, great to play, buy with lots fun in your future! takes no time to learn!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I like that I can buy just the shows I want without having to pay a huge subscription for cable or satellite TV.  Got hooked on this series watching season 1 and 2 on Netflix.  Show is all about hope when hope is really hard to come by.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great Characters, plot filled with Historical substance. Easy to empathize with characters. Follett always paints a true to life narrative. Excellent novel from an excellent author.
B0068THAGY|2.0|Every time I try to watch someting on Amazon on my computer the volume is way too soft to hear anything,<br />can this be fixed?
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I'll probably upgrade to the paid version if I want more options, but the basic app works great! I like the nightstand feature, it looks and acts like a regular alarm clock.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Fun movie- good shape- and was exactly what they sd it would be.<br />Glad I bought it. word word word.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|My favorite scenes involve Loki and Hulk, as well as Hulk in Thor. Watch it to see and you will laugh too.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is one of the handiest things I have on my phone, every time I need something I just put it on my note pad.
B008LOSGUI|5.0|My 7 year old grandson who is enamored with all things medical, loves this set. With help from his brother, it was constructed in no time. He really enjoys it.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This is what everybody should have , you can not have enough protection you phone. Sometimes you end of with items you just do not use anymore.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|The movie was a good one to see, but it did not live up to the hype I had heard about it.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|The movie was very predictable, cheesey, and really over-utilized cheesey lines.  It was just a shadow of the first movie.<br /><br />Amazon streaming was flawless though!
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|Difficult to keep names of characters & places straight.  Well designed plot.  Must read first two books before reading this one.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Knowing nothing about this story except what I saw in the commercials for the movie, I decided to take a chance on it out of sheer curiosity to see how it would match up to &#34;The Old Man and the Sea&#34;, which was the work I thought it would most be like and one of my favorite books.  I thought at first that &#34;Life of Pi&#34; might just be a cool adventure/survival story that would lightly rehash the central allegories of that classic.  And I was thinking if done poorly, it would not hold interest within the first few pages and I could just move on. But this book took me by surprise in 2 ways.<br /><br />First, it reads quickly and (for me, anyway) was always interesting even through the first part, where we learn about what gives Pi his perspective and spiritual strength.  It's not just a slog through the better part of a year on a lifeboat, which had the potential to be REALLY boring, even with a tiger thrown in.<br /><br />Second, the allegories followed me around for days after I was done with the book.<br /><br />From one perspective, you can break the book's &#34;message&#34; down to a simple choice between the hard reality of earthly existence and the fantastical stories and fables found in every religion. It assumes that although many people still think &#34;faith&#34; means believing in these stories as factual chronicles, more modern, &#34;enlightened&#34; thinking would have it that these stories are fictional tools to enable people of varying degrees of spirituality (and intellect) to grasp the underlying messages of good and evil.<br /><br />But I don't think that Mr. Martel wants you to stop there.  He tries to give his story a sort of greater objectivity by having Pi not only accept, but embrace the 3 major religions of the world.  In this, I think he's trying to assert that a person could be 3 times as spiritually enlightened as anyone else and he would STILL need to create a &#34;better&#34; story to deal with a set of horrific circumstances.And we are shown that Pi's story is the tool with which he retains his faith, even though in the midst of his ordeal, he finds himself forced to &#34;suspend&#34; some of the central tenets of his blended personal religion, compromising all 3 dogmas instead of finding spiritual refuge in one or the other.<br /><br />The exercise is not just in choosing the way we view the allegory (or whether there is one at all), but in following the descent into hopelessness and coming out of that pit with one's faith tested, but still intact.<br /><br />There are some things that I'll admit I didn't get, but I assume that's just the author leaving things open-ended for the reader to interpret.  At the other end of the spectrum, although some reviewers have found the gore to be excessive, I thought it worked in helping convey the horror in the story.<br /><br />But overall, definitely recommended.
0316227706|5.0|Can't help by smiling when looking at these great pics.  You'd never think this is what a dog looks like when they are going for a ball or something else underwater.  Highly recommended for any dog lover.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I liked the move. Some of it was a little painful to watch as I don't believe these movies are just fiction and fantasy anymore. I am not sure if art is imitating life or vice versus. There were a few surprises and I really liked the performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
1416955070|2.0|It's possible I may have started this book with the wrong frame of mind. Frankly, while writing this review I'm flat out exhausted from a busy weekend. I award 1 star ratings for stories I absolutely hate, so this one will get 2 stars because the made up fantasy world just didn't grab me. And I'm not interested in learning made up vocabulary for this new world.  The immature teens are a bit bothersome and the plot moved too slow. In some ways I was reminded of Harry Potter:  \\"Kids with Powers Take on Dr. Evil.\\"<br /><br />I got as far as chapter 11 and flounced. Maybe the movie will be entertaining but I'm ready to move on to some other titles waiting patiently on my Want to Read shelf.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was a good one!  Well worth the money. After you've. finished the game, check out the extra playable chapter. Nice surprise.
B00005JSGK|5.0|My dad has been dying to see this movie again so I bought it when I saw Amazon had it. It's a good movie and in good condition.
B005WFUZTE|5.0|If you are a Megadeth fan this is a great album. Dave and the boys do not stray from their roots and produce another great head banging release!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|An excellent book. Looking forward to reading the next two in the trilogy and Anything else new by this author.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|always interesting and challengeing. more than just a coin game it has levels and achievements. a good daily escape. highly recommend
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have used this knife sharpener for about a week or 2 and really like it. It sharpens most blades well as long as they are not too far gone...I will definitely recommend it to others.
B0063IH60K|4.0|very enjoyable game. not high tech, but i prefer the simpler setup with solitaire games. i would recommend it to friends.
1400067820|5.0|The third book in Taleb's trilogy, closes the loop: Fooled By Randomness (unacknowledged role of randomness in life), The Black Swan (outsized influence of outliers/unexpected & the post hoc narrative fallacies to explain them) and now Antifragility (how to benefit/not be harmed by these asymmetries).<br /><br />Irrespective of critics, this is probably going to be a very antifragile book (unlike most published works which are very fragile). Must read if you want to learn to identify concave nonlinearities (to be avoided) vs. convex nonlinearities (to be sought out) in your life.
B001O2QW9G|5.0|Gift for my guy who is always rescuing turtles from the road.  It is very well made and adorable. x
B0059XTUXQ|5.0|Margaret Thatcher was an incredible woman and this is an incredible film. Meryl Streep is mesmerizing as Thatcher, and gives and Academy Award Winning performance.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun and fun and fun and boogers and fun and rainbow hearts and fun and smiles and fun stuff. also fun times were had.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I've loved all of the 'Twilight' soundtracks, but this one is beautiful and the songs are so fitting, not only to the final film, but to the saga as a whole. If you're not a 'Twilight' fan and just a man looking to add some romance to your life, then you might want to consider this soundtrack for the woman in your life or to play during a romantic evening, as these songs will definitely add to the ambience and mood. This soundtrack is definitely worth the price.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This Is A Great Series. I only hope they continue to to extend it and not just end it .
098357670X|5.0|I think tom is a master at caricature drawing and there are things in the book that i would have never thought of I love it
B008MZPVP4|4.0|This is a solid EP release. Not my favorite Down effort, but it's pretty good. Check it out and see for yourself.
B0065FIHYA|1.0|Unless you were or are a fan of the comic book, stay away.  I wasted 2 hours of my life sitting thru this.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I do love this game, however, I must admit that I was sad when I had to reset my Kindle Fire and realized I had lost all my data. Even though I didn't spend a dime on the app itself, I did spend a little cash to get a few items to help move the game along a little faster. I love the game, but loathe losing money. Needless to say I won't be downloading this to my Kindle again.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a lovely book, that deals with difficult characters and situations.  Highly recommend this book for a quick, satisfying read.
B008S4FZHI|5.0|Patricia Cornwall has given us yet another fantastic Scarpetta adventure. Lots of action and suspense. She never fails to please
B0099114WO|3.0|I gave this 3 stars but was contemplating only 2.  I'm glad I only rented it through Amazon Instant Video and didn't buy it or spend the money at the movies....even then I feel I wasted my money.  I agree with many who said this was slow and didn't have much of a storyline at all.  I kept wanted to yell at Meryl Streep \\"speak up woman!!\\" and \\"wise up man!!\\" to Tommy Lee Jones.  It seemed ALL they talked about was sex (their counselor mostly) and the actors were afraid to speak of it....that's about the gist of the movie.  No plot, no storyline, not much comedy...just awkward dialog between them.  I also kept looking to see how much of the movie was left...hoping there was time to redeem it...nope, it didn't.  Would I watch this again?  NO!!!!  I could write a lot more here about what was wrong with this movie....but I think just saying in my opinion it was BAD is enough.  I now wish I had rented \\"We Bought A Zoo\\" with Matt Damon, Scarlett Johansson and Colin Ford.  At least it has a good storyline AND comedy....I've been told.  But Amazon Instant Video rental isn't available for this one unless you buy it for $14.99.  That's a shame!
B007NG93CK|5.0|Katyhy Reichs never fails to please. Her books are easy to read and hard to put down. House work gets forgotten when reading one of her books
B005PK56TA|3.0|It's interesting to watch... I can feel the writers trying a little too hard to add something else on every episode. They seems to be quite inspired by Kubrick. It's fun to watch since it's free with Prime membership.
0525952926|3.0|I just finished the Winter of the World and although Ken Follet is one of my favorite writers, it is not as good as the Fall of Giants. The main theme of the book is the WW2 and there are two most important events in WW2 which secured allies victory. #1 is a tough US government stand on the Japan expansionism what eventually led to Japan attacking us and bringing USA to the war on British and Soviet side. It is important also because it turned Japan military thinkers from attacking USSR at its most vulnerable position and it might have been a \\"non surviving condition\\" for the USSR and the loss of war (at least in Europe for the allies). The author describes it well. Yet #2 was the Stalingrad battle. If the USSR lost that battle, it would loose the Red Army oil supply and the USSR would not be able to continue the war. It was one of the most horrible battles not only in the WW2 but in the history yet the author very briefly mention it. If not for the Soviet victory at the Stalingrad, the Europe possibly was controlled by Nazis today.
1416955070|2.0|I've read a few of this different young adult series and this was the only one that I started and didn't feel like reading the rest of the books.  Without throwing out any spoilers lets just say I didn't like the story and the two romantic leads or how those characters were left at the end of the book.
B003YCIE68|5.0|I have always liked this Santa Claus movie more than the others. It is very believable for kids. Dudley Moore adds to the movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This most recent Mitch Rapp thriller stays true to the hallmarks of the series: tight plotting, sympathetic characters, odious villains. Can't wait for the next one!
B00A7CF1QY|3.0|Overall Bourne Legacy is a good flick and a must see for any Bourne series fan.  However, I was a little disappointed on several fronts.  First I think it was in poor form to use and tease the Jason Bourne character to sell and produce the movie without ever actually materializing the character.  In the movie Bourne was reportedly in NYC but there is not even so much as a cameo appearance, save Jason Bourne's picture on some paperwork and identification.  Second I was a little disappointed in some of the &#34;low budget&#34; special effects.  Some of the scenes were clearly animated cartoonish, such as the fight with the wolf in the woods.  The third and final gripe is that the film lacked the &#34;action and amazement&#34; rhythm we have come to expect from a Jason Bourne movie.  Shooting down a Predator with a rifle was an awesome start, but lengthy and mindless motorcycle chasing and difficulty taking out a few Asian rent-a-cops was just disappointing.  Jeremy Renner as a Bourne type character can really work, he is good, but he needs the same top quality script writing we saw in the previous Bourne films.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Prefer Bing, but am using with a KindleFire HD. Hey it's free. What's not to like about free. Hope I can fing a Bing android app.
0740797719|5.0|\\"It may seem such a simple subject, but how to set up a palette is one of the MOST confusing things an artist learns.\\"<br />This remark alone made me to buy the book, I must admit that the three hours I spend reading it gave me more info than (and complemented) all the watercolor books I already have. This book is the only one on the market that explains the most important and unanswered questions regarding the relation of tonal value strategy (Value Range of a pigment) and mixture tactics (HUE of a pigment)  an artist can follow at every possible painting scenario. With this book and a thorough study of Bruce MacEvoy's site lots if not all the questions are been answered.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love my YouVersion. I have has this on my Iphone for over a year. I am having a hards time registering the android version for my KindleFire HD. Hopefully they get the links right so I can take full advantage.
0385535147|5.0|I just love John Grisham and have read every one of his books. This was classic Grisham. It starts in one direction and then moves in another. About half way through I started looking for the twists and tried to figure out where it was going to end up. If you love Grisham you will love this book.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Great book and will read all of them. Love them and would recommend them to everyone. She is definitely fantastic.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I purchased one of those about 10 years ago. It worked flawless until I had a bike accident and the watch got pretty banged up. I didn't even have to think about it: I just bought the exact same model again. I used to spend quite a bit of money for different models and changed watches quite a bit. This SEIKO changed that bad habit of mine.<br /><br />I used to have a Breitling that spend more time in the repair shop than at my wrist. This watch is pretty much maintenance free and looks just as good as the one that cost over 20 times as much :)
B005HSL626|3.0|I tried it a couple times, not fun too me, but ok. I do like the graphics. Its just ok.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Brillian series can recommend to all ages. Have now started to watch series 2. If you're into escapism and fantasy you'll enjoy this.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Again an excellent book. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone I know! She is an amazing writer. Love it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app!! use it all the time.. great for holiday photos. comparable to instagram. five stars all the way
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I do love this game. It is addictive, believe me! Would recommend it to everybody. I have a lot of fun with it.
B000NVT0RU|5.0|good movie for that rain week end. Shows how the French treated their non French soldiers during the war in europe.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It just fun. Nothing spectacular, but a nice app. for just wasting some time.I would recommend it. Its ok too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Oh my goodness! Who does not like this series. These books are definite page turners. I would definitely buy these books again.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Love this author, bought all of her books since I read the first one. I would give them as gifts.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I'm not a reader, but this book was a definite page turner. I would recommend this to lots of people, but very graphic so if you suffered with anything as a child beware.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is fun! But some are really hard, which is also fun! Takes some thought. I would recommend it for sure.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Oh my goodness! Who does not like this series. These books are definite page turners. I would definitely buy these books again.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game, play it when I can all the time. I would definitely recommend it to everyone, it is fun!

B003V1WTMM|5.0|Had never read anything by author before, have them all on my Kindle to read now! Would recommend to everyone1
B0053FANS6|5.0|great!!! really impressed with the quality of all three movies, also like the idea of the complete series.all three movies in one package
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Along with everyone else in the world, I love this show! Don't need to recommend it, I think everyone already has it.
B00913P6G0|5.0|After my first listen to this album I was instantly hooked. the mixtape title Overly Dedicated is what got me on to Kendrick<br />with his art of story-telling which hasn't been in hip hop for a longtime. I can't stop listening to this album I bet 5-10 years from now I'm still gonna be bumpin this classic GKMC is clearly the ablum of the year for me
B008XG1X18|5.0|I do love this app. but I don't really use it on my Kindle. Too small of a screen for me. I use my apple computer. But I love it.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|A very good collection that only falls short in including songs from his &#34;Invincible&#34; album, which was a great underrated comback effort in my book.  Otherwise, expect the originals of songs we all love him for.  Don't like the arrangement on this CD, but with a program like Windows Media Player and a burner, you can fix that.  Worth the money.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|Had the musical numbers in this movie been a bit less lame or not there at all, I would have given this a 5 star rating.<br /><br />They could have done so much better with the songs. They came across as something you would expect from a straight to DVD production, not something of this movie's caliber. It didn't do the film justice at all.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I had to watch it 2+ times to get all of the subtleties but I really like this movie. Would love to see a sequel. Being from Austin I was sad that Lukas Haas was cut out so soon but glad that they had him in it. Inception 2 - bring it!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire because as much as I love the Fire, and I do, it's document handling, at times, is lacking.  The File Explorer does just that and, in addition, gives me an easy way to attach to my 4G Overdrive Pro hotspot's shared storage which means I can access 32 gigs worth of, well, anything I please.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Far from being naive or a prude, I still couldn't get over the sleaze factor. It is just plain icky in my book. That being said, Matthew McConaughey did a great job of being the king of sleaze as did the dancers. Just not into beefcake I guess.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I love that I get news from this app which is more informative than the others I've tried on Amazon.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent, could not put the book down, went from loving the characters, to hating him, hating her, hating them both. Definitely recommend
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I bout it for my nexus 7, i also buy the otg cable and a sd card 32 gb, it have a great size, very very small
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Read the last %60 in 5 hours marathon. Pace comes apart & things get a little silly at the end but its a thoroughly enjoyable  ride getting there.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|I choose &#34;Amok Time.&#34;  This shows much of what it is to be Vulcan.  It also shows the friendship between Spock, Kirk and McCoy.
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun game to play hard to get what you need. but fun trying. like that freinds can get involved. wish you could get diamonds easier.
B008476HBM|5.0|Admittedly, I'm a Jane Austen fan. That said, I think Pride and Prejudice is the best book she ever wrote. The characters are well-drawn and internally consistent, and the story line flows with a sense of inevitability. Oh, yes, I read everything Jane wrote, and almost all of it with pleasure, but I return to reread Pride and Prejudice every year or two for the sheer pleasure of doing so. And what better way to do it than via Kindle?
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I love everything that Pixar does and was really looking forward to this movie.  I wasn't expecting it to be a &#34;brother bear&#34; movie.  We enjoyed it and maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't seen Brother Bear, but I admit being disappointed in the story.  Also, this is the first pixar movie that I won't be letting my small children watch until they are older... maybe 8 or 10.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is a fun game. It has just enough difficulty to keep up a players interest. I had seen the game before and just had to have it.

0393312836|4.0|If you have seen the movie you may as well have read the book.  I do not mean to say that it is a bad book by any means, but don't expect anything more.  The only thing you get more from the book is the last chapter, which was not included in the movie
B000BW7QWW|4.0|After watching this movie I remembered seeing it on TV in the past.. It is a good movie with action and suspense.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Wonderful and magical!!!!makes you laugh and cry and believe in magic again...I want my own secret garden too!!! I love it!
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|I love the characters in this story.  I would re read this book again, also I would recommend this author and series too.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|If you're looking for some good entertainment for a little while to escape and relax, this is a good movie.  It keeps with the whole  MIB profile, but does more character development than alien splattering.  The wife and I enjoyed it.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I'm actually already very comfortable in the kitchen, but the approach he takes fora beginner are the best I've ever seen. I've made several dishes already and was shocked at how drop dead simple and tasty they were.<br /><br />Besides the actually receipes, this book is also loaded with an enormous amount of extra information which I find both useful and very entertaining to read.
B00006IX0R|5.0|I rated this product five stars because the delivery was very quick and the price was excellent.  The CD and case were both in great condition.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The reason you purchase a product such as this is to be able to not have to be bothered with the commercials or anything else while you're wasting your time playing games ......how can I shut them off.......
B008220C38|4.0|This is the fourth time that Leo Tolstoy's 1877 book Anna Karenina gets the big-screen treatment, this time from director Joe Wright, who has impeccable credentials doing historical literary treatments (his earlier movies include the excellent 2005 Pride and Prejudice and 2007 Atonement films).<br /><br />\\"Anna Karenina\\" (2012 release; 130 min.) brings the story of Anna Karenina (played by Keira Knightley), who is married to Russian 'saint' Alexei Karenin (played by Jude Law), in upper class 19th century Russia. Yet Anna is bored out of her mind, and she catched the fancy of Count Vronsky (played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and soon they embark on an ill-fated affair.<br /><br />Several comments: the movie is eye-candy from start to finish. For reasons not clear, the movie cuts back and forth between real-life scenes and a theatre, where some of the scenes are played out. While it allows for some nice and clever shots, it is never made clear why this is happening this way, other than I suppose for production value. The acting performances are great throughout, none more so that Knightley who carries the movie on her shoulders as much as she can. Alicia Vikander as Kitty also was noteworthy (I also saw her in another historical drama, Denmark's excellent \\"A Royal Affair\\", earlier this year--that movie is now playing in selected screens in the US). Yet despite all that, as I was watching this, I never fully connected emotionally and I never got pulled in, a big flaw in any movie I watch. I want to root for a character, or against one, or at least care emotionally. It didn't happen for me in this movie. Last but not least, the art-house theatre I saw this movie in this past weekend here in Cincinnati, was absolutely packed, I mean completely sold out. So there is definitely a strong interest in this movie. Whether it will be a break-out hit will depend on word of mouth. Bottom line, this is certainly not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, but for me it was not as good as it could've been.as good as it could've been.
B000E1ZK3M|5.0|i bought this for my boyfriend and it was still great watching it for the third or fourth time.  i would order from here again.  thanks!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Small town, lots of stuff going on...if you don't mind a relatively depressing story how this town clicks becomes interesting enough. Not quite what I expected but held my interest.
0345803493|5.0|second in the trilogy.  besides the obvious sex, the mystery was good and got better in this book.  the characters got closer on a deeper level too.  good book.
1449410243|1.0|Hello, I am writing from the grave. I bought this book with the hope that it would prepare me for the escalating situation between my cat and myself. When the UPS guy delivered the book, Snowball was (apparently) sleeping in the warm spot next to the heat vent. However after I retrieved the Xacto knife from the junk drawer in the kitchen so I could open the Amazon box, Snowball leaped upon the countertop, swung her fluffy butt into my left hand, which, with deadly precision, plunged the sharp blade into my carotid artery. The last thing I remember before fading into oblivion was the shredding noise of cat-claws on glossy paper. In short, this book did not save me from being killed by my cat, and in fact may have accelerated the process.
B00004TS0E|5.0|Arrived quickly ! High quality ! Great family movie ! This will become one of our annual Christmas traditions for sure !
0143038095|2.0|I was a bit disappointed in this book. Each chapter has a different narrator, and between 8 women, it is hard to remember which one was which. I found it a little difficult to keep up with who was who, even at the end. The stories didn't all come together like I was hoping. The book was good, but it wasn't something that I was anxious to get home to.
0307730697|5.0|I am so glad to have read this book. It is a very well written book, which simply is a true story of a phenomenal man, with incredible strength and courage. The live of Adam Brown is an accounting of redemption, and how one should live a life.  I shall draw on those lessons that Adam Brown's life exemplified.  Finally, the quality of those men with whom he served is manifested in their desire that his story be told, above all others.
B006P0FIGU|2.0|In 1844 Alexander Dumas published Les Trois Mousquetaires which has become one of the world's greatest novels. The story follows the adventures of D'Artagnan and the 3 musketeers set in France in the early 1600s during a time of power struggles and intrigue between the king and church.<br /><br />This movie is a loose remake of the original taking general themes and protagonists but developing new specific plot elements. The general tone is comedic bumbling by our heros keeping them safe but it just doesn't feel right for the seriousness of the stakes (death). The young, hip actors are trying to make a modern, fast-moving drama that retains one's attention but they lose the sense of intrigue, suspense, and gravity that marked the novel.<br /><br />Steer clear of this remake.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love this show. It was awesome to be able to watch the new episodes while Dish was having issues with AMC.
B009O5CLZY|4.0|I like this app sometimes it freezes up or lags on my kindle fire.  I would reccomend it to any one who gets bored. :)
B00A77II0U|5.0|loved it because it had the players guide for the game, I did not have to give up if I was stuck
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Super alarm that I can make custom for me.<br />Its a must have for anyone who uses their device<br />to help keep them on schedule.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I give this five out of five stars.<br />It is full of suspense and plot twists, seeing this once just isn't enough you will want to see to see it again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love how this app gives Bible readings and background info on the scripture.<br />This is a must have for anyone who wants a deeper relation with God.
B0002234LS|5.0|Five out of five stars<br />One of my favorite Johnny Depp movies, full of suspense, plot twists and action. This is a great movie and I recommend it
B009A87ZQU|4.0|Casino Royale was a good movie Blu-Ray makes it even better with the improved quality you get with blu-ray over dvd
B00881VLCE|4.0|great puzzles and it is nice that it sets different challenge levels. they have a great range of puzzles to fill every imagination or need
B009NPKTN6|2.0|was ok.. but didn't really get into the characters.... could have been much better... though it was ok as a rented movie
B007HACDLK|4.0|I like the author and I liked this book a lot. It was a page turner. Looking forward to his next one.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Let me start by saying I didn't get very far in this book, so I can't say whether the plot itself was good.  I'm a huge Harry Potter fan - this was completely different.  Adult situations, with lots of profanities.  Although I wasn't expecting Harry Potter, I didn't expect this.  I was very disappointed.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This is a delightful surprise from Rod! Our tradition includes a Christmas Eve brunch which includes coffee, food, mimosas and of course, music. We take our entertaining seriously which is why this smooth background- friendly contribution will find it's way into heavy rotation.<br />Noteworthy favorites include Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas and the duets with Ella and Michael B. Give this nice addition to the Standards and Classics Christmas crooners a try.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This was a highly entertaining movie.  Well worth the download and the time spent watching it.  I'd actually watch it again.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|I picked up this book because I always thought &#34;some habits are hard to change&#34;. But what a brilliant read. Well researched and well-written, so that anyone can understand it and relate to it. The case studies are well documented and written in an interesting manner so it never feels as if one is reading scientific research.<br /><br />A must read for everyone.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|love it get it plz it rocks the house u draw and somebody guesses it it is so fun I highly recommend this app
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I just loved this movie.  The bond between Hachi and his owner is so touching. The movie does a wonderful job portraying the devotion of dog for his owner and is a wonderful testament of the true meaning of friendship.  Knowing this movie is based on a true story makes it even that much more amazing.  If you are an animal lover, you will appreciate what this movie has to offer; and if you have a pet, you'll want to hug them that much harder tonight.
B00006F1IJ|5.0|Good CD, nice driving music. Low key songs with some solos. No complaints here by me. The band has been around for quite a while.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|One can imagine the people in the story and really brlieve their thoughts. The pictures painted in words are so true.
B000002UV9|5.0|Going to see Queensryche on New Year's so she wanted to get familar again with the music. Nice to see people who sell cds keep them in good shape.
B0011ZNAIC|1.0|There were numbers running in a black banner at the bottom of the screan and it was skipping parts in the movie the entire way thru....i had a 6 year old that was crying because santa brought him a bad movie.....DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Its a really good movie, you'll definitely like it if you saw the first one. I definitely recommend it.  Screw Flanders.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|This guy deserved to win the top spot on American Idol.  He did his own thing, often ignoring the advice of the judges.  He sings original music his own way, and it is great!
B002OSXDAU|5.0|The Fountainhead is just as fresh and inspiring as the first time I read it when it was first puglished. The Kindle edition was very well done. A superior job all around.<br />Fred Sammut
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|when you get to a certain level it force closes on my kindle fire. I cant go into the market to pure haze anything to expand my town. please fix this glitches or I have no choice then to uninstall. its becoming no fun when all I can do is collect from my town folk. thanks
B009H442DG|5.0|The wait is over and I for one could not have been happier with the results. Olivia and John still sound so good together and their affection for each other comes through in every track...nothing is forced or superficial, this truly came from their hearts! The new song, I Think You Might Like It, is soooo much fun and so infectious.  John Farrar scores again.  That's two this year for Olivia, the other being the outstandingly catchy Weightless from Olivia's movie A Few Best Men! Buy this labor of love and help support two amazing causes.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Great action movie made all the better with my favorite action heros all in one movie!!  I hope Expendables 3 will follow!!!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Fabulous alarm clock. Easy customizable settings, various options. Choose to awaken to music of your choice or the regular alarm &quot;noise.&quot; This was a great find!
B006TLZT5A|3.0|The idea of this movie was cute and it has a few classic cirque moments but it really is geared for younger viewers and was rather simple for a cirque du soleil film . Its ok if you rent it for your kids but i wouldnt purchase this after renting it. Didnt wow me at all.
B005K17RU0|3.0|all right at first but noticed that the temps for my town were never the same as what the weather channel or other friends weather radar's were saying. finding a new weather app right now.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I use this mike for You Tube tutorials for which it works just fine.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend for this purpose.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I maybe expected more but got very high rating for book and soldier who wrote it and felt his turmoil from reading the book and glad he made it out successfully and did his job as well as he and all those men did!
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|I thought that was going to be another bad video game movie and I could have not been more wrong.  I hope this movie goes on to show others how to help grow a loved franchise instead of how to make some quick money off of it.<br /><br />I actually really hope that they do another one.
0316227706|5.0|Beautifully photographed with a lot of fun. The dogs were all wonderful and enjoyed turning each page of the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|was not dissapointed with how the story continues for Katniss. Certainly enjoyed the creative plot and death defying adventures for the tributes..did not like the &#34;abrupt ending&#34;.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|In my opinion I thought it was a good movie Bane was a good villian, but not as good as The Dark Knight.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I was hoping that after a year they would have added tablet support, but to this day, the game is clunky and pixelated. do not buy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great! Can recall information to edit or start over. Have used other calculators and they have not work as well.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I bought this book because of the reviews and friends recommending it. I thought that the story line was very boring and predictable! I was really disappointed.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|After the update when I try to save the picture it does not save anywhere. Then application was good since the new update you can edit it but can't save it so what's the point. Please fix.<br /><br />S3 user
B003L77G06|5.0|Best...Show...Ever!! This show is hysterical and I love every single character. Even when you see something coming, it still cracks you up because they do it so well. I love this show and can't wait to see what they come up with next!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like this game! It's quite a challenge when you get into the higher levels and it has a lot of them for a free game.
B00723NWJE|5.0|I am a huge Norah Jones fan, this CD is amazing! Her new songs are wonderful, that girl can sing!
B008D19WBQ|5.0|This came packaged perfectly. And very quickly! It was for Xmas but he couldn't wait. He's picky and says picture quality is great!
B008COD5UI|3.0|The main character is a bit of a poon and the blare witch project style can be a little nauseating at times but its worth the watch.
B008QI6EHQ|5.0|I gave it 5 stars not because it was a good read but because there is nothing like reading Hitlers' own words to realize how evil this guy really was. I only read about half of the book, I 'll bet nobody has read the whole thing! I am guessing that if the citizens of Germany had read it their may not have been a WWII
B005LLSZNM|5.0|The storyline in this season is compelling, keeps you guessing and shocks during each episode. Great writing, acting and story line. Great job Sutter!
1400069289|5.0|Thanks for the fast shipment. I haven't finished it yet but am already starting to understand the power of habit.
B00271SFB6|3.0|The only complaint I have about this rental was the volume of the movie. I had my TV on 90 of 100, Sony Bravia television broadcasting through my PS3 and we could barely hear some of the dialog. The film seemed well made and had a great plot, but I feel like we missed some parts because it was so soft.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Again the Instant Video service is great.<br /><br />The Movie was enjoyable with many aspects of the original pre-Disney fairy tale.  The CGI Was good and the acting was fair.  I would recommend watching at least once if you like fairy tale movies done well.
B000L212HC|5.0|This movie and &#34;The Illusionist&#34; are both great.  The pace and scope of the story is great and I enjoy the actors performances.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie, it was full of action and good special effects.  The story line as fair, and the acting was decent.  I would recommend renting this movie as I did, but I am unsure if it was good enough that I would buy on DVD or Blu-Ray.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|When I have to wait to see say A doctor, DMV, the wife to get done shopping  and so on
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I rented this on Amazon and was quite pleased with the streaming quality.  Would recommend the service.<br />On to the Movie.  I enjoyed the movie and the story line as well.  I will end up buying this on Blu-Ray
B000H8RVUW|4.0|The packaging isn't in what I, personally, would call &#34;very good.&#34; However the vinyl itself is in pristine condition, and that's definitely what matters. I feel like it was priced a bit high, but this record has proven difficult to find so I really can't complain too much.<br />It was the last vinyl I ordered and the first to arrive, very happy with the speedy shipment.<br />And, like I said, the record itself is flawless. Thanks again!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I love the movies, what else can I say.  Getting them in this Blu-Ray Pack was just something I couldn't pass up.  They look and sound great on my Home Entertainment system.  Highly recommended.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|Review DYLAN ? I don't think it's possible. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This great little app is a must.  Very simple &amp; easy to use... comes in very handy.  I use it often.
B003Z6WFWC|5.0|It was profound in the way that many movies cannot be no matter how much they try. Truthful, and also powerful. Great acting and I cried twice!
B00A6N8YTU|1.0|Gave it a shot, but it moves far too slowly and none of the characters engaged me enough to care what happened to them. It's just not interesting or exciting. FAIL.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo25Q1Q7X2EQFNX]]Move it is fun and addictive. It has a very colorful game screen and pieces. Initially it may look like a Tetris type game, It's not though. It's much more fun and mentally challenging. It's a puzzle really. You need to move the blocks in such a way as to enable you to move the red square to the corresponding square on the gameboard. This requires logic to do so in the least number of moves. Once you move the red square to the goal, a little \\"Ta-Da\\" is played and the square is whisked off the board. I love the animation.<br /><br />The game starts you off at an easy level so you learn how to play. There are a lot of levels so you won't get through this quickly.<br /><br />The only thing for me was that the music got repetitive rather quickly. It would be cool if you could choose from several different tunes.<br /><br />This is a great game for all ages.
B009SIE6AA|5.0|I Love James Taylor.  Hearing  his voice and new sound singing favorite Christmas songs was a nice surprise. Thank you
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Good movie, I may want to watch again someday. Acting was pretty good and the story line kept me rivited.
B007THA4FI|5.0|No, it is not Harry Potter, it is Jane Austen - &#34;three or four families in a country village.&#34;  No there are no high waisted gowns or rose gardens or eligible bachelors, but this story of ordinary people trying to survive ordinary life kept me riveted.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Was skeptical going in. How good could a movie be based on a board game? They pulled it off though and it's an entertaining and fun movie. If you like Transformers, you'll like this movie as well.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I enjoyed this CD very much. I can't wait until the concert tour comes to Pittsburgh this summer. CD arrived on tie and in good condition.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Was skeptical about a remake of an old time favorite &#34;soap&#34; from when I was a teenager, but Johnny Depp and Tim Burton pulled it off and absolutely loved it! Can you find the original stars in the cameos? :)
B002ZG999U|5.0|I bought this for my brothe for his birthday. I took him to &#34;The Expendables 2&#34; last summer and he enjoyed it. I'm haven't seen &#34;The Expendables 1&#34; yet but if the sequel is any indication them I'm sure it is action filled and worth watching.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I thought the movie had a good set of diverse characters that pulled everything together.  The action/fight scenes were pretty realistic and believable since no one was completely invincible.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book threw me back in time with characters living this life in a society that was extremely unreal.  It was a part of my history as well as a decedent of a plantation in LA with the stories being passed down of G G G father visiting the slaves quarters.  It was well written and one could feel the pain, frustration, and fear of managing such a society.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|This book is a fast paced action book with sarcastic humor mixed in.  Its a great start to a great seried.  Loved it!
B002TWWOHE|5.0|I love this show.  Its always entertaining and the plot twists are always leaving me ready for another season.  I have recommended this show to a lot of friends.
B002H3EUA4|5.0|This movie is one of the best ever made, whether it be for Christmas or not. Its one of my all time favorite movies and I could watch it time after time. The comedy and movie quotes have stuck with me since day one and I know MANY of my friends who know right off the bat which movie its from..
B006VGGAC4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Arnold is an amazing person.  I was blown away at his organized and positive lifestyle that took him from a poor immigrant to a very wealthy and prominent man.  This book should be read by young people to get a sense of how each decision one makes contributes to their lot in life.  It was enjoyable, funny, emotional and just a very good read.  I recommend it for all ages.  I loved it!
B000VIPJKM|4.0|A bit cheesy and slow but entertaining for the those like me who saw it in their younger days whe it was released or the teen and 20-something girls.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I had a hard time trying to make myself put the book down but I couldn't. I don't think I have ever read a book that I have been so into where I just didn't want to take myself away from it. I would definitely recommend this book to young married or single women. And I am pretty sure that boyfriends or husbands would appreciate them reading this book. It's a definite must read!!
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I still simply cannot believe that such a magnificant voice emminates from that woman.  As often as I've listened to her sing, I'm still amazed.  And, she can sing such a great range of musical styles.  From soaring songs from Broadway musicals to seductive torch songs, she does it all...with panache.  Even her choice of music for the albums is surprising.  From the title I expected this CD to be the type of songs she sang on &#34;England's Got Talent&#34; -- like stunningly powerful music she sang from Les Miserables and Cats.  There is a little of that on this CD, but most were old standards.  And, while enjoyable, to me they weren't &#34;show-stoppers&#34;.  The two songs she included from Phantom of the Opera were duets sung with male counterparts.....&#34;Music of the Night&#34; with the original Phantom and &#34;SayYou Love Me&#34; with Donny Osmond.  I really expected to not like that track, but it's ended up being one of my favorites.<br /><br />Why, then, only 4 stars?  I was expecting something very different.  That one missing star reflects my disappointment.  However, if you don't buy the CD with the same expectations on content that I had, and if you love Susan Boyle's voice as much as I do, I'm sure you'll love this album.  I'm looking forward to her next offering.  I'd love to hear her sing some of the &#34;show-stoppers&#34; from the great operas.  That would be sublime.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell delivered another consistently exciting and riveting read.  For those of you who are faithful readers....you will not be disappointed.  For those of you who are new, my advice is to start at the beginning of the series and read them all.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I knew going into it that it wasn't my kind of movie, but I tried to like it. My partner thought it was entertaining. I slept through most of it.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Recently bought the blu ray version and watched it again. This movie always makes me laugh, even when I know what's going to happen next. It's a staple in our Christmas movie collection, watch it every year!
B0086700CM|5.0|Excellent game for the Kindle. I am able to control the movement of the runner and get a good feel of the game
B007T99ENE|4.0|Would recommend it. And did, to a friend who confessed to not being a McEwan fan, And even she (grudgingly) admitted to its quality. Great central character. Lovely twists
159562015X|2.0|this was one of those endeavors that just didn't pan out. It is just not exact science; there are too many variables open to discussion.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|It is one of these books (and I find this a LOT) where the book gets off to a fine start and keeps you guessing and interested until nearly the end then TO ME it's like they think &#34;Oh look how much i've written I'd better finish this up now&#34; and they just finish it off any old way. I think too many authors get a good idea and write a good story but a great author always has a great  ending and this particular ending is like fizzle fizzle..... damp  squib. :(
0790729350|5.0|Who knows... watching the DVD and then drifting into a daydream could be transformative. This is a tumultuous snapshot of strange days.
B000T433CO|3.0|looking for a funny light holiday movie, it was OK, but as title said, was a little heavy.  still a good watch though
B001NY9YNQ|4.0|I have always liked Tesla and I bought this album to listen to the acoustic recordings.  The best is catching them live!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|A must have for your collection. One of the classics for the holidays buy it for the children keep it for the grandchildren.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book and interesting insider knowledge to the Navy Sniper's life and training!<br /><br />I want to read more tom this author!
0062183591|4.0|My name is Celeta and I'm currently working on a Masters in Fraud and Forensics at Carlow University in Pittsburgh.  [...]    I read Ariely's book for a research class and found many interesting theories such as the Simple Model of Rational Crime (SMORC). This theory was new to me so I thought it was an interesting model that shows how an individual will run a cost-benefit analysis to see what rational decision is best. This makes a lot of sense because we weigh our options in many aspects of life no matter how big or small. I found the S.W.O.T analysis useful in Undergrad studies and will still refer to it for vacations or major purchases.  The SMORC test results were a little surprising to me. I had a preconceived notion that people would go all out when they cheat and make it worth their while. The findings of the study were the opposite. There were a lot of people cheating by a little bit each and the rational Ariely stated made sense when he said \\"Essentially, we cheat up to the level that allows us to retain our self-image as reasonably honest individuals.\\" (p.23). I agree with Ariely if I cheated by a little I would still think I'm a good and honest person.    The only critique I have for Ariely and the weakness I saw in the book pertained to him sharing his accident and his theory on being watched as it correlates to honesty. Ariely shares the story about being burned and the care he received during his recovery. I was encouraged by his bravery and his willingness to share something very personal so openly. I just wonder if they experience had any effect on his ability to talk about medical care in a different capacity without having a bias. I didn't find any clear evidence I just stumbled upon that thought out of curiosity. The weakness I found in the book was the study where Ariely relates people being watch to them being more inclined to be honest. I would have liked to see a study that contains information about people that have repeatedly lied or were dishonest to see if the theory worked on them. Some people can lie with a straight face and no remorse so I'm not so sure I agree with the findings of the University of Newcastle experiment from Chapter 9.    As I prepare for a career in Fraud and Forensics I feel this book is a great tool that I can refer to in the future. I learned to open my mind and put my preconceived notions aside and work more diligently with the findings of the study. I don't have to agree with the results but I need to be willing and able to interpret them thoroughly. Ariely gave a very realistic view about dishonestly. I don't want to say he shows a way it can be a good thing but I will say he showed me it's not as bad as the stigma has always been.

B0042JTAI8|3.0|The Distant Hours though a good read and gripping at times , contained too many stories within stories and as a result lost itself along the way to an ending. The eldest sister 'Percy' becomes implausible at the end when her lost love is revealed. Too much loaded on this bitter character and some confusion around whether she is mad, bad or sad. 'Saffy' is weak and irritating. Poor old 'Juniper&#34; begins hopefully as a strong character with independence and 'joie de vivre' . She appears deeply in love, ready to flaunt convention but disappoints by becoming insane and incapable.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Great book, couldn't turn my kindle off! It is one of those books that you want to keep reading to see how the story plays out, the end threw me for a twist as I wasn't expecting the visit back to old stomping grounds, but overall I would recommend this book for anyone who wants a quick read!
B0098VYKSA|5.0|That I really enjoyed this movie!  I don’t' think Charlize Theron can do a bad movie!  Love every movie she has ever been in!!!  She's a wonderful actress!!!!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Well worth seeing if you didn't get the chance to see it on the big screen. This film is highly recommended.

B008220C56|3.0|I have never read ANNA KARININA, nor do I expect to.  Here's what I knew about the book going into the movie:  it was written by Leo Tolstoy and (spoiler ahead) the lead character throws herself under a train.  Oh, and it's set in Russia sometime before the fall of the Czars.<br /><br />So I went into the film with few expectations, and I will be unable to comment on whether this adaptation is faithful or not.  But I can opine on if I liked the movie.<br /><br />It tells the tale of Anna, the wife of an aristocrat/politician.  She lives in St. Petersburg, with her husband and young son.  But when travelling to Moscow to try to ask her sister-in-law to make up with her womanizing scoundrel of a husband, she meets a dashing young officer and the two launch into a torrid and scandalous affair.  Misery ensues.<br /><br />I know this sounds a bit dismissive, but I don't intend it to be.  I think that if you don't know the story, it would be unfair of me to tell you more, as the twists and turns, both romantic & political, are most of the fun in the story.<br /><br />Director Joe Wright (ATONEMENT) has, in a huge error, tried to stage this movie as though it were an elaborate stage production.  The actors move around an enormous theater and various pieces of scenery roll in and out.  All parts of the venue become staging areas, including the rafters, the wings and the audience.  Sometimes, though, this conceit lapses.  This lapse always occurs when there are scenes staged \\"in the country\\"...and it occurs to the viewer eventually that much like Tolstoy always did, Wright is trying to convey that city life, politics, petty affairs of the rich, etc.  are all transient and theatrical...the only \\"real\\" things are of and for the land and thus, Mother Russia.  We meet several key characters who achieve a form of salvation through connecting or reconnecting with the land.  This is a noble (if grossly oversimplified) idea, and it is in fact these outdoor, on location scenes that perhaps fare the best...they are freed from the staginess of the rest of the film.  But Wright spends much of the film, particularly in the early going, letting us see how the scenery rolls in and out and how cleverly he has staged everything that the story itself is practically a distraction.  I understand WHAT he is trying to convey...but it is done with such artifice and clumsiness that it fails.  I appreciate his efforts, but all his showiness deflates much of the emotion of the film.<br /><br />Keira Knightley plays Anna, and she gives another solid performance in a \\"period piece.\\"  She looks great in her costumes, moves with regal authority and to her credit, isn't afraid to make her character unlikeable.  At times, with side with Anna as she rebels against societal shackles and yearns for passion.  At other times though, she flings herself headlong into reckless behavior that threatens her relationship with her children, her standing in society, her husband's career and even her own sanity.  Knightley embraces all these sides with gusto.  Her performance makes this movie worth seeing.<br /><br />Jude Law is her husband.  It's a little unsettling seeing him playing the older, repressed politician.  When did he age?  But then I remember that he can still play spry and fun (SHERLOCK HOLMES), and I realize what a terrific, contained performance he's giving.  Yes, he's repressed and dreadfully dull.  He's also heartbreakingly perplexed when he sees Anna's behavior.  He was truly the character I rooted for most consistently, even as I realized he was not exactly great husband and father material.<br /><br />As the young soldier, Aaron Johnson (KICK ASS, NOWHERE BOY) tries awfully hard.  He is not assisted by a costume and hairstyle that make him look like he belongs in the \\"Rock Me Amadeus\\" music video...but Johnson is all softness and \\"baby-like.\\"  I can almost see why Anna is initially attracted to him.  He is clearly attracted to her, he's somewhat dashing and he's capable of passion.  But he's revealed to be selfish, whiney and ultimately more concerned with his happiness than hers.  Some of this is the script, but Johnson does little to dig deeper into his character to find something to make us care for him as the events of the story begin to spin out of control.<br /><br />Overall, this is a film more interesting than compelling.  Knightley and Law make it worth seeing, but it also fades quickly from the memory.  I would give it 3.3 stars.  If Wright had refrained from unneeded theatricality, it would be a 4 star film.
B00881VLCE|2.0|When I try to download new puzzles for this app, they download, but never show in the toolbar for the Kindle Fire HD.  I loved this puzzle game when it was on my old Kindle.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Ang Lee's adaptation of the strangely beloved novel is, to my recollection (it's been a few years since I read the book) quite faithful to both the events and the spirit of the novel.  And thus, it has many of the same successes and failures of the source material.<br /><br />Pi is a young man, living in India with his family.  They run a zoo there, and Pi learns to love animals.  He's also a boy full of curiosity, and as he becomes acquainted with Hindu, Catholic & Jewish beliefs and traditions, he embraces a hodge-podge of ideas.  He selects what sounds good to him, or what is most helpful to him in coming to understand the world around him...both what he sees and what can't be seen.<br /><br />Eventually, the family is forced by political upheavals to move the entire zoo enterprise to Canada.  But on the sea voyage across the Pacific, a terrible storm hits and the ship sinks.  Pi finds a lifeboat, but so do several zoo animals, including, most importantly, the Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker.  The bulk of the movie deals with Pi and Parker's LOOOONG sea voyage and how they survive a harsh environment, the wondrous things they see and the relationship they establish.<br /><br />Lee has filmed this saga in 3D, and I recommend you see the film this way if you can.  The 3D is some of the most sparkling and dazzling since AVATAR.  While it's clear much of the film must be CGI, the CGI rarely shows.  In fact, it is nearly impossible to believe that the tiger wasn't flesh & blood much of the time.  It is rendered dazzlingly.  In fact, the whole movie sparkles in a way that creates a heightened reality (or, puts a touch of fantasy onto reality).  There's no question in my mind that from a technical perspective, LIFE OF PI is one of the best this year.<br /><br />The story itself is undeniably gripping.  I liked that no sentimental relationship is developed between Pi and the tiger.  This animal is a killer.  It is wild and dangerous.  The two create an understanding, but there is never mutual affection.  It is not a story of anthropomorphism.  There are many utterly gripping scenes (the storm is particularly effective), a fair number of humorous moments and some scenes that are simply gorgeous to look at.  Even though the pace is somewhat deliberate at times, I was never bored.<br /><br />But, as with the book, PI wants to be profound.  The narrator of the film (I won't say more about who that is) tells a listener, \\"you will believe in God\\" after hearing the story.  I not see how this story could make someone believe in God.  The ending essentially attempts to be a validation of the young Pi's early ideas about embracing what you want from various religions rather than needing to follows all the dictates of just one belief system.  While one could debate the merits of this argument (and the other argument the end of the film posits, which I won't hint at for fear of spoiling things)...there is NO emotional heft to them within the LIFE OF PI.  This was the huge failing of the book, which told such a splendid story, only to diffuse it all with poppycock pop spiritualism.  Lee, rightfully so, I suppose, has not changed this...but his film also collapses under the mundane nature of this films revelations.  (PI author Yann Martel's follow-up novel BEATRICE AND VIRGIL suffers the same bloated sense of self-importance, but is also unpleasant to read).<br /><br />I know others find the insights of LIFE OF PI to be nearly miraculous.  I'm sorry, I just don't see it.  To me, this story has become one of those things we now teach in schools (my daughter had to read it in high school) because it SEEMS as though it has great literary import.  The fact is, it is 97% wonderful, but 3% utter navel-gazing.  That 3% can't completely destroy what has become before, but it sure left a bad taste in my mouth, both in book or cinematic form.  By all means, you should see it.  Ang Lee has done some of his best work here.  But take it for what it is, andnot for what it pretends to be.
1452110581|4.0|Ridiculously cute photos of cats throughout the book. About half of the poems are very funny and witty, the other half are obvious filler and cringe-worthy. Fun little novelty though, overall it was $8 well spent.
1250027624|4.0|This is a cool book for Downton fans.  It has lovely pictures and gives great backgrounds for all the main characters; what their lives would've been like, they're upbringing, etc.  I enjoyed it greatly.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|I thought this movie was funny and worth the cost. Although I am  glad I waited to see it on video and not the theater.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|From the trailer, this movie looked amazing.  But watching it, I hated it.  You don't end up caring for any of the characters, and you in fact hope they die so that there is something unexpected.  The entire movie is predictable and boring, though with stunning visual effects.  Don't waste your money - go watch a different movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The plot has so many. Twists and turns,  yet, James does a wonderful job of letting the reader.understand their emit ions and why try hey feel that way, slowly as the story unfolds. The erotica of the story ONLY adds to the strong emotions
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Solid, entertaining, thoughtful novel.  It will appeal to Elantris fans.  I was hooked on Brandon Sanderson after reading the Mistborn series and The Way of Kings.<br /><br />The protagonist is interesting, spunky and very snarky.  Great bedside book.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was everything that I have heard and everything that I have imagined. I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. If I have any lament, it would be that superheroes of Marvel and DC look so skinny as opposed to the comics. REMEMBER THE WORDS OF LOKI: &#34;THE ANT HAS NO QUARREL WITH THE BOOT!&#34; LOL!
B0086449YA|2.0|I still stand by knopfler's work since I hope good material is still coming.  Pivateering seems to lack motivation as if going through the motions - slow, a bit tired, and hardly a rousing beat to be found.  I assumed a double album meant lots of new material but I keep hearing the same old vocal and guitar riffs re-hashed with similar lyrics.  It's possible a good album could have been extracted out of both discs but I doubt it.  Obviously not everyone will agree on which albums they enjoy the most so I should point out that \\"Shangri-La\\" has a hole worn in it's mp3 file from use.  Sailing to Philadelphia and Get Lucky are also favorites.
B0057567P0|2.0|This will not work with external drives that draw more power than the USB port itself. Since there are few or no drives that fit this bill the product is kind of pointless. Buyer beware! While the device has a &#34;connector&#34; on the side apparently for an external power source that could solve the power issue, Sonnet does not support that function. Buyer beware. Research and know what you are getting.

B007SGM084|1.0|Do not know why this book was so highly talked about.  The storyline was booring as well as the sexual content of the book.
0547884591|2.0|I fell in love with the title of this book ever since it was announced a year or so ago. Cooking is something I do a lot of but I'm not good by any means (only competent). I also agreed with the marketing that other cook books haven't worked. I've tried them all from the big southern books to the quick cook books. This book said it would lay out a step by step guide to becoming a great chef.<br /><br />When the book came around to being published and the premise switched from cooking to learning anything I was very concerned. I wanted to learn about cooking so I hesitated to buy the book. I wanted to see the book in person and judge for myself. Unfortunately (or fortunately for Tim) it's not sold in any stores. I finally caved in last week and purchased the book. I've even finished my first meal. Which however, wasn't good. That left me very disappointed even though I followed the \\"fool proof\\" instructions.<br /><br />After having some time to look over and read through the whole book I'm even more disappointed. I wouldn't consider this a cookbook. It meanders through a bunch of random barely related topics and dishes without any cohesion. Less is more and this book should've taken the chef topic seriously.<br /><br />The bad.<br /><br />1. Food Choices. This book chooses a slow carb diet for you (and bizarre recipes like squirrel and crickets). I lift weights regularly and I'm not interested in slow carbing but every recipe is a slow carb recipe. Each step needs more choices. People don't eat the same things. Go out with some of your friends and they will almost always order something you never would've considered. The food choices are just very bizarre and unconventional. If Tim wants to shock his dinner guests with taboo thats cool but I dont need to. I'd rather shock them with great food.<br /><br />2. Not cheap. The book promises you won't need a lot of tools. This is a lie. He outlines about $200 of equipment you need before you even start (optional items wellover $2000). Then however the very first recipe asks me to use a vegetable brush (what the heck is that). This wasn't even covered anywhere int he equipment lists. How is that a \\"fool proof\\" first recipe?<br /><br />3. Confusing. The book promises to be non confusing yet it's anything but. It's as if the book was written by multiple sources that don't know what each other is writing. For example, we learn Osso Buko means bones cut and he shows pictures of bones cut but he never even explains how to cut the bones.<br /><br />4. Off topic. Pigeon catching, Hobo can cooking (using a soda can), Squirrel cooking, Garbage can cooking, Beef heart. It gets to a point where shocking isin't shocking. It's just undesired and unwelcomed. I don't need to be consistently shocked by a book. I just want to learn to be a good cook/chef.<br /><br />The good.<br /><br />1. Meta Learning. I havent had time to test this but i hadn't seen this before and to me it was a unique approach and I'm very interested in testing this and seeing if it works.<br /><br />2. Cooking tips. You have to hunt but if you have patience you can find some decent anecdotes lying around, such as the seasonings for different countries flavors. Braising etc.<br /><br />Overall.<br /><br /> I'm saddened that this book isin't easier to use, simpler and more about actual meals. I don't think it's not worth the money tho and it was a fair purchase. However, don't buy this book if you want to learn how to become a chef. Which, understandably by the title, is very confusing. Tim is a great marketer and this purchase for me feels more like I'm just a passenger in his whimsical tale of peculiarities. This isin't a book for readers who want to cook or learn. It's much more a book for Tim to do and write about whatever odd thing he currently hasn't yet tried.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|What I was hearing about this movie before I saw it and what my own reservations might have been:<br /><br />1. It was too long with not enough action<br />2. Too many characters in one movie, not able to thoroughly cover each one<br />3.  Anne Hathaway: great actress but as Selina Kyle? I don't know if that's going to work. (This was a major issue for me)<br />4. Every other summer blockbuster I had seen so far sucked i.e. Snow White and the Huntsmen, The Hunger Games<br />5. Batman Begins= good enough. The Dark Knight= better. The Dark Knight Rises= is it just going to let me down? How are they going to end the trilogy while supplying some sort of feeling of completion?<br /><br />I like short reviews so I will cover these 5 points briefly<br /><br />1. It was too long without enough action.<br /><br />  I was entertained the entire time. I didn't feel there was a minute of wasted time in this whole movie.<br /><br />2. Too many characters in one movie, not able to thoroughly cover each one.<br /><br />  Disagree. That is all.<br /><br />3. Anne Hathaway: great actress but as Selina Kyle? I don't know if that's going to work. (This was a major issue for me)<br /><br />  This girl continues to impress me with her acting and is quickly becoming one of my favorites. I will never doubt her again.<br /><br />4. Every other summer blockbuster I had seen so far sucked i.e. Snow White and the Huntsmen, The Hunger Games<br /><br />  The Dark Knight Rises was the only movie I really wanted to see that summer and the two movies I saw in theatres before completely ruined it for me. I was afraid I would be let down again. Should have saved my money for what I was actually waiting for. Lesson learned.<br /><br />5. Batman Begins= good enough. The Dark Knight= better. The Dark Knight Rises= is it just going to let me down? How are they going to end the trilogy while supplying some sort of feeling of completion?<br /><br />  All I have to say is when the movie was done I felt like I needed to give a standing ovation, even though I watched it by myself (so what if I am a loner!!) The movie ended just as any good movie should, it left me wanting more.

B00004U45G|4.0|While this may not be their best musical outing it is pretty historic. Having Jimi Page set in with any band is historic and I am a huge Crowes fan. Not the best outing for Chris Robinson, he at times sounds like he has a head cold or his sinuses plugged with booger sugar. in any case  I will not further speculate however Like I said I like the crowes and I am a Zep fan too. I found lots to like here.
B009FXIICK|4.0|I was excited to find Zookeeper for the KF as I have played the original 2 on the computer many times. The game runs smooth and looks great! The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the absence of &#34;quest mode&#34;, which I found rather fun to play. Still worth the download though! :-)

B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Earlier reviewers said this movie is slow moving and they may have a point however, the acting skills were fantastic and I was moved (teary eyed.....not an out right cry) a couple of times.  The truth is: This movie reflects what happens when marriages get lost.

B00498SDN0|4.0|It's too bad that the &#34;chicken&#34; issue got added after the original.  I understand how it helped develop the plot line, but it came out of nowhere and it really didn't fit the character.  And it's too bad that Part III got so dark and bawdy (even though I understand how easy it was to fall into that because of the plot line) that even my kids decided it was inappropriate for their ages, because it meant that I had to cajole them (and fill them in on what happened at the end of Part II) into watching Part III, which they ended up enjoying throroughly and was as wholesome as Part I.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|The pictures and instructions suggest placing this on a surface and drawing the knife over it.  I find it works much better holding the knife blade-up and sliding this over from shoulder to tip.  If you hold the sharpener with thumb and fore-finger (not in your palm) it's perfectly safe.  And this way your wrist can rotate to better match the shape of the blade.

B008NABUU8|4.0|This game is a challenging yet entirely doable bridge builder.  Unlike some of the bridge building games I have tried, every level I have tried so far is easily doable with some thought behind it.  Sometimes it is hard to get the bridge passed for both cars and trucks, but usually just cars isn't a problem.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I won't get into the debate of whether Nolan failed on the last part of the trilogy or the ending, etc...there is plenty of commentary on line discussing this. The facts are the movie is long, but entertaining. Nolan's rendition of the Batman is the best to hit the big screen and the closest to the gritty, 'dark' Batman that many love vs. the cartoon style Batman of the TV old TV show and the previous films. The Blue-ray transfer is great, the film is a joy to watch and in the same style as the previous 2 movies. While not perfect, it is a nice ending to the Nolan Batman trilogy and a great addition to any Batman fan's collection.

1612680011|5.0|The book was in great conditions. A lot of times when you buy a book even though it is new, people don't store it in proper places. It was not the case with this purchase. The book was perfect!  so I highly recomend this seller.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Very good and breathaking. I will look forward for a continuation. I read the book in two days without almost stopping.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I wouldn't have believed that Rod Stewart would make such a beautiful Christmas album but this is really beautiful. It has some kick to it as well!  Just a great CD.  Very surprised!!!

0545123275|2.0|The story line and writing was pretty simple and put me off right away.  Also, the constant switching of the point of views left me frustrated. It was an extremely slow read and took me forever to get through; the plot was just sooooo slow.<br /><br />First of all Grace fell in love with a wolf, a wolf, not a boy, a wolf years before she found out he could turn into a boy. This really creped me out, I am all for the paranormal romance scene with vampires and werewolves and even ghosts and everything but normally they fall in love with the human then find out they are something else NOT the other way around. I also felt that the characterization was not likable in either Grace or Sam.<br /><br />One good thing about this book was that it had an interesting and unique take on werewolves which I found refreshing from the boring mundane a million times over done views.<br /><br />But yes, true to my nature I will most likely be reading the second book. (I did hear that one was better from people that gave this one similar review ratings to mine).
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Yeah it's amazing... WHEN ITS WORKING RIGHT! Whenever I try to put on a sticker or any effect, it stops working. Please fix! Because I loved it
0439023491|5.0|Sparks are igniting, flames are spreading and the Capitol wants revenge.<br /><br />Against all odds, Katniss has won the Hunger Games. She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.<br /><br />Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.<br /><br />In Catching Fire, the second novel of the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.<br /><br />Hunger Games number 75 has a very surprising and artfully crafted twist, not just with the actual game but with the characters as well. I think I was pulled in more by this book than the first book of the Hunger Games because I was already drawn into what was happening and this second book just managed to carry things into a whole other level. Catching Fire gives the reader a greater perspective on what is happening around the whole area and how the political upheaval is being played out everywhere.<br /><br />Readers also get to see more of the love triangle with Peeta and Gale where it was not really apparent in the first book. Katniss has to figure out whom to trust and make a lot of decisions. I liked how throughout Katniss does not realize just how important she is and has become to everything she is standing for. This book shapes her into the leader that Panem needs.ant she is and has become to everything she is standing for. This book shapes her into the leader that Panem needs.

0393976041|5.0|Elizabeth Bennett is one of five unmarried daughters in the Bennett household and Mrs. Bennett is looking to change that. When wealthy bachelor, Mr. Bingley, arrives in town the opportunity arrives and Mrs. Bennett pounces matching him with her eldest daughter Jane. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy notices what is afoot and has some words with second in line Miss Elizabeth Bennett before striking up an unlikely attraction. As romance takes hold, drama unfolds.<br /><br />A beautifully well written classic for the romantic at heart. I had to read this book in high school and it was simply inspirational. Elizabeth is a well-rounded character displaying the flaws of having prejudices against Mr. Darcy who on the other hand has too much pride for his own good. The banter between the two is wonderful to read and quite witty.
006056251X|5.0|As the shyest wallflower in the group, Evangeline Jenner, makes an outrageous proposal of marriage to the most rebellious of rakes, Viscount St. Vincent, to escape her relatives her world is forever going to change. As Evie's conditions weight on Sebastian will he choose to risk his heart in this endeavor or run when things get too serious?<br /><br />I love how reader's have gotten to know Evie through everything as being the shyest among them yet she summons all of her courage to approach the most notorious rake there was. She was able to make herself stronger to escape her fate and fight for what she wants. Readers have also seen Lord St. Vincent in other works as the more evil out of everyone but in this work we are able to see another more endearing side to him. He found something to make him turn his world around, he wanted to protect Evie, and he wanted to be good for Evie. The chemistry between Evie and Sebastian was extraordinarily delightful to behold.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Missed an episode and didn't want to be confused amazon had it, good to know that you can find the ones you miss.

B00846REIS|5.0|A well written novel that is easy to read and enjoyable!  I would recommend it to anyone. If you liked 50 shades of grey, you will definately like this novel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was by far the best of the 3 books. Love the Fifty Shades Trilogy, but most especially Book Three....
B0066WJLU6|5.0|So many times when you're out running errands, you drop something and you need a flashlight to find it in the dark. You grab your phone flashlight and there it is.  Also, when attending concerts at the park in the evening and your walking back to your car having a flashlight helps you find your way and the car in the dark.
B0097VS7ZS|2.0|It's a great idea that was not well developed. Extremely difficult and often impossible to color in the very small spaces. I got this thinking it might be fun to do with my grandchildren but I see now that they would quickly grow frustrated with it, as did I.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|I've been a rabid Rush fan since I was a kid, but I admit, Rush has been an acquired taste for many listeners. This new album will definitely gain Rush  a wider fan base for sure!<br /><br />Favorite songs: Caravan, Clockwork Angels, The Garden.<br /><br />My wife, whom I love despite the fact that she hated Rush, after seeing them on the Clockwork Angels tour, and hearing this album, is now a FAN! :)<br /><br />A MUST listen. Rush rocks like no other band I know.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Edge of your seat! I absolutely love this show. The first was season was great, the second is even better.
B003ES61EE|5.0|Came very quickly and it works great. It was alil pricey for jst a lens cleaning pen i payed more then i wanted 2but i would say its worth it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|a fun and addictive game which will keep you endlessly entertained. i could play it all day long, again and again.
B0063M22QO|5.0|The game is easy for any one to play. It has great graphics and very clear image. It would help to have a bigger board and not tiles.
B0041O40EI|5.0|5 Stars because it is a puzzle that changes through time! Most puzzles....you build them once and you're done. This has great educational value as well.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I had been looking for this movie for a while, so I was thrilled when I finally found it.  It came in perfect condition, and came quickly.  I was so excited to finall watch it...I would definitely buy from them again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating for the quality. E L James has done a wonderful job on his second book!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I like this authot's Pillars of the Earth but I found Fall of Giants confusing. Too many countries ,too many characters/ I kept  losing track. I think that the book lacked focus and it did not expand my knowledge of this period. I got bogged down in it, Not Follett's best effort.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book reminded me of Monica Dickens who was Dickens' great grand daughter. She wrote great stuff about social work in English communities. Rowling really knows how to break the heart  when she deals with this subject. She brings it right up to date with how mean messages on the  Internet can dis rupt an entire community. The main focus is on a single mother and her children..If this doesn't make you keep, you have heart of stone. On the lighter side, her use of dialogue is superb.
B00190OHD6|5.0|There aren't very many movies I can watch more than once but this is one of them. I love the music, the location(s) where the movie is filmed, and also the story line which most peoples lives have weaved in and out of in real life.
B00493E1GI|2.0|The book is much better. The movie *could* have been amazing but I don't think Julia Roberts owned the character very well. Also the cheesy melodramatic music cheapened it a bit. The book was awesome though!
0307730697|5.0|I have to say that this was one of the most inspirational books I have ever read. Adam Brown's story is truly incredible on so many levels. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I've read another Eric Blehm's books and again, he does a wonderful job here.
B009CPES4I|4.0|Was looking for a fun family movie and this really delivered. Great characters, interesting cinematography. The while family enjoyed it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Awesome book.  The book was well written and hard to put down.  Chris tells the story in first person, and it was great to read his wife`s thought and feelings.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book the most out of the three. I was so happy when Peeta and Katniss ended up together. That made my day!
B000068OCS|3.0|How can I review something I never got. Why is this on my list to review.  Please revise this list.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|A friend told me about this book when I was frustrated about my weight. Since she doesn't carry much body fat, I decided to try it, and I've lost 10 pounds. I can't vouch for the science, but I do think that walking away from carbs, even whole grains, may be the secret to shedding pounds for me. When I lose another 10 pounds, I'm going to get my blood checked to see what it's done to my cholesterol level and other markers.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Based on Amazon reviews I thought this movie would be a superstar and it was just, well... good.  The story was a modification from the classic (no big deal), the actors were first choice (whatever), and the cinematography was pretty good (I'm no critic) but I just didn't get into it like I expected I would.  Perhaps I ate a bad meal before I watched it?
0307279189|4.0|I enjoyed the book.<br />I think the author was proned to exaggerate but it didn't detract too much from the message. The message I got was that running was a way to engage yourself in living, on a psychological, spiritual, and physical level. I don't think running makes you a good person, but what constitutes a good person anyway? Is it someone who faithfully plays &#34;follow-the-leader&#34; and keeps all the rules, or someone who follows their heart in a kind, compassionate sort of way, or dozens of other definitions. I think we can recognize a good person when we're in their presence even if we can't uniquely define one. Also, I find that competition becomes much less important as one gains more confidence in oneself, not as a player but as a person. When I bike I find it exciting to try to win but when the race is over I feel little disappointment about not winning and considerable satisfaction in just riding hard. It wasn't always like that and I'm not sure if age or enlightenment has made the difference.<br />As for the author's case on evolution I think he made some leaps in logic and I'm suspicious that he picked his evidence as it supported his case and ignored what didn't. Not going to research this because it wasn't critical to my perspective and I kind of enjoyed his presentation.<br />Finally, the book did make me want to run more and experiment with running styles.<br />THe book would have been a flop without the tarahumera.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I saw these guys in concert and they are just amazing! Now I can listen to their music in the car every morning. I just love how they put a new spin on old music and a traditional spin on new music. You will not be disappointed!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades...need I say anything else?!  A great &#34;ending&#34; to the trilogy...and a great lead in to the next &#34;series&#34;.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Part one is my fav. i couldnt put it down finished it a weekend. the 2nd was good but not as interesting to me as the first one and the third was great. i would say that i would rank the books 1-3-2 but the story itself it awesome i wish james would release a series on christians point of view
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd full of action and sci fi action, very good movie
B005D9MUWY|5.0|there are some messages I never have to &#34;type&#34; just choose words from the list!  I like the color skins they have as options
B0076DELIG|5.0|A typical Harry Bosch thriller.  Kept my interest throughout.  I have ever read a Michael Connelly book that I did not enjoy.  Hope he continues to keep them coming.  Bob D.
B008FRJ1IW|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the new marvel cinematic universe and this was an easy way to get thor cheaper than as a &#34;loose&#34; figure on other sites.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|I downloaded it and played it for a couple of levels and then deleted it. I thought it was very boring. there's nothing really to it. I would not recommend this to anyone. unless you don't already have a bubble game like this
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|not a big fan of the regular angry birds, but I really liked the &#34;Rio&#34; edition but the Star Wars is even better than that!  and they just release addtitional levels, also a great product marketing tie ins as well
B008G59IKO|5.0|After suffering through Uno, I was giving no hope that Dos would be any better.  To my huge surprise, Dos is really good.  I've listened to the CD now four times in the last two days.  This is the Green Day that was so completely missing in Uno.<br /><br />I really like the range of styles in this collection.  &#34;Stop When The Red Lights Flash&#34; reminds me of the great Insomniac cd.  &#34;Lazy Bones&#34; has a real funky drum beat that would have fit in nicely in the Nimrod cd.  &#34;Makeout Party&#34; has a really similar sound to American Idiot.  But, my favorite track is definitely &#34;Stray Heart&#34;.  &#34;Nightlife&#34; is something completely different than I have heard from them before.  I honestly like just about every song on this CD.  I think they could have left off &#34;F#$% Time&#34;, but this is classic Green Day where there is always one song on the CD where they just do and say anything they want, which is fine.<br /><br />I then thought maybe I was too critical of Uno, so I gave that yet another listen.  Result:  I stick by my rating uno is aweful except for 4 songs (First two and last two).<br /><br />Hopefully Tre will be more like this CD.
B0015FML06|5.0|As I said for the unforgettable album, I like the extras and I am a big U2 fan. I thought it was worth it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I bought this because everyone was talking about it.  The truth is, I got bored and haven't gotten past about page 80.  Not my type of book I guess.
B002JTHFUS|5.0|How could you not like this if you are a U2 fan? I wanted this for the extra tracks and while some were good others were so-so.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I read all of the other books without a problem.  I got slightly bored and didn't actually finish the last book.  Disappointed.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This was a very fun and easy game to play. Ages should be playing 5 years old and up. Our whole family liked it.
B005JR47R6|5.0|Graet actors, Every season was worth watching and buying. I would recommened this show to everyone. It's a must see kinda show.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I used this app for a really long time and I thought it was great, but then once I tried to open it, and it never loaded, it's been doing the same ever since. I'm definitely waiting for the new update so I can keep playing! I would recommend if you have a kindle to wait until the update comes out to download or purchase this, but once that happens, this is a great game and you should definitely try it and maybe purchase the ad-free version.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I've read several books, this one is a real thriller....fun to read and I could barely set the book down....
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|This was a heart wrenching (from a parent's view) film - but so joyous as you watched the interchange between Christopher and the people he met.  The ending was sad - a tear jerker.<br />I would watch it again.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This wonderful little film has been part of our family Christmas traditions for over 20 years; but the only copy we had was a grainy VHS tape recorded from the television.  My kids grew up loving this movie; and now that they have kids I wanted it to be a part of their Christmas tradition as well.  It is magical in its simplicity and evokes all the wonder, joy, and innocence that is part of the Christmas spirit.  I highly recommend it for anyone who has kids, grandkids, or great grandkids, or who is just a kid at heart.  It is a beautiful work of art.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I am very partial to British period films and was thrilled to see so many of my favorite English actors in a film. The story was wonderful and touching. It nice to think that love may find us no matter our age or circumstance. Purchased a copy for my Mom and can't wait to watch it again, with her. Highly reccomend.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is a must buy for any music lover who appreciates popular music in a classical format. All of the songs on the album are beautifully executed and take one to another world. I was ecstatic to receive my copy of ThePianoGuys album and have enjoyed it ever since. If you would like to hear a classical twist on popular songs of the day, you will not be disappointed! My favorites on the album are Beethoveen's 5 Secrets and A Thousand Years.
B0015AARJI|3.0|I get this Dualshock 3 for my ps3, I m still in doubt if this is 100% sony from the buyer because sometimes does not response fine with the system, besides that works fine
B008H6GHL0|5.0|This is a must get if you are a resident evil fan or even if you like zombies and action. got this just before RE6 come out.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|Overall, the movie is quite entertaining. Decent cinematography, good soundtrack. But the story itself gets a little over the top. I will note that I typically don't like violence in movies, so that probably has the most to do with my review. I thought the acting was good though, and it kept my attention the whole way through.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It has it all. Big enough, but not too big, have good place for my canon T3i and 2 lenses.<br />It is well desinged and is very functional for its purpose.
B009329Y30|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.  The writing and acting were better than I expected.  I usually don't go for mushy Nicholas Sparks stories, but I enjoyed this movie enough to watch it twice!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|One of the best Marvel Comics movies of all times.  A must have for the collector.  I've seen this at the movies 2 times.  Once in 3d and the second time in 2d.  Awesome movie.
B008JAGZDE|1.0|They should never have bothered making this movie.  The writing is awful, the acting was embarrassing, and it was a complete waste of time.  Luckily I waited until it was only $1.99 before renting it.
B001AIG41K|5.0|Very good southern rock CD enjoy listening to it very much, However their follow up to this CD is even better. Which is the way it should be as long as bands keep getting better and do not take a step backwards they are doing it the way it should be done keep on rockin' Whiskey Myers.. If you like great southern rock buy this CD and also Fire Water. You will not be disappointed. Can't wait for their next CD and to see them live.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|I had such great hopes for this movie because I enjoyed all of the previous \\"Bourne\\" movies. But this is a STINKER! The entire movie is running and chasing without any development of the characters or plot. What a waste of time!!!! Too bad, because I like the actors, but they really should have had some control of the script. This is nothing more that cashing in on previous movies - too bad.
B008J9EYFG|4.0|A far cry from her Central Reservation CD, i know the hard core fans still love it and excuse me for not  loving it but the songs are not as catchy or arranged as well as &#34;Central.&#34;. Her voice is still PERFECT and the writing is still very , very professional  and the recording production very top notch but I am the type to like the catchy songs. She's a wonderful songwriter and has the voice of an angel. Good CD ,hope it grows on me as I keep listening.
B00A0R42L6|5.0|Even though 3 years old (going on 24), she loves the graphics and humor of this movie. I as a parent enjoy the peace and quiet the movie provides me as I take a small 1.5 hour break from parenting ;-)<br />An excellent buy. All of the ICE AGE movies are very good, great graphics.
B002RI9ORI|4.0|The point is made that much about the invalidity of alternative medicine; uncontrolled pseudoscience; public figures who made a name with pretends.  Chapters are more repetitive of same points rather than categorizing with examples with these 'frauds'.  Arguing with non-professionals and quacks on scientific points often lowers the level of the professional himself/herself in the subject.
B000M5NRLC|5.0|How can anyone ever get tired of watching Jim Carrey's silly humor?  I mean seriously, he is a funny comedian that is worth watching over and over again.  Even my 3 yr old daugter reminds me to put on the Grinch movie.  If you have not seen this movie yet and need a good laugh, then at least rent it from Amazon. if you love Jim Carrey, then shame on your for not having this movie added to your Jim Carrey collection.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I read this book because it was recommended to me by a friend who shares similar taste in literature but I'm afraid I'm somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed takes you on her impulsive journey along the Pacific Crest Trail as an ignorant amateur in need of escape from \\"everything\\". The long and often silent stretches of hiking offered the author much needed time to reflect on her painful past, fraught with questionable and self-destructive life decisions, and to her credit, she manages to keep the reader engaged throughout these extended periods during her hike where nothing really happens by discussing the memories of her past very candidly. However, I definitely found the first half of the book more interesting than the second as I started to get bored by her trip and the problems she experienced because she didn't do the homework she should have done prior to taking on such an ambitious task.<br /><br />Although I think Strayed is a good writer, I just wasn't moved by her story. She had some interesting moments in Wild but on the whole, I kept thinking \\"what a stupid girl.\\" I found it difficult to relate to her personally at times despite the fact that I could relate to her loss and much of her anger. Although Strayed was unforgiving of herself and very honest about her short-comings and bad decisions, she just came across as a narcissistic and self-absorbed child who wanted a convenient excuse to be irresponsible and sleep around with random men which I often found myself shrugging at and saying \\"so what?\\"<br /><br />I appreciated how honest (often disparagingly so) Strayed was about herself but I couldn't help but question the truth of all aspects of her story. If the questionable parts made Wild more interesting, I wouldn't complain but they made me doubt her whole downward spiral, supposedly caused by her mother's death. I suspect that Strayed's life was already going awry and her mother's death was not what set her off on her dark path of self-destruction but it definitely provides a decent premise for a book on one's journey of self-discovery. Harsh, and I could be wrong of course, but that's my gut feeling nonetheless. The book was all so self-indulgent that by the ending, which was a very abrupt \\"let me tie it all up here to sound like I was healed by the time I was done\\", I was kind of relieved it was over.<br /><br />Strayed does a good job of relaying her chopped-up memoirs but I definitely did not feel she conveyed her \\"healing process\\" on her hike very well because there was no genuine introspection on her part and I struggled to see where she got her closure because I, the reader, didn't get any. Perhaps that's because there was a bit of a disconnect between the accounts of Strayed's past and those of her experiences on the trail. They didn't mesh well as they seemed like two different books thrown together rather haphazardly with Strayed using her mother's death as the link - a fragile one at that.<br /><br />Perhaps that was the angle she was working in her book and I just didn't get it but it felt like she missed the mark to me.<br /><br />On the whole, worth a read if you've got time to kill, but that's about it in my humble opinion.
B009YX02T8|5.0|What can I say? I'm a Twilight fan! I had to complete my collection of music from all the other movies.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It's been a joy following these guys and hearing the newest singles released. Having the album makes for a great study soundtrack with its variety and dynamic sound. Get the album and get excited.

B00A19Z75S|4.0|This is a fascinating look at the factors of success. It arrives at some pretty simple answers that somehow manage to elude most people's consideration. \\"Successful people don't do it alone\\" is his basic thesis. And, while I disagree with some of his inferences downstream, this is a thesis that I can agree with wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Gladwell looks at questions such as: Why is there a disproportional amount of professional hockey players born January, February, and March? Why have an amazingly high proportion of the richest people in the world come from a small time period? Why have the most profilic computer entrepreneurs come from a narrow range of birth years?<br /><br />He gives a thrilling ride through amazing \\"accidents\\" of a persons environment that predict success better than almost any other factor. Or are they \\"accidents\\"?  He concludes that they aren't accidents. \\"The outliers always have help along the way\\".<br /><br />So, this is a glowing review so far. I do, however, substantially disagree with the prescriptive suggestions Mr. Gladwell would put forward to try to resolve these factors and make them more equitable. Especially some of the elaborations he's given in interviews in connection to this book.<br /><br />I think Gladwell errs in underestimating the complexity of manipulating the factors of success. And he seems to blindly assume that through simple manipulations via government or community, the playing field can be leveled to a significant degree. He seems to ignore or downplay the  self-organizing aspect of how outliers come to be. He seems to dream that if you take the advantages the current outliers have and distribute them widely, outliers along other aspects would not quickly appear. Would he seriously maintain, to take the hockey example, that if you were able to take all the advantages players born in January thru March, and spread them equitably to all players, the situation would be more equitable? I think he maintains just that. And yet, in light of what we know about social organization, it seems to be an absurd conclusion.<br /><br />Outliers are, by definition, rare. Gladwell rightly observes, they are not, in the truest sense, self-made men. But even though they are not self-made men, they are scarce men. I believe Gladwell's prescriptions suffer from a downplaying of or ignoring the element of scarcity in the concept of an  \\"outlier\\". The existence of outliers presupposes scarcity. Not a zero sum game, but some element of<br />scarcity.<br /><br />If you try to organize a society in a way that takes the advantages that the outliers have and attempt to distribute them more equitably, you end up reducing the value, significance, and incentives of being an outlier in the first place. If you take the conditions that create  \\"outliers\\" and give them to everyone, those conditions will cease being a contributing factor to success and the \\"outliers\\" will begin to thrive on the distinctions given to them via different source.<br /><br />So, my assessment is that this is an excellent book. With great research presented in a compelling way. Just don't necessarily follow advice the author would give based on his research. Enjoy his presentation, but know that everything that comes afterwards doesn't necessarily follow. This is not the death blow to \\"rugged individualism\\" that Mr. Gladwell seems to claim it is.And yet, in light of what we know about social organization, it seems to be an absurd conclusion.<br /><br />Outliers are, by definition, rare.

0385738765|4.0|I didn't read the book myself. I bought it for my 14 year old daughter who says it was a very good book! She is waiting patiantly for the next book to come out.
0812992784|3.0|I don't know how to review this book. I did enjoy many aspects of it and it's far better than the detractors say. And yet, there some clear downsides too, and I found my opinion changing back and forth throughout the book.<br /><br />On the plus side, the book is really well written. And the subject is undeniably fascinating, portraying Rushdie's life under the fatwa instituted by Iran. \\"Joseph Anton\\" is Rushdie's alias when he goes into hiding. For that reason alone it's an important book in the history of free speech. And it is hard to image how one couldn't be at least mildly curious about what it would be like to be Salman Rushdie during the late 80's and early 90's.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are some strongly annoying aspects. I have a great deal of respect for Rushdie's talents and agree what he says about freedom of expression. And yet, even though I enjoyed the book overall, I found myself having less and less sympathy for him as a person.<br /><br />Rushdie often comes across as cranky, ungrateful at times, unfaithful, and engendering a strong sense of entitlement. Even though he is receiving constant protection, he seem ungrateful at times and cranky even about minor details.<br /><br />The entire book is written in the third person, which aids the narrative early on. However, eventually, through a lot of repetition, it sound more like an affectation. I also found that, even though the book is well-written, at times Rushdie is a little too wordy about incidental details which don't really move the story forward, and that bogs it down.<br /><br />Please, though, don't misunderstand this as being dismissive of the book or Rushdie's work in general. There is a fair amount of good in this book, but it deserves some measure of criticism. I hope my criticism doesn't eclipse the fact that, in some senses, this really was a fascinating read. To give an honest review, I must draw attention to some of the negatives. And so, while Rushdie is a monumental figure in the history of literary freedom, I'm not quite ready to call this a \\"great\\" memoir.gure in the history of literary freedom, I'm not quite ready to call this a \\"great\\" memoir.

B008G59IBI|4.0|\\"&iexcl;Tre!\\" Is the final of the trilogy by Green Day begun by September's \\"&iexcl;Uno!\\", and it opens with the delightful retro ballad \\"Brutal Love\\" with jangly guitars, fleeting horns and a tinge of Soul and Doo Wop, followed by a pair of perfunctory rockers \\"Missing You\\": and \\"8th Avenue Serenade\\" which while not bad never quite rise above the ordinary. \\"Drama Queen\\" is another nice ballad with a retro feel, followed by the upbeat \\"X-Kid\\" which is just okay.<br /><br />\\"Sex, Drugs & Violence\\" regains the zest and vigour missing from the earlier rockers and sounds more like Green Day. From here on, the band sound rejuvenated; \\"Little Boy Named Train\\", \\"Amanda\\", \\"Walk Away\\" (with an interesting key change in the final minute), and the 6 minute musical suite \\"Dirty Rotten Bastards\\" (with some great guitar solos). \\"99 Revolutions\\" is frenetic paced, while closing is the theatrical piano/string ballad \\"The Forgotten\\" which featured on the soundtrack \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2\\". Nothing revolutionary, but not bad at all!

B009IRVSVQ|4.0|For his sophomore album, Bruno Mars mines a wide sonic palette; Soul, Disco, Reggae, Electronica, Pop, hence the title \\"Unorthodox Jukebox\\". The album sounds retro and classic all at the same time.<br /><br />Lead-off single \\"Locked Out Of Heaven\\" is a frenetic piece of Pop with yelping vocals, hints of the Police and adorned with horns and grunts. \\"Treasure\\" is a Funk/Disco number with rapid-fire vocals recalling Jamiroquai. The groovy Disco \\"Moonshine\\" channels Michael Jackson, while the gorgeous piano ballad \\"When I was Your Man\\" recalls Elton John's \\"Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word\\", with Mars hoping his girl's (whom he obviously hasn't gotten over) new beau treats her very well. \\"My heart breaks a little when I hear your name\\" he sings.<br /><br />The bouncy \\"Natalie\\" builds to an irresistible chorus. \\"Show Me\\" is Reggae with deep bass, quivery effects and oddly recalls Musical Youth's \\"Pass the Dutchie\\" in places. The menacing \\"Money Make Her Smile\\" builds to a frenetic chorus, while closing is the Motown-esque Doo wop ballad \\"If I Knew\\". With all these references to other artistes, this could easily have come off as pastiche, but Mars is a talented songwriter and singer whose personality shines through, making this a winner.

B004LWZWGA|2.0|Left with the impression that I missed something in the midnight screening of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" after rave reviews from critics and die hards opposed my initial thoughts, I knew I would have to watch it again to form a solid opinion. Then the movie theater massacre happened in Colorado and my second viewing got post-poned... indefinitely.<br /><br />After a Black Friday shopping spree led to the purchase of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" DVD for $13, my chance arrived yet again. And yet again, I've been let down. \\"The Dark Knight Rises,\\" like \\"Spider-Man 3,\\" is a trilogy clunker that coasts on the belief that bigger is better.<br /><br />The problems are still there, two viewings in: Christopher Nolan expands the cast to include characters that are too quickly introduced and too focused on for us to care. Peter Foley (played by weakest link, Matthew Modine), Miranda Tate (the \\"written strictly for the third act character\\" played by Marion Cotillard), and John Blake (a Joseph Gordon-Levitt, whose assumption that Bruce Wayne is Batman is so ludicrous it lingers for the remaining two hours and causes us to wonder if he knows that Batman is actually Christian Bale) are generally unwelcomed additions to a story that's thinner than what its weaver hopes we think it isn't. This is \\"Batman Begins\\" all over again, only it attempts a loftier reach for epicness that inadvertently causes it to be the most cartoonish in Nolan's desperate-to-be- realistic franchise.<br /><br />The only new character given justice is Selina Kyle, who, as played by Anne Hathaway, is too underused for how good she is.<br /><br />Even at 165 minutes, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" feels like a rushed effort. Scenes transition into others like a contestant at a hot dog eating contest waits to digest his next wiener. The pacing is fast, but the result is not edge-of-your-seat inducing. It's messy. And rarely anything more.<br /><br />On top of the bloated pretentiousness, \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" sound-editing is atrocious. Between Howard Shore's score and Bane's Sean Connery impersonation, the mute dialogue featured in \\"The Artist\\" resounds as more audible. Not only does \\"Rises\\" adopt the motif that bigger is better, but also louder, and it's all to its disadvantage.<br /><br />As the conclusion to a trilogy, \\"Rises\\" should have been more intimate than special-effects ridden. Scenes showing \\"The Bat\\" dodging missiles lack suspense, compared to the ones wherein Bruce Wayne encounters Selina Kyle at a charity ball. And while the level of talent involved cannot be denied, their use can. I thought \\"The Dark Knight\\" was a comic book masterpiece and I think a lot of others are confusing its affiliation with this picture to mean the same. Not so. \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is smoke and mirrors. A motion picture that deserved better from the expectations set by its own creator.<br /><br />FINAL SCORE: Cis atrocious.

B00A0NOF7G|3.0|This was a good cozy mystery.  The editing could be a bit better, but the story itself was pretty good for being so short. The story had a little mystery and a little romance which is right up my alley. The middle to the end of the story was very predictable and a bit corny, but I like that from time to time in a cozy mystery. This was well worth the free download.

0062020897|5.0|I read this book ages ago, when still a teenager, and recently I was happy to discover, that \\"The eye of the needle\\" really didn't age at all. This fast paced and quite violent story is about the last German spy still operating in 1944 in Great Britain. Although this is pure fiction, it is a very good read, as the author did his best to make the story stick to the reality of WWII. The \\"hero\\" of the book is a very bad guy, but it is impossible not to feel at least a little for him, as he is trying to escape the tightening noose, with a vital piece of information - he is totally alone, very far from home, in a totally hostile place and faces certain death at the slightest mistake or weakness. The way in which he deals with all the adversities forces some respect. His final fate is very surprising and gives this novel a flavour rarely seen in spy stories. This is a really good book for holidays or a long rainy weekend -I enjoyed it mightily. Ken Follett wrote some good spy novels later - but this is his first and best, no argument there.

B000DWMYQ8|5.0|I really liked this movie, and, what is even more important, my daughter liked it too.<br /><br />It is a really sweet history about a little guy (Chicken Little), half-orphaned, being raised by a very caring and loving but just a little overhelmed dad (Buck Cluck). Being little and wearing big glasses he is of course the dreamed target of class bullies, but - as it is usual with the nerds - he has a bunch of friends between other oucasts: a really ugly duck girl (Ugly Duckling), a really obese, asthma ridden pig (Runt of the Litter) and a foreign exchange student, totally fearless, always happy, but just a little... odd (Fish out of Water). And let it be said - this is one of the most likeable and bravest bunch of \\"losers\\" I ever saw.<br /><br />The life of the little town and the life of a little town school are described in a great way. The mayor, the local newsman (emh, in fact a newsdog), the coach, the class bully and her sidekick - a great gallery of hilarious personages. The baseball match is one of the greatest moments in kids movies I ever saw. And once the aliens appear... it is a delight. And once the REAL aliens appear - the movie gets even better.<br /><br />We got it on DVD and we already finished the game on Game Cube. And we both wait for the (possible) sequel.

B00000JPH6|5.0|This is one of the sweetest and most delightful fantasy movies ever made. It was made mainly for the young public, but I must confess, that although being now in the second half of my life, I still cherish this movie greatly.<br /><br />So - here, instead of a barrel chested half-naked barbarian, the main hero is Jen, a Gelfling, a pixish diminutive being with delicate face, orphaned in his early childhood and raised by a race of benevolent ancient creatures, the Mystics. One day, when Jen is already a young adult, he is told, that he was chosen to accomplish a great mission - he is the one and the only one who can save the world...<br /><br />Begins an incredibly perilous journey, during which he will meet a fair maiden Gelfling, find a magic item of major importance, face monsters and traitors and ultimately go to the fortress of evil, where dwells hideous Skeksis... who are desperate to catch Jen, but really not to hug him...<br /><br />Well, this is the same story we all saw already dozens of time - but this one has some unique features. First - all the characters are puppets, marionettes, etc. and still look really great, even in our time of CG special effects. The music is very impressive. The vision of the world is totally unique - nothing familiar for us, Earthlings, it is clear that this story is happening long time ago, in a galaxy far far away...<br /><br />The girl Gelfling is possibly one of the sweetest creatures I ever saw - she is clearly a fairy princess (and she will prove it at a moment in the movie). Jen is a very kind and quiet hero, but definitely not a whimp - and his noble attitude will impress the most hardened hearts... In one word, this movie is a monument of cinema! See it with your kid, with your date or with your dog and a beer - but see it you must!

1416585710|5.0|This most excellent book is the real come back of this great writer after the (short) period of less inspired writing (2005-2007) and it is also one of most successful continuations of stories written long time ago by the Great Master of modern horror - H.P. Lovecraft himself.<br /><br />Concerning the first point, let's just remember that in 2005 was published the \\"Dark Tower\\", seventh and last installment in the magnificent saga King was writing since early 70s. It was in my modest opinion his highest achievement (if we except \\"Pet Sematary\\" which is still my greatest favourite) and the amount of work it needed certainly took its toll on the writer. I was very afraid that his next works would be lesser in quality and if \\"Colorado Kid\\" was still very honest, \\"Cell\\" was a disappointment. So it is with a heavy heart that I opened \\"Lisey's Story\\" - and I was very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />With this book clearly Stephen King is back, with his infantry, cavalry, artillery and train. Not only this book is great but it is also one of the best he ever wrote. Some of the reviewers below complained about its slow start and this is correct. This book starts very slow, but I believe this is deliberate - the story is after all about a grieving widow (Lisey), who, two years after the sudden and painful death of her husband, is still shellshocked. In fact in the very first pages she just managed to collect herself enough to start cleaning the office of her late husband.... and this will lead to all the other events described in the book. So, please, be patient with \\"Lisey's Story\\". It MUST start slow and it DOES start slow. But if you persevere (about 150 pages) your patience will be rewarded - and you will suddenly see those first pages in a totally different light.<br /><br />The great achievement of Stephen King is to offer us a book which is in fact a perfect mix of two stories. If we cut all the supernatural elements, we still obtain a very good short novel about memories of a happy past and the present grief. The fantastic part of the book, once added to it, is a very well written, very dark and extremely interesting story in large part inspired by Lovecraft.<br /><br />Influences of Lovecraft are visible in some of King's books - the most direct are present in some of his earliest short stories, when in the later books they became more discreet but even better. For exemple we have a short vision of Ithaca in \\"Pet Sematary\\" and in a very King-esque joke, the devil in \\"Needful Things\\" says that he got his car in the high country of Leng... Here Lovecraftian influence is much more present but still in a very discreet manner - do not expect any \\"Necronomicon\\" findings, and there will be no \\"Ia! Cthulhu fhtagn!\\" every two pages. Instead, we have the atmosphere of Lovecraft books and some of his creatures, which are (typically for King) called with childish names, as one of the characters met them as a child and still calls them with names which he gave to them in this time. There are the laughers, the \\"bad gunky\\" (which we do not see other than in its effects) and especially the \\"longboy\\", who, I believe, is actually one of the Great Ancients (considering his size and power).<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed this book, but I agree it is not easy to read - also, it tells a story of a woman in her fifties, so it is not recommended for the teenagers. They will probably not understand fully what it means to be in a long (and childless) marriage and then stay alone... with just the grief, the memories of happy past, some dark secrets from the past and a perspective of lonely old age...ries of a happy past and the present grief.

B000TM1CL0|4.0|\\"Shark\\" is a very original serie about a highly successful and really mean lawyer, Sebastian Stark (James Woods), who made a fortune and humiliated virtually every assistant district attorney in LA defending the most evil and despicable (but always very rich) criminals. His agressiveness and lack of scrupules earned him the nickname \\"Shark\\". But one day he has a conscience crisis (well, this is just a TV show, so I guess everything is possible...) and accepts to become an assistant district attorney himself, leading a High Profile Crimes Unit in Los Angeles. He finds himself under the orders of DA Jessica Devlin (magnificent Jeri Ryan), who suffered her share of humilaiting defeats against him - and gave him for this new unit a team of young, unexperienced (and not always very bright) ADA's.<br /><br />The team members are:<br /><br />- ADA Raina Troy (Sophina Brown), highly idealistic young black woman, who openly despises Stark but being very disciplined and unwilling to transfer stays loyal and obeys orders. Raina is hard working, methodical, calm and reserved - but her antipathy for her boss puts her good manners to a hard trial. Stark likes to shock and tease her, but respects her the most. She is the main stability pillar of the team.<br /><br />- ADA Casey Woodland (Samuel Page), a young white man, very handsome, born with a silver spoon in his mouth (his dad is a very rich and very prominent politician), he actually doesn't have to work if he doesn't want to - but clearly he got the virus of prosecution and he likes his job. He is very self confident (even arrogant), which makes him less than popular with other team members, especially Raina and Martin Allende... Stark just loves sending him curveballs and pointing at his mistakes, but he appreciates his aggressivity.<br /><br />- ADA Martin Allende - the youngest and the most delicate team member, is a young Latino guy, the first in his family to go to college and perceiving his work as a mission to help people and the whole society. He is even more idealistic than Raina (to the point of being naive) and working with Stark is a big challenge for him. Stark and Casey made a bet early in the series about his sexual orientation (Stark betting he is straight, Casey arguing he must be gay) and we know the answer just in the middle if the series.<br /><br />- last but definitely not least - ADA Madeline Poe (Sarah Carter, a jaw dropping beauty) - the most interesting (and the most gorgeous) team member is a hyper ambitious, totally cynical and ultra smart young woman, who asked to work with Stark to learn from the best in the trade. Contrary to Raina and Martin, she simply loves Stark's style and is as ready to play dirty as him - and even one better. She wants to be elected DA before being 40 (like Jessica Devlin, her other role model) and is ready to fight, cheat, lie and kill for it. Her intimate life will probably surprise even the most hardened TV viewers... With Stark himself this is the best character in the series.<br /><br />The cases treated by the team are mostly interesting, mostly important enough to attract the attention of Manuel Delgado, Mayor of Los Angeles (Carlos Gomez, great second role) himself. Mayor Delgado is also Stark's poker partner, at least once in a week... which comes handy from time to time.<br /><br />James Woods is of course the reason to watch this series and he really gives a great performance. His characer is so arrogant, mean, aggressive, cynical, that this is a pleasure to watch - especially considering that all this venom is directed against the evil doers (and most of the criminals are really really bad, and even worse, mostly they are rich...).<br /><br />However, even with all those good points, the series just fall short of a masterpiece. The reason is, I believe, that the creators of the series get scared by their own courage and simply didn't follow the logic to the end. Sebastian Stark is supposed to be a bad, arrogant, cynicalperson, treating people mainly as source of income and/or entertainement - and every time he could REALLY act his part, the screenplay holds him back or even makes him go backwards. We are supposed to believe, that a man, who defended the worse kind of people, earning big money and trashing victims, witnesses, policemen and prosecutors for nearly 30 years actually never used the services of a call girl when defending all the madams of LA(\\"I just represented them\\")?

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Every track its great. Definitively ThePianoGuys add its great touch and transform an already great music in a greatest one. I enjoy listening their music, everytime I play, is like listening for the first time.<br /><br />  Well done!!!
B009KHCT94|3.0|This movie was okay. It was entertaining, on a purely, \\"wow this is different\\" note. You really have to ignore any and all science, however, to watch it to enjoy it. The special effects are fairly well rendered. The tone and pace are pretty constant and it's pretty funny if you don't take racial, gender, and political jabs too personally. If you're sensitive to jabs on these fronts, prepare to be offended. If you're a Sarah Palin fan you're going to be annoyed. I don't see any way around that.<br /><br />Watch it with all this in mind for a laugh, not to analyze, and you'll probably enjoy it.

0307592731|5.0|A member of our book club was determined that this book should be titled 'Hike' since she talked on & on about the trail experience ... But I expected that. What I didn't expect were the side stories, the bare it all reality of her life experiences. Personally I loved it, I loved this book and her sense of humor.  Her honesty and her attitude.<br /><br /> I was so afraid for her when that creepy hunter came back. And another time  I was transported back to the day Jerry died and my own experience at that time & vivid memories.<br /><br />Maybe because we live in the mountains, many women here thought her lack of hiking knowledge was pathetic, but I thought it was hilarious & was glad she just went for it! I was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed this book so much.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|One of the most riveting shows on tv. Its almost addictive. Once you start the series you can't stop. Started watching season 2 on Showtime but couldn't get the entire storyline so stopped and purchased Season 1 to catch up. We were staying up into the middle of the night watching each episode. Highly recommended for anyone who watches TV.
0345803485|1.0|I picked this book up because I wanted to see what the fuss was all about.  I'm sorry I bothered.  I'm going to have plenty of spoilers in this review, so don't read it if you plan to read the book.  That being said, I recommend you invest your time somewhere other than this story.<br /><br />1) The writing is awful.  The author could have used a thesaurus and a decent editor.  The pacing was stilted and obvious.  The \\"plot\\" was nothing more than an excuse to move from one Penthouse Forum letter to the next.  It is pretty clear that the point of this book was the sex scenes.  The rest of it was filler.<br /><br />2) Speaking of those sex scenes... So we've got a naive girl and a controlling, obviously damaged rich guy.  Look, I'm all for a bit of smut in my stories, but this wasn't hot; it was disturbing.  Take away the physical aspects of the sex scenes, and what you have is basically manipulation and abuse.  Sure, the author tries to give us a reason for Grey's issues, and she attempts to make him a sympathetic character who is \\"learning to love\\".  But really.  If Ana was your daughter, would you encourage this relationship?  He's a stalker and a controlling ass.  She's being emotionally abused, and she's too young and enamored to walk away.  What is hot about that?<br /><br />3) If you do decide to read this book, I implore you... if you're a young woman (or man), this isn't how relationships are supposed to go.  Grey isn't a good guy.  This is not the relationship that you dream of.  If you want an adventurous sex life then good for you.  I'm all for it.  Just do it on your own terms and at your own pace.  Don't let some controlling, manipulative jerk push you into something that you're not ready for.  Shame on the author for trying to make emotional abuse look sexy.<br /><br />I won't be reading the other two books of this series.  I've got better things to do with my time, and there are much better authors out there who deserve my time and money.
0345803485|5.0|This book is like porn for women. Don't expect to be mentally stimulated, this is no Nobel prize, but worth reading if you would like to let your mind escape from everyday stresses.... Not for women who need to have control in relationships.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is the coolest of both all of DC's and Marvel's previous Superhero movies. My favorite Superhero has always been the Hulk, and the CGI Hulk looks awesome, and more realistic than the CGI Hulk in the earlier  movie &#34;The Incredible Hulk&#34;. The CGI Hulk in the Avengers even looks slightly better than the even earlier movie &#34;Hulk&#34;. The Hulk's pants looks more realistic in The Avengers and doesn't have a painted on appearance. That's the only thing I see that's better CGI than that of &#34;Hulk&#34;. The Avengers is an awesome movie.

Michael Myers is my all time favorite escaped slasher/ escaped mental patient. The original unstoppable boogieman, before Freddy, before Jason.

030758836X|5.0|Nick and Amy Dunne are all set to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary at their rented mansion on the Mississipi River, when Amy disappears without a trace. Where has this beauiful and clever girl gone, and why does Nick, supposedly a devoted husband, tell so many lies to the police, fabrications he's soon caught up in? However, Nick continues to declare his innocense, even though he admits to having a teen-age mistress, but as the weeks drag on with no sign of the elusive Amy, things look bad for the town's once-golden boy. Cleverly told from the characters' different points of view, in chapter after chapter, we soon realize this is a marriage straight from hell. The result is a book that is not only darkly wild and intriguing, but nasty and downright creepy at times--yet you can't stop reading! Could Nick, in spite of his weaknesses, really be a killer, and could charming Amy possibly be mad, as well as evil? I haven't read many books that really scared me, but when I finished this one I realized I'd just met a writer who's a master of mystery and suspense. Great job!

B005LAIIDU|5.0|Wreck-It Ralph is not a movie about a video game, at least not an existing video game.  It is a movie in the fashion of Tron, a movie about the hidden world inside video games.<br /><br />Here is the premise:  Ralph is the heavy in a game called Fix-It Felix, a fictitious Donkey Kong-era arcade classic built into a coin-op cabinet that looks almost exactly like a Donkey Kong machine.<br /><br />Ralph, sensitively voiced by John C. Reily (probably best known as Will Ferrell's sidekick in Step Brothers and Talladega Nights), is tired of life as a bad guy.  As the movie begins, he confesses this  in a support group for game villains called Badanon.  Other members of the group include such video game luminaries as Kano (Mortal Kombat), Satan (Diablo), M Bison (Street Fighter II), Zangief (Street Fighter II), Doctor Ivo Robotnick (Sonic The Hedgehog), and Bowzer (Super Mario Bros).  The leading the discussion is Clyde, the orange ghost from Pac-Man.<br /><br />Classic game character cameos abound in Wreck-it Ralph.<br /><br />The place where video game characters go to socialize in this arcade is Tapper's, the bar from the Midway game Root Beer Tapper.  (For the sake of Disney audiences, the bar did not have the big Budweiser logo scene in the original version of the game, which was simply named, Tapper.  Good call, Disney.)<br /><br />Feeling particularly perplexed on the thirtieth anniversary of his game, Ralph would like to have people root for him for a change. Hoping to find a little solace, he decides to embark on a quest for a medal to prove he is not such an awful guy--a quest which will take him into dangerous new locales such as Hero's Duty, a game that combines the shooter-on-rails action of Time Crisis, with the art direction of Gears of War, and the monsters of Alien--an amalgam shooting game in which players enter a bleak world killing futuristic bugs.<br /><br />While in Hero's Duty, Ralph meets Calhoun, the meanest, toughest-talking she-soldier in the history of video games--brilliantly voiced by Jane Lynch of Glee fame.<br /><br />After his tour in Hero's Duty, Ralph visits the ultra sweet world of Sugar Rush, which is sort of Mario Kart set in Candyland.  There, he meets Vanellope, voiced brilliantly by Sarah Silverman, who, as a programming glitch, is shunned by the other characters in her game.<br /><br />He's a bad guy; she's a misfit, you can see the chemistry bonding a mile away... and no one handles these relationships as well as Disney.<br /><br />We'll leave the plot unspoiled from here.<br /><br />The obvious question that comes up is, \\"Is Wreck-It Ralph a movie for video game players.  The answer is, \\"Yes and No.\\"  When it comes to cameos and references, the folks at Disney did NOT pull out all the stops.  There are lots and lots of game characters to spot--particularly in the arcade's electrical hub and along the wall of Tapper's; but the people who made this game did not go overboard.  They kept the story first and foremost, then let squeezed in game trivia whenever they cold.<br /><br />One of my favorite little trivia doffs was Mr. Litwak, the arcade owner.  A soft-spoken man dressed in an NFL Ref's shirt, he was clearly inspired by Walter Day, the world's most famous arcade owner and game record historian?  (Litwak--Waltir, I know, not a perfect anagram but close.)<br /><br />But you do not need to know about Walter Day or games like Road Blasters and Donkey Kong to fall in love with this perfectly executed, heart-warming, imaginative look into the secret life of video games.

1419705849|5.0|We would recommend this book to any family.  Parents, you'll love it because your middle school fears will be in flashback, kids love it because it's their worst school fears in paper back form. Fun for the entire family! Whalla, family time that they all will want to join in.

B005MMYPIE|5.0|O.K. I just got this yesterday.  I am 46 and have listened to the hard rock/metal genre since I was in high school.  This is without question one of the best albums I have ever heard.  Elize has an incredible voice.  The additional vocalists compliment her very well.  The guitar work is fantastic and the drums are equally great.  I recently got into the whole Euro rock/metal/pop rock scene.  I have bought albums from Nemesea, Delain, Within Temptation, and now Amaranthe.  This is my favorite to date.  Like another reviewer said...I can't wait for their next one!!!!!  I do have one wish...that they would come to America to do some shows.  I would go see them without question.  Buy this album...you will love it!!!!!

B008AK8FHM|3.0|I appreciate all the passion and strong faith feelings that went into writing this book.  There were many times when I was drawn in the story only to be distracted by a side story of something else.  I would have like to read more of just the 'after life' in at least one chapter without a distraction of something else going on at the same time.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Look, I can remember many good movies from my youth like West World and Blade Runner that are set in a future world of mankind gone wrong...but this one...is really troubling. Without giving away the whole movie, I recommend it, but NOT FOR CHILDREN.

030758836X|4.0|I did not think I would like this book. Every indication in reviews suggested that it was merely the bizarre phenomenon of chick-lit diverted into horror-suspense turned yet another notch higher with Grisham-like plotting and characters. A potent stew, yes, but hardly a literary breakthrough. Nonetheless, I was intrigued by the mention of its possible insights into relationships gone bad and made curious by its obvious popularity.<br /><br />I won't get much into the credibility of the plot twists or the book's adherence to police procedure. Suffice to say that despite the difficulty of some of the text's proposed deceptions, enough was there to me, as a crime novel dabbler, to allow me to suspend disbelief long enough to allow the author's magic to seem realistic enough.<br /><br />What I never expected was the book's insightful social context:<br /><br />1) The best fictional descriptions I have yet seen of the appalling social consequences of a generation-long destruction of the American middle class. The book is contemporary Dickens in this regard.<br /><br />2) A frank admission of how contemporary rational egoism, the economics of domestic life, the near-universal disregard for loyalty, and the obsession with personal power and revenge within relationships has corroded the institution of mixed-gender marriage to the point that many of those beyond youth without a blind religious commitment to marriage seriously doubt its viability or utility. Few pastors, divorce lawyers, or counselors will fail to recognize the dynamics at work in the text.<br /><br />3) A plea by Gen X and Y that they have been harmed, yes really harmed, by Boomer parents' use and manipulation of their children for their personal purposes - of the their failure to distinguish their children's needs from their own. Implicit in the critique is that the parental modeling has been so effective that it is now entwined in the psyches of X/Y parents, and in X/Y behavior towards their own children and parents.  As a Boomer parent, I am struck by how little concern children now have for the fates of their own parents. It's not merely an issue of \\"disrespect.\\"<br /><br />4) A not-so-subtle explication of the blue-red cultural divide within American white society. Credit the author with realizing that neither side has insight into its intolerance and misunderstanding. Credit the author further for realizing that not a little of this has to do with macroeconomics.<br /><br />5) A good, but not unique, display of how media-driven public opinion creates its own facts and realities. However, there is a particularly poignant monologue at one point where a character engages in serious self-doubt as to the reality of personhood in the face of a generational upbringing in which media realities are the realities of ordinary life, to the extent that learned responses to media pseudo-realities now constitute the ordinary activities of daily living.<br /><br />6) The extent to which some people are now willing to engage in large-scale public deception, and not merely for some specific limited goal or personal protection - but merely for the pleasure of doing it. In other words, the sociopath's radical lack of empathy and honesty has become somewhat socially normalized.  This revelation is chilling, and I think not a little part of the residual uneasiness the book leaves.<br /><br />7) Finally, the books asks to what extent madness, immorality, and ordinary human desires merge. At no point does that little bell go off in the head of a major character that sincerely is supposed to say, \\"Hey, something is really wrong about behaving this way.\\" Are most people simply weak-minded and mistake-prone but basically good people? Or is something much more sinister going on society-wide?<br /><br />But, oh, if you want to ignore all that, the book really is an engaging all-night read!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This review is for the Kindle edition ebook.<br /><br />Wow! Fast action, excitement, computer games, and war with aliens on another planet.<br /><br />This is a story of a battle to save the earth. It allows a simple computer game to be used to train children to become great leaders. To be trained properly, the children begin at a very young age. Of course, there are psychological scars left by this training.<br /><br />The use of computer games to train the young soldiers appears to be ideal in this story. In today's technology driven world that we live in, this could easily be our future. We are stretching out farther and farther into space. We are discovering other galaxies, solar systems, and planets faster the mind can imagine them. Why could not an alien race decide to attack our planet?<br /><br />This is a very entertaining book. It was able to grab hold of my imagination and hang on. Even after finishing the story, I find myself trying to imagine what life would have been like in this universe described in the story. Could I ever do what Ender did? Perhaps I could, and perhaps not. I will never know except through this author and his writings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone that really likes science fiction. I would also recommend it to those who claim to hate science fiction, because I think they would enjoy the book. I have already purchased \\"Speaker for the Dead\\", by this same author, which is the follow-up to this book. I need to find out what the future holds for Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin.
0385535147|5.0|This had to be one of the best John Grisham books to date ! Each story gets better and better with lots of intrigue and surprise's. Only a very clever mind could have written such a perfect novel with details that all seemed to come together. It was a bit of a fantasy story where one finds themselves pulling for the underdogs, but in this case it was a very refreshing approach. Max and Vanessa were definitely a dynamic duo who planned and executed a bizarre plot which also required great luck and timing. It was a nail biter from start to finish. The narrative style of story telling was perfect. (it helped me read between the lines as the story developed). I can't recommend this book enough ! As is often the case, I wish that there was a sequel as I would be quite curious to see how Vanessa, Max aka Malcolm, and the brothers enjoyed their lives in Antigua. Needless to say, I had many vicarious thoughts of what I would have done had I been fortunate enough to have been in their circumstances. Great Book ! Great Story ! Great Author ! Over the top entertainment from cover to cover !

B002RVZV9U|5.0|I normally just watch a blu-ray or video once on Netflix and I'm done with it. Very rarely does one come around that I actually want to own — It Might Get Loud is now in my library.<br /><br />And intimate get-together with three of the most unique guitarists around discussing... well, the guitar. What it means to them, how they get their sound, how they recorded, why they do what they do with it.<br /><br />The juxtaposition of these three mean is remarkable. Jack White recaptures the love of his old equipment and discusses why it was valid then and how it's valid now. The Edge with his wall of delays, distortions and modulators — looking for that elusive sound that will create the next U2 hit. And the old man himself, Jimmy Page showing you his guitars, his record collection, the old house where Zeppelin recorded.<br /><br />There's a moment when all three are chatting and Jimmy stands up, picks up his Les Paul and begins slicing out the riff to Whole Lotta Love and you see Jack and the Edge just staring like two thunderstruck school boys as their idol gives them a private lesson.<br /><br />There's a panel discussion after the documentary that opens up a lot to what you just saw and well worth the view.<br /><br />Can't recommend this any higher.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Thanks Piano Guys for a great album. Love the mix of classical and modern music<br />Bourne Vivaldi is my favorite!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I LOVE AMAZON MP3 PRODUCT .<br /> I Download mp3's from Amazon.  This is a free product to download to help store my music  & retreive it later for use on other computers or devices like my Android phone.  I can even transfer my music from my cloud player to my device.  I can't compare it to other similar products, because this is my first product I use to download & store my music.  I am a beginner, but it's easy to use. I have lost music on my computer, but i was able to log on to amazon site, sign in & reteive music from past & future purchases.  I plan to continue using this product.  THANKS AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|it is a great challenge. my brother and I try to beat it together. great time consumer. a must get!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|You would be hard pressed to find music more versatile, more uplifting, and more moving than this album by the Piano Guys. There are songs for everyone and every day on this albums. It's worth every penny to add this to your music collection, and you would be blessing the lives of anyone you gave it to. :)

1475143389|5.0|I read the book and am trying the six's style to see what happens before the summer season cut. So far so good. I would argue that there is a place for variation in the gym and not just stick to the same lifts again and again. I believe that muscle confusion has place in a longterm work regime.... I learn from every good book that I pick up and this no exception. Worth the bucks for sure.
B0090EIILU|3.0|Good for a laugh and if you're familiar with his other movies you should expect about the same. From what I remember this movie had less male genitalia than others, but was not totally devoid of it.
B005LAII62|5.0|GREAT FAMILY MOVIE.ENJOYED WATCHING OVER THE HOLIDAYS. FUNNY AND GREAT FOR ALL AGES. WILL WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN. LOVE IT.
1400032717|5.0|You have to wonder how the author of this book is not autistic himself.  I guess he has had enough experience around autistic children to understand well what's in their heads.  As a mom of an autistc toddler it was a great insight of how they break things down in this world and I think it will help me help her.  As a plain reader, this was just a great story!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Fun game to kill time. Really encourages you to buy coins huh but they are not needed. Its freemium so if you know that structure you get what the game is about.<br /><br />Very fun gameplay played it all the time on iphone. Wish it was more interactive but its just a racing game until it goes too fast to handle. Amazon released it for android so download it and enjoy it for what it is..not what it could be

B009PLKPMS|4.0|The problem I had with their first greatest hits was it came just three years after their debut meaning the songs were few and far between and too inconsistent between great and poor. This second greatest hits arrives a more timely eight years after their breakout year (2004) and shows a more balanced and consistent set of songs with more variation in sounds and style.<br /><br />McFly were always going to be one of the biggest boybands in Britain as labelmates Busted split up the management already had McFly primed waiting in the wings and not before being hugely endorsed to the Busted fanbase from the members themselves as they exited the pop world. So it's no surprise when McFly came along and went straight to the top with their debut single and then followed that up.<br />McFly had no real rivals during their chart topping years 04 to 07 as Westlife only added twice to their tally once in 05 and then in 06 and before McFly finished 2007 and put out volume 1 greatest hits they were on and remain on 7 UK #1 singles and all seven of those are featured on this album including their greatest effort in my eyes 'The Heart Never Lies'. McFly sporadically come up with top 10 hits these days and that's all they can ask for now as the boyband train has moved onto JLS, One Direction and The Wanted. They currently have 18 UK top ten singles.<br /><br />Glad 'POV' was put in on disc 2 and a good round up of their work, who would have thought they'd be on vol 2!<br />For me their greatest track remains 'The Heart Never Lies' but 'Love Is Easy', 'Shine a Light', 'Party Girl','Star Girl','One For The Radio','Friday Night','Obviously','All About You' and 'Lies' were liked also. The group also starred alongside Lindsay Lohan in the 2006 movie 'Just My Luck' where their music is played throughout the film.<br /><br />Fun Fact: In 2004 McFly landed a coveted spot in the Guinness Book of Records for becoming the youngest band with a number one album in Britain. The previous holders of this record were The Beatles!<br /><br />McFly also went on to win Best Pop Act at The Brits (UK Grammys) in 2005.<br /><br />As of 2017 currently the 12th highest selling boyband in British chart history.<br /><br />Career album/singles sales in UK: 1.6 million/1.8 million = 3.4 million<br /><br />9.Transylvania: UK#1 (7th)<br />11.Star Girl: UK#1 (6th),<br />12.Don't Stop Me Now: UK#1 (5th)<br />13.I'll Be Ok: UK#1 (4th)<br />14.All About You: UK#1 (3rd)<br />16.Obviously: UK#1 (2nd)<br />17.Five Colours In Her Hair: UK#1 (1st).
B005LAIHY0|4.0|but the actual story line what somewhat disappointing; after I saw the opening credits I expected a more dramatic story development; alien predators always end up invading human bodies in an attempt to wipe out (or take over) the human race, regardless of their level of technology....  lol
1409134318|5.0|... so it isn't some great wonder that this also happens to our hero Harry Bosch.<br /><br />In the last book ([[ASIN:0446556696 The Drop (A Harry Bosch Novel)]], instead of chosing retirement Harry Bosch returned to the LAPD with a 5 year contract under the Deferred Retirement Option Plan - \\"The DROP\\". He now works with the Open Unsolved Unit trying to bundle up Cold Cases.<br /><br />And there it comes along ... May 1992 - The Snow White case.<br />So called because most of the other victims after May 1992, and after four LAPD officers were acquitted for the savage beating of Rodney King, were of colour. What was a very young and very white Danish reporter doing in the middle of the looting and beating that took place for weeks in certain quarters of Los Angeles.<br />Harry and his colleagues - working under wartime conditions and the supervision of ex-Gulf-War troopers - can only do that much on the crime scene.<br />Not enough to solve this apperently so futile murder. But there WAS someone to gain of the death of the free-lance reporter...<br /><br />And now it has come his way - the Snow White. And Harry, the old bloodhound as always, begins to sniff in all possible places to find his [[ASIN:1409134326 The Black Box]]. He calls it that way because he knows: In every case there is a Black Box, like those who are nearly indestructable and give away - when found - their knowlegde about airplane or ship desasters. He only needs to find his special Black Box to resolve the case.<br />And he will find it. And will try to hunt the culprit(s) down.<br />But he himself is a hunted, too.<br />He has lacked of respect for the (In)competence of his superiors at LAPD - especially his current Lieutenant O'Toole more or less friendly nicked \\"O'Fool\\" -who refers Bosch to Internal Affairs on what seems to be a petty cause. But it could become very important because it can affect the way Harry may run or not the investigation. And he could lose his job very easily if the complaint remains standing.<br />But in the very end also the Internal Affairs will be of very, but very very important use for our hero, who has centered a wasp's nest with his investigation.<br />And - as I said above - we are all gettin' older every day - and so's our Harry.<br />So also heroes need a helping hand, sometimes...<br /><br />This book is a perfect read not only for friends and lovers of Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch, but for all those who like their Police Proceduals with the very personal touch only an author of this bravura nowadays dares to use on his protagonists.<br />And that is an experience to value highly - in this times of easy e-books and wishy-washy investigations!int remains standing.<br />But in the very end also the Internal Affairs will be of very, but very very important use for our hero, who has centered a wasp's nest with his investigation.<br />And - as I said above - we are all gettin' older every day - and so's our Harry.<br />So also heroes need a helping hand, sometimes...<br /><br />This book is a perfect read not only for friends and lovers of Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch, but for all those who like their Police Proceduals with the very personal touch only an author of this bravura nowadays dares to use on his protagonists.<br />And that is an experience to value highly - in this times of easy e-books and wishy-washy investigations!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been completely amazed at the level of talent these musicians display. Every song is unique and inspiring, with no gimicks or fluff. I am a huge fan of this music.
0345803485|1.0|Just had heard so much about this I had to sneak down to a used bookstore and read some.  Could only find a new copy however (what, non an the remainder table?  says something here).  So I found a dark corner--one with 50 shades of dark I guess--in which to read.<br /><br />After about five \\"Holy Crap!\\" Batman's there and six or so more \\"murmurs\\" (a sexy word I'm told) I'd gotten the gist of this book and the now famous sophomoric skill of the writer.  Of course all of us writers are so damn jealous of this author lady with 40 million in trilogy sales.<br /><br />I give the lady with the pen one star for editing and the writing here I give almost three stars; not as bad as I'd been lead to believe, actually.  And the BDSM research?  Well, according to two of my very BDSM friends, rather make believe in many parts.  So maybe three stars on the BDSM research.  But sales?  Of course, 10 stars.  Or more like don't know if you count the trilogy as one or three, the the count is 40M I'm told.<br /><br />Well, what would Ms. J. K. Rowlings think?<br /><br />Yes, the most ever published on Amazon is now this other lady with the first name of two initials.  Gotta be something here for writers about the two initials.  Like those 40M shady books sold so far; about 3.5M copies of each of the trilogy at the 30M mark; hmmm.  At $10 a book say...and at, let say a 5% Random House US&UK contract percent to the author, that's 10,000,000 books X $10 per book X .05 to writer... five million smackers to the lady with the word processor.  Not a bad an author payday for being too broke to hire an editor with a thesaurus; or the entire journey from ebook to hard book that has now changed book publishing forever.<br /><br />But, one star or five, you got to hand it to E.L. James.  She may have gone to writing school on our dime but, again, what the hey.  She has by far set a world record for reviews on Amazon; which seems now the only thing that matters in selling books.  (And, am I even being genuine here?  I have to say I later went out and bought the trilogy for my wife; so what does a One Star mean when you go out and buy the book you hate?)<br /><br />I'd say the planet is a better place now that she's gotten a lot of women randy for some Red Room heavy breathing; so noble prize to this lady for that, I say. But, I just hope the American and UK male can catch up.  For sure only women and jealous male authors are reading this mommy porn beyond the 40 pages I think.  If so, not much hope for a solution here for the guys to up the sexy time action.  Unless the women ask for it.  Which is the story line here, no?  Hey, maybe now they will?<br /><br />Dear reader, you want some road tested blue-marks-on-her-butt feedback from my across town BDSM friend here?  Then you got to as our hero lady's naughty boyfriend, pay attention.  In the real Dark Eros world you don't whip out a S/M contract that soon,  Mr. dumb ass Christian Grey.  And you negotiate more.  And you don't drink white wine, says Rori at BetweenMySheets dot come, maven of the 2012 top 100 sex blogs, along with her middle America St. Louis sexpert friend Kendra Holliday at thebeautifulkind.  No white wine at the control end of the flogger?  Hmmm.  Well, my blue bottom friend says her lover/master does drink white wine implement in hand.  So there go all the rules.<br /><br />More BDSM expert feedback: You don't, Mr. Christian Grey, need to be fixed or healed by love.  You are OK being your ol' badass self.  So why downvalue the tale? Why do a tidy must wrap all up in a neat bow at the end type ending?  Unless that's the way the UK and the US wants their erotic story to end.  And you as a book seller want to please.  And the 10M books want so to get sold.<br /><br />Good book, bad book, blue or red butt book...who cares.  Green authors are talking and dissing and people are reading.  Anytime something makes for more readers of any kind that's good I say; one more wonderful reason to shoot your television 'cause you just don't have the time.  And this is a good thing.<br /><br />At a local book talk last month an editor said the resoundingly successful adult themed then Catcher In The Rye would be filed up high there on the left today in your local bookstore under Young Adult Fiction.  Wonder where 50 will end up a decade from now?<br /><br />Been told 4 kinds of books exist: Good books that don't sell; good books that do; bad books that don't sell; bad books that do.  How about two more: books that get read and books that don't.  Lots of folks are reading this well read book in the waiting room onside of the Big Red Room of Pain.  And if folks are getting wet I say that's a good thing.  Got to love any writer that gets arty type tongues wagging, too, I say.<br /><br />Sure, nobody is talking about the 4,500 one-star Amazon reviews; because this book has changed American and UK lit culture.  And, as to pumping book sales?  A one star equals a five star today.  And a review in New York Review of Books?  Nothing next to five Holy Craps and 50 one star reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Best news of all with this work?  We are once again getting honest about sex; but this time Dark Eros type sex.  And it's always been there, nibbling on us. So, more honesty...gotta like that. Hello 70s reborn.  But this time it's all about the mystery and the Dark and the nexus of pleasure, pain and wonder.  Well, sex is ever a mystery, no?  And we got a lot to learn yet here it looks like. So, we best get busy.  And, speaking of getting busy, I gotta run.  Got one of those hurry up Christmas comin' dates with a vendor at my local feed and cowboy supply outlet and then to off to Home Depot...to buy new love toys of course.  Spending, spending.  This book is sure to be the only thing to pull us out of a major recession.  Nice.r television 'cause you just don't have the time.

B004JMSIRC|5.0|It's the first one and WOW. Does the comic justice and the some. Just buy this,it's funny,action packed with a good story.
B009M8TA20|1.0|If I could give it negative stars I would.  .  Poorly written/translated... in the voice of an adolescent soccer hooligan.  Mr. Ibrahimovic seems incapable of looking at his life with any hint of a critical eye... hmm, like an adolescent.
B00319ECGK|5.0|I was blown away when I first saw this in the theater. This flick pushed the boundary on action film making. This was what Johnny Mnemonic should have been.
1589795474|5.0|Excellent book!! This is problem one of the best books on the market to date. I will recommend this book to anyone that wants to acquire wealth!!!!
B004IFYN2E|4.0|I really like the way it is a throwback to the older films. I thought these two actors worked really well together and the story and action was good. In this day and age people are expecting way to much. I think you will like this film.
0783231202|5.0|I love this movie.  I have been obsessed with it since it came out.  As a black person, I may be biased, but I think it is such a great movie--one of the best that handles the slavery and slave ship issues.  It is a rude awakening for people of all races--and if it isn't it should be because it was for me!  Received it in great condition and in a timely manner!!
B004ULEEY8|4.0|It's a war movie with aliens in it. How can you go wrong,albeit the dialogue isn't academy award winning but it's not supposed to be. It's a shoot em up movie,that's it.
B005ZMTYTQ|4.0|Watched the trailer and that was enough to get me to watch the movie. This is not a deep movie but what I like to call a good popcorn flick.  Alien boy learns what his superpowers are and falls in love with the girl.  This is a basic plot but fun to watch the process.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I really love this Story! It's the best out of all of the others. But I have to say that the pop-ups are pretty annoying. Other than that, its really entertaining and fun to expand and design your resteraunt the way you want it. My dad is playing it now because of me! Tip: Don't spend your first diamonds. You might really need those for better things on higher levels later. Tip 2: Save up your money for expansions, and not goofy things like a &quot;Robo Dog&quot; that doesn't even do anything. (Which is 20,000 coins, by the way)  Tip 3: Have fun designing your resteraunt! I really do recomend this app!
B006ISJQ3K|5.0|As a die hard Diana Ross fan, I was thrilled to see this groundbreaking, classic album re-released, extended....This truely was one of her all time best.....from the &#34;Black and White photos.....her classic beauty ....to the absolutely stunning vocals....<br />Miss Ross's committment to her angelic voice breaking down raw emotions....&#34;Do you know where you're going to&#34;....you cant help but wonder as she asks .....&#34;Come in from the Rain&#34;.......yes you feel her beckoning you in......I especially enjoyed the alternate takes....where you can here her laughter, her sheer joy in her craft.....<br />A star, an icon who has spent her life taking us to places we only dream of....

B004G606K8|5.0|I have read the entire series now and thought it was a great series! I will warn any future reader now that if you take up this series you will not be able to put it down!
B0097L29KM|5.0|forget his recent release &#34;americana&#34;<br />which i considere it more like some outtakes from this album.<br />psychedelic pill is the real neil young & crazy horse you were expecting long ago.<br />definately it´s a real treat. nothing is wrong. loud guitars, big feedback,<br />great songs & neil´s vocals are great, they seem to evade the waste of time.<br />i bought the vinyl version & paid a huge amount for it, no problem.<br />the only thing that bugs me is that on the cd version you get a bonus song<br />& on the vinyl you get a whole side with bonus art etching instead.<br />ok, that the record was pressed in the top notch german record plant pallas &<br />with a new mastering for the vinyl (who does that, today?)<br />but i would of prefered the side f with music, an interview or even a fly on the wall<br />of neil & crazy horse laying it out in the studio.<br />one more complain: the cover. i have a bad time putting the record out, not to mention<br />having to put it back in again.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|will be wasting time w this one  dont let thr kids waste ur coins!! totally addicting .  could not resist coin buying!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love time travel stories, and I have always been a fan of Stephen King. After reading the description of this book, I thought it might be something I would enjoy. I was SO RIGHT!!! Awesome book, loved the characters, liked the historical references. I did not write this review as soon as I read the book - it's been a few months now .... and I am going to go read it again - it's that's good!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Fast read... not quite so sure about his voyage -- guess I'll have to wait until I make the trip myself...
B004GVUPFE|5.0|Makes you think!  It can definitely be challenging if you like to be challenged.  I can't think of any more good things to say.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|I LOVE this album!  Ray Lamontagne is wonderful, I could listen to him for hours.  I put this in my car CD player and it has been there for weeks. I especially love the strings and brass on many of the tracks, very relaxing to listen to. Well worth the purchase!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I really enjoyed the gentler images of a society less violent than we Americans are.  The only parts that I did not like were when people from Earth had to &#34;conquer&#34; and make subservient another civilization that had found better ways of living than violence as on Earth.

B007HGPBRC|5.0|I miss Hitchens.  This book takes us through his finally days.  I am sure it is not the exact final days but the writing shows the path that Hitchens had to take due to his cancer.  I hope i can show the bravery that Hitchens shows us in this book.<br /><br />If there was an afterlife then Hitchens is one of the persons i'd like to meet.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love this season and the whole series. It was a lot cheaper to buy on here was well worth it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been telling everybody I know about The Piano Guys. I have my parents hooked on them, I wear my Piano Guys t-shirt all the time, I just want the world to know how awesome these guys are. A friend showed me the video for Cello Wars and since then I've been hooked. I really can not stop listening to this album. I go scrolling through my iPod trying to figure out what I'm in the mood for, and I end up going right back to this one. No matter how many times I listen to any certain song, each time I feel like I'm hearing it for the first time!<br /><br />I am going to refrain from listing all of my favorites because I would list every track and it would be pointless. Highly recommended for anybody that has a deep love for classical music. I grew up listening to the likes of John Williams, Hans Zimmer,, etc... Jon and Steven should really be doing movie soundtracks, in my personal opinion. Heck, if I was a filmmaker, they're the first people I'd come to. They also take old classics and modernize them and make them sound, well, REALLY badass. I'm grateful to them for their wonderful talent and creativity.
0375703764|5.0|Prepare yourself to be terrified. As you are now, sitting there, wondering whether or not to invest in something that the masses call &#34;complex&#34;, don't be foolish, don't pass this one on. This is Mark Z. Danielewski at his absolute finest. I read this book in five days. I munched on scraps, slept for only minutes at a time, shut my phone off and myself off from all communication, and my only regret is how quickly it all came to an end. If the first page doesn’t hook you, I urge you to give it at least five, I promise that after that, you'll be so intrigued you won't be able to stop. My advice? Pack some snacks and stack some pillows, sit back and get comfortable, you're in for one hell of a ride. My favorite line? Too many. Respect the subplots, the structure, the appendix, the game Danielewski has involved you in without asking for permission. House of Leaves is probably the greatest contemporary novel of the 2000's. To miss it, would be to miss a part of our history.<br /><br />“Why did god create a dual universe? So he might say ‘Be not like me. I am alone.' And it might be heard.”
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We have seen the Piano Guys twice in live performance and have all their CDs. They are attracting<br />younger people to classical music. They are great musicians and entertainers.
0375869026|1.0|This book tells the story of one year in the life of a facially challenged (some might say \\"disfigured\\") 10-year-old boy who apparently has some type of variant of  Treacher-Collins Syndrome.  It is worth reading because it inadvertently gives a lot of examples of what NOT to do if one is facially or any-other-way challenged!  The author admits she has had no personal experience in living life with a unique appearance.  Unfortunately, that is quite obvious in the way she wrote the book.<br /><br />In the book, August's mother, who is his homeschooling teacher, decides that it is a good idea for Auggie to attend groupschooling, rather than continue the homeschooling he has so far done.  Huge mistake!  Group schooling is a fake, superficial environment that is not found anywhere else.  Never again in life, with the exception of boot camp perhaps, another equally artificial situation, will large numbers of human beings of exactly the same age be placed in direct, relentless competition with one another.  Even in college, there are older students and atypical students.  And the very LAST thing a facially-challenged child or any unusual child needs is direct, relentless competition.  In fact, groupschooling is detrimental to even so-called \\"normal\\" kids.  Only a few become \\"winners\\" in this hypercompetitive situation.  Most become \\"losers\\" and inevitably give up early, with permanent, lifelong, detrimental consequences.  I've met many 50 to 60-year-olds with profound regrets over their wasted school years half a century ago.  By age 14, most kids have mentally/emotionally \\"abandoned\\" school, even if they are still present physically.  This is why half the population is now functionally illiterate, reading at best at a 6th grade level.  Half the US population couldn't read this critique even if they wanted to.....That is so sad....  Sometimes I wonder why parents throw their young, enthousiastic, energetic children into such a pressure-cooker during the most tender, vulnerable period in these young human beings' entire  lives?  The exact time in life we are least able to handle hypercompetitiveness is the time we are drowning in it.  The only answer I can come up with is that we humans tend to recreate our childhoods endlessly, passing on our dysfunction to the next generation, creating another cohort of people using addictions to medicate their childhood pain.  Our parents create another generation of drinkers, druggers, overeaters, sex addicts, TV/computer addicts, gamblers, workaholics, hypochondriacs, etc., etc., etc.  I wonder what Auggie would be like at age 50, under the burden of years of stress and pressure and trauma.  We forget, but life is truly a marathon, after all.....<br /><br />In addition to the negative hypercompetitiveness, the \\"socialization\\" in groupschooling situations is nearly 100% negative.  Personally, I don't know what benefit parents see in all the negative socialization.  Perhaps they have forgotten the pain of their own school years.  Even the few popular  \\"winners\\" in groupschool situations agonize over one zit or one misstep, wondering if they will be toppled from their high social perch among the \\"in\\" group as a result.  Cliques, in/out groups, bullying, ostracizing, gossiping, fighting, sex, drugs, alcohol, you name it, it's all there and it's all negative.  Yet many well-meaning but deluded parents, such as Auggie's, continue to subject their kids to this torture.  The author, RJ Palacio, does a reasonably good job of describing the negatives here, but misses the very obvious solution:  a return to homeschooling!  That would be a good idea for his sister, Olivia, too.  Even Auggie mentions he had more free time as a homeschooler.  Duh.....Group situations are always timewasters.... He who learns alone learns the fastest.  Groupschooling holds most back because everyone waits for the last or the slowest.  With individual schooling, everyone proceeds very efficiently at their own pace.  Trauma and stress are cumulative, and even more dangerous when they start in early childhood.  Children are NOT resilient.  We each only have a certain quota of trauma we can handle before we fall apart into dysfunctional behaviors such as acting out, addictions, or mental illness to self-medicate our emotional pain.  Just ask any 50-year-old smoker, drinker, or overeater when they started their acting out and why.  The answer usually goes back to childhood trauma.  The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study proved that conclusively.  Auggie is facing a lifetime of increased stress and trauma due to his facial anomaly.  Why pile more on than is necessary at age 10?  By age 50, he may be maxxed out and may fall apart.<br /><br />Groupschooling situations are dangerous.  Kids do get murdered in groupschools, especially the larger ones.  Auggie could very easily have been badly injured or even accidentally killed that night at the campout.  Sort of like a Piggy situation in \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"  Even nice schoolkids can temporarily become the equivalent of Nazi prison guards with strong enough peer pressure.  What were the adults in this book possibly thinking of, when they placed Auggie in such a precarious position?  As a child, I always thought adults were often out to lunch, and they sure were in this book!  Only Auggie's dad had a small amount of common sense, when he felt that groupschooling for Auggie was like \\"leading a lamb to slaughter....\\"  Too bad he didn't stick to his initial gut reaction, which was correct.  I think our future alternative to groupschools will be the return of the one-room schoolhouse.  Groupschools are too large, too complex, and too expensive for bankrupt countries such as ours to maintain much longer, anyhow.  And there will be no money for transportation to such overly distant schools.  The one-room schoolhouse was the foundation of this country.  They were economical to maintain and transportation was not a problem.  The kids got exercise walking  to and from school, so they were happy to sit still and learn once they got there.  The focus remained on academics and wasn't diluted by sports or cliques or whatever.  One-room schoolhouses foster minimal competition because all ages and abilities are mixed together.  The socialization will be more positive, for the most part, because students learn to cooperate together, with the older students helping the younger ones and the faster ones helping the slower ones.  It's much harder to have a clique in a one-room schoolhouse if there isn't anyone to have a clique with!<br /><br />How am I able to critique this book so forcefully?  Because I was personally in the equivalent of Auggie's situation.  At age ten, Auggie's age, I was just starting not my 1st, but my 4th new school.  Imagine being a new girl four times by 5th grade and how hard that is.....  Like Auggie, I was \\"physically challenged\\" and looked different from everyone else in my class.  But I was also of a minority ethnic background and minority religion.  I came from \\"the wrong side of the tracks,\\" and was, fortunately and unfortunately, the most intelligent student in my class.  Believe me, all of that together was a prescription for total social failure.  I never had a \\"Summer\\" or a \\"Jack Will\\" in my life.  In real life, I don't think they exist--or if they do, very, very rarely, and not something one can count on.  I ended up eating lunch with the \\"special ed\\" kids as we called them back then.  The \\"special ed\\" kids were developmentally disabled, and didn't move away like other kids did when I sat down at a lunch table.  Summer and Jack give a fake sense of warmheartedness to the book, but in real life, when push comes to shove, peer pressure will be too much for them and they'll side with the Nazi camp guards like Julian.  It takes a huge amount of courage and the ability to resist extreme peer pressure for kids like Summer and Jack to associate with a class outcast.  They run the risk of jeopardizing their own precarious social position in the class pecking order by befriending a \\"freak\\" like Auggie.  Most kids, if not nearly all, don't have the courage.  Even my own cousins pretended they didn't know me in school.  And I can't blame any of them, by the way.  I don't know what I would do in their exact situation, but I do know that in 3rd grade when I and one other girl, who was quite obese, and one other boy, who was mildly developmentally disabled, were the only ones in our classroom who didn't have any valentines in our valentine bags, I didn't send any to them and they didn't send any to me.  None of us outcasts could afford to befriend each other.  If we did, it would clearly cement our class status at the bottom of the barrel for all to see.  This way we could each pretend our bottom-feeder position in the class pecking order was a little nebulous.  The one thing I do regret to this day, almost 50 years later, was that I didn't think to send those two and myself a couple of anonymous valentines \\"from your secret pal,\\" so that the three of us would not have had to pretend to open up valentines during the class party, when everyone else opened up their real ones.  During that veeeery loooong party, I simply pretended I had valentines in my bag by reaching in to \\"check.\\" I pretended I was opening them slowly about 10 times or more.  And why couldn't our teacher have checked whose valentine bag was empty, like I did, and stick a few cards in each empty bag herself?  Why couldn't my mother have told me to stick an anonymous valentine in those other 2 bags and my own?  Did they both forget their own schooldays when the number of valentines received was a concrete measure of one's popularity?  I was a zero, nada, zip.  Along with the other two misfits.  It would have been a kindness to stick in an anonymous card or two, a kindness I figured out too late to help those other 2 kids and myself.  But in third grade, I was only 8 years old.  I had an excuse.  The adults didn't.  As I say, adults are clueless.<br /><br />By the way, no parent with any common sense would give a boy who looks like Auggie a name like \\"August.\\"  Appearance-challenged kids draw too much negative attention to themselves as it is, and we don't need additional extraneous attention from an unusual name, or from anything else that is nonessential, that is for sure.  For the most part, we want to \\"pass\\" invisible.  Tom or Andy would make much better names, even though I personally think that \\"Auggie\\" is quite cute!  What might work better is a name like \\"Thomas August Pullman.\\"  And when Auggie is comfortable in his own skin, then he himself decides to go from \\"Tom\\" to \\"Auggie\\" if HE wishes.  But the choice should be HIS!  And I never had another kid go to bat for me like Jack did punching Julian out after Julian called Auggie a freak.  In fact, \\"freak\\" was my nickname in high school.  Everyone called me that behind my back, although thankfully not too often to my face.  I learned to suck all that up, but I deal with some of that childhood pain, even today, of course, even with counseling and recovery....  If one is in a groupschooling situation with no other options, as I was since homeschooling didn't exist back then for me, then the only way out is through.  So, I knew I had to suck all that up.... A 12-year long gauntlet of groupschooling to run....  Rather than Amos and Miles and Henry coming to Auggie's rescue, in my school experience, the opposite would have occurred.  With very rare exception, everyone would have joined the Nazi camp guard ringleader.  Again, the book isn't that realistic, in my experience.  And my family of origin had their own share of dysfunction, so my parents were not in any way as supportive of me as Auggie's were to him in the book.  Most parents aren't that supportive, as evidenced by the large number of Chinese babies with birth defects abandoned in Chinese orphanages.  If we're defective and our parents can get away with dumping us, they sometimes will.  This is not a condemnation, just a fact.  And my older brother, much more so than Via, was jealous of the extra attention I got and my, unfortunately, failed surgeries. Like Via, my parents did not give my older brother enough attention; and as a result, he and I still have a conflicted, tempestuous relationship, now going on for 56 years.  My older brother would never come to my rescue in school or anywhere else.  In fact, he was one of my persecutors.  My father was moderately abusive, especially emotionally, to my older brother, so my older brother passed that trauma on to me by persecuting me, understandably.  What we don't give back, we pass on.  Notice to parents: do not neglect your healthy children, or you will create lifelong enmity between siblings.  Do not show any kind of favoritism to your children, or you will guarantee discord between siblings long after you are gone, discord that is usually lifelong. Get counseling and get into recovery so you don't pass our dysfunction down to your children.<br /><br />Nowadays, it is well known that children with differences should have a \\"show `n tell\\" by way of introduction to a new setting, but the author Palacio apparently isn't aware of that.  Poor Auggie should NEVER have been thrown into a new school with 500 kids and no introduction.  His sister Via should also have a brief  \\"show `n tell\\" about her brother whenever it is appropriate, such as when she didn't want Auggie to be seen by any of her classmates at her new school.  One way to do that, if the clueless parents insist on groupschooling, would be to show a couple photos of Auggie in each homeroom, and maybe add one with his dog, to personalize him. There should be a brief explanation of what he has medically, ie, something similar to Treacher-Collins Syndrome, mention the 27 surgeries and  painful convalescences, and emphasize that this doesn't hurt, at least for the most part, and most especially, isn't contagious.  Everybody, including all the teachers, should get a good, LONG, closeup look at Auggie's face ahead of time, so there will be minimal shock and panic when they finally see him in person on the SECOND day of school.  No way should the irresponsible adults in this situation have allowed a ten-year-old child to be so traumatized as Auggie was, facing 500 new peers all ALONE by himself  in the book.  My mother would sometimes do that same crap to me, forcing me to do things that she herself would be too embarrassed to do.  \<br /><br />It is human nature to stare at the unusual because it is part of our instinct for self-preservation.  If a saber-toothed tiger jumped through our door right now, we better take a quick, piercing stare at it and then run away in a panic or get ready to do battle if we don't want to get eaten alive.  With people like Auggie and myself, once the initial shock is over, and people find out that what we have isn't contagious, then they settle down quicker, and we don't have to take so many panicky stares, look-aways, header-benders, dropped open mouths, etc.  AboutFace [...]  recommends the Explain-Reassure-Distract technique to be used when meeting new people.  Auggie should be taught to Explain he has a birth defect similar to Treacher-Collins syndrome, to Reassure others that it isn't contagious, and to Distract them by changing the subject to the class project, the latest movie, whatever, if/when he is tired of talking about his face.  The Treacher-Collins support group,  [...] will have lots of good, coping ideas, too.  I also recommend carrying \\"business\\" cards, which explain one's unique situation in a few simple terms, when one is not in the mood to provide endless explanations to other  people about one's situation.  There are almost 7 billion humans on earth, and one simply can't spend one's entire life educating them all on one particular situation, so quickly handing out an explanatory card is often helpful.  And unlike Auggie, I didn't get any awards in school.  In fact, just the opposite happened.  I remember two classmates telling me in 8th grade that they thought the principal gave me much harder words than anyone else in the spelling bee on purpose.  Of course, I flubbed up and was out, which is what the Principal wanted.  He probably didn't want the nerdy \\"freak\\" representing HIS school!  At least, that was my conjecture, not being inside his head.<br /><br />In my opinion, Via should never have been allowed to have a boyfriend so early, at age 15.  As a minimum, she should have been told to be much more discreet, avoiding long kisses in public, etc.  No one should be having long kisses in public anyway....  Those PDA's are just a form of bragging and one-upping others, mostly her brother and girlfriends....  And why were her parents letting her boyfriend spend time with her in her BEDROOM?  Do they want her to have a baby or get an STD by age 16???  I hope she has had her HPV vaccine!  Via's mom is worried about her taking the subway alone at age 15, but not about her spending time alone in her bedroom with her boyfriend!  Crazy, I know.... Obviously, parents have no common sense nowadays.  Their JOB is to set reasonable limits.  Such as no dating before age 17.  And NEVER a boy in her bedroom...  So these parents flubbed up badly.  Relations between the sexes are always conflicted and stressful, even at best, so why not stay relationally sober until age 17-18 or even longer?  I didn't start dating until I was 19, and now, I am glad I waited.  So many people my age in their 50-60's have 3-4 ex-husbands or ex-wives, and I only have one ex-husband plus a couple ex-boyfriends.  So delaying participation in the relationship wars turned out to be a blessing in disguise.  Why start the high of a new boyfriend coupled with the near-inevitable low of breaking up later on at such a young age?  Why climb on that gerbil wheel so early?  And imagine how poor Auggie might feel, she so beautiful with such a handsome \\"cool\\" boyfriend while Auggie is, in real life, being ostracized, bullied, and with just about nil chances for a girlfriend at that stage of life.  Later on, yes, but then, no.  The longer that kind of sibling rivalry is delayed, the better.  My brothers were nerdy for different reasons from mine, so they didn't have girlfriends and the issue never arose for me.  And I didn't have a sister, for which I am very, very thankful.<br /><br />Another thing that bugs me about this book, Auggie has almost no external ears, but he does have 2 eyes, so why does the cover portray a boy with one eye, oversized, unequal ears, and a blank face?  Didn't the cover illustrator Tad Carpenter even bother to read the book before doing the illustration?  Maybe blank faces are \\"easier\\" for \\"normal\\" humans to deal with than real but misshapen (to others) ones like Auggie's?  That is totally weird!  \\"Normal\\" people are clueless!  Because kids with Treacher-Collins are really quite cute, especially those teeny, little T-C ears?  They are much cuter than regular ears!  And that irresistible face is really quite adorable!  As Confucious, a Chinese guy known by his Latin name, said, \\"Everything has its beauty, but not everyone sees it.\\"  Yet at one point in the book Auggie mentions that what he has is \\"worse than you can imagine,\\" or something similar to that.  Well, of course, that is total bullcrap!  That's only what the author actually felt.  Auggie's appearance is \\"normal,\\" for him.  And why does Auggie's condition remain nameless in the book?  Is his condition actually so terrible it cannot be drawn on the cover or named inside the pages?  Maybe only if we are still living in the Dark Ages!  What is the purpose of hiding?  Why the shame?  There's nothing shameful here except the author's revelation of her true feelings:  SHE's the one who feels that what Auggie has is too awful to name or show....SHE's the one who feels his face has to be hidden, to be blanked out...  We're only as sick as our secrets, after all....  If Auggie had a Treacher-Collins variant, then why not show a cute drawing of someone similar to that?  Not this blank face!  Do you ever see T-C people walking around?  Granted, it's a rare syndrome, but most spend a lot of time hiding at home because they get worn out dealing with human nutcases every time they take a step outside the house.  This book could have helped release those people from their self-imposed prison.  Others seeing them would think, \\"Oh, that person looks like Auggie!\\"  What an incredible educational opportunity that was totally missed!  Sad, really.  And there really are children born with one eye, but they are either stillborn or die shortly after birth, as that severe level of facial/brain maldevelopment isn't compatible with life, so why illustrate it on the cover?<br /><br />We human beings are fallible--all of us, including myself.  No one can be depended on, 100%.  We all let each other down, at one time or another, including us letting ourselves down.  And for each of us, physically different or not, there is an existential aloneness. Each one of us, whether we admit it or not, is truly alone.  When I realized that, I could soften my desperate desire for friends/relationships at any and all costs, overcome my co-dependence, and minimize my people-pleasing.  We must realize that we cannot depend on fallible human beings to be there when we need them.  Because quite often, they aren't.  No need to get depressed or suicidal over something that simply is.  Acceptance of what is and cannot be changed is the solution to my problems.  We cannot depend on friends in foul weather.  They may be there.  They may not.  And I am here to say that having lots of friends while growing up is not essential.  I managed to survive my groupschooling torture without a single friend.  Let me repeat that for the many who have no friends in school right now:  You don't need friends to survive school!  I survived without a single friend!  Oh, a person here and there who would tolerate me for a while, thank goodness, but not one single, dependable friend from 5th grade on thru 12th that I could truly trust.  Granted, I was a \\"new girl\\" again in 8th grade, 5 school changes in 12 years due to my family's dysfunction, so by 8th grade the \\"cliques\\" were set thru high school and I wasn't a part of any of them.  I ended up being an outcast until I finished school.  How, then, does a person survive?  Surrounded by all these fallible human beings, who are sometimes there for me when the going is easy, but drop me when the going gets tough, how do I survive?  Who is there to sustain me?  Who can I depend on all the time, not just when things are easy?  Myself.  Coupled with a Power greater than myself, a Higher Power, an Intelligent Creator, a Divine Force, a Great Spirit, whatever term works for you.  With a Power greater than myself and a few of my fellows now and again sent as \\"guardian angels,\\" I can survive and even prosper.<br /><br />All in all, this is a rather poorly written book, conveying shame about a straight-forward physical condition, unrealistically optimistic, and with way too much dependence placed on other people being there to meet our needs, which usually doesn't happen.  Ok, I'll give the author an \\"A\\" for effort, and the topic an \\"A,\\" as birth defects and chronic illnesses aren't often the subject of books.  But it is really unfortunate that the author simply didn't have and didn't obtain the first-hand knowledge of the subject needed to write a truly helpful book for those with facial anomalies and other congenital defects.  Maybe it is almost inevitable that those of us with first-hand knowledge don't publish books?  Maybe  writing a book is something too emotionally searing for us to do?  Can you imagine a person with a facial difference dealing with all the stares while attending book signings and all the other things an author has to do to promote abook?  Eeewww!  It would probably be too much for us....I think....  Maybe I could do it when I was quite old..... retired, even.....  Maybe not...ould get a good, LONG, closeup look at Auggie's face ahead of time, so there will be minimal shock and panic when they finally see him in person on the SECOND day of school.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|We owned the trilogy on dvd, but it's worth the upgrade to get the blu ray version. We have a blu ray player that upgrades the quality of dvd's and it was still worth it for us to own the blu ray. The biggest difference that I noticed was with the sound. The surround sound is awesome and it really is the best way to watch these classics!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love this phone case. It protects my phone from everyday damage. It was it great shape and looks and works great
B000PMG16U|5.0|We had the DVD versions of these movies. But it was very worth the money to upgrade to a Blu Ray. The biggest difference that I noticed was with the sound. The surround sound on the Blu Ray is a big deal. It makes you feel like you're in the action and it's someting new you haven't experienced with Star Wars since you saw it in the theatres!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I expected it to be better than that...and the sudo star trek like music was annoying.  I would not tell someone to see it
146500632X|5.0|FAST SHIPPING & cute!
B005L38QHA|2.0|the software for this device is one WoW patch behind, the latest patch is 5.1 for Pandaria and the  drivers/profiles for this mouse are not 100% compatible. You get random movement anomalies and the auto pivot features of the game camera is also not compatible with the built in profile.
1577314808|5.0|I personally know a lot of people that criticize self-help books, or spiritual guides, But I'm not one to do that so I gave this book a chance. As I began to read the book I really began to connect with what the author was trying to say. If the book has taught me anything, it's to move away from my constant analytical thinking and more into a state of observance and acceptance of life.  This book wasn't boring, or filled with confusing metaphors. Instead I found myself being very relaxed and open to his words. Allowing him to come into my mind because he creates space around what he is saying, I am not trained in meditation, but I realized that his words slowed me down from my normal agitated grasping thoughts to being in the now. He is so compelling that I was in the \\"now\\" while reading his book. This only proved there was an instant connection between the reader and author. Since reading this book, I have accepted it to be my new life manual for every day living as a constant reminder that each moment is a new experience and that's all we need to focus on. I've gotten nothing but great results. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in self-enlightenment. Sooner or later make no mistake that Eckhart's techniques lead to true success.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|I read Paper Towns, after reading Looking for Alaska and TFIOS, I was really surprised with this book John Green is a flawless  narrator I am very proud of reading this, it was really interesting and well built.<br />If you are doubting about reading this my best recommendation: Do it. Right now.You won't regret it.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|So bad it's good. Just watch it. No surprise, no great acting, lots of the good parts shown in the trailer. Who cares! Enjoy life.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|OF COURSE I RECOMMEND THIS SERIE'S.I HATE HAVING TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT SERIE'S BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT IT'S AN AWESOME SHOW
B009SQRL4U|4.0|My 7 year old daughter loved it! I rented this for a short car trip. She thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
0385504225|5.0|The product delivery was good. The product was what was advertised. The price for the product was good. No problems or issues.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|it really makes me mad when some ripoff loser company sees how successful minecraft and try to remake there own and steal minecrafts costomers
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|The storyline is just pathetic!  All the movie is is visual stunts.  Stunts that if tried in the real world could not be accomplished.  Americans can't think anymore so this movie will appeal to the masses.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I ordered the Blue-ray/DVD of 'Moonrise Kingdom' and got an e-mail stating that I get the Amazon Video On Demand version for free. I thought this was a pleasant surprise until I went to view my video library and it was listed as a 24-hour rental that expires in one month. There is nothing in the e-mail that I received indicating that this video is a rental or that it expires. Granted, I did not order it and was not expecting it, but the e-mail was misleading enough that I'm giving the video 1 star even though the movie itself was excellent.
0547848412|5.0|Like a beautiful painting, \\"Life of Pi\\" is a delightful, rich and rewarding tale.  I read the book from cover to cover in no time.  It was quite good.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I prefer the Weather Bug app since it seems to work a little better IMHO (is free too!) and is &#34;approved by Amazon.&#34;
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Sequels are rarely as good as the original.  This isn't as good as the original book; however, it is worth reading.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Boy does Tom Cruise ever know how to deliver on a action character! I just can't wait to see One Shot.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a fun way to kill time when I'm bored. I wish you didn't have to unlock games but I guess it gives the game an objective
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I work at a book store but still was skeptical about the fan fare this series garnered but I'm an Amazon Prime member so I used a &#34;free book&#34; and read it. Then I HAD to read the other two since I was addicted to the life of Katniss and her associated characters.
B00062PN6I|4.0|These headphones are perfect because of the fact that there is the mini plug that's for MP3 players and computers and a wider plug for my keyboard.  The only thing is that the soft parts that go around your ears can sometimes fall off but it is pretty easy to fix it once you have done it once  All in all just what i wanted.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I'm a real action movie fan and this is everything I could have ever asked for in an action movie plus, plus, plus! Be prepared for the age of the stars kind of like nearly expired cereal it is still good but it is nice when the prize appears at the bottom of the box and you can say I Won!
B0098VXE50|5.0|Kristen Stewart is as useless as ever, other than that it's an awesome movie, definitely recommend it to every one
B004FOA84A|5.0|I tried for a couple months to work out all the clues but after failing to solve this electronic puzzle I...
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is probably the best battery app I have found to date. I have no complaints what so ever.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I love all of the old songs from House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence. There are three new songs that are great. The price is really low for three disks. It's great to have all the Weeknd's music together in one package. I have loaded all three disks onto my computer at work and home. I have the CDs in my car. And, I have all of the songs on my ipod. Lol.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a great deal and of course a great product. I love these movies and I'm glad that they came out with a set.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|When I was little, my brothers and I would watch this movie every Christmas Day.  It became a favorite family tradition that continued on until I was about 14 or so.  Two years ago, my husband and I were reminiscing about lost/forgotten Christmas traditions, and I couldn't believe it when he told me he'd never seen The Snowman.  Of course, I had to order a copy for us to watch immediately.  He loved it, as did I.  It's become a much anticipated Christmas Eve tradition for us ever since.  I can't wait to watch The Snowman again this year.  It's just such a beautiful movie.  Great for kids and grown-ups alike!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I've been a big fan of Steely Dan & Donald Fagen's solo efforts for a long time.  This newest CD is very well done, with an excellent backing band, and new material very well written.  Fans will not be disappointed.
B000UBRT94|5.0|I had this album way back on cassette. So I bought it again. I hate this review process because it requires so many words.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|I don't get with all the bad reveiws, this game is sooo freakin awesome!!!!! GET IT RIGHT KNOW!!!! Sometimes its a little frustrating but soo fun!!!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I have all the BBT episodes on Amazon. I watch them all the time! And on Amazon, I can watch them from anywhere without having to carry any DVDs
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I learned a lot about laws, justice, prisons, gold, the DEA, etc.  I was really swept along by Grisham's story until the end when I felt annoyed and cheated because of the way he set up the plot by leading me along by omissions along the way.  That  doesn't mean others will feel this way.  Besides, they will learn a lot about laws, justice, prisons, gold, the DEA, etc.
B0086449YA|5.0|I have been a fan of Knopfler since I first heard Sultans of Swing on the radio for the first time in 1978 and ever since that day I have been enraptured by his playing and storytelling.  I own his entire body of work.  This is a gorgeous album, at least as good as the Dire Straits album Love over Gold or as his solo Sailing to Philadelphia (both of which are two of my favorite musical works).  From the opening bars of Redbud Tree to Song of the Drowned Submariner, this album is a rich feast for the ears.  Kingdom of Gold, Go Love, Song of the Drowned Submariner and Yon Two Crows are haunting short stories set to music.  Privateering, my favorite track on the album, is such a fun song and one can almost feel the ocean spray on one's face. Knopfler once again makes musical magic.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Makes you feel like your right there very interesting book, amazing what these men and women go through to protect our freedom.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I really liked reading it. Can't put down the Reacher series! I am not sure how I will like the movie. Tom Cruise is not 6'5\\", 250 pounds, and blonde headed!
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Great movie, wonderfully done, and an excellent ending to the trilogy.  I definitely am going to buy this now that I have seen it.
1439153663|5.0|Great story.  Loved the character development and the historic accuracy at the plantation and in Colonial Williamsburg.<br />Great idea combining irish indentured servant and black slavery.
1607066017|5.0|I love BKV's stuff but this book goes above and beyond.  If you like sci-fi or action, and great writing, you'll love this.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Liked the book, but it was much slower read than the first two.  I didn't love the ending, either. Overall, it summed up the series. Must read if you read the first two!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|*****,  A must read True story of a Michigan Family torn apart after a Loving Mother Kills Herself.  This story is the beginning of my journey through life .   Things aren't always what they seam.  But faith and Love are KEY.  Phase 1
6305882592|1.0|My partner and I have a massive age difference (40 years instead of 60), so I thought I'd watch this to see hollywood's take on a relationship like this. The plot was cute, I guess, but it was very short and the ending was terrible. It was nice that it showed that two people are capable of loving each other despite age, but it seemed to imply it was only for the insane. This movie was an insult, depressing, and a waste of time. Thank God it was free.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|I love this book, it tells the history of events from a different perspective, not just what the media wants to feed us. It really makes you think on what we do and what we support
1610390938|5.0|[[ASIN:1610390938 Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty]]Poor Economics presents us a clear picture of prevalence of poverty, its causes and consequences, and analysis of efforts undertaken to alleviate poverty, and to increase access to healthcare and education in countries where great portions of respective populations live below poverty line. It tells readers while efforts and intervention are necessary to help those populations, not all efforts and interventions have been successful. It has largely been due to complexities, lack of enough information about the targeted society, poor planning, and people's ignorance, ideologies and inertia. It suggest policies and efforts have to be well-thought and based on realities on the ground.<br /><br />What is very interesting in this book is the presentation of the two opposing ideologies about aid and intervention. The first is S-Shaped economic theory. It believes in existence of poverty trap which perpetuates poverty unless the poor are helped to an extent needed to get out of the trap. The book mostly supports this idea and proves aid and intervention are necessary to alleviate poverty through microfinance, increasing access to healthcare and education. However, the policies and efforts to achieve these goals have to be well-thought out and implemented based on realities on the ground to bear great results for future.<br /><br />On the other hand, it implicitly rejects the idea of L-shaped theory based on which aid and intervention are not useful since they corrupt officials of those countries, and make the poor reliant on foreign aid there. Based on this ideology societies can come up with solutions to their problems and alleviate poverty without any outside help since poverty trap does not exist. I believe it is a great source of information, and I highly recommend this book to be studied.
B009SQRL4U|1.0|Glad I did not buy this movie, only rented.  My kids 7, 5 and 2 did not like it at all.  Many better options out there.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was really excited to see how it would all end, who would get their up and comings...but nada. Very unsatisfying ending. The rest of the book is good though so that is why I give it 3 stars.
B00447G29S|5.0|great product both 3d and 2d were amazing.  Intially had some confusion with only one disc being both 3d and 2d but now its resolved.
B0086221SS|1.0|This movie is bad. I could not get through this. The writing/story is bad which is a shame because the actors are the reason why I wanted to see the movie. I had to turn it off. Was this a straight to video movie?
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This show was one of the finest that HBO produced.  The portrayal of life in Rome at the time of Julius Ceasar is probably the most accurate of any show or movie.  The acting is first class and the story is fascinating.  The hours will fly by as you follow the intrigue and betrayal of ancient Rome.  If I have any criticism of the show it is simply that it was only on for 2 seasons.  The characters draw you in and you'll hate when it ends.
B007MLDC2I|5.0|This film has a great soundtrack that keeps you at the edge of your seat. I highly recommend it if you like mysteries.
B001CL4N68|5.0|if you're a hip hop fan this is a must have! if you don't have this album then you're not a real hip hop fan!
B002PA3FTG|3.0|This movie is creepy in a dark comedy sort of way. There is blood and gore and but strangely comedic
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love, love this CD. I've been following Jon and Steve, the piano and cello elements of The Piano Guys, for several years, and they just keep getting better. You don't have to enjoy classical music to enjoy this CD, but this CD may just change your mind. I bought one for me and one for each member of my family for Christmas presents. I just can't help sharing something this fantastic.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Keeps you interested, but not his best.  Not much of a back story and no personal stuff on Bosch.  An easy read nonetheless
B009G78EE2|5.0|I love listening to this, whether I am doing homework, driving somewhere, or working out! I also got another song by Macklemore called And We Danced which is amazing
B003QNXPUK|5.0|Yes they are expensive as far as screen protectors go but well worth the money. You cant destroy them, and they last forever.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|My little boy absolutely loves this movie and its cute for adults as well, it was a nice break from generic cartoons!
0545265355|5.0|Awesome books. Love how they came in a set so that you can have all of them together and handy. They were great reads and I recommend them to people of all ages! Nice to read the book fist before watching the movie!!! Cant wait for the next movies to come out!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter has all of the Tinkerbell movies so I had to add this one to her collection.  It was a great movie for all my kids.
B007N8RULO|1.0|It was hard to navigate and I didn't like the display. I was really disappointed in this app. Don't bother.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Started ok, then became too convoluted and unwieldy. not believable. The best thing was how screwed up the justice us in the usa
1908117230|3.0|this is a nice book, nice picture.<br />covered alot nice recipe.<br />however, it 's for professional !  if you are a home baker. this is not for noob.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This album is terrific.  Rod's sultry voice fits the songs perfectly.  He hasn't lost anything by getting older.  With the exception of a couple of songs, the duets are good.  I highly recommend this for anyone who still likes the &#34;old&#34; Christmas carols.
031620157X|5.0|The book, The Land of Stories:  The Wishing Spell was a wonderful purchase and I would definitely order other books by Chris Colfer.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Enjoyed thoroughly with the family!  We are looking to purchase the Batman trilogy.  The picture quality was excellent as well.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have bought several piano guys songs in the past, and I can't believe it, but they just keep getting better and better. A lot of what is on this album is all new stuff, and is great music to relax to, work to, or have fun with. These guys do an amazing job with their music, this is a great christmas gift or treat for yourself!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|enjoyed every word his books always keep you in suspense and always work out in the end so glad you had this for my kindle
B003DKJ5ZU|4.0|Well done movie that my girls love and I do not mind watching! The animation just keeps getting better and it is fun to see the characters develop as the series continues.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great gift for a granddaughter! she will love it you always have what I need thanks so much for that
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Some of the best songs I've ever heard. Most of the \\"originals\\" are terrible but the piano guys rendition of it is simply amazing!!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|each cd i ordered i'm never disappointed. its great for gifts because. when i buy a cd i play it at work and thats how others find out how great it is and either they order themselves or i will order for them. and going through amozon.com makes it easier for us to enjoy these cd. thank you
B00102FELM|3.0|GREAT DVD, BUT COULD HAVE USED BETTER EDITING. SOUND COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR SUCH A GOOD CONCERT. GOOD LIST OF SONGS.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|the music is wonderful. it brings peace to me and to listen to the sing brings tears of joy. thank you
B007PBKG5G|5.0|I love this entire album! Soulful and unique, this band has talent. Brittany's Howard's voice is something else and I can listen to this album on repeat all day.
B001R60ESE|5.0|One of the best music videos I have ever seen. Great music, superbly recorded, it just doesn't get much better. It also has little of the horrible short attention span quick camera cuts and angles that are so common in todays music videos. A must have for anyone who likes jazz and easy listening music.
B000MCIBB6|5.0|What can you say about the Doors? One of the best bands ever and Waiting just enforces their standing in the rock world!
B005Z271Y6|3.0|I had high hopes for this video. I like Adele and her music so I figured I'd love the video. But I don't. It is nearly unwatchable because they change the camera angle literally every second, sometimes twice per second! Also the quantity of foul language from Adele is completely unnecessary and gratuitous. It gets three stars only because she sounds great while singing. In fact, I enjoy this video more with my eyes closed. Why did I even buy a VIDEO??
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love it! just need some harder levels as I'm flying through the exisisting ones. :) I know a five year old who loves it too!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book is set in the near future when mankind is on its 3rd trip to the Red Planet.  The main character gets trapped on Mars with little chance of survival.  Needless to say, he endures many hardships and the ending is in doubt all the way.  The book is well written and really echoes the Apollo 13 crisis from 1970.  You really begin to root for him as the book invests you in his survival.  If there is one knock on the book, some of the ancillary characters are not well developed and a little unbelievable - though the author obviously made a conscious decision to make it 500 pages of fast paced action rather than bore you with character development.  You cannot go wrong reading the book - It is a really quick read.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|it was great, i'm gonna buy many more!!! it was an excellent service and it arrive on time, earlier than i expected
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World  gives a fascinating insight into WW II events which at the time were under reported or censored.  The story line will be easier to follow if one has read Fall of  Giants.  I would reccommend it especially<br />for readers like myself who can remember some of the events and will appreciate clarification of other events which were not reported in detail at the time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|good quality and easy to play.  This is one of my favorite games! So happy to now have it on my Kindle Fire.  Yeah!!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|It's fun to play but I much prefer the regular Angry Birds. But it's a good change once in a while.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My first introduction to the Piano Guys was a YouTube video where they're playing at an old folks home. It was so much fun! I became an instant fan. Their music is just plain happy and always lifts my spirits. You can tell they totally enjoy what they do!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have fun with this when I get bored and so does my husband. Some times can't decide who gets to play.
B00006JSS8|2.0|I bought this on sale for next to nothing, and it still wasn't worth it. I should have spent a little more to buy these tracks from other Stevie Wonder compilations. These are some of his best songs, and I love listening to them. But a quick listen with my headphones on, and comparing them to samples on Amazon from these same songs in other collections, really brought it home: the sound quality on this particular album is terrible. Tinny, weak, lacking depth. Do yourself a favor and treat this collection as a playlist: write down the names of these great tracks, then buy them from other collections of Stevie Wonder's hits!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I love to see if I can improve my coordination plus I love the piano even though I could not learn how to play the real thing.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love playing bingo blitz and I love that I can take it with me on my Kindle fire. I wish they would update it to include more rooms, slots, and the daily tournament! They have started updating the version on my Android phone but seem really slow on the kindle version. Once it has all the updates I would give it 5 stars. As it is, it is a little boring.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Usually Harry does some good detective work but in this book he makes some deductions that are just too far fetched.
B00A11AN6O|2.0|I can't say I have even attampted to use it.  Can't see where I'll ever have the need to store photo's for a kindle in this location.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|It's awesome. My favorite new album in a long time, by my favorite new artist in a long time. Buy it.
B0027BOL4G|1.0|Food, Inc. (Robert Kenner, 2008)<br /><br />You know, I really thought that Michael Moore was going to be the absolute worst filmmaker I could ever be exposed to, a kind of halfwit court jester who diesn't realize he stopped being funny long ago, if indeed he ever was.  Unfortunately, Moore's baffling popularity has spawned imitators who don't seem to have glommed onto the fact that Moore at least did have a sense of humor, however questionable. Enter TV documentarian Robert Kenner, turning in his first big-screen feature, a ridiculous piece of one-sided propaganda that barely warrants the term \\"documentary\\", and I say this as someone who entrely agrees with all but two of the points being made here (more on that later).<br /><br />Plot: factory farming is bad, mmmkay? And the evil megacorps who practice it are bent on taking over the world, no matter the cost in human and animal misery, muhahahahahahahahahaaaa!<br /><br />Yes, I'm serious. The main difference between Monsanto and Gru (the main character in the delightful animated film Despicable Me) is that Gru eventually grows a heart. But I guaran-damn-tee you, if Robert Kenner could have found a way to work in some sort of unsubstantiated allegation that Monsanto, like Gru, had hatched an attempt to steal the moon, he'd have thrown it in here. This is a guy with a chip in his shoulder, a very big one. He's got a life-sized grudge against big corporations, whether they be restaurant chains (McDonald's, of course, is singled out), big-box stores (while the film provides a pretty comprehensive list, of course you know he's specifically going after Wal-Mart), factory farmers (Monsanto, blah blah blah) and their lobbyists, and the government, who are needless to say puppets dancing to the megacorps' tune. And like I said at the top of the hour, you know what? I agree with him about most of this. I'm as anti-factory-farm and pro-locavore as the next guy. And I teared up at Keith Kowalcyk's story just like pretty much everyone else who watched this movie--though I wonder if Barbara Kowalcyk understood the terrible irony of her statement that she doesn't want pity, she just wants people to listen, when half the movie that's just gone by is all about inciting people to pity in order to soften them up for Kenner ramming his message into the frontal lobes of his viewers with all the subtlety of a captive bolt pistol (google that if you don't know what it is, but here's two hints: it was Javier Bardem's character's favorite murder weapon in No Country for Old Man, and it is very germane to this discussion).<br /><br />As for those two places where Kenner got it horribly, horribly wrong, as a side discussion: first off, the long stream of text at the end of the film, which is put there just in case you, the viewer, are too stupid to have gotten all the bullet points while, you know, actually watching the movie, starts off with an exhortation to buy organic. This despite having shown us a scene less than twenty minutes before of the CEO of Stonyfield Farms ushering a rep from a prospective buyer around an organic foods fest, pointing out all of the companies represented there that are now parts of megacorps. (\\"Kashi is Kellogg's?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"I didn't know that.\\") They seem to be taking an \\"any regulation is better than no regulation\\" tack in making this exhortation, as so many people do (you will see \\"buy organic and only organic!\\" advice in at least half the diet books published in the past ten years), but the simple truth of the matter is that the guidelines for a product being certified organic by the American government are not only lax, but constantly shifting. The movie opens with a brief discussion of how the American public is misled by companies having images of farmers and red barns and all that malarkey on their products... and then at the end of the movie the filmmakers are allowing themselves to be misled by that damn-close-to-meaningless \\"certified organic\\" label in exactly the same way, and because they're offering themselves up as skeptics, they're duping you into the same boat. Take a different piece of advice from that text stream: buy local, instead (and while you're at it, watch the vastly superior locavore documentary that came out soon after this, Ingredients.)<br /><br />Second: in yet another piece of knee-jerk-reaction-dom, and one that has very quickly become almost as prevalent as the \\"buy organic!\\" scam, these guys are of course anti-GMO. And that is a much, much, much longer discussion than the one above, one that we don't really have time for here, but I have commented on it at length in other reviews (most explicitly in my review of Vegan Cooking for Dummies, q.v.). To lay it out as briefly as possible, it's ridiculous, and arbitrary, to attack GMO and embrace \\"certified organic\\" when they both have exactly the same amount of research done on them vis-a-vis risks and benefits of consumption. It shows a kind of selective blindness that should raise red flags in your head--though with this documentary, those flags should already be up and waving long before you get to the GMO section.<br /><br />I think the film industry needs to adopt the same standards the book industry did a decade or so ago, when the rise of the memoir caused book publishers to create an entirely separate category that is now known as \\"creative nonfiction\\" to distinguish things that are actually true from things that are seen through rose-colored, jaundice-colored, or psychedelia-colored lenses a la Augusten Burroughs/James Frey/Elie Wiesel/etc. Food, Inc. falls firmly into whatever category they would decide to create; it is nonfiction, but it is so one-sided that you can't help but wonder how much the filmmakers massaged the data, how many editorial tricks were used on the footage, how many interviews were left on the cutting-room floor in order to make sure that anything that might have made this film balanced was excised. It's offensive--and again, I say this as someone who agrees with almost every premise presented here. Actually, now that I think about it, the fact that I agree with them makes it even worse. ½he same way, and because they're offering themselves up as skeptics, they're duping you into the same boat. Take a different piece of advice from that text stream: buy local, instead (and while you're at it, watch the vastly superior locavore documentary that came out soon after this, Ingredients.)<br /><br />Second: in yet another piece of knee-jerk-reaction-dom, and one that has very quickly become almost as prevalent as the \\"buy organic!\\" scam, these guys are of course anti-GMO. And that is a much, much, much longer discussion than the one above, one that we don't really have time for here, but I have commented on it at length in other reviews (most explicitly in my review of Vegan Cooking for Dummies, q.v.). To lay it out as briefly as possible, it's ridiculous, and arbitrary, to attack GMO and embrace \\"certified organic\\" when they both have exactly the same amount of research done on them vis-a-vis risks and benefits of consumption. It shows a kind of selective blindness that should raise red flags in your head--though with this documentary, those flags should already be up and waving long before you get to the GMO section.<br /><br />I think the film industry needs to adopt the same standards the book industry did a decade or so ago, when the rise of the memoir caused book publishers to create an entirely separate category that is now known as \\"creative nonfiction\\" to distinguish things that are actually true from things that are seen through rose-colored, jaundice-colored, or psychedelia-colored lenses a la Augusten Burroughs/James Frey/Elie Wiesel/etc. Food, Inc. falls firmly into whatever category they would decide to create; it is nonfiction, but it is so one-sided that you can't help but wonder how much the filmmakers massaged the data, how many editorial tricks were used on the footage, how many interviews were left on the cutting-room floor in order to make sure that anything that might have made this film balanced was excised. It's offensive--and again, I say this as someone who agrees with almost every premise presented here. Actually, now that I think about it, the fact that I agree with them makes it even worse. ½
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love this book as well as the movie. I wish the Twilight Saga didn't end at all. Everyone should read the book as well.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|I was looking forward to see this movie. But it is like they did not even try. How can you get bored during an action movie? Well, I did.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|A charming story that captures the innocence and youthful wanderlust of nomadic and gypsy souls. Delightful to see the misunderstood find understanding in love because of and despite differences. LOVED it.
B00275EGWY|5.0|One of the best war movies I've seen.Entertaining from start to finish.This movie will have you at the edge of your seat.Gripping and some intense moments.Jeremey Renner does an outstanding job.I can't believe the low rating on this film.It's a masterpeice.I rarely ever give a movie 5 stars and especially not a war movie but this movie captivated me.Give it a chance.You might just be blown away by this movie too!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I was so excited that you were releasing an album! Couldn't wait order, which I did as a pre-release order. Counted the days for release and shipping. I love it and can see the videos that go along with the songs in my minds eye. I recommend it to everyone!
B004GVUPFE|5.0|It is very simply--FUN! No numbers, no letters, no time limit. Just relaxing play. Reviews should not DEMAND a certain number of words.
1609611543|3.0|not much new, not what i thought it would be, seems like a tipical diet book and i was looking for something else.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The only thing I can say in this book's defense is a) it's a first novel, and b) the author is pretty good at capturing the nuances of Irish dialogue. Beyond that, the plot drags and all the emotional descriptions in the book run along the lines of &#34;...all the old fears rose up in him: fear of change, of circumstances, of other people, of women, of intimacy. In short, fear of all that might make his life better.&#34; Great. Please show me. Don't tell me.<br />If you're looking for something to pass the time on a flight, go ahead and buy this book. If you're looking for another world to fall into, read something else.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|i thought it was a good family movie i like these kind of movies i wish they would make more
B00005K3OT|2.0|I like the movie.  It is the quality that was the problem.  It came skipping and ended up freezing my dvd player.  Tried putting in a different movie, the other movie played perfectly fine.  This particular dvd is just faulty.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|not enough batman in movie, looked like it was a leadin for a new guy to play batman i liked christian bale
B009VB97EY|5.0|The only thing good about this movie it the fact Channing Tantum is hot. Other then that terrible movie. lol But I will give it 5 stars.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Wow I must say after waiting entirely too long to see this film it has gone to the top of my list of favorite movies. It was absolutely horrifying and amazing all at the same time. This movie had my emotions and mind running in overdrive. Spielberg shows an amazing display of creativity by giving a mostly black and white display of the horror history brought to the Jews. I honestly felt connected and disgusted as if the acts displayed were right in front of me. Liam Neeson is amazing in his character that you learn to love and hate simultaneously throughout the film. For instance he is a man that serves and works for the most horrifying leaders in history, the German Nazis. He is a womanizer, a racist, and war profiteer, abusive and powerful man in one respect right up until he decides to become a hero. It goes to show that through all of the hate, killings and heinous ruling  that the German leaders inflicted upon their people there were some that were strong enough and willed to fight for what was right. Based on a true story this film will have you turn your head on many terrible crimes committed by a man as he will sacrifice himself, his life and his resources to save the lives of 1100 Jews. Creating an emotional bond between the viewers, these Jews that you want so dearly to survive die to the sacrifice being made and for a man that is considered a Nazi. I know that there are many war movies and documentaries on the war, the holocaust and the horrifying experiences of the Jews but none are coming close to displaying the reality of the people than this movie. My all-time favorite part as I am sure for many is watching the horrible things the Germans had done backfire in their face as they fled away defeated. I will definitely watch it again maybe two or three times more in my life as I share it with others as it is an experience in its self.
B008CP93S0|1.0|That by far was the worse movie Jennifer every made. I watch the previews of Chelsea lately and they promoted it to be the funniest movie that year. Boy, were they wrong.
B001706I5I|5.0|my granddaughter actually got this to watch and she loves it. i watched it with her and it is a very cute movie.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|OMG I laughed my head off. For starters, I love Channing Tantum and not for his acting. But I loved his role in this movie. Awesome begining but end was pretty cheezy.
B00000AFWW|5.0|I am not a grunge fan, but this is clearly a great rock album.<br /><br />Catchy and straight pretty melodies. Evocative lyrics - personal sounding and convincing. Courtney raw rock chick feel.<br /><br />It's well produced without losing personality. So, while I prefer the insane Pretty on the Inside, this is pretty on the outside in a way that does not take away its inner beauty.<br /><br />Obvious stand out tracks:<br /><br />a) Malibu, b) Northern Light, c) Dying, d) celebrity skin... wait, half the album is outstanding, and no song is less than good.
B008AWBQGW|5.0|This last Skynyrd is not as good as \\"God & Guns\\" but is a pretty good record.  I find myself liking the slower songs more than the rockers, I am getting dangerously close to fifty, but the general feeling is positive. I think my favorite song for now is \\"\\"Something to live for\\" but that could change. \\"\\"One day at a time\\", \\"Ready to fly\\" and \\"Honey Hole\\" I like a lot. The record improves with time. High number of  fine songs. As for the ongoing debate, definitely not the best Skynyrd  out there, Ronnie is not coming back and this is what we have. Happy to be able to listen what they produce, happy to take it \\"one day at a time\\". I hope this helps someone.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved it! So much passion, made me wish I was Megan at times!  Then at the same time it made me mad & hurt that he could do women that way.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I bought this cd a few weeks before taking a trip to Utah. After driving five hours through a snowstorm, it was 1:00 am when we hit the heaviest part of the storm. We were exhausted and didn't know if we would make it to our destination. We put in other cds, but those made us drowsy or irritated. We put in this cd and we woke right up, our nerves relaxed and we were able to drive safely through the snowstorm to our destination. All other cds threatened to put us to sleep, but this inspiring, beautiful cd literally got us through the storm.
0307595579|5.0|Bought this for a friend who had not read the books. This is a truly beautiful boxed set, full of fabulously written books by a wonderful author; almost had to keep this for myself
1419705849|5.0|GREAT BOOK. MY SON ALWAYS HAS TO HAVE THE NEXT DIARY OF A WIMPY KID BOOK. I DON'T THINK HE VOLUNTARILY READS ANYTHING ELSE. THAT IS ALL I HEAR IS GIGGLING FOR LIKE TWO DAYS STRAIGHT. FUNNY STUFF!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The beginning how things came to be was a bit different but everything else was the same. The whole book i thought the \\"hero\\" was too perfect and I am not sure what I thought about the \\"heroine\\". Its an decent quick read but i was hoping for something else.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|love Bruno Mars and can't wait for the next CD to come out. he is the artist of the century!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|After listening and watching these guys perform on YouTube, I didn't miss my chance to purchase a copy of one of their first albums. These guys are fantastic! My kids and I love them - We've been waiting a long time for this!<br /><br />The Piano Guys are a talented and dedicated group of professionals... Jon Schmidt plays the piano, Steven Nelson plays the cello, and the other three - Paul Anderson, Tel Stewart and Al van der Beek - are the other supportive members of the group. They play a mix of Classical-type music with Pop and have been known to go to great lengths to produce their amazing music and videos... such as air-lifting an expensive new grand piano to the middle of the freezing cold, snowy arctic in the dark hours of the night, or onto the ledge of a 1000 ft. cliff, overlooking the arid plains of Utah! The scenes they've chosen are truly inspiring and spectacular to behold! I encourage you to check out their videos and watch them!<br /><br />One of my favorite songs on the album is \\"What Makes You Beautiful\\". It was amazing to watch all 5 guys playing around on the same piano!<br /><br />I wish \\"The Piano Guys\\" every great happiness and success, and I look forward to seeing what they do next!<br /><br />You can find more about the Piano Guys at their Homepage, located here: [...]
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Its awesome and take all my time playing in it. Maybe next time you could make one with guns or other stufff
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Good free app. easy to use. I recommend it and use it on a regular basis when I am traveling
B0054X3FQO|4.0|I am amazed by the potential talent of people, especially the author of this book, Miranda Kerr. It is beyond my imagination to see one person for many roles: a mother, a model, an entrepreneur and a writer. Miranda seems close to her fans throughout this book, when she talks about her ups and downs in her life, the method she treats herself when she is in bad mood, etc. After reading &#34;Treasure yourself&#34;, I feel grateful for what I have now, and start to treasure myself more :)
1582701709|2.0|I do not agree with the message this book generates \\"you don't need to try, just think\\".<br /><br />I agree one should be positive to attract positive, but effort is still required in every aspect of life. Get real :) (smiley face)
B001NZVS8E|5.0|Best Album Blink Ever Made In My Opinion. Bought A Copy When I was Like 10 And Lost It, After Years Of Searching For It. I Caved And Rebought It....Been Listening To It For Days Straight
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|When I miss an episode, it is so nice to be able to just log onto amazon and get the episode immediately there! And it's cheap!
B00932AA5G|5.0|nice movie, worth a watch, with English subtitles, keeps you on the edge of your seat. With this film that I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.
B008Z9L94O|3.0|A five star album to be sure.  I have fond memories of the mid nineties and this album.<br />I was a mere 13 years old in 1995 and my  brother was in college and let me hear this album.<br /><br />This vinyl edition is beautifully packaged and is really amazing with its art direction.<br />The sound however is the true  test and the only reason to buy this album again.<br />The sound at times is good and at others seems weak.  The worst sounding songs seem to be on the first LP.<br /><br />I didn't experience noise or clicks as others describe, but I always clean new records before playing.<br /><br />In this remasters defence, I listened to the original cd recently and thought the sound left something to be desirerd.
B005HSL626|1.0|i have tried to open this game and havent been able to open it! so far i have no opinion.
B00280LYIC|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. My new second favorite book! I'm definitely getting the rest of the series!!-
B00005B3Z6|5.0|Needed the first season to finish the series this is a great series i am so glad it finally came out on dvd for us all to enjoy.
B008BDZOZY|4.0|It's always great to hear David Byrne back working with new versions of classical pop forms.  This is one for the fans, and there should be many more of them.  The brass backup is pure genius.  The songs have craft and spark.  A very, very fine record from masters old and new.
B0038AUYKU|5.0|Having read four of the Wallander novels so far this is close to being the best. Getting the killer's viewpoint works very well and the ending is affecting.
B004EPYZSK|2.0|I'm sorry.  There are great actors in this, but...are we asleep?  When a big part of the premise of the plot ends with a character saying \\"I don't know?\\"...  Ummm.  Why are aliens stealing gold out of the Old West?  \\"I don't know.\\"  If they're so smart, why didn't they go to China, where there are much smarter civilizations to plunder with lots more gold?  Sorry.  Stereotypes?  The \\"good\\" Native Americans who only want our scalps on their off hours.  The excuse that this nonsense was in the comic book doesn't really cut the baloney nor the mustard.  Avoid this one, except...<br /><br />Paul Dano.  Now that man doesn't walk through a part.  He was phenomenal in Little Miss Sunshine, and he is great here as the rustler's son who is working through, shall we say, so many layers of homoeroticism that it takes more than one palm to count.  He's really brilliant.  And, it is good to see him in a movie that doesn't end with him doing a poetry or fiction reading at Starlight Bookstore in Los Feliz!  Or wherever.<br /><br />Dano is the goods.  The rest of this movie is, well, fool's gold.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Piano guys are amazing and I love this cd, cant wait til we they get more out.  My kids love to listen to them and we find ourselves listening to the cd and the you tube videos over and over.  Their music is fabulous!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Reaching to all audiences, this album ROCKS!! I love the arrangements and it is a great listen, and if you haven't seen their videos, then get on over to their YouTube channel. Thanks Piano Guys for sharing your talents.
B0087ZG7FC|5.0|Scarface tells the story of immigrant gangster Tony Montana; his rise to power as a powerful and fearless drug dealer, and his rapid fall as a paranoid and overconfident kingpin. Scarface is truly an iconic and memorable gangster film. There are several scenes that will stay with you forever; for example, the infamous bathroom/chainsaw scene, the intense assassination attempt on a journalist, and the epic shootout at the end; however, there are many, many more. The dialogue is packed with quotables thanks to Al Pacino's great performance and accent in this film; if this is your first time viewing, you'll be quoting Tony's lines for days after. (\\"Say hello to my little friend!\\") The film also has great music that matches its overall atmosphere and tone; I loved the film's soundtrack. I know some people can see this as an inspirational film, while others see it as a cautionary tale; it's completely up to the type of person you are and how seriously you take it, though.<br /><br />I own the Universal's 100th Anniversary version of the Blu-ray. There is one disc for the blu-ray, one disc for the DVD, and a code pamphlet that comes with Ultraviolet and iTunes digital copy codes. This version also comes (came) with a slipcover. The picture and sound quality were great, better than my DVD.<br /><br />Overall, Scarface is an amazing crime/gangster film; it's unforgettable thanks to the hypnotizing performances, memorable dialogue, and the action sequences. I highly recommend purchasing.<br /><br />Scarface has strong blood and violence, excessive drug use, and nudity.
0316227706|5.0|I am not the type to purchase a coffee table book, not even at a yard sale for $.50 but I had to have this book not many things bring a smile like this book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is well written, creative, and very suspenseful. I could not put it down. Amazing Amy is one of the best characters I have read in a long time.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I love this show and found the special features very neat! I am so glad I purchased this season's DVD!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|100 times better than the movie.  Great details of all the planning and stress that went into this mission.  Forget giving Obama credit after reading this.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|I love this show and found the special features very neat! I am so glad I purchased this season's DVD!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This entire album makes me want to practice my piano more. This has taken music where it needs to be.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I love this show and found the special features very neat! I am so glad I purchased this season's DVD!!
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|Everytime I try to download this, it gets to about 50-60% and then errors out. I try again and it starts from scratch. I have been trying to download this since I saw it on 12/2/12 daily. I am connected to both wifi and 3g. Gonna try the Google version now.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I love this show and found the special features very neat! I am so glad I purchased this season's DVD!!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|One of the great movies of the last several years, the performances are epic, and the storyline goes beyond the basic &#34;superhero saves the world&#34; theme. The blu-ray is a good deal in comparison to other high definition discs, and it highlights the scenes of the movie in a way that you cannot enjoy without the fine details. Certainly worth upgrading even if you already have the DVD, especially at the price.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love that she makes you work it....its hard, but you get results that is for sure!!! Can't wait to lose more!
B00006FDCJ|5.0|The best western ever . . . . . . okay, Tombstone still is my first choice for a rousing good time.  This a wonderful, unvarnished look without any romanticism.  Love it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys do an excellent job.  You can hear their passion and love of music. Every piece is filled with creativity and originality while at the same time honoring the original composers and artists.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Best Angry Birds yet.  Fun on the Kindle. Well done and the sounds of StarWars with the new weapons rocks.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I had seen the movie before finding out it was a book, and bought it as soon as I could.  Diana Wynne Jones has created a magical world in which nothing is questioned, but just accepted.  The time period is foggy, but vivid in detail.  The characters are wonderfully charming and have a life of their own, none needing anymore than what has been imagined by the author.  I wish I had more words to describe how great this is.  It is a quick read that left me wanting for more -in a good way.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|This one was just an excuse for Tim Burton to put heavy makeup on Depp.  The best part was that the movie wasn't longer.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|I use use this processor with my [[ASIN:B009F1DTZI ASUS AMD A85X MicroATX DDR3 2400 370 Motherboards F2A85-M/CSM]]. I submitted a review for it which is equally meaningful for this APU. I pasted some of that review here.<br /><br />Fast Chip...<br />I built a tower with this board, AMD A8-5600K APU 3.6Ghz quad-core apu (accelerated processor unit, analogous to cpu with AMD's new chipset architecture), [[ASIN:B007A1TISC Komputerbay 16GB (2x 8GB) DDR3 PC3-12800 1600MHz DIMM with Blue Low Profile Heatspreaders 240-Pin Dual / Quad Channel RAM Desktop Memory KIT 10-10-10-27 XMP ready]], Windows 8 Pro, and a pair of [[ASIN:B004W2JKZI Crucial m4 128GB 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive SATA 6Gb/s CT128M4SSD2]]. Its fast!<br /><br />Overclocking...<br />My A8 apu was overclocked to 4.2 Ghz. I'm sure it would oc higher, but just didn't feel the need to do so. With my stock configuration, it runs at 3.8 Ghz.<br /><br />Multi-Display...<br />This mobo ships with on-board AMD Radeon 7650D(when combined with AMD Trinity apu)graphics and AMD Eyefinity. This allowed me to attach two 1080p monitors (1 hdmi+ 1 dvi) to my machine without any additional graphics cards installed.<br /><br />Future Processors Sharing FM2 Platform (Upgradability)...<br />This board is built around the FM2 socket. While researching FM2, it became apparent that AMD has several sockets simultaneously active on the market,(FM1,FM2, AM3+). I found that uncertainty in regards to whether or not FM2 would have future processors was the source of some bad reviews for boards and processors in the platform. It appears that AMD plans to continue developing around the AM3+ and FM2 sockets for most of 2013 while selling the last of the FM1 processors during Q4 2012.
0767812387|5.0|I have watched this movie several times already. I saw it first on TV then decided I had to have it. The dancing, the cast, the story it tells is all<br />great.  This one is a keeper for anyone, so please don't pass it up
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|It's so far the darkest, fantastic Batman sequel yet. Bane is right up there with the Joker as one of the most vile villains to appear.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Normally I don't carry my calculator around all the time. But even outside of school and homework this app is still very helpful.
B004U52VPS|3.0|This is a pretty basic game for Angry Birds.  There are not many configurations you can REALLY do.  My son hasn't really played with it much. (7 years old)
B006YC74E8|5.0|Best photo app out there for kindle fire hd. It works perfectly, and not just can it edit photos but now you have a great camera and picture editor for free.
B005HSL626|4.0|THIS GAME ACTUALLY HAS IMPROVED MY SPEED AND REACTION TIMES. VERY ADDICTIVE. GREAT GAME AND QUICK RESPONSE TIMES NEEDED TO CONTINUE PLAY.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love the game so far. its not what I thought it would be but I like it more then I should
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is usually thought of as a chick flick, but I have to admit that I, a guy, enjoyed it.  There is a lot of very funny and subtle humor that carries over from the original book (a great read).  Bingley and Darcy are very well cast.  Lizzy (Keira Knightly) is way too cute (the book says her strength is her mind, not her looks), but Keira plays it to near-perfection.  There are long dramatic pauses that are unnecessary, and the time would have been better spent on including more of the original storyline.  If you like action, fights, car chases and bathroom humor, try a different movie.  If you can appreciate subtle humor and dialog, you'll enjoy this.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|The CD is OK, but I really like Diana Krall singing jazz instead of rockabilly/New Orleansy type music.  What is she trying to be with that CD cover?
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I knew before I bought this album that it would be perfection, so when I got Take Me Home, I was completely overjoyed. The boys have done it again and the tracks are sensational. I would suggest buying the Target edition, as there are a few more tracks that are offered on it. I literally listen to their album every day. It's THAT good!
B007MDB71O|5.0|I saw this in the theater when it was first released and I throughly enjoyed it. As so many others have mentioned, the marketing job was horribly botched and frankly, the movie title was just a mistake, \\"John Carter of Mars\\" would have made much more sense.<br /><br />But, the movie itself was great fun. I bought it on Blu-Ray recently and have watched it twice so far and enjoyed it each time...it's just a fun old time adventure and it looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Scott Jurek wrote his story in a way that gives the reader a good idea of how he got to be a great ultramarathoner and great ambassador for vegetarian athletes. His childhood was not an easy one but also not unlike many others childhood. The difference is that he didn't let life or physical obstacles get in the way of his goal. I had already read &#34;Born to Run&#34; so this was another piece of the puzzle. The recipes were great and as a vegetarian triathlete who considers themselves more of a runner, I will definitely use some of them.
B005AERS74|5.0|I am a fan of Maroon 5 and the first one to get the records. This is my first music purchase from Amazon and I loved the experience. It was fast and effortless above all the MP3 cloud enables me to play the purchased music from any device.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been following this group for a while now and just LOVE this album.  If you love VSQ, you'll easily fall in love with the Piano Guys and their Cellist.  :)
B005HIREJK|5.0|Got this watch for my cousin and he is a watch collector. It is comparable to Casio watch of the same category. The finish is very good and the dial has a good looks because of the three dial.
0140274111|5.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's is a true work of art. A brilliant use of words in such a short space. If you liked the movie, another iconic masterpiece of the time, you'll love the novel. Truman Capote is a mastermind; Holly Golightly is a star. How do we know where and with whom we belong?<br />Read it.
B005NJ2K6U|1.0|I do not know if this is because of Amazon Appstore or not, but my progress keeps on getting lost. One time while commuting to work (underground) it said I could not open the app without being connected to the internet. I had never gotten that issue before. Anywho, later when I got above ground I opened the games to see that all my progress was gone. I was a little annoyed, but it was ok since I didn't achieve my goal of getting 100% perfect on all levels.<br /><br />One week later, I open the app and I see that ALL my progress is gone AGAIN. I was just playing it a few hours ago. I have no idea what is going on. Now it's just annoying to know that I cannot keep track of my progress when I play this game. I never had an issue with this before and I don't know why it keeps happening.<br /><br />It's a shame because I've enjoyed playing this game on and off for the past year as a predictable puzzle-type game that I can play quickly in between trains or homework assignments.
B0088WK6CE|5.0|I've been a fan of Glen Hansard since 'Once'. He shines as a solo artist, as well. I heard him sing 'High Hope' during his appearance on the show 'Parenthood', and immediately ran a search that led me to this album. I'm listening to it often these days, and know that it will be a timeless keeper.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is a great Grisham book, and I enjoyed it immensely. But be prepared--it is so convoluted and rather difficult to follow, e.g. multiple trips out of the country for the protagonist; complicated financial dealings, etc.  Fun, but hard to follow.  Just requires some imagination to believe all of the antics!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book gave me everything I needed to publish on Kindle.  Step by step easy instructions guided me along and I have already started posting my books.  Thanks!
B004HX4RT6|4.0|I've only played a handful of games on it so far, but it seems pretty cool.  I haven't found any major flaws that have made me want to uninstall it yet.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great Bible resource. It is easy to use and has great Bible study tools! And best of all it is free! Beginning Bible students as well as Bible scholars will benefit from this app.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love being able to watch where ever I am at, ESP since I'm never home when it airs. Totally convenient
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Since it's really hard to watch YouTube videos while driving, I bought the MP3 version of this album to listen to in my car.  It's perfect to listen to when I want something just a little mellow, but energizing.  I highly recommend you check them out online and find out what they're all about.

I am not a fan of outsourcing or buying items from outside the US. You need to give a clear indication of where your company resides.

1619691825|4.0|This review is for the unabridged audiobook version. I've pretty much listened to or read every Nelson DeMille book. The John Corey character is one of DeMille's best--he's got all the toughness, swagger and political incorrectness you want in a mostly real-life action protagonist, but he usually tempers all that with humor, a strong moral code, intelligence, experience and dare I say sensitivity (it's there if you look or listen hard enough). And much of the swagger and political incorrectness are actually internal--the bulk of his wisecracks and jokes are only between him and the listener/reader. Anyway, the guy is pretty complex for a terrorist thriller type book. But the last two Corey books before The Panther--Wildfire and The Lion were disappointing to me. The plots and action seemed pretty far-fetched and Corey's character seemed more forced--like all those disparate pieces of his personality didn't mesh to make him the guy we liked so much in Plum Island, The Lion and Night Fall.<br /><br />In The Panther Corey is back and more amusing and interesting than ever. The plot is reasonably believable and the setting in Yemen is perfect. Some have criticized the Yemen setting, but it's genius:it's a real place, but it's so alien to most of DeMille's readers that he can pretty much say anything he wants about the country and what might happen there. I actually found some of the more objective historical and cultural info on Yemen fascinating, and then was perfectly happy to believe whatever DeMille told us about the the socio-economic, political and geographical that facilitates the action in the book. The story's actually believable in Yemen, where it never would have worked in the US (maybe that's one of the reasons I found the last two Corey books to be a bit too far-fetched).<br /><br />A nice bonus in The Panther is the appearance of Paul Brenner, another of DeMille's memorable characters and strong enough to complement Corey without upstaging him. Actually, there's no way to upstage Corey because the book is all from his perspective, so it's all about John Corey and what he's thinking. Everyone else is filtered through Corey and sometimes that can make the other characters seem a little two-dimensional (just by comparison). Brenner provides a bit of a good-guy foil for Corey with his own humorous arsenal of irreverent, ironic,and sarcastic quips; and his attraction to Corey's wife Kate (even if most or all of that is in Corey's mind).<br /><br />The audiobook is narrated by Scott Brick, a prolific, highly effective and versatile narrator who has become the undisputed &#34;voice of John Corey&#34; over the course of the last several books. Brick's voice and cadences capture all of the personality of Corey without going over the top or getting in the way of the narrative. As I noted, the book is told from Corey's perspective, but other characters do have dialogue and Brick is especially good at modulating his voice to delineate individual characters without breaking the natural bounds of his own vocal timbre. Many narrators (even generally very good ones) make women and children sound odd, upping the vocal pitch or exaggerating cadence or modulation, but Brick is a master and always a pleasure to listen to. The audiobook is 19 hours long. I listened mostly in the car and would actually look for excuses to go out to drive somewhere so I could listen some more. When the book was done it was like a good friend had gone away.

Can't wait to pass it on to my husband who will like the fact that it is a quick read that's also interesting and fun.  A nice Christmas gift especially for a man who works hard and likes to read for relaxation and enjoyment.

0385536828|4.0|\\"Sweet Tooth\\" is a very well written, interesting book; it has a clever ending, nicely foreshadowed,  and a bit of a mystery which is resolved with no loose ends.  While I would recommend the novel, it was not fully satisfying.  The problem is that the protagonist finds it too easy to get deeply involved with men , so that ultimately it becomes difficult to take her romantic travails too seriously (although in \\"real\\" life I know such a person and can fully sympathize).<br /><br /> I had one minor question.  When Serena is discussing authors with Tom (p.175) she is being honest - wouldn't it give Tom cause to wonder how she could like his work given her tastes?<br /><br /> Spoiler alert.  At the end, in an ironic twist, it is the novelist who spies on people's lives for material who is more of a culprit in dehumanizing experience than the paid spies.  The ending was nicely foreshadowed by Tom's story of the married couple, in which the husband discovers his wife's crime, but does not tell her, even while planning to leave her.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|It's a well written book, in which Scott shows us his philosophy on running and the vegan lifestyle. Liked the part on his relationship with Dusty Olson!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Every bit of the trilogy is absorbing and you can't put It down! I'm sad to not have  anything  to look forward too after my son  in bed, but I feel complete over the beautiful ending. The first book scared me at the ending, making me feeling empty- that's how captivating this trilogy is! Thank you E.L. James for opening my senses again!
1416550518|5.0|Best story I've read in a long time.  I  know she must have done loads of research, and it certainly paid off.  Fascinating tale of life upstairs and downstairs in class-conscious England before and after the Great War. The plot is rather intricate, though not hard to follow, and kept me in suspense to the very end.  Loved this book, and plan to read her others.  Good character development.
0385340540|3.0|I think Grisham fell in love with Italy. He had to come up with a plot that involved Italy so espionage became the genre. Naturally, the story is contrived and pointless. China launching state of the art satellites to monitor the world in secret has not been confirmed but very much suspected. So beginning of the plot was believable and engaging. Politics surrounding pardon and CIA's decision to turn him loose in Italy was OK. But CIA paying for his language lessons? Why? Giving him allowances? Really? Backman outsmarting the world's best assassins? I don't think so. However, Grisham published \\"Playing for Pizza\\" in 2007. He expressed his love for Italy and for the people who live their life doing what they love to do, not wasting their time worshipping money. So in a way, my review here could be pointless as well. This is not Grisham's best but still can pass as a book that can kill your time.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|No one could do this better than the piano guys. I've been listening for over a year now and haven't been disappointed yet! Keep it up!
B0086700CM|5.0|Really like this app. It's fun and just a tad bit addicting. I have it on the kindle fire and my ipod and both versions work well. I Aldo like that it isn't too easy so it doesn't get boring. Love this app!

B005LAII1C|5.0|Saw this movie in the theater and laughed so hard my face hurt by the end. If you are into raunchy, foul mouthed comedy (and who isn't) then pick up a copy you won't be disappointed.....added bonus..........Mila Kunis hi HOT!!!!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The book was cute, but not spectacular- not scary at all.  I was interested in the physical book at first, but the publisher was cheap on paper so the text was printed way too far into the gutter for it to be a comfortable read.  I got the Kindle version instead which sacrifices the images.  I really wish there was a way to zoom into imaged text on the Kindle.  There is not much imaged text but it becomes illegible on the Kindle.
B000009ED0|4.0|I have been meaning to get this for a while as the copy from my early twenties went through a helluva beating. A great CD and in my opinion hid best work.

B005CAAXXM|5.0|As a big fan of prog rock and metal, from classics like Pink Floyd, Yes, and King Crimson to newer acts like Porcupine Tree, Pain of Salvation, and The Pineapple Thief, I was looking for something new to try on. Having already played all of Porcupine Tree's albums on repeat, I wanted a breath of fresh air but was still craving that modern approach and heavy energy to prog that some of the 60s and 70s bands just can't provide.<br /><br />Leprous stepped in with flying colors. The musicians are talented and their work is unique and enjoyable; the melodies are creative and will loop in your head for days, and the breakdowns are headbangingly satisfying. After buying this album I quickly picked up Tall Poppy Syndrome as well and have been trying desperately to find Aeolia, I only wish that Leprous had more albums to offer because I cannot get enough.<br /><br />Let it be noted that this album is HEAVY. It is definitely metal, and heard best at loud volume (and on a good sound system). I am not usually a fan of growling (except for Opeth, sometimes) but it does not bother me at all on this record, and I'd encourage others who feel similarly to step out of their comfort zones and give this one a whirl.<br /><br />I am a prog metal lover for the sake of prog, not for the sake of metal, and this band and album scratched my itch perfectly. 5 stars.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Awesome series, I would recommend for adults only however. They did a great job with the replacement of spartacus, (still sad).

B0027MJU00|4.0|easy read - I love how Gillian writes and makes you really get to know the characters (even if they are unlikable!) I've read Dark Places, Sharp Objects and Gone Girl (my favorite) and I can't wait for more! I really like how she got into the details of this horrific crime - all of her books have twists I don't see coming which I love.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys have done it again! This album is wonderful, it is so great to see music that can be fantastic and clean at the same time. I would highly recommend this album to anyone!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I grew up on classical music, so I have always loved the genre.  The Piano Guys bring new life and a new twist to some old favorites.  I could listen to \\"The Cello Song\\" and \\"Moonlight\\" over and over and over.  Oh, wait, I HAVE!  I also enjoy their cover of some new modern songs, my favorite being \\"A Thousand Years\\".  Absolutely beautiful.  I look forward to more of their work and future albums.  I hope they make a cover for \\"O Holy Night\\" in a future Christmas album and I think The Script's song \\"Hall of Fame\\" would be beautifully done by these guys (especially since I only like the melody of the song, lol!). I hope they are around for a very long time!

B006LSZECO|5.0|What a crazy ride this book takes you on! This was this month's selection for our book club. Beautifully written and twists around every turn. I loved that it was told in diary form from one perspective and then bounced back to real time.  It caused quite a stir in our discussion. None of us were happy with the ending, however. This is one you have to read. It moves fast, in fact, you can't put it down!

B006TVQU6C|2.0|Not only doesn't my motherboard support the USB 3.0 necessary to use the two front panel USB sockets (without a PCI adaptor), but after I plugged in the HD Audio plug from the front panel to my motherboard, suddenly I have no sound except from the front panel speaker socket!?!? It took me two days of searching for a solution, uninstalling, reinstalling, rolling back and downloading drivers, a bad dream and reinstalling the operating system, twice, and an upgrade to Windows 8 before I realized that maybe, if I disconnected the HD Audio plug and put the two little blue jumpers on the correct sockets on the motherboard, between 5&6 and 8&9, then maybe, yes, it worked, I now have audio from the rear panel. And none from the front. The Antec 300 case, my other case, has the AC'97 audio plug, which does not disable rear audio when plugged into the motherboard. In conclusion, the only thing that works for me on the front panel is the power button and reset button and I have a long thick cable from the two USB ports and an HD Audio wire that have to be rolled up and stored above the DVD drive.

B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Liam Neeson is an incredible actor!! Very deep and intense! It has been out for a while but it was still worth the $3-4 dollars.
034580404X|5.0|This is a trilogy that will stay with me a very long time. I read this trilogy three months ago and still have images from words that were written in ads today about \\"vanilla diamonds\\" thinking oh really someone must have read these books.  I am glad there were scenes I skimmed through but the story line WILL stay with me if ever re-read.  This is not an easy read but your husband will probably thank you (or silently the writer for writing these books) for reading these book.  They give a thought process that most of us would not normally have and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I would recommend.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|What can I say about this show, if you haven't seen it you should. It's about so much more than just killing zombies, although that's a cool part of it. It's about man's struggle with not only himself, but also his surroundings and his fellow man. What would we do 'post zombie takeover'? What would you be willing to do to survive? Who do you trust and could you kill if you had to? It feeds into society's fear, not just of death but also of survival 'out of your box'. Great show, love it!

B00AKKS278|4.0|This Author, 'Yo Pal' Hal Elrod, really has a profound impact on soooo many people. One of the beautiful things about this book is it helps you to see those things that are 'hidden in plain sight.' If you've been wanting to improve your life but just didn't know where to start, this is it! This book is a MUST READ and I would have rated it at 5 stars, but left it at 4 as the 5th star only comes from YOU implementing what you read.<br /><br />I'll give a little background as to how I found this book. I have heard Hal Elrod speak at conferences put on by a company I used to work for and a few of my close friends have had tremendous success with hiring Mr Elrod as a personal coach. He began developing and sharing the Miracle Morning with his coaching clients years before actually taking the time needed to complete this book, so I've known about his Miracle Morning program for quite some time, but had never delved into it myself. I have been receiving emails from Hal's mailing list for, well... I don't even know how long, but rarely opened them as we often sign up for a list for one reason or another and then get busy with other things. As I lay on my bed one night in late November/early December I was trying to figure out what I needed to do to steer my life back to where I want it to be, I needed to make a change. It was while I was laying there in thought my phone beeped telling me that I had received a new email. I saw that it was from Hal's mailing list and recalling how his concepts had helped friends I decided to see what he had to say. It was an invitation to listen in on a free tele-seminar about how to have your best year ever. I decided to register for the call as I figured hey, it can't hurt. I was already thinking about what I could do to improve things, so why not?<br /><br />Hal was offering 2 free chapters of The Miracle Morning when you registered for the call, so I went ahead and downloaded it. I read those 2 chapters and knew that this was a book I needed to read. Since receiving The Miracle Morning Book and Journal I have found it easier to articulate my purpose each day and an added reason to get up each morning. I even noticed, just this morning, that my pants (which have been getting increasingly tighter) actually fit a bit more loosely! Most people already know what they need to do to be happier, healthier, etc... they just lack the motivation and accountability to do them. The Miracle Morning book has given me the motivation and the amazing people I have met through the Miracle Morning Community on Facebook and given me the accountability structure.<br /><br />All I can really say is 'Thanks, Hal'.eded to read.

B009MF5BXK|4.0|The Expendables 2 is just what you would expect from a sequel to the action-packed prequel that Sylvester Stallone brought to the screen in 2010.<br /><br />Like most sequels, this second installment doesn't seem to have quite the originality of the first picture, but it certainly wasn't for a lack of effort, expense or casting. The addition of Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris, as well as the greatly expanded roles of Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwartzenegger, more than make-up for the lack of Mickey Rourke and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The action scenes and special effects are just as over-the-top (in a good way) as they were in the first picture. If you are looking for non-stop action and some cheesy dialogue from some of the 20th century's biggest and best action stars, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Those of you looking for a coherent plot, articulate dialogue or not being subjected to actors for whom English is a second (or third) language will obviously want to skip watching this movie. This flick is just pure fun for grownups who never quite outgrew their favorite action stars.<br /><br />The only real criticism of the movie worth mentioning (for those of you who can appreciate the true potential the movie had with such an all-star line-up) is the fact that there are a lot of missed opportunities for on-screen showdowns we all would have loved to have seen. Like a martial arts battle between Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris, or Jet Li, for that matter. Whether it was due to bad scripting, inflated egos, Hollywood politics or just because these guys were too old to pull-off such demanding scenes, we'll probably never know. The most recent flicks I have seen from Jean-Claude Van Damme and Jet Li would seem to suggest that at least those two could have done some great work together. We'll never know though, unfortunately. Stallone seems to take the brunt of the punishment and stunts in this movie, despite the fact that he looks much older than he did in the original film and isn't quite as central to the plot. As long as you don't go in expecting to see all of the characters mixing it up against one another, you likely won't be disappointed though.did in the original film and isn't quite as central to the plot.

0307341577|1.0|This book is the verbal equivalent of watching someone cough up a loogie and spit it in your face. I've never read a book that showed so much contempt for its readers. Every character in it is so exaggeratedly repellent they are almost absurd. If you even come close to finding a character sympathetic or even excusable you can almost envision Flynn at her keyboard thinking hard about how to throw in some gratuitous grossness to keep the characters disgusting. THEN she offends every mystery lover in existence by expecting us to accept the idea that two murderers were murdering people in two separate acts in the same place at the same time. That's lazy and it's cheating.<br /><br />I've read some other reviews that say this book is well-written. Flynn can string one word after the other in a competent fashion but to say this book is well-written is like saying Jack the Ripper made pretty red designs on the pavement.

B008M87GJK|5.0|Maybe the best news app at the moment.  I don't always have the time to watch the BBC News...especially with their fascination with business instead of actual news these days.  This app lets me filter out the s*** (like the royals) and get to the good stuff (like the actual news)!  Configure it how you like...a great Kindle Fire HD app!!!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Campy, gory, over the top, well-acted! The first season was better, but I will watch this show even if it jumps 5 sharks!
B004SOR4H6|2.0|It's Twitter...what did you expect?  The thing that boring people think make them interesting.  This thing is only for people who have to tell everyone what they are doing RIGHT NOW  ...  ALL THE TIME.  News organizations all over the world love this (app/lifestyle) because they no longer have to work (or think) to publish their stories.
B005PK553C|5.0|This season was incredible! You MUST watch it!!!! Campy, gory, weird, creepy, Ryan Murphy without all the studio execs breathing down his neck as hard!
B005IQ39AY|2.0|Maybe it's just me, but I really dislike games that make me go back and start over at level one if I fail a level.  I want to keep trying the failed level until I succeed.
0395389496|5.0|Great story to be read over and over again! The illustrations are beautiful, it is a timeless masterpiece. It is ahard cover treasure for all the family.Any family with kids or grandkids should keep a copy to enjoy every year.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is the greatist game ever. I have just got into my little pony button this game is amaiins. (I spelled that wrong) !!!!! just to lit you know whach the first season woves
B003R0MF5I|5.0|I wish this show had lasted longer than five seasons.  This was a good show with a fun story line.
B009FOBMBI|4.0|It's a good album that is well written, edited, and composed. Though the albums appears to lag behind in a song or two.
