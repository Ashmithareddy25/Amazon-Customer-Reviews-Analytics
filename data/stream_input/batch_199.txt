B0035RE2TA|3|My husband and I both really liked this body brush, while it lasted. We used this brush as part of our sauna routine (one sauna a week) for about 8 months until the bristles wore out. The bristles were not too hard nor too soft for scrubbing off dead skin. The strap was great for making sure you didn't drop the brush when it was soapy. For the price I don't think it was a bad deal but I'm going to try a different product in the hopes that it will last longer.
B005I55W3W|5|Excellent product
B001A3ATP2|5|gotta have emm
B000P275I8|5|My favorite perfume!  I receive buckets of compliments on its fresh, sweet scent.
B009K2BC2Y|1|I bought this thinking maybe I'd give it a try and I was super excited to receive them. this came a month and 4 days later..<br />I tried using them and they are horrible. they are just like glitter pens and when you apply them to you nails, they last a few minutes. total waist of money. I BEG YOU DO NOT BUY THESE
B00D18ZDM8|5|does a great job
B0000CC64W|5|Have always heard good things about olay and had the night cream and eye serum that i would use now and then.  I decided that at 35 it was time to pay more attention to preserving my skin and decided to go with olay.  This serum was great for my skin, i used it day and night putting a sunscreen over it in the days.  My face was the best it has looked in years....i saw noticeable reduction in the size of pores and the cream was perfect as a moisturizer for me and not over oily (i had been searching for a good moisturizer for a while)....pretty much my only complaint is that it finished way to soon....i am off to buy me another bottle now!
B007P1T7H4|5|Works well
B005SPHH4E|5|I love this toner.  My skin is aging and this toner does not strip moisture, it puts moisture back in.  It makes my skin feel very soft and no breakouts from it.
B00H3OKXUS|4|Perhaps the best feature of this product is the fact that, unlike the vast majority of skin care products sold in the USA, this product does not contain any toxic ingredients.  It is also made in the USA and not tested on animals.<br /><br />As for the product's smell (due to carrots being an ingredient), it is not terribly bothersome and after a few minutes, the smell dissipates completely.<br /><br />The only potential downside is that the product does not contain a sunscreen.  I do not consider this a negative, however.
B00I6E9ADA|5|Ordered because I can't find in stores.  I love this lipstick.  It's beautiful and think Covergirl shld continue making it
B00I2MH2V8|2|I tried this on my face and it actually made more of a mess than I hoped for. I followed the instructions and when I went to pull it off, it didn't come off as a strip but in pieces. I ended up running warm water over the wax to soften it up to clean it off my face. Might be good for legs but not for the face.
B003CP12QG|4|I love this toothbrush.  I mean, in as much as one can love a toothbrush, this is the one I love.  I've been using them now for many years.  I like the size in my hand, I like the medium bristles, I like the amount of vibration, I like how clean my teeth feel after using this brush.  My only quibble, and the reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that on some of them the battery has a very short life.  I wonder whether these have been sitting on shelves longer, but it almost doesn't matter....  the battery should outlast the bristles for this to be a perfect 5 star item.  Instead, there are times when I still have good strong bristles left but the battery is dead.  I know I can change the battery myself (there are youtube videos dedicated to how to accomplish this), but really I don't think I should have to and nor do I want to.<br /><br />I have tried the soft bristle version and its just a bit too soft and wimpy for for.  This brush with the medium bristles seems to give a good cleaning.  Some have complained that the bristles are too hard.  For my gums their not, but if you have very sensitive teeth and gums you might find otherwise.
B0009OAHO6|5|I love this fragrance it has a wonderful scent and it stays with you all day long and i will have to get more soon.
B009SE6OV8|5|Easy to use, really wonderful product.  Haven't ever had a problem and I've been using them for over 5 years.
B008LF602I|5|This eye shadow pencil can be used as eyeshadow or eyelinger! Best thing ever
B00GHK20PK|5|I was surprised at the thickness of the product, as I am accustomed to very liquidy competitors.  It is pleasant on the skin and has a very rapid brightening effect.  The vitamin C is actually L-ascorbic acid (the effective kind)  according to your site, and that is what compelled me to order &#34;Oui&#34;.
B000C214B0|5|This cologne is perfect for day or night. It's sexy, not overpowering, and warm. My man smells amazing when wearing it.
B0006ZHJM6|3|This product is okay. I know tons of people that use it and have only positive things to say about the product. I am a black woman, no chemical treatments in my hair, and my hair is naturally curly. I would say my hair type is 3a and all this product does is make my hair curl even more once the product mixes with the natural oils in my hair. You wouldn't want to to apply too much because it will leave a big chunk of white residue. Now , what I think would work best is if you put it on dryer hair, for example, freshly blown out hair. However, I keep my hair very moisturized ( not greasy at all, but I do enjoy my pre-pos and steam treatments) and I don't think that works with this product; too much slip. Those are my thoughts on this.
B0050VAIBK|4|this is nice, it's inexpensive and I'd describe the bristles as medium. they're not all soft and smooshy like a doll hair brush but they're not going to scrub your skin off. colors are bright, I think the handle is plenty long.
B004883YU8|5|GREAT mascara
B000FGDIRQ|5|Have used this product for a long time!  Love it!  Fresh and minty!
B008OTS164|1|It was not what I wanted. I ordered the aerosol spray but you sent the non aerodol
B000ULRD1S|1|my opinión is about Geo Marketing, I want to return product because Courier can t send it, but they don t want, I don t understand the reason because the returning is within days they let you return products. Please try to solve this problema, you must be available to accept returns
B00DZKFFZ2|5|These bath salts are AWESOME! They smell fabulous, they leave your skin feeling silky soft, and they are all ORGANIC! What's not to love?! My favorite thing about these bath salts is that after a nice long soak, I get out of the bath feeling relaxed and rejuvenated. These are going to be stocking stuffers for family this year- I know they will love them just as much as I do!
B000FBF5BI|4|I have been using this mascara since I was 18 (now 23). When I find myself low on cash I'll go back to whatever new drug store mascara I feel like trying and EVERY time I find myself angry that I wasted my money and go right back to this one. The tube tends to last me about 4- 6 months, great coverage (never needing touch ups during the day), doesn't goop or clump lashes together. I'm from a family of three girls and we all use this one. But if you don't buy the waterproof be warned it smears!
B0077LAJT2|4|Still on the first blade. Trying to see how long they last compared to the very expensive multiple bladed. Close shave, using a Merkur. Think the box will last until I'm.....
B004VSLG1Y|4|This brush head works well and it does deep clean my face an pores.  It may be a bit to harsh for those of you with really sensitive skin.  My skin is oily and does not naturally exfoliate at a rate I would like so cleaning my face with this brush head is ideal.  My skin is smoother.  But as I said, if your skin is sensitive or your skin is thin, you may want to use a regular brush head.
B0071XPQQ2|5|Its really good for dry skin.
B00J60VP22|4|Not bad i like it!!
B0055BZ37O|5|Really works and keeps teeth clean and gums healthy. Have used it for many many years.  Never had such healthy gums
B0093P3AUU|3|I bought this at Costco and since I'm on the fairer side, I was reassured since the model they used is fair skinned. However, it was two shades too dark for me. It's feels great and aside from the shade, makes my skin feel and look lovely. Far from &#34;universal&#34; though.
B00N001PJW|5|if the babes aren't all over you after using this product.....you probably did pay to much for it........
B00B1W1BK4|5|Been using this product for years.  It's the best.  Since it's discontinued I order on Amazon. The 2oz size is perfect for travel.
B00O3CH3VU|5|I have only used it once so far but I loved the way my hair turned out after using this shampoo!  It smells nice and it was nice to know there weren't all the chemicals to weigh my curls down.
B004TSFBNK|5|This brushes are excellent.  The buffing brush is amazing for liquid and power foundation.  This kit is amazing, it beats some of my more expensive brushes.  Definitely a must.
B0050GRAV6|5|Awesome !!! Just try and you will see how works on your skin
B00H1NWX8Q|5|I am happy to say that this product actually works perfect for my hair. I get compliment and my hair stays flat all the time. I can also curl my hair with this flat iron. I definitely recommend this product even though it is a little pricey but worth it!
B003TQE4UE|2|I usually love these color palette eyeshadows but I'm not real crazy about the browns in this one.  The dark brown is the color of powdered cocoa.  It does come with \\"well rested\\" eye product that I was very happy with.
B004YVDIAU|5|Garnier Fructis Style Curl Sculpting Gel works great on my baby, fine hair. I live in Florida where the humidity is constant. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is searching for a great product for your hair.
B00N9D8PES|5|This face cream feels light and non greasy.  My skin feels softer and more subtle  after only a few uses!  Smells good, too.  Natural ingredients.
B002PR2GLM|5|Great Product
B0000CC64W|5|Great product
B001707IQ6|5|Helps my makeup last throughout the day. Everything stays in place. I prefer the matte finish rather than a dewy finish and I get it with this product.
B00481I1VW|5|Very useful piece of equipment, especially if you are on your own. I have looked everywhere for an applicator to put moisturiser on my back and this is excellent.
B001BKN0RI|5|Exelent
B000S81ZNK|5|A friend gave me this product while I was going through chemo. Usually I did not have a problem with nausea or vomiting, but I did have some times where nausea was over whelming.  These calmed me right down.<br /><br />Both the smell of the pastilles and the taste were mild and calming.<br /><br />The side effect I still have from my chemo days is a bit of IBS. My main problem is gas and this helps that.  It could be I start drinking water too, but if something helps that pain, I am all for it.<br /><br />Nice too to settle a rumbly tummy before a meal.
B001W9YDY2|4|After trying several other products in this category i find that Matt Paste holds up better than anything else.  I have used this product over the past year with my hair length going from about 2&#34; on top to over 6&#34; and it does what i need all along the way.  I have long, thick, and wavy hair now and its the best thing i have found thus far in my quest for the perfect hair product.
B0075W9F7U|4|When they say \\"mini\\", they really mean MINI! It is only about 1\\" wide by 2\\" long, takes forever to crimp a whole head of hair, but it would work nicely for chunky crimping or traveling.
B0017QK70Y|5|Excellent product, really works on humans and dogs. Our dog has taken it, with the vets approval, to reduce pain from luxating knee caps. The only draw back is that it's hard to get at a reasonable price consistently.
B00171ARH2|5|Received timely and exactly as advertised. Used last night and works well. This appears to be a new formula, but results were the same. I have used both the pure black and the blue/black, not much difference. Please be careful with this, it really does sting if you get this in your eyes.
B00EZCQ0AS|1|Won't work in the tool that I bought them for, or for my mom's curler :(
B001KYQ7R0|4|Orchid Frost is hard to find in stores. This is the BEST lipstick. It is a wonderful pink shade with specks of glitter in it; smells nice and very moisturizing. This is not the best price, otherwise it would have been 5 starts. I am still searching for this product locally. Love it!
B003TXZSU2|5|A great product combo. I have naturally straight hair but aggressive monthly coloring causes damage that makes it frizz out in weird ways. These products keep my hair very smooth.<br /><br />Like other good keratin treatments, it is harder to get volume or brush-curl when blow-drying, so hair is a little flat, but it's worth it to get longer-lasting color and frizz control.
B00TJ1Y476|5|Love it...  defiantly will buy again
B00B6U1JYO|5|Best shampoo ever for a dry, scaly, flaky scalp! Tried so many things on my daughter's scalp, but nothing ever worked. With just one use, my daughter's scalp is 90% better! Might not work for everyone but definitely worth a try...especially for the price!
B005JDPLMA|2|A little too thick for my taste, it is very tacky, so it doesn't work well in my thick hair.
B0020ZEA40|1|I received my BB cream right before I was headed out for vacation. While I was there, I realized that I could easily scratch off the lettering on the front, and that it wasn't the REAL Skin79 product.<br />The only reason I give it a 1 star rating, is because whatever product this was laid really nicely on my skin. Good skin cover up, but made me break out like crazy!
B00644YNAO|3|The brushes look good but upon opening the envelope, I found that one of the brushes was bent. Giving it three stars, may re-rate after usage.
B003WR3QSG|4|Just started using it so will follow up with another review. Nice handle, good brush. Feels good on my face and produces a nice lather.
B001T0HHCY|5|I can't say that I'm too enthusiastic about doing my hair, but this product makes it really easy. It's quick for me because I have longer hair and it takes me no more than 15min. to do my hair.  If you are looking for something that leaves your hair really curly then this would not be the right size unless you have super long hair.  But this is a great solution for somebody who is lazy like me and just wants her hair to do something. It heats up extremely fast, so be careful. I have hair that is too healthy so need a lot of heat for it to hold a curl. Doesn't seem like it damages my hair too much either like other curling irons.
B0085MKRIA|3|I just got my package today and boy can I tell u the top corner was oily! The castor oil was leaking through the package!! Although it was only a little bit, I'm upset about it. I just applied the product to my lashes so we'll see how it goes
B000IEAYKO|5|Works great, not sticky at all, no shine, I use just a small amount and hold last all day.<br />Love it.
B007Y6S0JQ|5|I've loved this makeup for years, and so sad to see it's no longer sold in stores.  I've tried all types, including the most expensive and they don't come close.  It never turns orange on your skin or looks cakey.  Great for oily skin, also covers small  imperfections, evening out skin tones.
B0050QLDGY|5|This hair dryer works great and it is cool seeing the fans through the clear plastic but it is bigger and heavier than other hair dryers I have used; it's not outrageously bulky but it different. The attachments are nice and the power cord is sufficiently long that you aren't bound to your outlet. Overall a very good, almost professional quality, hair dryer.
B004YBW5T0|5|great shea butter
B0002KHU3I|5|The best type of head.
B009FJGP0Q|5|very happy...no problems...thank you...
B001LTP9YG|1|This product was suppose to be new. It was not a full bottle and if I would have known this I would have never ordered it. I don't feel as though I got my moneys worth.
B004GEXU5S|5|My complexion is better after 1 month. Be sure to fallow as directed per instructions. I still get some pimples but much less.
B00GGXFJ7O|5|great little brush for the price
B004ETIZ3M|5|I have been using the Ion One Stroke for about a year now, and I absolutely LOVE it. I had originally been looking for an iron that would actually keep my hair (which is just a bit naturally wavy, not super curly or anything) straight all day, not just for a few hours in the morning and then poofy by afternoon. I also was hoping to find something that could possibly tame my hair in the humidity. I went to a beauty supply shop in town, and they recommended the One Stroke to take care of all of this. I have never spent $80 on anything like this before, and to be honest the idea did not sit well with me, but I was to the point where I was willing to give it a try. It is probably one of the best investments I ever made. I am SO happy I spent the money on it, and when this one decides to die on me, I won't think twice about spending the money on another one. The iron heats up extremely fast, and the time that I usually spent straightening it has been cut in half. I have never seen my hair so pin-straight before (not to mention this soft), and the look lasts the entire day and sometimes into the next. Although it may begin to curl a bit in the humidity, it is nothing compared to what it used to be. I could go on and on about how much I love this iron, but I think you get the idea.
B00AZR5IGE|4|This wax is pretty Dank. It smells good, but as soon as you reheat it to make the wax all super awesome and usable again the smell dies. Also I wish this was was stronger. This doesn't hold up well in humidity so thats why I top it with Culbmans wax. I use this for shaping it because this handles better then clubmans. Just wish it was stronger hold.
B005IT1K3Y|5|Very light and amazing on my skin
B00023EP3I|5|Very nice scent and moisturizes nicely.
B002KAA8KK|5|Worked almost immediately !
B007905GI0|5|this is a gentle non foaming face soap. it almost can remove waterproof mascara. almost.<br />i love the whole line.
B008QWW9GM|5|Love them
B003WR3QSG|4|I dumped the multiblade shavers to return to wet safety razor shaving. I only have my fathers shaving brush to compare it to, but i seems fuller. It is a joy to lather up with. I am well pleased.
B003P85MAM|5|Soap nut products are great. This shampoo leaves your hair feeling clean and doesnt strip your hair of nutrients. I don't have oily hair but use to always wash my hair daily to keep it looking radiant. You can go a few days in between washing your hair with this stuff. I also recommend soap nut dish soap and laundry soap. Fragrance free, no allergens and toxic chemicals.
B00HUUS0X2|4|This product works very well for its very specific purpose: apply lotion to hard to reach areas of your back without wasting the lotion. I can use sunscreen or my favorite moisturizer and reach between my shoulder blades and other upper back areas, and due to the non-absorbent fabric of this product, all of the lotion ends up on me, not on the applicator. The elastic bands are sturdy enough to work properly to pull the fabric across my back. If I wanted to grab the fabric ends themselves instead of the elastic bands, I could. I also like this product because with limited joint flexibility and one shoulder already repaired, I don't have to strain/fail to reach areas when I can't ask my husband to do it for me. I took off one star only because this should be a $10 product, not a $20 product.
B00H93NJLS|4|It doesn't help moisturize my hair as much as I thought it would. It's great for your skin. I have a t-zone prone oily type of skin and this doesn't make it over oily.
B00L4FQVB2|5|So far I really like this shampoo!  For being sulfate free, you still get a nice lather and my hair feels very clean.  I paired it with the Silk 18 conditioner and my hair was so soft and shiny.  This is great for a natural shampoo!
B000FZDPWU|5|This is a great base coat. I have tried them all. What I like best about this one is that if you use two coats and a shiny top coat it is a very pretty pale white color on its own.
B0012XM8X6|3|I thought that the glycolic acid would gradually &#34;peel&#34; the skin on the areas of my face that I had applied it to.  It hasn't so far, and the dark spots that are on my cheek, have not faded.
B000E7UDJ2|5|My son lovet
B000GLRREU|5|Awesome price and fast delivery!
B006UMU4NK|4|Their sharp they cut good
B003NF1BCA|5|bought this for a friends 40th birthday as a gag gift after she opened it and we had are laugh LOL. we all were  reading the cards this game looks like a lot of fun to play. think I will have to buy this for my wife and I well worth the money shipped on time and rec early.
B00CJ01QT8|5|Got it as a gift to my mom, she loves it! Thank you! :)
B008RG9MKS|3|I know, I know. It's a hair dryer. I don't have a problem with the loudness of the noise, it was the pitch when I was using the high heat setting. The pitch caused ringing in my ears. For comparison, I plugged in my full size Bayliss Ceramix Xtreme hairdryer and turned it on high. The full size on high was the same level of loudness as the low on the Vidal Sassoon unit.<br /><br />As for the heat of the air coming out of the unit, the low was warm, while the high was very hot and effective in drying very wet hair. The unit itself felt pretty good in the hand and felt sturdy and not at all cheap. The folding handle is a nice feature.<br /><br />Overall, I think this would have been a keeper had it not caused ringing in my ears.
B00ESYFTVO|4|Despite the ridiculously long delivery time, cant really complain because shipping was free. The product works GREAT! Was going to order some from Younique, but decided to try this first and I love it. MUCH better price. I never have to wear false lashes again. I have very thin eyelashes due to them coming off from the false lashes, so this is great. Got my first set a few days ago and will be ordering again within the next few days to allow shipping so that I will not be without. A MUST buy.
B004QWVY8A|5|Best Do It Yourself Hair Clipper.  This is my 3rd Norelco Hair Clipper.  Each generation of do-it-yourself hair clippers keeps getting better.  They made every upgrade that I would make to the previous generation.
B00IT1ECBA|5|Leaves your hands feeling very clean without any residue at all, smells good too.
B004OHQR1Q|4|These dotting tools are great.  Different sizes.  Although one has a slight imperfection at the base of the handle they are still in great condition, bright colors and I will be ordering more to add to my collection.
B007BDEZBY|5|gave for a gift and she was thrilled.  too strong for me and my asthma but i already knew that but my beautician loves it so i got it for her.  she feels the same way not clean without talcum powder which is what we grew up using.  they sure took a loooog time to decide it was not good for you.
B004G7J0HM|1|I was trying to move away from burts bees (i use the classic one) since they lacked in quality nowadays. Tried this lip balm and it tastes ok but i dont see any lasting effect. I prefer to apply only once a day. After applying in the morning, my lips were dry after only a few hours. Might be i got a faulty product, but I am surprised at such high reviews for this product. The moisturizer doesnt work.
B00CHKKWZO|5|Nice hairpiece, versatile, natural looking.
B000VHH712|5|I love the lather and thorough cleansing this has on my hair.  Does not strip my color at all and softens my coarse strands.  The smell is nice and it rinses out clean.  One of the few shampoos that is definitely worth every penny and does what it says it does.  A must-have shampoo that I need to keep in stock in my shower at all times!
B000UWAWQU|5|Very please with item!!
B00830D9XO|5|This product came as described by amazon with no packaging problems and no product problems. Thank you.
B00AIZL0VU|5|Good stuff and got it pronto!
B001QDMT54|5|Nice product for curly hair.
B00ARF42H0|4|This works good and holds a charge for many days
B000C1Z6CE|5|This has been my very best perfume. Thank you. It arrived perfectly
B00JA19Y9I|4|CAME JUST HOW THEY SHOW IT .
B000NHTB7I|5|Been using this product for years...highly recommend!
B000S858TW|5|great price
B00GHK20PK|4|very happy with this product. i been using it for a few months. works just as fab as the skinceutical brand.
B004ZNGWRI|5|I have used GM Collin products for a few years now and this sun screen is awesome. It's just like their moisturizer. I will continue to use this products.
B000L596FE|5|I have very long and rather thick hair but it's oily so over conditioning to deal with tangles just makes my hair look dirty. I've had the same issues with detangling spray and pretty much everything else I've tried. I also don't like a lot of product in my hair so this brush has been ideal. I use it in the shower to comb through conditioner and I use it after my shower to brush out the tangles. Works great and I would recommend it to anyone who has issues with tangled hair.
B000HGJLM0|5|These have yet to get any tears or snags in them in the last month or so I've had them. Also like the color!
B0031SXMHQ|5|Such a great fragrance!
B006ZR92SS|4|I really like these but people with sensitive skin may not like it. Plan on keeping it in some type of air tight container after opening. It does seal well after opening. It will dry out if you don't store it in an air tight container. I'm just using a ziplock baggy.
B005BEF5EQ|5|Fantastic stuff.  Helps protect hair from any damage from blow drying or flat or curling iron.  Smells wonderful.
B002DVHTFI|4|This makes my hair pretty soft and shiny. I spray it in my hair when my hair is damp. That's when it works the best.
B004K50BEG|5|I like this product very much - did not cause any irritation or redness and instructions for use were very helpful.  First time I have used this product and very happy I bought it.
B001LXMI3M|5|I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT I RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT, IT WAS WELL WORTH THE ORDER AND THE CONDITION WAS EVERY THING I EXPECTED
B0061HB7L2|5|I really liked it, i used it for my human vriska for homestuck and it was very soft, you couldnt see my wig cap or neck through it and it was easy to brush. very worth it and i'm glad i bought it.
B00UJ0P4PM|5|These brushes are great.  The only way they could have been better would be if they were marked, e.g. eye shadow, eyeliner, etc.  I have gone thru many brushes before looking for the right brushes that will do the job they are supposed to do, and these are it!!!!!!!!! I love the way they apply my eye shadow, the different sizes to get the look you want from inside to outside of eye.  I would recommend these to anyone.  Get them you'll love them.
B000K88306|2|Byers, make sure you are getting the same haircolor and the same box as shows on the picture. There is a changed formula in the newest boxes with the same number, which has a different quality of color . My wife ended up with dimmed golden damaged hair instead light ash blond as used to be . Do not make the same mistake as she did, already twice.
B00JNHAW90|5|Love it!
B000RJN4FW|5|Best for eye floaters
B00120VWJ0|5|Some of my favorite soap, you just feel cleaner when you're smelling it's wonderful peppermint fragrance and tingling a little bit.
B00HM6IXH2|5|I have very thin hair and it looks dry and damaged. This shampoo instantly gave my hair a noticeable amount of volume and also makes it so much healthier. My hair feels light and clean! The shampoo is more like a gel so I only use a tiny bit and it lathers well. The smell isn't so great but it does what it says it does!!
B000V10N7I|5|I started using this product several yrs ago and then off and on I forget to buy more.  I live by this as it works so well.  It smells great and your face will feel so good after the first use.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to have a fresh look.
B0098QPV3I|5|I have been using Moroccan oil products for a long time. It is gentle on my highlighted hair and leaves a shine that enhances the color. Very good product.
B007ROCZVY|5|I'm very excited about my new nylon cape.  The numerous snap closures make it a perfect fit for my 2 yr old all the way up to my  16 yr old.  Now my poor family won't be itching and scratching all through their haircuts.  Yippee!!  And the hair just glides right off.  Great product for a great price.  Love it!
B0000YUYYS|5|Miracle product! My son has been a thumb sucker since his first sonogram lol but not anymore thanks to this product!
B008R7CQ46|4|Pleasant taste and smooth texture, Not too overpowering at all and does wonders for any plaque you may have, I have noticed a slight aftertaste even 10 minutes after rinsing.
B000WY6KLM|1|Product was old
B00PUMYJI2|5|Absolutely LOVE this little darling!  I will never use the manual foot files again.  Wish I had found it sooner!
B0043W2C48|5|This dryer is so convenient. I work at my desktop doing drying time. Worth the investment.  Other reviewers say that it dries hair quickly and it does.
B001JQLNMS|5|I love this!  I can see a difference in the lines around my eyes.
B0077PLNNE|4|Clearly a superior product. I have been an Epilady customer for seven years and have gone through MANY products.  The latex only lasted eight months.  While I have only had the Braun for two months, it has out performed the Epilady by far.  It provides a much closer epilation, leaving the skin smooth rather than a bit stubbly.  The charge lasts longer and I love the safety &#34;on&#34; feature.  I can't sing the praises of the product enough.  All areas in which I use it is great.  And I use it everywhere possible.
B0047F9622|4|It's a great set for the price especially as a Xmas gift<br />Overall it's a good product but have to be consistent with the usage
B0038NHYA0|5|Love the product.....loyal customer :)
B001CYRV64|5|if you haven't tried it, it works great- to use when you are using a hot iron
B000NL0T1G|5|Good product - easy to use.  Very cheap for the quality.  Saves like $3.5 (not much but makes a difference) per week.  Just be slow when shaving or you'll cut yourself since it's got 1 blade (2 sides though).
B0043OSIVM|4|For the price, it is definitely worth it! It is less than half the price and the bottle is MUCH bigger. When using it, you should always wash your scalp under the shower head. It's important to rinse well when using any dandruff shampoo. This shampoo smell very clean. I love it.
B00EP83X6Q|5|I didn't know it was still in production. My favorite scent
B000YZ4MSC|5|I've tried many types of hairspray, but this one is hands down the best out there. It is a little pricey, but worth it! I have fine-thin hair.
B0006OU078|2|the brush itself it great. but the picture and description was for a black brush.....i received a hot pink brush. really
B010FOJA56|5|I am sooo glad I got this thing. I recently got a haircut that is, well... less than perfection. As I am growing it out and evening out the chops, I need a styling tool to make it look like a professional creation. I am pretty good with my hair, but it's really tiring switching from straight iron to curling iron. This flat iron and curing iron in one heats fast and works as well as far more expensive irons that I've owned. I love the curl it creates and the ease of operation. It also smooths out your hair like satin! What more can I say? This is so well put together -- you'll know as soon as you pick it up that this is a quality device that seems to promise excellent durability. Sample provided and I am very happy with the Kiloline 2-in-1 curler and iron!
B0006V5M74|5|I've been a licensed cosmetologist for thirty years, and have been using this product for almost as long. Nothing else compares, superior to pumice. No it is not a genuine stone and will dissolve over time. It is long lasting (months) and effective. Used regularly at the end of the bath (once skin has been thoroughly softened), dry, cracked or splitting soles and heels are a thing of the past. There is no better product out there. I highly recommend this product to my friends, family and clients. 5 Stars all the way!
B00BJHY99G|5|This was a present and the person already had a 1 Million I thought I was getting the same one but he was very happy with the 1 Million Intense both are a must. Fantastic fragrance
B004C4RCS8|1|I used the # 30 dark brown color on my dark brown hair. It turned my hair almost black and I liked the look of it but my hair felt very brittle after the first coloring. The color faded quite fast and the gray coverage wasn't great. I did a second coloring 7weeks later and started noticing abnormal hair loss. My hair feels like straw and they are now super thin. I am not sure if this hair loss is a direct consequence of me dying my hair but I am sure it doesn't help...<br /><br />I won't be using it again
B004DIXYWG|5|Just received  the primer first day of use and this is a miracle in a bottle small bottle but it is worth the money
B00336EUTK|1|Causes canker sores after every use. Whiteness goes away in a day.
B005IHAHXA|4|Bought this as a spare case to hold my invisalign braces and it does what it is supposed to do.  Snaps shut without issues and isn't hard to open either.  Bought another for my mom.
B004PANDIC|5|very impressed!!! I wear my hair naturally curly, I used this flatiron and it really straightened my hair looks like I have a perm! loved it..I try not to apply alot of heat to my hair, so I will use on very occasions, saves money going to a salon
B000ZPSNW2|1|This product does not stand up to it apposing duties It does not do what it is suppose to do
B00H3R30BO|5|A great body wash for shower use that leaves a wonderful coating.  Does a good job of turning dry skin into a smooth feeling.
B006GZA2RE|1|Piece of crap<br /><br />Dont buy it ,
B000OO63Y4|5|this hair dye is great
B004R0INWG|4|If you have a stubborn acne that just won't go away- use this.  A little drying; so be careful not to use too much
B0016836RY|5|I've been holding off on writing this review because I was positive my face would adjust to the Acne.org Regmin and would go back to the way it was, if not worse, when I started using these products.<br /><br />There aren't enough good things I can say about Acne.org.  For the last 18 years of my life, I'm currently 28, I've had awful pale skin: extremely prone to redness (to the point where people think I have a rash if I just quickly scratch an itch), very oily skin all over my face except around my eyes which are always dry, and horribly prone to break outs which most heavily affected around my mouth,jaw and forehead.  \\"Time of the month\\" didn't matter, I was always broken out, though I'm sure hormones and stress were some of the biggest factors.  I've seen dermatologists (biggest waste of money), tried over the counter remedy soaps (unscented, antibacterial, sensitive, etc- nothing), Proactiv (everything got 2x worse), Clarsonic and light treatment.  Those last two showed the best improvement, but my skin only got about 20% better.<br /><br />Because everything I tried in the past, I thought Acne.org would just be more of the same.  The reason I decided to give it a go was their website.  They had a lot of information/explanations I'd never seen before and structure around their program.  They also talk about  alternative drugstore options which I'd never seen before.  This was the best decision I ever made.  My face as actually been clear about 5 months now with only 1 pimple I can actually recall.  For me that's completely unheard of.  Every time my mom sees me says she can't believe how good my face looks and she was always the first to point out how bad my skin looked, which only made me a lot more insecure.  (What happened to your face? Doesn't that hurt?).  To hear my mom now tell me how good it looks whenever she sees me is AMAZING.<br /><br />There are a few things that are critical to keep in mind with these products which all go back to things they mention on their website: follow their steps and suggestions!  1- Be really gentle with your skin while using this stuff.  For me this was particularly important at the beginning month to month and a half, which is the hardest part of starting this product.  Like just about all other acne treatments you have to give it a month or two because your skin is purging.  Which leads to 2: your skin will get worse before it gets better and I've yet to come across anyone say differently. I personally had a huge problem with flaking and dryness (which looks even worse when you put make up on top of it).  I contribute some of I felt was excessive dryness to the fact that I was taking Pantothenic Acid capsules which are also good for acne.  To help with the dryness and even out my skin tone I started using Acne.org AHA Lotion.  And that brings me to my final point; 3- start off SLOW with SMALL amounts of Treament and AHA (if you decide to use it) because it is easy to use too much and feel like your face is going to burn off.  you need to work up to the larger amounts.  You can always add a little more to your face if you didn't get enough out of the tube/bottle at first, but once you put too much of this stuff on it feels near impossible to cool off your face even after trying to wash it off.<br /><br />Now that I'm several months into using the products, I feel like I can be a little more flexible in my routine.  The only thing I'm really thinking about changing is to maybe find a thicker moisturizer for winter.  But I do like that their moisturize has a yellow tinge since it helps neutralize redness.<br /><br />Like my title says: my miracle product.  I refuse to stop using this for a long time and I tell everyone I can about this stuff.  Bravo Acne.org.
B00G6JZUMM|5|love the color
B00MWH8C40|5|Great
B0001XQNNE|1|Smells terrible.  I started to have allergic reaction to it.  I had difficulty breathing.  I could never use this every day on my hair.  And if I smelled it on myself then you know other people thought I stunk.
B008PEXV3Q|5|My daughter loved these! She enjoyed adding them to her nail art to add a personal style and touch! wow
B00GXY8OT6|5|I really like the hair tie its well made the quality is pretty good. Its not much to say for $1.30
B002HWS9GG|5|Great toothbrush.My teeth feel nice and clean.
B002XQ1XD2|5|Awesome smell
B004LY4OTE|5|I LOVE mor's hand creams.  They are so nice and thick.  I like this smell a lot, it's got a nice honey smell with a powder-y undertone.  I must say, some people HATE this scent, and cannot stand it though.  If you don't like powder-like smells, do not buy this.  The packaging on all their products is adorable, over time the gold details do wear off.  It really makes your hands soft and smooth.  I would totally buy more from this company.  However, the price on here is quite high, so shop around.
B00JAJNDZ6|1|I started taking the pills as stated on the directions. I even called to see if there were any side effects and if it was actually made for all women. What they do not tell you is that if you have eczema or sensitivity to some things within the pills, then you should not take them. I took the pills for two months, & I had gotten much itchiness in my Scalp. I could see a difference as to my hair being a bit thicker. I stop taking the medication because my scalp begin to develop a very bad rashand I had to go back to the doctor and explain to them that I was taking these pills. They told me now I have to wash my hair with a medicated shampoo because it developed a fungus in my scalp, and because I decided to stop taking the pills within those two months I did experience some hair loss around my edges. So instead of Hairfinity helping me, it has ruined my hair. Do not buy this product, and please do not use it on younger children, and if anything says it has no side effects, and it is too good to be true, do not believe it!
B005F15FL8|2|At first, it worked well but after only about 2 weeks in use, it wouldn't start, I charged it again and still nothing
B006KXA7EU|4|Worked great! Ladies at the salon loved the smell. The tinting is just enough to give you a great glow. Surprisingly happy
B00CHHJX0M|5|Good Product
B000A3I2X4|1|This thing is really weak. I travel a lot and the tiny foldable ones in hotels are more powerful.
B002NS3MNE|4|I purchased this kit about a year ago for my first CosMedix Timeless peel, but purchased the After Care kit through the same people to save a lot of money over what the Spa wanted to charge. This year, I decided to purchase both from the same company. No problems with either shipment, and the expiration date on both kits are in 2014.
B001CHCF7G|5|Delivery date was set for 9.15 and the product came today, one day early... Awesome. I've used the blade already and my face thanks you. I will definitely order from this company again.
B008VPC3ME|5|This was exactly what I was hoping for in a small bad. Love the bright orange color and it is very sturdy.
B0088P0QIU|5|This is the best hair spray  on the planet for those of us with long, fine hair.  It isn't sticky and it doesn't weigh hair down.  It holds my hair well and it is nice and soft to the touch.
B009SDEWAO|5|Great grip for the money. Allens are strong and true. Nice weight.
B00V1XBLL2|5|I have pretty sensitive skin so I'm always a little hesitant when using an &#34;exfoliating&#34; sponge on my face.  I had to try it (needed to update my beauty regimen!) and I was surprised at how effective yet gentle it was!  It's little yet powerful, and I'm still using the first one I purchased.  Great little sponge!
B0019RVJGC|5|I read the good and bad reviews about this product and decided to try it.  My nails have not looked this good in 20 years.  Yes, I experienced some loss of my nail bed on certain nails.  I stopped using it on those nails.  After a few weeks, the nail beds returned.  I would use a regular clear polish on the damaged nails and the Trind on the others.  I now use one coat of Trind on all my nails on the first day.  After that, I use another clear polish on the nails that had nail bed loss and use the Trind on the nails that did not have any adverse effect.  There's just a little trial and error to see if this can work for you.  It really worked for me.
B0095IMNI0|5|So far, a very effective waterpik. It's affordable and works as specified. Using it everyother day and then use standard toothbrush on the other days. I take sonic toothbrush when I travel.
B00G0U2BUG|5|Love these.  Makes me feel extra clean
B00TEFUUKW|4|Pros: the product is amazing. You can really see it work! It doesn't cover ALL blemishes but even so, it's still amazing!!! Remember, though, that this is for light to medium skin tones only.<br /><br />Cons: the product was 2 years old when I got it, according to the copyright on the back of the package. That bothered me.
B00336EUTK|5|It  works.  Period.
B000ZMAL2U|5|These clippers are great! I received them fast, and they were just what I wanted. They come with all the attachments you need for a good haircut!
B000FED5DU|5|i've basically stopped using blades since i purchased this electric razor. it should pay for itself with what i saved on the blades in no time.
B009L13HI6|5|LOVE this palette. I may be bias and love all Smashbox products, but this palette definitely comes in really handy.<br />It's small enough to put in my purse (as big as a metal wallet / cigar-case-style wallet) when I'm in a hurry and then put my makeup on when I arrive to work.<br /><br />Although it only comes in six colors, I was able to create a lot of combinations with them.<br />All the colors are super pigmented. Just the right amount of shimmer so it's good for day and night.<br />I am definitely stocking up on these before they're discontinued!
B007ZN0RPS|5|This facial mask is very effective for me. If I will take party next day, I will definitely use this product before I go. Love it！
B000VKZMHK|5|This razor was purchased for an uncle with vision limitations - never saw him respond with such pleasure - another resident who saw his had to have one which led to my second purchase within a couple of weeks.
B00FBQL8HC|5|Awesome product! Will buy again and highly reccomend
B000FBNYUM|5|I think that this pretty peach blush has been discontinued, as it's no longer available in stores.  That's too bad.  I've had mine for several years (I don't wear it that often) but I do love the color and it's very flattering on me. I'm light, but not fair, with neutral undertones, hazel eyes and dark blond hair.  I use it when I wear brown, khaki or orange.  It's almost impossible to apply too much of this blush.  It's very light and lends a flattering glow.  I have oily skin but this doesn't change color on me at all.  I think this would be equally nice on medium skin but perhaps too light for olive skin. And I love the little brush, it's just perfect for applying just the right amount of product.  All in all, I highly recommend this blush and hope it's not on the discontinued list.
B000WYZ9Q4|5|I love this mascara! Best I've used. Goes on quickly to create a great look. This is one of the only mascaras I've tried that doesn't cause damage to my pathetic eyelashes. But, I only use this version - I don't like the water proof version of the NYX Doll Eye Mascara - too gloopy.
B006L7SF4O|5|best primer
B00H8V6J2C|5|I love this brush!  The quality is great, and the brush is nice and soft. I also appreciate the follow-up emails that the seller provides.  Great product and great service!
B005ESAZ1M|4|Despite being a pastel shade, the polish had good opacity and was opaque in 2-3 coats. I had good wear with this polish, and the soak-off was not bad at all.
B001MIZMP2|5|Bought this for my boyfriend. He loves it, I love it, it's a great product for him, 3 in one. And you get three bottles for just one purchase. It lasts a while, and is a multipurpose product.
B006NXRD58|5|Just received the package.  It appears at first glance to be adequate EXCEPT the &#34;6-position trimming guide&#34; appears flimsy, especially the mechanism for latching into one of the six positions.  I suspect this may slip, if not immediately then eventually. UPDATE : It has worked well with no slips or breaks in the guide.  Actually, I am surprised that the clipper has worked well and reliably for quite a while now.
B00JRLGJ8A|5|GREAT PRODUCT.
B001DYM62C|5|very sharp works great
B000HZ9L8K|4|This Pumice Stone is really good at removing  callouse from your feet, i reccomend this to any one especially for those pretty summer sandals!
B003I71S6C|5|This helps older people who bruise easily.  It works best if you use it as quick as you realize  you are going to bruise.
B000GG6G10|5|I have used Brylcreem for many years. The only problem was having the right size for getting on an aircraft.<br />The size i ordered should take care of this problem.<br />I recommend this product to all my friends.<br />Your service was outstanding.<br />Thank you<br />Charles Bagley
B007BDF5VI|2|I got these for my daughters softball team and they are made with thin paper glued to elastic I have already had to sew it together so she can continue to wear it after wearing it once. Next time I will prob just make them myself net time.
B0049LUI9O|1|I purchased this in December of 2013 - and the thing didn't last even for one year. It eats batteries, the blades seem &#34;off&#34; even on first time use, etc. I can't believe that these have an average rating of four and one-half stars.<br /><br />EDIT: I just had to return and make certain that I didn't give this but one star. Going on almost three years, now, I tried it out again. Tried four different batteries. Doesn't really &#34;eat&#34; batteries so much as it just won't work, period, with brand new batteries.<br /><br />I tend to buy Panasonic products TOO much, I think, as they're generally middle-of-the-road in quality and price. No more: it's a false economy.
B000052Z9P|5|Whenever possible, I try to buy the 3pk of Lipsmackers because it saves some money.<br />I have been using this since high school. I have about every flavor. This stuff is great because it has a fun scent and it keeps my lips from getting chapped. I also like the ones with sparkles because I can wear it when I'm dressed up or just in jeans and a t-shirt.<br />The  rest of the Bonne Bell line of make-up is great, too. I use the foundation, Lip Flips and Roll-On Lip Gloss on a a daily basis.<br />This made a great gift for my then 12-year-old sister. It is a great age appropriate make-up. It isn't to dark, so she is learning how less is more with putting on her make-up.
B00QN22H1Y|5|Love the product llooks real
B000172RTO|2|It was fine, but just not what I was looking for
B007NCGKHU|4|This is a cute nail polish for kids! Its a little watery, so I had to reapply the color to get the sparkle pink or else it was a very light pink.<br />It seemed to dry fairly quick, which is nice.<br />I do like that is non toxic, odorless and eco friendly!
B0010KCPRK|5|one of my fav. perfumes, i love the soft clean smell, great price and a wonderful gift for someone you love.
B003IIN7WY|1|Never recieved the productfrom Sephora.  had to get a refund.  Net time l'll just order directly from the company.
B005TT8RA2|5|I love perfume and I was on the hunt for something affordable but with good quality.This perfume oil is very long lasting. I love jasmine and this is a pure jasmine scent. I wear it all the time just to smell myself. It lasts for a good 6-8 hours. If this is an indication of the other scents, I am now in line to try all the other ones. It was a bonus that the price was super affordable and the shipping was faster than even expected. Thumbs up Al-Rehab!
B006LAFU80|5|It has lots of body and easy to curl.
B00LGC5VJQ|1|Sonic did not meet my dental needs .Returned merchandise and requested  $ 60.00 refurnd .Thanks
B003LEXEDW|5|Good
B00CQ7K1OK|4|Love this line, keeps my skin drenched if you tend to have oily t zones then  try a sample first
B00G2TQNZ4|5|I've used this product for several weeks now, and I'm very satisfied.  It is extremely easy to use, only a small amount is needed, and I already see nice results.  I will definitely continue to use this Vitamin C Serum, and highly recommend this particular seller!
B00007M9SU|5|very lite, very compact, amazingly close shave. I use more often than my standard Braun shaver.  Great buy keep one in your car, in your briefcase. Good quality, easy to clean.
B003YQ1S9O|5|I wish they sold this in the states. I can only find it on amazon. In the summer time I use it for everything. I use it for my skin (and I don't burn with it), I use it in my hair, mostly on the ends, and I have even used it on my face and its amazing.
B0052L1YZC|5|Fast drying & no bubbles! Love this top<br />coat, especially when chasing a 2.5 year old after painting my nails!
B00027C8Q0|5|I get more compliments about this perfume than any other that I wear.  It is a super price and savings compared to department store prices.  I hope it will always be available through Amazon.
B0036YOTJK|5|It's so worth it! I love it
B003U27K0S|5|Great product...hydrating.  I have used this for 6 years
B0046VGJJA|5|Works great
B001WAKURU|4|Tack för en mycket snabb leverans av Nutra Luxe MD Intensive Lift Formula och riktigt bra pris på denna produkt.
B006G263NO|3|It was okay.... I enjoyed for 2 weeks and got some compliments on it...it was fab☺☺ I thought it was
B000P22ZX8|5|This is SUCH A LOVELY scent.  The seller/shipper did an A+++++ job at getting this to me.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.<br /><br />Happy customer!
B004UWZGX0|1|bad sketches of lettering its all blurred just a bad purchase my kids can draw better than whats in this 2 dollar a page book has in it
B0063I3RNA|5|Pro:<br />Smells great<br />great price<br />moisturizing<br />all natural!<br />you get a lot!
B000OLA2Y4|2|As a woman of color, (brown skinned), it didn't really do much for my complexion. It really depends on what you're looking for, and if you're the type of person who doesn't mind blending it with another lip gloss to enhance the color.
B008LQX8J0|4|Arrived fast however looked different than the picture, It had tighter curls so it was shorter and it was a brighter red. Overall though it was very pretty and I received many compliments while cosplaying both X-<br />Men's Jean Gray &#34;Phoenix&#34; and also Jessica Rabbit.
B000X1YING|4|These are a good buy considering the count and the price. I have thick long hair, so at times I needed to use more than one clip, but it was still worth it to buy these. They're cheaper than the clips you buy at CVS or Walgreens, and pretty much do the same job. Please thumbs up this review if it was helpful to you in anyway! I would really appreciate it :)
B002HWS4R0|5|I purchased this little beauty because I have a habit of forgetting to charge my razor.This is so much easier because I can just throw batteries in it if I need to. Okay, well that is a theory because I actually haven't had to change the batteries yet. It works just as well as my $80 shaver. Yes, it does miss hairs and you have to go over the area again, just like the more expensive ones. It also doesn't have as close a shave as using a disposable razor, but then, none of the electric ones do either. One of the nice things about this one is that it doesn't pinch the skin in my armpits or other &#34;sensitive&#34; areas. I highly recommend for the price and would actually recommend over the more expensive shavers.
B00CJIOG0Q|4|the rubber thing falls out a lot but when it stays in place it transfers image well.
B004TSFBNK|4|They are soft and apply makeup well. Only thing I would have liked is some eye shadow brushes. I use the large brush for foundation, the next size for bronzer, the flat brush for concealer.
B000U7XAJ6|1|Has no scent except alcohol, then fades to nothing within minutes. Not sure about other Demeter scents, but don't waste your money on this no-scent cologne. Very disappointing.
B002DPUY9C|5|I love Burt's Bees products, and this one is another winner.  I use oils in the bath and after the shower to keep my skin moisturized, especially in the winter.  I usually use straight vitamin e oil, but decided to try this one.  A bit heavier than what I'm used to, but smells great and absorbs well.
B001NP5OTI|4|When I first saw a magazine advertisement for this new cologne by Sean John, I sort of figured it would be just the opposite of his previous toilette, Unforgiveable.  By that, it was assumed it would be a much heavier scent--musky and woodsy.  Well, what a pleasant surprise.  I am King is a delightfully fresh, light scent--even lighter than Unforgivable--with citrusy highlights.  It's very clean and unobtrusive. Highly recommended.
B00LQDQ5KE|1|Completely misleading. They show 10 and state 10 different but nowhere do they state &#34;this is one bottle&#34;. $22 is what I paid for 1 bottle of this stuff. Disappointed
B003WN1ELQ|4|Recommended by my dermatologist for my rash-prone skin.  Doesn't leave a sticky or heavy feeling on your face.  Comes in both AM and PM formulas, but I only use once a day so my skin can breath.  Also has SPF protection.
B00028OSI0|5|I use this in lieu of lotion and apply it as soon as I get out of the shower. It has improved my skin tremendously.
B00AAJOZN4|5|If you're purchasing this because you think you get the 3 tweezers-you're wrong only comes one and you get which ever color they send to you which it says in the description box but I did not read :). However, it's small and can easily get those stubborn brow hairs out. I mainly use them for applying eyelashes though which works wonders since it's so small!
B008JWW914|3|The bigger brushes shed a little which was disappointing, so i just dont use them. But other than that great brushes !
B008SGKHEW|5|Works wonders for me. Really makes my skin smooth and even in tone.  I use on acne prone areas especially like back and shoulders.  Also smooths out my face though I don't really have acne there.  Can be a bit drying so tone and moisturize after you use.  I purchase again and again.
B001G7PW5Y|5|They are great. He loves them
B006MAPN4K|4|I love fimo fruit, fimo animals, everything fimo for my nail art :)  These are great, although I couldn't tell what all of them were.
B001E0VWNO|5|Have been using this brand for years.
B000RQAM50|4|This was my first time using wax at home. The product says you don't need strips and you probably don't, but I used them anyway. The wax worked great and I'm hooked.
B002WDXCX0|2|I had a sample of this product from Sephora, and I loved it -- which is why I looked for the full product.  It's so expensive to buy from them, so I found it through Amazon.  To my dismay, when I began pumping it (the sample had an applicator, which I like must better), it was water.  I tried shaking vigorously hoping that the water and the primer would mix, but they won't.  A hard lesson.  I will only buy this product directly from Sephora now -- some things you truly get what you pay for.
B0000C4COW|3|Still too early to tell
B00A7INXD6|5|wife loved it
B00390FH5G|5|best stuff to straighten curly hair and keep it from fizzing
B000E7WHLY|5|I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone it smells so wonderful!! Its great for a gift anyone will be happy with it.
B00599PMAK|5|At first, I didn't think I'd like this body was, but after I first tried it I couldn't go back to what I was using before. I then searched on amazon.com and found a 3 pack and was thrilled. I decided to order it. It was a pretty good deal. $25.00 for 3 large bottles of body wash. I'm sure I'll end up searching when I'm on my last bottle. Thanks to Amazon they weren't hard to find.
B000PARERW|4|I tried this without my hopes too high. I lived on a beach for years so my chest really could use some pampering. I've only used this twice, but its already appreciated. My boyfriend doesn't appreciate as much as I do of course, but I can wear it under a shirt. So far its worth every penny. I will try to update this after a few months.
B00TTUTRJC|3|It makes my hair soft after applying it, however I did not like its smell.
B009HYNLUG|5|The hair is pretty and it does last  longer. I would  recommend  this product.
B000Q8ISXM|5|My ophthalmologist suggested I use this daily in the shower to keep from getting reoccurring blepharitis (infection of the eyelids). It has worked fine; no sting, and I leave it on while I'm showering. It does not need to be rinsed.
B00JEMRAOY|5|&#34;Love, love love Andalou products!  Highly recommend if you have Celiac or gluten sensitivity.
B0013KEA5M|5|I have written many reviews, for this foam permanent.  Because I use them three times a year.  I am very happy with them.  The foam stays in place and is not as messy as the liquid perms were.  The foam is also faster.
B001KYU2OO|4|It Is everithing OK. Tks
B001BBOLSY|5|I love this product because it makes my eyebrows look just as good as when i just get them waxed. It doesn't feel like theres anything on your eyebrow, which is also a plus. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, but especially to people with dark eyebrows who don't always pluck them as much as they should.
B000JNQSIQ|4|Better than most home cutters
B0020MMBXA|5|Good
B00ZPYYG4C|5|It works very well on me! I use it every night before I am going to bed like the instruction said. So far I had use it about 2weeks. And my eye lashes did get a litter longer. I will continue use it.
B00K7VJYA4|4|I got the White/Red Wig. This wig is awesome! This is the first wig that I will own/bought online and it was a pretty good experience. I really like how it flows when you move around or when you whip it over your shoulder. It came faster than expected so I was able to use it for Halloween. Apart from the wig it also included a set of 2 wig caps and a sample temporary tattoo. That was a nice touch lol.<br />It sheds like no freaking other so if you don't want to deal with that then you best look somewhere else. It does tangle and frizz after awhile and I'm still new to wigs so I'm not sure how to fix that. I wish that there was more red on the outside of the wig than on the inside. It just looks like a White/Pink wig to me because of that.<br />All in all I really love it I'd definitely buy from MapofBeauty again. ;D
B0015KXNMQ|5|Love love love! I need another bottle of this for my desk. I use it as a pick me up during the day and also I put 2 drops in my vanilla protein shake in the morning, so good!
B0041VGWGA|5|I use these to wipe down high chairs in restaurants, tables my baby will touch, and shopping carts. It's a powerful cleaner but without chemicals. I love that it kills germs, smells nice, AND is safe for my infant's face and hands. To us, that's the trifecta ;) I carry a few in a Baggie, I don't lug this big container around. I love them.
B005V4ZLNG|5|This oil is just what it says.  The quality is great.  I am so glad to find good essential oils on amazon.  So many oils are overpriced because they are from multilevel businesses. I am glad to find affordable oils that are just as good quality.  I will be coming back for more.
B002H6R5ZS|2|It has a metallic look to it...it's more like &#34;black sparkle&#34; than &#34;black pearl&#34;.
B001QTW2FK|5|Perfect Dryer ! This has replaced my larger Conair. My MiniPro  is so easy on the hair with only 1200 watts so compact and lite makes hair styling very easy and fast. Going to buy another one for spare. LOVE IT
B00AREI3S0|4|Smells great. Nothing bad for your locks in this shampoo.  Doesn't dry your hair out like most shampoos.
B00E5QAHHQ|5|Finally a tanning product that did not turn me orange!
B00KIE9VJ4|5|good product, good price at the time that I bought.
B00BRW1AFO|4|This hair clip is absolutely beautiful but very heavy so would not work with fine hair but my granddaughter has very long course hair so it works great for her.
B0036R6SL4|5|My dark circles have almost disappeared with only a few uses of this cream! I am truly in awe! The texture is light, smooth, and has a clean, fresh smell. It does not irritate my eyes as do some creams I've used in the past.<br /><br />I received a sample and I am about to place my first order.
B003PVY83G|5|Product is great. leaves your hair shiny and healthy with just a drop of use.. And it smells really great.
B000YB3RCS|5|After having bought and used over many years I find the Kent superior to any others I have used.  I've pitched several of my previously used.
B0039UTV3A|5|I have the infamous T-zone. I have tried Nars, Estee Lauder, MAC, Clinique, Benefit, etc. and i keep coming back to this. I have finally learned my lesson and just stick with Revlon ColorStay Foundation. The other foundations dry my skin out and make the T-zone even more oily but this one works perfectly! I use MAC's Fix + then I use Revlon Color Stay and I am set for the day. Friday is my busiest/longest day, I do my makeup at 7:30 am, i place some blotting powder around 12, once i come out of work i just spray MAC's Fix+ and by the time i'm home, around 11 pm my face still looks impeccable. I definitely recommend this for T-zone faces it is better than any High End Foundation.
B005SHR4LS|1|Made my hair look greasy.
B00ABIF3A8|5|I have spent 2 weeks on the caribbean summer and this is the very first summer that my skin does not peel of when very tanned. I had the most perfect tan ever!
B00DSTCYQS|5|this is absolutely the best stuff for cuticles'.  actually I use it for the part of the finger around the nail.  keeps this area soft and smooth.  My fingers have a tendency to build up a dense, hard skin around the finger.  this often cracks during the winter.  this particular product totally eliminates this problem.  It is a whoopee find for me.
B001ET76GW|5|We have been using this since our son was born. He is a very allergic kid and cant use any product... this one was medical recommended and fit the hole immediately.<br />Its an awesome hydrating lotion for all ages. My father wich has dryied skin use that as well with awesome results!<br /><br />Way to go! Buy it now!
B0080D1Q8E|5|Bought this for my boyfriends tired and achy feet. Works great at cooling and soothing your feet. Makes feet soft
B006L1DNWY|5|These pen brushes are great!! They are well made and easy to use. Having all sorts of different shapes really makes it easy to create your own nail designs. I use one of the brushes to do french nails and it is much much easier to control brush stroke compared to using my regular nail polish brush.<br /><br />The wait was long, since it's shipped from China, but it was well worth it and I will buy from this vendor when these need replacement.
B00243FMDQ|4|ok
B003MC99O6|5|Managed my keratin treatment very well. Kept it soft and smooth.
B004FWEOV0|5|Just wanted to say that the price is good for the quility that you get. no complaints from my customers at all.
B00GDULTRE|3|You get what you've paid for and its just &#34;ok&#34; hair if you dont have a lot of money in your pocket.  The closure is actually pretty decent tho
B007E2R7TY|5|Very good buying ,quality , and shipping !
B0050VAIBK|1|No, I could get the same thing at the Dollar Store.
B00JWT2W5Q|5|Excellent product
B009W8UHK4|5|This is the truth! I have been going to a ton of events lately and I have needed my makeup to stay flawless all day! This does the trick. Sure some other makeup products like this do too, but for this refreshing price & feeling! I, think not! I've always loved E.L.F., now even more so.
B0006GK61Q|5|i used these for a photo shoot because actual cigarettes were way too expensive. these look just like cigarrettes and got the job done.
B00VORM4MA|5|My girlfriend liked it
B00006IV2F|2|hair gets tangled in it
B00JRTK5U0|5|Excellent ! Great product , natural look ,. Love it
B001HKR6WM|5|I had always used whatever brush came with the make-up I was using. I thought I would try these Elf brushes after reading great reviews. Not only is the price is great, these are quality brushes. You get a bunch of them-and the bristles do not fall out. It has really helped with my make-up application.
B0006ZYPVE|1|It was s***! Don't recommend to anyone.
B00B0F3FAG|5|Received in a timely manner. The product is everything it is advertised as plus easy to use. It seems very sterile and safe for it's intended usage.
B0002JBO18|5|Absolutely great, very fresh and still feminine. An intriguing perfume that can't be easily forgotten (I recognize it on other women in the tram...). Can be worn from morning to evening without being too much or too little.
B000U99TWQ|4|I did expect the handle to be longer. I thought to use it to get to the hard to reaches of my back with ease. I also did not understand the wording  'Pink with silver shimmer' I found out that there is silver shimmer powder in the puff. Not that that was the puff, bow and stick coloring.
B0084FBH1O|5|I tend to buy high end shears . I thought I would take a chance on this set and was pleasantly surprised there every bit as good as shears twice the price
B000VHYLFW|4|It is the only one I found that works. The only problem is the band streches out. Need adjustable band.
B000F63TW0|5|I adore this product! I'm a redhead with alabaster skin. You know. The sensitive kind. I'm an ivory girl. After using this my skin just shines and gleams. I look like I'm blushing but not red. It's gentle enough for me but scrubby wonderful enough to make my face look lovely.
B005XP4YNQ|5|Been using this product for 3 months in conjunction with pure argan oil for my face. Immediately following a shower aI pat my face dry apply this solution then a small amount of argan oil. My face does not get oily throughout the day and it smooths out fine lines and wrinkles
B001VEK1HQ|5|fine products.  reliable  quality.  A sale of cleaner cartridge, bundled sith shaver cassette<br />would result in lower price, and probably increase volume.
B0051S594I|2|I had this perfume before, and when it arrived, i must say it was perfectly packaged, brand new box and clear wrap, even a sticky of original guarantee. everything seemed fine, except when i went to spray it, for some reason it seemed to have much more alcohol in it and does not even last that long. as soon as i spray it, it vanishes within minutes. so i dont know if this is even an original..... if its copied, it was a really good copy cause everything is  perfect form the appearance.
B003C548NA|5|These were a hit .... Easy to apply and lasted even after I got rained on.
B001WX0F86|5|Works great Smells even better
B0017QT5J8|4|This shampoo smells nice and has a decent rating from EWG, so a nice kid-safe shampoo. Not much in the way of conditioning, but my son has very thick hair that gets crazy easily...
B008J27PFY|3|Great exfoliator and oil is great as a moisturizer for your skin and the smell is wonderful. I didn't see an improvement on my stretch marks as it claim but my niece that has fresh ones did see a big improvement.
B00AP1BTZE|4|Love it, my makeup looks good now,only thing I didn't like was that it came bent but other than that it's a good quality brush.
B00094O6D4|5|Amazing in every way.
B005E9HG18|5|amazing stuff
B00112DS3M|5|I love the size...fits perfect in my little belted purse.  Don't know why Maybelline discontinued this product...it's a perfect size.
B000186XAM|5|This face wash is the best! I've been using it for years.  It always leaves my face feeling clean but not tight or dry.
B002XURD32|5|I use this system almost everyday. It definitely helps cleanse and exfoliate the skin and is easy to use. I would recommend this product!
B00F7PUAX0|4|i love it. I use it for hair and skin. It doesn't have a color. I do mask for my hair: kefir, tea oil, henna
B007R96MKO|1|I have always purchased same from amazon or my hairstylist but this time  it smells completely different. Also my hair did not feel at all like it normally does with the shampoo I buy other times. This leads me to conclude that it is either very old, or more likely counterfeit packaging of another product. I was very disappointed and feel I was ripped off.
B0074EGOH8|5|i use products of dollywink for years ,and i can't find a better one~but just a little expensive ,but it worth~
B00E2R2LGI|5|they work wonderfully !!
B000F5AG5E|3|It creates great curls but doesn't hold at all, even with hairspray.  I have asian hair that's slightly wavy with medium thickness.  Curling my hair with a flat iron leaves me with curls that last, but this doesn't hold at all.
B000XSOQ9A|5|great
B0092ZJ4EC|5|This has been by far the best skin care kit I have EVER purchased! I have incredibly sensitive skin that will break out in hives, simply from entering a room with certain air freshners. I also will have dry patches that just appear suddenly and larger pores. My face would also flush and become blotchy, for no obvious reason.  From the moment I applied this product I could tell it was going to work for me. My skin truly felt comforted by the cleanser and the creams. I absolutely love this product, and have been using it for 2 months now. I don't expect to ever waste my money on other facial products, since these are the best I've ever used. In the two months since using them my skin has been transformed to smooth, radiant, break out free skin.<br />I was getting to the point I was making excuses for the way my skin appeared. Since using these products my skin literally glows. Thank you, Dermalogica for the products my skin needed!
B008MMITQK|5|like my other horse hair brush this performed well with my tabac soap. this is a great alternative to boar and is soft. remember it needs to be broken in due to the smell. great product
B001AHFZ7A|2|definitely works but leaves skin looking scaly, tried if mixed with foundation, didn't seem to work half as well
B00L2W5PHS|4|beware....it runs small
B000052Y6L|4|Works as described. A little faster than I imagined.
B008E4S9H0|5|I'm very satisfied of my purchase, very fast shipping
B00120VWJ0|2|I researched the hell out of Dr. Bronner's when I wanted a more natural shampoo/soap, and it received nothing but positive responses - so I bought it in Peppermint.  The smell is lovely, but it DOES NOT wash my hair, though it is advertised as an 18-in-1 magic soap - shampoo included.<br /><br />Let me preface by saying I have VERY thick hair.<br /><br />The first time I noticed that it wasn't clean was while I was camping.  After a shower, the back of my hair felt wet and heavy for WAY too long, so I checked it out in the bathroom, and it looked like my hair was greasy and filled with residue.  At first I dismissed it based on the water pressure from camping.<br /><br />When I returned home, I used Dr. Bronner's on my hair two days in a row, taking special care to make sure my hair was completely rinsed.  By the second day, my hair was gnarly and matted in the back.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even using this as a body wash makes my skin feel tight.<br />I REALLY wanted to like this shampoo. I was hoping it would change my life.
B00K5B8O8O|2|Stylish yet not to sharp.
B00FFANXMM|5|I have only used this product for a week but have already seen results with a crease I have had above my jaw area.  It was very pronounced but now is nearly invisible.  I can't wait for more results after I have used it longer.
B0044LMVUS|1|These are the worse set of polishes I've ever bought.  All of the colors but one are completely transparent. You cant even get<br /> more coverage with addional coats. It just looks messy. The one color that is opaque is pretty but chipped up completely the very first day I applied it. This is with base and top coat. Unless you want a bunch of colors that look like milky base coats dont waste your money.
B00RAMF7GI|5|This is better than a high end potion I bought! I paid 65$ for a serum from a high end store before I ordered the vitamin c serum from hete! I use the vitamin c serum everyday have been using it for about 3 weeks I'm 52& have wrinkles on my eyelids & on my top lip I've already noticed a difference on my eyelids! The high end serum nothing! I will most definitely order this vitamin c serum again & do recommend it to my family & friends!!!
B00776D7Z0|2|For the price of the curling iron I expected more. It stopped heating soon after I bought it, and the clamp was not strong enough to hold my hair in place until it was curly.
B00IDWP4IA|5|good stuff
B002PQ8BQM|5|Works as described on package.
B00D62I5X8|5|I absolutely love this product! It moisturizes, it softens and heals your skin. I used it on my daughter after a bath every day. I even started using it myself. Does it come in bigger than 8 oz.?
B00J8UJNU6|2|So far it hasn't done a thing for me but I will use the product until the end.
B00JUJ1KM4|5|Great scent for all genders!
B0037TM252|5|(Posting on my wifes Amazon Prime account)<br /><br />I don't usually write reviews but I feel I need to give encouragement for anyone who might have been in the same situation as me before I purchased this product!<br /><br />I'm a male in my early 30's and have a family history of hair loss.  I actually began losing my hair in high school so having a product like Lipogaine available (that actually works!) is amazing.  I've been using Lipogaine for about a year now and I couldn't be happier with the results.  My hair is MUCH thicker and it's helped my confidence a lot.  I actually used it previously for a few months but got discouraged and impatient because I didn't notice the results I was looking for.  My wife encouraged me to give it another try and I'm very grateful I listened to her advice!<br /><br />Long story short, if you're on the fence about getting this product, get it and be patient.  Use it as directed and I'm confident you'll love the results just like I am!
B003V37Z6U|5|This norelco shaver  shaves as close as razor. Battery has held up great. I can shave for 70 minutes with charge.
B00JKAD0MQ|2|Ingredients: SilverSol Solution (deionized water and purified silver), xylitol, carbomer, TEA, natural coloring and peppermint oil.<br />So I will not reorder, but make my own. Their liquid silver is the best as far as I am concerned!
B0084PXVX6|4|I enjoyed the texture of the Shea butter, mixed well as a base for my body butters. Stores well and a little goes a long way.
B001E722V8|5|What a great scent! This is an excellent refresher for third-day hair, post-workout refreshment, or any time you need a little lavender scented lift. I use this all the time and absolutely love it!
B00I073WLE|4|The smell of this moisturizer reminds me of shampoo - not unpleasant but it's not what I would associate with something I put on my face.  Although I don't see my age spot fading, I believe it has helped with the uneven tone of my face.  I like to go without makeup on weekends. Before using this product, my face without makeup seemed uneven and dull.  After using, my face seems brighter and more even. I use it only in the morning as I use another lifting and firming cream at night.
B009PIJV1W|5|The bast seller<br />I love the freash<br />It is greet to ues and ti is lot of freash to ues for 3 month
B003FBI9LS|3|works good
B003ATLPUW|5|Oh my! just beautiful hair
B008PJZXT6|5|I love this! I use it all the time. My only &#34;problem&#34; is the grip. I think for me the other version with the handle would be easier to hold.
B00K4EQHGI|5|Best lippie ever.
B00KYF03BM|5|I really enjoy the way this applies makeup! This is the first sponge of this type that I have ever uesd and I think it blends out my foundation perfectly. The very first time I used it I thought it was a little stiff but it seems the more I use it the bouncier it gets. I love it!
B000VDCDYW|2|I guess &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; Cheap, Flimsy, doesn't stay wish I had bought a more expensive one.
B005NCJ7FO|4|Nice palette!
B009EJI2JO|5|I bought it for my daughter.  She says it's what she wants for Christmas.  She gave me the little box so I would get her the correct perfume.  She absolutely loves it.  She doesn't know yet that I already received it from Amazon.  She keeps reminding me.
B00113NTP8|5|This cream is a winner. We live in Colorado where it is extremely dry in winter. This lotion keeps our skin soft. And they smell delicious too.
B003HOFAYW|5|Helps keep in my red color hair I'm satisfied with my purchase and I was recommended by a friend to give it a try.
B004INUWX0|5|Works great.
B0049WUFMS|5|The product is lightweight, the cord swivels, and there is an adjustable temperature dial. What more could I ask for?
B001FQWZHE|2|I used the first order and my hair fell out a lot in the tub.  It also left my hair heavy and with no sheen.  I returned my second order.
B0058P73I4|5|Bought this for my daughter for a xmas present , and she loves it , helps her keep everything more organized
B001DMOA3W|5|I use this consistently. It is not only a heat  protector, it helps your hair hold the style.
B0010KO4ME|5|I use this for two things. One is to put on my lips before bed, the other is my main use which is as eye makeup remover. I have tried like fifteen different eye makeup removers and this is the only one my eyes can tolerate long term. Others make my eyelids (top and bottom) red, dry/scaly and unbearably itchy after prolonged use. But not this. I take a dab, massage it onto my eyelids, let sit for a few seconds, take a baby wipe and wipe clean. And to be honest it takes everything off quickly without any harsh rubbing unlike a lot of eye makeup removers I've used.
B003NRYG1Q|5|Have seen many magnification mirrors but this one takes the cake. Good quality. Nice and heavy so it will not tip and easy to handle. And the 15x is not distorted like a lot are. Not just a small section of the other side of the mirror, but the whole side is 15x.
B000K5WQKW|5|Excelente!!!
B0006IQJFQ|5|I have used Dermalogica skin care products for > 15 years now... The salon I use for facials used it and I use only Demalogical products for facial cleansing; their body wash, body toner, body creadm... love the herbal aroma and I'm asleep 5 minutes afterwards.
B001V9T3F2|2|creates extreme blurriness!  Not usable during the day when one needs to see!
B004D2C4Q4|5|Received this item on time and the price was good. I use this every night and it's really gentle. Not greasy. It works well. It lasts more than a month.
B0018OXOUA|5|After looking at razor blade cartridge replacement costs, I decided to go with a safety razor and bought this brush for my venture. It was definitely different using a brush to apply shaving cream, but I think I will continue to enjoy the experience in the future. This brush is a good brush. I honestly don't have other brushes I can compare it to, but it did just fine applying the shaving soap. I felt using a brush did raise the hairs on my face more than applying shaving soap with your hand.     About the brush itself, it is not heavy. I kind of expected the handle to have a little more heft to it. I am not displeased with this product though, and I hope it lasts a long time. I strayed away from buying one of the wood-handle brushes as I've read some reviews about the finish coming off of them. I would recommend getting a brush stand with this to make sure it dries with the bristles aiming down.
B000VUO8VG|5|I had been having problems with severe dryness and brittleness of my hair. I purchased this product because my hair dresser uses Mizani products on my hair. Well, with one use, my hair went from straw to soft, bouncy and shiny. Can't wait to see how it looks in a week!
B00F9X34XS|5|Handle is bigger than the older ones but still works great.
B002RBF1PO|5|is what I like and this product fits perfect to my style. Looks like it will last a lifetime so if it does it will really save me on cost from buying all those crappy disposable razors. Much better shave than any cheap razor from the stores. The big marketing razor companies made us believe we need 4, 5, 6 razor to shave with. What a bunch of crock! This one safety razor works way better. This razor will pay for it self in a few months. Trust me! buy this razor cause it will be the last one you will ever have to buy. And you will feel like a real man after you are done shaving. Buy a brush with some manly cream too!!!
B00FQPOPNW|2|The bar was delivered crumbling/broken-- Amazon Prime packed it with other small items in a small box and that seems to have broken the bar.  It quickly started breaking apart even more with use, most of it wound up on the floor as opposed to on the underarm.  Loved the scent but I got wicked, red, itchy rash after about 1 week of use.<br /><br />I did not use any kind of deodorant and used a topical prescription strength hydrocortisone/baby powder for a few days and this seemed to resolve the rash but the rash came back when I resumed using conventional antiperspirant + deodorant.  The rash is not responding to topical hydrocortisone or powder. Does anyone have any successful tips/treatments?  Thank you
B002PIR1JS|5|Nice scent!
B008PDM4IA|5|Perfect for my eyes I trim a Little off the ends  but I think how pretty they are.
B00IGGYAH4|1|Didn't work at all. I left it on for about 15 minutes which is longer than directed and still saw no change in hair color.
B00CXAC6UM|5|This brush is absolutely wonderful.  If you hate brushing your hair after showering, the Wet Brush will change your life!  I know I'm being a bit dramatic, but truly - please give it a try.  I have very long, very thick hair.  Combing my hair after the shower is never a fun task, and now it takes literally 20 seconds.  I bought one for one of my best friends who has even thicker hair than I do (she's tried detanglers, etc.), and she can't believe how great it is.<br /><br />Basically, if you were debating this purchase, do it.  You won't regret it.  And it's so affordable considering how wonderful it is!  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B009NSNZ2K|5|Like Vitalzym, this is good for joints, swelling, and the surprises of aging.
B002A8JO48|5|Last year I purchased this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend.  He absolutely loves it!  He has used it ever since.
B00T11B5Y4|5|Great product.  Have been rubbing a few drops of it at my temples and on the back of my neck when I get a sinus headache and it has helped a lot.
B00JAOUJ5I|5|The best.  I love natural soaps. Lavender smeels SO good!
B005V1J9PK|5|First off the brushes were delivered way before the estimated delivery date.  I have been told for so long that for flawless makeup you must use \\"good\\" brushes, I could never seem to get my self to spend so much money on a makeup brush, I finally broke down and bought a Sigma set.  AMAZING!  There are reasonably priced, and do wonders for my makeup application.  My makeup goes on smooth and seems to stay put longer.  Definatley a good buy!
B003CP12O8|4|I got a free sample of this mouthwash thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. I have been using this product for almost two months now and I absolutely love the product. It makes my mouth feel so healthy and clean without the painful alcohol burn. I find that I actually use it on a regular basis because I don't dread the terrible burn that I associate with mouthwashes. I am definitely converted over to this product as my new go to mouthwash!
B005F1ILHS|2|I have not seen any change since I started using the product.  Hair looks fuller and soft, but no new hair..
B0037TCH4S|1|Gimmick.
B003WR2T5W|4|Take it one to two times a day , seems to help clear the fog out of this 55 year old brain.
B00B3DYF1S|5|This is the best hair straightener I have ever owned. Highly recommended to anyone who wants the best.
B00HE56ORM|4|I like it but color does not match my hair
B00F5KDIGI|2|Very good for cheap
B00GP2N66W|2|This eye cream didn't work for my dark circles and left dry flakes under them. But I asked for a refund and was kindly given one. They are 100% on their policy!
B0060OAAGO|4|While these are the only facial cloths that don't irritate my skin and eye areas, I am not happy with the new packaging and would prefer the individual packaging brought back.  Some changes are good, but not this one.
B00C676V94|5|Great Covergirl product. I keep buying it.
B000JNQSIQ|5|Simple to use, and now I don't have to pay for haircuts anymore!
B00KSLK86M|4|I've been a dedicated Lip Trip user for 15 or 20 years (was previously a Carmex addict) and recently learned the sunscreen in Lip Trip was something to avoid. I haven't liked most other brands I've tried, and wanted something in which beeswax was first ingredient. I think this one is going to fit the bill, although I wish the mint wasn't so strong (I am going to try the Vanilla and the Honey, but really, I don't think I want any flavor in my lip balm--it's not to eat!) It goes on a bit more oily than I like, and compared to Lip Trip I feel like I need to reapply more often (say 24 times a day instead of 8) but this might just be adjusting to the drying feeling of the mint? After 4 days of using it, though, I do think it's doing its moisturizing job, and I like that all the ingredients are natural and healthy. I'm saving my last tubes of Lip Trip for when I need the sun protection...
B000UBNOA2|5|I am an owner of over 50 shades of nail polish, all Essie or OPI. This is one of my favorite, go-to nude shades! It's a very pale taupe, with the slightest hint of lilac. It's opaque in just two creamy coats. Definitely one of my favorites from Essie!
B009PMZBLC|5|perfect price, delivery, quality! thanks
B000P253EG|5|I have NO idea what the person whose review said a better scent was pleasures....I hate pleasures but, absolutely love addict 2!!!! I wore it on my wedding day & have worn it ever since.I guess you could say I'm totally addicted x 2!!!! I smelled everything when shopping for my wedding fragrance, and after much deliberation kept going back to this one.It's fresh, romantic, & you just want to smell it again & again. I have since bought 4 bottles, as it has been 5 yrs since my wedding day. I still love it just as much & hope they never stop making it. It's such a great scent, u just have to smell it for yourself & fall in love! I can't compare it to anything else. Not overpowering but, not too subtle that you can't even smell it. PERFECTION in a bottle!!!!!!!! :)
B00563JQBU|4|This is the second time I am buying this cream, fully satisfied and will get another one when the time comes
B003JMYYQW|3|Didn't come with directions on how to use, though that might be a no brainer for some.  When it wasn't as effective as I thought it would be, I couldn't tell if I was doing it wrong.....  My hairdresser commented on how few and far between the bristles were which would account for it not being as smoothing.
B00FOY84HI|4|I really like this is set for the price. I recently found out about Paul Mitchell products when I went to my local SportsClips & this is what they use. When they washed my hair my head had a cool tingling sensation. The Leave-In conditioner is my favorite good for your face & hair! A little goes a long way.
B00K2686AS|5|I love this product. It works wonders on my eczema. Trick is you need to keep using it even AFTER the condition clears. It may come back if you stop. I wish you would deliver to Canada though.
B000VP7COQ|5|Good taste and not overpowering. It's water resistant but comes off when you use soap and leaves your skin feeling super soft. It's a great excuse for getting a back rub.
B0078DXKLI|1|I bought 2 shampoos and 2 conditioners (the big ones) back in April at the owners appreciation weekend at my local co-op. It was expensive. Almost $55 in total. I began using them after I finished what I had, which was around the end of April. And that's when I started having trouble. My hair looked fine, but towards the end of the day I would get really bad dandruff. It was a soft, weird type of dandruff that would fall in big chunks on my shoulders. It was a bit nasty. First I thought it may have been stress, but then I tried giving my hair a break from the 2chic shampoo and conditioner and trying something else and that's when I noticed that when I would use other shampoos for a couple of days, I wouldn't get the weird dandruff. And when I would go back to 2chic, the dandruff came back.<br /><br />I've stopped using them and have been using regular Pantene and my scalp is back to healthy. I've never been so disappointed in shampoo and conditioner. Don't buy these.
B0009XH6SC|4|I was searching for a cheap flat iron to store at my boyfriend's house so that I would not have to transport my Solia 1 1/4'' Ceramic Tourmaline   back and forth each weekend.  I wanted a product that looked similar to my Solia since I was already accustomed to using it.   I found this one and purchased it due to high reviews.  It arrived the next day (bonus points), even though I received free shipping.  At a price a little over $17, this item met all my expectations.  Some reviewers on other sites have stated that this Andis is just as good if not better than a $100+ CHI, but I highly doubt that is so.  When I opened the product from its plastic case, I could tell right away that the quality was not comparable to my Solia which was ~$85.  So if you are able to spend the extra dollars, definitely go for a higher end iron, as it is much worth its price.  Anyhoos, as for this specific product, it is able to go up to 375 degrees (as stated on its packaging).  However, the heat dial on the iron is not in units of degrees, rather it is on some sort of scale from 0-20.  First I set the dial to 15, but felt the heat radiating from it from a foot away, so I truned the dial down to 10.  It heated up in about a minute.  I have found that I could get my hair straight on the first go if I just went slowly with a small section of hair at a time.  I had permed my hair into loose waves last Decemeber, and now that it's grown out a bit, I have found the curls to look a bit awkward and prefer to straighten it when I have the time.  For reference, I have thick, Asian hair that is naturally pretty straight (but now chemically permed).  I was able to straighten my hair in less than 10 minutes, taking care to straighten the bottom, middle, and top portions separately.  I used VO5 Heat Defense spray to protect my hair and let it dry prior to ironing.  However, I did not feel that my hair was as smooth or as shiny as when I used my Solia.  A couple times while I was ironing with the Andis, I could feel the plates catching a couple hairs and pulling them out (ouch).  While this product is a good purchase for $17, I am glad that I will only be using this only the weekends and not everyday.
B000V8MTIC|5|My hair is really realllyyy thick and used to be so hard to blow dry out and I dread it every time I washed my hair. To me this changed  the texture of my hair for the better. I oil my head about 2 times a week and a day before I wash my hair. It made such a big difference , it made my hair softer and manageable like it says on the bottle. The smell is weird but it doesn't bother me at all, and I don't think anybody else noticed the smell on me. Its also not that greasy like I thought it would be. I also apply a very small amount to my hair before I flat iron my hair. But so far I haven't noticed much growth, but for me that isnt a problem because of all the other benefits it gave me. I also have been inconsistent which probably will be a factor in growth, but I will be buying more now that i'm out.
B00S3ZM0F2|5|definitely a winner
B003H146PY|5|Good Product
B0043LWO3S|4|The product works very well and provides complete coverage. It has a waxlike texture that adheres to the hair well. I use it mainly for those few stray greys around the hairline that appear a few weeks after coloring. The applicator brush is small so I wouldn't recommend it for large areas of coverage. Also try to minimize running your fingers through your hair because it will leave your fingernails stained like you've been digging in the garden. It looks very natural and washes out very easily.
B00KASUYOO|5|Great brush, different bristles on each side, creates soft curl.
B00DINCJKK|5|I had to buy my friend who does fantasy makeup as a living these were a perfect gift for her she absolutely loved them. I used one on my friend for Halloween and it looked like I spent time on her makeup but not even. Easy to apply and hassle free to remove!! The wait is worth it.<br />Ps it come in like a week or two earlier that excepted.
B000NL0T1G|5|I love this safety razor. It has transformed how I shave. Solid design and comfortable handling make this a real weapon against facial hair.
B001E96OUQ|5|one of my favorites and love the fragrance
B0027EJIZK|2|This is a very strange type of lotion.  It applies to the face in a slippery almost slimy type feel something like a beaten egg.  On the face, it felt tight like I had a mask on or something but the idea was to use it under my makeup.   Basically, I felt like I had smeared a beaten egg on my face.  I felt like I needed to wash my face.  I did not notice any difference in my skin on my face but then again, I was only able to use it for about 12 days because the stuff turned a yukky orange/brown in the bottle before I had it even two weeks.  The instructions in the package said to discontinue use if it changed colors.    So the answer is NO.  I would not buy this product again.  It was not for me.
B003BVINQI|5|awesome product great razor works a million times better than gillete mad smooth and no cuts and leaves my face feeling wonderful and soft
B001SXNQDG|5|Smaller than I thought they would be; but they stay in place just like the larger ones.
B000092OX4|4|good, I can feel it working.  Rated #1 with consumer reports above all the high priced lotions & potions.  However after awhile my face shines a little and I prefer a more \\"matt\\" look
B00OPCU496|5|LOVE IT!!!! great color and exactly what I expected :-)
B00519VRJI|5|I had a ghd before and it accidentally was broken. I bought this one as a replacement and am very pleased with it! I use it everyday and love that it is so light!
B00CFD8QRE|3|Allergic to it - I broke out.
B002XURD32|5|This little machine really gets the dead skin and debris off of your face.  It removes makeup you think is already gone.  It brings life to your skin tone.
B000V4813S|5|This creamy zinc based ointment is soft and creamy, clears up rashes quickly and is so pleasant to smell.  I actually like to put diaper cream on!
B003YJ6I78|5|I love this detangler/leave in conditioner. It smells like heaven and keeps my (and my two girls) hair soft. I even spray it in sometimes on dry hair. I Just spray on my hands and smooth through ends.
B00H594L1S|3|I didn't have a lot of success with this product, and the color is too dark for me, I have very blonde hair, but unfortunately it is the lightest they offer in the dip brow, if you have very light brows try the brow wiz
B00P4G3Y6M|5|Excellent  nail polish, by far one of my favorites. Works perfect and changes colors with temperature just as advertised. Love it
B001VEK1IU|5|Pretty good quality for your shave machine, I would advise to replace it once a year. I got it and then I felt my shave machine was like new.
B0010KDUA6|5|Great price for this product cost a lot more in the salons. I love this product. I've been using it for a long time. Shipping was fast!
B001EWEPDG|5|Keeps my hair healthy and shiny! Hardly anymore tangles or splint ends!<br />I do a treatment once a week and my hair has really shown signs of repairing and healing root to end!<br /><br />I have very straight hair but This has really smoothed my fly-aways and frizz!
B004LG0DQK|5|Works well.
B00SP4XYO2|5|I ordered &#34;Pink Sugar&#34;, I Love my product, fast delivery and I got an extra fragrance &#34;Cashmere&#34;, and it smells really great!
B003RW2K0G|5|Really like this product.  I have extremely curly hair and this stuff works great with it. Try it you'll like it.
B002N5MHLK|5|I have been shaving with a Norelco for 25 years and decided to give this one a try based on claims of a closer, more comfortable & longer-lasting shave. I just use a standard pre-shave lotion - nothing fancy. So far I am loving this shaver. It does a great job, is easy to clean, and gives me a much better all around shave than my Norelco, especially now after a month or so and my skin & beard are becoming accustomed to the foil-type shaver. This is a precision instrument. It runs quietly and after each shave I clean it with a little handsoap gel & warm water just like it says in the instuctions. No need to use the expensive cleaning cartridges that come with the charging unit. If you get one be sure to use the \\"FREE\\" position to allow the head to float as you shave and try it for at least a month to allow your skin & beard to get used to it.
B00BQUALCA|4|My wife wanted to try these out and she loves them.  Got them earlier than planned and they are a great quality!
B0037EX12U|2|Doesn't lubricate well. Too sticky.
B00KI0WIM0|5|Always Great
B004U5PXD0|1|This is not the real stuff. It is brown and looks old. It smells really funny too. I recommend buying it at the store where it is fresh.
B007N47C66|5|I really didn't believe this would work for my hard callused feet.  After putting it to work on my feet, I was amazed at how fast it worked and it was so easy!  No more painful efforts of using a Ped Egg or pumice stones that never worked after 15 minutes of grinding.
B001DPMETG|3|Still some puffiness.
B00021DPNG|4|I recieved this item with a kit I bought and have had no problems using it.  I use it with the Mineral Veil and it is great to have in my purse for touch ups.  It's no messier than the containers all B.E. makeup comes in.  The only issue I have is that I think it's a little pricey.  But otherwise I love it.
B009NNFB0O|1|Product was simply a waste of money. If you're looking for something to help soften your beard plz look else where.
B00C1NAPL8|1|I wish I could give this product zero stars! Don't waste your money. This product does not work at all!
B00267AETM|5|My skin is typically dry. This absorbs into my skin so well and moisturizes wonderfully. I use this as my face moisturizer. A little goes a long way. Two pumps is enough to cover my face and neck. The oil is also very light and not greasy. My skin soaks it right up. This is a great price as well as I've seen marula oil sold for upwards of $40.
B00DWGEY1K|5|A great quality product as advertised!
B00BR47Q7S|5|LOVE THE WAY IT HYDRATES YOUR HAIR LEAVES VERY SOFT
B002VAPHXW|5|Excellent
B00K6SQHI0|5|soft and smooth very nice product I'm very happy with this products took me a very long time before I found something that I was happy and impress with, and AMARA made me happy, thank you for this product I love them
B000WHNI2I|5|These specific heads formy sonicare are difficult to find in my area for under 26.00...this was a great buy and the seller preformed perfectly.
B00BX2RP6Q|5|Just the best!!!
B00467BCEG|5|This is a nice product but I ordered the wrong color.  I have ivory skin and this made me look like a ghost lol.  Next time I will order a darker color.
B002Q80FXG|4|So I have never tried wraps before but have 2 splits that are too far down to file that short and my regular gel isnt strong enough to support it without putting on twice as many coats and making the nail too thick. I am SUPER happy with this fiberglass! my nails are rock hard! I used IbD 5 second brush on gel resin over top, let it dry and went on with my usual gel routine. The fiberglass is completely concealed and you cant tell its even there, and SO thin and stong the nails dont look any different than my others! I am really happy with this!!!! The reason i gave it only 4 stars is the in the description says &#34;pre cut&#34; and they are not. ANd I discovered that &#34;2 count&#34; means 2 yards! So i have enough fiberglass to last me forever! It was a little tedious cutting them to the right shape and size, but I was only doing 2 nails so it wasnt too bad. I def like the self adhesive part, very helpful in getting it placed just right. I would recommend this to anyone! so easy and effective! just what i was looking for!!
B003DGK1ZC|5|Adoro 😍
B00AC9O8SO|5|MUCH TO MY DELIGHT THIS IS A WONDERFUL HAIR STICK. THANK YOU.
B001CT0AGC|5|Great value product. It came just as described and it was in a sealed box and package, no signs of anything wrong. Would buy again if needed.
B005Z4HMK2|5|This stuff is just simply amazing.
B005QDL1K4|5|Very happy
B001ET76AI|3|This product works and the effects on my taste buds are not an issue for me. I get very chapped lips when I use it which can lead to a cold sore for me though. I also experience a sore throat. I am surprised no one else has mentioned this side effect though that is probably why the probiotics become necessary -  to equalize the bacterial ecology in the mouth? It is however a solution (no pun intended lol) to the confidence destroying effects of chronic bad breath.
B00479FP4Q|3|Product was just as good as I expected, but the delivery time was longer than expected
B00H1M8R3C|5|The best nose studs I have found on here yet. Great
B004KMK6YY|5|Fun to use  Grandkids are so cute in them and it takes me back to my younger kid days!  Awesome to see again.
B002UUT450|5|I've been using this for awhile. The three pack is a good deal. Nice cooling feeling without being all greasy.
B00B4E06TQ|5|Love
B002KECVVA|1|i bought this product thinking that this would help whatever lip color i had on, last longer and make the color pop; this product was nothing like that. it was really thick and clay-like that it literally was breaking my lips. FYI: this product is not good for dried lips! when i tried out the product it did not fulfill any of the qualities it said it would accomplish and i've only used it about 2 times and hasn't been touched since.
B000EHNDD0|4|I've had this toothbrush at least five years. There has been no drop in function in that time, though the rubber power button has disintegrated partially. I have recently switched to a newer Sonicare model, because I prefer a smaller brush head fixture. I also don't like the way water accumulates and gets gross under the screw-on brush head.
B00858VMQ0|5|Looks fine on the counter without giving it a western look.  Husband likes the cup shape and design.  Polished just right, not too shiny or dull.  I would recommend this item.
B0009ET5K8|5|Burt's Bees is an incredibly moisturizing lip balm/shimmer/gloss!  Usually anything this moisturizing does not have the amount of color that this has.  My lips feel so good after wearing this all day, but it looks as good as lipstick!  It isn't sticky or smell bad like a lot of lip glosses, either.  It has no taste (no strawberry, for example).  I think I am one of the last holdouts to try Burt's Bees, but now I am a believer!  I highly recommend it.
B0057WJ2K0|3|Doesn't stay on long after application and the tip gets dull. Would not buy again. It is okay for the price.
B00MNMQKPC|4|Great brushes for cream/liquid products! I like using it to apply cream contour so I can get precise placement.Def worth the price
B00M1E5F1W|3|These are of a different design than the original  I got with the razor.  Needs getting used to and not sure if I really like them.
B0079QOBPI|2|It's ok.
B00K5L50J0|5|A++
B003OC1LH2|5|My dad has been wearing this stuff since the 1980's, it is his trademark scent, but they don't sell it in department stores anymore. Thank God amazon.com has everything. I was happy to save a few bucks by not having it in excessive packaging. It shipped quickly and arrived without a problem.
B00756HQNQ|4|I bought this for my mom. It is smooth and gentle. Works good. My mom uses it every week. However, it may lose its sharpness after 2 month uses. Anyway, going to buy another one.
B00DT4757A|5|This stuff smells fantastic and is so easy to use!  I love that it gives my skin a matte finish but I wish I could leave it on all day.  I used this too much when I first got it and I'm waiting on my skin to calm down - my error, not a reflection of the product.  After one use I noticed an incredible difference in my pores - they were cleaner and smaller - I think that's why I used it too much - it was very exciting to see a difference.  All the reviews are right - this stuff is amazing.
B003FBI9LS|4|This waver is great. I love the waves it creates, it looks really beachy and fun. The only things I dislike about it is the heating situation. I like being able to see the actual temperature, not just a spinny thing going from hot to cool. Since I am afraid I am going too hot and burning my hair, I keep it on the cooler side, so it takes forever to wave. But I still really like it. If you have got time, get it! The price is a plus, too. As for it lasting, I can't say anything because I have only had it a few weeks...but so far, so good.
B00AQ9S93A|1|A must buy if you want to lose half your lashes within a month of wearing this! Also, if you want your mascara to crumble onto your cheeks by midday, this is the mascara for you!
B000MUDIZ2|5|This pillow helps me with my migraines since my migraines come from muscle tension from my neck b/c I work on a PC a lot with the same posture. Once I feel tension in my neck area, I just warm this pillow up and put it around my neck. After a while, the tension is gone. I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond.
B000J41AH4|5|It is grape seed oil. I works for my hair and skin.
B000052Y8Z|5|I lost a filling just before the weekend and knew I would have to wait till the following Monday to call the dentist. Saturday morning I woke up in a lot of pain. I was taking 800 mg of Ibuprofen and 1500 mg of Tylenol every 8 hours and 4 hours, respectively. At first it kept things under control... until I tried to eat and drink. It didn't matter how careful I was, once the pain started there was no going back. My whole jaw on that side, my cheekbone, my ear...it was too much. I called the number for the 24 hr nurse on my health card for any advice. The upshot was that I should try the dentemp (and get a script from my primary in case of infection). My husband picked up the dentemp and I went on-line to read the reviews. I was quite disheartened and if I had seen these beforehand I probably wouldn't have used it.  When I got the dentemp I made a small ball of it between my fingers (think silly putty) and stuck it in the hole, pressed and then bit down. Within two minutes the pain was GONE! I could feel where it had hurt and was grateful. In a little while I couldn't even feel that little remnant of pain. Thre was no numbness in any of the surrounding areas, the pain simply did not exist!   I was able to eat and drink all the things I normally eat and drink over the rest of the weekend, albeit, carefully. When I finally got to the dentist on Monday, I was still very comfortable (as though I had no issues at all!) When she saw the hole in my tooth, she exclaimed on the level of pain this must have produced. I don't think I would have managed with my sanity intact if it weren't for dentemp.
B0056BR5K6|5|We purchased these for wedding favors at our Beach wedding. GREAT size and GREAT product! Would purchase thes over and over!!
B00112BUBO|5|the blush is natural pink not to much just right, i use cover girl very easy to apply very easy to open great price if you are looking for a new blush i would give this one a try.. You wont be disappointed
B005Y1B9ZK|5|I love this serum, and this small, affordable bottle of it is cool cause I can't bring myself to drop $55 or $78 on a larger bottle. Someone's review said it was a rip off because it's so small, but if you do the math compared to the larger bottle, you can see it's actually not overpriced. And as far as the quality: I have sensitive and somewhat oily skin, and this doesn't irritate me or make me oilier. Even around my eyes, it's gentle. I've seen a noticeable difference in my skin tone (brightness) since I started using it. A+ \\"OOO-lah\\"!
B004Y9AINC|5|Works like it was advertised.  Am  completely satisfied.  I would recommend this item for anyone that requires tartar control.  Good luck.
B001E6TUYG|5|I wasn't sure if I'd like this shave lotion since I usually use a more traditional shave cream.  Since I've been trying to use more natural products, though, and since this had great reviews, I thought I'd give it a try.  I really like it!<br /><br />The pump dispenses just the right amount of product, and, while it doesn't foam up like a shave cream, it creates a lotion-like feel that makes your razor glide right over it.  It leaves my skin feeling silky soft, with no razor burn.<br /><br />The scent is also really light and nice; it doesn't stick around, so I've had no problems with it interfering with my perfume.<br /><br />I really like this, and am happy I gave it a try!
B006UEUGWM|4|I like this stain, fast shipping, and excited to keep using it. It does have an odd smell but not in a bad way. I think it's just from the stain.
B00JQVIVPK|5|Good article, happy with my purchase and happy with the seller because the package I get perfect and good time!
B001KYVNLU|5|Awesome colour!! Sober & subtle. Just right for everyday use. The colour stays for long, doesn't get cakey.<br />To avoid drying of my lips I used this lip colour over my chapstick. And yes , they stay.<br />Just love these endless collection..
B000S8JB68|5|Best curler i ever owned. Id suggest to wear the thermal glove it comes with it i burned myself a few times.
B0043OYFKU|2|My dermatologist said it is too rough to use and really isn't that good.
B007PV2JV0|5|Great product!
B00EURT25S|3|strong sulfur smell even after you rinse, but definitely helps skin ailments
B0040II78K|5|So far so good. I had to research on what products would be good for hair that had been chemically damaged due to using a new perm which caused a lot of my hair to come out and left the rest of my hair bone dry and brittle. This shampoo and conditioner set came up so I decided to give it a try. I've been using this for about 3 months now and it has helped give strength back to my hair. I think I will use Nexxus products from now on to help maintain moisture and strength in my hair. I waited a while to write a review because you never know how some products will turn out after a few uses, so I wanted to be certain before I wrote anything.
B001TZLPXQ|5|A really great product my daughter has visual processing issues so having her school work raised really helps her in the class
B00FZKB51S|5|OMG these are fantastic.  Just bought as a stocking stuffer for myself and ended up with best product ever!
B00622KB7W|1|This product was not as expected.  It was thin and did not show the results of the original. Not sure I would buy again.
B00F4YS108|4|Pretty good, got it within 7 days but that smell is killing me!
B001AJ6QNA|5|I used Norelco before and I loved it. This product is better than Remington, but the head is expensive. I hope the price will be reduced in the future .
B003N4XLH4|5|Bar lasts a long time.  No Smell and gentle on our skin.  Nice soap to use in the shower.  Will be purchasing again.
B001QKHT34|5|The Trophy Skin Light delivers on it's promise.  Although, it has not been able to completely rid me of acne, I can say that it does help control my acne without the expensive costs of going to a dermatologist twice a week. I did notice extra dryness in my skin the day after but with moisturizer it appears normal again.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has tried topical and oral remedies to clear up their skin without resolve or satisfaction.
B00A4F86KC|3|When I bought this I knew that it would be glittery!!! But it was to glittery! Other than that it smells great and I love that it is Vegan!!!
B009ND81NS|4|I rarely use the pads it comes with though, I've used one pad for 2 weeks every 4 days (4 times) and I don't use them cuz of the chemicals in them which are bad. Instead I've been making my own sugar mask with honey and green tea and the results are decent. I use this for mild acne scars
B0081YI8QK|5|Arrived in 2 days!<br /><br />I had previously used the 1.5mm  and decided to try the 2.0.<br />Due to reviews and videos I had watched, I was a little intimidated, I expected to bleed, and I expected pain (I don't use a numbing cream.)  The pain during it was minimal, (no worse than the 1.5mm which doesnt really bother me)  After the fact, there is that &#34;sunburned tingle&#34;  I had NO BLEEDING.  not sure what to make of that, as even the esthetician on youtube who had been doing this for 20+ years had bleeding.  But Im not complaining.<br /><br />Great seller, Great product.
B001GIOV7S|3|I do love Burt's lip balms and lip shimmers, and based on favorable reviews of this Day Lotion, I have decided to give it a try.<br />The verdict is - I like the it OK, but am not completely thrilled with it.<br /><br />I have somewhat dry skin, and just putting this moisturizer on by itself does not seem to do the job.  It does absorb very quickly, but then leaves the skin feeling just as dry. stretched and sallow, as it was before.<br />What I found out helps a bit was mixing it with some additional oil (argan, avocado or coconut) to improve the moisturizing quality of it.<br />It seemed to have helped, but I do not believe I will be buying this again.
B003ZW2EP4|5|Great for Keratin treated hair, has no sulfates..works beautifully.  I haven’t found one better.<br />Nothing in it is artifical, hair feels healthier.
B002UYBDD2|5|More like a cream than a powder, I apply it with a brush and then brush up through my eyebrows.  It seems to work very well.
B0013V8692|5|I love this hair dye, wish it was sold in stores again. I get alot of compliments when I use this product.
B000QST110|5|An elegant perfume, it smells very expensive, but is a great value. I first purchased this perfume on a trip in Italy. Several of the other women on the trip purchased it after they smelled the fragrance at dinner that night. Soft and very fresh, if you like the smell of honeysuckle you will love this Perfume. My husband likes it, not to strong, just a gentle hint of honeysuckle. Highly Recommended to everyone. The other Perfumes made by L'Erbolario including Lily of the Valley are very nice but this is my favorite. When I wear it I get lots of compliments, for example, \\"Your perfume smells so wonderful, could you tell me the name of it.\\" I have given several as a gift and each person loves it. Jo
B00X65S05I|5|Wonderful  works exactly as stated and definitely made my hair noticeably thicker
B003TQTFVW|5|Small and folds!!! Blows super powerful to dry the long hair that reaches to the bottom of my back. Sometimes it switches from super powerful to regular on its own but for the price it is well worth the ADD on for only $9. Awesome for a travel blow dryer.
B006PKVCPQ|3|Really hard on your hair
B005GQ6HUK|4|I started using this stuff instead of gel or other hair products.  I put it in after a shower and comb.  Hair stays in place all day; and, it's good for your hair.
B000068PBT|5|Making the purchase of the razor replacement heads on line at Amazon was a major convenience.  The heads were extremely easy to install and the razor is working like new again.
B00H302QDE|5|It is the best out there, and this was a great deal for the 2, I equated vs the one and costs and good price.  I have also checked around and done hours of research to confirm this is the best out there, now I shall be wearing more eyeshadow.
B009YLQR4Y|5|Easy and ready to use. Great for traveling! No mess, wax is not water soluble, doesn't really leave much residue, came off easy with oil (I used azura oil) oh, and they smell great!
B004EIVYM2|5|I am still waiting to wake up from the lovely dream of finally having something to control the eczema on my eyelids..... Not an extreme case by no means and especially compared to what I've seen, but so irritating to have and have had it for about 6 mths now and also on and around my lips.........spend 3/4 days clearing it up with the typical H2 and other products purchased from the drugstore and then enjoy 3/4 days of clearing and then do it all over again...........was making me crazy!!!  So what I wish especially is to remember the girls blog that I came across that recommended this .......... I just cannot thank her enough for sharing her story.... and cannot recommend this product enough.......HAPPYHOLLY!:)
B002OEBYZU|5|Bought these on a whim and wound up giving them as gifts they are super absorbant and so easy to care for.
B003VDBQE2|4|I like the Nivea brand name and when I saw this I thought I would give it a try.  I actually liked it a lot,  it gave a nice clean,  didn't leave my skin shiny or dry,  but rather velvety and soft.  It didn't irritate my sensitive skin or eyes and it smelt fine (not chemical or too flowery) It should cost around $7/$8.
B0000A1WGK|1|I have purchased 2 of these and my first one stopped heating a few days after i bought it. Im not sure why or how, but i thought that it was just  a defect in that one straightener. The second conair straightener i bought heated well for the first few months, but then started shutting down while i was in the middle of straightening my hair. It would randomly turn itself off. Also, when the straightener does heat, it is not nearly hot enough.
B00IIT430S|5|Wife loves this product, was introduced to it at a hotel near Yosemite.  Only wish we could get it in larger containers, but the small one are okay and great for weekend traveling.
B006IS4FD6|5|Great
B00CRXUO68|5|Love this mascara
B000V2ACH8|5|Best of the bunch, I bought most of the Gatsby products but I like my hair pretty short, Asian hair, this stuff is the best of the lot for me.  Distributes nice and evenly due to consistency.
B001E7688Q|1|I purchased this product and was thrilled for a few days..  then I broke out really bad! I used this product for 1 week and in the garbage it went.  I experienced quite a bit of stinging (which I thought was normal at first) but it would actually irritate my zits and make them worse.   I'm in my late 20's with severe environmental allergies. I have dry, sensitive skin and cannot use scrubs as they make me break out. I thought this was a good alternative but, it seems this product is waaaayyyy to irritating and drying for my skin.
B004SQNG9Y|5|this is not only a wonderful color but goes on smoothly and stays well for the most part. my only issue is that you have to build up several layer to get it to be the right color, also it accentuates if your lips are cracked or dry, so i would take care of that before putting it on.  all in all i love this lipstick i originally bought it for a poison ivy costume but i wear it out all the time too.
B008ORZ81W|5|I been using this product for only a couple of months now and my skin is clear on my face... I had big bumps on my face before using this soap, now since I been using this product I haven't had one big bump jump on my yet!! Little one still come but they leave in a couple of days! I recommend this to people with oily skin its perfect!!
B002EP9OUG|3|This kit came in handy for me to do my waxes at home, its too expensive running to the salon every two weeks to get my body waxed, this works perfect.
B000TTHFFU|3|It's okay, not quite like the last container I bought from Ulta, so i have to wonder....  It was however the larger size, and not the tiny size many are discussing in reviews.
B004C6QP3Y|5|These work perfectly with my Sonicare toothbrush and came at an excellent price. The generic Sonicare heads from Wal-Mart (Equate brand) are very low quality, make a racket while the toothbrush is on and don't work as well. These brush heads are noticeably better than the generics. Can't complain!
B001E722M2|1|I agree with all the other reviewers who loved the old version. I'd been using this product for about 15 years because NOTHING on the market was anywhere near as good. Why did they mess with perfection?
B0039VOSPU|5|After reading all of mixed reviews on this scent, I was skeptical on buying it, but I must say that this perfume is sure to seduce. I love the way it smells against my skin. The scent rises to my nose throughout the day. It isn't overwhelming at all. It lingers as you walk out the room. I would definitely purchase this perfume again. Also, I read some reviews that the item was a knock off. I disagree. It is an official perfume for a great price.
B00WX2DXQQ|5|Great serum. I used to use prescription vitamin A cream several years ago. Worked great, however it was harsh sometime (a lot of dryness and peeling). I have been using this serum for a few weeks now, and I can tell that it has the same effect without the side effects. I use it on the clean face sometime by itself and sometime with moisturizer.  I am glad I came cross this product on Amazon.
B00FH692PQ|5|Very fast shipping. Love the way this product makes my hair feel.
B0028R0WFG|5|wonderful
B00D9NV2D4|5|Good product and a lot of helpful information. Thanks!
B000EPJNMW|4|I have bought a similar set 6-7 years ago in Sweden and I have been more that content. That the reason why I bought two new sets from you. It is as exellent as my first set exept for one thing. The majority of the pins,- mainly the ones with red tops- glides of the curlers causing them to fall off. I have had help from a friend that narrowed the middel parts of the pins and now they are exellent. I suggest though that you alter the pins a bit, so they woun´t glide. All in all I am happy with my sets. .
B0000530EZ|5|I use this Aussie product in my daughters hair. It really has been working well. She has dry hair so I spray this in her hair daily.
B007ZR2SNS|4|Essie has great polish but i thought this was more chrome looking than it actually is.<br />Check out my nail art slide show<br />[...]
B00OYJW0I8|5|Perfect!!!!
B00BF27PGY|5|I tried this perfume at Macy's before buying it, and I was immediately amazed at how subtle the scent is.  I don't like strong perfumes, and it seems like most celebrity fragrances are strong enough to knock you down -- but this one is very light and not overpowering.  You have to be very close to smell it.  On me, the strongest notes are vanilla and sandalwood.<br /><br />While this perfume smells amazing on me, it's important to note that individual skin chemistry has a powerful effect on how a perfume smells, so it's a good idea to try it on (and leave it on for a few hours) before making a decision on whether or not you like it.
B000NBQUNW|5|They recommend 2 chews a day to help with the cholesterol.  My problem is only eating 2!  These are a great help with both my cholesterol and my diet.  I'm glad I found them.
B007VE0G2U|2|The mirror is actually only 6\\" in diameter not 7\\" as the write-up states. The difference is the 7\\" includes the light around the outer border. With 10X magnification you can really see your face like never before, but you only get to see a relatively small section at a time. If you are going with 10X magnification I'd suggest getting a larger mirror. The other issue I have with this mirror is the light is a harsh white.
B007TFKDBK|5|The obagi clenziderm dual pack when used on a regular basis morning and night will work fabulously for stubborn acne. I have tried everything for my teen age son including chemical peels for his acne and this stuff works great.
B008QUOE1M|4|Guys like to look good, too, so I tried this combo and it works great.  The abrasive (but not too rough), pore scrub gets rid of dirt that regular soap can't, cleans way down deep and leaves my skin feeling very clean.  Then I put the cream on my frown lines and underneath my eyes.  I've been using a combo like this (including this one), for years, and everybody tells me I look great (I'm going to be 60 next year), and it's good to hear from others that I don't look (or act) as &#34;old&#34; as I am!
B006GQYSGO|3|For the price, it's OK, but doesn't shave as closely as would like, has no popup sideburn trimmer, but is a good secondary shaver.
B001BOFISS|2|I purchased this product in September.  When I got it I was so dissapointed to find out how loud and heavy this thing was.  This thing is so loud that I have been asked by a family member to find somewhere else to blowdry my hair because it wakes them up in the next room over (and trust me, they are not light sleepers)!  After a few weeks of use, the dryer cut out while I was half way done drying my hair and would not turn back on for roughly 10 minutes.  I thought perhaps it was a fluke thing.  Nope!  Just over another month passed and the dryer began to spark from the inside and was glowing for about 2 minutes, when all of a sudden it stoped glowing and would not blow any hot air.  This dryer overheats like nothing I have ever seen.  This thing is awful.  I am so dissapointed because the last hairdryer I owned was an Andis as well and it was amazing! It lasted me just over 5 years, was super quiet, lightweight and wonderful.  Do not buy this item!
B0006FMKB6|5|I switched from Aveeno's bath oil to Robathol when I realized that Aveeno's version has a fragrance and my doctor ordered me to go fragrance-free. The oil works great. No scent. Do need to be careful getting out of the tub as it makes things slippery. It's not as think as Aveeno's bath oil but works just as well, if not better.
B002WJOOIQ|5|This stuff works amazing.
B00544M11I|3|TOO DARK FOR ME. I GAVE IT AWAY.
B002LDB47C|3|Color is not as dark as you'd think it would be looking at the bottle (good or bad, depending on what you want). I think it is a pretty shade though. Faint color might be a problem if you want darker color though, since wiggly munchkins don't always want to stand still for multiple coats.<br /><br />It's also slow - drying (which I've found to be typical in the less toxic nail polishes.. It's the drying/hardening chemicals that are usually toxic). So for wiggly little toddler, i usually only do one hand at a time, and do the second hand later. I sometimes use a quick blow dryer blast or two to help, but not always a great idea in dryer weather when hands getting dried out alteady.
B00QAB9R5C|5|Yes excelent product
B00132O442|5|Just finished using this product for the first time upon a recommendation from my naturopath as a fix for my moderate acne. OMG, my 40+ skin looks 20. I love this product.
B00336EUTK|5|Arrived promptly.  Teeth looks great.
B000HLH79E|1|Didn't work.
B002DDZFZM|1|aside from the fact that I received a different product all together, the quality was miserable. this guy is buying them for no more than a handful of uncooked rice in convinced. dont waste your time its cheap as it gets. mine lasted a week before the actual loop on it ripped, not even the stitching, but the actual material used to make the belt loop..... I'm done
B004QM0OJ0|3|Don&#34;t waste your money purchase a similiar product @ a drug store. I purchased these they were similar to tic tacs,
B006C8BKRG|4|Again Amazon beats retail price and the convenience. If only Amazon did not abuse its workers.  I will learn one day.
B00KNCUMDU|5|Love it, love it.  I use a color very similar by Tom Ford that costs $45.00.  MAC's color is prettier and less expensive.  It last and what can I say, I LOVE IT!!!
B00QSDWCC2|5|Worked real real good, got curls and twist in my hair everyday with no effort needed, real talk this jjaint the truth yo!
B0009RAX4W|5|OK so i am naturally very very pale like a ghost ! for the past 3 years iv been self tanning with the self tanners from like CVS and WALMART and i was never happy with the results because they were always streaky and took 8 hours to develope color and never seemed to dry. The color was never even. I was trying to find something that had good reviews and that people seemed to like so i found out about Salon Bronze Airbrush Tanning System and i thought well its worth a try. So i tried it and i was AMAZED by the results ! The color develops in minutes! and lasts up to almost a week. But when you first spray it on, it really look blotchy and cheap, but if you give it a minute or two, it will spread out and even out on its own! I am so happy i found this product and i will be using it for now on. For only 12.99$ for the airbrush sprayer and 9$ for each refill is such a great price for the AMAZING RESULTS!!!!!!!!!!
B000C1W2DK|4|Excelente producto, cumple totalmente con el requerimiento, escelente entrega, buen negocio, muy agradecido.  Llego en buen estado y perfectas condiciones
B000E7UDOM|5|I tried a bunch of expensive perfumes (one of those perfume stores) not a big perfume person, and this was the only one I liked. I love light, fresh, sweet perfumes but for parties or going out, you can need something a little more -<br />this hit the spot.<br />(haven't tried any other valentino perfumes but I will just because)<br />I don't like smelling chemically. This one doesn't. (Haven't had a lot of luck with blends on my skin)
B00D3PV0F8|5|Arrived early, packaged well .. Great smell and will reorder
B00F67I2VG|4|This was exactly what I was looking for  - it's sparkly and comfortable and just the &#34;right amount of bling&#34;.  Gave it 4 stars due to price and it came later than expected but it was worth the wait.  I wear this almost every day and get many many compliments.
B0049ZPEH6|1|Its ok but when I opened it it was not what I wanted (#8) and I havent used it n cant return it cause I opend it
B00CMWIUTM|5|Love this scent!
B002RS6JZ8|5|How many cans for the $50.79?
B0035RKOOW|5|I do not know how I can live without this bag. I totally love this bag since I do bridal hair and makeup.<br />I love that I don't have to pack and unpack anymore. So no more bulky luggage. I only bring the essentials<br />and it fits everything that I need. It also has specific slots for brushes which you can not see in the picture<br />that they have posted. So that was a nice surprise. It is also very durable. For the price, this is totally<br />worth the money! I'm telling all my hairdresser friends about this bag.
B000142MGA|5|Best we have purchased so far, and worth the extra price. Would recommend to friends and family. Nice and firm, Good for make-up and cleaning my guns.
B001H33ZRE|2|The gel is either old to just too dry...difficult to use and hard on eye lids.  Needs to be more like cream.  I have to use hypoallergic stuff...so, not happy with it.
B000RNJ1Z0|5|My husband has been using this cologne since it first came out, about 20 years ago. It is hard to find but worth it. It has leathery, smoky nuances-very masculine.
B00AEINQ9K|5|great for any type of hair. works perfect and gives a close shave look. the price and size of this thing are unbeatable. over all very satisfied with order and would recommend to others looking for  a great electric razor for a cheap price
B00QWCUT7E|5|I am somewhat new to toners with my skincare and never knew how essential they really are for your skincare! I use this right after I cleanse my face and I absolutely love it! It has vitamin C in it so it has an orange like smell to it. It is refreshing and light and I love it! It doesnt make your face sticky at all. It cleared up the acne I had on my forehead in days.I also like the packaging and how it has a stopper so a bunch of the product doesnt spill everywhere. Its so much better than the open bottles that some toners have. You get a lot more product with this toner than most other toners as well. I am really impressed with this toner. I have their eye cream too and its amazing as well! I love this company and the products they make! Highly recommend!!
B00DQGZFB4|5|Works great! Will buy one for all my girls for a stocking stuffer! Price is great. 2 week delivery
B004H8MMSO|1|I recommend not to buy this product because they give you either doubles of the same plate, or the wrong plates in general!! They gave me 21 but most of them were not the ones pictured, i had doubles, and i got ones that i didn't want. i was so mad that i haven't even tested them out to see how they work
B0017RC42W|5|Works fine on the bottom layer of my hair without any grabbing or pulling on my hair.
B00O2EX4A8|5|very good shampoo plus conditoner.
B00181OKDI|5|I have been using the Lavender Cleansing Conditioner for about a year and it is the best. I am of mixed race and it really tames my very curly hair.
B00NY874KY|5|Awesome
B00HFXW440|5|super easy if you have short hair to put this around and make a nothing bun look cute!
B00VYL2B74|5|First of all, they arrived when the seller said! Second, they came with certain smell, so wash them! The water and soap removed it perfectly! Third, the fabric is great for the price! Finally, i have only one complaint! Two of them came with the handle loose, I've been using them for 1month and they've not broken! I really recommend them! They do their job nicely! They're soft but at the same time firm!
B00J2EJKVU|5|I bought this product in a drugstore some time ago. I didn't see it there anymore, but it was on Amazon. Not much is needed to use as a hair set while using curlers--yes, I use curlers. It saves many trips to the hairdresser, and it dries quickly.
B00065IBKK|1|I ordered these and when I opened the box there was someone else's hair in the comb! Gross!
B000C1Z6KG|1|the only thing good is the apparience. i dont like the smell its horrible. total dissapoint
B00CNYHT82|5|Love them I am a hairdresser and I bought these for weddings and prom Doo's. They are just what I wanted and at a reasonable price
B000BJ1CGQ|4|I really love my waxer. The only bad thing is that the lid was cracked on delivery. Amazon reimbursed me for that. Other than that it's great!
B00005A9WP|5|Nice system for a great price!  I use this to steam my sinuses and it works great!!!  It was shipped very fast.  A side benefit of steaming my sinuses is that it has made my skin really soft.  Very good product for anybody to buy!
B00NWTUFVA|4|I do like the EOS, but I like the Blistex lip conditioning better it glides on much easier and my lips indeed are supple, the EOS product really pulls on my lips during application.  I will go back to Blistex once these 10 are gone.
B003XDQ77G|4|I like this toothpaste. Especially when I couple it with my whitening booster I notice better results than using any other toothpaste brand alone.
B00770JW9Q|4|I was hoping for the high gloss finish to last a couple of days, but, it does get dull just like any other top coat.  It does provide nice coverage when applying with the brush - smooth finish.
B00HBSC3JA|5|Working with my first beard, and this shampoo has made it so much more manageable.
B00MWW74FS|5|Works very well,  should have bought years ago!
B00BIL9HZE|5|Helps shave cleanly. I love the feel of this on my skin. Keeps the shaved area smooth.
B0007Z630E|5|I have the natural African-American hair; imagine the kinkiest, curliest hair possible. Lately, I've been trying to straighten my hair but it either doesn't get straight or poof back up in a few hours. A friend recommended that I use Sabino Moisture Block as an anti-humidity serum and I bought it off Amazon the same day. When I received the Sabino, I washed and conditioned my hair with herbal essesnces hello hydration shampoo and conditioner. Then I sectioned my hair into 6 section and applied the a dime-size amount of the serum to each section from root to end. I blew out my hair with a brush and flat ironed, and I had beautifully silky hair. My hair has lasted a whole week and only puffed up at the roots in the middle of my had on day 5, but I can still wear it in a high ponytail. I will never be without this serum again, its WAAAY bettter than the John Frieda crap I was using.
B00AWR9NR2|1|Awful product. Didn't work at all. Disappointed
B0088XCUUO|5|I was surprised at the quality of this piece.  Very well done.  I wear it with a blue evil eye that I have that is actually made of real gemstones and cost much more than the hamsa.  They look beautiful together and I can't tell the difference between the pieces.  Don't undertand the negative reviews.  For the price, this hamsa looks and feels much more expensive.  I love it.
B00132ZG3U|5|I usually do not like to buy something like this online but I am very pleased with this blow dryer.  It is very light (compared to my old one) and very quiet.  I have very thick, wavy hair and it dries it quickly.  My only con on this blow dryer is the cord is short compared to the extra long cord on my previous blow dryer but I think the lighter weight and quieter motor make up for this.  Good price and a good blow dryer.
B003ES7GRA|1|Product received was not genuine, therefore could not be used.  Be sure to register with manufacturer to ensure authenticity.
B00CN0V8JW|5|The best acne product in the world
B001J6O0JG|5|I've been using the electric razor 2 yrs now.  Wonderful product for shaving especially if you're a bald guy.  Thank you.
B009WQH8SA|4|As a recent convert to the DE shaving systems, I'm trying all sorts of blades, balms, soaps, and creams.  While I like my Shave Secret oil, I am quite impressed with this product.  For those who don't like it because it doesn't &#34;lather&#34; read the directions.  It tells you it won't and isn't a foam product.  Doh!  While it does say &#34;light lather&#34; I've used enough to know that means it won't be like a can of Barbasol or Edge Gel foam.<br /><br />The scent is nice and when paired with my personna razor blades, my DE razor performed very, very nice.<br /><br />I did have to keep re-wetting my face to keep the slick factor going...hence the 1 star dock for that.<br /><br />Other than that, if you like this stuff, your local WallWorld carries it for $5.97 which is a very good deal considering I will try the next shave with less than the almond size amount they say to start with.  $5.97 could last you a very long time.
B008PFG9F2|4|love this line! it has sea kelp to strengthen and purify the skin as well as dipalmitoyl hydroxyproline which firms and plumps the skin. will buy full size products now!
B00CQKWTP6|5|I loved this and enjoy knowing I'm using organic products.
B00OP273HW|1|I recieved this product curtesy of Buzzagent to review. The 2 in 1 was less than satisfactory. The shampoo/conditioneer is for &#34;textured&#34; hair. This product left  my curls feelings dry and less then conditioned. I would not recommend it.
B004CN8XZU|5|This does not hold alot of towels at once but i had a bigger one and felt it was far to bulky anyways, it is very nice!
B00QT14EB0|4|Kind of expensive but works goo lower the price ad I'll give it 5 stars!
B000C1Z6VA|5|This fragrance is really hard to find, but is definately a \\"MUST HAVE!\\" If you like  smelling like a bouquet of roses this scent is for you!!!!!
B0015NKY1Q|5|Wow, I found this foot cream in a little shop while vacationing.  My only regret was not knowing about it sooner so I could have gotten a better deal on the price through amazon.  That being said, this lotion is not tested on animals, it is made of natural extracts and there are no chemicals or preservatives in the lotion.  It is a nice, thick lotion and it is almost as nice giving a foot rub as getting it as your hands are nicely moisturized and smell great.  A great mix of mint and sweet which kind of reminded me of chocolate candy cane bark.....it leaves your feet, legs (and hands) nicely moisturized.  Would I recommend?  Absolutely!  Buy again?  Yep, and I would seek out more of the Deep Steep line.  Great product!
B00DMB5JAK|2|Travel Sized,,,  Smeels Great like Berry Kisses but with a cool calm blue floral smell,,,  Puts me in a mind of a lite Baby Powder & shower Fresh Deorant, So Disappointed in my Self not checking the ounce on my One Click Amazon Purchase,,,  Super Tiny,,,  Must be a High demand or discontinued sent for the travel size to be this price, This one will last me for 2 weeks Max super tiny LOL My Fault,,
B008E8B02W|3|The steamer works great. The light bulb was broken when I got it and I had to order a new one because I didn't have time to send it back.
B005P0WQHA|3|I had such high hopes cause I love the shaving cream - this isn't as good
B00M4G3MZ8|5|Great item!
B006HJRQ1O|4|Bought this color from opi gel brand because gellish didn't offer this color. The color is very pretty with pearl specks/glitter... I used my gellish base and top coat. The polish has a more watery consistency than gellish, but still went on fine. I'm going on a week with the polish on and still no chips or scratches. I like it and would buy more colors in the future.
B0036WTV2C|5|This nightguard was easy to mold and they fit very well. My teeth felt weird the first couple nights but I think it was just a matter of getting used to it. It works well to protect my teeth when I grind at night.
B004DK8WA8|5|I've been using the Neutrogena oil free acne soap ([[ASIN:B000FH4I1U Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash, 6 Ounce]]) for years and have been very pleased with it. I gave this a try as well since it has the same active ingredient (2% salicylic acid). So far, it's been great.<br /><br />The scent is much nicer than the regular version. Not that the regular version smells bad, but rather instead of a \\"soapy\\" smell, this has a lighter and more refreshing scent.<br /><br />As with the regular version it's very thick, so just a little is all that is needed. A bottle lasts for some time, making it a better value for me than the store-brand versions, which tend to be much thinner and require more per use.<br /><br />I only use it at most once per day, and often skip a day since the salicylic acid can cause skin redness and irritation. If you've never used it before start off slowly to make sure you don't have a sensitivity to salicylic acid.<br /><br />I can't say that I notice any difference in the effectiveness of this versus the regular version even though this says it has \\"microclean\\" technology. But it's a nice change of pace and scent.
B0011DMMM4|5|Well this stuff I fell in live with great to soak and relax in after an intense workout, be prepare to sleep a while
B0036FTF16|5|My favorite perfume. Great service, prices and fast delivery.
B000VXUTFW|5|This product smells great and work very well. It has a natural hold and does not make my hair look greasy. People expecting more hold should understand that a cream behaves differently than a gel and serve different purposes.
B007PCR9UK|5|I got this top coat in the Tinsel Town Collection (which I'm loving), and it's my favorite polish of the bunch. It's a fine hologram glitter, similar to nails inc Electric Lane, but with some sparklier bits in it. Easy to apply, and cheers up any color!
B0027EZF7K|4|it gives fair coverage, but does not completely conceal the blue under my eyes. I was hoping for more coverage since it is listed as full. Does not make my face look yellow.
B008HP2VRU|5|If you are looking for the best (like-your-natural-lip) lip color, \\"Honey\\" is the one for you.  I am Asian but I am sure this color will go for any skin color out there.  It comes on like a maroon color in the beginning but after one application and waiting out for half a minute to one minute and applying the second coat, you should be set for hours on.  It actually looks better as the color starts to set on the lips.  It's perfect for going out everyday to going to work or party because it seems pretty natural.  It makes your lips have that pop of color but not too much.  The balm smells minty like menthol so don't worry about a waxy, lipstick smell.  After exfoliating and all, the product should glide on the lips smoothly.  For an 8-10 hour day, I would say it's necessary to reapply like one more time midday, unlike most others that cause splotchy fading, requiring for constant reapplication, which can be so annoying.
B00CD0IMBO|1|Hi, I´m really mad because I ordered the wnad that I saw in the picture but you delivered another, that one is very different, is BLACK I wanted pink, it has another pieces.<br />Really mad.
B00FG0AR0W|5|Very cute and great way to show support this month..October.
B007VINJQG|5|It's a christmas gift for my sister who is a teacher and i cant wait to give it to her
B00G4R1LVA|1|I was planning to use these for cosmetics, removing makeup and such. No such luck, however, these are tiny! If you want to make a sheep arts and crafts project with your kid, these are just the cotton balls for you. If you want to use them for personal use, skip them and purchase a bag from the store so you can see what you're getting.
B0031TSBCQ|1|I have fine, combination hair - oily at the roots and dry at the ends with a sensitive scalp (prone to flaking/itching) ...I had high hopes for this shampoo considering it's for 'combination' hair type.  But this shampoo has been a huge disappointment.  My hair really dried out and started falling each time I washed my hair with this shampoo.  My scalp got irritated and itchy.  Plus this shampoo is ridiculously EXPENSIVE.
B0092MCMM6|4|Nice dryer. Love the color and style. Works nice and distributes the heat pretty evenly; however there were issues in trying to adjust the hood as it kept wanted to fold down in the close position while I was trying to lower it to sit closer to my head. .
B003690SF4|1|There's nothing moisturizing about this lotion. It goes on like a lotion, but then it dries and it makes your face have dry red scaly patches all over. I used this twice, no more. It's horrible. I also hate the smell, it smells like roses, I hate that smell.
B003DRDHG6|5|excellent
B0012IN8Q2|4|Good
B001SB9CL8|4|Proactiv solution is the only acne solution that has worked for me. As cliche as it sounds, I have tried almost everything on the market and nothing has worked as well.  The only downside is that it takes a couple weeks to see a huge difference but when it starts working, it really works.  Not only does it clear up acne, but it prevents it as well.
B00ISF9XQ6|4|good garlic oil
B0059NA3MI|5|This stuff is seriously awesome. This is the first BB Cream or foundation I've used that hasn't dried out my (ridiculously dry, sensitive) skin. I also have eczema and some foundations that have sunscreen actually sting my face when my skin is bad. Not this one though! The formula is thin but goes a long way and provides good coverage. I can apply it well with my fingers or blend it with a blush brush. I'm Asian so it blended into my skin tone well but it might not for those with medium/darker skin tones. It will make your face look super flat so I recommend using blush and/or a contouring powder on top to add shape back to your face. I set the look with e.l.f. High Definition Loose Powder so it stays on longer. I'll definitely buy another when I run out!
B000SDY1NQ|2|took a while and was not exactly what I was expecting
B00518N5SK|4|I LOVE the lip color. I love the feel of it and it's just gorgeous! Orange but also a little salmon at a certain angle because of the sparkle (Idk if that's the right description but it's pretty!)<br />The reason I rated it 4 stars is because the moment I tried to apply it, the tip fell off :( The pencil can be sharpened, but it still bums me out a bit.<br /><br />But as for the product itself, I'm so happy I purchased. It has a tacky feel, but it's not unbearable. That's what helps it last longer :) Definitely recommend! (just don't use it right away. I think it kinda melted in my mail box.. haha..)
B00KA8O63E|3|I thought cheaper brands were better.  The smell is very bad
B006UET4XE|5|My favorite!
B00UMMM1SU|5|Really like it. Well worth the money spent.
B0018QS7GO|5|I used and loved this product for myself and my three daughters for 8+ years.  When Alterna changed their formulations, this product became difficult then impossible to get at a reasonable price.  I tried the new similar product from Alterna called Pin Straight.  It is OK but leaves my hair a bit greasy feeling and weighed down and I have to wash my hair more often.<br /><br />So, FYI, I have finally found a product that works the same as the Alterna Hemp Straightening Balm--at least for me, no word from daughter #2 who has curlier hair.  The product I have found as a replacement is Sally Hershberger \\"Go With The Blow.\\"  Here on Amazon, but cheaper in the store.<br /><br />Miss this product a lot.
B001D4FF66|5|I have been using Wen now for 4 months straight and just after one use it left my hair feeling like I just left the salon.  I get a ton of comments on my hair, saying how healthy and shiny it is.  I also have curly/wavy hair and everytime I would blow dry my hair it would be frizzy and require heat to calm it down.  But now I can blow dry it and leave the house without frizz and it looks like I actually used a curling iron/straigthner on it.  I can't think of anything that is better for your hair.  It is worth the money and I will be a life time user.
B000H88QOM|2|I don't know what this is supposed to do, but all it did was make my hair tacky feeling.
B000B9Y920|5|Works well with my natural kinky curly hair.
B001L3JWBS|5|I love this hair dye although it is quite expensive. This dye wont color black, it will leave you with a dark brown tone that i was looking for. I ordered before dark brown and my hair turned somewhat light, so i decided to try black, and it is exactly what I wanted. After using this dye, your hair will look healthy, shiny and manageable, and excellent healthy alternative way of coloring your hair.
B00H4BZM9M|5|good stuff
B004PXM3US|2|I bought this last summer and it finally gave up on me, but instead of replacing it I found one I liked better for what I needed.  As cute as the styling was (very slim and sleek) I found that the two heads could never do a close cut or even a medium cut. On top of that I repeatedly had hairs snagged in the blades (even though I followed instructions) and it was very painful. But I never had irritation afterwards, so I didn't mind that aspect. Maybe it was just a bad product for what I wanted, but I would recommend a different shaver.
B000CBR7EO|4|GREAT PRODUCT! JUST WET ENUF AND HELPED GET THE JOB DONE ;)  just wish I had gotten more than 1 at that price!lol
B000OSUJH2|5|love the sent it's awesome
B00DYZ7ZCO|5|My 5 star rating is relative to other electric shavers, as I would prefer to wet shave with a safety razor, but certain areas of face just refuse to tolerate it.<br />  As a result of the bumps I developed (while still using an electric shaver), I engaged in extensive experimentation with both rotary, foil and blade razors, and I think the reader will find that, as diverse as our faces are, so will your results vary.<br />  I tried the top end Norelco 3D shaver (as well as a few lower end Norelcos), and as much as I wanted to like them (better than foils on a few days growth, excellent customer service and good value, especially on the cheaper models), I found all models to be irritating.<br />  I've owned Panasonics (used them mostly wet, which is counter to how electrics operate...the lather causes the whiskers to lie flat), Wet, they caused excess irritation, and dry, they get hotter than a clothing iron; more irritation.<br />  I've electric shaved (for about 30 years) most of my adult life, and really liked the two (2) Braun 3550 single foil shavers (long since discontinued). About nine (9) years ago I tracked down a Grundig shaver (also long discontinued, but once considered the Mercedes of electric shavers).<br />  It was nice for a few years, but I began experimenting with countless pre-shaves,(I tired of the dry itchy feeling) which may have been the catalyst for my bumps, (or the shaver was beginning to age?)<br />  I decided to re-try the Braun 7-series (which I tried a number of years ago and returned; I didn't then see it as an improvement over my Grundig.)<br />  I've found my bumps have subsided, and I experience little or no irritation (though it takes more time than rotary or wet shaving).<br />  I suggest the user follow Braun's recommendations and not wash ones face any time soon before shaving (sounds a little grungy; wash after if necessary), and don't use any pre-shave. (I don't use after shave either; does your face really need chemicals splashed on it?)<br />  The Braun 7-Series isn't perfect, but it is the best I've found so far.
B00VGNWB0C|3|Purchased Wen's basic starter package directly from Wen. Made sure I only purchased the starter one-time-purchase offer, not the monthly auto send that draws money from my credit card each month. You can imagine my surprise when two months later I receive another package from Wen and learn I'm on their auto-ship program. I have to say that a call directly to the company's accounts department was promptly dealt with and I was taken off their auto-ship program (though the wait background music was extremely irritating and jangling...). Point being, I was careful to NOT agree to their auto-ship program.<br /><br />As for the product I would not say it is bad, but I didn't find it great either. It's simply a 'good' product, which is why I gave it a 3 star rating. I have dealt with a scalp scaling condition off and on for years now and when the concept of a 'cleansing conditioner' being used in place of shampoo really hit me as a possible way of dealing with scalp scaling, which numerous hair dressers had told me was probably the problem. Problem was I could not find a single shampoo gentle enough or free of drying or stripping ingredients to stop over drying my sensitive scalp.<br /><br />I came across a cleansing conditioner product sold at Walgreens and gave it a try. It worked! I thought I'd give the Wen product a try. It's thicker than the product I was and still use. Also, Wen recommends using far more of their product than the competitor product recommends, which is really not necessary. Also, the non-Wen cleansing conditioner I use is half the cost of Wen's cleansing conditioner products, and for me, since both do a good job of keeping my scalp scaling to a minimum, I'll go with the less expensive offering with the added benefit I don't have to use as much at each hair cleaning.<br /><br />Bottom line being, go with the more easily available brand at Walgreens that costs half the price of Wen products.
B007SBDKBU|5|I love the original Angel but it is too strong for me to wear very often, and a tiny drop suffices! This version is much softer, lighter, and, while definitely belonging to the Angel family, is much more discreet and wearable. It reminds me a great deal of Angel Innocent, another favorite. The citrusy opening is very nice for summer. It's not nearly as rich a gourmand as the original Angel, so yes, it is more of a cologne version. And the bottle looks like it came straight from a mermaid's cave, love it!
B002N5MI2S|2|If you are black plastic tube series user looking for the next one, be warned.
B00292BRA4|1|I owned one of these for about 4-5 years before the battery died (to be expected of a battery that age) and it was decent enough for the price, but you should certainly buy something else at this point in time. This model is no longer in production and third party sellers are now selling it for TWICE what I paid at Target in 2009. If you're lazily shopping by price, you might be tricked into thinking this is one of Wahl's better trimmers but it's actually a budget model. The Wahl 9818 is cheaper and superior in every way - made in USA, stainless steel body, stainless steel blades. This model will rust and pull your hair.
B001E95GX2|5|It's ideal for my hair.  I love it
B003BL7M7E|4|I use this comb every day. Helps to not pull out any more hair out of my long hair as I'm losing some hair.
B000NJE40K|4|Great it hasn't tipped over at all. Gets the job done.
B002B8VE4U|3|Not very travel friendly.  I was hoping that it would fold up.. it doesn't.  It works great as a back up to my normal hair dryer.
B001B0YMB6|5|This cosmetic organizer is fantastic! It has enough compartments to store lipsticks, lip glosses, brushes, bronzers, eye shadows, etc.  I was able to put my Q-tips and cotton swabs in 2 of the compartments (not something I was originally planning).  The organizer itself is a great size (not too big, not too small) and sits neatly on my counter.
B009K7NA1U|5|I love this moisturizer and love that it has sunscreen as well.
B0084QHIJS|5|This is the best 30% Glycolic peel I have tried and for the price It is so worth trying !!<br />My skin actually peeled with the first application.I have tried many of the peels on Amazon and this is the 1 for me.
B00GQ9I9IO|5|I think that by using my BEST ORGANIC Vitamin C Serum my face might look better eventually.  It certainly is delightful to use, and is probably working away at my wrinkles and lines without my realizing same.  Time will tell.
B002UEKTBE|4|I ordered the solution and awaiting for it to come in, but I couldn't wait so I found the same lotion 4 oz. Ultra dark at bed bath and beyond for 10 its better then paying 24.95 plus tax and shipping from site. Amazon has it cheaper but if can call your local bed bath beyond and you may find it. This product works great I suggest to wear gloves because it will stain ur hands. Very nice non orange tan. If the lotion works great then I know the solution is even better, can't wait :)
B00I3OMMCO|3|The smell was the first thing that killed me. At first, I HATED the smell. It ruined all my food all day and just smelled like dip or something. The next day it wasn't as bad. Maybe I got used to it or thought the dip smell was MANLY. The smell is strong, though, and you do smell it all day. I don't put very much on but I hate touching my beard all day because my hands get greasy and beeswaxy. Don't really notice much difference in softness, either. I don't hate this product, but I would never buy it again. Especially at the price.<br /><br />You got me again, Made in America!
B003H146PY|5|It was a beautiful smile and you will definitely notice how girls going to be nice with you and talk with you. I highly recommend it.
B004CS578Q|5|Works fabulously! Send me about 2 gallons.
B001LNOCW2|5|I was skeptical about purchasing this lotion over the more popular L'Occitane Brand but was very pleased with the light and clean scent.  Cheaper than the more popular brand but equally delightful.
B00HSE4WJ6|5|Great deal on make up brushes! Nice brushes
B00LAQPTG8|2|Wig is nice and voluminous, but it doesn't fit an adult head.
B000EGOKV0|5|I love the fragrance and the way it suds.  It's very moisturizing to my skin.  So happy to be able to purchase so much at one time and I can share it with my friends and family.
B004WPBHWE|5|love it
B004GFR3GY|5|Love the stamp and scraper, works great.
B0009V1YRS|1|I was very excited to get this product after I had read some of the reviews... but when I received my iron the on/off switch didn't work and I think that I got a knock-off. I emailed the seller but was told that I had to send mine back in first which I couldn't go with out an iron so I had to keep it and use it not working properly. I feel I paid a lot of money for a product that doesn't work correctly.
B00S7BKCSY|5|Love love love this brush!  I use it daily to apply my BB cream and it goes on flawless with this brush!!!
B00QB79FMA|5|Items are durable and delivered quickly.
B00IW58KEI|1|I used this twice a day for a month and not change.
B002MZ8BK2|5|I just got my Konad stamper, and I can't believe I've gone this long without it. Being impatient and a \\"learn by doing\\" type, although I did watch a YouTube video while I was waiting for this to arrive, I tore it open and got right to stamping. Even with no practice and cheap polish, my nails look amazing and professionally done.<br /><br />I'm not sure what another reviewer meant about \\"filing\\" your stamper before you use it; I didn't do anything to prep the stamper or scraper except for taking them out of the package, and they worked just fine. I used a gold chrome from Wet n' Wild as my base color, and a black polish from Color Cosmetic that I picked up super cheap - six polishes for $5. That combo worked great; the Color Cosmetic black goes on opaque and is super for stamping (the WnW gold chrome is a little too faint as a stamping color but great as a base).<br /><br />The stamper cleaned up beautifully. The scraper was a little harder to clean up and still has some staining on the plastic handle, but I'm probably going to try using an old gift card instead, as the metal blade put some very light scratches on my stamping plate.<br /><br />This stamper is a must for anyone who's addicted to doing their nails. Shipping was very fast and even though the stamper comes in protective plastic, the seller also put it in a nice thick padded envelope, so it arrived in perfect condition.
B003E3IOPS|5|I started fighting some pretty frustrating acne a few years ago, and switched to Proactiv to see if it would help. It definitely did, making my complexion a lot more manageable.<br />However, I have a couple of other products that help in conjunction with the Proactiv line-- the Olay Professional ProX Facial Cleansing Brush really makes a huge difference, and SKIN79's BB cream really seems to make my skin happy. Between Proactiv, Olay and SKIN79, my skin stays clear the majority of the time-- I'm sure that Proactiv plays a large, but certainly not singlehanded, part in the recipe.
B000R830IE|4|Not any hotter than a hot iron gets and I like the brushes to make softer curls.
B004PXIR1W|1|I really don't understand the logic of Conair. They have built a product that a lot of people want to use. But their build quality is terrible.<br /><br />Short story is, mine started malfunctioning after the first time I used it.<br /><br />For a product that is meant to be used in the bathroom, you'd expect it to be water proof, or at the very least, water resistant. This trimmer is neither. Water gets into it even if you do nothing that would be considered submerging it or taking a shower with it. Just by rinsing off the blade water can get inside the electronics.<br /><br />I called customer service and here are my observations:<br />1. They expect me to pay the shipping to send it back<br />2. They expect me to include money with the trimmer to they can use the money to pay to send me a new one if they choose<br />3. The amount of time for them to choose to send me a new one is 6 weeks<br />4. The serial number is not printed on the trimmer itself, it is on the power brick/cord<br /><br />Here's how mine malfunctions:<br />1. It thinks it is charging even when it isn't<br />2. The battery runs down as fast as it can -- as if I was using it continuously, even though the power is off<br />3. Intermittently the blade size adjustment won't work when I press the up/down buttons<br />4. One time I couldn't even turn it off<br /><br />Here are the crappy product decisions they made:<br /><br />1. You have to charge the trimmer for 16 hours continuously before you use it<br />2. You cannot use it while it is plugged in<br />3. You cannot use it in the shower<br />4. It is not water proof<br />5. The serial number is not on the product itself<br />6. Their return policy is a joke: the customer pays shipping both ways and has to wait for weeks to receive a new one<br /><br />Dear Conair, if you built this product with even a modicum of care, you'd probably make millions more dollars from loyal customers. As it stands, I'm going to get rid of your product and try a competitor's.
B000052WYN|5|This is my eyeliner, if this product disappears my life will grow cold, dark, sad and smudgey... Tricky for beginners but once you get the hang of applying it, you will have long lasting, awesomely lined eyes. It has awesome staying power. It is a bold black though perfect for goths, rockabilly's or anyone who wants to do the cat eye look.
B000UR90OK|3|Use when necessary during hair cut days,It is OK
B000QUKBA8|5|nice bath fragrance
B0050ZIPUC|5|Love this perfume.  AND such a great deal too.
B001KO6I7O|5|Smells divine!
B00OCM0BHO|2|Looks fake. But it is easy to keep clean and lays nicely.
B003NTFDFM|3|This is NOT a bad product, in fact it is quite nice. However my skin did not feel any different or cleaner than it does after I use my usual organic cleansers that costs half the price. I found it quite curious that the 4  5 Star reviews are written by people that only reviewed products by this company, seems a little fishy to me. Having said that, if money is no object, this is a nice cleanser, but there are others that do the job just as well and are also all natural that cost half the price.
B000F35R00|5|This clipper is replacing a Tweezerman clipper that I bought at a CVS some two years ago. Compared to the Tweezerman clippers -- which set me back $12 -- these clippers are way better despite being about the same price. They have a heavier and more solid feel, leading me to believe they are more durable and of superior construction to their Tweezerman counterparts. Of course, only time will tell for sure.<br /><br />For starts, these clippers definitely clip much better than my Tweezerman's did out-of-the-box and they are light-years ahead of those cheap generics. The rounded contour of these clippers is perfect for progressively clipping nails while keeping the nail itself more-or-less rounded; all my previous clippers have been \\"straight\\" in comparison, and would always produce annoyingly sharp points and \\"polygonal\\" nails. Consequently, these are probably the first clippers I've used where I don't feel an all-consuming urge to file my nails right after clipping them; the clippers are able to produce a smooth enough cut free of sharp points that I am okay with not filing my nails down to smooth them out.<br /><br />Not only that, but I believe the rounded countour is also what makes these the first clippers I've ever used where I don't tend to accidentally \\"overcut\\" my nails and expose the more sensitive flesh at the tip of my finger. This is an issue which, in the past, would leave me with sore tips for a day or two thereafter. As a guitar player, I prefer to keep my fingernails short so I can grip my strings better (the longer my nails, the more they would dig into my fretboard and \\"push\\" my fingers away from the strings slightly... a feeling I greatly dislike). Overcutting my nails and playing the guitar would make this a painful endeavor and I had long woed being unable to clip my nails and play guitar comfortably immediately afterwards. This clipper solves that issue beautifully.<br /><br />These clippers lack a nail-catcher which is perfectly okay for me as I would rarely use nail-catchers on my previous clippers anyways. While nail-catchers are somewhat effective, I've noticed they always get in the way of seeing what I'm actually cutting (leading to poor cuts or overcuts). Given that nail-catchers don't catch all the nails, and I have a tendency to tip my cutter downwards which would always result in caught clippings falling out, the inconveniences of all the nail-catchers I've used over the years far outweigh the actual convenience of having one. It's always seemed more reasonable to cut my nails over a small garbage can and then vacuum the spot afterwards to clean up any clippings that might have gone flying.<br /><br />Additionally, it's worth noting that though Seki sells a toe-nail clipper, for me these fingernail clippers are more than adequate for my toes as well. I'm not sure what other people's toenails are like, but all my toes -- with the exception of my big toes -- have nails that are smaller than my fingernails. It doesn't make sense to pay $15 or so for another bigger \\"toenail\\" clipper when I'd probably only use it to cut my big toe-nails. Based on that, these fingernail clippers make great toenail clippers as well.<br /><br />All-in-all, these are excellent nail-clippers. I'd been wanting clippers like this for a long time, and I finally got 'em!I would rarely use nail-catchers on my previous clippers anyways.

B00IS6URYC|5|So cute and fun!  So light, you don't even feel them in your hair!  They are the best ponytail holders!
B003S17772|5|Love these lashes, and oh so perfect for the frugal shopper!  I use lashes everyday and am able to get at least a week's worth of wear from one pair of these lashes. They are bendable enough for easy application, yet sturdy enough to last. Shipping was free from China, and came 2 weeks sooner than posted.
B00F1ZRPUW|4|Works AMAZING! So fast, and didn't pull any of my own hair out. I wish there was a spray version of this, because you can't really tell how much your using with the drip cap. But other than that, I LOVE!!!
B008U5XS2O|4|This iron is totally worth the money I spent on it. I wish I had not bought my old iron.
B0081NLR0K|5|great
B00022DV98|1|I tried to find this deodorant at the store where I first started buying it. Now it is hard to come by. Online is so much easier.
B000THCPDO|5|The other great reviews prompted me to try this self tanner... and I'm totally happy I did!  First off, it's actually NATURAL looking.  Even on my fair skin I actually look instantly bronzed rather than like I have somehow morphed into a oompa-loompa's cousin.  I also despise the funky odor associated with most self-tanners...and this one has a light natural fragrance that doesn't bother me at all.  My skin is pretty sensitive and break-out prone, so I was happy to find that my temperamental skin had no issues with faux tan.  Finally, I LOVE that you get an instant tan from this product and can actually see where you will develop a tan before it happens... makes it kind of goof proof.  You definitely have to wash your hands well after applying... lots of soap and water to avoid the dead give-away brown finger effect (yuck, not a good look).
B00D18ZDM8|4|I have used Bic razors many times, & they are usually very good quality. The price is also very reasonable because there are four razors in each package.
B005QO3HVE|5|I had a horrible rash under my breasts and I used this twice a day for a few weeks.  The rash is gone.  It does smell kind of funky...my husband said like Vicks. But it took away the rash with having to use harsh cortisone or other creams.
B007AMGFAK|3|I bought this flat iron after my very expensive one cr@pped out on me.  I didn't want to spend a fortune on another one, so I saw this one and decided to try it.  For the price, you really can't complain TOO much.  However, I'm going to complain a little....it's awkward to hold for one, shaped a bit weird and hard to use as compared to a &#34;regular&#34; shaped flat iron.  Secondly, I don't like that it doesn't beep or anything when the iron reaches the selected temperature.  Third, I don't like that the LED is on the same side as the on/off buttons etc.  It makes it awkward to adjust temperature and use the buttons to do so.  Fourth, even at 450° I don't feel like it straightens my hair like my more expensive one did.<br />The good:  it was wayyyy cheaper and I'm going to keep it for that reason and because it will make a good back up flat iron.  But this being said, I'm going to purchase another expensive iron and hopefully be happier.<br />Thanks Amazon for the amazing service, as always.
B00NMSWGCW|4|I read the reviews and love this product! I'm really into facial regiments and use this product about twice a week!
B00CPKHDDK|5|Love it
B00752ZKSS|5|Great giant bobby pins. Just what I needed.
B00D3O2XW8|1|Very cheap looking and fake
B000C1UBR4|5|I like this kind of smell. it is simple and sweet-scented which is very suitable for gentleman. haha, it is really a good choice to take it on your date
B002CSPIKA|5|I have tried every single acne product and nothing had worked for me.  I used proactiv, murad, clean and clear, neutrogena, etc. Nothing worked :(, one day doing research on the web I found this kit that sounded pretty promising since they give you not only a 30 day money back guarantee but a whole year!!! I gave it a try and have been using it ever since (this was 3 yrs ago).  I have recommended the product to my sister and a couple of friends. They are amazed by the results!!!  Thank you forever Exposed Skin Care!!!
B000ARQ90S|5|Works great!  I don't exactly have much to compare it to, as it's all I've used so far, but I can't think of anything better.
B009YVXAXU|1|ELF usually has pretty great stuff for super cheap, but this one was a total bust. It creases HORRIBLY. It migrated all around my eyes and caused my mascara and eyeliner to smear all over too. At first I just wanted to toss this, but decided to try it with a coordinating powder on top to set it. The powder did solve the migrating and smearing issue, BUT it still did crease. Not anywhere near as bad as when I tried using it on its own, but there was still creasing and creased shadow looks awful. I really hate tossing new makeup, no matter what the price point is. Since I purchased a lighter shimmery shade (French Lace I believe it's called), I'm going to attempt to use it as a brow bone highlighter (WITH powder of course!).
B000C1W3JS|4|I love the subtle mango smell this cologne has which gives it a sweet edge to it.  The cologne isn't too strong or too light and lasts about 6-8 hours for me.  It defiantly smells the best once it settles in after a while.  This is great for the colder months but I definitely wouldn't want to wear this on the warmer days as it would be too overpowering.  Everyone who smells this cologne seems to like it.
B00LRZ8O9G|1|I thought I was getting 3 items. Wrong! I was looking for lip gloss for my daughter what  a surprise to find mini perfumes instead. One was already leaking too, in the box. Glad I opened it before wrapping it for Christmas next time I'll just go to the Victoria's Secret store to get such a pricy item.
B0046ZUW7G|5|Arrived on time and has a wonderful scent and is a quality product!  I absolutely LOVE Edens Gardens oils and highly recommend them!
B006L2137U|3|Really wanted this to be perfect for me but it is just okay.  I use it daily and it helps when I am not applying powder.  It might be a good base under foundation but I don't wear any.  Make sure you apply it quickly but thoroughly to avoid build up
B0017TOODW|5|It is great alone or even to combine with other scents. The staying power is wonderful so I absolutely can't complain. I get loads of compliments on the way I smell which they say is clean and fresh.
B00GPHBZCO|4|Bought this item for my wife and she absolutely loves it.  She has really no complaints about product.
B00A6RZVL0|5|I had a ghd before, and when it broke after about 5 years (to my doing), I was lost.<br />I went online and came across this one at a WONDEFUL price.  This is one of the best hot irons I have EVER used.<br />Does not burn your hair, leaves it silky smooth.<br />I will never use any other Flat Iron!  You wont be dissapointed!
B0080EEMCA|5|Very good
B004KEZ9NA|1|time and it still came out in two washes.  So I used the other half on the same hair but let it sit about 90 minutes.  It came out in a couple washes and left her hair an almost dirty grayish color.  She was so excited and now my parents won't let me try a different brand.
B00CYOYL3C|5|It's hard to decide what to buy when it comes to wrinkle creams. I read a review about the Dermarie system on the Internet. I bought this product specifically to diminish the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. I have been using it now for about 3 weeks and have noticed less puffiness and the dark circles have faded.
B00GOCUECW|5|Great product. Highlights and color stay so much longer using this product. Will buy again.
B00J2Z1PE4|5|Great gift for the woman in my family. Not too pricy, but almost. Might buy a different variation for my next gift.
B0000A1WGK|4|I like this, but I do not love this.
B001B54XL0|2|I tried this hair color after lifting my hair to a dark, brassy blonde hoping that the extra light ash blonde would counteract my brass. I had read pretty good things about it online and was excited to try it. This was my first Garnier Nutrisse hair dye ever and I was pleased to see a large developer bottle, but was disappointed when I realized there is not enough product to actually fill it. Bummer #1.<br />Something I wasn't expecting at all was the horrible smell. I thought this stuff was supposed to smell better than other dyes? Nope, the chemicals actually stung my nostrils and it was awful. My hair actually still smells faintly like it two showers later...<br />I did, however, like the consistency of the color creme. It was nice and thick, making it easy to work with.<br />Overall, this product did nothing to my hair - it was still just as brassy and dark after using it. This was majorly disappointing especially considering I paid more for this dye than I typically do for my preferred brand. Oh well, you live & learn I guess.
B00NV9KLXS|4|This is a great product...especially when in a hurry.  I gave it four stars as I think if you suffer from extremely dry skin or just what the winter can do to your skin in the cold, you may need lotion.  I like this especially has I hate &#34;lubing-up&#34; my body before bed if I happen to take a shower at night or if you're doing a quickie shower to rinse off (ex. after mowing or after cleaning up a baby explosion).  This is a great substitute as you take your shower like normal, apply this on your body while in the shower, rinse yourself, hose down the shower quickly, pat dry, lotion on your face, lotion on your feet and night-night.
B003ZUPAFW|4|Great  and convenient to have. No space required.  Perfect for a quick clean up.
B005C60C1E|5|Hello ... I received the order and I am very happy and pleased with the purchase. Packing in excellent condition and fast to reach my hands.
B00BZ1QN2C|3|I think this is overpriced, but it is pretty good. It leaves your face smooth. I don't have acne, so I can't attest to it's detox effects. It does feel good, though.
B003Z2HF6C|3|The lather on this is rich and the smell is nice, but I find after a couple of consecutive days of use my hair feels strangely coated and thick and loses some shine.  I still keep it in my rotation, but I do need to mix it up with other ones in order to avoid too much build-up.
B005FRJKWW|4|Like comments before mine, I received 3 of the same color & the files themselves aren't the greatest, but for the price, they get the job done.
B00BF27PGY|5|I love this perfume! It smells amazing and I loved how fast I got it! This is the best thing I have ever gotten. The smell isn't too strong or sweet, it is kind of masculine; but also feminine at the same time!
B00GY1NIGM|5|Love these glasses & the vendor Awesome look for the price!
B0000AFUT3|1|Light work the first few times.  Now it don't got used
B000I6DCSI|4|The ingredients given are are totally incorrect. The foundation is water and aloe based, with no silicones or synthetic chemicals.<br /><br />The coverage is very sheer, and does not really build. The product is very thin, so more comes out of the tube than I'd like if I'm not careful. It gives a very natural look, not shiny but not matte.<br /><br />I like this foundation, but wish it had better coverage. I have to use a lot of additional concealer for red spots and blemishes, and would prefer a foundation that covered those imperfections.
B000LVWAPG|3|Not as full as it should have been.
B00MYXSRAQ|5|Exactly as described
B008LX7C3Q|3|You can easily find this mug on auction sites, but not usually in the original box with a full (or nearly full as I think some leaked out during shipping) after shave bottle.<br /><br />I was assuming after shaves would have a shelf life and this stuff was probably no good anymore, but I read online that Avon fragrances generally are very stable and still usable many years later (with the exception of a fragrance called Oland).  So, I decided to try it and about a hour later I was washing it off.  I am not surprised Avon does not sell this stuff anymore.  Some people online say it literally smells like leather, but to me it didn't smell like anything I have smelled before that I can recall and I didn't like it.<br /><br />The mug has a nice old-fashioned look and the one I got seems to be in brand new condition.  Also, there is an added nostalgia for me in that it reminds me of the days when my mother was an \\"Avon lady\\" back when Avon sold everything in decorative containers. You just don't see after shave bottle shaped like cars anymore.  There is even an aftershave bottle shaped like a shaving brush and one shaped like a DE razor.<br /><br />Only negative I have with this mug is that it is too narrow.  Larger shave soaps won't fit in the mug.  So, I use it to hold shaving accessories and have another mug for my soap.
B0067F28ZW|5|I bought these as a gift for my mom.  She loves them.
B002N5MI2S|5|So far so good. I like the fragrance.
B00336EUTK|4|Seems to be working.  The non-slip strips are great!  I have previously tried whitening trays and was not at all happy about the taste or the results (lack of!).  Will definitely purchase these Crest strips again.
B001PHLCSQ|5|I love the way this feels.  Makes my skin feel smooth and soft.
B00GN2OSHK|1|I have never given a one star rating before. I was looking so forward to receiving this gift set - I love Clinique and this set contained some of my favorite things - unfortunately the items were not inside a plastic bag - they were loose within the cosmetic case and something (eye shadow - brown powder?) had spilled out into the case and covered everything, ruining the inside of the case, and of course, ruining the shadow and other items...  There was a very small dent in the package - not enough though to cause all this... If only the inner items had been packaged in a plastic bag as the other set that I ordered from the very same Supplier at the very same time...  That set was in perfect condition - the only difference in packaging being that inner items were in a sealed bag... I'm very disappointed that I had to return this Winter Gift Set...
B000JG1QR6|5|I buy this for my daughter every birthday.  She loves this product.
B00BBI8KD4|5|I'm very happy with my purchase.
B00811VPZE|5|OMG, 35 years and I've finally found a product to tame my unruly frizzy hair.  I can honestly say every frizz remedy I've tried over the past 35 years has not worked like Moisture Block.  My hair would start to frizz two days before the rain would arrive!  Follow the suggested instructions and you can't miss.  I apply a dollop over my conditioner in the shower and then rinse out and another dollop after I leave the shower before styling.  The first time I used a lot of this product because I really wanted it to work.  Now that I know IT WORKS I do not use as much.  I cannot believe my hair doesn't revert back in the rain.  Love this product!
B000TR8RXQ|5|great gift!
B001C4Q3UY|1|it's not good !it's  useless!!! it made me get more acne.it can not removal scar. i don't like it. i don't want to buy any more
B008RKNO9Y|5|Awesome product.  Works well, smooths hair and leaves it soft.  Great for thick hair but I also use it on my thin hair (little bit.)  Just use a small amount.  A little goes a long way.  I should mention that we blow dry our hair when using this product so I do not know how it works if you air dry. It dispenses like a traditional mousse, so be  careful not to get a lot as all you need is a little.  But I will absolutely buy again.
B00CHSZVB6|5|Love this as my new facial moisturizer! My son as eczema and reacts to steroid treatment. So, now we keep the eczema in check with this product as well as DermaZinc therapy soap. Recommend-YES!
B00GY05XDO|4|My girlfriend loved this
B00J16E29E|5|Awesome
B004RI6XH0|3|I got these along with the Tiny Point Tip tweezers, and I have to say, Im sad these weren't better. The pointed tip is really great for singling out super fine hairs, but the grip lacks so much that you cant pull out anything!<br /><br />I'd just go with [[ASIN:B000JNJOZA B000JNJOZA]] - if you're looking for a great tweezer.
B00FO1QHGG|5|Three years ago my girlfriend recommended this glove to me. I bought one, I used it a lot and it is still in a good shape. The company change its design a little, so I order a new one. This one I like even better, it is really a good product, I recommend it to everyone. I believe because of using this glove my skin always look fresh and bright.
B00C3GKNAQ|5|I love it!
B000C1Z16A|5|The product have been discontinued from the store and the fact that i found it here was awesome ! !
B000O7JK0A|5|My husband and I are both active duty in the USAF and our daughter is in daycare 9hrs a day. She has never had a case of lice and I spray this in her hair every morning before we leave the house. It has a nice, soft smell, it keeps her hair silky and healthy, and it must work fairly well at keeping bugs/lice away. While I'm swatting gnats/flies away when outside (because they're attracted to my conditioner smell?) she is just fine... It's great with controlling static, too. I used it a few times while on vacation to keep the static out of my own hair.
B00009RB0X|1|A hunk of junk. Lasted less than a week.I never had a shaver last less than two years.Last norelco I would buy.
B004FS7XXU|5|love this product
B002MJL9B6|4|This is a nice lip gloss. The color is perfect for every day wear and can be re-applied as needed. This is not my go-to lip gloss but I like it.
B001ECQ7G4|5|I've been using Tend Skin for a few years now, on the reccommendation from my asthetitan at Paul Mitchell Salon. To be honest, I didn't purchase it right away, in fact it was a few months before I finally bit the bullet and purchased it. I've been loyal to it ever since and will continue to use this product in the future. One of the great things about this product is it's versatility. I shave my face, laser my chest and wax my abs. I'll be lasering my abs as well, just doing everything sections at a time because it hurts. No matter what technique I'm using to remove hair, I know that by applying this product I will have smoother, ingrown hair free skin on about 90-95% of where ever I use it. It does have a strong alcohol smell (and the sting that goes with it), but that only lasts for maybe 20 seconds? It's more so right after you've shaved, waxed or lasered. I'm assuming because the skin is already irritated. In all honesty, however, after that 20 seconds my skin already starts to feel better than it did before. I apply it generously about twice a day, though sometimes I do forget (especially in the mornings when I'm in a hurry). If you're unsure of whether or not to get this, do it! And when you do, buy it on Amazon. I just bought mine for under $15 for the larger 8oz bottle. The same bottle goes for twice that at Ulta and Sephora. Just plan ahead, I ran out a few days ago. I thought I'd just buy it from Sephora but it's just too expensive there, so I'll just wait for my order to come in. Since it's half the price, I should just buy two to keep one for a backup. In fact, I think I'll do that right now before I forget!
B00BB8ZHL2|5|It is Very easy to use and heats up quickly. The only  downfall is that I kept accidentally hitting the temp setting while using the wand. I would recommend this to a friend.
B005P0XLF6|5|I have very sensitive skin and the glycerine soap is gentle and non-drying.  It is mild enough that even the light scent doesn't irritate.  Package was packed well and delivery was fast.  Thank you.
B00ZCI20YY|4|I really like it! Got it a week earlier than expected which is great, it's super soft, you can't see the wig net thing (i got the black/blue wig) and its just good quality for the price you payed. One thing that made me not give it 5 stars is that it's a little too small for my head but i can fix that. Anyway great product and i'll probably buy another wig soon!
B000HM7DS8|5|Very nicely packaged.  Every bathroom should have at least two in the medicine cabinet
B004O2HB48|3|I think that this product was only ok and it was overpriced. The only saving grace was that it smelled great.
B007785C24|2|Kind of on the oily side of shampoo's. I do feel &#34;clean&#34; afterwards but I hate that oily feeling . Smell is pleasant, however, I  will not buy again.
B004BYOE58|5|Perfect color for my faded red/gray hair.
B00BNHKI92|4|Package  came in as expected
B00LYXD0TA|5|Over Sally Hansen color or your own nail polish (let completely dry first), this gel as a top coat is great!
B001MA0QY2|5|Love this straightner! It's powerful and it lasts!<br />I bought one for myself a year ago and when my mom's old one broke, I didn't look anywhere else, I bought her the same one !
B0003021SG|2|not good
B008RIF0NY|4|Ends are slightly off, but not enough to matter for applying rhinestones. These are good enough, affordable (cheap) set of tweezers that are not for eyebrow use.
B004FEKA3E|5|100%. Satisfied. Ordered the lotion Tuesday evening & it arrived Thursday(I selected 5 day shipping and still got it in 2 days) Nicely packaged and lotion still sealed in plastic. Also the lotion smells great, and gives you a nice bronzed color! Will be ordering again 😀
B0050PZ0SW|5|Love the products, just what my grandson needed for his hair. Controls his curls and take away the dryness. With his hair of two different texture this pruduct gave him the balance he needs.
B00ROE0KLE|5|I love this!!! My feet are so soft from using it. I recommend using after you get out of a bath or soaking your feet in warm water before use.
B0013F8JXG|5|Best there is my husband will not use anything else and I will not buy anything else theres nothing better
B000ETJ4WC|5|It was exacltly as ordered and clearly a sample and sample priced.  It was nice to have a spritz of Alien when needed!
B005OYDID8|3|I like it, however after using this shaver the on and off switch doesn't always turn off this devise, but requires 2 or 3 or 4 attempts.
B002RT70WI|2|I sprayed the product on my wet hair then blew dry them. It gave me a weird, rough, not comfy texture. I am not sure how well it works to protect my hair from heat, but I don't enjoy the product staying on my hair.
B001E95GTQ|5|I recently had a horrible highlighting job that left me with yellow hair instead of my requested blonde. I have determined that blonde is just not for me and opted to go back to a brown closer to my natural color. This color covered all the screw ups of the professional job and left my hair extremely silky after the conditioner. You can't beat the 10 minute waiting either, I'm so happy I've found this products and can avoid costly trips to the salon. Maybe I can even splurge on a more expensive cut!!
B0007CXWZG|4|I like it just fine. It doesn't make my hair feel dirty at the end of the day like some hair sprays do.
B0070HV9RE|5|I got this brush for my daughter and she absolutely loved it! It's the only brush she will let me use on her hair in the morning because it makes her hair straight and the brush doesn't hurt like the other ones we have. I love it so much I got another one for my niece for her birthday.
B0096SRIS4|5|Quick to lather and smells amazing... I went around having people smell it and everyone I work with thinks it smells amazing... couldn't be happier... I probably could have gotten some more expensive soaps to try out but I got in to wet shaving to try and save some money and I don't think I could have gotten a better deal... I've used Col Conk Bay rum and it works well but this soap wins hands down...
B00004D3EL|4|We don't use everything in this kit.  I think we would have been better off purchasing what we needed separately.
B0013902SW|5|Like this stuff!
B00JFFMA7W|5|Have not used this yet...smells great!
B00O8ODHOA|4|My teeth are definitely cleaner. This is my first electric brush and I noticed a big difference, my teeth are smoother and whiter. I definitely recommend getting an electric toothbrush. However, while it cleans your teeth much better than a manual brush, it might make you forget to clean the other parts of your mouth, like on and around your tongue, the space between your gums and your lips/cheek, etc... which can still leave your breath less than fresh. So I find myself having to use a manual brush for these areas, since the small head of the electric brush does not hold the toothpaste for use in this stage of brushing. And I'm ok with doing that. The 'too much pressure' sensor is also helpful, and the lights on the brush turn red to let you know.<br /><br />But on the bluetooth side, the functionality is not as exciting as I would've expected. You can watch the timer on your phone, which helps when you're first getting used to it, and it stores the times you brushed and for how long, and, after setting it up before hand, you can tell it if you flossed and cleaned your tongue. But you can't go back and edit it after. Plus, after a few weeks, I stopped logging my brushes, because it really doesn't serve very much of a purpose.<br />I feel like adding some useful bluetooth functionality, or at least the ability to edit the entries after to add flossing/tongue or something, would add practically zero cost, since it already has a smart chip on it, and it already connects with the phone. It would just be creative thinking on the app design side. If I was buying again, I probably wouldn't have spent the extra money ($40) for the bluetooth connectivity, and would've gone with the Pro 4000.
B000U6VOSG|4|I've tried several waterproof mascaras which all leave me with smudgey panda eyes at the end of the day, apparently as I have oily lids, so I was really happy that this one did not come off at all while wearing it. It's also pretty decent at thickening lashes.  My only complaint (and why I haven't given it 5 stars) is that while it worked wonderfully in winter, I think the heat or humidity of summer affects the formula somehow and it comes out clumpy and sort of sticky when applying. It dries OK -- you can't see the clumping -- but sometimes it feels like my lashes are sticking together when I blink.  Otherwise, it's really good if you're after a mascara that doesn't smudge off during the day.
B0033VVJSK|4|Liked as much as the shampoo of the same name. Would buy again!
B0043TXGZ0|4|This lipstick was pretty nice. Its comes on like a nude sand color. However, I do have to apply several layers for the color to actually become vivid on my lip. It feels a little sticky on your lips, kinda like lip gloss.
B0108UPK9C|5|I'm in love! This powder is amazing! I want more!
B007Z6IO82|5|It works but give it take sometime
B002612JK0|5|It's so great to be able to get Guerlain cosmetics in the US, and their lipsticks have always been the best. Rouge G de Guerlain is the newest in a long line of wonderful lipsticks. Goes on creamy with a hint of shine; stays on forever with no feathering or bleeding; is available a wide range of beautiful colors for day or evening. It even smells and tastes good, and to top it off, it's packaged in a solid, well-designed retro case that never, ever pops open in your bag. What's not to love?
B0000AFUT3|5|I love this mirror I can put my makeup on and make sure I don't put too much the only bad thing I have to say is I wish I could install the lights when they go out because this is my third time purchasing this type of mirror.
B0049LUI9O|5|I owned the high end Sharper Image to the cheapo no name brands and I actually own several differnet panasonic models over the last 10+ years, this one is up there with being the best, these will last you a couple of years(2)  depending on use, after that be prepared to buy a new one, they dull out and start pulling which can be extremely painful, but 15 bucks every other year is a small price to pay to not have to creep out folks and digust them with nose or ear hair dangling!
B0045WBFAI|4|Wow! Great product for thick, coarse hair! This is my first time using this product - I love the smell and consistency- not sticky and doesn't weigh my hair down!! Works great as treatment and daily use before using my flat iron.
B009GYVMAS|5|MONEY CAN BUY HAPPINESS! Not only does this have the cutest packaging but it did absolute wonders for my skin. As a 21 year old you don't expect acne to be a big problem in your life anymore, i've been on 6 different acne prescriptions. I'm currently on Epidoux and Doxycycline, which my dermatologist said would take about 3 months to work and i'm only on month #2. Obviously any average human doesn't want to hear that your skin still has yet to even remotely clear up for another 3 months. I came across GlamGlow on Pinterest and thought i would give it a try because the price and reviews were great. THANK GOD I DID! Within 2 days...yes 2 days my face was completely clear, 100% no foundation needed NOTHING! I suffer with acne very badly on my chin, nose and t-zone/mid forehead area. Poof...GONE! I do have a few dark spots that I see diminishing from the use of this mask. The container is smaller but i've used the mask fully on my face 4 times and now just using it for spot treat so it's going to last me awhile. I had read some reviews that some people's packages came used or damaged, i didn't have the problem at all. Everything about this is wonderful. If you're reading this, BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT! xoxoxox!
B0000Y3LAC|5|I use this to keep my compression socks from sliding down my leg. It works perfectly. It is water soluble. Highly recommend.
B0009OAI8Q|4|wife likes it
B007P9ZKWC|4|Works fine.  No concerns.
B003YJ70NY|4|It's less aggressive than what I really need, but does do the job with repeated swipes. The positive side to that is that you'd really have to make a special effort to cut yourself.
B004S3RA5I|4|Product satisfactory, but overpriced
B000HCZ34E|4|This is one of the best blades on the market.  They are slowly replacing them with more blades.  STOP! It's too much.  There are guys out there, like me, where 2 blades are perfect.      I only gave it 4 stars because for some strange reason it came with a 3 blade razor attached to the body.  But, when I looked at the extra 2 razors in the back, they had only 2 blades.  Unbelievable.
B00JRGQ09S|5|I have tried a many of products and none can beat this. I am 59 and had been working outdoors sence I have been 18. With that many years working in the sun with no sun screen I ended up with major sun spots. The One has lightened it up more than 3/4 with the first bottle. I will be needing to buy another bottle to continue to make it lighter. I have tried many other products with just a little result. So, this is, by me the best.
B005MJ5UHW|5|I love this stuff so much !!! It smells wonderful, not messy. Gives skin that summer glow !!!!
B000GAOMDA|5|I love these. Work great at catching stray hairs and the mirror magnifies nicely.
B004OHQR1Q|5|surprisingly nice set of marblezing dot pens  I was able to use them comfortably will be returning to buy more items
B003U30LSA|3|Not a big fan.  It is what it claims but I am just not crazy about the scent.  I also felt it dried my skin out a bit after a soak more so than other bubble baths. My kids like it but I won't be using it again myself.
B0073B3CY0|5|We had to give our White Maltese Dog, Matty, a Puppy Cut because his fur would become Knotted and tangled when we used Dog Shampoo. I bought Pantene Ice for my self but it was too heavy, shiny and limp. So I tried it on Matty, His fur was silky & shiny just like a Show Dog, and he brushed out tangle free.<br />[[ASIN:B0073B3CY0 Conditioner, 25.4 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)]].<br />[[ASIN:B004AGZLMM Pantene Pro-V Ice Shine (Ultime Brillance) Shampoo, LARGE 22.8 Oz.]]<br /><br />Now we only trim his feet, legs and belly, the rest of him just Glows and Flows. I use the Pantene Ice Shampoo and Conditioner on Matty, and Dog Shampoo on our Yorkie. You can't buy Ice Shine Conditioner and Shampoo in the Stores anymore and Pantene says they discontinued it, that was several years ago, but I can still buy it on line at Amazon. Burrs and Stickers and Pine Needles comb right out without Pulling out or cutting the fur. Highly Reccommend for Dogs with Tangled fur Issues.
B00U6LD4QA|5|This is the only one one ordered if anymore my mistakeI have also numbers on my to push it twice I didn't mean to
B00BAYHP8A|5|only place where price is right, shipments are good<br />looking for this color for a while.<br />great looking with the light coat
B005UL3LVY|5|Colors are true to the sticker on the bottom and great colors, even if some were too dark for me!
B0006GDATQ|5|As a mechanic my hands are constantly exposed to harsh hand cleaners, this lotion is great for very dry skin and industrial exposure.
B00DU6ZV28|4|I've been using a Braun 7 series shaver for quite some time and have been very happy with it, so I was excited to try out the new Braun Cool Tec shaver.<br /><br />First thing I noticed out of the box, is that the Cool Tec is bulkier than the 7 series.  It's still substantial as far as weight goes but the overall quality does seem like a step backwards.  Ergonomically, it fit well in my hands though, so it does feel like I have good control when maneuvering the shaver around my face, chin, and neck.<br /><br />The quality of the shave is good.  It takes a few more passes than the 7 series which is understandable since the motor on the Cool Tec isn't as strong.  The non-swiveling head also took some time to get used to since getting around some of the curves and angles takes a bit more work.  I consider myself having a medium coarse beard and the Cool Tec cut through the hair effectively.  My skin is only mildly sensitive so irritation with the Cool Tec has never been an issue.<br /><br />There is a push up trimmer/edger that works as expected.  It trimmed my sideburns and the edge of my mustache easily.  My one complaint about this is the trimming blade is too narrow for my liking.<br /><br />The cooling feature on this shaver does seem gimmicky at first, but I have to admit it is a pretty &#34;cool&#34; feature.  There is a thin bar between the two shaving foils that feels cool on your skin as you're shaving.  Since my skin is not very prone to irritation, I'm not sure how helpful this is in that regard but it seems like it would help with sensitive skin.<br /><br />Overall, my 7 series shaver is easier to use and not as bulky feeling as the Cool Tec but the 7 series is more expensive.  At this price point, I think this shaver is a worthwhile purchase.
B004H8XVMU|3|its ok
B0076372TQ|5|I love this fragrance, it is just right.The only down fall is scent doesn't last all day, nevertheless  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00BWU7MNU|4|One side of the tube written in English are the instructions. Other side is Russian. The jury is still out. I should now better in a month or two. If it's good I will buy again
B007BY3S52|5|I have been looking for this brush for awhile now. It is the best edge brush ever made. Just to explain a little.  The brush is used exactly for that your edges. It makes a very nice neat ponytail with a spectacular smooth edge effect.
B000GZBWGK|5|If you add only one beauty item to your daily regimen, this should be it. It's a spa treatment in itself.
B0050NWCQ2|5|i love this traincase. it. holds. EVERYTHING. &#60;3
B001FB5O7M|5|It's a good alternative to smearing yourself with mystery chemicals and smelling like cheap perfume.    The stuff just works. These days, that alone is worth 5 stars.
B00AFI6N9E|5|I have used Cushion Grip for many years, it is the best thing I have found to keep my lower plate usable.  Hope you keep it on hand.<br />forever...
B000N2JYN4|3|Smooth and quiet. Only  2 speeds and heat settings. Just didn't care for the dryer at all.
B00QJETI72|3|Hello everyone. I'll probably be the only one or just a few to say this and loose out on my &#34;freebie&#34; but I don't care because how can you write an honest review for people if it's based on only getting something for FREE??? First of all I have to start of by saying they named this a serum and in my eyes and head a &#34;serum&#34; has at least a bit of substance and isn't runny. Well this is like water and drips through your fingers when dispensing it! That was my main detemining factor for purchasing this product because it was called a serum... along with the combination of vitamin C and hyaluronic acid (nice combo). I do have to say though that I &#34;lovve&#34; the pump dispenser — easier to control than the dropper ones. Great design!! Also, I'm sure you seasoned vitamin C users will agree with me... all vitamin C products have an odd smell after they're on your face. I don't think this will ever change. Perhaps that's a good thing being indicative of their performance? So far so good though. I'm in my fifth decade and I always get compliments on my skin. This is something that I've added to my repetoire for now until it's finished so I'll give it a three star for it's work and price but not a 5 star for it' water-like substance and odor. Still looking for that one that is a true &#34;SERUM&#34; though — haven't found it yet and I don't know if it exists???
B005HO0A1S|5|Ups messed up an now its a refund
B000ILZKZG|5|Keri is no longer carried in my local stores. I have tried several other bath body  lotions and have not been happy. They are either too oily, have a strong scent, or leave a sticky feeling to my skin.    I have used Keri bath oil for over thirty years. It is great after coming from a pool with harsh chemicals or in the winter when my skin is dry. Keri always makes my skin feel good.I was very happy to find it on Amazon.    Thanks
B0009V1YS2|1|Terrible, seems to be a knock off or something.  Terrible, seems to be a knock off or something.  Broke after a few months of usage.  Seemed to not be the real thing.
B00CPPGGPQ|4|As expected.
B006FKLRIS|1|Designer skin DOES NOT sell their products online. They carry their products solely in certified salons. Sure you can chance buying this product because maybe some salon is selling it as a clearance item but sometimes these bottles are used and then replaced with part real lotion and part some other generic lotion. Don't be fooled by the super low prices online. PROTECT yourself and buy from your local salon.<br />Not to mention purchasing from your local salon will help keep it in business since you're working so hard and paying so much money to achieve your dark tan.<br />You wont be able to keep tanning if your salon goes out of business because everyone is buying lotion online when it isn't even the real deal.<br />Also non-certified tanning lotions damage the acrylics on tanning beds; causing them to fog up and you won't be getting as dark plus ruining everyone else's tanning experience plus costing the salon's more money to replace the acrylic. This goes for all tanning lotions sold online not just the moisturizers. You're just harming yourself using this stuff. If you're too cheap to put in a few extra dollars for the real deal you're better off using crappy lotion from the drug store, better for your skin than buying \\"salon\\" lotions online.
B005DKKBP6|5|This shaver is the best that I have ever had!!! It makes way less noise than most of the other electric shavers that I have ever had. You get a very close shave without much, hitting the same spot again and again like some other shavers that I have had. Only one minor complaint. The cleaning system is a little louder than it needs to be and part of this is the beeping it makes through most of the cycle. Otherwise the BEST shaver I have ever had!!
B00770JW9Q|5|The top and base coat are wonderful! I love the way my nails look now that I know how to do them
B00MBPFKKM|4|works great
B00GF9ZBJA|4|I like it!!
B00IFWGGJE|1|it dos not work well at all, i am very disappointed  in the product
B00AMMZ8EE|5|Have used this line for years.  Last for months.l
B008KEMB9G|3|I use them on my dogs nails after they are trimmed.  They are a bit rough, and wear down fairly quickly.  I go through one per dog each time.
B00AAJOZN4|5|Just like I expected.
B002UKP1SY|1|does not heat up well at all!  do not buy!!!!  waste of money!!  I would give it 0 stars if I could!
B008EXO8NU|3|I made a mistake and ordered the wrong Kerastase shampoo.<br />However, even as the wrong product it is still a much better<br />shampoo than anything you can purchase at a retail store.
B00H7NKNE6|5|Excellent product!  I am glad I ordered 2 of them as it is very useful especially I live in the midwest, weather here is quite harsh for my skin, it also helps my grey hair..........I am also thankful for Dr. Oz  TV Show I wouldn't even know what Argan Oil is all about...
B00KXFD75M|5|I love this product! it has reduced my acne scars and has reduced acne for me. I approve this product and guarantee it provides results - Erik :)
B0049WB4FU|5|This is my favorite Crabtree and Evelyn scent.  I bought it to reward myself for a large weight loss.  Price was better than any I have found.  It was well-packaged and arrived on time.
B00H61SZ4Y|5|This is a beautiful, well made purse....last minute Christmas gift...was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it was shipped and at my door.  If you have an adult Hello Kitty fan this is the perfect gift.  Great product...great service!
B001399LNY|5|I have used this same hot brush for years and have always used one.  The last one I used quit heating up, I tried to order one from a local beauty supply place but kept being told that she would check on the order.  I went on line, found the one I wanted, ordered it and had it within 3 days.  I am extremely happy and will probably order another one before the end of the year.  I will probably order more things from amazon.  Thanks for the great customer service.
B0009VNI90|3|I recently purchased this as I have used it in the past and the smell was very intoxicating.  I have used this several time and it was my absolute favorite and go to gel but now after purchasing it again it's not the same.  Threw it out after using it the one time I purchased it recently.  It had a chemical smell I did not like and was not able to cover up or get rid of.  Will not be buying this again.
B000FJ2I2O|1|It has a perfect battery but it doesn't remove hair well
B008XKBW4M|4|excelente!! producto
B006WEHHHM|3|The boar bristles are what I expected but the nylon bristles are way too soft to brush completely through my thick hair. This brush is advertised for thick hair which it can't fully brush through.
B007OT1XWE|5|Love it
B00M1E5F1W|5|Really good upgrade to a nice electric razor.
B00D58J8HU|5|This is wonderful moisture cream..I have tried  a variety over the years and find this helpful for my mature skin.It helps my make up to be applied with ease.
B0006ZTEQK|5|It is smooth and nice
B00B0S7KUY|4|You need patience ...and a high tolerance of pain in the beginning! I had to start at the lowest level for the first two weeks because I could NOT tolerate the pain, which is a sting/burn/intense pinch!! And I thought I could tolerate pain (I have mid-size tattoos on my back at the most boniest parts, so I thought hair removal would be a piece of cake! Boy was I in for a rude awakening)!! I purchased the TRIA mainly for my upper lip, underarms, and legs. I've used it weekly on my legs (knees and below) and sparingly on my underarms since purchasing it in mid-January (it's been approx 10 weeks now). I definitely notice the hair on my legs growing at a MUCH slower pace than when I shaved it. BUT I'm only up to the fourth level (out of five levels) and am feeling a little pain. Maybe next week I'll try it at the fifth level :/<br /><br />I'm at the third level on my underarms but admit I don't use it weekly. I do, however, notice less hair growth in that area though. I TRIED to use it in my bikini area and I can't even tolerate it on the first level!! I don't understand how women can tolerate the pain in this area...I zapped it twice and then never attempted to go near that area again :( .<br /><br />Overall, I'm giving it four stars because I have seen a difference in slow hair growth over time. I hope by June I'll be 'hairless' on my lower legs. I've read other reviewers who also experienced pain and others suggested to try numbing the area with ice (dry area before zapping) or numb it with numbing cream. I'll have to look into these suggestions and give it a try.
B00L2MFLPO|5|I keep the white one in my shower and use my normal shower gel on it for my face then use the black one once i get out for blackhead removal.
B00CHMWAY8|5|This stuff is good quality, starts to melt in your hand but solid at room temperature.  Works great at moisturizing toddler skin that seems not to do well with other moisturizers.
B001KYPZ4G|3|One thing I noticed was that this doesn't remove the hair from the root. It will burn the hair out and I had some issues with chemical burns in sensitive areas but that's more of my own fault and not the product.
B006HMWB4I|5|I bought this for my daughter because she has very sensitive, acne rosacea skin.  My daughter also has severe dry skin caused by the birth control pill (YAZ type pills) so she quit using this for the time being until her body gets back to normal because tea tree oil can be a little bit drying.  I would definitely give this product a try. I always like to support organic/vegan products.
B00006ANDQ|5|There is no better toothbrush than this.  It does the job and last longer then others too.
B006VDXFYS|5|Thinking I was in a rut after finding out that Alterna Hemp Concrete was discontinued, I started to look for alternatives. After unsuccessfully trying a couple of others, I luckily came across the bamboo product line. This is exactly like the hemp concrete that I've used for ages, just hope now that they don't discontinue this one!<br /><br />Only gripe is that I'd like this product to be Amazon Prime eligible, and possibly \\"subscribe and save\\" as well.<br /><br />EDIT: when I first purchased this, it was through Price Pros and I had to pay extra for shipping. Looks like now it is fulfilled through Amazon so Amazon Prime is available.
B000PVUAJU|4|I have use this lotion a few times now and overall I like and would buy again. The con for this lotion is how thick it is and I also have a hard getting it out the bottle. I feel that company should work on the bottle for this particular lotion cause it shouldn't be this hard to get the lotion out.
B00021B9O8|5|I have this product in Trompe-L'oeil, Rayon Vert, and Parme Etincelant.  I love them!  They're very iridescent, which makes for a cool effect, and they layer well.  It's really easy to use just a sheer wash or build up the color for a bolder look.  They have a bit of sparkle, but they are not overly glittery, so they're appropriate for all kinds of situations.  Sometimes I use Trompe-L'oeil as a highlight.<br /><br />Some people mention having trouble with the brushes and container.  I think the brushes are fine, I've never had any problem with them whatsoever.  As for the container, I like it because it minimizes waste by not overloading the brush.  If you don't get enough, just stick the brush back in, shake the container a little, and you're good to go.  If you really get annoyed with it, it is possible to pry off the bottom and transfer the contents to another container.<br /><br />I intend to buy several more colors.
B006MD1PBC|3|I was excited to try this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel that I got free from Secret through BzzAgent.  I have been disappointed in its inability to stop me from sweating, though.<br />It really does keep my clothes stain-free (no white marks), but, like EVERY deodorant/antiperspirant I have ever tried, it falls short in not making my have sweaty armpits.<br />That is not to say that I treat my deodorant nicely….I mean, I push my sweating to the limits.  I took 3-year-old twins to Yo Gabba Gabba Live, worked out, did an oral presentation for my grad school class, etc. under the care of secret.  All of those things made me super-sweaty.<br />I have to say, i was kind of disappointed when I received my BzzKit and saw that this was a GEL.  I mean, who wants to put wet stuff on their pits?!?!  The directions said to apply 2-3 &#34;clicks&#34; to each underarm.  I find that I need to use 4 clicks on the first armpit (from settling or something?) and only 1 on the second armpit.  Weird, but true.  The gel takes a while to dry, but, when it does, it really leaves no marks.<br />The scent is fresh and clean.  It is a little strong, but I like that.  I haven't had body odor since using it, but, like I mentioned, i still do sweat….a LOT.
B00LC8E9T2|5|THESE ARE GREAT ...PUT ONE OR TWO IN EVERY SINGLE BAG ....GREAT FOR WHEN ONE CANT BRUSH TEETH!!!!
B00889F0ZK|3|This product was order by my wife. It works great, light changes color blows out stems but the steam is not hot. It is a well built product that seems like it will hold up over time. I rated it three stars because I hate the smells that come out of this thing. It smells like a flower is having  diarrhea inside and it is being blown through the room. It does what it's supposed to I just don't like it.
B002VUAJXK|5|But if you think orange peel you could be ok ... I hate licorice .. does a wonderful job.. different from american toothpastes...
B00M1NMY76|5|great quality!
B000VV21U0|5|good
B002VA4LNO|5|Amazon rocks!  I have purchased millions of items on Amazon and have never left a review until now.  I LOVE this Pond's product and I received it only yesterday!      It has a luxurious silky fee to it along with a lovely, but not overpowering, fragrance.  It immediately absorbs into the skin without leaving a sticky or greasy film.  I couldn't wait to try it so I rubbed a dab of it on a small spot on the back of my hand and I swear, I saw an immediate improvement in the size and color of the dark spot!  It might be all in my head, but after applying to my face and neck before going to bed last night, this morning the dark spots seemed lighter.  I've tried two products before this Pond's product and didn't see any real improvement after months of usage.  Nuetrogena corrector did nothing after using 4-5 tubes and Roc seemed to make the spots darker for some reason.  Another added bonus of this product is that it makes a great base for your makeup.    Try this if you are looking for something for your dark spots and/or uneven skin tone!  You'll be pleasantly surprised just like I am.  Did I say I just love it?
B0070TSNSA|5|Love, love, love Everyone Lotion!!!!
B007EDFV9Q|5|this product makes your scalp tingle in a way that says &#34;I&#34;m working!&#34; and it has made some difference in lessening the thinning of my hair.
B003JM4OCG|3|It was smaller than the ones I got last time but, other than that it was good. I'm just happy to find Max Factor Panstik
B003KNQPGM|5|This is a thick cream great for everyday use. The smell is fantastic and I would highly recommend it. Not greasy at all.
B00BB8ZHIU|5|excelente producto
B00ILZVV5E|5|After trying on so many headbands at different stores, I finally decided to risk it and order one online. They are always too big and loose, but this one fits me perfect! It has a lot of elastic in it and is made out of a really nice material. LOVE the color, too. I am so happy with this order!
B00CRKKEP2|5|Love the smell, longevity of the smell and price.  On my third purchase of the is style.
B002HMYF8W|5|Amazing
B001FB5LWU|5|Great deal
B006PEL7A2|3|Same as every other Nair product. .. stilll make skin bumpy
B0001UFPD6|2|no affect
B003COAFPQ|5|Best oil ever!
B00I4UQ55W|5|Ive only used it once: but it was sharp as expected, love the little design,  and look forward to future uses.  (I just use it to cut my own hair). It  came in the mail on time.
B0019Z9SIK|4|good as bronzer or contouring powder.Very natural,good supstitute for bronzer on light skins(my openion),I am medium skin tone,and loved it on sides of the nose,cheeck hollow.I gave it 4 stars because the cartoon box was little damaged.
B001ENB8H6|2|I don't like the way these feel on my face.  They're kind of a scratchy foam-ish material.  I can't attest to their lifespan, because I chose to not use them after a few tries.  They do look cute though.
B0079R6BD2|4|I think this product works very well. It has a good smell and seems to help my hair stay thick; however, it is not a silver bullet for hair loss. I think people buy this product expecting it to manically grow their hair back and then give it a poor rating when it doesn't. That always frustrates me as I don't feel it is fair to give a product a negative review because the reviewer lacks common sense. If you think you are buying a silver bullet to reverse the genetic hair loss you are suffering from, I have some swampland in Florida that I want to sell you...and at a good price! :)<br /><br />Bottom line, this probably won't make a huge difference in your hair loss but it probably does slow down the process if you are losing hair from harsh ingredients in other shampoos or if you have excess DHT in your scalp. Nothing that you will be able to notice in any short period of time but if the product does gain you an extra six months of hair in your lifetime, and cleans your hair with natural ingredients during the process, it's probably worth the cost...at least it is to me.
B00LAATC2Q|3|It was too light.
B00VXEQ0WO|5|I GOT THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOISTURIZERS THAT I HAVE EVER USED.  IT ABSORBS QUICKLY AND DOESN'T LEAVE MY FACE FEELING GREASY.  I STARTED USING THIS AROUND MY MOUTH TO START WITH.  I STARTED SEEING THE LINES LIGHTENING UP, SO NOW I USE IT ALL OVER MY FACE.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B002TPQPEE|4|Delivery was bad! It got delivered to the wrong apt and we had to track it down.   It wasn't like UPS or FEDX it was an unknown company.   Product is awesome! Colors are lovely! You just put on a little and it looks pretty. Not like other eyeshadows that u have to keep putting some on to show the color you want.   These Colors are hard to find and im glad I ordered them. Love it!
B0032A0Z78|5|I absolutely love this lotion.  It's a bit sticky when you first put it on but give it a chance to absorb.  It lasts for a long time, even after washing you hands.
B000YFVO2E|5|they have this at my nail salon but it costs more there!!..I think this is very good.....like the way it smells and it really helps dry skin.
B0000ZLEJG|1|I found that the scent was not so strong as one would expect from a scented oil product, but the real problem was that wherever I touched it to my body, I started itching and developed a rash at the site of application. There's no place on their web site to ask about what the base oil is, and the phone number on the bottle just gives you a phone tree with options to buy more. Lesson learned.
B00LKSVFI2|5|Just what I wanted and needed.  attractive...works well and has nice weighted base which makes it very secure.
B009RNUH7C|5|I have very dry skin and haven't been able to moisturize my back until I found this great spray with Aloe.
B009NQKKMU|4|The case is a little cheap feeling and doesn't close well but for the price it's a great purchase
B00FRD87C8|5|Super Fantastic Dye.. I have been using this product for 6 months, and have touched it up 3 times now, the 3rd only at the roots due to growth. The first time I used the Purple Passion I dyed my mousy brown hair with no lighter, it came out pretty bright. The second time I lightened my hair with a platinum dye from the drug store, turning my hair blonde. I used the Purple Passion again that time, it was the most incredibly deep bright purple. I've since then just touched it up at the roots, the purple in my length is still super bright. None of the times I have used Sparks has it damaged my hair, it finishes silky smooth. I am complimented daily on the color of my hair, and asked what product I use.<br /><br />Some of the negative comments are true, but I feel I must clarify since I have dyed my hair with everything out there. Provana...Manic Panic....Raw...Color Jam the list goes on....they are far less effective compared to Sparks.<br />* I have a nose for smell, so I have been told. Sparks has a very nice fragrance, there is nothing overpowering about the smell.<br />* Yes, it dyes your skin I've found using vasoline around my hair line, neck, and ears takes care of that.<br />* HUGE TIP HERE... The dye will stick and only wash out for about six washes if you wash your hair with cold water, hot water draws the color out...Shampoo as little as possible, but condition well....<br />* Yes it will dye the shower, nothing that Tilex mildew remover won't get rid of in 5 min. The more you rinse with cold water the less this happens.<br />* Wrap your hair in an old t-shirt the first few night this will prevent stains on your pillow.<br /><br />All in all this is the best dye around in my opinion when your goal is fun, bright, funky coloring.....Sparks is best in..quality, cost,and effectiveness....<br /><br />Hope this helps....
B005JLC012|4|One of my least favorite of the bombshell line, it just has a sent that something is missing and you can tell
B003FBNNNC|5|I have used this particular hand cleaner for years.  Found it on Amazon so I will continue to buy it here.  My husband does not like the frilly smelly but this is just a citrus fragrance.  He even loves this one.
B00070PNIM|5|I have very fine long highlighted curly hair and a ton of it. I like my hair to be straight.  This brush just shaved 15mins off my blow-dry.  It didn't pull out as much as other brushes and I was able to blow-dry a larger section.  This is a great brush.
B000NLJFNY|2|I can't really write an accurate review because I only tried it twice. & Out of those time it left my hair so UNBELIEVABLY DRY . I cannot explain how dry my hair was after wards. It felt like I just bleached my hair I COULD not run my fingers thru my hair at all. It was like that for days not even a hydrating hair masks would help AT ALL. Maybe if I was a natural hair color I would've seen some growth thru the month but I just couldn't put my hair thru it anymore. I had read mamy reviews saying the same thing but decided to take the risk.
B002TO3MR8|5|Love the Hot Tools brand! Good service through Amazon! Would buy this again when necessary!!
B00H2MFRKC|5|My Wife loves it!
B000KEIPC6|5|Good product. Cheaper here then in stores
B002BS2U0M|3|I didn't see any difference
B008HOFLWS|1|I ordered a mixed length of 20,22,24 inch hair when I received it it smell like it had been in a warehouse for years .. After getting it installed for which I paid an addition $150 one week late I had to get it cut out because as soon as it got wet the hair immediately tangled up.the curls do not stay in tack and there customer service after asking me to remove my first review was terrible
B00FBXJ11K|5|The item took a very long time to arrive but when it did it is even prettier in person than pictured.
B0095IMNI0|5|Is an excellent buy!
B001NFS4HW|5|Much better than shoving your fingers into your mouth to try and remove your liners.  They work just like they described.
B00OQU28DC|5|If your looking for something to take away any dry, flaking, tight winter skin, then this is the product. smells great with that hint of cranberry.
B00L38ON60|5|Very nice
B001G7R41O|5|I have tried every brand imaginable, from drugstore, to department store to beauty store.  My daughter has acne, I have combination skin and this soap takes care of both. I usually don't even bother with bar soap, but I took the reviews and recommendations and glad I did! Love this stuff!
B00ORSUTZC|5|Upon opening the box, there was a chemical scent, it didn't bother me much and diminished significantly after having it out a bit. I washed the brushes before using them and let the case set overnight, by morning the smell was completely gone. The brushes arrived in perfect condition (with the exclusion of the fan brush, which was a little rough looking but easily repaired). They are well made, no shedding or loose tops. I am truly impressed with the amazing quality, they are soft, but sturdy.<br />Makeup application is a breeze, they don't hold excess product, which would then require you to wash between each application. These brushes are fabulous with distributing product in a simple swipe. The eyeshadow brush seems to apply color much better than my previous brushes; the color actually comes off of the brush and onto your lid without having to apply over and over. I did a test with Petunia Skincare's eyeshadow brush vs. another like brush, the results were much better with Petunia Skincare. After use, I brushed each on a towel...So much product came off the other brush, I wondered how any even made it to my eye lid; Petunia Skincare's brush had none.<br />All in all, these brushes are fantastic and I am elated to own them. The coloring of the brushes is gorgeous and attractive. The carrying case is simple to roll and easy to lay flat for ease of use. I will use these till there's nothing left of them!<br /><br />**I received Petunia Skincare's 12 Set Makeup Brush Kit free for review. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.**
B000143C0K|1|I really don't like this trimmer.  Its not smooth.  Just doesn't get the job done.  Want to return it !!!!!!
B00IHPJKCO|4|Overall a great sunscreen. The texture is rather runny and milky, so applying the full 1/4th tsp isn't too much of a hassle. It takes about 2-3 minutes for it to dry from almost a milk-like mask onto your face into a powdery matte. If you're fair-skinned, you'll probably notice little to no white cast. If you do notice a slight white cast, wait about 2 more minutes after its matte and rub/pat it in a little more. It's also irritation-free and can be applied on/around eye area with little to no problem.
B007IUPZJG|1|Did absolutely nothing to sustain hairstyle!  Would not recommend
B00TGQWFH0|3|I think I need to get used to it but it works.
B005FAAX0M|2|Picture gives the impression that these two soaps come as one gift box. They don't! Bought multiples of these as office Christmas gifts, but when they arrived as individual bars, I had to rebundle to make a better gift. Also soaps are not worth the price. They are clear colored & do not smell like very much.
B004IT2V6K|5|I have this palette for about 2 months now, and totally love it.   I mainly use eyeshadows and bronzer/blush. The quality and color of eyeshadows are outstanding, especially for this price. They are vibrant and long lasting, and blend easily.  Also the blush in a right upper corner is beautiful, just a tiny bit gives natural looking rosy cheeks. Bronzer is subtle with a little bit shimmer in it which transfer to skin as a glow.  Occasionally I use lip gloss and they are ok, not the best ones, but not the worse. The color is not as vibrant on the lips, but I like more natural look.  I didn't use the brushes, I have regular size ones I like. But when travelling they might be helpful. Although it probably takes a bit of practice with small and not great quality brushes to work with them.  Also there is a little mirror along the case (inside on the lid), very helpful.  Overall great buy, with nice color selection! I used to have a bigger Sephora palette and there was a lot of the same or similar colors, this one is smaller but I use it everyday. The eyeshadows come in matte and shimmer version so there is enough options for many looks.
B003ATS2QC|5|Great scale. Spot on with my doctor's office
B0054Y0FAW|3|Like most chemical dyes this caused burns to my scalp! :( owch going back to henna glazing However, everyone if you have never had an allergy to chem dyes this is a really really nice product :D
B003UBK5II|5|Just what I was looking for!
B000ZV5SLK|4|This plate helps you achieve perfect half moon shape when stamping your nails With this you can do a quick and easy like-french manicure. Plate is easy to clean and handle.
B000GHWSG6|5|My woman love this.
B00MLQ4AEI|5|I love this thing I just wish the packaging was in English it's ok though the product works great
B00840W3JO|5|I purchased Dettol Cool Soap New Improved Fragrance 120gm because it was the only option available for an antibacterial soap at our little corner store. This menthol soap lathers up very well, smells refreshing, feels clean and rinses off easily.
B006YBC6HY|5|I use it for shaving, terrific product!
B004MLXQ54|5|This is a must for large shampoo and conditioner bottles. I have used this pump on 3 different bottles. Great purchase.
B000GFZWDO|5|I was having problems finding this product in any retail stores including salons.  I have always loved this product and have used it for 20 years. It is especially good on curly and coarse hair like mine.  Put it on toweled dried hair for at least 1/2 hour or overnight then wash out and style as usual.  Hair is soft, shiny and manageable.  I hope Amazon always carries it!
B00WEAAI9C|1|Super thin and not as pictured. I forgot to take an image but you could see the wig cap through the hair to the point you couldn't even style it to where it wouldn't show.
B0043AS76C|5|Product came in just a couple days, and is wonderful.  Good for when you need a little touch up during the day.  Highly recommended!
B001E0X4RG|5|This product really works. It is better than anything I have found.
B001JQLNH8|5|best shaver for a disposable.
B0012QM51I|5|BEST NIGHT CREAM EVER!  I have searched for years to find a light weight, fragrance free night cream, and LOVE this cream. It is the ONLY cream that doesn't make my sensitive skin break out. I can also wear under makeup during the day, because it is so light weight.
B000HQ0L2E|5|I've tried a few similar products, and this is the only one that gets the job done. Now my back is no problem. Love it.
B0094GHHO8|4|I often feel like my life is a search for the perfect mascara. I want a no-clump mascara that doesn't bother my eyes and is easy to remove. This one comes pretty darn close to perfect.<br /><br />It goes on very smoothly and I haven't had a clump yet. My eyes don't seem to be allergic. And it comes off like a dream. My lashes look good, although not quite as thick as the clumpier kinds of mascara.<br /><br />The main reason I didn't give 5 stars is, I feel like I have to put on 2 or 3 coats for my lashes to look thick at all. And I have a terrible time getting my lower lashes to show up. It takes me longer to put on this mascara than other ones like L'Oreal Volumizer and Cover GIrl Professional Mascara, which seem to show up nice and thick right away. But those bother my eyes.<br /><br />That said, I would recommend this mascara. I will buy it again.
B000NW87VY|3|i thought it was clear but it is a blue unsatisfied
B00DTTYF6E|5|Great product... felt great on my skin !  Not a strong scent.  Would purchase again !
B003B6JWV8|4|I have neer found a concealer that TOTALLY CONCEALS!!  And this one is no exception.  BUT...it does a better job than ANY others I've tried.  The big secret is not to use too much.  It only takes a tiny bit to conceal any discoloration, red spot, flat mole, dark-under-eye circles, etc.  (I haven't used it on any area other than my face,)  When I first tried it, I used too much, and it flaked off; but when I used just enough to cover what I wanted to cover, it worked great.  It doesn't sink into my pores but makes them less visible, which is a big plus.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that is doesn't come with a sharpener.  After several purchases, I found one that sort of works; but if anyone out there knows of one that really works, let me know!!
B0045XWORK|5|I bought these for my son because he does tattoos and he likes this very much. Says they work well and he would recommend them all for anyone who does tattoos and he will be back to get more.
B008YCTYNU|3|okay so, this wig was a bit on the thinner side but because of the type of net that it had you couldnt tell at all and it looks natural, the hair is realistic looking and very soft but its a bit nappy at the ends (but that can totally be fixed with the boiling method or a straightner) sadly i cant wear it because the cap is so small but i got this to cut the wefts from and add them to a different wig anyways so, this wig is perfect if you know how to style it and you have a smaller sized head
B001DYM5J6|5|items met expectations for sure!!
B00GOXV6VY|5|love it best price best product the tanning salons rip you off! this was amazing
B000GHWUQ4|5|very good
B003ZVYQRY|1|Reminds me of the poor scents sold in the 99 cent store or should I say 59 cent store. I often wondered what in the world cheap deodorant woman were wearing in NYC and now I know. Don't waste your money on this junk, because thats what it is !<br />You been warned. It should cost 25 cents at most.....and used to oil a squeaky door hinge.
B00IMPUTGU|5|Arrived when expected - great product!
B00C29I14E|2|Sadly for me, this lipstick was a dud - it was NOT worth the price. If I had bought it at a retailer and/or at retail price, I would have returned it. The color is a pretty shade of mauve and the formula feels moisturizing, BUT the tube I purchased had no iridescent effect nor did the color last. I have worn it alone & even tried wearing it over/under other lipsticks. I applied it on pre-moisturized lips and without using moisturizer. However, the product faded away after an hour or so (I did not eat/drink anything).  It had to be reapplied several times throughout the day if I wanted color, which meant I had to either constantly reach into my purse to get it or have a pocket handy to carry it in - GRRR!  A tinted Chapstick would probably perform just as well or better... for much le$$!<br />On a good note, the package arrived a day earlier than expected.
B00BDJVNYO|5|Love it!! I bought this flat iron from the mall year ago and broke it in a move. I repurchased it on amazon and it came to me two days later on perfect condition. I will never use any thing else. This is the best. I love love love it!!!
B000MFKU12|5|LOVE LOVE LOVED this gum but the company has stopped making it :(<br />I have researched and cannot find anywhere
B00F3JF3CS|5|Worked wonders on my episiotomy after having my son!! MUCH better answer than pills, as I am nursing.  There seems to be a topical pain relief in this product.
B001E96NYS|5|It's always worked just right for me
B0007MW2ZW|5|First time using a brush and shave cream. Decided on this from the reviews and would buy again. Using it with the Escali badger hair brush and works up great.
B00I3VHKVK|2|Wooden handle breaks easily
B0019I83N8|5|Finally a cleanser that doesn't over dry my skin or make it flaky. Love the refreshing feeling and the smell in the morning.
B00AXZ027S|4|This product helped with my under eye wrinkles that accumulated from long sleepless nights in college. I'm happy with the results- my eye wrinkles started to fade after daily usage for a week. A friend recommended this product to me, and I am so glad she did! If you suffer from under eye wrinkles, I would say definitely give this product a go.
B0087G827C|5|I think this product actually grows my hair.  I've been using it for about 2 months now and I've seen a big difference in the length and texture of my hair.  Would highly recommend.
B005XIDZHO|5|Works really good on upper lips.I got this yesterday only and tried. Good product. Quality wise too.I will recommend other.
B00SUWEZCO|5|Love it. Seen results in 2 days.
B00192QCMS|5|The gloves worked well for me.  My husband had burned his hands and was applying a medicated cream on his hands.  Insted of using the expensive guaze, the gloves were a good substitute.  The gloves can be used more than once and were machine washable. :)<br /><br />Wal-Green's price was $3.99 per glove.
B00U0X2T42|4|The Remington PF7400 F4 is pretty good and well-built for a basic, no-frills electric shaver. I have been using manual razors for as long as I can remember. Although the F4 doesn't shave as close as a manual razor (I didn't expect it would), it still gives me a nice and smooth shave. I particularly like the feel of it in my hand, well balanced and very easy to maneuver. The pop-up trimmer works great as well. It comes with a small brush, and it is easy to clean by rinsing the it under running water.<br /><br />As a basic shaver, the F4 uses a NiMH rechargeable cell that takes 16 hours to charge for about 40 minutes worth of run time, and there is no quick charge option. If you don't need a fancy shaver for heavy use, the F4 should suffice. For under $40, you get a basic but dependable shaver that costs a little more than a pack of premium manual razors. It's economical and a money saver in the long run. Great value for the money.
B0030GMBNK|5|What an excellent price for a great product. For this price, I could have bought two bars at the pharmacy. As for the soap, it has these neat little &#34;micro scrubbies&#34; in the bar which adds some grit to the bar. I like it because it helps get my skin real clean, it smells decent, and does not dry out my skin. I also like the other Dove for Men bar soaps, but this is my favorite.
B0049CEVRI|5|I am on my second pregnancy. The first pregnancy, I just used \\"regular\\" lotion like shea butter or cocoa butter. I got really bad stretch marks. This pregnancy, I have been using the Anti Stria lotion and my stretch marks are much less noticeable so far (at 31 weeks). It smells good and feels fabulous. I love it! It seems a little expensive at first, but I only use it when I take a shower and it has lasted a long time. Besides, if it actually helps tone down the stretch marks, it is completely worth it!
B005V6FQIO|5|MY  WIFE AN MOTHERLAW  LOVE IT  IT HELP THEM SLEEP MUCH BETTER, I WILL  BE STOCKING UP  ON THIS ITEMS FOR THE FUTURE
B004DMEXQS|3|This is my first time to try a Bic disposable razor, though I have tried other brands.  I like that most razors these days, including these Bic Soleil Bella, have a slide-on cover over the blades rather than a snap-on. With two children who use my shower and tend to knock things over, I know that they're less likely to injure themselves on my razors since the covers won't pop off.<br /><br />The handle is comfortable and has a no-slip grip for index finger and thumb. Also as with most razors, these also have the grooves to help lift the hairs for a closer shave. While it took only one swipe on my underarms rather than the usual two (though there wasn't much hair to begin with), I noticed that my legs felt stubbly by the end of the day.  But more significantly, I noticed a really weird, almost tingly feeling before nighttime that I have not experienced with previous razors. Two days later, the hair isn't very noticeable, but the stubble can be definitely be felt.  While the blade does have some rotation, I've used razors with more flexibility than this one.  Overall, this was not my favorite razor but I might be willing to give it another try.
B00CA51RQE|3|You get what you pay for. In this case, I should not have expected too much.Being somewhat flimsy, and I must agree with others....they are small. I have to position my hand perpendicular (/) with my middle finger up in a stitched corner. I have pretty small hands, yet these are still seriously awkward. While I enjoy using them on my face, body use is tedious and a lesson in futility. You have to finish bathing, then pat dry your skin after wetting and ringing out the cloth. To make any headway, you have to move the cloth in long back and forth strokes....and it still takes some decent pressure. By the time dead skin starts rolling off, the rest of your body has already air-dried. Thus, the futility. I don't have time to get in and out of water, pat dry, and hope that the next strip of skin gets exfoliated. Also, the use alone kills my arm for so little results. I will use them on my face, and buy a Baiden or another for body use.
B0052P11GK|1|I bought this with the intention of using it as a night time moisturizer. Really love Andalou Naturals, but not this product. I only tried it one night and woke up the next morning with two pimples. I also really dislike the smell (not that I wish it had fragrance or perfume in it). Way too expensive to use for a purpose other than what I intended. And when I went to return in, I was disappointed to learn that the company (merchant, not Andalou) doesn't take cosmetic returns. Waste of money.
B000VOP79O|5|Great fruity smell...!!! I love this product! I bought it for my Girlfriend and we both like it!
B000FGABJY|5|Got this for our son for his 5th birthday.  He loves it 'cause it's \\"just like Daddy's!\\"  Because it is so similar to my husband's watch, he had no trouble setting the time and date.  Even I was surprised at how easy it is to navigate.  One downside is that my son cannot yet read, so he has to just memorize which button does what, but that will soon enough be remedied.  Seems to be made very sturdy and durable.  Over all: well pleased with our purchase.
B001BSTGX2|4|Great for me. No issues at all. I have had this for years. A little overpriced, but that's the going rate I guess
B0041ERPPE|5|Convenient and effective
B00CBFFHQ4|5|Perfect little pony tail holders and can be used twice!! This is the best I've found on amazon
B0056TA0NM|4|This stuff works, but is rather tricky to apply, being very, very gooey!  The icecream-cup wood spoon is a bad choice as a mixer. I used a demitasse spoon and also applied the mixture with it. I found one pack sufficient for both uppers and lowers. It has been about a week now and looks like I'll have a add a b'it more to both which would incline me to subtract a star. But it could still be the best solution out there.
B000C21096|4|Nice perfume. I like it. Its got a very unique masculine smell to it. not fruity at all. totally recommended for all.
B000FGTTVU|1|Don't buy into the hype that because this is an Art of Shaving product it is \\"better\\".  Alum is a chemical that comes out of the ground, there are no magic elves living in an old oak tree  formulating alum blocks for The Art of Shaving. This same product, without the bling, can be purchased online (and in ethnic grocery stores) for as little as $6. Save your money, improve your shaving techniques so you have less need for styptic or alum.
B0096WARIS|5|This stuff is great! Helps with my candida.
B004NWO3EU|5|Just got back from 11 days in Hawaii where it was very hot and sunny.  I hit the pool and beach and spent a lot of time in the sun, and I am a ginger haired Irish gal, who is very fair skinned.  This product came highly recommended by an objective review website, so I decided to try it, and if didn't suffer even the lightest burn, so I am satisfied with the product.
B00OYEXE1U|5|Love these products. You won't be disappointed.
B008J4QPJ4|5|I like this fragrance from Vera Wang. When I wear it, everyone asked me what I am wearing.
B00A6YCGRU|5|This is the only lip gloss (or lip product) my wife has found that can use without allergic reactions. Of course, Almay has discontinued this product, so trying to find it (at a half way decent price!) has been like a scavenger hunt! Good stuff.
B00KAVCORQ|4|Shorter than I thought they were going to be, but they get the job done
B000Q37M5M|1|Cheap....Cheap....Cheap. Pretty colors but Cheaply made!!!
B000X2W616|5|Super pleased with the craftsmanship, easy installation, and overall design of this mirror.  A few people have left reviews stating that the light was not bright enough.  The light is actually just right for what the product is designed for, to be a makeup mirror.
B0095EIJ78|5|I found this product to be very helpful.  I love it.  It was  a Christmas gift last year, and I have continued to purchase it since then.
B0057JCYYE|5|Delivery, packaging and promptness was great! This is the perfect combo and size to try out for the first time the Gelish experience! I will soon be purchasing the full-size products. I'm very satisfied and will buy from this vendor again!
B004XJNQXW|4|These plates are not as detailed as the more expensive Konad plates, but they are wonderful nonetheless.  They are easy to work with and have a wide range of designs.  I particularly like this collection because it includes mostly full-nail designs instead of a smattering of single images.<br /><br />A couple of things:<br />The full images are small if you have deep nail beds, long nails, or bigger nails.<br />There are too many French tip designs.  I like the way Cheeky has put a curved end on full nail design to give you either option.
B00ARIAN98|2|It looks good and feels good, but when it come to styling I have a lot of hair that falls out. And I'm not talking about a few strands because that is expected but I mean like clumps of hair sometimes. It's a great deal but not a long term hair do. Maybe something quick for prom or something like that.
B00AWSMY8Q|5|This peel makes a visible difference.  At 60 I still get compliments on my skin.  Being able to purchase the 2nd stage separately is a real advantage.  I always have the exfoliation, stage one. remaining after the activating gel disappears
B004BD0YNK|5|Lovely shade of red! It compliments my skin and really brings out my green eyes!
B009ZLWRCY|5|I am a caregiver, and recently taught an elderly wife how to put TED hose stockings on her husband's feet. It was not possible for her to put them on without this aid. It is easy to use. I will recommend it again.
B00013MT6O|5|Cannot say enough about how much I love this.  I have made my own signature scent using this along with other oils and have had many people ask me to share.  I politely tell them no.☺
B00LTU3VYW|5|The best sunscreen/moisturizer combination!
B004DMEXQS|4|I got a sample package of these razors in a subscription box so I tried one out, even though I'm partial to the Gillette Venus line of women's razors. This review will contain some comparative information so you can decide if these are right for you, or whether you'd rather try a different razor (since different people look for different things in a razor).<br /><br />I do like this razor. Pros of the Soleil Bella:<br /><br />*Gives a close shave<br />*Doesn't irritate<br />*Glides smoothly over the legs and is fine on the underarms, as well<br />*The moisture strip doesn't stick to the tub if you set it down (this is probably my biggest complaint about the Venus razors)<br />*One piece, so you don't have to worry about matching handles with disposable blade cartridges (just toss the whole thing)<br /><br />Cons of the Soleil Bella:<br /><br />*The moisture strip isn't as effective as the ones on the Venus razors<br />*Not as easy to maneuver as other razors around the knees and ankles<br /><br />So, this razor has a lot to recommend it, and it may be a good solution for you, particularly if you don't like the moisture strip on the Venus razors.
B002VYT8Q0|5|I love this shampoo! I gave been using it since I was about 38 and now I'm 55 and still have my hair.... My brother(18 months older), doesn't use it and he's bald!
B00HX27AM4|3|Yes, it scatters the amount of hair, but don´t think that this is gonna be your short-mid term solution for hair removal...maybe if you use it constantly and for a looot of years,  you will be able to say that it worked, but if you are thinking about not having to take care of unwanted hair anymore, sorry but ain´t gonna happen.<br />I´m giving 3 starts because it  really diminishes the overall amount of hair, so if you have a ton of hair and you are just happy with having less, this could work for you. But keep in mind that you will have to keep shaving and waxing almost as much as before.
B00VZPGB1Q|5|Packaged in a 1 ounce dark brown glass bottle with a dropper included for ease of use. Serum is a clear darker yellow in color and has no smell. It is fairly runny and will run off your finger. I used 1 drop on a finger for each eye and it was plenty, I tapped it and massaged a few seconds and it absorbed well within a minute or so and left no oily or sticky residue. Any left on my finger I smeared around my lips too, can't hurt anything, right? I have extremely sensitive eyes that will start watering at the drop of a hat and this has not caused any irritation at all.<br /><br />I have only used it 3 times, twice yesterday and once this morning. I do feel a slight firming feeling as it dries. Today it does look like I have much more moisture in eye and lip area, my lipstick hasn't ran in the fine lines like it normally does, (Yes, I know it is for eyes, but I multi use products). I have no bags at all under my eyes and usually I do have some in the mornings, although they are not bad. I am going to continue to use this and judging by the improvement I seen in just 3 uses and this ingredient list, this is going to be a keeper for me.<br /><br />The ingredients list right off the box and posting a pic of the list on box also. Purified Water, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate, Acrylates/ceteth-20, Itaconate Copolymer, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Propylene Glycol, Sodium Hydroxide, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Carbomer, Hesperidin Mathyl Chalcone, Soluble Collagen, Sodium Hyaluronate, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Rosa Canina Fruit Extract, HamamelisVirginiana (Witch Hazel) Bark/Leaf/Stem Tetrasodium EDTA, Propylparaben, Methlparaben, Adenosine, Human Oligopeptide-1.<br /><br />This product does contain Eyeliss,and Haloxyl, With the powerhouse of ingredients you are getting in this product it is a fantastic bargain for the price.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

B00QEYESEU|4|It came looking amazing! Love the colors and the price although it would have been better it it wasn't so hard and you have to push it hard against you lips. But I would just but clear chapstick and it makes it more easier to apply.
B001QXC8F0|1|I've used Degree deodorant (not anti-perspirant) for many years because it was one of the few remaining products that does not contain aluminum. I came here to buy a 6-pack just to stock up but reading these reviews I had a revelation. For YEARS while using this product I have suffered from an occasional underarm rash that I actually chocked up to chafing due to a LACK of the product on my body. Rash=chafing so I must need more degree applied! Obviously I misread the symptoms and see that I too have suffered a rash caused by this product and have so for years. I found that Arm&Hammer has a new Essentials product that is also aluminum free (as well as silver free) that not only smells better but lasts longer and causes no rash. My eyes have been opened and I have made the switch. :-)
B002KANW6M|5|Smells a little funky, but this stuff works very well. I have sensitive, aging skin and it has been effective as well as non-irritating. No miracles, but better hydration and feel.
B00009RB1C|5|If you don't, you know what'll happen:<br /><br />There you are, shaving for that special evening out when you realize your face isn't getting any smoother.  No matter how many passes you make with your Norelco Reflex Plus shaver, you just can't seem to get that clean, close shave you remember from when it was new (when was that?  June, 2003? 2002!?).<br /><br />It's too late now.  No time to throw on a T-shirt, tear out of the garage to the nearest T**get, W*l-M**t or R*te-A*d and hope and pray they have a pack of Norelco HQ55+ heads in stock.<br /><br />Look, Amazon.com is going to pay for Super Saver shipping anyway, so there goes one excuse.  Norelco knows some guys keep a backup set of heads in the bathroom, so they seal the package against humidity.  Even if your shaver is brand new, why not order the new heads right now?  When they arrive, jot the replacement date on the back of the package with an indelible marker and toss it into the bathroom drawer, next to the replacement heads for your electric toothbrush.<br /><br />It's OK, you can thank me later.<br /><br />You're welcome.
B0026NWQPQ|1|Worst polish ever!!!  This stuff is too thick and never dries evenly.  Tried everything, and I just cant get it to work.  Defiantly will not be buying or recommending this brand for anyone.
B00023DIBI|5|I use Cucina all the time. I started from a gift I received and continued to purchase it.
B00135HZC2|4|I bought this from my tanning salon and of course found it on Amazon for a lot less expensive!  I used it once and noticed a huge difference.  The tingle is pretty intense and I felt like I was on fire after I got out of the bed.  It went away after an hour and I started to see a bronze, dark tan.  My friend made a comment that I looked brown instead of orange!  It doesn't have a bronzer so it is clean and easy to apply.  I wouldn't recommend to anyone who hasn't used a tingle lotion before but it is pretty hot.  It isn't as crazy hot as others I have used before so it is probably my favorite tingle lotion out there.
B00C8VLNDM|5|Living in NJ is no joke, the cold, the heat, the wind, the mess, my hair in the winter has so much static that I look like I am being plugged in a socket every single day. Folks, let me tell you this, this thing is the best thing ever. Throw away your expensive conditioners. This conditioner last for ever, all you do is shampoo with your regular shampoo then depending on where you live &#34;god bless the folks in the south for having great hair all year long&#34; in any case, roll the thingie in your hands like if you are going to soap yourself but instead run your hands in your hair, in the winter leave it on for a couple of minutes and summer just rise right away.<br /><br />The conditioner will start to work instantly...then get ready, dry your hair, hair dryer or al natural, &#34;Ha&#34; not in NJ&#34; which ever method you use, your hair will feel soft, shiny, huge body and soooo ver soft and healthy. I love this thing.<br /><br />I personally leave the conditioner in the container that came in  and put it in a dry place, I am not sure what the set up is for everyone, but I find this works the best in my bathroom.<br /><br />Love it, thank you very much. Don't ever stop making this thing, I will come over and spank you people..:-)

B0086VI9UI|4|My wife and I have been using this product for a few years and we are happy with it. The reason I do not give five star rating is that the brush wears out too fast for my liking.

B005KE017I|4|I didn't use this product. It's a gift for my sister. The first one they sent had been cracked on the cap. I contacted IQ Natural and they shipped another one quickly and in tact after apologizing for the first one.
B00BNZNG66|5|Love it, my whole family member still use it everyday. I add 50% of organic 100% cold prssed jojoba oil. It is fantastic and helped me going through this unusual winter.
B00EHWYPQW|1|So glad I got a sample of this perfume prior to spending money on a full bottle. I think it smells horrible. In all fairness, a lot of perfumes don't work with my body chemistry, so I had my best friend try it on her skin. It smelled the same on her...like the building supplies department in a home improvement center. Honestly...it smells like cut lumber. As far as the company I purchased the sample from, they provided excellent service. I received my sample several days ahead of its scheduled delivery and it was nicely packaged in a bubble-wrap padded envelope.
B004V3ZVOM|5|Great coverage in 1 coat!  (I still did 2). Long lasting without chips.  True black. Bonus matching RNP.
B003AYEFU4|2|I received this as a complimentary sample from influenster. I am very familiar with aussie products. I grew up with my mom using them and smelling the 'grape' scent. I loved it. However, when I used the sprunching spray it was so sticky and made my hair feel sticky. It didn't have a very pleasing spell.
