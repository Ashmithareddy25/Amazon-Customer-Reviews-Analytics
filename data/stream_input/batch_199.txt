B000002N3J|5.0|Madonna's creativity never stops.  This is just a collection of ballads, but still includes tracks like I Want You (with Massive Attack), One More Chance (produced with David Foster) and my favourite tracks like You Will See, This Used to be My Playground and Something to Remember.  These tracks are not just hit songs, but artistically very good ones.  I don't find other female artists could reach the standard of Madonna.  The album (not an album with brand new materials) has sold 3 million copies in alone in the U.S.!  Very good!
B00004RF9B|5.0|Forbidden Planet is a truly great sci-fi film which, despite the limitations of special effects technology in its time, remains fresh and convincing to this day.  The story is perhaps the greatest in the history of sci-fi cinema, with a very intriguing twist ending.  Brace yourself for that monster from the id!
B00005QGAT|5.0|Off The Wall is the highest achievement in Michael's artistry.  A very brilliant album with a very good remastered sound!  HIStory begins with Off the Wall!
B00000FZQ8|5.0|Like death and dying, there are several stages in evaluating &quot;Silent Running&quot; as a film.  The first stage is whoa! great effects, unusual idea for a film made in the early 1970s.  The second stage is the realization that you are being hit with some of the hardest propaganda since &quot;Battleship Potempkin&quot; or &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;.  The final stage is nostalgia for such a ground-breaking movie with super special effects.<br />Bruce Dern is comfy in his role as a slowly-unraveling sociopath.  What many don't realize is that the screenplay was written by a then-young Michael Cimino and Steven Bochco (&quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;.  What's truly amazing is the use of mechanical (not visual) effects.  If you've never been on an aircraft carrier, you'll believe that there is an American Airlines cargo freighter &quot;Valley Forge&quot;.  The details are wonderful: the corporate logos on the cargo pods, the technical manuals lying around, the overall believability of the wonderful drones, the background radio chatter from the other ships.<br />It's a shame Douglas Trumbull hasn't been more visible, this was a great effort.
B00005QGAX|5.0|Bad is a highly successful follow-up album to Thriller.  Rock and funcky, tracks like Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, Man In the Mirror, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Dirty Diana and Smooth Criminal are energetic songs.  Other strong tracks are also written or co-written by a young artist who launched his first world tour in 1987.  The sound is still fresh in the 21st century!  The bass guitar on Speed Demon and Just Good Friends and the sound of Another Part of Me are highly improved in this remastered edition.  What a classic album!  Bonus tracks Streetwalker and Fly Away added here are also very good!
B00003CXXS|2.0|\\"Jurassic Park III\\" proves definitively that the bloom is off the rose when it comes to this particular movie series.  In the third installment of the dinosaur epic, virtually every plot element - nay, every shot - seems like a tired rehash of the ones found in the two previous works.  The only difference here is that the dinosaurs manage to serve as unwitting family therapists for a tiresome divorced couple and their precocious young son.<br />Sam Neill, the star of the original film, returns in the role of nerdy paleontologist, Dr. Alan Grant - and his presence merely reminds us of the power that was generated by this material before it lost its originality and luster.  With nowhere left to go with the concept, this third version is reduced to little more than a monotonous series of chases through thick jungle growth, with the actors running around like mad in the foreground while some impressive looking dinosaurs wreak havoc in the background.  It seems inconceivable to imagine that it actually took THREE paid writers to come up with a script as lacking in originality and interest as the one we have here.  The anticlimactic ending is particularly ludicrous and incredible (not to mention faintly distasteful since the final shot turns out to be a close up looking straight into a pterodactyl's rear end).  Unlike the previous two films,  \\"Jurassic Park III\\" fails to generate even a modicum of chills and thrills.  There is, literally, not a single scary or suspenseful moment in the entire film.  Where is Steven Spielberg when you need him?  (Joe Johnston took over the directorial chores for this outing).  At least Spielberg knows how to get the adrenalin pumping - even with hokey material such as this.<br />The real problem with this film lies in the nature of the series itself.  Unlike the \\"Star Wars\\" films, which provide us with an ever-evolving story line and set of characters that help to make each new installment an integral part of a varied whole, the \\"Jurassic Park\\" franchise is pretty much limited to finding new excuses to get people in front of those rampaging dinosaurs.  The writers of this latest version, desperate to bring even a trace of originality to the concept, play with the childish notion that the veloceraptors are actually able to communicate with each other.  In other words, we have left the world of \\"reality,\\" where dinosaurs are allowed to be dinosaurs, and have turned these magnificent creatures into reptilian versions of ourselves.  What could be more arrogant?<br />With this third edition, the \\"Jurassic Park\\" series has hit its proverbial brick wall.ic Park\\" franchise is pretty much limited to finding new excuses to get people in front of those rampaging dinosaurs.

B00005QGAV|5.0|Michael changed his style drastically after Bad and created a very successful album.  Dangerous is my favourite MJ album.  With Thriller and Dangerous Michael proves he is the most talented artist in the history of pop music!  A very good album!
B00003CXXJ|1.0|(warning: no spellcheck used.)<br />This movie would have been OK except for the donkey.<br />He was the only character with a modern day &quot;lowerclass black american&quot; accent.<br />He incidentally was lazy, stupid and greedy as well.  I'm not a psychologist, but this made me feel really bad.  I went with a friend, and he felt uncomfortable, too.<br />It's become acceptable to associate negative traits with certain dialects.  For instance an &quot;appalachian&quot; or deep southern accent with ignorance and baseness.<br />My review is not going to change anything; but I hope that people with children teach their little ones to judge people based on their actions, character and intellect--instead of making assumptions based on the way they speak.<br />Thanks,<br />Joanne
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Thriller is the most important album in the history of pop music originally released in 1982.  With Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad and Dangerous, Michael is the most important artist in contemporary music.  &quot;Someone In the Dark&quot; is a very touching ballad by Michael.  I listen to it again and again!
B00004Z459|5.0|I know people think Linkin Park is some Limp Bizkit wannabe, but Limp Bizkit can't even measure up to Linkin Park. Hybrid Theory is a nice mix of hard rock and rap, without going too far with the rap, keeping it a rock album, unlike Limp Bizkit. Their lyrics are well written, so that you can understand what the writer is expressing and completely devoid of any swears! In case you're wondering, they do not have any corny lyrics, like some punk bands out there. The melody of their songs are very &quot;hummable&quot; and stay in your mind, so after you listen to the CD, songs like &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; still stay in your mind, in a positive way. The singers, Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda really help move the lyrics along, with Chester's strong voice and Mike's excellent rapping. All of their songs are perfect, including &quot;A Cure for the Itch&quot; done by their DJ, Joseph Hahn. This CD is well worth ten or more bucks.
B00004RYZT|5.0|I am 19, am in college and love to listen to 'good' music.  Easily said I know, but how do you define good music?  What draws the line between worth while, and a waste of time?  That's easy.  If you listen to a band more than once, it's good.  If you listen to them more than ten times, twenty, thirty, etc...it is just that much better.<br />     With Rammstein, you get just that.  It's funny, how can a band be so popular in the United States, when more than half of the people that like it don't understand what their saying.  It's funny that this is so, but that's the world for you.  Rammstein is not one of my favorite bands, but every time I listen to them, I get a feeling of adrenaline.  I do understand some German, and I get what they are trying to say, but that's not why I listen to them.  I listen to them becasue I like them.  Just that simple.  <br />     This DVD makes me want to see them in Concert Live!  I bought this from Amazon.com for a friend as a Christmas gift.  He let me watch it with him, and now I wish I had bought it for myself.  I might just do that. <br />     It's hard to say anything else on this, but i suggest that you buy this, or buy this for someone who enjoys Rammstein.  If you buy this as a gift, you will be one of their favorite friends or relatives for a while to come.
B00003CXCS|5.0|I highly recommend this film.  It is wonderful!
6305177473|5.0|I just love this movie. It is very sweet, and Lindsay Lohan is just charming. The story is about two young girls who meet at a girls camp, and suddenly realises they are twins. And with that the fun begins, they come up with a plan to get their parents back together: The parent trap. But first the girls have to work team up to overcome the obstacles in their way, like their fathers new girlfriend. This is a warm and cute movie i would recommend for everyone to see. It's perfect for a family home evening, anyone can enjoy this movie.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I thought that this is one of the best DVD's i have bought i think it is great i love it.The audio commentry just is great with all the Goonie's back together again we find out things we have never new about the Goonie's.The deleted scenes are a treat and i enjoyed viewing them what im really trying to say is if your a true fan of the 80's and the Goonie's then you have to purchase this for the nostalgia and to relived such a great movie.<BR>       SWEET !!!!!
B00005LB50|4.0|It's quite remarkable how the Buffalo Springfield were able to pump out so many great tracks in less than three years. Most of it was quality songwriting from musicians who took in all of the growing changes around them and presented the times with a fresh perspective and opposed the &quot;assembly line&quot; approach of pop that was beginning to die out. But like all good things with such intense profile &amp; passion, comes recklessness and eventual implosion, only to be left with a break-up that's still desputed and, in spite of the great output, little to show for it financially (at that time).<br />We can add the cliche that the Buffalo Springfield were rich in a recorded legacy beyond their three official albums and this box set is only partial to this sentiment. What you will hear is a band taking shape with some of their earliest demos, then  taking flight as a band developing their talents in the studio, at first unified, then fragmented. I'm happy to say a good percentage of this is magnificent.<br />CD1 concentrates on early solo demos (at this point, only Richie Furay, Stephen Stills &amp; Neil Young) and the first Gold Star/Columbia Studio session which would make up their debut. The solo stuff is pretty much hit and miss, with some great moments (&quot;Sad Memory&quot;, &quot;Clancy&quot;, &quot;Flying On The Ground&quot;, etc.) with some pretty forgettable fodder (&quot;I'm Your Kind Of Guy&quot;, &quot;Hello, I've Returned&quot;). The rest are the tracks that we come to know and love in beautiful MONO (and there's not one ounce of the horrid stereo mix).<br />CD2 gets real interesting with the band evolving from a great garage folk-punk band into some seriously crafted pop and rock. With great moments like very raw acetate versions of &quot;Mr. Soul&quot; &amp; &quot;Baby, Don't Scold Me&quot; with stompers like &quot;Kauhuna Sunset&quot; and &quot;Buffalo Stomp&quot; (sounding just like the Jesus &amp; Marychain here), you get some timeless stuff like &quot;Down Down Down&quot;, &quot;Pretty Girl Why&quot;, &quot;We'll See&quot;, &quot;Everydays&quot; and many of the fragments that would make up &quot;Stampede&quot;, &quot;Buffalo Springfield Again&quot; and numerous bootlegs. But the show stopper is Stills' beautiful solo demo of &quot;Hung Upside Down&quot;, which will seriously give you chills.<br />But when it gets to CD3, that's when all begins to fall apart. With the remainder of the &quot;Again&quot; tracks, it's all solo ambitions from there. Some great Young demos (&quot;Old Laughing Lady&quot;, &quot;Round And Round And Round&quot;), wonderful tracks like &quot;On The Way Home&quot; (alternate mix), &quot;Iam A Child&quot; and &quot;Kind Woman&quot; (to name a few). Unfortunately, it also paints a picture of Stills rather self-indulgent side with some great tracks (&quot;Uno Mundo&quot; and the excellent solo demo of &quot;Four Days Gone&quot;) with some duds (&quot;Special Care&quot; and &quot;Questions&quot;). An interesting early version of Furay's &quot;What A Day&quot; is featured, sung by Stills, who does great throughout two-thirds of it then messes up the ending. Yeah, even great talents flub sometimes.<br />CD4: Debut in MONO and &quot;Again&quot; in stereo. Nice addition.<br />The booklet is pretty much a newspaper cuttings and scotch tape deal, which has a nice punk rock feel about it (and you can almost smell the garage fumes along with the age), but is kind of redundant if you want straight-ahead reading material. the essays, recording information and show interinerary are also cool, but an overall sense of order you will not get.<br />The omissions?<br />&quot;Carefree Country Day&quot; is a Messina track and a big dud. Not missed here.<br />&quot;In the Hour Of Not Quite Rain&quot;. A BIG mistake in omitting this. One of the great Gothic Rock anthems and a major departure in sound. <br />&quot;Four Days Gone (jazz version)&quot;. In spite of Young's objections to Messina's handling, itwould have been nice to compare the demo and released versions. And both are equally good. <br />&quot;Buffalo Springfield Again&quot; LP MONO version. I had the pleasure to hear a rare copy of this years ago. Great mix. I know the MONO version of the debut is king, but this one is amazing.<br />&quot;Bluebird (long version)&quot;. People will differ with this one. Some think it's magnificent and hate the banjo part of the shorter mix. Others will think it's a half-baked studio jam that is only to be listened to once (I go with the latter.).<br />LIVE TRACKS. The liners go on about the awesome powers of the Springfield in person. Why didn't we get any examples? Could this be another box set. Damn, I hope so.<br />Yeah, I'm pretty critical with this gathering. It's obvious that all five surviving members do not see eye to eye on the selection. I know that's there's much more that Neil has to be hiding somewhere in his archives and, even under his meticulous supervision, it raises more questions &amp; speculations.<br />But in the end, is it all worth it? Oh, yes it is. It may not be the most polished and strictly sticks to the chronology, but the music speaks for itself. It's a shame that this wasn't a band that gave it more of a chance.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Don't listen to all the other people who are giving it bad reviews, as a HT hardcore person, extreme movie goer, I tell<BR>you that you will be blown away by this movie.
B000008B01|5.0|This was recorded in 1973.  It's one of the few records that changed my life, twisted my head around.  Joo doesn't sound, at first, as if he's doing anything.  There seems to be no modulation, no color.  Then you begin to hear the beauty behind the repetition, the soul, and the cunning of a true artist.  There aren't too many people who could be so completely traditional and so completely weird at the same time.  Gilberto is a fantastic guitar player, and he swings.  A lot of people regard this as the greatest Brazilian music recording ever made; at the very least, it's one of the two or three definitive bossa nova records.
B000059MEK|5.0|After seeing the videos of One More Time, Aerodynamic, and Digital Love in Europe on vacation I had immediately fallen in love.<br />One More Time is the classic party song. The guitar solo is amazing in Aerodynamic. Digital Love's lyrics are good to listen to, they get your imagination going (picture yourself dreaming about dancing with your crush... see?!). Harder Better Faster Stronger is my favorite song on the CD, the lyrics are set up perfectly, and the beat steps in at the perfect time, notice how when the vocoder is setup to the guitar, the sound it generates! Crescendolls is considered a favorite by many, a bit repetitive, but yes I agree the beat is one of the best. I love Superhero's BG sounds, as well as the &quot;Love in the air...&quot;. High Life revives disco, and it brings it back to near perfection. Something About Us has a nice slow beat, sets the mood, and the lyrics say &quot;I love you&quot; in the beautiful manner. I love Voyager's bass guitar, it steps the CD back up into a faster beat. The insturments in Verdis Quo remind me of something out of the middle ages, but it's a perfect fit for the song. I can understand why people hate Short Circuit, but it grew on me, so I enjoy it. Face to Face has some great lyrics and the instruments are set in at just the right time between the chorus. Too Long may look too long, but it goes by like nothing when you listen to it, Romanthony does a great job with the lyrics and the beat fits in well.
B00005JHAB|5.0|Jennifer Lopez is absolutely stunning and beautiful in the romantic comedy, &quot;The Wedding Planner.&quot; In this hillarious and witty comedy, Lopez plays the role of a workaholic wedding planner who is an expert at bringing other couples together through the bonds of harmonious matrimony, but a &quot;hopeless&quot; romantic with no one to love in her own personal spare time. Both Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey give stellar performances in this thoughtfully planned out, humorous and insightful love story.  &quot;A modern day Romeo and Juliet.&quot; The Long Beach Arts, Entertainment and Literary Review respectfully gives &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; two thumbs up. This film is definitely a must see! <br />*The Long Beach Arts, Entertainment &amp; Literary Review
B00005N9CV|2.0|As an owner of a few Diana Krall's CD, I have to say this CD is truly a waste of her talent.  In this, she made it too obvious that she fell into the trap of commercialism and easy money.  Where is jazz, passion, emotion, and depth???  No life in this album.  This is one of those tacky labels with a famous name attached.  Good for a cocktail/lounge music, at most.
B000002A73|5.0|Roger Waters in his best performance ever.<BR>What a nice surprise to listen a few tracks of this album in his last live performance, he is really great and he touches the people with his lyrics I keep hoping Pink Floyd can get together again.

0694003611|5.0|This book is the best childrens book I have ever read! As a kid i absolutly loved it! I loved the way the pictures were so cheerful and bright, but yet some are very calm and make you very relaxed. I would reccomend this book to any mother with young children anywhere from ages 3 through 10, even not in my teen years I still find this book very interesting and when I am a mother I will definitly read this to my child.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn's voice is smooth, and strong, a singer with a sense of self, and not afraid to express it!A fresh take, on living and loving,and trying to find life's truths.One of my favorite singers, looking forward to hearing more from her,definately worth the time chillin', and listening!
B00005JY1B|5.0|I loved this movie. it had a some good turns and some tearful times aswell. My now fiance' watched this movie with me. He liked it aswell. So this also tells you that men will like it also. to end this review. I got engaged after this movie ended. that was also the best part of it.
B00003CXS4|1.0|This movie is trash.  I feel guilty even spending any time thinking about it, so low on the hierarchy of artistic achievement does it sit.  But it manages to be bad in several very interesting, novel ways.  It's a new form of terrible.  The movie is beautifully shot, for example.  It has learned how to be flashy and shallow from a generation of music videos and special effects.  Wow.  Bravo.  The plot, too, is reasonably interesting.  There are certainly too many undifferentiated characters, but overall, the story could have been adapted into a good noir type movie.  But instead, Guy again tries to appeal to the surface generation, and succeeds in making a movie about as deep as a kiddie's waiting pool, and with as much intellectual value as a Burger King placemat.
B00000DHZJ|2.0|Clearly, CREAM ,at their flying best, cruise all over Jimi's experience. A lot of Jimi's super-rockers don't sound much better than fuzz-toned noise. Can anyone, beyond rock fans who may not have explored much else, seriously suggest that &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, &quot;Crosstown Traffic&quot;,&quot;Manic Depression&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;  and most of the others, can be listened to on a regular basis? They're too loud, and tuneless,and they even seemed so to this grizzled Boomer when he first heard them ages ago. Still, Jimi was close to a wizard with his unique guitar work,melody,and lyrics on three slow ones: &quot;Wind Cries Mary&quot;, &quot;Little Wing&quot;, and &quot;Castles Made of Sand&quot;,three songs which even CREAM could not improve on if they tried.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|As it has been stated before, this movie is not for everyone.  For example, how do you describe this great movie to a friend?  &quot;It's a musical about can-can dancing prostitutes!&quot;  One major problem that normal people have with this film is that the editing appears to incluce ten or twelve different camera angles for every spoken sylable.  However, this must've appealed to my attention defficeit, because I wasn't able to tear myself away from the thing.  Between the good voices in the singing scenes are several good acid trips of screaming emotion that counter act the over-the-top horror of emotions we're hit with in, for example, Requiem for a Dream.  But that's another story.  Not since Yellow Submarine have I ever wanted this much to take mind-altering chemicals for the purpose of a movie.  And I'm a conservative Christian who would never actually do such a thing.  It's just THAT GOOD.  So if you or someone you know is really excited about being ADHD or you want to know what it's like, watch it.
B000002UAX|4.0|For 30 years, WHITE ALBUM has seemed like a thrown together assortment,some top of the line, mixed in with probably this band's rock bottom. We have, once again, Paul leading the fight with some more timeless ballads, &quot;I Will&quot;, &quot;Mother's Son&quot;, and some old vaudevillian numbers like &quot;Martha My Dear&quot;, and &quot;Honey Pie&quot;...But we have &quot;Wild Honey Pie&quot;,&quot;Me and My Monkey&quot;, &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; (which achieved notoriety with the Manson gang),&quot;Why Don't We Do it on the Road?&quot; (Paul at his worst),and &quot;Yer Blues&quot;.&quot;Back in the USSR&quot; still is some fun (a BeachBoys takeoff), but &quot;Birthday&quot; is again not of Paul's best.Even George's famous &quot;Guitar Weeps&quot; is done too loudly. There is a mellow version that sounds a lot better. &quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; for the past  21 years seems even precognitive,sadly,with John singing the title words.&quot;Blackbird&quot;, and &quot;Rocky&quot; may still inspire young guitarists, for good reason. And &quot;Long,long,long&quot;,&quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot;, and &quot;Good Night&quot; are as good as ever...If only the group eliminated the junk, and added a handful of even medicore material, the album would stand up much better!! Oh, and &quot;Julia&quot; is John at his introspective best,singing about his long gone mother.
0684847248|5.0|Mr. Scott Pick's work is truly commendable, not only because he has tried to present an original view but also because of the effort that was involved in actually writing the book. On reading the book, it becomes clear that Mr. Scott has himself overcome tremondous barriers himself and that the path he has guided us to is what he himself believes in.<br />He has divided the book into 4 sections.<BR>Discipline<BR>Love<BR>Religion<BR>Faith<br />1) Discipline - In this section, Mr. Scott Pick has accurately pointed out the various causes that keep us away from discipline. These include delaying gratification, acceptance of responsibility, dedication to truth and balancing. No amount of words would substitute reading this section of the book.<br />2) Love - Mr. Scott Pick provides the best description of love that I have ever come across. Love, according to him, is extending oneself for another's spiritual growth. This means that we may give others what they need rather than what they want. It also means that we constantly think about how we can extend ourselves for the benefit of those whom we love. <br />3) Religion - Here Mr. Scott says that everyone has a religion whether or not they are aware of it. He seems to suggest that religion should not be taken in its most extreme forms.<br />4) Grace - By far, the best section that I found in the book this section describes our interaction with God, of the ways that God has helped us that we could never had been consciously possible. This section insists us to keep our minds open and be consistly looking out for Grace for when God may shower it upon us, we should be ready to receive. <BR>Also he tells us that we all have to try to become God. In trying to be God, we are overwhelmed by the demands that are laid upon us when we try to be God because we constantly have to keep thinking and utilize our powers so that we may be able to extend ourselves for the benefit of others. Also at this point, we may feel quite alone for there will be very few poeple at that point. But that should not detract us from growing spiritually.<br />This book is definitely a book to be read if one really wants to grow spiritually. The concepts in the books are simple though they are novel and unique, also the explanation provided with examples serves as a big plus in understanding the concepts. The concepts of life seems to flow as Mr. Scott Pick explains. The sentence &quot;Life is difficult&quot; seems appropriate as the first sentence as Mr. Scott rightly and truly challenges some of the wrong concepts that we have believed in.<BR>A MUST READ.
B000002GFC|5.0|Yes, I still have the four original Cream LP's from the late 60's. For pure energetic fun,it seems hard to top these three avant-garde rockers with a brisk touch of jazz. &quot;I Feel Free&quot; and &quot;I'm So Glad&quot; are perfect for full blast driving with the windows down, whether you're 16 or pushing 50, both every bit as frolicksome as the titles suggest. And some great singing to boot! &quot;White Room&quot; may be a retread of  &quot;Brave Ulysses&quot; , but that's fine, since they both have that whirlwind sound that this super-high energy group practically  owned!Notice too that they never scream,they always sing!!! The jamming in &quot;Crossroads&quot;,even if it is just another blues,has surely never been matched for tuneful ferocity,with the bass and lead guitars seeming to be in a heavyweight championship match. &quot;Badge&quot; is another old favorite, even if it may have lost it's luster.The others are worth a listen too. It's too bad &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot;,from the old DISRAELI GEARS is not aboard..Top of the line hard-hitting,breezy,winning,matchless,harmonius pop/rock which blisters just about all the conpetition,which is generally forgettable anyway.

The concepts in the books are simple though they are novel <br />and unique, also the explanation provided with examples serves as a big <br />plus in understanding the concepts. The concepts of life seems to flow <br />as Mr. Scott Pick explains. The sentence &quot;Life is difficult&quot; seems <br />appropriate as the first sentence as Mr. Scott rightly and truly <br />challenges some of the wrong concepts that we have believed in.<BR>A MUST READ.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is the best Cd I've bought other than Staind's &quot;Break the Cycle&quot;.  I love every song on their debut album.  I am so glad that this album is doing so great on the billboard charts.  They make good music.  It's unlike anything I've ever heard before.  Every song on their album is great and none of them sound the same unlike other artists every song that they make is different from the others.
B00004RF9B|5.0|There are three sci-fi film essentials: Fritz Lang's \\"Metropolis,\\"  \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\\" and \\"Forbidden Planet.\\"  There three films defined science fiction, as we know it today.  \\"Forbidden Planet,\\" for example, is the father of the Star Trek franchise, and the sets provided the basis for \\"Lost in Space.\\"  And look at all of Robby the Robots grandchildren!<br />This film is a science fiction rewrite of  \\"The Tempest,\\" which helps explain its sticking power.  It has the rescue vessel, the mad scientist, and the alien mysteries, all of which capture your interest and never let you go. IT has elements of a murder mystery, with hilarious subplots about a naïve young girl and hungry boys lucked up in psace for a year.  IS it 1950's cheese?  Yes, but it is fun to watch.<br />The killer is an invisible villain.  Aside from being cheaper, this builds the suspense to an incredible level.  Come on-you see \\"Alien\\" and you see a lanky guy in a rubber suit. But an invisible villain lets your imagination run wild, which can be wilder than anything Hollywood can ever make.<br />The situation of a scientific-research vessel that discovers now life and new civilization provides the pattern for Star Trek:  the main characters being the Captain, the ship's doctor and the engineer interacting.  Leslie Neilson has the same soul as William Shatner.  For good or bad, there is no Star Trek equivalent of Robby the Robot, unless you count Mr. Spock.  But I digress.<br />Another observation is Altair's insidious wardrobe changing, which preempts Queen Amildala by five decades.  Walter Pidgeon gives a masterful performance, and steals the show.  So many mad scientists are flat and soulless-they are even passionless went it comes to their passions in science.  But Pidgeon breathes life in what could have been a cheesy 1950's science fiction throwaway.<br />The costuming and sets are superb.  True this is 1950, so some of the sets look like they were done with Crayolas, but can any \\"cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?\\"  The doorways in the film give you the weird impression of alien civilization. The lab and Krell building blow your mind with all of the gizmos. Nothing specific, but the overall atmosphere suggests things alien.  I wonder if they actually had an image of the Krell, or if they just made it up as they went along the image you see haloed in laser-fire may be a Krell, or may be the Krell equivalent of a Frankenstein's monster.  The plaster cast of the monster's foot suggests that the monster is an imaginary composite, but we will never know. By the way, the idea that a civilization would not have pictures is not weird ay all-Islamic art does not allow for graven images to be made, so they focus on Arabic calligraphy.  .<br />The soundtrack is theremin based-the eerie \\"oooh\\"-making machine from the Beach Boy's song \\"Good Vibrations.\\"  It adds to the weirdness of the movie, and is comparable to the soundtrack in the 1981 remake of  \\"Flash Gordon.\\"  Most experimental soundtracks flop, but this comes off perfectly, since it is suggested that the music we a re listening to is actually Krell music.<br />The DVD is an annoying two-sided disc with letterbox and \\"pan and scan\\" on each side.  People-Wide screen, wide screen, wide screen!<br />Two parting thoughts:<br />First, at the heart of this movie is a psycho-thriller that brings your mind to the edge as you are forced to look at yourself.  We have the technology and the power to be gods, but can we stand it if in our hearts, we are devils?  Look at this war we are fighting.<br />Second, if this film seems familiar, it is because everyone has ripped it off.  You do not counterfeit a worthless coin.\\"cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?\\"  The doorways in the film give you the weird impression of alien civilization.

0784010501|4.0|This movie/documentary is a combination of 1) black and white backstage footage of Madonna and her crew and 2) colorful concert footage. If you are a Madonna fan, this movie is worth having just for the great concert footage, especially because the Blonde Ambition tour footage has not been widely released. I also appreciated the backstage footage. I was surprised at how candid Madonna was at times regarding problems with her show- whether it was content or technical problems. I found it interesting that Madonna's main concern was &quot;Did you like my show?&quot; She is always the consummate entertainer. This movie is an interesting look at a multi-faceted and colorful performer- on and off stage.
B00003CXUM|5.0|This movie is so great! There is an odd tension that builds. Quiet, beautiful and mesmerizing. The score is perfect! The color even looks like a late 50s early 60s movie. It's sort of old technicolor. Maggie Cheung is gorgeous. The chemistry of the film invloves you so deeply, you don't notice the time spent watching it. I don't have the Criterion DVD yet (it's not out), but believe me I will.
0446608955|5.0|I have never read any books by Nicholas Sparks before this one but after finishing &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; I will.  It's a classic, touching love story that I couldn't put down once I started.  I recommend it for absolutly anyone! I am in high school so I related well to some of the things Jamie and Landen were going through, but I must say, you can be 17, or 71 to enjoy this book, it's so heartfelt and it really makes you think about your own life.  Wonderful book.  I also thought the ending was done quite well...
0345442989|5.0|This is an excellent book, and one of the better Star Wars books released in recent times. The book provides a great deal of the backstory behind episode I, and in my opinion, should have been released a couple of months after the movie. <BR>The writing is solid, the dialouge worked in really well with the known characters. The characterisations were fairly good, but I found Captain Cohl to be a little bit two dimensional, he followed a pretty straight bad guy who eventually turns good path.<BR>The book is mostly politics, I enjoy that sort of thing, and some of the Senate characters hardly seen in episode I have big parts here, Valorum in particular. Palpatine was also done very well, the more I read, the more he conformed to the character I had imagined him to be. I think most of all, I liked the details given about the pre-Empire galaxy in general.<BR>James Luceno has done well here, better than those awful New Jedi Order 'books', it's painfully obvious in this novel that he has used the NJO map, but I guess no book can be perfect.<BR>Overall, an excellent book, if you found episode I unsatisfying or you're simply a Star Wars fan, buy this book.
B00005JKT8|4.0|This movie borrows very heavily on other movies:  an incredulous Duke Leopold (Hugh Jackman) wandering the streets of New York, like H. G. Wells in 'Time After Time'; or Kate (Meg Ryan) jumping out of a cab and running to meet the man of her dreams, like 'Sleepless in Seattle'; or lovers separated by time like 'Somewhere in Time', etc.  But, despite the thin plot piecing together borrowed scenes, the movie works because of the chemistry between these two superstars (yes, after this movie, Hugh is a superstar) and the fully-realized supporting characters. When I went to a sneak preview and was surrounded by single women, their collective sighs over Leopold's elegant gallantry almost drowned out the sound track.  Not like me and bonny Kate...sigh.  Also, Meg's proclivity for subtle comedy has never been so much in evidence or put to such good use.  For me, the ending came to soon, and sadly without the need of a hanky...for that I blame the director (bad, bad director...no biscuit for you).  So, through no fault of hers, this isn't quite in the same stratosphere as 'Sleepless in Seattle' or 'You Have Mail', but it's close.  Meg is back!

0385505833|2.0|If this were written by one of my ninth grade English students rather than John Grisham, and turned into me for grading, I might write &quot;trite&quot;, &quot;predictable&quot;, or maybe even &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;stereotypical&quot; in the margin.  The end is thoroughly stereotypical for a Christmas book, and of course, the cockles of our heart are supposed to be warmed. (Dickens did it first, and far better.) Long before the end, I was turned off.  The plot is rather unbelieveable-- after all, in our culture,  would anyone really care if a family decided not to celebrate Christmas?  This book has none of the usual characteristics of a Grisham novel. And it's very, very short. Not worth the price even with the discount. I've given it two stars only because it's quick and easy to read, so it's valuable to pass the time somewhere like the doctor's office where you can't concentrate on a real book. Would this have been published without Grisham's name on the front? I doubt it. I'm sure it would not be selling as well as it is.
0140067477|5.0|This is a well written, easily read book that provides and introduction and explanation of the general tenets of Tao through 5 main characters and the circumstances they are confronted with.  Metaphor and real-life analysis and observation of how we live and think, and how Taoism can be applied to our perspectives and daily lives, if we want it to.  Selection from the writings of Tao Te Ching, and other Taoist thinkers to the book's characters and stituations help explain the meanings for the neophyte.   <BR>    The significant influence of Puritanism on our past and present U.S. history is also delved into.  The Puritan influence has always been with us and I am convinced it always will be.  <BR>    The American work week gets longer every year, according to studies, and we have less and less time for the good things in life:  family, friends, introspection, personal growth, and even pursuing hobbies.  We are constantly running from one place to another, both literally and figuratively, in search of--something.  Fulfillment,  happiness, or what have you.  We try to buy it, acquire it, reach out to it.  But it's right in front of our faces--we just have to allow ourselves to see it.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park, with its two-vocalist assault, siren-emulating DJ samples, and crunchy riffs, fits the categorization of &quot;Nu-Metal&quot; like a glove. However, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is a truly exceptional album, and arguably one of the most important of the past decade, because it is one that has established a new face of Nu-Metal that definitely has staying power.<br />1. Papercut: Not terribly catchy, not terribly special, although it does set the perfect tone for the CD.<br />2. One Step Closer: Hardest hitting track. As is the case with a few other tracks however, the emcee, Mike Shinoda, does not have nearly has large a role has his talent suggests he should.<br />3. With You: Uses a Dust Brothers' sample. Similar to tracks 6 and 7 in that the guitar and bass are very heavy, and there is a good deal of rapping.<br />4. Points of Authority: In my opinion, the best track the band has yet to create. Heavy chords, strategically placed DJ work, and catchy lyrics.  <br />5. Crawling: Slow, melodic, heavy.<br />6. Runaway: My least favorite track. Just not very special.<br />7. By Myself: Think Rage Against the Machine's power chords meet Scott Weiland.<br />8. In the End: Solid track that deals with the concept of essentially having nothing when you reach &quot;the end.&quot;<br />9. A Place For My Head: Really strong, vengefull, and hatefull track. <br />10. Forgotten: The rapid swiching from Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda really works well. Personally, I think this would have made a great single.<br />11. Soley devoted to the work of Linkin Park's Mr. Hahn. Nice electric vibe, but it just doesn't seem to flow well.<br />12. Pushing Me Away: Catchy, and similar to &quot;In the end&quot; in terms of its message and sound.

6305165912|5.0|Ostensibly &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is a farce, a hodgepodge of film noir, westerns and mistakened identity. And yet if one looks beyond the surface of expletives and grandiose set pieces -- which only repeated viewings of the film can yield -- one will find a film which delves deeper into issues of masculinity such as sports, virility, war and redemption; subjects which just about every critic overlooked when stating the obvious in their review of the film.<br />As the Stranger states during the beginning of the movie the Dude is &quot;a man for his time and his place;&quot; a product of the '60's who meanders through the early 90's, a time in which many men in the U.S. seemed to be vicariously reasserting their manliness through the Gulf War . The Gulf War informs many events in the movie from the Dude's belittlement at the hands of the Big Lebowski (&quot;This aggression will not stand .  .  .man!&quot;) to Walter Sobchak's thoughts about &quot;Charlie&quot; and the possible outcome of the then impending conflict in the Persian Gulf.<br />The film is a literal deconstruction of everything that is normally associated with masculinity. From the outset, the Dude , like so many real and fictional heros before him, tries to right a perceived wrong. He wants recompense for his solied rug. And yet he fails miserably at this task with only a bruised jaw, a dead friend and a spurious newborn  to show for it. <BR> <BR>In a sense the Dude's loss of virlity speaks about the rest of the Male characters in the film: the millionaire Korean War veteran who has lost his legs, the Vietnam veteran who has lost his mind, and the German nihilists who lose their hold of their philosophy when one states that the outcome of their ransom scheme  isn't fair. Even the more macho characters,  Jesus and the Malibu Police Chief, try to assert their masculinity and yet still appear emasculated in some way. The scene of Jesus and his bowling partner earnestly polishing off their bowling balls undercuts Jesus taunts of violating Walter and the Dude in a blatantly sexual manner during their upcoming bowling match. And although the Malibu Police Chief tows a hard line when it comes to protecting his beachfront community he cannot be taken seriously when showing a little leg with his knee length khaki shorts.     <br />Ironically, the only character who asserts their masclinity without diastrous results is Maude Lebowski, the female lead, played with deadpan comic delivery by Julianne Moore. She finds her stolen rug and in the process a suitable sperm donor in the form of the Dude. Unlike the Dude,  she sees what she wants and gets it. However as evidenced with the many props and works of art which decorate her loft, most notably, a bloodied, dismembered female mannequin and a large still life of scissors,  it is implied that Maude might have lost some of her femininity in her quest to assert herself.<br />Ultimately, &quot;the Big Lebowski&quot; deals with the question that the Real Jeff Lebowski poses to the Dude: &quot;What makes a man?&quot;  Is it a pair of testicles as the Dude so blithely states or is it something more such as a  24K ring for a 300 game, a notche on the bedpost for a romp in the hay or some repayment for a soiled rug. <br />The Coen Brothers don't provide any defintive answers. One can harken to the fact that the creators don't please the audience with a trite cathartic climax as the unseen and much ballyhoed match between Jesus and the Dude might have served. Instead they let the enigmatic Stranger have the last word about &quot;the Human Comedy&quot; which trails off before letting the audience in on what it all means.  As is, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; literally  gets the ball rolling in thinking about the question of what is means to be an American Male at the dawn of the 21st Century.
B00003CXXS|4.0|Jurassic Park 3 was overall not that bad. The film had a very similar plot to The Lost World: Jurassic Park only without the T-rex in San Diago.Alan Grant,the palintoligist from the original, sets off to another dino infested island with what he things area bunch of thrill seekers. Of course something goes wrong. The plan crashs and the survivores are stalked by a new dinosar called a Spinousorous. It turns out the people he's hosting are looking for there 13 year old soon who got stranded on the island months befor. And so the adverture begins. The story and the dinosaures are fine except for three things: 1. Where's the T-rex? You see one in the beging for a short time but thats it. The've replaced it with the spino thing. 2. There is not as much tension and fright in this one like there was in the previous two. Last, you can tell Steven Spilberg did not direct this. It's missing his special touch. But over all it's a great movie and DVD. A must for JP fans!
B00005QIPH|3.0|I don't care one way or the other about the &quot;hype&quot;. It's either the next great band or it's not. It's not. They are unquestionably a good band and some songs are better than others. The album is spotty at best with lots of weak moments. And comparisons to Television are in the minds of the band or its record company only. They may WISH to be compared but outside of their common geographical origin, they have zero in common. Well, that's not true...they both have vowels in their names. The next pretty good thing.
B00005Q66T|2.0|Why would any serious Madonna fan want this collection of so called greatest hits?  First off the cover is ugly, then you go to the bookelt and realise there aren't any chart listings, lyrics or anything else, but a jumbled assortment of 1cm sized Madonna pix (wait let me grab my magnifying glass to see that one in the upper left).  There isn't any new material to offer fans who have all her other recordings and worst of all the songs have been butchered.  A cleaned up version of Human Nature?  A shortened version of Deeper and Deeper?  What's with all the tampering?  This is the first Madonna cd I'll not be buying.<br />GHV2 is nowhere near as strong as Immaculate Collection (notice it even has a better name), Something to Remember or even You Can Dance, but will certainly appease the casual fans who enjoy her newer material and don't mind that songs have been altered from their original versions.  It's just upsetting that more of an effort wasn't made to appeal to her long-time fans.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Like most people, I'll agree, the the special effects were great.  Having to suffer through what was more like a 30 second melodramtic television commercial turned into an hour and a half - OUCH!  Nobody to blame but myself, who bought it?  I made it through the first disc, just to see the only good part.  Having done that, maybe I'll play the second - one day.  On some dreary Sunday when I need a nap.  I guess this is what happens when you try to please everybody.  I agree with the reviewers that say, watch Tora Tora Tora, for a movie about Pearl Harbour.

What a gret combo of dance and drama in the music.  I loved it!!

The rest are just random sound effects/noise and song \\"fragments\\", that's not ART, that's unfinished work!  Tool has now joined the ranks of those talented bands who have turned their backs on the roots of their success. If you don't believe me, listen to Ticks&Leeches again. They're yelling at the Record Execs and Producers! This CD is just a vehicle for their angst against the record company.  If Tool set out to make a junky, unfinished, unlistenable record... they've Succeeded!  I say DON'T BUY it, and maybe next time they'll have to return to making real music (or they won't get a contract). We certainly don't need more releases like this.

B00003Q43A|5.0|This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.<br /><br />The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.<br /><br />This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.<br /><br />Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was. It is, indeed, a moment to remember.<br /><br />The quality of this two disc DVD is superlative with crystal clear visuals and great sound quality. The letterbox format offers both the theatrical release version and the special edition version from which to choose. The special edition version offers an extra nine minutes of restored footage. The second disc offers a myriad of features, including an interesting thirty minute documentary on the making of the film.

630587493X|5.0|Based on the Isaac Asimov short story &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot; which was later adapted by Robert Silverberg in &quot;The Positronic Man,&quot; director Chris Columbus has managed to merge a powerful romantic epic with Asimov's intellectual story.<br />The story was written to celebrate the 1976 Bicentennial of the USA and Asimov's story told about a robot that strives to be human.  While this is a very prevalent idea nowadays, i.e. Data on Star Trek, it was pretty original at that time.<br />Columbus shows wonderful respect for the source material, which he betters in every way.  How often can you say that of a movie?  Columbus understands that in the future everything will not be immediately different.  The film portray this by slowly adding futuristic elements on top of real settings.  In an era of CGI sets that don't look real, this sci-fi movie is all the better for it's matter of fact approach to the future.<br />The performances are uniformly great with Williams giving such a strong performance beneath the costume that when his face is revealed it is a little startling.  He also injects a sense of humor that makes more powerful the romance and pathos of the plot.<br />This is a film that deserved better than it got.  It is an epic, in the sense of Tolstoy and &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, with a science fiction worldview.<br />In this film of a robot's search to become more human, we feel more strongly the precious gift of our own humanity.  That is all we can ask of any work of art.
B000009QOC|5.0|Wow,This album really rocks!!. I`ve only heard this one and their first self-titled debut and it`s really hard to say which one's best because they both rock, but I must say this one contains much more variation than their first.<BR>Here you have great heavy rock numbers (\\"Long Way Back From Hell\\", \\"Snakes Of Christ\\", \\"Tired Of Being Alive\\")a very good ballad (\\"Blood And Tears\\")a semi-ballad (\\"Devil's Plaything\\") <BR>and a blues-inspired acoustic (\\"I'm The One\\"). Fans of their first album may be surprised or dissapointed because of the variation but I think i'ts an album that grows after each time you listen to it. Ultimately, I think every rock n'roll fan should own this album, a worthy complement to anyones collection.
B00005RYKU|1.0|I agree with the reviewer who said it was the worst movie of the year because it was. The movie was predictable and suffered from poor acting all around...or maybe it was just poor direction. It wasn't suspenseful or thrilling. It was just bad.

The humor surfaces because of the crew of the Enterprise trying to adjust to 20th century customs, which they find to be, as Kirk said, &quot;a primitive and paranoid culture&quot;. There's a couple scenes I really love, like the punk rocker (played by Kirk Thatcher) in the bus who refuses to turn down the radio, so Spock gives him a Vulcan neck pinch. It's also interesting to know the song played on the radio owned by the punk on bus was actually sung by Kirk Thatcher himself! Another of my favorite was Dr. McCoy attempting to save Chekov at the hospital and he gets really angry at the doctors because he thinks that 20th centure medicine is &quot;medievalism&quot;. It's definately a fun Star Trek movie to watch, but the problem I have with the Star Trek legacy is it's been thoroughly rubbed in the dirt, thanks to too many TV series spinoffs, like Deep Space Nine, but I always have been a fan of the original Spock, Kirk, McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, Chekov Star Trek, and of all the Star Trek movies I have seen, this one is my favorite.

0783243499|4.0|I realize it's not fair to compare a book and a movie; having said that, I'll do it anyway.<br />The book doesn't grab you so much as make you curious; you really don't like this guy, even in the first few pages, but you want to know why you don't like him.  Its length, in terms of scenes and delivery, is perhaps 3 times the movie's length.<br />Having pointed out where the movie falls short of the book, allow me to say that the movie is a pretty faithful reproduction of roughly 1/3 of the book.  If you read it first, you'll catch lines, see scenes, remember things from it -- but you'll feel disappointed at the ending.<br />You cannot, in modern market requirements, make a film that would accurately capture the entire book.  Fair enough.  This 1/3 of the book in film isn't terrible.  My one problem was the chainsaw scene -- a complete departure from the book, if my memory serves...!  The one flaw in an otherwise small but interesting and valuable gem of a movie.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Just for the tracks Freewheel burning, The Sentinel, Jawbreaker, and Love Bites this album deserves five stars.  The other songs are also very good, except for Rock Hard Ride Free, which reminds me of Living After Midnight and it feels too pop.  When the Night Comes Down and Heavy Duty are very good songs and I am glad that there is the live version of Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith, although I would have liked to have the live versions of Dreamer Deceiver, Dissident Agressor, Island of Domination, or Saints in Hell.  Are these available anywhere?  Buy this album, but beware of the next one, Turbo. It is not for everyone...
B00005O5N1|4.0|This film is based on the best selling book by Helen Fielding about a 32-year old single British woman's comical romantic adventures.  I assume that the book was full of sharp and witty observations that rang true.  I have a feeling though, that even though Renee Zellweger does an outstanding acting job in the lead role, the screenplay does not capture that spirit.<br />Ms. Zellweger is a fine actress and the audience can certainly identify with her search for Mr. Right as her biological clock keeps ticking along.  Hugh Grant is cast as her boss and lover with an aversion to commitment.  Colin Firth is cast as a stuffy barrister who is also interested in Bridget. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the story moving along and some of it is humorous, but just not enough to make this lightweight romantic comedy rise above the ordinary.  I, personally, would never have been interested without the draw of the book's reputation and the fact that I am fast becoming a Renee Zellweger fan. She's a delight to watch and her freshness shines in every single role she's ever played.<br />At 97 minutes, the film still seemed too long.  But please  nderstand that I'm not a fan of romantic comedy as a genre.  I like a film to have a little more substance than the ups and downs of a romance that the audience knows is going to work out for the best in the long run anyway.  There's a happy ending of course, but so what?  Sometimes though, a lightweight movie like this can be fun.  So, even though it was a bit too insipid for my personal taste, it can be enjoyed for what it is, some pleasant time that will leave you feeling good. Mildly recommended.
0788811355|1.0|Let's begin with a little math:  Artsy direction plus pointless story equals Oscars!  Not too bad, but really I don't see all the fuss about \\"The English Patient.\\"  I've studied the book, watched the movie several times, and still don't see what's so great about it.  Yes, it's pretty...even the burned German spy (now called English) doesn't look like a burned victim in ICU like he should look.  Yes, there's a love story. There's WWII for all those WWII junkies.  With all of this the movie is still boring, too long, and completely  convoluted.  It may be artsy, but art is subjective.  I'd leave this one in the store and see other Oscar nominated movies from the same year such as \\"Shine.\\"
B0000048V8|5.0|The images and especially the music make this one of the greatest animated films I've ever seen.  Surprisingly, this film is much better than the book.  Worth every penny.
0679720200|5.0|Camus has a way with words like that of the finest of poets.  This brilliantly crafted story is a fine achievment in literature.  As you have probably read from the other reviews, The Stranger is the story of a man, Mersault, who enjoys only the sensual pleasures of life, if only for brief moments.  He does not love his companion and is totally indifferent to the death of his mother; he doesn't even know when she died.  He commits a crime on the beach and stands trial, but is convicted solely because he is detached from society--he is a stranger.<BR>   I have nothing to add to the plot because many have done so much better than I ever could judging from the reviews I 've read already.  I only have a few comments and suggestions.  <BR>   If you've never read Camus before, then this is the book to start with; it gives you a glimpse into the mind of a brilliant thinker, writer, and artist.  If possible, you should read The Myth of Sisyphus alongside(or even after) The Stranger.  You will have a better feel as to what Camus is all about, though I doubt anyone will ever really understand him.<BR>   The Stranger will have many question the nature of their own existence.  This is how powerful Camus's writing is. Overall, The Stranger is a profoundly beautiful work and it is one of my favorites.  Highly recommended.
B00005T5VE|5.0|There isn't more to say other than this is the best compilation of 90's music, Madonna puts together a rousing package of driving dance numbers and powerful ballads.  A must for any fan!
B000002H72|5.0|This cd is so good that I listen to it all the time and always ending up scratching it.  I think I've bought about 5 copies since buying the first one about 10 years ago.<br />Unlike anything you will hear on the radio today, this cd has harmony, melody, dark and interesting lyrics in copious amounts.  These attributes blend well with the band's short punkesque song structures (read modest musical skills).<br />This band's sound can best be described by its components.  That would be 50's and 60's style pop melodies.  Surf music is heavily borrowed.  Another obvious component is punk rock music.  Melodic and short punk tunes like the Misfits &quot;Skulls&quot; comes to mind.  The final obvious component is noise pop stemming from mid 80's bands like Jesus and the Mary Chain and Echo and the Bunnymen.  Jesus and the Mary Chain's &quot;Taste of Cindy&quot; and &quot;Some Candy Taking&quot; from their '85 album, Psycho Candy, sound like they could be snipped and placed on Doolittle or any Pixies cd.<br />I love how the pixies have picked and choosed their influences and develop a style that is ironic.  Goody two shoes 50's melodies meets counter cultural punk rock music.<br />Note:  Avoid expecting too much from Bossanova and Trompe Le Monde.  The songs are hit and miss.  The other 3 albums are excellent through and through.
6302426499|5.0|Such a beautiful film. I am speachless, the only thing to say that it explains the purpose of your life.
1558216847|5.0|This book is powerful, moving, and beautifully written. The daring escape made by the author and his comrades from the Russians and their adventures to freedom will make you laugh as well as cry.<BR> I have never read a book that was more full of adventure, bravery, and hope. It's not sweetened up with a mushy love story or anything, which makes it even more real.<BR> This is most definitely a must read for anyone wanting a new view on culture and heroism.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I have a habit of buying an album on one song and being disappointed by the rest of it. Not so this time. Room For Squares is an awesome assembly of creative, rich, and satisfying tunes. Mayer's influences are crystal clear (SRV, DMB, a dash of Hendriks), but he still sounds original. I've had the album for about a month and still listen to it everyday. I think the main reason I like this album so much is that it just plain makes me feel good. There's no pretention, just a wistful reflection on ordinary days in the life. I can't wait for Mayer's next album....
B00005RFQ5|4.0|Being a long time Prince fan, I own all of his cds. With that in mind, I review &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot;, Prince's billionth release. While not his worst, it's not his best either. I don't think he's made a truly remarkable cd since 1995's &quot;Gold&quot;. However, Prince can be counted on to make the kind of music he wants to make and not follow any trends. This is true on &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot;. He sounds like he's blended jazz, r&amp;b, gospel and rock this time out. Whatever your views on religion are this cd may or may not offend you. I'm not religious at all, so I find what Prince is singing about to be amusing. Not sure if he's making a point, or making fun, or what really. The music is alright. There are some interesting moments like &quot;The Work Pt. 1&quot;, &quot;Rainbow Children&quot;, &quot;1+1+1=3&quot;, &quot;Family Name&quot; etc. But there's nothing remarkable on this disc. I wasn't really annoyed by the segments between the songs where Prince's deeply modulated voice rambles nonsense. I just think Prince has become weird. I mean, he's in his 40's and he's making this kind of strange statement. It seems from his past recordings that he wears different political/social hats to the point where it's not clear what is going on. Mellencamp is much better at political and social statements I think. Anyway, another year, another Prince cd. Still waiting for him to get a grip though.
B000002C1W|5.0|i didn't really think pink floyd would put out any good albums after animals. but this is actually much better. right from the start of the abstract experimental &quot;signs of life&quot; i knew this was going to be a great album. i really never get sick of this one. who could get sick of &quot;learning how to fly&quot; or &quot;sorrow&quot;. it is a bit of a differant approach but very good. this is a great fusion of differant instruments and styles and always works for floyd. i think this is a great intoduction for anyone curious of the band. after all these years it still sounds rich and exciting.
630245333X|5.0|The rest of the movie will.....!<br />I've seen this move a great many times it used to be my all time fav movie at the ripe age of 4yrs(I'm now 16yrs), and well lemme tell you after not seeing it for a few years then watching it when I was 9yrs(In broad daylight)it scared me so much I thought for around 3months while lying in bed at the night, that the blob would drop from the ceiling(you'll understand this if you watch the movie)... This was one of the first and last horror movies I'll ever watch. But its worth a watch for horror fans...<br /> It really is a classic, I haven't seen the original version, but the effects in this movies are very good and well gross... There are several scenes so grossly gory that they will scare the living (...) outta ya!!! Its not really so much the gore that's scary, but the blob itself, you never know where its gonna be. This movie is full of suspense. But though I watched it many times as a child it is VERY innapropriate for children at that age... I wouldn't let them watch it, it'll prolly give them nightmares...<br /> I wont describe the movie itself, been done to many times... Just when you watch this don't expect to much(Cause if you dom no matter how good a movie is, you'll prolly be let down!!!)come in with an open mind and sit back and relax and and enjoy the show!!!<br />God Bless ~Amy
B000002C25|5.0|Noel Gallagher himself may be down on this album; artists have their privileges to evaluate their own work, after all.  But &quot;Be Here Now&quot; still sounds thrillingly huge, a symphonic-scale rock album that soars upward in a bubble of optimism.  &quot;D'You Know What I Mean?&quot; sounds like a call to arms-- very few tracks since the '60s, if ever, sound so full of apocalyptic excitement.  People constantly complain about the alleged &quot;banality&quot; of Oasis lyrics, but &quot;I met my maker, I made him cry . . .&quot; is a sublime rebuke worthy of William Blake.  &quot;Be Here Now&quot; invites being divided into movements, with the second beginning with &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, which introduces the theme of relationships with the hope of sailing together in the same direction, an idea which becomes aching by the time &quot;Don't Go Away&quot; arrives.  Then comes confirmation with the We-Shall-Overcome awesomeness of the four closing tracks.  Every song is long and loud; and, though the feel is different from the playfulness of &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; [I imagine part of what bothers Noel is the sense that Oasis lost the quirky romance and humor of those earlier songs] and though some individual songs may fade away in the 70-minute wall of sound, that doesn't necessarily hurt the album.The big anthems (tracks 1, 4, 8, and 10) anchor the album and the tracks around them flesh out their mood.  This is really a pretty radical approach today; Oasis doesn't have to repeat it but it wasn't a vain experiment.  &quot;Be Here Now&quot; makes most of (non-Oasis) 90s rock look like something you get up with a toothpick.  Listen to &quot;Magic Pie&quot; and see if this isn't a grand statement of hunger for greatness.  That's part of what separates Oasis from most other bands.  The other part?-- oh yeah, greatness.

B0000009UX|5.0|Elvis Costello's skill as a pop songwriter showed itself long before Imperial Bedroom.  He wrote earlier great melodies, he<BR>previously touched chords in his audience, and he had enjoyed some of his intermittent radio success long before this album's release.  But Imperial Bedroom remains one of his most important albums, because here he showed just how far he evolved from the angry young man phase of his earliest work.  The production is lush, almost rococo, and the tunes resonate with buried counterpoint and submelodies, offbeat harmonies, instrumentation just a hair shy of bombast, and lyrics which alternate among caustic commentary, wicked satire, and heart felt sentiment.<BR>This Elvis Costello incarnation is cinematic, the sound track to a hundred noir films not made.    If you think of Elvis Costello as only at his best with a simple guitar or a four piece band,<BR>or if you think that plush production equals lack of artistic integrity, think again.  This is one to own, yet it is unashamed in its studio gimmickry and lyrical melodrama.   This would be on my desert island disk collection.
B000056JYB|5.0|This album is the all time  greatest rock album . This recording is a must have for a true classic rock collection .

B000002KIE|5.0|okay, okay okay. people (...) call it 'corporate' but how can you be corporate in '77??? it wasnt like that back then. sure they were 'untalented' but so were nirvana, and they rocked. also, its not all about the talent, its about how they used it. they made some sweet songs every track on this cd is listenable after you give it a shot. this cd is the reason i got into punk rock. i mean, at the time of the late 70s who would you rather listen to: punk bands like the ramones, the clash, and the sex pistols OR styx, journey, kansas, boston, reo speedwagon........i rest my case
B000002JPA|4.0|I've owned this album for several years and am still pleased by its refreshing optimism and deft musicianship. This is truly an alternative to alternative. Instead of the anger and despair found in most heavy music, one finds affirmations of life and a thoughtfulness lacking on the Weekly Top 40. The most exhilirating tracks are &quot;Take the Time&quot;, &quot;Pull Me Under,&quot; and &quot;Under a Glass Moon&quot;. &quot;Another Day&quot; and &quot;Wait for Sleep&quot; are soothing and positive even in their quiet pensiveness. This may just always stand as the Theater's best album, and in my scant experience of the progressive genre is only rivalled by Symphony X's &quot;V&quot; in pure quality of musicianship.

B00005R2M3|5.0|I really love Shakira's english debut album.Who thought one person could have this much talent in them.This girl does it all.She writes,she sings,she produces,and she dances.Shakira put a lot into her first English album and you can definatly tell.From the start to the finish Shakira takes through the ups and downs of love.With mega dance songs like&quot;Whenever,Wherever&quot;,Objection(Tango)&quot;,and &quot;Ready For The Good Times&quot;,she proves she can have a good time in the studio and can be a fun pop singer.With slow balads like &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; and &quot;The One&quot; you can see she is a mature artist.Keep an eye out on Shakira cuz next year you will see a lot of her.Shakira has already exploded on the Latin Charts and she is definatly ready to take the US charts by storm.
1558216340|5.0|This book is one that completely engages all of your senses. It is frighteningly unsettling most of the time, yet the pages turn fluidly and without hesitation. The fact that these are people who live and have lived in these conditions is awakening. <br />Slavomir Rawicz's terrifying experience in a Russian labor camp and the path he survived while being delivered there, resembled true-life stories of concentration camps during WWII. Rawicz's escape from the labor camp was equally, if not more, shocking. It makes the life of any free person seem luxurious. <br />Rawicz's passion for life is beautiful! He carries himself through human brutality, skin and bones, and many more near death matches, while holding his will above it all.  Throughout the entire journey I was most touched by Rawicz's ability to digest the experiences he was up against moment by moment with out self-pity or complaint. Rawicz and the other lives in this book will remind anyone of the value of freedom and the drive that enables us to fight for it when we are caged.
6305428050|5.0|The 1980's brought us a lot of wonderful teen movies.  Adventures in Babysitting is definitely one of the best ones to come out of that decade.  The cast is wonderful (even the younger stars are good actors).  The plot is full of fun twists and turns.  The entire package is wonderful.  I have no complaints about this movie.  I'm thrilled that it has been re-released on DVD.

0380789019|5.0|For the most part this is a story about a person from our world that falls into a fantasy world and then goes on a quest. Not really new, but Gaiman breathes new life into the story. Gaiman's quirky, likeable characters help. So does his dark (but not to dark) sense of humor. Not to mention his ability to make the setting gothic and whymsical at once.

0743216458|5.0|This book gives the reader an upclose, detailed, and absorbing examination of World War II.  Ambrose tells the story in prose that is well informed by the best scholarship in military and political history.  At the same time, his writing is direct and accessible to all.  The reader gets to know the varied and valiant men of Easy Company, from their rigorous training before D-Day to the end of the war.  Indeed, Ambrose fills us in on how they spent their lives up to 1991 or so.  A fine achievement--to be recommended even to those who do not typically like war stories.
0785813500|5.0|I read a few stories by Poe: they include \\"The Murders of the Rue Morgue,\\" \\"The Raven,\\" \\"The Tell Tale Heart,\\" \\"The Cask of Amontillado,\\" \\"The Gold Bug,\\" and \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\". I thought all of these stories are very interesting.  As a junior in high school I thought I was going to have a very boring time reading Poe for a project we had to do for school. Surprisingly I was not bored with his writing style at all. Especially when I read \\"The Tell Tale Heart,\\" which was by far my favorite story by Poe thus far. Poe brings you into his work rather slowly, but once you get past the first page or two he sucks you into his writings.  <br />When you read his stories you wonder how a person can think of these sorts of topics to write about. You realize Poe's mind was definitely not one track thinking, but very open to various themes. Poe's writings are good for anybody to read, especially if you are into sick and twisted stories.<br />Poe may not seem to be very much of a fright story writer nowadays, because we have so many movies with amazing special effects. But after you read Poe and realize what time he wrote in you think he is a pretty spooky writer. <br />In my mind Poe is an amazing author and I come from a generation where we have substituted movies for books. Poe is a must read author some time in your life, so take a minute and instead of watching Texas Chain Saw Massacre read one of Poe's stories and you will feel like you accomplished something more meaningful.
B00003CXXS|5.0|When I first watched Jurassic Park 3, I didn't think it was any good. In fact, I was amused that so much money could be poured into a movie and yet It still stunk. My whole opinion has since changed once I learned of something very few people are aware of. <br />JP 3 was written, directed, co-stared and storyboarded,  entirely by raptors. Its true, they do have a superior intellect (well almost)! There are a few rumors floating about in the Hollywood circuit that they had some help by primates, some have even gone so far as to say the star of &quot;Dunstin Checks In&quot; ghostwrote the screenplay. I can't speculate on that, but all I know is that they work for stagehands and the occasional backrub (Hollywood better take advantage of them now before they go and form unions). Although raptors have yet to master the fine art of 3D animation, they sure as hell are giving Hollywood directors a run for their money. Bravo!
B000002WYT|5.0|Without any shadow of a doubt, Dave Matthews Band's 1996 release &quot;CRASH&quot; is my personal favorite album. I love all of this band's works of musical art, but &quot;CRASH&quot; remains my favorite.<br />The lyrics and music blend into this perfect harmony of soulful bliss for the ears. You'll love the jams and the creative thought found here, whether spoken or played.<br />I don't think it gets much better than a CD that contains &quot;So Much To Say,&quot; &quot;Two Step,&quot; &quot;Too Much,&quot; &quot;#41,&quot; &quot;Say Goodbye,&quot; and so many more. They are all excellent songs, each on their own as well as together. Everything fits together so nicely on &quot;CRASH.&quot; It's a beautiful thing.<br />I suggest you add this album to your collection as soon as possible. It will be fully complete with this.<BR>Enjoy!
0790737094|5.0|If you liked the first Lethal Weapon, you'll LOVE Lethal Weapon 2. There's more action, more drama, and the acting and plot is so much better and the villians are so much more fun to hate. This movie is so excessive, especially considering the punishment Gibson went through in the last 20 minutes of this film. The plot gets thicker and Gibson gets angrier when he finds out more to the story of what really happened to his wife. Danny Glover is still great, I'm sorry, but you HAVE to love the toilet scene. The bond between these two is tighter than ever and you can feel a real closeness both onscreen and offscreen. The entry of Joe Pesci is hilarious. Some people find him annoying, but I thought he was great with all his complaining about getting the wrong fast food. Very well written and a lot of build up to the end. I don't see how anyone couldn't love this movie. Beware of the &quot;Rubber Tree!&quot;
B00005R2M3|1.0|OK first off I really like all her Spanish stuff and was really excited when I heard she was making a CD in English. I loved the first single and was eager to buy it-- but then I heard it. <BR>In lots of the songs she doesn't seem to show emotion like any other singer would. I'm not critizing her, but I'm not too sure if she exactly understands what she's saying. She sings at the same speed as if the songs were in Spanish which has shorter words and is easy to speak fast and understand. (I've been taking Spanish for 5 years now). What I mean by \\"no emotion\\" is that if you don't know what you're singing it's hard to sing it like you do and not sound [bad]. <BR>So if you like the sound and don't mind if it's in another language (even though on this album it's hard to tell it's English) get ?Donde Estan Los Londrados? It's the best Spanish album out there.
0553573403|5.0|I was pretty blown away by this book.  A wonderful book filled with reality mixed with fantasy.  Some parts in this book are crudely real as to how the kingdoms were ran and the game of thrones was played.  Each character is not all good or all bad, they have a collage of both, like most people do.  Magic and fantasy creatures do not play as much of a part in the first two books.  The third book has more fantasy, however the reality in this book and the second one is gripping.  I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!  It takes alot to capture and hold my attention.  You never know what is going to happen.  If you have read and enjoyed the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; you most likely will enjoy this series.
0736041850|5.0|There is a HUGE number of books dealing with anatomy for both athletes and artists.  As an artist interested in anatomy, I have studied many of them, but I can say unequivocally that Frederic Delavier's book is without a doubt the BEST I have ever seen.  Athletes will find this book particularly good because it is so easy to read and understand. This book should be required reading for artists as well, because it is probably the FIRST book ever written on the subject which seriously demonstrates in TRUE, COMPREHENSIVE detail the working muscles of the FEMALE body.  Historically in art the female body is often portrayed WRONG, from a distorted masculine viewpoint--either like the ugly, distorted men-women of Michelangelo, or else the Vargas-Elvgren-Playboy fantasy pin-up idealization. Delavier corrects this error in perception and shows us the RIGHT viewpoint.  He has a profound understanding of not just medical anatomy and strength training,  but also of the classical tradition in art. His superb 3-way rendition of the Farnese Hercules, which has been drawn by many great artists like Rubens, clearly proves this.  After studying this book, I fail to see how any artist can not agree that it clearly outclasses all the other books on the market today.  Any artist or person interested in physical training--as well as medical and sport professionals--will also find it a really excellent book. I look forward to Delavier's future publications.
0553106635|4.0|Definitely recommended for those enjoying the Wheel of Time.  DO NOT get attached to the characters.  You never know what is going to happen next.  This series has kept me on the edge of my seat!  It takes alot to catch my attention and hold it.  This one does not seem as good as the first two of the series, but I find myself anxiously awaiting the next book.  Crude reality mixed with fantasy - REMARKABLE.  Thanks Mr. Martin!
0385505833|4.0|A nice book to get you back into the spirit of Christmas, not totally 100% as good as the usual law type books He (Grisham) writes, but a nice little book for Christmas.
B000021YQV|5.0|The first System Of a Down song I ever heard was Chop Suey, and like most people, it shocked me.  It was weird yet melodic.  But the mainstream aspect of it turned me away, because if it's on MTV then I don't appeal to it.  But after being introduced to some more of SOAD from internet and took a gamble and picked up the CD.  And the first track &quot;Prison Song&quot; got me hooked. The sudden rhythm changes and brilliant timing and song writing was exactly what I had been looking for.  Then CD definetely appeals to me.  For those who like easier listening and catchy hooks from mainstream MTV music, then you might not like this.  But take a gamble and buy it or download some songs and you could easily be surprised.  Standout tracks include Prison Song, Aerials with its beauty and great songwriting, Bounce with its overall weirdness and hilarity (in my opinion), Science with supberb timing and good vareity of rhythm and intensity, Toxicity (Self Titled Track) with some of the best drumming heard on mainstream these days, the drumming came at me like Basket Case when I first heard it, X, and Shimmy with its catchy and humorous chorus.  You won't be dissapointed I think, and maybe it isn't as long lasting as Nirvana, but it kicks major @$$ to me at this moment.  Take a gamble.
B00005QDW1|5.0|When i heard &quot;Hey Baby&quot; on the radio for the first time, i asked myself &quot;is this really No Doubt?&quot;  It was such a departure from anything they had done in the past that i was almost shoked/mortified.  One of the few bands i really had grown to love was leaning too far to the left.  But for some reason,  grew to love it.  The killer chorus maybe has something to do it.  I bought the album the monday before the release date and have been listening to it since.  &quot;hella good&quot; is the highlight of the album.  Dark/innovative/refreshing.  The beats are spaey and wouldn't be out of Timbaland's woods.  Nellee Hooper takes credit for the majority of the album's best cuts, including &quot;Detective&quot; and &quot;Running.&quot;  Gwen's vocals in &quot;Running&quot; is smooth, rhymical, and perfect for this production.  William Orbit produced &quot;Making Out,&quot; another departure from past No doubt tracks.  It's discoish, almost a more coherent remake of Madonna's &quot;American Pie.&quot;  &quot;waiting room&quot; is brilliant in its own right.  Never heard nething like it, and the chorus backed up by prince is fitting.  There's a few tracks that are &quot;NO DOUBTY&quot; ie &quot;Dont let me down&quot; and &quot;Platinum Blonde Life.&quot;  both sound like 80s pop classics.  Overall, this is NO doubt's creative masterpeice.  Gwen's vocals are confident here than in any past productions.  The band exudes a sense of free-spirit and this album is a reflection of just that!
B00005QK3W|5.0|This album reminds me of some of McCartney's earlier work in terms of the feeling I get when I listen to it.  Paul's vocals are unbelievable - this album is definitely full of soul and raw feeling on McCartney's part.  I feel his aliveness in this album - it is &quot;classic McCartney&quot; at his best.  Additionally, he sounds like he's in his 30's rather than his 60's.  Amazingly, his voice sounds better than it did in his last few albums.  From a Lover to a Friend is fantastic, there are moments during the song that is reminiscent of some of the raw sounds of Wild Life.  McCartney seems to be getting back to his roots with this album - I&quot;m getting it for myself and for a few friends who said they want it.  Go Macca!
B000001DYA|4.0|Blue Cheer were apparently one of the defining bands of the 60s &quot;acid rock&quot; movement, but these days they don't seem to get the respect afforded to others like Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and the Doors. This album pretty much explains why. Opening with a chugging, metallic cover of 'Summertime Blues', Vincebus Eruptum sets out to be a power trio tour-de-force, but it lacks some of the finesse of those other bands. The guitar is overdriven and fuzzed-out, the bass and drums pound frantically, and it's all captured in great lo-fi production. Three of the six songs are covers. The band's own songwriting is minimal - the songs they wrote (like 'Doctor Please') tend to dissolve into maniacal acid jams, which depending on your tastes could be exhilirating or tiresome. Most of all, Vincebus Eruptum just sounds like three lads having fun at high volumes. I can't quite put it up with the best work of that era, but nevertheless, it is an enjoyable work.
B00005QDW1|2.0|Unlike Tragic Kingdom &amp; Return of Saturn (both of which retained a spot in my 5 disc carousel for 6 weeks ) Rock Steady does not work for me. Could it be that irratating reggae groove on more than one track? Could it be that I bought this CD the week of its release? (I bought the others months after their debut and loved them) Am I getting to old to be hip? -- I don't think so. It's just this &quot;the disc is not what I expected of No Doubt after ROS.&quot; <BR>No Doubt , No Doubt wherever you are!?
B00005QG9J|5.0|Some people around here seem to enjoy complaining that Morning View doesn't &quot;rock&quot; as hard as Incubus' previous albums. I bought this with that in mind, and was pleasantly surprised to find that there is a lot of good solid rock material on here. The first three songs - including the single 'Wish You Were Here' - are fine forays into the heavy, energetic pop-metal that the band has heretofore specialized in. It does become a little weirder after that. There are druggy moments ('Just a Phase'), jazzy jams ('Are You In?') and an all-acoustic song ('Mexico'). But really, the varying textures, tempos and moods all serve to maintain interest over this near-epic album. The closing song probably draws the most disparate reviews. 'Aqueous Transmission' is a seven-minute piece featuring a ko-kyu (sort of Japanese mandolin) and a string section, dreamily hypnotic. It is a nice counterpoint to the rest of the album. Some of the things that make this disc nice are what it isn't - there's no rap, no sludgy detuned guitars and not much whining angst. I would say that Incubus are one of the few bands today that continue to follow their own instincts, and for that they should be praised.
B000002UB3|5.0|Starting with &quot;come together&quot;,one of their all time greatest,then on to &quot;something&quot;,the second most recorded song in history(only behind &quot;yesterday&quot;),this incredible album just never lets up,and by the time you get to &quot;the end&quot;,you realise you just listened to a masterpiece of music!(The fact that abbey road has sold 30 million copies worldwide to date should just about say it all! Rock on George,wherever you are!)
B00005JKT8|3.0|Kate McKay is a successful business executive for a big market research company, her life is turned upside down after meeting Leopold, the Duke of Albany from the 19th century who accidentally followed her ex-boyfriend Stuart back through a time portal.  When sparks fly between these two and love develops, how will they ever make the relationship work?<br />Kate &amp; Leopold is one of those movie with a very deceiving trailer, the kind that makes the film looks more interesting than it actually is.  Don't get me wrong, it was an ok movie...for the first hour, but somewhere in the middle it took a nose dive.  What ruined the experience for me is towards the end when they start trying to explain the time traveling with all the techno-babble, and it plays about half an hour too long.  The characters are likeable for the most part, Hugh Jackman is especially charming as Leopold, handsome and chivalrous, I really enjoyed his performance.  Meg Ryan on the other hand is boring, her portrayal of Kate is the same as all the other romantic comedy roles she's done in the past (i.e. You've Got Mail, Sleepless In Seattle, When Harry Meet Sally, etc...)  I think it's time for her to start branching out to other genre, she's just not very exciting to watch any more.  Breckin Meyer plays Kate's brother Charlie, an out of work actor, he had all the great lines and funny dialogues in the film; unfortunately Liev Schreiber was quite underused as Stuart, I would've liked to see him more.<br />Sweet, filled with plot holes, and ultimately forgettable, Kate &amp; Leopold is your standard romance comedy you've probably seen a hundred times before.  I recommend waiting until it comes on video, otherwise catch an early show if you must see it in the theater.
B000059H9E|5.0|Almodovar here shucks his tendency to blend campy sexuality and what he calls &quot;screwball drama&quot; for a strong work that instead fuses intense, real eroticism and the violence of a thriller into a powerful drama of fever-pitch emotionality.<br />Victor, born on a bus in a more typical Almodovar opening sequence featuring Penelope Cruz as his mother, is a loner and a man on the edge.  He stalks Elena, a junkie-prostitute-drug dealer and forces his way inside her apartment.  When two cops subsequently bust her for possession, they don't count on Victor, there with her, who pulls a gun on the cops in a scene that ends with one of them being paralyzed from a shot to the base of his spine.<br />Victor is nabbed and sent to prison.  On his release, he discovers that Elena, whom he still lusts for, is now married to the paralyzed cop.  And of course Victor cannot leave well enough alone.<br />It's the interplay of the second cop, the second cop's wife, Victor, and Elena that brings the emotional fluids here to a boil.  The story development including surprising revelations establishes a momentum that results in a climax more than worthy of the preceding events, and that more than justifies the label of thriller for this film.<br />Lust, jealousy, murder, betrayal--all the juicy stuff that thrillers are made of--are, in the hands of a unique Spanish director, given a searing life of their own.  It's truly a wonder to see this perfect mesh of out-of-control emotions, Spanish culture, and dazzling eroticism.<br />A brilliant film.  Although All About My Mother is superb, it is more a return to Almodovar's sensibilities.  Live Flesh is unique and is even unique for Almodovar.  This makes it really special.
B00005QZWI|5.0|After listening to this amazing soundtrack to &quot;The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring&quot;. I just know that the movie will be good!  The whole soundtrack has a mystical pagan sort of feeling.  I wasn't enitirely sure that Howard Shore could do something like 'Lord of the Rings', considering he usually does scores for films such as 'The Score', 'Silence of the Lambs', 'The Cell', 'Dogma', etc.  I would think they'd want to go with John Williams on this one, since he's defintely proven his ability to do fantasy scores with 'Haryy Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised with Howard Shore!  This is a excellent soundtrack, ideal for a film such as 'Lord of the Rings'.  <br />This music has a great way of setting the mood.  I've heard numerous movie critics comment on how wonderful the music was and how it was extremely helpful in setting the mood.  Critics don't usually bother with commenting on the score, so that tells you something; this must be a good soundtrack!  Some of my personal favorites on this soundtrack are 'Concerning Hobbits', a very ubeat and magical piece.  'Many Meetings', 'The Breaking of the Fellowship', 'The Rings Goes Sounth', and others (that I just can't remember) are also my favorites.  Actually, it looks like the whole soundtrack is my favorite!<br />When I heard that Enya would be recording two new songs for the 'Lord of the Rings' soundtrack, I went nuts! Enya and 'Lord of the Rings' seem like a perfect match!  The music in 'Lord of the Rings' is just the kind of music that Enya does best!  Her beautiful voice will defintely match the intrigue, magic, and mystery of 'Lord of the Rings'. 'May It Be' is another beautiful song from Enya. Her voice is gorgeous and the lyrics are magical, just like 'Lord of the Rings'. The orchestration is just fantastic, no wonder 'May It Be' is the number #1 download on Amzon.com!  Enya's other song on this track 'The Council of Elrond' is pure magic.
B0000017CA|5.0|Wow! I can't begin to tell you how much I like this cd. Dax has one of the most insanely melodic and evil voices I have heard and the rest of the band is extremely tight too, especially the drumming. I listened to this band a couple of years ago and it was only until now that I was finally able to buy it, and it is as I remembered, brutal, beautiful, and utterly wicked. My faves would have to be \\"Scream of the Butterfly\\", \\"Bones of Baby Dolls\\", \\"The Mortician's Flame\\", and \\"What Color is Death\\". It's too bad this band will never be together again, but hey... you never know. I just bought Agents of Oblivion and only hope it can carry on as least a good chunk of Acid Bath's legacy.
B00003CY3W|5.0|Ghost World expounds one of least sugar-coated views of American surburbia the make the screens in recent years. Director Terry Zwiggoff is fascinated by the banal ugliness of strip-mall excess, and Ghost World takes place in a sort of nightmare American neverland - everything's coming up hamburger joints, garage sales, porn shops and hick-town headcases.  The town is never named, but the scnery will be familiar to anyone whose ever stepped outside an American city.  <br />Its a perfectly awful backdrop for one of this years sleeper gems, a brave, insightful and refreshingly different take on a fairly tired theme - the coming to terms with reality in late adolescence.  Enid (Thora Birch in an elaboration of her American Beauty role)and Rebbecca are high school grads who just about cope with their existences within Hicksville by berating everything and everyone.  And who can blame them?  This is American culture at it's most facile. Among there objects of fun is Seymour (Steve Buscerni),  an old record collecting greaseball whos lonely hearts ads the girls answer for fun.  <br />Its at this point the story begins to diverge somewhat. Enid and Rebbecca begin to drift apart, as Enid isolates herself more, hanging on to her determination not to play any part of such a facile culture, whilst Rebbecca is slowly forced by practicality in to compliance and submission.  Enid becomes fascinated by the pathetic Seymour (&quot;He's the opposite of everything I hate...&quot;) and a poignant relationship develops which becomes the focus of the film.  <br />Ghost World was a film whose course was very much charted during its filming - Seymour had originally been intended as only a peripheral character.  But the screen relationship between Birch and Buscerni was so strong as to encourage to director to change the film's emphasis completely.  The result is, by turns, halarious, poignant and its own way, tragic.  Zwigoff is clearly contemporary culture's worst critic and his view ofAmerica is as glib, if far more human , than that of Todd Solondz.  And its humanity which gets you here;  despite their flaws,  Zwigoff has genuine compassion for his ensemble of oddballs and its hard not to touched by their plight.   <br />    The films end is almost epigrammatic in its ambiguity - the Ghost World of the title a sort of dream existence which both Enid and Rebbeca have spent their teenage years floating in, refusing to aknowledge a terrifying reality.   The ending suggests that whilst Rebbecca has left this world far behind, Enid has forever been lost to it.  Its an ending which, like the film, has a perculiar poetry to it.
B00005RYQO|1.0|I didn't expect much going in to see this movie. I didn't get much either. I was shocked when this film turned into a major blockbuster hit. Why?. It was an awful movie with a ridiculous, out there script. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are the only things that hold this weak film together. It looked bad and wasn't even fun in the 'stupid fun' kind of way. It was just stupid.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I was waiting in anticipation for No Doubt's new album ever since the first time I heard the video-game type bleeps of the opening of &quot;Hey Baby&quot;. This whole CD is good, much of it is better than the lead single, but I don't think it met my high expectations. A four stars is appropriate, and if you like No Doubt, it certainly is a change of pace, but it is a good album overall.
0446605409|2.0|I began this book with great hopes, but was very disappointed. First of all, I found John Corey tedious, with his constant wise cracks and gods-gift-to-women behavior.  I kept waiting for the &quot;mind twisting suspense&quot; to happen, but it never did.  The story line was weak, with Corey deciding who the murderer was in the middle of the book, and then we just get to watch him act out his revenge, without any real proof or justification till almost the end. I guess we're just all expected to cheer for Corey, but he's so obnoxious and so vicious, that I found myself hoping he was wrong!  Nothing is &quot;hair-raising&quot;, except his sadistic behavoir towards the murderer.  I seriously doubt that I'll waste money on any of DeMille's other books.
0525946284|5.0|At a time when the CIA and Special Forces are fighting the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and terrorists, patriotism and heroism is back in style. Ken Follet takes us back to a romanticized version from fifty years ago, with a thriller about espionage, Resistance fighters, SOE, MI5, Gestapo, and the SS.<br />This is a very familiar setting and theme. Fifteen years ago, Larry Collins' &quot;Fall from grace&quot; did an excellent job of creating for the reader a cat-and-mouse game of spies, agents, and Resistance fighters attempting to pave the way for D-Day. It remains a definitive piece of Resistance fiction. And the &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; film earned worldwide popularity with its collection of misfits taking on the German elite in their lair.<br />&quot;Jackdaws&quot; is a rich blend of both of these, with the usual dashing, handsome and beautiful, sexy, multilingual,  heroic, tormented yet highly motivated characters on both sides of the conflict. Follett makes full use of our fascination and respect for people who for the right reasons put themselves into terrible situations, fictional, semi-fictional or historically accurate.<br />Some readers have and will decry the chauvinist or simply politically incorrect use of the strange group of women  Follett assembled to sabotage the critical German communications link immediately before D-Day. For me, it is another interesting twist on an old, oft-worked theme. Sure, Follett's lesbian characters are drawn with a man's hand, but authors have always struggled to reach outside their own experiences, even if stereotypes necessarily result. And scenarios stretch reality, but fiction has that right as well.<br />Jack Higgins used to do a good job with this genre, before he went over to more modern times and the IRA. Follett remains a first-class writer of World War-based fiction. And &quot;Jackdaws&quot; will not disappoint.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|I havent seen this movie since it was in theatres, and since, i have been waiting impatiently for the video. When i did see it, i found the photography to be excellent; there was so much vivid color and changes in the types of photgraphy used. The music (although not orginal) was used very well in the movie, and had been recreated to fit well with the story. What i liked best was the fact that the main characters actually sang in their own voices, instead of lip-syncing the entire thing. Nicole and Ewan have wonderful singing voices-they should use them more often. By the end of the movie, all my senses were in overload... it is an excellent movie, but it does make you a bit dizzy by the end!
B000002WYT|5.0|There is no way words can describe how good this album is.  This cd will never get old. Dave Matthews is a true genius.  All of the band members have great musical skills.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|The CD escape much be one of the greatest cd's I have listene to in a while. Both Spanish and English makes this cd come to life.  If you wanna get up and dance this is the cd.  Oh, plus it can't hurt that he is totally gorgeous! ahh I just love  him, I am like the #1 fan! haaaa anyways awesome cd, pick it up today
B00002E23E|5.0|First of all, this is a great movie. Maybe it wasnt the best performance Zeppelin gave, and maybe it has some editing problems. NEVERTHELESS it is Awesome! This movie will change your life. This is the greatest rock concert movie of all time, period. Ignore Leonard Maltin and the others, the fantasy sequences work. And they add to the movie. The DVD really brings out the vivid colors and the sound is great. You can see the details and I heartily recommend it. The fantasy sequences dont interfere with the concert footage and they give you insight into the personalities of the band members. Jones is a dark avenger riding through the graveyard at night in a midevil village. Plant a king Arthur who finds a sword and a fair maiden after a journey through the forest in the springtime. Page a sorcerer who meets himself on the mountain in the dark forest. And Bonham, a pool playing, beer drinking, car racing family man. This concert still holds up today and there is nothing like it. Ive watched it over a 100 times over the last 10 years and I still never get bored of it. There's always something new to see. It ranks up there with Star Wars and The Wizard of OZ, an all time classic. This movie is a gift, from Thor and his band LED ZEPPELIN.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. My wife was baking cookies at the time we watched it, and I heard several loud bursts of laughter coming from the kitchen from her just listening to it.<br />I almost had an aneurysm on the &quot;singing to the bird&quot; scene. Had to rewind several times. The princess simply steals the show here, and in the &quot;Matrix&quot; scene. &quot;This would be a lot easier if I weren't color blind&quot;, and several other Eddie Murphy ad-libs also are worth good laughs.<br />Adults and teens will get more from the humor, although I'm sure little kids love the animation. I personally don't let my little kids watch movies with so-called &quot;mild&quot; profanity, so they didn't see this one. (I think there's only two words).
B00005Q45W|4.0|Listen to the poetry. Listen to the voices. Listen to the background. Until recently I had left Cohen behind. My mistake. It's nice to listen and be rewarded. You will enjoy.
B00003CXXS|4.0|I first saw this movie in the theater on July 24. I cant say that I was disappointed. It was great fun and action. The main reason I went to see Jurrasic Par 3 was the fact that Sam Niell was staring in it. He is one of my favorite actors. His performences in The Hunt for The Red October and The Piano are outstanding. <BR>I give Jurassic Park 3 four stars. It has alot of action, a great deal of CG dinosaurs and graphics, and is alot of fun.<BR>The DVD itself is excelent. It has a great array of extras. &quot;New Dinosaurs of Jurassic Park 3&quot;, &quot;A Visit To ILM&quot;, a commentay with the special effects team, and much more.<BR>Anyone who is Jurassic Park fan should own this DVD.
6301543408|4.0|Considered almost universally (no pun intended) the worst of all Trek movies, it may not be the best, but in my own opinion it is certainly not the worst. I won't give spoilers on the plot, but its one that is certainly appropriate for Star Trek. The banter and humor between Kirk, Spock and McCoy is top-notch and the speical effects are adequate. Overall, an above-average entry into the Trek movie collection.

0380973650|5.0|How can I review a book such as 'American Gods'? Well, let my say that this is Neil Gaiman's deepest and most impressive work I have read. I read many of his tales, and I believe that there is no author who has his talent for creating modern legends, and modern mythologies. So saying it's his best book should give you a rough idea how much I liked this book.<br /><br />'American Gods' has a main story, and a back story. The main storyline evolves around Shadow, an ex-con who is hired by an enigmatic character called Wednesday to be his bodyguard. It takes Shadow some time to realize it, but apparently Wednesday is trying to enlist many odd people all around America for a war.. these people, Shadow finds out, are in fact the old gods from various mythologies. The war is a war of old gods against the new gods... gods of the media, computers and the internet. I would not elaborate much on this storyline, because I don't want to ruin it.<br /><br />The back story examines ideas which Neil Gaiman likes to explore.. what is belief? what are gods? what happens to gods when there is not so much belief anymore? The book is filled with ideas and characters from so many mythologies.. I'm sure I missed many of these anecdotes, most are not explained at all. This creates such a deep background.<br /><br />The book has such a feeling of loss, of old passing away, and new things waiting for their own demise..  this held me captivated, I could not put the book down until I finished it.<br /><br />To summarize: I wholeheartly recommend this book - but beware, as it is definitely not light reading.
0679805273|4.0|Yet another great learning experience by Dr. Suess. In ths book he tells kids that if they reach for their goals and never give up on trying that they will go where they want in life. Kids don't know that though. They just know that if they try they might get to go to some place in the book. The best line, and the last line in the book is...And NEVER mix up your right foot with your left,&quot; and things should work out. How true is that if you put it in a more complex way?
0060278234|5.0|I just finished Sabriel a week ago, and didn't know that there was a sequel. While searching the site for Sabriel so I could write a reveiw, I found Lirael, and was overjoyed that there was a sequel.<br />I can't quite say that this book is better than Sabriel, because the excitement of the book doesn't really start until the last few chapters. The first two parts were fairly boring, basically just an introduction to the characters.<br />The book is divided into three parts, the first being about Lirael. She is a fourteen year old Clayr, and somewhat of a misfit because she lacks the sight. After an encounter with the Clayr twins Sanar and Ryelle (who readers will remember from the first book) she acquires a job in the Library, where she gets into several intresting ordeals.<br />Jump foward four years. This part of the book opens with Prince Sameth of the Old Kingdom, who is currently going to school in Ancelstierre, and town on the other side of the Wall which is fairly devoid of magic. After a cricket game, he and his schoolmates get attacked by the necromancer Hedge, seriously wounding himself and Nicolas. He later goes on a quest to find Nicolas, and run away from his duties as the Abhorsen in waiting and the rule of his commanding sister. Later in this part of the book, the nineteen year old Lirael is sent on a quest by the Clayr.<br />In the final part of the book, Lirael and Prince Sameth join forces to find Nicolas and send Hedge into death. This book has AN AMAZING surprise ending, which is mostly why I gave it five stars. (By the way, the book is continued in Abhorsen, which I'm waiting for VERY IMPATIENTLY. I suppose you could say that Lirael doesn't really have a real ending)<br />Note: If you plan on reading both this book and Sabriel, read Sabriel first because this book totally gives away Sabriel's ending.
0679882820|5.0|Mr. Brown can moo, can you? If you want a good laugh definetly read this book. It teaches kids the sounds animals make but ith a twist (like popping corks on horse feet) while having fun with it. It also teaches memorization because it asks questions like  Mr. Brown can make a sound like a fish kiss -pip! can you? Mr. Brown can make the sound of a hippo chewing gum -grum grum grum, can you? It's quite a funny book, but a good one to read too.

630027179X|2.0|Set in a mythical land called Camelot, Excalibur is John Boorman's vision of the Arthurian legend.  Loosely based on Mallory's Le Morte D'Arthur, the film chronicles the legendary King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.  Taking us with the sword Excalibur, we see Merlin handing it to Uther, who uses the sword for his own selfish means.  After that, Uther places the sword in a boulder, which only the future king will be able to remove.  Along comes simple Arthur, knowing nothing of the legend, who pulls the sword out to save himself a thrashing for losing Kay's sword.  Therefore he is destined to be crowned King, with the great sorcerer Merlin as his esteemed guide.<BR> Soon after, Guenever enters the picture.  Boorman depicts her as being gypsy-like, and largely lacking in any developed personality (not that Arthur had any either).  Guenever inevitably betrays Arthur with the invincible knight Lancelot (who ironically gains his power from his virtue).  An emphasis is placed on their sordid relationship, and the Garden of Eden scene is symbolic of tasting the forbidden fruit (adultery) and being propelled from the garden of paradise.  The sins of Arthur's father, Uther, come back to haunt him in the form of a she-witch named Morgana, his sister.  Morgana imprisons Merlin in ice in \\"the realm where all things are possible\\". After plenty of poor acting and misty special effects, punctuated by sporadic flairs of grandiosity and poorly built upon drama, Morgana's son by Arthur battles against Arthur and they mortally wound each other.<BR> I disliked the movie, perhaps because I previously read a book called The Once and Future King by T. H. White that chronicled the Arthurian legends much more realistically.  The book gave the characters actual personalities, while the film made them rather flat, heavily dependent on the way we had already built the mythical characters in our minds.  The movie was unrealistic to an almost surreal degree, portraying the Arthuriantime (if there was such a time) as being both a dream and a nightmare at once.  The dark battle scenes and incestuous scenes convey the nightmare side.<BR> The actors were terribly wrong for the parts.  Their painful self-consciousness makes them appear ludicrous, while the actor playing Arthur had no depth whatsoever.  They just did not appear serious about making the film-it almost came off as a joke.  While it is understandable why the movie should be condensed, it would have perhaps been better to only portray part of the Arthurian legend rather than packing it all into a clumsy story treatment.<BR> On a more positive note, there were several lovely scenes (purely in the aesthetic sense) and some very skillful camera work.  However, this did not neutralize the poor aspects of the film, and overall I would only recommend this film for laughs (particularly Merlin's overblown persona).
B000021XR5|3.0|No. 4 has some really good tunes such as &quot;Sour Girl&quot;, &quot;Glide&quot; and &quot;Atlanta&quot;. For an album that was so rushed, it's more or less equal to half decent. It doesn't really have an evident sound like their previous albums do- Core is pure hard rock/grunge and Purple is full of mellow alternative styles, but I can't quite pinpoint No. 4. This one has some thrashy stuff complemented by some softer songs but it doesn't live up to their others. However, bands go through changes and not every effort is perfect. If you're a die hard STP fan, you'll probably want to buy this to complete your collection. Otherwise, burn it off a friend.
B00005NVT1|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Daft Punk's &quot;Discovery&quot;, so when I heard that a live album was coming out, I just had to have a copy. Turns out that all the stuff on &quot;Alive 1997&quot; is from &quot;Homework&quot;, Daft Punk's debut release. I hadn't heard many tracks from &quot;Homework&quot;, but if it's as good as this live performance, I'm ready to make my purchase.<br />The first thing you should know is that &quot;Alive 1997&quot; is a one-track, 45-minute long performace. Track listings and song structures are nowhere to be found. But, the surprising thing is that the album never seems to get too boring, dull or repetitive. The songs change so often and the beats never get tiresome. Another interesting thing about &quot;Alive 1997&quot; is the heavy amount of audience participation. Listen about two-thirds in to hear audience members whistling to the beat, as if providing their own sample. It's a really fun experience.<br />True, you're not going to hear anything like &quot;Discovery&quot; or its hit song &quot;One More Time&quot;. So, you might want to borrow a copy if all you have is &quot;Discovery&quot;. If you liked &quot;Homework&quot;, though, this album's probably meant for you. Plus, you get free stickers! :)
B00005QW5X|5.0|I loved this movie from the moment the opening chords played in the theater.  Excellent music, wonderful writing, truly inspired acting, and a production design that was exactly right in every single scene.  I won't take the time giving a synopsis, since so many others have done it better than I could.  I do have to say that the documentary &quot;Whether You Like It Or Not&quot; is wonderful and is a great addition for all the Hed-heads out there.  Most &quot;making of&quot; documentaries give a few token interviews and the director speaking over some behind the scenes footage.  This one, however begins at the moment John Cameron Mitchell met Stephen Trask and ends after the awards were won at Sundance.  The film is great, the documentary is just as good, and I love watching the select-a-song each morning as I get ready for work.  GO NOW and get HED(wig)!
B00005N9CV|5.0|Each Diana Krall album gets better.  As she matures as an artist, we become more impressed with her understated elegance, much like Peggy Lee's later work. Diana's version of &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot; is an INSTANT classic. Her best CD yet, I can't wait for her next!
B00005NQLP|4.0|This record came out during rock's punk/new wave phase and was dismissed by the critics of the day. I have always enjoyed this record (MAGICAL CHILD has long been a favorite) and I am glad it is back in print. It is not as good as \\"Songs for Beginners\\" or \\"Wild Tales\\", but it is better than \\"Innocent Eyes\\". The cd version is a nice addition to the CSNY canon.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This CD is a must buy! I have been a fan of Shakira since her previous album, &quot;Donde Estan Los Ladrones,&quot; this CD is a must have for all people who love good music.  She is not the next Madonna or Britney Spears, she is original.  Her Columbian accent is strong but beautiful in most songs, and the rhythm is very moving.  Such songs as &quot;Te Dejo Madrid,&quot; and &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; (which is a remake of 'Ojos Asi' from her last album) makes the CD worth buying as does &quot;Whenever Wherever&quot; her first english single.  I have this Cd in my car, and it is a great album for on the road.
B000002HRE|2.0|Those of you who like this album are probably sick of the people who don't, those who aren't 'true' Metallica fans saying its crap and that they've sold out. I can honestly say that regardless of anything else this gets a bad review from me because I honestly don't like it.<br />This was the first Metallica album I bought (all those years ago) when I first got into metal. Metallica were the second band I got into (I gave them another chance after this). I'd heard Fuel and thought it was a great song (I still think its a good song) so I bought ReLoad. I played Fuel about five times before listening to anything else on the album. But I listened to other stuff, and I thought it was just too slow. For weeks I listened, trying to like it. But I just couldn't.<br />My point is that I was a complete virgin to metal scene - I hadn't heard much else (the only band I was into before then was Iron Maiden who still remain to be my favourite) and I had no idea that this was supposed to be a bad album or a sell-out. As somebody who wasn't into anything much heavier at the time, as somebody who bought this not really expecting anything in particular (muscially speaking) I listened to this with an empty open mind, and I did not like it.<br />Now I'm a much more cynical metalhead into a much broader spectrum of metal from early 80s prog to death metal, meaning that if I'd bought this the other day I'd probably be slating it badly and screaming sell-out every other sentence. But its not that I can't recognise change, simply that I may not like the change, and as I said this was my first Metallica album anyway. I bought this with nothing to affect my opinion other than my personal taste. And I hated it.<br />(..)
B000002UV9|4.0|It goes without saying that recording a follow-up to one of the best albums ever (Operation Mindcrime) is no mean feat, but I feel that Queensryche have done it. Empire is a stunning piece of work, and if you're a fan of rock or metal then you're shooting yourself in the foot by not buying this album. First things first though, this isn't as good as Mindcrime - in my opinion nothing is - but it does have differences which set it apart, not just from Mindcrime, but from all of Queensryche's previous releases.<br />Sell-out? Did someone say sell-out? Probably not, but its as good a lead in as any. Some may ask, why the change in style? I guess the answer could lie in the fact that the band knew they couldn't top Mindcrime with their current formula, so they didn't bother trying. Instead, they went for a new sound, less of the metal and more of the rock. It would be unfair to compare this with Mindcrime since the sound is quite different (many people feel that this is the better album). The sound isn't THAT different though - you can still tell its Queensryche. But listen to Best I Can or Another Rainy Night (killer song!) and compare it with older songs like Take Hold Of The Flame, The Lady Wore Black or Eyes Of A Stranger and can definately hear progression and change in the style.<br />What put me off this album at first was the idea that it was more commercial. Coupled with the fact that I had been sorely let down by Rage For Order I was very worried that I wouldn't find another Queensryche release to even come near the quality of Mindcrime. At the very least I was, well, doubtful as to what I would get from the album, despite the rave reviews. But I was wrong. Queensryche can very justifiably take their place as one of the best bands around, as they had worked their asses off making this album.<br />More mainstream? Yes. But its not a sell-out. Its not like they're dropping the solos or rapping or anything. I think its stupid when fans of a band criticise them for changing. Change is inevitable (except from a vending machine), and if you don't like it don't buy it. The band don't have to check with their fans to ask if they can change. Admitedly it can be a bit naff at times (see Metallica or Sepultura) but here its a good change, and being 'softer' is no concern of mine since Queensryche weren't very heavy beforehand anyway. Slayer have proved that trying to stay true to your roots can result in boring half-hearted rehashes of older material. Queensryche on the other hand, are a band that have moved forward and the result can be seen in the impressiveness of Empire. It's a great album, and although I prefer Mindcrime and even Warning, I fully recommend it.r changing. Change is inevitable (except from a vending machine), and if you don't like it don't buy it.

B000002JNJ|4.0|The band obviously didn't find there own, unique sound until &quot;Vulgar Display...&quot;, but Pantera's debut album is still great. Between the crucnchy guitar riifs and Phillip Anselmo's screams, the band sounds very similiar to early Metallica. The title track opens with one of the best riffs the band has ever had. It is very similiar to classic Metallica, but it's still awsome. Still, the true excellence on this album comes with the track 'Cemetary Gates'. It remains one of Pantera's best songs of their entire career. It's not just a traditional metal song like most of the tracks on this album. It also has one of Dimebag's finest solos. His complex playing is displayed wondefully in that song. As a whole, this album isn't as great as Pantera's later albums, but it is essential for any fan of the band, or anyone who likes solid heavy metal. If you want Pantera's best, check out &quot;Vulgar Display Of Power&quot; and &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;. Still, you won't be dissapointed with this album.
B00005U122|5.0|Milwaukee, Wisconsin, July 23, 1999 - Roger Waters returned to the old familiarity of the arena venue for the first time in over a decade tonight to a frenzied rush of adoration by fans new and old.  On a day in which near-record 90-degree heat had the potential to dampen the fun, the skies above Milwaukee opened up for a fleeting thunderstorm followed by a deliciously cool western breeze which transformed the atmosphere and the mood of those lingering outside the venue, waiting for the chance to be let in at the appointed time.  Against the backdrop of an eerily clouded sky, the crowd had arrived early; it seemed no one wanted to miss one morsel of the visual and aural feast that was to come.<br />Upon walking in to the Milwaukee Auditorium, it was obvious those coming for a sensory spectacle would not leave disappointed.  The infamous \\"Q\\" sound system consisted of pods of speakers facing in every direction hung from the ceiling throughout the arena.  One was positioned above the stage.  Two large banks of speakers looking something on the order of tower speakers on steroids were even with the stage and on either side.  Another mass of speakers was centered directly in the middle of the auditorium, another pair on either side lateral to the soundboard setup (about three-quarters of the way back) and finally, one additional bank in the rear of the studio.  In short, a system with the ability to focus and direct sound anywhere the mixers wished.  Its potential uses brought a huge smile to my face in anticipation of what was to come.  Roger and his crew would not disappoint.<br />While walking past the soundboard, clear as a bell, there it was - the set list, posted for all to see.  I quickly scratched it down on my notepad and marveled at the choices as it mirrored my wish list.  As the Genie said, \\"you can have three wishes, if you don't take too long.\\"  My genie came through this night.<br />The crowd lingered in the aisles, some puffing away on cigarettes, othersmore potent herbal blends while others sought relief from the mundane of everyday life by imbibing on a large plastic cup of the local brew, freshly trucked in cold from the brewery.  Everyone seemed relaxed but there was an undercurrent of nervous tension.<br />The stage was set up to allow freedom of movement of all and the shadows of the players to be splashed against the huge canopy erected behind the stage.  No huge circle screens for projecting movies this time out.  But in its place, something far greater.<br />The same lights used to \\"paint\\" the wall in Berlin were brought in and situated above and behind the sound board and way up in the very back of the auditorium.  Any concerns about there being enough candlepower to light up the screen from that distance proved to be unfounded.  Never in thirty years of concert going, including Rogers' previous solos tours (KAOS and Pros and Cons) and all of the Floyd tours have I ever seen anything resembling this system, which converted images onto the screen other than in the usual television `streaming' manner, but rather like the old slide projectors from the `60's . . . with a `90's computer-controlled program that was a marvel to behold, as one picture faded into the other . . .<br />Finally, the lights dimmed, the crowd roared and the band broke into IN THE FLESH.  The lighting system kicked in and it was clear that early on and often the limits of the sound system would be put to the test.  The band immediately followed up with another classic from The Wall, ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL (PART I).  One thing was obvious from the outset . . . this was an eclectic mix of musicians, like a finely tuned sports team with a mix of veterans and even a rookie named Doyle Bramhall (Jr., son of the jazz drummer) taking in essence the role of a modern-day Dave Gilmour.  He would be tested early and often and scored more often than he stumbled; even the `glitches' were forgivable given that he would be called upon to cover DaveGilmour, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck licks.  His vocals were strong and reminded one of the Dave Gilmour of the video at the ruins of Pompeii.  His chops were strong, his staccato attack hacking away at covering the essence of his predecessors while obviously making these songs his own.  Keep an eye on this young man . . . if you catch this tour, you'll be able to tell everybody five years from now that \\"you saw him when . . .\\"<br />It would not take long for Roger to dive into the depths of his writing and performing repertoire by slowing things down for MOTHER off of The Wall.  With Katie Kissoon and her compatriot providing spectacular backup and background vocals, and excelling each and every chance given to take the lead, this would be an evening of sensual aural delight.  Is there a finer vocalist out there than Ms. Kissoon, with as wide a range, textual quality and depth of expression?  If so, I've never heard her.<br />In the background, the light show was ever-changing and perfectly timed to coordinate with the lyrics.  Timing was the key tonight, as Roger once again showed attention to detail by bringing together so many different media all at once that there can no longer be any lingering doubt as to whom is the master of this domain.  The eminent Mr. W. has reentered the forum, killed the lion and feasted on its meat with a delirious crowd of adoring supporters exhibiting their fanaticism by swaying, singing along, pumping their fists and in some cases, writhing in apparent rock `n roll ecstacy.  It was a community of like-minded souls that had come together to honor their spiritual guru as he returned to claim his rightful throne.<br />(...)<br />[Space limitations prevent reprinting this full review]
B0000024ZT|5.0|I am a 14 year old new Bruce Fan!  I first became interested in Bruce's music when I listen to Born to Run.  After that I found my father had a back load of Bruce records.  So one day I listen to all of his albums except for some new ones.  I thought Greeting was up there with Born to Run.  Everyone says Wild is better, but I must concur Greetings is better.  Each song is great in its own way.  Like Growing Up and Does this Bus stop at are great rock songs.  Lost in the Flood and It's Hard to be a Saint in the City are great songs that the lyrics make you think.  Greeting from Asbury Park, NJ is a essential Bruce buy.

B00003CXXS|3.0|I loved Jurassic Park III and I could hardly wait for the DVD to arrive from Amazon.  When I saw all the extras included on this DVD I literally began to froth at the mouth like a Spinosaurus bringing down a T. Rex.  As I went through the Bonus materials menu, however, I grew more and more dissappointed.  The features are fascinating, but they are short--way too short.  Most of them are only a few minutes long.  The bonus feature on ILM, however, takes the cake.  You have to navigate through some 10- 20 menus (I couldn't bear to count them), with four top-level menus, some of those then opening up into more menus three deep!  In other words, you'll be ready for a thumb transplant by the time you finish watching all the little features.  Now get this--some of all that navigation will get you THREE SECONDS of video.  I kid you not.  Many of those little menus will bring you less than a minute of video before you have to navigate some more.  Why?  I have no idea, but clearly none of the humans with very big brains who made this great movie set up the DVD.  A Velociraptor probably could have done better, if only those killing claws could work a computer.<br />Still, it's a great movie worth repeated viewings.  But don't buy the DVD for the extras.  One final note: although this is the &quot;widescreen&quot; edition, it doesn't look anywhere near the aspect ratio as shown in theaters, although I was too engrossed in the movie to detect any pan and scans.
B000001ESF|5.0|From the moment the funky sound effects begin on the title song, you're pulled into a whole other world that could have been created in the mind of drummer/lyricist Neil Peart (Ayn Rand has to get some credit as well since her novella Anthem has long been cited as an influence for the goings-on in 2112). One can hardly listen to the title song without pondering a world where music has been outlawed (this takes place mainly in Discovery and Presentation). <br />After that first great 20 minutes plus, it's on to a mixed bag of quality stuff beginning with &quot;Passage to Bangkok&quot;, which they continued to do live for many years. &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; makes a few references to actual episodes of the 60's television show (one of the best shows ever). &quot;Lessons&quot; belongs on any &quot;best of&quot; list for the band and the album ends with the powerful &quot;Something for Nothing&quot;.<br />Simply put, Rush was coming into their own with this album and it still ranks as one of the best even considering that they have about 2,000 albums now (well, maybe not quite that many but you get my point). Rush is not the kind of band to gather moss and this is a sound that would somewhat linger on the next album, A Farewell to Kings, and even less so on the succeeding Hemispheres. Those are good albums too, but enjoy this real gem in 2112. There's really nothing else like it.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Funny, funny movie. I had a great time with this one. This is one of those where I didn't see it in the theatre so I took a chance and bought it anyway on DVD. Thankfully, I had a great time with this one. Technically, the film looks sharp with great character animation all-around. Meanwhile, Shrek's a fun, well-cast movie with humor that will please both young and old, without going too over-the-top. I came unglued during the Gingerbread Man interrogation scene. Thankfully, this slick DVD has chapter stops so I could watch the scene again and catch the portions I missed while I was laughing so hard. And I knew I had a winner when I watched it again and the scene was just as funny.<br />Mike Myers is excellent as the title character and Murphy is a delight as Donkey. The DVD has some real nice extras. You should check it out.

B00003CXTG|1.0|Boring, stupid, banal, unneccessary and historically incorrect are all words that can describe this \\"epic\\" three-hour music video trash. (...)<br />You want to know what really happened December 7, 1941 in the form of a movie? Watch the excellent \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" (1970) where the evil (..Japanese) are REAL people with REAL motivations and the direction of the film is excellent, as opposed to this albeit slick Michael Bay (Armaghedon, Bad Boys) rubish. I'll rate \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" right next to \\"Patton\\" anyday. As for \\"Pearl Harbor\\"; let's just say I won't be \\"enjoying\\" this distasteful chick-flick at home anytime soon.<br />\\"Pearl Harbor\\" piddles on the men and women who LIVED the date which will live in infamy. I wish I could give it a rating of No Stars.
B00005QDW1|1.0|No Doubt used to be a really good band until rock steady came out there just a bunch of sell outs who play rap instead of rock/ska please dont buy this cd if you think its going to sound like all the other no doubt cd cause if you do you'll be really disappointed like me
B00003CX5P|3.0|Despite Jar-Jar and the kid from \\"Jingle All The Way\\" (yeah, he couldn't act in that one, either), \\"The Phantom Menace\\" is a pretty decent movie. In no way does it compare to \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" but it does hold its own in the Star Wars mythology. And with episodes two and three quickly approaching, \\"Phantom\\" will surely find its niche.<br />Besides, after watching it over again, \\"The Phantom Menace\\" began to grow on me. Maybe it's the podracer sequence or the lightsaber clashes with Ray Park's (\\"Sleepy Hollow\\", \\"X-Men\\") Darth Maul. Or maybe ol' George is just putting something in the water; I don't know. All I know is that \\"Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace,\\" once you get used to it, is pretty darn cool.
0385501560|4.0|Chuck Palahniuk continues to startle us with his unique voice in literature.  During a time when the world is at a peak of madness few of us ever dreamed, most of us seek solace in works of wonder, of wisdom, of elegance in writing - books such as the ones by the late, much missed WG Sebald, or Jose Saramaga, or Jim Crace, or Mark Doty.  But that level of this sublime needs comic relief.  And here is the wildest ride of mayhem, madness, and just plain imagination that one could encounter!<br />Reviewed so many times in this section, it is unnecessary to outline the characters or the plot. In ways, though they are succinctly and cleverly drawn, the people of this opus seem less important than the afterburn that follows reading &quot;Choke&quot;.  Sifted through this intricate maze of a sexaholic's dealing with his questionable heritage, his Alzheimer's stricken &quot;mother&quot;, his meanderings through countless sexual encounters and interactions with a hooty group of friends...sifted through this are eloquent musings on where we are today, members of a world gone nuts, and what we can do to survive it.  In Palahniuk's words: &quot;Every ddiction, she said, was just a way to treat this same problem.  Drugs, overeating or alcohol or sex, it was all just another way to find peace.  To escape what we know. Our education.  Our bite of the apple.  Language, she said, was just our way to explain away wonder and the glory of the world.  To deconstruct. To dismiss.  She said people can't deal with how beautiful the world really is.  How it can't be explained and understood&quot;.  Beautiful writing like this in the background of a story of mental mayhem is indeed wondrous.......and it makes this book very much worth reading for just about any-thinking-body.
0441172717|5.0|My favorite book from Dune serie is God Emperor of Dune; but this one is the first, and it opened our eyes to a new universe, a new thought.<BR>Really, it's a hard and complex universe with a lot of different people with them own objectives, ideas, fears, ambitions... Translate it from an extended universe to the city, the street... and you'll see it in a shorted scale. F. Herbert is talking about an extense universe but it's near in distance and relationship. It's not about far away worlds, forgotten worlds... it's near, it's between members of a great family with diferents thoughts and ambitions.<BR>All the incredible world of Dune itself is fabulous, the factions along the universe (the powers than tries to dominate or tries to update the human race), the fight of Atraides spirit against the terror...<BR>In the other hands you see how the climate, how the economy; works really hand-on-hand with politic and war; how the people tries to move inside a sea (sea of water or sand, it's not different) dominated for those forces.<BR>The Dune world is very close to us
B000050XEI|5.0|Quite simply, I could listen to this album for the rest of my life.  I'd always enjoyed Enya's music, but this alum is quite different from her previous work (those who say it sounds exactly the same are just desperate for something to complain about)  The grand scale of Orinoco Flow and Book of Day has been all but abandoned for a lighter, softer approach;  Enya is in chirpiest of moods on Flora's Secret, Wild Child and Silver Inches.  The deep brooding of Bodicea has also disappeared.  <br />The closest Enya comes to darkness on A Day without Rain is the haunting Tempus Vernum, meant to symbolize winter.  The title track is perhaps Enya's most beautiful, well constructed instrumental peice ever.  Enya and lyricist Roma Ryan have a unique songwriting immagination, that other artists would just deem stupid or un-hip.  The most beautiful lyrics are found in Only Time, One by One, and Flora's Secret; &quot;Summer snowflake/For a season/When the sky above is blue&quot;  So simple, yet profound and inspired.  <br />But the real jewel in A Day Without Rain comes at the very end.  Lazy Days is perhaps her best track ever, and she was wise enough to keep it to the end of the album.  Too many artists today shove all their best tracks to the beginning of an album, and leave the second half with scraps.  Enya leaves the best till last.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Not having the pleasure of being there to see this concert live, I must say that seeing it in the comfort of home with the sound system turned up to eleven is almost good enough. Buy this DVD.. you're going to love it!!! And while you're buying be sure to pick up a copy of Arrival to hear the newest music from the band. Kevin Shirley does a great job and the sound is super on the DVD and Arrival. This Journey takes you to a Higher Place and it's good good good!!
B00003CY5J|4.0|I literally just finished watching this DVD minutes ago.  I wasn't expecting much, but &quot;The Score&quot; was definitely an entertaining film.  Just to clear up a couple of things, there definitely ARE surprises, contrary to what the editorial review says- I guarantee you'll crack a smile during the ending of this movie.  And for some reason, a previous review labeled the ending as a &quot;shootout&quot;, which couldn't be farther from the truth.  Part of whst makes this movie stand out as above average is that it does't result to the cliche' ending that one might expect.  And that, in itself, is a surprise.  <br />The only real dissapointment was that the interaction between the &quot;big 3&quot; wasn't quite as magical as I had anticipated.  Not that any of the 3 were at all bad, but we've seen them do so much more in the past. The high point is an exchange between Brando and De Niro in which Brando begs for De Niro's cooperation.  Norton gives a quality performance, but it's nowhere near the standard he set with &quot;Primal Fear&quot;, &quot;Rounders&quot;, or &quot;American History X&quot;.  <br />If nothing else, watch &quot;The Score&quot; just for a chance to see 3 of the greatest actors alive (albeit not in their greatest performances). Oceans Eleven has nothing on this cast!
B000000OQF|5.0|This album is one that will live forever, when the Blink 182's and Creed's will die out. It's loud, raunchy, and it just plain kick's (...)! Axl's piercing vocals and Slash's incredible guitar riffs mesh perfectly to tell a tale of sex,drugs,and the police.No other band in history could make an album about such profane issues and be so damn good at it!
B00005QDW1|5.0|Like Garbage did with their recent third effort, No Doubt has released an album that ups the pop in their sound, something hinted at previously but now in full-blown effect here. Purists are going to hate this, but the fact is that No Doubt works best as a pop band--their forays into ska and punk are interesting, but songs like 'Hey Baby' and 'Hella Good' make one wonder why that waited so long to do a full-blown album of funk-pop. Mixing synthesizer funk, reggae, pop, New wave and a tolerable amount of ska, they glide through the record's program seamlessly, aided by first-rate production from Nellee Hooper, Sly &amp; Robbie, and Prince. Notable standouts include first single 'Hey Baby', 'Hella Good' and the Prince-driven 'Waiting Room', while frontwoman Gwen Stefani unleashes her inner-Cyndi for the set's best track, the exquisite Lauper-esque ballad 'Running'. While diehards would argue that the album's accessability translates to selling out , this stands as the group's best outing to date.
B00004YRQA|5.0|If you've ever had a non-Sony card die on you in the final act of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; like it did to me, you will buy a Sony card the next day. Expensive and reliable. You get what you pay for with PS memory. Spend the extra dough and have some peace of mind.
B000006OBQ|3.0|The magic of the original recording that, for me, fills me with the chills of having heard this album for the first time, everytime I hear it.<BR>That was listening to this recording on audio cassette. Not very good quality, but the essence of Frank and the music was enough.<BR>Then I got hold of the first CD a few years ago and fainted.<BR>Upon hearing about this new remastered cd and the addition of a new track, I was quick to grab hold of the possibility of hearing something I hadn't heard yet.<BR>In hindsight I am very disappointed in the quality of this recording. Something is lost. The mixing between tracks is rough, at one point Frank talks OVER himself. There is also a lot of background noise, almost like the microphone banging about. This was not heard on the first CD.<BR>The sound distorts at times. What was originally a perfect sound or moment has been changed, tweeked or altered for no other reason than boosting the ego of the sound engineer.<BR>I am taking this cd back to the store for the original cd.
0880794968|5.0|I'm new to tarot and this is my first deck and it's a good one to start with.  I ordered a book called \\"Learning the Tarot\\" by Joan Bunning, to go with this and it's the best book.  Very easy for a newcomer to understand.  The book describes this deck in particular so it's very helpful for me.  The deck is easy to handle and I'm enjoying the colors and artwork. Another great deck that is based on Waite's work is an Illuminated Tarot Deck (...). Beautiful colors of blue.  Check it out.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Everyone who give this movie less than 5 stars did not understand it and is never going to understand it. Many people claim its just a simple story shown in a complex and puzzling way. But thats not it. The story of the movie is not told IN the movie, its being unfolded in your thoughts whcih u make after seeing the movie (i strongly advise you to read the official website, cause if u dont u wont even come close to understanding it). <br />For me I can say that there has never been another movie that made me watch it 6 times and discussing/thinking bout it again even a year after watching it. And that is what a real movie should be about.
B00005U122|5.0|I've been waiting on the edge of my couch for this one for the last year and a half.I saw the show in San Antonio.It was like being in a dream only that I was wide awake!Positively ear and eye candy for the mind and soul.Don't miss this chance to relive a dream over and over.Roger's music is forever.
B00005RIKD|1.0|I like Sting, but this is awful.  The pacing seems too &quot;artsy&quot; and self indulgent for words.  About the 60th time he repeated the same refrain at the end of I'll Be Watching You (Like he thought I couldn't get enough of it!) I snatched it out of the player and stuck it in my &quot;Sell&quot; pile.

B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney has done it again! This is a fantastic album! Here's my track-by-track review:<BR>    1. I'm a slave 4 U- A lot of people hated this song. I, <BR>however, loved it. Very danceable and has a great beat.5*<BR>    2. Overprotected- Very good. Girls and boys can relate to this song. 5*<BR>    3. Lonley- One of the two best songs on this CD! Very cool mixture of rock and R&amp;B. 5*<BR>    4. I'm not a girl, not yet a woman- The only ballad on this CD! Britney's voice really shines on this one. 5*<BR>    5. Boys- Well, it's okay. NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS. 4*<BR>    6. Anticapating- At first, this song sounds great, but soon gets annoying. 3*<BR>    7. I love rock n' roll- Pretty cool remake, but the chorus plays over and over and over. 4*<BR>    8. Cinderella- The other best song on this CD, besides Lonley. Awesome! 5*<BR>    9. Let me be- Again, the chorus plays continuingly, but the chorus is great! 5*<BR>    10. Bombastic love- This song isn't a good love song, But is great all the same. 5*<BR>    11. That's where you take me- Great love song! The title makes the song sound like a ballad, but it's middle paced. Not one of my favorites though. 4*<BR>    12. What it's like to be me- Good song. Great beat and very danceable. 5* NOTE: Justin Timberlake, Britney's bf, wrote this song. He also does the backround voacles. In my opinion, this song is more like a duet between him and Britney.<br />To sum it up, this album rocks. Go buy it!
B000002J0P|5.0|CSN's debut ushered in the era of true songwriters, and exposed us all to a harmony UNMATCHED to this day.  This record still sends shivers down my spine, as it uncovers so many sides of CSN beyond what the 'So Far' CD tried to capture.  Their non-commercial numbers on this are awesome, intelligent, touching ballads and rockers that only this era could have generated and captured.<br />This debut is a masterpiece of the 'sound of the time', yet it still has a place in today's world.  I was pleased to see CSN on Jay Leno's first show after the Sept. 11 attacks, and what better way to send a message of peace to the world today, just like they did so many years back.  This is the REAL THING, so if you don't have any CSN, get this and 'Deja Vu', and you will be at peace with the world, surrounded by music that captures a generation so precisely - well beyond any 'collection' you could get on TV or your CD club...
B000002MFQ|1.0|Mike Oldfield rapidly followed his ground-breaking debut \\"Tubular Bells\\" with two other equally insightful, and perhaps more mature, works--\\"Hergest Ridge\\" and \\"Ommadawn.\\" While they were not commercial successes on the scale of his first album, neither did they emulate it, which allowed them to stand on their own merits. Unfortunately, after two subsequent decades of hits and misses, \\"Tubular Bells II\\" commits the cardinal sin his follow-up efforts avoided. This carbon copy sounds like an advertising jingle avoiding copyright infringement. It smacks of commercial aspirations, and bombs on artistic merit.
B00000K3D4|2.0|I thought I would like this movie a lot because of the excellent Jim Henson &quot;Dark Crystal&quot; movie that came out before. Like Dark Crystal, the characters were wonderful and better in Labyrinth. Except the bad new is David Bowie ruined the movie. I think Bowie grabbed some old 80's tunes he wrote way back that were so bad they never made it to record. They don't fit into this movie. His acting and music make the film like a horrible music video from the 80's. I couldn't stomach his tunes on this and if the director had any sense he would have cut them all. As far as his acting, anyone in the street would have been as good but he is just fair at best here. I never disliked David Bowie in the past but he damages this movie to make it not worthy to buy and almost not even a rental. They should have picked Sting!
B00004T9AF|5.0|Mike Oldfield's prodigious work of genius is remastered in this 25th Anniversary Edition. The result is a significant justice to the original masterpiece.<br />When the seventeen-year old Oldfield recorded this complex album, it was cut to a heavy vinyl usually reserved for classical recordings in an attempt to preserve the dynamic range of the music. Unfortunately, also preserved were audible electrical clicks from the recording equipment. The technology now available has not only made it possible to erase these but has further enhanced the musical dynamics. Every nuance can now be heard which should delight long-time fans. For those who are new to this album, this remastered version is how it was always meant to sound.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|The movie was absolutely brilliant, and this album does it justice.  I'm a sucker for musicals, particularly musicals with modern day music, and Moulin Rouge was probably the best movie of the summer.  The only reason why I only give this album 4 stars is because it lacks some key songs, &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; comes to mind.  Also, that speech by the Argentinian before &quot;Roxanne&quot; should've been in there as well.  Otherwise, excellent soundtrack!
B00000JR2A|5.0|This has got to be TFF,s best CD ever. I have no idea why this CD did not do so well back when it came out. Everysong on here is amazing. The bittersweet Advice For The Young At Heart made me cry with joy when I first heard it. This album is far jazzier, far different that the Big Chair LP. Go out and buy this CD. In fact get both the Big Chair and the Seeds Of Love albums. You'll be amazed at the musical differences between the two.
B000059XUI|5.0|What can you say this is the best Superhero movie of all time. <BR>Superman 2 is equal in comedy, action, Superaction and romance. <BR>The most freaky and upsetting part of this movie is seeing the twin towers, by the way my love goes out to all you Americans. <br />Only problem with this movie is the fact of being limited extras, there is rumors that a Special Edition is coming out sometime next year hopefully, with a extended version of the film giving a better scoop on the storyline and how Superman got his powers back. <BR>Movie companys usually release a movie on DVD with limited or no extras, then a year or two later re-release the movie with a dozen extras after everyone has bought the movie. <BR>I would wait for afew months or a year or two just to see if a Special Edition is released. <BR>But over all extras or no extras this movie is fantastic, in music, action, romance, Superaction and comedy.
B000003NA4|4.0|There seems to be two vastly different 'camps' of listener's when pertaining to the music of Diana Krall. One, obviously, are fans of her latest two releases, &quot;When I Look In Your Eyes&quot; and &quot; The Look Of Love &quot; two discs that are generally not considered jazz but are perhaps primarily more MOR than earlier, earthier recordings. &quot; When I Look....&quot; is a favorite of mine and I cherish it. And since I subscribe to the &quot; if you can't say anything nice....&quot; wisdom of thought then I won't bother to go into her lastest disc. That being said....I suspect my loyalties for Diana must lean toward her earlier body of work. A body of work, featuring the wonderful Christian McBride on bass, that depended on a much more 'intimate' setting and was much more jazz influenced. That being said....<br />&quot; Love Scenes &quot; is perhaps Diana's swan song toward that wonderful, almost nurtured style of music. Maybe from here on out she'll settle into a mode that is much more homogenized, middle-of-the-road,and ultimately with a broader audience in mind. If that is indeed the case than we should cherish this cd more than ever. Again, as with &quot; Only Trust Your Heart &quot; and &quot; All For You &quot; she relies on piano, bass and guitar format, which actually suits her singing style extremely well. It adds a certain intimacy that I find very appealing and I'm afraid may be lost forever in future discs. Starting off with &quot; All Or Nothing At All &quot; she sets the tone, taking Sinatra's hit and, playing the role of the pleading lover, settting her demands in a playful, almost teasing manner. &quot;Peel Me A Grape&quot;, quite possibly her most 'erotic' song to date, as with &quot; My Love Is &quot; work solely on their ability to be boldly sexual yet tender as well. And as for &quot; I Miss You So &quot; a tune that conveys a more wistful, yearning loss that she's able to project very well. Ending with &quot; Garden In The Rain &quot; a selection where the singer is looking back on a previous love, wondering ( as we all do ) what went wrong. Tender but not a hint of schmaltz...thank goodness. I should perhaps add &quot; Gentle Rain &quot; a song that is warm and simply drips ( no pun intended! ) with atmosphere. Overall &quot;Love Scene's &quot; is a very nice package that shows this artist maturing and growing with each new cd.<br />Overall, whatever road Diana chooses to take in her career is simply up to her ( regardless of all the unsolicited advice she seems to be receiving ). And she will of course have my, if not indispensable, at least full, support! But whatever she decides she won't be able to have it both ways when it comes to the type of artist she ultimately wants to be. Whether she chooses jazz or a more easy listening approach to her music....she in the end must be responsible for that. But choose she will have to do! Unfortunately, it's either 'all or nothing at all'!selection where the singer is looking back on a previous love, wondering ( as we all do ) what went wrong.

B000002JSN|4.0|This album contains the best Zeppelin song, Night Flight. It contains the word night in it. Not only Flying, but night flying. This album is worth Night Flight alone. Only In The Light almost ruins this. Ick, light. Oh Well. NIGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!
B00003CXXJ|1.0|I though comedies were supposed to be funny. The trailers sure looked humorous. Alas, it showed all the good parts; the rest is pretty ho-hum. Disliked the style of animation (it's from the Antz team, another stinker), and the message about people falling in love regardless of physical appearances is totally negated by the ending, when it's discovered that (SPOILER AHEAD) the princess is also an ogre. I realize I'm in the minority here, but this is a VERY overrated film. I'll stick with Monsters, Inc., thank you very much.

Did they us a pansonic keyboard and a drum machine to make this album?I think they also took some clips out of Nintendo's game Zelda for one track, this album is a complete turn around from anything expected from No Doubt. On they're past albums I could relate to their lyrics, now i feel like im listening to Britney Spears and it makes me sick, if you have been a No Doubt fan in the past, I think you would see where I am coming from.  Lets just hope the next album appeals to more than the pop world.

B00005OM4N|3.0|With \\"Britney Spears\\" herself, i do not enjoy or like at all...But that doesnt mean we cant enjoy the music cause its not that bad at all, Britney didnt create it. She only co-wrote a few of them <which i may add was helped by numerous other writers...hmmm><BR>....and it also amazes me how ppl who rate this cd a 1, know so much about Britney and can go so greatly into detail about how much they depise each of her songs....look we all got a few albums stashed at home that some might call \\"guilty pleasures\\"...albums that we buy and listen too secertly. Thats okay. <BR>and as for Britney being a \\"ARTIST\\" she isnt; but who cares? <BR>Since when did music have to imcorporate art anyways? Why doesnt anybody cares about the sounds anymore and this cd has great sound <poor artistic quality> mabye.\\" Stupid lyrics..sadly..yes. but at least the music's GOOD?<br />Im A Slave 4 U The opening track and first single, has a electronic morraccan beat which i havent heard in pop music for quite a while, also sounds nothing like the rest of the cd:) 5/5<br />Overprotected- One of the only songs on here other than \\"Im not A Girl Not Yet A Woman\\" and \\"Thats Where You Take Me\\" which could be considered a radio single. Very fast past and sounds very much like \\"Stronger\\"...so judge for your-self. 4/5<br />Lonely-lots of starts and stops on this on (sounds like Dont Go Knockin On My Door) very annoying song..fast paced but impossible to dance too. 2/5<br />Im Not Girl/Not Yet Woman- Her best \\"slow song\\" and not droopy like her other balleds,i think she was very pround of it considering it was the only song in the cd booklet to include the lyrics:  :  4/5..Britney's voice is the only set back.<br />Boys- Stupid,cute sexy voice with stupid lyrics all pointing to sex and guys. Very embarrassing song to perform, unless your Britney. 2/5<br />Anticipating- Sounds like...disco? (...) but this is actually kinda okay.Very catchy. 4/5<br />I Love Rock and Roll-- Why would you use pop and hip-hop beats if your saying you \\"LOVE ROCK N ROLL\\"? This song does come anywhere near the original. 3/5<br />Cinderalla....yawn FILLAR...didnt excatly finish listening to it.....next 1/5<br />Let Me Be...very catchy but unlistable...sounds chinese?  2/5<br />Bombastic Love- Could have been from the Ooops album. Fast paced w/ a good melody. I like this. 4/5<br />Thats Where You Take Me- Very good job on this song.I love this. Hope it makes it as a single.5/5<br />What it's Like To Be Me-The one Justin wrote. and it shows i has that Dirty Pop sound which doesnt do it for Britney. I really hate this song. 1/5

0688156819|5.0|A friend of mine and I read this book together while holiday shopping at the mall.  What was only supposed to be a quick glance became a cover-to-cover readthrough.  <br />This is by no means a children's book, just so you know...<br />...and it's absolutely fabulous.  Some stories are gross, others gruesome, and most are far beyond what usually passes for imagination.  I laughed and gaped through the progression of stories, cringing when I laughed, and unable to not be amazed and floored with...everything.  <br />This is definitely a conversational piece.
0385505833|5.0|I come from a totally modern dysfunctional family &amp; we are all adults now. I like the Holiday/Christmas season,But not the getting together part and trying to live through the &quot;falseness&quot; of the moods about you. I believe if something does not work, one should change-instead of living the ritual(s). I love this book because of it's relish on possibilities of change. The main character, Luther, is not being mean or acting like a scrooge, but he runs into those who oppose his new &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; wishes for this year. As the book gets more into the theme his wife, Nora,is jumping right on the band wagon to join him - with delight. I won't say anymore; it might give too much of the book away. It's a MUST READ!!It was like reading a breathe of fresh air.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I think this CD is really REALLY good.  I will admit it took me a few times of listening to it to really start liking it, but it is definetly growing on me!  It is very different than any of their other songs, but that is why I love it. It is a fun album and they proove that they can grow artistically and still have great music!  I would reccomend it to No Doubt fans or anyone who just wants some fun music to listen/dance to.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|One word describes this film: Fantastic!<BR>It needs to get Best Picture
0061040967|5.0|This book is utterly brilliant. I think it ranks with the very best of Pratchett's work. As highly regarded as Pratchett's work is, I think he is still dreadfully underrated. A picture book for adults--how audacious--and it works. What about the Leonardo da Vinci notebook takeoff--the delicious detail and amount of work involved! With the wealth of background information that discworld readers will bring to this novel he has written a full-size novel in a unique format and with a sparingness of words reminiscent of Evelyn Waugh and Somerset Maugham. There is an awful lot in the book that isn't in the book per say but in the interaction between discworld readers and their reading of the book. Great Fun and well worth owning to return to again and again and marvel at such inventiveness. Writers of long series should take note--a great ape (no monkeys here) as a major repeat character can be amazingly useful (See &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;.)<br />Favorite Quote &quot;Ankh-Morpork, we have an orangutan...&quot;)Yes! The Librarian also gets my award for best picture. Perfect alchemy of illustrations and text. Bravo Paul Kidby.
B00005QCYC|5.0|I am a huge JURASSIC PARK fan. This box set is excellent. The only thing that disappoints me is that you can only buy this box set in widescreen format, and I do not have a widescreen TV. I am not saying that you cannot watch a widescreen DVD on a regular full frame TV, but it just comes out better if you watch a full frame DVD on a full frame TV and a widescreen DVD on a widescreen TV. So I hope Universal will come out with a full frame edition of this box set. And, you can still get the fourth bonus disc and the fancy, silver engraced box itself even if you have the first and second collector's edition DVDs! All you need to do is go out and buy the JURASSIC PARK III collector's edition DVD (in either widescreen format or full frame), and then there is a form inside the DVD which you need to fill out and send off somewhere to receive the extra bonus DVD and box. And there you have it! Now that I've got all that cleared up, I might as well write plots of all three JURASSIC PARK films. Okay? So here we go.<br />JURASSIC PARK (1993; directed by Steven Speilberg)<BR>Starring: Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Richard Attenborough, Jeff Goldblum, Bob Peck, B.D. Wong, Wayne Knight, Samuel L. Jackson, Ariana Richards, and Joseph Mazzello.<BR>Plot Summary: A wealthy business man, John Hammond (Attenborough), designs a top secret prehistoric theme park on a romote island in the Carribean. He invites a top paleontologist, the paleontologist's girlfriend (who's also a paleontologist), a top mathematician, a lawyer, and his two young grandchildren to explore the park before it opens to the public. Everything is going fine until something unexpected happens and the park's security dies down, letting the dinosaurs break free and it's now up to the humans to find a way to stay alive and get off the island alive.<BR>My Opinion: I loved the original. Speilberg did an awesome job and this is one of his best films ever. The special effects are just spectacular and the sound is incredible. The dinosaurs looked so real. I own the video tape of this film and I must have seen it about a million times already but I still love it and I get a chill down my spine everytime I watch it! *****<br />THE LOST WORLD (1997; directed by Steven Speilberg)<BR>Starring: Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Pete Postlethwaite, Arliss Howard, Richard Attenborough, Vince Vaughn, and Vanessa Lee Chester.<BR>Plot Summary: Hammond still can't keep away from his dinosaur theme park. When he agrees to do some stuff for the public on the island, he has to go back. Dr Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) says that he never wants to go back to the island, but when he finds out that his girlfriend is already on the island, he must go back and get her off the island.<BR>My Opinion: THE LOST WORLD was not as exciting as the first. Maybe that is, because I've only seen it on broadcast TV and I haven't seen it in a very long time. Perhaps if I see it again, I may like it more. But the dinos in San Francisco was funny. I forget much of this one because I haven't seen it in a long time. Still, the special effects are pretty good and the dinos are better than ever. ***<br />JURASSIC PARK III (2001; directed by Joe Johnson)<BR>Starring: Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Tea Leoni, Alassandro Nirvola, Laura Dern (cameo role), and Trevor Morgan.<BR>Plot Summary: Dr Alan Grant (Neill), claims no heaven on earth can get him back to the island of Jurassic Park. But then, a rich couple named the Kirbys (Macy &amp; Leoni) pay Grant a large sum of money to take them across the island for their honeymoon. Grant agrees, but once flying over the island of Isla Serona (the *B* site where the second film took place), the plane crash lands onto the island and their two pilots are eaten by a dino. Then the Kirbys tell Grant that they actually wanted to come here because they are looking for their missing son, Eric (Morgan) who disappeared onto the island weeks ago while para sailing with Amanda Kirby's new boyfriend. Now, they must find Eric and get off the island alive.<BR>My Opinion: I think this was the best of all three! It has a lot more action and gore, and better-looking dinosaurs. The plot is fun and straight-forward. There's more comedy, too. And the action is just awesome and non-stop! The special effects, visual effects, and sound effects are just stunning. The acting is really good, too. This film totally rocked! *****<br />~Hope this review helps!~

B00001ODHJ|4.0|That third Evil Dead episode totally amazed me.<BR>Probably because it went one step further in that<BR>horror/comedy style that is so unique to Sam Raimi.<br />This movie is loaded with fun and gags left and right.<BR>I have never found Ash so funny.  Lots of good ideas<BR>too and quite an impressive output with the limited<BR>means involved at the time.<br />I might reproach that the horror/gore part is a little<BR>too small, compared  to Evil Dead I and II, but it's<BR>still a very enjoyable movie.  <br />I found it quite different than the other two, which<BR>is what I was most surprised by.  <br />The innovative sense of Mister Sam makes this movie<BR>a must have in the genre.  Of course, that might not<BR>be a movie for everyone.  Some people might find it<BR>really stupid.  It depends what frame of mind you <BR>watch it in.  I personally had a lot of fun.

0385505833|4.0|Totally, unlike any other Grisham novel. I just liked this novel vv much. The humor was simple and enjoyable. I found myself laughing outloud several times while reading this short novel.<br />Although the Krank's are mid/upper middle class, the theme is universal (no matter what economic level we all overspend/overexert ourselves and our neighbors each year at XMAS). We shop for gifts, food, decorations, and honor those time-cherised traditions each year--we hang decorations in the bitter cold, travel miles and overspend to find a straight tall tree or rum off to the nearest Home Depot or K Mart for a sparkling artifical tree and drag boxes of ornaments from the attic or basement. But, as Luther found out (isn't some of the trouble worth the effort we all put into this holiday).<br />Frankly, I agree with Luther's idea of skipping XMAS and running off to the Caribbean or a far away place (maybe even a Comfort Inn with a jacuzzi/pool/suite). But what  we do do with family? Personally, I would like to move XMAS someplace else (maybe a winter vacation/a cruise).<br />Am glad he wrote this--been wanting to Skip XMAS for years.<br />This XMAS when I'm out there last minute shopping or decorating I'll remember Luther &amp; Nora and try to find humor, comfort, and solace in my XMAS activites. I might even take a yoga or tai chi class, not tanning, to relax.
B00004U30D|5.0|Ichiro Suzuki of Seattle Mariners entertained us this year, not with the number of homeruns he hit, but with many infield hits, base steals,and shows of his strong arm. No pitchers struck him out often, either. This was a rare treat for a  baseball aficionado like myself. Recent Holywood movies are replete with fantasies or mega-scale spectacles. This movie is a story of the life of a middle-class American family. It is an Ichiro of movie. <BR>It will give a sheer delight for those who appreciate details. God is in the details, as someone said (Michael Crichton's &quot;Disclosure&quot;). I saw this movie several times back to back and still enjoy it from time to time. Direction is good, considerate and tender, and so is camera. Storytelling is excellent (every scene is needed and no scenes are wasteful), and so are dialogues and the character growths. Resolution is extraordinary and compelling. Casting is super. Reading its Shooting Script (the same title, also available from amazon.com) gave me an added delight. No wonder it was given Academy Awards in five categories. Now, this version comes with a bonus footage, which is also entertaining and instructive. This movie is a rare treat for those who love sutleties of human emotions. Yes, I rate this movie five stars, because this is the highest grade that is allowed. ( I seldom give such rave reviews. I do not trust movie critics, either, especially after they put down that excellent movie &quot;Halfmoon Street&quot; (Sigourney Weaver and Michael Cain), which is not even available from amazon.com.)
B000001Y2U|5.0|One of my two favorite albums of all time (the other one being Holy Wood) and I could just listen to it straight through for hours. I don't know what it is about this album but I just love the unique sounds that it has and many find Manson's whiny voice annoying but i just love it and i think he is an extremely artisitic just trying to make his point. Here's a song by song review:<BR>Irresponsible Hate Anthem: I love the chorus to this song and think it just has a lot of great hidden messages in it. I find something knew about each time i hear it.<BR>The Beautiful People: Manson's biggest hit to date and there's no doubt why. It's got the best sound i've heard in a song for a long time and i just love to listen to this song on my headphones.<BR>Dried Up, Tied and Dead to the World: Not one of the best on the album but still a decent, haunting song that you'll find singing in your head while you're at work.<BR>Tourniquet: Extremely haunting piece of art that just creates a lot of creepy mental pictures in your head. (Especially after you see the video. Wow!)<BR>Little Horn: Very catchy and inspired me to write &quot;Litle Horn&quot; on my backpack cuz it sounds like an interesting character.<BR>Cryptorchid: Such a weird sounding song but of course very catchy and the people who've heard it know that it is since the chorus is chanted about six times in the song.<BR>Deformography: I think it's a well-done song that is very underrated considering all the other songs on the album it's up against.<BR>Wormboy: Kinda funny song when you hear the sqeuaky-voiced people repeat the chorus and just sounds really cool.<BR>Mister Superstar: In my opinion, a very well-written song that applies very well about what it's like to be a celebrity in this day and age.<BR>Angel With the Scabbed Wings: This song rocks! Another great one to listen to on headphones cuz it's so loud.<BR>Kinderfeld: Another very strange song that grows on you since it leads the inauguration of the antichrist.<BR>Antichrist Superstar: Ah yes, a concert favorite and creates a very cool sound that creates you want to cheer with the people cheering in the song.<BR>1996: One of my favorites! Very hard and distorted but great lyrics that I love screaming! It's so awesome!<BR>Minute of Decay: I didn't like this song at first but the soothing melody and depressing lyrics grew on me and I enjoy every minute of the decaying.<BR>The Reflecting God: Another great hard one to scream and also another concert fav.<BR>Man That You Fear: Such a sad depressing song that I just love to listen to and the music video is so powerful once you understand what's going on in it.<BR>Hands down, best album ever! A classic for Manson fans.
0553573403|5.0|There is not much I can say about Game of Thrones other than that it was one of the best books I have ever written.  I do not read much Fantasy.  I love Lord of the Rings and the first Six Dragon's Lance.  I enjoyed Wheel of Time up until the 4 book, but gave up on it...too long without an end in site.  With that in mind, again Game of Thrones was an awesome read.  I recommend this book highly, and I can not wait to finish the series
B00000AFGM|4.0|I wanted to give this 5 stars because I really do like this album, but it still feels like nothing when I compare it to Portrait, Antichrist, and Holy Wood cuz they all had this dark and hard metal thing about them that i prefer over this more experimental popish kinda sound. Don't get me wrong, there are still some brilliant songs on this album that I will always love. Here's a song-by-song review:<BR>Great Big White World: A very deep song that is so true about society these days and a good way to start off the album.<BR>The Dope Show: First Manson song i ever heard and it is still so damn catchy that i find myself singing every word to it and I still love it as much as i did when i first heard it.<BR>Mechanical Animals: Decent song that is great to sing to and actually shows that Manson can actually carry a tune more-so than people think.<BR>Rock is Dead: Even if rock is dead, this song still rocks! The instruments are played so well on this song and I just love the sound, it's awesome!<br />Disassociative: Could not stand this song at first, but it's bittersweet harmony kinda grew on me.<BR>The Speed of Pain: One of my favorite songs that i always must listen to when i'm depressed because i can relate to it so much and it just sounds very beautiful to me.<BR>Posthuman: Not one of the best of the album, but it rocks a lot harder than most of the songs on it and i still think it sounds hella great.<BR>I Want to Disappear: Kinda short but still rocks very hard and sounds a lot like the song before it.<BR>I Don't Like the Drugs: Great song with a great sound and brilliant lyrics. The only complaint i have with it is towards the end it gets a little bit long and repetitive that i sometimes end up skipping ahead to the next song once it hits the 4-minute mark.<BR>New Model No. 15: Very catchy and a very subtle chorus that i think is so true and very funny, yet scary, how true it is.<BR>User Friendly: I thought this was a very cool song at first, but after a while youget kinda sick of it cuz the chorus repeats itself over and over...<BR>Fundamentally Loathsome: Ugh, worst song on the album, i don't know what it is about it, but i really can't stand it. Some people like it, but i prefer to skip it.<BR>The Last Day on Earth: People i know think that this song is just morbid and depressing but i find it to be a beautiful love song and it makes me just picturing these two people who are in love holding hands while the world is kinda falling apart from underneath them. It's beautiful.<BR>Coma White: I love this song! The whole song is just so wondefully written and the music video is so affective that i wish people would just watch it before they judge Manson as just being a satanist rocker who wants everyone to die, cuz that's not all true.<BR>Despite that i favor his other albums over this one, it's still a great one that you should own, especially if you like his lighter sound better.
B000002W8O|5.0|My husband is a true Elvis fan and he absolutely loves this CD.  I, on the other hand, just enjoy Xmas music and I really enjoyed this CD as well.  It has all of the best Elvis Xmas songs he ever put out.  If you are an Elvis fan, you will love it!
B00002ND77|5.0|This is an amazing film. I collect DVDs, but only ones that I truly love or have some value. I bought this for me, but I've watched it a few times and cried each time.<br />It starts with the beginning of the life Of Malcolm Little and how he saw the world being a black man. It is both funny, sad and its cinematology is amazing. I love this film and I'm touched every time I see it. The soundtrack is amazing. Jr. Walker's &quot;Shotgun&quot; and many other &quot;R&amp;B&quot; favorites. <br />If anything, the performances of Denzel Washington and Angela Bassett are truly amazing. The story itself will live within our history as one of the great leaders during the 60s.<br />Lori Constien

B00005RFAI|2.0|With Pink's debut CD, she became one of my favorite singers with her ghetto hip-hop R&B style that no other women hardly had. I mean the short ghetto pink-stled hair and just how she moved in performances made one feel like she was a regular homegirl. However, with this horrible b.s. for a second CD, Pink has truly abandoned her roots. I have listened to this CD several times and I still do not like it. I thought that by now the CD would have caught on but negative. This CD is mainly rock which completely confuses me in that Pink goes from hip-hop and R&B to this rockish kind of mode. <BR>With many of these songs, you can hear Pink's soulful and unique voice but the songs themselves are just not worthy enough. AND THEN PINK SITS THERE AND TRIES TO SOUND LIKE NELLY FURTADO OR GWEN STEFANI AND THAT IS A DEFINITE NEGATIVE!! For real, the only ok tracks are Missundaztood, Family Portrait, Misery, Dear Diary, and Don't Let me Get me. All of these except the latter could be on her last CD.<BR>I know that you are trying to expand but this bull sounds HORRIBLE. Don't buy this CD. Get her first one. This is (...).
B00003CXZ1|5.0|this was truly one of the best movies i have ever seen.  angelina jolie does an absolutely incredible job of bringing lara croft to life.  she really makes you feel like the whole thing is really happening.
B00005QDW1|1.0|if you really like no doubt, and what they are REALLY about, don't get this cd. They are not hip hop, they are, or use to be  one of the best &quot;one of a kind&quot; bands out there. now they are leaning tawards mainstream.<BR>don't get this cd, unless you dont like their origonal stuff. <BR>i hope gwen wakes up and sees what she has become. i miss the real No Doubt.
B0000047CX|5.0|For me, the work of Gilberto et. al in the rhythm section is good, but what sets this alblum apart is the inimitable sound of Stan Getz.  His sound always makes me imagine waking gently from a long night's sleep to discover a beautiful nude woman in my room, stretching and yawning in the morning sunlight.<br />There's not much more mellow in this world than that.
B000002R9X|5.0|Gentle Giant is one of the most interesting progressive rock bands that has ever been.  From 1970 to 1980, they put out some of the most provacative, fascinating, and musically complex music in progressive rock.  In the middle of their career, they put out a release calle &quot;Free Hand&quot;.<br />Free Hand: Arguably their most popular album (with the possible exception of &quot;In a Glass House&quot;), and certainly one of their best! It was released in 1972, and is their third recording. The first track, &quot;Just the Same&quot;, starts with the snapping of fingers, making a nice tempo, and it is then accompanied by a keyboard rhythm, and electric guitar, and then explodes into a heavy bass, drums, and vocals: &quot;See me, What I am, What I was, What I'll be....&quot;, as Derek Shulman belts out the lyrics in his inimitable style (and subtlety accompanied by strange saxophones, clarinets, and horns). Changes and more changes, musically, rhythmically, and in time and tempo, abound throughout this catchy, strangely mellow, and at times, heavy, and excellent song.<br />The second track is called &quot;On Reflection&quot;, and is one that continues to display the unexpected virtousity, and inventiveness, and talent of Gentle Giant. It is a song in which all five members of the group sing, in a juxtaposed harmony that is reminiscent of Medieval English minstrel music. Lovely! (Especially Kerry Minnear's soft vocals in the middle of this song).<br />The third track, and title track, is &quot;Free Hand&quot;, and is my favorite song on this recording. This one is really powerful! Back is the driving bass guitar work of Ray Shulman, and the excellent guitar work of Gary Green. Also on this song are all the unexpected changes in tempo, it is like 4 or 5 songs in one!<br />The fourth track is &quot;Time to Kill&quot;, and starts with the sounds from the original computer game, &quot;Pong&quot;. A medium level Giant song, it does groove in it's own way.<br />The fifth track is &quot;His Last Voyage&quot;, and begins with a mellow bass line, compliment by vibes and guitar, and then melding perfectly into a lovely vocal harmony, with Minnear in the lead. This is a very dreamy song, and quite ethereal.<br />The sixth track is entitled &quot;Talybont&quot;, is an instrumental piece, and is another of my favorite songs on this album. Again, it displays that hard-to-put-your-finger-on-quality and medieval feel that much of Gentle Giant's music is famous for.<br />It comes complete with harpsichord, electric guitar and bass, recorder, moog synthesizers, flute, tambourine, and drums.<br />The seventh, and final track on this recording is &quot;Mobile&quot;, and this exhibits the kind of driving, 'rolling' heavy bass lines, raucous vocals of Derek Shulman, and soft keyboard/harpsichord work of Minnear, eclectic electric guitar work of Gary Greene, fantastic drumming of John Weathers. It is also complete and replete with the strangeness and altogether weirdness of Gentle Giant. At times, it is like they are 'punk classical', from Mozart's time, especially when the bass player, Ray Shulman, pulls out his electric violin, and has a go in the middle of the song!<br />So, by all means, stretch the limits of your imagination, and expand your musical horizons with the boundless possibilities of Gentle Giant!rack is &quot;His Last Voyage&quot;, and begins with a mellow bass line, compliment by vibes and guitar, and then melding perfectly into a lovely vocal harmony, with Minnear in the lead.

B00005LOUS|3.0|Well, I never saw it at the theater, the preview certainly didn't inspire me. My wife came back from Blockbuster with it this past weekend and the whole family watched it (DVD). My two kids (6 &amp; 8) enjoyed it and I guess we all enjoyed it overall. I would just say that the gross humor was not needed as usual and the story was dragged out too much. I didn't like the parts where the Grinch came in disguise and wrecked stuff and I didn't like it very much either with his visit for the special celebration. I dunno, they just changed too much and the movie wasn't heppy feeling, it was kinda dark and I actually felt a little depressed afterward, even though the ending seemed happy at the end. The DVD extras are OK, but nothing great, especially the deleted scenes, a waste. So, as my review title states, it's worth renting, but I don't think I'd buy it or watch it again. I do however, own the cartoon and we watch that a number of times each year!
B00005O5JV|5.0|I loved this movie!  It has the original appearance of being another teenie bopper &quot;fluff&quot; movie but ends up showing that petite, blond females have a brain and talent to become more than an ornament on some male chauvinist's arm!  It also illustrates the cultural difference between the &quot;stuffy&quot; east coast and the &quot;open-mindedness&quot; of the west coast.  After raising a petite, blond daughter I know that dynamite does come in small (and blond!) packages!  Good job, Reese!
630575067X|5.0|Well its much the same story as Godfather III , good movie considering hollywood doesnt make any good movies for years now,<BR>but Bad compared to the rest.<br />The effects are excellent, and its more like an experience not tears and drama or interest.<br />this movie is purely philosophical one, if some of the die hard star wars fans didnt get it by now, They must look at the big picture. yes Darth Vader wasnt bad after all, and the Idea is for mankind, that Satan could be in each and every one of us.<br />The movie has very deep messages and call it a 5 year olds ? you all have to watch this movie again and check your heads.<br />peace and love.
B00005OM4N|5.0|\\"Britney,\\" Spears' third album in which 19 year old entertainer fights the system and struggles to expand the musical boundaries of the close-minded pop music scene and emerges successful. Though the lyrical content sometimes seems to contradict itself, the lyrics that many critics question for being contradictory of each other are not actually the lyrics on the album written by Britney. For a more personal portrait of the real Britney Spears, check out the self-portrait \\"Let Me Be.\\" It's Britney's truest statement yet, in which she sings \\"Sorry if I sound confused, or don't feel the way you do, but I won't turn around.\\" She may not be a woman, but she knows what she wants and she's going to get it no matter what. Other highlights of the album are Britney's excellent experiments with the hip hop uber-producers, The Neptunes, such as the fascinating, grinding first single, \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" and the danceable and catchy \\"Boys.\\" Spears shows inspiration from Janet Jackson with the edgy syncopation of \\"Lonely\\" and the disco beats of \\"Anticipating,\\" both co-written by the singer. Britney takes the pop beats of her past to the next level with the powerful \\"Overprotected,\\" the infectious \\"Bombastic Love,\\" and the Spears co-written epic \\"Cinderella.\\" Spears shows her softer side in \\"That's Where You Take Me,\\" with the lyrics of a girl in love with... Justin Timberlake who co-wrote the bombastic \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" with choreographer Wade J. Robson, in which Timberlake adds background vocals that make the song sound more like a duet than anything else. Unfortunately, the couple is now estranged and this collaboration may never have the chance to exist again. Spears' cover of the Joan Jett classic \\"I Love Rock 'N' Roll,\\" sleek and sexy takes the hook of the original to an new level. But the album's highlight is \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,\\" Spears' first truly strong ballad, which she finally has the vocal prowess to interpret in an exciting way (co-written by MaxMartin and Dido). In the spotlight, we have all watched Britney Spears grow from naieve teenager to the twenty year old almost-woman she is today. Some critics blame this album for making a schizophrenic musical statement, but thats half the fun. Spears takes influences from many different musical styles and makes them her own in a fascinating and exciting way. Her vocal strength and power of interpretation carry this album throughout. You can hear that Spears relates to each song well, making this album a deeply personal statement. In a word, this album is \\"Britney,\\" but you already knew that.
0394800184|5.0|This book was an easy reader. Yet it has a very good story line. The little bird falls out of his nest to go find his mommy, he can't find her. The little bird comes across all kinds of different animals / things, that he thinks is his mommy, but they turn out not to be.  In the end the bird is reunited with his mom.  This story makes you sad for the bird in the beginning, but after he finds his mom you feel so happy for the bird. This is a great book!!
B00000IAU3|5.0|I have had this year for over three years, same as my Sarah Mclaughlin CD.  This CD is wonderful and I still listen to it very frequently: in the car, in the shower, doing work, basically whenever I need to hear something soothing and understanding.  Her music is familiar, it's close to a mix between Sarah Mclaughlin and the Cranberries singer.  Her songs are well written and the lyrics meaningful.  Her style is calm and inspirational.  I really like this album because it makes one forget about society and the pressures of life.  They're soft, ambient, flowing, and full of emotion.  Her emotions on this album range from saddness to mockery to yearning and desire.  It's amazing how calm one can get listening to this album. Peronsally my favorite song on this album is &quot;Take My Hand&quot;.  It is reminiscent of familiar partings and reunions, a sort sort of hazy feeling.  This album is great to listen to during bubble baths especially, which has grown into a habit.  I higihly recommend this, it suits many types of lifestyles, though I will say it is aimed towards women especially.
0805053883|5.0|This book has great illustrations! Eric Carle really out does himself with the illustrations. They seem so real. It's almost like you're in the book.  I would recommend this book to any one, old or young! It has been my favorite book for years!
B00003CXTG|1.0|If directors, producers, and screenwriters could be sent to jail for making a bad film then Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Randall Wallace should all be serving life sentences for \\"Peal Harbor.\\"   This is one of the most disgraceful WWII films ever made.  The sheer stupidity of the fictional love story is bad enough, but even a cursory glance at the actual historical events shows how deeply this film has been dumbed-down for (...) audiences addicted to special effects. The CGI effects in \\"Pearl Harbor\\" are intensely obvious, looking like nothing more than animated paintings.  Indeed, most of the combat scenes appear like a softcore rip-off of the battle scenes in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".  Well, nobody ever said Michael Bay's direction ever suffered from a case of originality.
B00001OH7X|4.0|Lodger, the third of the Bowie/Eno trilogy is more reflective of Bowie's style than the more collaborative efforts of Heroes and Low. The sound with its constantly driving percussion and the vagulely African/Middle Eastern rhythms creates a hypnotic feel that captures the listener. But when focus shifts to Bowie's typically distant lyrics, this CD becomes a triumph of style over substance. A little more substance and this could have been one of Bowie's best, as it is it is well worth your time.
0671027344|5.0|This is a deeply moving story about Charlie--a high school freshman struggling to come to terms with himself and his place in the world.  This novel simply sucks the reader into Charlie's world--the sadness, the pain, and yes the exhilaration of &quot;being infinite.&quot;        <BR>The entire story is cleverly presented in letter form with Charlie pouring out his feelings to an unidentified person he simply calls &quot;friend.&quot;  This format succeeds because Charlie's words come across as raw, heartfelt, and sincere--at times beautifully so, at other times, heartbreakingly so.
B00004W5UA|4.0|Fight Club is about a man, known only as the Narrator, (Edward Norton) who hates his boring life and has to find alternative ways to deal with his misery.  One of the ways he copes is by becoming a tourist, but not in a traditional sense.  This kind of tourist is someone who attends support groups even though he/she doesn't have any disease or affliction.  He goes to support group meetings because he likes the coffee, the folded chairs, the crying, the sharing of feelings.  He likes feeling special for once.  The whole premise of this type of &quot;tourism&quot; has black humor value, but the film's handling of these scenes (especially the deadly unfunny topic of cancer) is more dumb than funny or really black for that matter.  <br />While at a support group, he meets Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), another tourist.  She looks like a heroin addict, wears the blackest make up one can wear without looking Goth, and dresses in clothes that were &quot;once owned by the victim of a sex crime.&quot;  Marla hates life like the Narrator, but copes with it by becoming suicidal and self- destructive, unlike the Narrator who becomes violent- a pretty clear statement about male and female aggression.  While women take it out on themselves, men take it out on each other.  But that's pretty much all one can say to describe Marla.  She has no ambition, no motivation, and she doesn't really do anything.  Marla is truly a nothing character, despite Helena Bonham Carter's fascinating performance.  Her purpose is solely to gratuitously have sex and round out the edges of the plot.   <br />After his apartment mysteriously burns down, the Narrator decides to call a soap salesman he met on a plane named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  He finds that Tyler is everything that he wants to be but can't.  Tyler is muscular and good looking in a rugged way as opposed to Edward Norton's sniveling dweeb.  Tyler works at his own pace; the Narrator sees himself as a white-collar slave.  Tyler lives in a dilapidated house, an utter contrast to the Narrator's former IKEA shrine.  Tyler is everything anti-consumerism, anti- greed, anti-conformity.  After their first meeting, Tyler says something to the Narrator thatsurprises him.  &quot;Hit me&quot; he says.  The two then get into a fight, find the experience exhilarating, and start a literal &quot;fight club&quot; in the basement of Tyler's dilapidated house.  Soon, scores of men across the unnamed city they live in start showing up to beat each other up.<br />The basic message I got from this film is that when men feel they aren't allowed to work out their aggressions, they become violent and insane.  The target in this film is consumerism and conformity in the work place, which threaten a man's masculinity.  Consumerism, according to Tyler, is the artificial hunter-gatherer sense of worth, and thus picks apart the biological foundation which gives worth to the male mind.  To compensate for this confusion and subsequent loss of masculinity, these men need to beat each other up and get beaten up to feel the rugged pain that they've been denied their lives.<br />A question I found myself repeatedly asking was, could someone actually &quot;enjoy&quot; breaking their nose, punching their teeth out, and getting stitches?  The purpose is to show the EXTREMES of male frustration, but it would have been better had David Fincher had actually made the violence glamorous.  As it stands, the violence is graphic enough to be unwatchable, but also too unrealistic to take seriously (no one can kick and punch someone in the jaw repeatedly without breaking it in some way).  Or maybe, just maybe, Fincher didn't have to show the violence at all.  How brilliant would a movie with the main theme of violence be if it didn't have a lot of actual violence in it?  Also if violence and mayhem is a common goal among men, how come most war veterans find themselves in trauma and shock at the evils of their own violence?  And why don't these menenroll in<br />the army if they enjoy pointless violence so much?  Though any movie that generates heavy discussion, is, by default, interesting, most of the questions Fight Club conjures are provoked about the basis of why the movie was made to explore these themes, not about the actual content itself.  Thus it doesn't constitute as sufficient ambiguity. <br />Finally, the twist ending.  Although surprising and cool, not that much of interest happens before then.  However, the twist is so cool in fact, that I was almost tempted to forget how much I didn't enjoy the movie up to that point.  Consider it a great ending to a sorely misguided movie.
B00003CY5J|1.0|Wow What a cast amazing actors old and new in this very bland and predictable movie about a big robbery(hence the score).<BR>Nothing that great to offer in the story department(seen it all before), but worth watching for performances by Edward Norton Robert De niro, and of course a very annoying and hard to understand Marlon Brando.<BR>This movie starts off very slow and continues on that track till the some what exciting end(although everyone knows or should know what is coming at the end.) <BR>So I  say this is just another average movie with an average story but staring a great cast.<BR>Rent it but please do not buy (unless you are having trouble sleeping...<BR>hammy
B00005NI5Y|2.0|..and melodies that are pretty weak. A few old 3-chord blues patterns,the same gravelly voice, and the background arrangements all seem too much one and the same. Some of the lyrics are interesting,but that's as it should be. &quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;PoBoy&quot; may be the only two that rise above mainly average songs from country/folk/rock tradition...But at the age of 60, at least Bob and the gang are still trying. This album shows the generally dismal new sounds aging rockers can produce, and it sounds embarrassing when you consider that they're still basically producing material for people now nearly two generations behind them, and with all the disparity of life experience that suggests.
B00005QDW1|2.0|I'm going to have to agree with the reviewer that pointed out the MTV and TRL influences. That can be the only explanation for this disappointing album. <br />I had originally hoped that the atrocious first single &quot;Hey Baby&quot; was not indicative of the quality of the album. The album as a whole is only a little better than the single. I'm not a music critic at all but this album is missing a lot of the emotion and dare I say maturity of Return to Saturn. Instead, the lazy lyrics and music writing are a giant step backwards to initiate a new generation of Gwenabies that don't expect too much from their music. <br />I really hope Gwen doesn't turn into one of those people that still dresses like a teenager when she is 40.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Bringing a video game character to the big screen was seemingly a difficult task. Any time it was attempted in the past it didn't look too hot. But Jolie became Lara Croft and was phenomenal. From the fighting style to the wardrobe to the music - I loved this one.

B00005JKES|1.0|As previous reviews have noted, the pilot is missing from this DVD set.  However, I disagree with other commentators who have called it &quot;curious&quot; and &quot;an oversight.&quot;  It is neither.  It is an obvious ploy whereby in one or two years a &quot;SUPER Special Platinum Premium Edition&quot; will be released.  It will include the pilot.  You will then have to buy the &quot;new&quot; set and spend another $50.  <br />Then again, I could be wrong.<br />In any case, I'm a sucker and will still buy this set on the off chance that the extra DVD material has managed to add to the list of synonyms for &quot;creepy&quot; and &quot;mysterious&quot; that abound in Twin Peaks commentaries.
B000000H57|5.0|It's true! (...) That's how powerful this album is! All the songs are amazing (even the kind of annoying stuff like \\"Bad Ground and the end of \\"Red Water\\"). The songwriting displays a seldom seen talent for creating moods and atmospheres within the songs. To be honest, I'm quite a sucker for more violent music, like Meshuggah or Slayer, but no other album has affected me quite like this one.<BR>BUY IT! (trust me, it's a lifesaver)<BR>Peace
B000002H6C|5.0|It's truly hard to believe that this brilliant piece of metal artistry was made by the same band that released the &quot;black&quot; album, Load and ReLoad.  I mean, it's so perfectly written and performed that it may be possible that the reason they sold out is because they couldn't do any better than this.<br />This release is the first to have Jason Newsted on bass guitar replacing the mighty Cliff Burton (RIP).  While he had a good sound, he didn't do much more than match what James was doing on guitar.  This was due to the fact that the songs were pretty much written, but Jason didn't really know what Cliff was up to.  Still, it ended up being a classic thrasher. While this CD contains some slower tunes (that still have that heavy shred), it also contains some of the bands fastest songs to date.  So fast, in fact, that they don't ever play them live because Lars bit off a little more than he could chew when he actually recorded it.  What a weenie.  Anyway, this release would be the last of a great legacy of thrash metal.  They were the kings.  Were...<br />This is how I like to remember them.  Not as revolutionary as &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; and not as ground breaking as &quot;Kill em All and Ride the Lightning&quot;, but still an example of what metal used to be when money wasn't the ONLY thing on ones mind.  Regardless of who they turned out to be, this is a classic CD that needs to be in your collection.

B000000H6D|5.0|Now, the difference between this release of Bloody Kisses and the original release of BK (ASIN: B000000H6Y) is that they cut out all the punky/speed metal type tunes and added one really long and beautiful song about the horror of being a vampire.  If you're more on the &quot;gothy&quot; side and you have no patience for fast rock, then I recommend getting this release.  However, I have to say I like the original better as it is more balanced and emotional.  But, it's still an excellent album and one of my faves!!  On to what I think of both releases:<br />I was really suprised when I first heard this album WAY back when. I knew Type-O from &quot;Slow, Deep and Hard&quot; which I didn't like at all. Then one day I heard &quot;Black No. 1&quot; on the radio one day and I thought &quot;This is brilliant&quot;. A song that makes so much fun of the whole goth culture, yet perfectly captured the dark, autumny, vampiric feel of the whole goth music scene. And they do it very well. When I found out it was Type-O I suddenly had a new found respect for a group of guys that had a fairly wide range of styles (if you call rock, punk and goth varied) and ALSO had the ability to execute all of them perfectly.<br />Peter Steele's voice is very unique and really gives a creepy feel to all the songs whether they be fast, slow or really slow. Reminds me a lot of The Swans. In fact it wouldn't suprise me AT ALL if The Swans were a major influence on the switch of styling that they've undertaken with this release. This is a great (debut?) into what would be a serious of very dark and emotional, yet funny and wild, CD's that really stand tall as a Tribute Of Excellence (a Headstone, maybe) for when Type-O are no more.<br />Once more, if you are at all into &quot;dark, slow and heavy&quot; music then you won't like any of Type-O's earlier releases. They're good, but they're nothing like Bloody Kisses, October Rust and World Coming Down.
0345413377|4.0|That this series is beautifully written and vibrantly conceived, I cannot deny. I was so enthralled with this last volume that I couldn't put it down -- despite being at a noisy party, I read for two hours until I finished. Pullman's worlds are complex, his philosophy sophisticated, and his characters endearing.<br />That being said, I felt this volume lacked the tight writing of the previous two. I was disappointed with the fruition of the prophecy from the earlier works -- despite the build-up, Lyra's &quot;temptation&quot; is one common to all people. Worse, however, Pullman's critique of the church became positively knee-jerk in parts, undermining his credibility. Church members seemed to have little motivation for their cruel and brutal actions; they became flat, two-dimensional villains, not people. One priest/assassin character got almost no narrative time except to A) stalk the protagonists and B) think about convincing the peaceful wheeled people that their very way of life is Satanic. Pullman may have been trying to demonstrate that the life-denying quality of the church pervades it, but that particular comment seemed unmotivated and contrived -- essentially a pot-shot.<br />Overall, I am very sympathetic to Pullman's brand of spirituality, but I feel he undermines his cause somewhat by demonizing religion in such a categorical way. Liberal religious people today are engaged in taking back religious language from fundamentalists. Many use the word &quot;God&quot; to describe that immanent spirit of life that Pullman portrays as being opposed to the church. By setting up worlds in which &quot;God&quot; can only be the patriarchal, hierarchical head of a spiritual hegemony, Pullman makes the task of those committed to making religion meaningful again even harder than it already is.<br />As a work of fiction, there's not much to fault in this series. But I do think it's a shame that the chip Pullman has on his shoulder with regards to Christianity leads him to alienate some of the religious people who would otherwise be his natural allies.o alienate some of the religious people who would otherwise be his natural allies.
B00005B36H|1.0|This album bores me to death.  No kind of excitement or catchy riffs, nothing.  It reminds me of some kind of Hindu meditation music.  I'll stick with Slayer, In Flames, and Slipknot.
B00005OB0A|5.0|finally, here is the song called, 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head' which was played all night long at Madonna's party and which is currently her most favourite song...that's how i got this album and listen to...the most refreshing and cool british dance and pop music i've ever listened to in a while. My favorite is In Your Eyes.
0887306101|5.0|I first read this book in 1991 and I was so pumped up that I read it again a year later.  The tales of these professionals kept me riveted and the relaxed, conversational style of the book makes it an easy read.  I learned several of my most hard-and-fast disciplines from this book (&quot;cut your losses, let your winners run&quot;, &quot;know your 'uncle' point&quot;, &quot;have patience to wait for the right trade to come along&quot;).  Favorite interviews were Michael Marcus, Paul Tudor Jones, Ed Seykota, Larry Hite, William O'Neil and Jim Rogers.  Surprisingly, what you gather from the compilation of interviews is that despite a focus on different investment time horizons or securities, there are common keys to success across most of these guys, many of whom achieved legendary status.  I came away from this book realizing that you must take these well-established rules and apply them in a disciplined fashion to your personal investment style.  You will not be good at all things (stocks, options, commodities, shorting, etc.).  So, find what your personal strength is and apply these disciplines to achieve success.  I still make investing mistakes (believe me!).  But I've made a lot fewer of them because of the lessons I learned from this book.  Three other points:<br />1)  This book turned me on to Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, my all-time favorite book about the markets (check it out in Amazon).<BR>2)  The book is a bit dated, so some of the people (e.g., Robert Prechter) and newsletters (e.g., Zweig Letter) referenced by the interviewees are no longer around or have lost status.<BR>3)  The New Market Wizards falls short of the standard set by this book, but the sequel is still probably worth reading.
0553106635|5.0|I've read some of the reviews that others have written and it seems to me they keep saying the same thing: GRRM doesn't mind killing off main characters. I say this is wrong. The characters he kills off aren't the main characters, just supporting ones. The real focus of these stories is the Wall and the impending doom from the Others, everything else is just window dressing. I think it's brilliant, however, that GRRM can weave the story so that you forget all about the Others--just like the characters in the story--and concentrate on the Game of Thrones happening in the south. The characters he kills off--while enagaging and very interesting in themselves--would never play a part in the battles with the Others, which is why it doesn't hinder the story to kill them off...the fact that he makes you love these otherwise minor characters, and care what happens to them just shows what a great developer of characters he is. It's all so subtle, so sneaky, and oh so brilliant.

6304341849|5.0|Regarding the movie itself:  I really can't add anything new which hasn't already been said about &quot;Maurice&quot; -- and I LOVE the movie!<br />One thing to note:  the soundtrack for this movie is absolutely gorgeous.  The score transcends being &quot;movie music&quot; and can stand alone on its own right as a concert piece.  Very seldom have I ever encountered a musical score which so very nearly matched the mood of the movie -- the ones which come to mind are &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, Bernard Herrmann's scores for Alfred Hitchcock, and the movie &quot;Cinema Paradiso.&quot;<br />I'm music director for a church, and have used parts of the score as prelude and postlude music on Sunday mornings -- and the congregation loved it!<br />This is a first-class movie with a top-notch musical score!  (John Williams, take notice:  one CAN write an effective musical score without trying to out-orchestrate Richard Strauss!)
B00003CXXJ|3.0|I probably would have given this 4 stars on its merit, but I was severly disappointed by Dreamwork's animation here.  Here they totally missed the mark--even a computer animated cartoon should be a cartoon.  Lord Farquar for example is maddenly realistic and yet not at all realistic.<br />Look at Snow white's innocense and the simplicity of its animation.  Take Pinocchio and the water scenes that you believe because they're not too real.  Dreamworks tries too hard to make things look real and limits your imagination.  <br />There were great comical moments, but they have done much better story-lines in the past.  It's definately a worthwhile movie and I don't regret buying it, but it will never be a top ten for me.
B000059T5O|4.0|The reviews herein lead me to believe that the Waits fans don't know much about Hammond and vice versa and the two groups have entirely different takes on this collection. The Hammond fans seem to think it's good blues while the Waits fans aren't too sure what's going on here.<BR>I fall into the latter group. I've listened to Waits since 1975 and have watched his stylistic evolution while marveling that the more he changes the more he remains the same.  The acerbically romantic worldview pervades the Asylum albums, the Frank's Wild Years musings, and the &quot;post-Frank&quot; material that seems to synthesize much of what has gone before.<BR>All this background makes me wonder if Waits isn't putting us on here and laughing at what the public will accept. I basically like this album, but I can't help picturing Wayne Newton in the vocal spotlight, with Waits and his back-alley band churning up the underworld behind the curtain.  The covers of a wide range of Waits' music sound like Waits arrangements, but with a lounge lizard vocalist. Even darker musings like &quot;Jockey Full of Bourbon&quot; and &quot;Buzz Fledderjohn&quot; come across with something like a Bossa Nova flair. The tune that seems to best fit this soft-rock formula is the first one, &quot;2:19,&quot; which I don't recall hearing anywhere else.<BR>A lot of performers in diverse genres have successfully interpreted Waits' music, but they usually overdramatize it compared with the often spare original. Check out Paul Young's overwrought &quot;Soldier's Things&quot; or Rod Stewart's lush &quot;Downtown Train&quot; and compare them to the originals. By contrast, on this album drama seems to take a back seat to understanding the lyrics.<BR>So, I wonder what's going on here, but I expect that's the point. Waits' music seems to stand up to almost any treatment, so if you like Waits (or Hammond) buy &quot;Wicked Grin&quot; and listen to it a lot. You'll probably wonder too, but it's worth it.
B00003CY5J|2.0|This movie reminded me (because of the way it was wrapped up) of \\"Boiler Room,\\" that movie that contained less than 10 minutes of really good acting (Ben Affleck's cameos), with an OK script, but a lousy ending! Same here... When it was over my wife and I looked at each other like \\"What on earth happened here? Is that all?\\" The plot, pretty basic: De Niro is Nick: he steals expensive jewels and collectibles for a living and is faced with a very large coup, his last one, where he's joined by Edward Norton (Jack). It's SO predictable that Jack is going to try to set Nick up, that I don't mind saying it here! Plus, Marlon Brando's part is more than secondary: in fact, you could almost do away with it altogether... Don't know: the more I think about the movie, the less stars I feel like giving it. At least I didn't pay [money] for two movie tickets!
6304082428|5.0|I watched this adaptation when it was on TV several years ago and was absolutely enchanted. I bought the video as soon as I could and I haven't stopped watching it since.<BR>Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth do a wonderful job as Elizabeth and Darcy and the supporting roles are well cast and brilliantly acted.

B00003CX6P|5.0|THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY is one of those rare films that make you truly appreciate the fine art that moviemaking can be. By now, you who are reading this already know the basic story: Set in the 1950's, a young drifter from New York by the name of Tom Ripley (played to subtle but intense perfection by the talented Matt Damon) befriends, and insinuates himself into the lives of, rich spoiled Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) and his girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) in coastal Italy after being sent there by Dickie's rich industrialist father. Mr. Greenleaf merely wants his slacker son to come back to New York and take a managerial position in his company, but Tom has different plans which gradually become more and more revealed during the first half of the film. Dickie doesn't want to come back to the States, anyway; he's having far too much fun with his new friend Tom, who introduced himself as someone Dickie knew while at Princeton University. While Dickie never fully believed this story, Tom somehow intrigues him with his many abilities, such as with languages, and his quiet and irrespressible charm. The main benefit Tom provides Dickie with is male companionship, which becomes a source of shame to the promiscuously bisexual Dickie, who cheats on his would-be fiance` with members of both sexes. In the meantime, the fully homosexual Tom develops an obsessive crush on Dickie.  When Dickie begins to rebuff him, Tom learns quickly how to use his friend's philanderous ways to his own advantage. How he does this you may already know by now, but what makes THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY so engrossing is not merely the events that play out, but how each character's flaws play off of each other, and how the situation gradually snowballs to a conclusion that is as unavoidable as it is unpalatable.<br />The events of this story also involve intriguing supporting characters that are played by the always-uniquely-cast Philip Seymour Hoffman (who has built up his film career with impressive supporting roles in successful films such as TWISTER and BOOGIE NIGHTS to FLAWLESS, ALMOST FAMOUS, and now this film) and the always-appealing Cate Blanchett (as radiant here as she was in ELIZABETH). They help round out the flavor of the film as well as helping to create some of the more pivotal moments in it.<br />This film is an intensive period character study that presents a time and a place where urges were joyfully pursued but always hidden, and were never, ever discussed in public. Plus, the film's breathtaking scenes, which were shot on location in places like coastal Genoa, the ruins of ancient Rome, and the canals of Venice, provide a perfect backdrop for these characters and their decadent, not-quite-liberated lifestyles.<br />Anthony Minghella, who wrote and directed this movie, adapted Patricia Highsmith's novel far more successfully than he did THE ENGLISH PATIENT, which I found to be quite ponderous in certain areas. Although it didn't win nearly as many Oscars, THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY never gives you the feeling that it's straying off its central plot. However, you never feel like you know exactly what's going to come next during any given scene.  This movie is so well constructed that you just HAVE to stay with it to find out how it all turns out. When you do, you are rewarded with a conclusion that is both disturbing and real, and certainly does not feel contrived by any means. If only 'true stories' presented on film had as much of a mastery and understanding of human emotions; then we'd have more films that are as transfixing as this one is!<br />Definite recommendation to buy.

B00003CX9E|5.0|I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and indeed, all is vanity and grasping for the wind. Ecclesiastes 1:14 <br />I have put off reviewing Citizen Kane for quite some time, as it seems to be so oft praised that it is almost impossible to be objective about it. Everybody knows something about Citizen Kane - even folks who have never seen it know that it is a classic, perhaps the classic - the best film ever made. How do you go about describing the Holy Grail of cinema without sounding like the usual sycophantic hack, grinding out his two cents worth of pulp on a movie that has already had more written about it than any other? <br />It would probably help to remember that in 1941 the power of the newspapers was much greater than is evident today with television, cable, the Internet, and all the alternative means of communication we have at our fingertips. In those days, the newspaper was it - the only other major information source was the newsreels that accompanied Saturday movies - newsreels like the one that is used early in Citizen Kane to give a brief sketch of the deceased's life. Newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane was dead and the questions on everybody's lips were, &quot;Who was Kane?&quot; &quot;Why was Kane?&quot; and &quot;What did he mean by 'Rosebud' (his dying word)?&quot; If you watch the movie looking for answers to these questions, you are bound to come away dissatisfied as it answers them incompletely or not at all. <br />Rather than recount the story which is so well known, or elaborate on the innovative techniques used in filming Citizen Kane, I thought it would be interesting to find out why Welles chose newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst as the model for the fictional Kane. What would be Welles' motivation to attack a public figure who had done him no wrong? Not only that, but why would he attack somebody with the power of the press at his beck and call, someone who could (and likely would) strike back. My research along those lines only revealed tantalizing snippets of information, not enough to satisfy my curiosity. Still, it has been well documented that Welles was a guy who liked controversy and William Randolph Hearst was a juicy target. Perhaps Citizen Kane is a great film because it is enigmatic, it doesn't give any easy answers. Therefore, my inquiry bore little fruit... <br />Kane is the story of a man who gained everything, but at the cost of being deprived of his mother's love and companionship. An early scene shows him being separated from his mother and sent back east to live with a banker after his mother comes into a considerable fortune. From there, it shows the rise of a newspaper publisher and fall of a man who wound up dying friendless and alone in his palatial mansion &quot;Xanadu.&quot; What happened? When asked, Welles himself could not explain how Kane's dying word came to the knowledge of the reporter. However despite that little mystery, the movie has quite a bit of appeal. <br />Kane's story is told via flashbacks (No, Quentin Tarantino did not invent them!) from five different points of view. A faceless newspaper reporter asks Kane's closest associates to tell their recollections of him. The reporter's questions provide the springboard for each of the flashbacks. <br />Camera work and lighting by Gregg Toland used a technique called 'deep focus.' This, unlike conventional focus, allowed both foreground and background to be in razor-sharp focus at the same time allowing the viewer to decide which part of the scene to fasten his attention on. Lights and darks are used to depict the moods, light when happy, dark when depressed. Unusual camera angles abound and a number of scenes are long takes without editing. Voices, like in many of Welles' films, are often dubbed, allowing Welles to stage shots and insert and overlap dialog similar to actual human conversation. Great film editing by Robert Wise offered many dissolves, montages, and startling effects notoften seen before. These and other techniques used in Citizen Kane are textbook examples used to demonstrate good film making today. <br />The final scene of Kane shows Xanadu's basement, a vast landscape of possessions, the remains of Kane's mortal existence. Workers are classifying it, stacking it, and loading the junk into a furnace. By this time the alert viewer knows the 'book answer' to the reporter's question, &quot;What is Rosebud,&quot; however, while the film offers this obvious meaning, according to some reports it was William Randolph Hearst's pet term for his mistress' most private part. The camera pulls back and shows the smoke (the remembrance of Kane) from the furnace billowing from the castle's chimney. <br />While nominated for nine academy awards, Kane won only for Best Screenplay, a collaboration between Herman Mankiewicz and Welles. Kane was the high water mark of Welles' success as a director. Due to backlash from Hearst and his powerful friends Welles was never allowed the luxury of such creative control again. <br />What does it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul? <br />Citizen Kane should be required viewing by anybody interested in film. It shows the results of a prodigal life with many material benefits yet yielding very little spiritual fruit.

B00005QZ7U|2.0|Maybe I just didn't get it, but I lost interest after the first 5 minutes.  The pan-in/pan-out technique was more irritating than anything else, I had no sympathy for any of the characters and could care less if they tried to bring the sound of music to 1890's Paris.  <br />Badly produced, excellent acting, maddening cinematography and a poor excuse for 2 hours of my time.<br />Kidmann can find better uses for her talent than this.
B000002IM7|4.0|This is the first King's X album I bought, and I must say it's a pretty impressive piece of music!  King's X have got the Rush/Queensryche style going on, with the heavy riffs, melodic hooks, and great musicianship to boot.  They have both cruchy prog-rock burners and melody-drenched ballads.  All of the playing here would definitley appeal to musicians.  In other words, these three guys are a tight progressive rock band.<br />The lyrics are often based in spirituality, usually Christian based, but are never &quot;preachy,&quot; and can appeal to those of different faiths.  Other songs are based on love and human relationships, which can also appeal to many.  With all these strengths, I'm not quite sure why they've never been big.  Oh, well.  I suggest that you give this album a try, and then try &quot;Gretchen Goes to Nebraska&quot; and &quot;Ear Candy.&quot;
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink's latest creation is definitely NOT a disappointment, in fact I'd say it is *better* than anything else she's put out there.  There's a burning truth in each of the songs... Pink seems to be exposing a side of herself she didn't or couldn't show on her last album, and this is definitely admirable.  For those pondering a purchase of this CD, I definitely encourage you to buy it... you won't regret it! :)
B00005ALP6|5.0|&quot;My Fair Lady&quot; is the legendary director George Cukor's crowning achievement.   Every element of this movie works, from its sumptuous photography by veteran cameraman Harry Stradling, to the glorious costumes and sets created by Cecil Beaton.  The music is incomparable.  Frederick Loewe's melodies are lovely and infectious and Alan Jay Lerner's lyrics are every bit as witty and touching as the dialogue originally written by playwright George Bernard Shaw for &quot;Pygmalion&quot;.  &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; is the musical version of &quot;Pygmalion&quot;.<br />The transformation of the illiterate, unwashed Eliza Doolittle into the breathtaking &quot;Fair Lady&quot; of the film's title is inspiring to see.  This is one of Audrey Hepburn's best roles, and she is perfection as Eliza Doolittle.  She is thoroughly convincing as the Cockney flower girl who transcends her humble roots to end up dancing with a prince at an embassy ball. Hepburn expertly translates Eliza's tenacity, vulnerbility, intelligence, and grace into a beautiful and timeless performance.<br />Yes, it's true that Julie Andrews (who created the original Eliza on Broadway) was bypassed for this role.  However, this was purely a business decision made by studio head Jack Warner.  He did not want to risk such a lavish, expensive production on a relative newcomer such as Andrews was at the time.  So he went with the safe bet, Hepburn, as Eliza Doolittle.  Audrey was an established star with a great track record.<br />But Andrews soon recovered from this disappointment to make two blockbusters of her own, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and &quot;Sound of Music&quot;.  Not a bad trade-off I'd say.<br />Anyway, I enthusiastically recommend that you buy &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; on DVD or VHS.  It is one of the best musicals ever written for stage or screen.  You'll see what I mean.

0385505833|2.0|This short novel started out extremely slow.  It was difficult to get into but I plugged along anyway knowing Grisham would give me a great ending.

0380796090|4.0|This is my favorite of the three Marian Keyes novels I've read.<br />  Keyes' humor is a little dark, but quirky and uncompromising.  She's great at describing real life frustrations. Her heroines are always strong and have a warped sense of humor.  I love the introduction to Claire's family.  Helen is hilarious, and even though she may make a better secondary character, I hope she gets a book of her own.  Every character in Claire's family is wonderfully drawn.<br />However, I could not understand why Claire's husband, James, had an affair and acted as he did.  I didn't feel like I understood his character or motivations at all.  At least if he's going to act like a jerk, have the reason be fairly credible.<br />I am seeing a trend where Marian Keyes' stories follow the same basic storyline.  Fairly attractive heroine involved in crisis, must rebuild her life or meet challenge.  Her life and the people in it no longer look the same.  Everpresent male friend/boyfriend eventually steps forward for relationship.  Heroine renews life.<br />This story is a pageturner, but still in the Marian Keyes way-- predictable.  And I don't always appreciate Keyes' humor, which is sometimes too wry for me.<br />If you like this storyline check out the 1986 movie Heartburn with Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson.<br />Autobiographical novel is by Nora Ephron, who was briefly married to and had two sons with Washington Post journalist Carl Bernstein of Watergate fame.  Deftly directed by Mike Nichols.  Kevin Spacey can also be spotted in his first feature film role.
B000059T5O|4.0|John Hammond gives Tom Waits' songs his own blues joint flavor.  If you like Tom Waits, you're gonna dig this.  Waits plays and sings on a good part of it, so it's really a Tom Waits / John Hammond collaboration.  Recording quality is outstanding. Bottom line?  This is a fantastic CD.
0385505833|3.0|The book had a great beginning and good characterization.  The middle of the book when the plot developed kept me interested.  The end was disappointing, however, and seemed to negate the whole point of the story.  I wish they had continued as planned.  Also, the whole marriage thing surprised me as well, and I didn't like that either.  Grisham had a good idea at the beginning, but his twist of plot at the end made the book a disappointment.
B000002JSR|3.0|Since its release in 1982, Coda, a collection of outtakes from Led Zeppelin's legendary career, has been slammed by critics and fans alike who felt the work was sub par for the seminal British hard rock band. It is true that there are few songs on Coda that live-up to the standards set by Zeppelin's eight albums, which probably explains why they are outtakes.<br />Listeners have been unfair to Coda by judging it by the standards of other Led Zeppelin albums. It was not meant to have the impact of those releases. Coda was compiled strictly for Zeppelin's diehard fans; to save them the from attempting to accumulate the band's entire body of work through expensive bootlegs. Although, it is certainly weaker than most of Led Zeppelin's albums, as a one of many serious Zeppelin acolytes, I appreciate the gaps filled by Coda.<br />Side A presents some excellent tracks from 1969 and 70, back when Led Zeppelin were young, boisterous bluesrockers. \\"Poor Tom\\" is a hypnotically melodic, jangley footstomper; \\"We're Gonna Groove\\" exemplifies the enthralling, scrambling guitar style of early Jimmy Page and the energetic cover of Willie Dixon's \\"I Can't Quit You Babe,\\" recorded during a 1970 rehearsal, surpasses the version of the tune on their self-entitled debut.<br />The second side does not fair as well. It features lumbering hard rock songs recorded for Led Zeppelin's final album, 1979's In Through the Out Door, that were abandoned when the band decided to adopt a synthesizer-infused sound for the album. Some of the songs indicate why they felt a change in style was necessary. \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" and \\"Darlene\\" are like many songs on 1977's Presence, in that they are not necessarily poor songs, but they show enough sloppiness and predictability to indicate that the band could not blaze through a rollicking tune as masterfully as they use to. \\"Bonzo's Montreaux,\\" a \\"Moby Dick\\"-ish, extended drum solo that was recorded for Presence, also falls flat.<br />The only noteworthy track on the second side is \\"Ozone Babe,\\" an exceptional, hook-slinging rocker that features the entire band in full action. Leadsinger, Robert Plant's flirtatious choruses bounce off the band's crunching, relentless riff rocking with considerable grace, energy and charm. It is one of the best songs of the band's latter years and, if not for Coda, it would have been lost because of the band's change in style for their final album. Songs like \\"Ozone Babe\\" explain why diehard fans treasure-hunt through artists' unreleased material and also why Led Zeppelin has so many diehard fans.
B00005Q66T|5.0|This is a great album to have, or buy someone for the holidays. It's also perfect for those haters that didn't keep up in the 90's. This will turn out to be a wonder pop catalog album. I highly recommend it. Madonna's Drowned World Tour is a awesome as well.
B00005QDW1|3.0|Don't buy this album with the expectation of hearing the gushing angst filled &quot;who am I?&quot; lyrics of the previous albums.  It reminds me of reggae with a Debbie Harry kind of groove thrown in.  While I'm not crazy about the album now, I'm sure that with time it will grow on me like Return of Saturn.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Baby boomers who have lovingly collected all of the Beatles original albums on cd will have little real need for &quot;Beatles One,&quot; but the fact that this includes, in chronological order, at least one side of each of the Beatles' records that reached number one on the singles charts makes it fun to listen to and an attractive &quot;extra&quot; for any Beatles collection.<br />People complain that the cd does not necessarily include the Beatles' &quot;best&quot; songs.  Hey, it's not claiming to do so, and besides, the group produced so few &quot;clinkers&quot; that any &quot;best of the Beatles&quot; selection would necessarily have to span multiple cd's. Critics also point out that some of the most excellent b sides to the Beatles' many two-sided hits have been excluded.  It's definitely a shame that &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; (the other side of &quot;Penny Lane&quot;), &quot;I am the Walrus&quot; (the flip side of &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;), &quot;Rain&quot; (the b side of &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;), and &quot;Please, Please Me&quot; (the other side of &quot;From Me To You&quot;) are not included.  But consider that as it stands, this cd is over 79 minutes long and hence presses up against the limits to what a cd disc can possibly hold (eighty minutes or so).  Whereas some of these exlusionary choices might have been based upon a flip of a coin, the compilers of this cd probably axed &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; and &quot;Walrus&quot; simply because they are relatively lengthy pieces as top forty fare goes.  <br />The one complaint raised in some reviews that I think is valid relates to the bizarre stereo mastering done on a few of the tracks, most notably &quot;Daytripper&quot; and &quot;We Can Work it Out.&quot;  Pushing the lead vocal way over to one channel and relegating the entire instrumental accompaniment to the other side is a horrible and unnatural way to present any song.  If remastering was not possible, then perhaps the monauralversions of these songs would have been preferable.  <br />There are certainly other changes I wish could have been made.  Personally, I have always hated &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko,&quot; and I can't stand those horridly syrupy strings that Phil Spector added to Paul's lovely &quot;The Long and Winding Road.&quot;  There is an unadorned version of the song included in the final Beatles &quot;Anthology,&quot; and I would have loved to see it included here.  But then again, the whole point of the cd is that it includes the actual &quot;top forty&quot; versions of these songs, and that means sorry, no substitutions.<br />Overall, I love this cd, as it spans nearly the entirely of the Beatles' *oeuvre* in a single cd that delivers hit after hit after hit after hit. . . As a &quot;first Beatle album&quot; for someone born too late to hear this amazing group the first time around, this is a fine choice, indeed.
1563896656|4.0|The most lighthearted tale even written by acclaimed comicbook scribe, Alan Moore, is likely the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Moore borrows characters from famous works in Victorian Literature, including Mina Murray, Captain Nemo, the Invisible Man, Alan Quartermain, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, and places them in a Justice League-type team, gathered together to find a stolen device capable of unleashing the horrors of aerial warfare on London. Moore constructs a dead-on parody of these high-flying romantic heroes; their stuffy attitudes and language; their utter political incorrectness; their obvious sexual hang-ups. Fans of Moore's darker work, such as Watchmen and From Hell, may be disappointed, but those of us who have read the rousing tails of adventure it masterfully parodies will find the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen entertaining and hilarious.
0393317552|2.0|Jared Diamond explains the differences between human societies but under-emphasizes an important factor. Randomness. Randomness in genes and natural events. I find it extremely difficult to believe that as human groups spread out across the globe they all had exactly the same IQ, physical abilities, etc. It is more likely that they were different from the start. Diamond tries to paint a picture where these differences were nonexistent. I've been in enough school classes where we dividided into groups to do the same project. At the end of the semester the diversity of the end results was amazing even though the groups were supposed to be identical in IQ, ability, etc.<br />It is highly likely that certain cultures ARE better than others. Their group gestalt was superior even in early times. Perhaps they gravitated to a particualry good leader. Perhaps they had a better notion of decision making, or curiosity, or whatever. Unfortunatley Diamond tries too hard not to offend with this probable truth.
B00005QDW1|3.0|First off I want you all to know I do not own this CD so you don't have to take my review too seriously, but I have heard most the songs(Here Goes). I love No Doubt and I own most of thier other CD's . This has some very good songs but some of the elecronic songs are not that good, I like a lot of electonic music too but I dont think that No Doubt can pull it off. Rock Steady is sort of like  theSmashing Pumpkins album Adore in the sense that the band made a drastic style change and half hated it and half liked it(I liked it). Just no one say I'm not a true No Doubt fan because I am.
B00005JHCP|5.0|Though I agree with the person who said that this movie is another example of the 'dumbing down the people', I suppose that reviewer has never actually READ 'David Copperfield.' While it is an intriguing book, it's hard to get into if you don't pay strict attention. It's definitely for advanced readers. Major parts are cut out of the movie, like his stay at his aunt's lawyer's house and some other things, but its not to dumb anyone down, its to prevent the movie from being five hours long. Remember, in England, kids Daniel's age can't work for very long. Its much easier and cheaper to make a short movie that hits the important parts than a long movie that pulls in every little detail.<br />I hit upon this remake one night and fell in love with it. I didn't realize until about 45 minutes into it that the kid who plays young David is actually Daniel Radcliffe. In my own opinion, I think he actually does better in this movie than in the Potter movie. He holds his own against the seasoned actors around him, and shines through in the first part. Unfortunately, I was unable to catch the second part, and therefor am unable to review it. I'm sure that it is as great as the first. I'd like to buy the tapes, but if anyone would like to sell me their copy, I'd be GREATLY interested. My e-mail is musesofstarz@yahoo.com. Thank you.
B000002I2G|3.0|The Soft Parade is often unjustly criticized for being the most dreadfully commercial of the Doors' albums, largely by those who can not get over the album's first two tracks. I will admit, those songs are a lot to forgive. Backed by a mushy horn section, \\"Tell All the People\\" and \\"Touch Me\\" were everything the Doors thankfully were not. The songs were syrupy, banal, creatively sterile lounge-act imitations, invented only to please their record company's insistent request for more commercial material.<br />But simply writing off the Soft Parade because of those terribly misaimed attempts is to disregard twenty seven excellent minutes of the Doors' shadowy, blend of rock, blues and jazz. The remainder of the Soft Parade features several excellent examples of Doors trademarks such as earthy mysticism (\\"Wishful Sinful\\"), frothy blues-rollicking (\\"Wild Child\\") and smoky, spiraling jazziness (\\"Shaman's Blues,\\"). It also embraces more authentic adventurousness on tracks such as \\"Easy Ride\\" and \\"Runnin' Blue,\\" the band's first foray into country boogie and album's highlight, the title track, a cryptic, mood-shifting epic that condemns suburban, mid/upper-class cultural assimilation. The song features a fully charged Jim Morrison sounding simultaneously scathing and graceful. Although every song after track two is at least good, this is the only truly legendary moment of the album and a epic that surpasses \\"When the Music's Over\\" and even \\"The End.\\" When Morrison entices listeners with his authoritative, even frightening, chant of \\"You cannot petition the Lord with prayer!\\" the album's embarrassing opening pair of songs is quickly forgiven.
0385505833|1.0|While the premise was great, I ended up putting the book down in disgust. I genuinely enjoyed the concept, two people vetoing the commercialism, opting instead to enjoy a holiday vacation. Great idea right? Wrong. I found that the characters suffered from a lack of spine. Why would anyone hide behind curtains and doors to escape from carolers? Escaping to the basement to avoid yet another round of neighbors persons trying to get donations, when a simple no would suffice. The final straw for me was when Carol, the main characters wife, forgoes all her plans to appease a daughter who is quickly flying back to the states after a month. Discussing this among my friends we agreed unanimously that we would have told the daughter to enjoy her stay in the house, we are going on a cruise. Sorry Mr. Grisham. I've enjoyed many of your books, and will continue to look for your titles, but can't in good faith put this on my shelf. I will be skipping this title for Christmas.
0385484518|5.0|Don't borrow this book from a friend, or check it out at the library, BUY it for yourself.  A truly moving and inspirational story that every person should have in their collection.  Mr. Morrie Schwartz, provides, what one should think is common sense values for living, but lessons, somehow we all forget to live by until it's too late.  You couldn't have made up a better story.  My new favorite book!! I want to carry it around with me always!<br />The book's under 200 pages and can be read in one sitting.  Get the book, sit down, and read.  You won't regret it.

Yes, this book is good.  he is trying to get you to change your thinking about money and life.  Could he be trying to pull a fast one, i doubt it.  If you're in college, ignore my typos and don't quit yet.  A child prodigy once taught me that the purpose of school was to teach you to finish something.  Will school provide you life long dream for financial independence?  Doubtful, but if you look towards God, and this is not alla or any other god but the one true god and use his financial advice then you will be a success.  Parts and pieces are true.  one example he uses in further books are the examples of firefighters who work and use their spare time to do some of the things that he is recommended.  All this means is don't quit your job and try to do what he is recommending.  A slow go approach would be more appropriate.  So it may take you twenty, thirty, forty years to be financially independent, what's the hurry, there are no u-hauls in heaven.  If you put the Lord's kingdom first, then all these things will be added unto you.  This does not mean you will be rich beyond imagination, not until heaven of course, but you won't be begging bread either.  I've been homeless, poor and made it out with Godly help and no other way.  Don't let the book get you down, it is not the end all be all.
0380817683|5.0|With all of the Bridget Jones copycats out there, I'd have to say that Marian Keyes's novels are among the best of the imitators. They are funny, intelligent, and in this particular novel, actually raise some decent issues. I was excited that &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; continues the story of &quot;Watermelon&quot; but with a different Walsh sister. I liked the Walsh family when I read &quot;Watermelon&quot;, and &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; doesn't disappoint. My one complaint is that while the first 2/3 of the novel is written in excrucitaing detail, Keyes whips through Rachel's last month in rehab and the next year and a half, which was a little disappointing. However, it was a great story and you'll keep rooting for Rachel and Luke until the last pages.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I admit I am not the biggest Star Wars fan, but this movie did put me to sleep. I just found the acting and the storyline horrible.<br />What is even worse is that the DVD is so uneven in its video quality, that I found myself constantly checking my DVD player to make sure there was nothing wrong with it. Argh!<br />The video presentation on this DVD could have been SO MUCH better.
0800141660|5.0|All novels have to be abridged for their movie debut. Those adapting for screenplay must carefully consider scences that can be condensed or eliminated to allow the film to conclude in two hours. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is no exception. It has been beautifully and skillfully adapted for film. The spirit and beauty of Jane Austen's novel remains intact.
B00005LOUS|4.0|I thought that Ron Howard's vision and version of the cartoon, &quot;The Grinch&quot; was wonderful.  The art of the backrounds were pretty close to the caroon and the costumes were excellent.  This film is great for all ages because it's pretty clean, language and situation wise.  People tended to give this film a low rating becuase they are too critical.  It's just a movie!  I recommend this film to anybody.  The narration by Anthony Hopkins adds some warmth to it.
0385505833|5.0|I have read all of Grisham's novels -- even before he was famous.  I saw a different dimension of this author when I read A PAINTED HOUSE.  SKIPPING CHRISTMAS is another novel that doesn't seem to have been written by Grisham.<br />First, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS is hilarious.  I caught myself laughing aloud.  I didn't think Grisham had much of a sense of humor, but this book shows it.  Second, the characters are vividly written.  The reader will witness quick but coherent character development.  The characters seem too real.  I am willing to bet Grisham based the personalities on people he has known.<br />This is a charming short story.  In hundred years, people will continue to read it and laugh.  It surely will become a Christmas Classic!
0060920084|2.0|I was so disappointed.  I have read other Bill Bryson books and loved them.  This one is terribly boring.  It just goes over boring stereo-types of different regions of the U.S.  I had to struggle to finish it.  I kept hoping it would get more interesting, but it never does.  However, Down Under (In a Sunburned Country) is hysterical, and has tons of interesting facts.
B00003CXTF|1.0|I actually really looked forward to seeing this film but WOW, there is no other way of describing this film as anything but a horrible mess. Call it the 'Titanic syndrome' but taking a major historical tragedy and slapping a love story on top of it just came out a mess in this case. Bad casting, worse acting, horrible history, and THE worst script of a major hollywood film all in one. The video game-like presentation of the attack simply did an injustice to history and all those who fought and lost their lives.
6302038308|5.0|Let me just say that Bruce Campbell is a pretty darn good actor for a B rated movie.  He takes his work seriously.  This movie is darn fun!  The situations are hilarious!  Laughing animals, a hand that takes over and other wierd and off-the-wall situations make this film funny and fun to watch.  It's stupid fun, but that is the best fun, right?  The gore is still there, but most of it is pretty mediocre.  If you are looking for a horror film to laugh at and want a good time, I recommend this one!
B00000J2SO|4.0|As in 1973, Ritchie was placed in a difficult quandary in 1979 to replace a singer who had epitomized the sound and style of his group. Although Rainbow never quite achieved the comparable global fame as Deep Purple, Dio's commanding presence had been every bit as integral to the band's image as Gillan's. Fortunately, in a successful repetition of six years earlier, Ritchie found an excellent singer in Graham Bonnet whose powerful voice befitted Rainbow just as effectively as Gillan's replacement David Coverdale suited Deep Purple. Unfortunately, while a capable album, Down to Earth does not attain the earlier heights of Burn. Whereas the latter signified a landmark progression in Purple's songwriting in heralding the increasingly mystical and Middle-Eastern dimension to Ritchie's music which culminated in an artistic zenith with Rainbow Rising, Bonnet's debut is a regression from Rainbow's prior albums. Nevertheless, what faults Down to Earth suffers are hardly a consequence of Bonnet himself; admittedly, the main reason this album scores four stars is especially due to his impassioned performance. Rather, the criticisms lie with Ritchie's choice to commercialize the music; a decision which, although only moderately damaging here, would eventually prove to be fatal. Thus, what results is an unusual, transitional Rainbow album mostly featuring pop metal while still retaining notable elements of the gothic Dio past. <BR> As the lavish expenses incurred in transporting the enormous computerized rainbow were undoubtedly a catalyst in inducing Ritichie to shift the music to a more mainstream direction, it entreats purists to speculate that had he jettisoned this cumbersome prop altogether, would the subsequent Rainbow albums have been written in the supernatural atmosphere of the Dio era? That in concert Ritchie still continued to perform many Dio tracks during the short lived Bonnet era invites puzzlement over his choice to change musical direction for the studio whilepleasing the fans with the old classics live. In any event, in listening to Down to Earth one cannot help but view it as a compromised album. Although the opening track &quot;All Night Long&quot; has a classic majestic riff reminiscent of &quot;Man on the Silver Mountain,&quot; the ensuing verse immediately indicates that Ritchie has eschewed his prior mysticism for pop sensibility. This marked shift is underscored in another uninspired track, &quot;Born to Lose&quot; which recalls lesser Deep Purple numbers on Who Do you Think we Are (not coincidental, as Roger Glover rejoined Ritchie after six years to become his Rainbow co-songwriter as with Purple) While &quot;Since You've Been Gone,&quot; has an infectiously catchy riff, it becomes increasingly tedious after a while, in sharp contrast to earlier sophisticated classics like &quot;Stargazer&quot; which retain their potency after numerous listenings.One can only imagine how bored Graham must be in still having to perform it at every single concert!  <BR> Allegedly one of the salient reasons why Graham was sacked shortly after this album's release pertained to his indolence in contributing lyrics; in retrospect, this is a pity for with MSG, Alcatrazz, and Impellitteri, Graham not only disciplined himself but proved to be an insightful lyricist tackling supernatural tales &quot;Desert Song,&quot; &quot;Kree Nakoorie&quot; and &quot;Leviathan;&quot; poignant recollections of childhood &quot;Starrcarr Lane;&quot; alcoholism in &quot;Too Drunk to Live, Too Drunk to Die,&quot; and &quot;Secret Lover;&quot; and finally incisive political commentary &quot;Hiroshima Mon Amour&quot; and &quot;White and Perfect.&quot; In any event, Graham's lyrics unquestionably would have been superior to Glover's prosaic offerings, which, apart from the critical exception of &quot;Eyes of the World,&quot; relate exclusively to love affairs. While Dio's lyrics peridocally offered incomplete stories with unfortunate verse repetitions, theywere a significant component to Rainbow's halcyon years in inspiring Ritchie to take his songwriting to unprecedented heights; their colorful atmosphere doubtlessly influenced him to craft songs which reflected their mythological content. In line with Ritchie's disposition to commercialization, Glover's tepid lyrics sadly  reinforced his songs to be competent but safe and unadventurous. With Dio, Rainbow was poised to take metal to a higher plane by carving its own niche of medieval flavored epic rock; after his departure, Ritchie's motives became far less ambitious in providing straightforward, entertaining rock. Indeed, this album's title suggests a more modest approach to songwriting in contrast to the previous Dio epics. <BR> With the negatives being said, it is time to dwell on the positives which ultimately outweigh them. &quot;Love's No Friend of Mine&quot; is an effective blues song, reminiscent of Mistreated, albeit on a smaller scale, and Lost in Hollywood features an ambitious neo-baroque interlude recalling Ritchie's still present but steadily declining classical affinity.  <BR>Nevertheless, the two finest songs on the album, &quot;Eyes of the World&quot; and &quot;Making Love,&quot; affirm that some vestiges of Rainbow's glorious past still lingered in Ritchie's songs. This is nowhere more apparent than on the former, an epic track which, apart from its lyrical content, easily have been penned during the Dio years. Powered by a signature Blackmore riff, it culminates in a slithering Middle-Eastern guitar interlude which stands as one of Ritchie's greatest solos. Glover's lyric likewise weaves a provocative political analysis, a stark and refreshing contrast to the otherwise tepid love themes which dominate virtually every other song. Don Airey is an exceptional keyboardist, but like the equally dextrous Tony Carey, he is underused with his role largely ancillary apart from a few brief shining solos in &quot;Eyes of the World&quot; and &quot;Lost in Hollywood.&quot; The album is enhanced by Glover's production which is overall sharper and cleaner than that of the Dio era; here the bass is  clearly audible and Ritchie's solos lash over the rhythm with more clarity. <BR> Nevertheless, the album's greatest asset is indisputably Graham Bonnet. Unlike future collaborations withYngwie and Impellitteri, Ritchie's songs better complement his style and grant his voice more space; here Graham gives what is perhaps his finest performance on vinyl, singing in a comfortable middle vocal range devoid of the high pitched screams which clearly strains his voice on subsequent albums. All in all, Down to Earth is a rewarding album showcasing Rainbow at a critical juncture in its career.
6304953747|5.0|I've watched the movies from this trilogy at least over a million times. This is a stand out horror film. Plot(?) is simple 4 college students in an isolated cabin by the woods (how cliche)play a tape recording that invokes an evil spirit and possesses them 1 by 1. Ash who is without a doubt the coolest super hero in the history of horror films is the last one remaining to battle the demon spawn. Cheesy gore effects and plenty of buckets o' blood , bad acting , bad dialouge , and if you saw this movie before all the new rereleases it was a terrible watch due to bad sound and picture (but that really helped out it's horror appeal). Camp classic horror
B00003CXXP|5.0|Well, I want to thank all the people who work with this movie. Actullay it is from the best movies I ever saw. The Actors were really good and they put the Movie Good Shape especially that we miss like this story which have Action, Drama, and Passion in it. I want also to thanks the Director Mr. Steven. Well, I want to say to him Excellent Job and I wish you all the Best in your Job. My recommendation is to see the Movie and feel the Passion inside it. Thanks
B00005QW4K|5.0|This is the third and final(?) installment in the Evil Dead series. It picks up where Evil Dead II leaves off. Ash is transported to the 14th Century where a war is going on , and he gains control over the kingdom with his chainsaw hand and &quot;boomstick&quot;. In jokes from classic horror films , especially the hillarious Klatu , Verada , Nicto (from The Day The Earth Stood Still ) and Jason and The Agronauts inspired skeletons. Hillarious one liners (&quot;Hail To The King Baby&quot;) and careless slapstick humor , acrobatic action , it's just great. Own it
B00000IPAX|5.0|A while back I wrote a review of this CD. However, my tastes have changed DRAMATICALLY since then. Plus, I called it punk several times in that review. This isn't punk. But it sure as (***) isn't pop either. This is pop/punk. Punk is like Pennywise, NOFX, Bad Religion, Pulley ect. Not that pop/punk doesn't kick (***) also, cause it certainly does. This is not the best CD ever like I said before. It is however the 3rd best CD, the second best pop/punk CD, and the best Blink182 CD. Here is a track by track listing of the Enema of The State:<br />1. Dumpweed: Hands down the best song on the CD. It is hard and fast. And reminds me of EXACTLY the reason that I love pop/punk. This song is a brilliant pop/punk masterpiece.<br />2. Don't leave me: Another pop/punk masterpiece. It is the second best song on the CD. In fact it sounds kind of like the previous song. Except in this one the focus more on speed and drums, and less on the guitar detail. This is Mark's favourite. He says he wrote it but he has no clue what it's about!<br />3. Aliens Exist: Here the greatness of the CD calms down a bit. However it is still an awesome song. With great lyrics for any Si-Fi fan. A solid song by Enema standards. A great song by music standards.<br />4. Going away to College: This is the only song on the CD where the acoustic guitar is noticeably present. Well, actually it's not an acoustic guitar. It's an electrical set to sound like an acoustic one. However, this is only in parts of the song. I like this melodic song a lot.<br />5. What's my Age again: I used to LOVE this song. However, I don't really anymore. It i still a decent song. However, it just isn't punky enough. However, I wouldn't say it is poppy either. It is more like some other weird kind of alternative. Definitely not a pop/punk song.<br />6. Dysentery Gary: If you are an easily offended girl, then skip this track cause it can be offensive to girls. But if you aren't then jam on to another great song by Blink182.<br />7.Adam's Song: Another *shudder* radio hit. Doesn't even sound like blink. This is still probably a pop/punk song unlike What's My age again. However, it is much slower. The guitar music is more simple, and cluttered a little during the chorus. I still like it but it should not be a hit.<br />8. All the Small Things: Definitely the popiest song on the CD. It is a fun song. I like it. However again, the radio is (***) for choosing this as a hit.<br />9. The Party Song: Now we are back to the KICK (***) blink songs. This is a VERY FAST song. IT's just insanity. even though it is one of the shortest songs on the CD, it has the longest lyrics! A great song.<br />10. Mutt : This is the worst song on the CD (after the hits) and yet still is a good song! It is much slower, mellower and lighter than other Enema of The State Songs. In fact it sounds very similar to something that would have appeared on the Cheshire Cat CD. Only it is more polished, and SLIGHTLY poppy.<br />11. Wendy Clear: This song was probably written around the making of Dude Ranch because this song sounds like it could have easily come off of the Dude Ranch CD. Dude Ranch BTW is the 2nd best Blink182 CD.<br />12. Anthem: This song is definitely the hardest Blink182 song off of any Blink182 CD. It is the 3rd best song on the CD. You can just hear the background music overflowing with rich electrical guitar music. A great way to close the CD.
6302038308|5.0|This is the second installment into the Evil Dead trilogy. This is not a sequel but really a slapstick Three Stooges inspired remake of the first film. The first film was a grainy horror movie with unintentional humor. This film is the most hillarious piece of work i've seen in forever. I saw this movie for the first time when it was released when I was 8 years old and couldnt stop laughing at it's cornball cheescore humor. The &quot;plot&quot; returns Ash to the cabin with his girlfriend , plays the tape that invokes the spirits , his girlfriend becomes a monster , he hacks her head off only to find her naked corpse dancing the ballet.The first half of the film is nothing more than Ash taking a severe beating from his severed possessed hand and going on the brink of insanity. Then a couple related to the people who occupied the cabin before show up only to find out they became demons. Then a hick couple tags along. Yeah thats basically the plot right there. The rest of the movie is each person becoming possessed or eaten by a demon. We get gallons of blood , eye ball eating , walking severed hands , green gore , cheesy animated demons , giant trees , and of course Ash .&quot;groovy&quot;
B00005MP58|5.0|My girlfriend begged me to,watch P&amp;P for months. I tried to put this off as long as possible, figuring it was a typical period piece for the ladies. One night, with nothing else to dio, I finally gave in. After the first episode was over... I demanded she stay up for at least the second episode. And then I insisted we finish the whole series the following day. I guess I liked it. It was charming all around.
0385505833|5.0|&quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; was one of the best books of fiction I've read.  When a middle-aged couple decides to 'skip Christmas', the fun just begins.  The reading is light, quick and to the brim with humor.  A perfect gift for someone who likes a good, cozy read.  A perfect treat for yourself.  Definitely a book to share.  Destined to become a classic, I wouldn't be surprised to see it as a tv special in the future.  Pure delight.
B00005JKES|5.0|Twin Peaks- finally!! A definite must for all!!  Contrary to popular idea- the TP Pilot IS on dvd!! Check out the web! I do advise watching the pilot first- or you WILL be lost automatically. Now the bad news- season 2 isnt out yet! :-(  Hopefully soon!  Enjoy

B00005RFQ5|1.0|In the 80's, Prince was a pioneer among pioneer's before him, reinventing pop culture &amp; setting a new standard 4 every artist during &amp; after our generation. Through the years, amidst line-up, musical &amp; even name changes, I've been able 2 conjure up enough spirit 2 gleefully call &amp; praise him the best pop artist of our century, offering us more than The King or The King Of Pop could ever muster up. <br />But, I guess in his own words of the song 'Sometimes It Snows In April'....'all good things they say never last'. This album is a jumble of a confused Prince, celebrating his newfound religion as a Jehovah's Witness (that means no more 'Darling Nikki' lyrics kiddies!) which he always tapped into spirituality, but he's gone way overboard. The jazzy, Mingus/Thelonius Monk stylings of the music will leave u feeling less like you're partying at the Glam Slam but more like you're suffocating in a smoke filled dive with a room full of beatniks.<br />There are tiny outbreaks of our beloved Purple One crawling out at times, but not enough 2 keep this fanatic who's stuck by &amp; at times even stuck up 4 him when naysayers said 'he was over'. Give me the Black Album or even the White Album (Lovesexy) anyday.<br />Do yourself a favor &amp; listen 2 this 1 b4 buying it...a lack of sales may finally be a wake-up call that we want the real Royalty Of Pop &amp; Rock 2 reclaim his crown!
B00003CXZ4|1.0|I have tried to watch this movie 2 or 3 times and can't get past the forst thirty minutes, makes no sense to me or my wife and friends, I guess I will try to watch it again.
B000003TAW|5.0|This is a supoib album lyrically and musically. It starts off with the quirky My Name Is Jonas, easily sing-a-longable and catchy. No One Else is not the most profound song, but stays tight and perfectly produced, in addition to Cuomo's great voice. The World Has Turned And Left Me Here features a great bass line and lyrics that almost anyone can relate too and one time or another. Buddy Holly is, no matter what anyone says, an awesome song. Everything here is perfect, and even the little nuances are perfect-- the hand claps, the background vocals, etc. The Sweater Song is the angriest peice on the album, but still hummable and funny in a dark way. Surf Wax America is angry too, but in a more &quot;subtle&quot; way-- Rivers sarcastically complaining about the rat race disguised as an innocent surfing song. Say It Ain't So is one of the best tracks, the chorus is just killer. It took a while for me to like In The Garage-- it's a sweet song but the tune is rather repetitive. Now we come to Holiday, probably my favourite song on the album. It's got such a great tune, and the words are fun to sing along with. It ends up with Only In Dreams, one of the most loved songs of all that =w= has released. It drags on a little but it is pretty, in a dark way. <br />In closing, this is an album that I would recommend to nearly anyone. In my opinion, it's just as good as the legendary &quot;Pinkerton&quot;. Not as serious, but has a good beat and you can sing to it.
B00005221L|4.0|PREDATOR: 5/5<br />     Dutch (Swarzenegger) and his group of elite recon soldiers are hired to rescue two POW's who were captured amidst guerilla warfare. As they complete the mission, however, they discover that the base they were sent to infiltrate was a central guerilla base, and that their real purpose was to stop a major operation before it reacher the border into U.N. territory. Appalled at the dishonesty towards him and his men, Dutch takes his team and prepares to pull out. Little do they know that an otherworldly Predator is roaming the jungles, hunting any formidable foe - one by one - for sport, removing their skulls as trophies for the kill. Now Dutch and his men are on a race against time to get to the rescue 'chopper at the extraction point - but a stand against this Predator must be made now - or there will be nobody left to be rescued.<br />THE DVD: 2/5<BR>   Predator is among the group of films such as Aliens which set the trend in filmography, sound, and design for the 90's.<br />  Picture Quality: 4.5/5<BR>      Considering how old this movie is, the quality of the film is excellent - though if you inspect the film enough, you'll notice some parts with the telltale 80's film grain. Also, as with almost all other DVD's, the picture is harshly faded to to limited colors of the average television set - for best look on ANY DVD film, it's good to have a high-definition TV, or view it on your computer.<br />   Sound: 5/5<BR>       Wow! MAJOR improvement from the junk delivered to us in the VHS version. Crisp and clear, with only a few sound glitches which aren't the DVD's fault but the film's (again, stereotypical 80's stuff).<br />   Special Features: -10/5<BR>       Yes, that's a &quot;-10&quot;. I can't believe FOX could slack off on special features this much. One of the main reasons people buy DVD's is for the interest in special features - and all we get is a teaser trailer.<br />OVERALL:<BR>Terrible in the special features market, but the movieitself and the great improvement in the film's quality make up, somewhat, for it. Buy this DVD if you simply don't have the movie and want it - but if you're like me, and have it already on VHS, buying this DVD isn't worth it, unless you're absolutely obsessed in the idea of having the movie in widescreen.
B00005A46T|4.0|There are 2 kinds of metalheads out there. Those who like slipknot, and those who hate thier guts.There is no in-between. I happen to like them alot and this only reaffirmed my worship for this awesome group of iowa hicks in prison uniforms.However, if you didnt like slipknot before, this will not make you a fan. Iowa is brutally hard and unrelenting, so no casual fans or \\"wait and bleed\\" posers need apply. I personally like tracks 2-11,and 13-14 (i don't like skin ticket for those who didnt get that). If you like the band already or can handle the hard stuff, this album is for that select few. (...).Slipknot when platinum becase of their sound, wich is awesome (long live joey!). Thanks for the time.

B000002TYX|5.0|THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY is the greatest retrospective overview of any group I have seen. In early 1994, the three remaining Beatles, Paul, George and Ringo, were give a cassette tape of demos made by their late bandmate John Lennon (who had died in 1980) that he had made in his home circa 1977. The three Beatles, nicknamed the \\"Threetles,\\" added overdubs onto the original recording to create a \\"new\\" Beatles recording, the first since 1970. They completed two of Lennon's uncompleted songs, \\"Free as a Bird,\\" and \\"Real Love.\\" The first was issued on this first Anthology album, the latter on the second album. These two new tracks are the backbone to the whole Anthology set. Besides the three albums, there are the two singles, FREE AS A BIRD and REAL LOVE, which each contain the title tracks, as well as three others; the Anthology book, over 300 pages, and the Anthology documentary, just recently released on DVD, with over 11 hours of footage.<BR>A warning to new fans: These Anthology albums do not have the original masters of The Beatles' songs that you would hear on the radio and may be searching for. These are outtakes, jam sessions, and live recordings of familiar favorites, as well as previously unreleased tracks. The first volume covers their early days, circa 1958, through late 1964. Volume two covers 1965 through early 1968. The final album covers 1968 through to the end, mid-1970. These albums are a great insight to the way the Beatles evolved and changed as musicians and are well worth the money, especially for the rare new songs.
B000002MG1|5.0|if there is one album that sums up r.e.m.'s career, this is it. poetic, moody, and profound, there is not a bad song on it. although some consider &quot;ignoreland&quot; the rotten apple that spoils the bunch.. it is more tongue-in-cheek. this was the album that really won people over into seeing r.e.m. as a band with pop power (&quot;shiny happy people&quot;) and true songwriting capability. this album is classic r.e.m., in the truest sense, particularly &quot;find the river&quot; and &quot;everybody hurts.&quot;
B000002UYZ|2.0|Nearly every song The Beatles recorded is great, so why waste your time trying to pick out a few as the greatest hits? This (and the accompanying Blue album) are the only Beatles \\"greatest hits\\" albums, besides THE BEATLES 1, which is strictly No. 1 singles, rather than the debatable \\"best of...\\" While it is a good compilation, it still seems pointless to try to pick out the best of the Beatles.
B00000ADG2|5.0|both poignant and dignified, lauryn hill is one of the forerunners in modern neo-soul and hip hop.. she won more grammys before she was 22 than most people ever dream of winning.. and its not without reason. this album really did it for me, particularly the song &quot;to zion.&quot; a great, must-own album that embraces elements of reggae, hip hop, and soul.
B00000IQW0|5.0|The quality of the picture is great, the sound is OK, but then it was never originally intended to be Sci-Fi material.<br />The biggest problemn I have is that while claiming that the DVD is in \\"widescreen format\\", suggesting that they have preserved the entire image that would have been seen on a movie theater screen, they did nothing of the sort. Instead, all they did was lop off some of the bottom and the top of the screen, SUBTRACTING from the original image, resulting an a FAKE \\"widescreen\\" format. Therefore, you're actually getting LESS of the original image than if it were done in the normal full frame format. This is verified by comparing the DVD scenes with the normal video tape of the same film. <br />We can all argue whether or not we like the Widescreen format or not, but the idea of presenting a film in \\"widescreen\\" is to PRESERVE the entire image that was shot with a high aspect ratio, not remove some of the image from a film that was shot with the normal ratio!!!

B000002UVX|5.0|Sometimes God graces us with individuals who are blessed with extraordinary talent. Jimi Hendrix was one of those people and this CD is a display of that extraordinary talent.    The first two songs , WHO KNOWS and MACHINE GUN , are from the first January 1, 1970 show while the rest is from the second show of that day. You can see the actual performances of both songs on the DVD \\"BAND OF GYPSYS : LIVE AT THE FILLMORE EAST\\" (although on WHO KNOWS they cut out Buddy Miles' scatting in the DVD)    You might as well call MACHINE GUN a classic. Everyone just loves this version of the song. Some people own this CD just to have this one version. Miles' vocals supplements perfectly into this song and Billy Cox gives an excellent steady bass groove. Hendrix's guitar solo on this is one of the greatest ever.    I also love the ending to WE GOTTA LIVE TOGETHER. The song here is greatly edited down from its original time. The unedited version is on the 2 disc cd's \\"LIVE AT THE FILLMORE EAST\\" As the pace began to build it was almost like Hendrix and Miles were having a race for the end of the song.     As time passes , sometimes , those who we once considered great suddenly become obsolete when compared to current artists. NOT HENDRIX. His work can stand up to any guitarist today even though he passed away in 1970. This man is still seen as the greatest among the greats. He was something special ; extraordinary. This CD is just further proof of it.
B000002AGN|5.0|I don't know why, but I've loved and collected jazz of all types for years - but Brubeck escaped my notice. In retrospect that's a tragedy. I think this is the best selling jazz album of all time - and it's very clear why. At the time it was original. Now it's still unique. Dave Brubeck took jazz to a new height and a new level. I'm a sure Miles Davis fan (and others) would say I'm wrong - but I think Brubeck set the bar and no one to date has been able to reach a higher level. This is the champagne of jazz . The Christmas album by Brubeck is great, too.
B00005QDW1|1.0|If your a fan of &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; looking for a worthy follow-up album wait a little longer.  Although the music and tone are refreshing and creative, the lyrics are laughable and ruin the album...
B00004THAY|5.0|This is one I heard at a friend's house and had to get it. I liked Clapton back when he Shot the Sheriff - but he's even better laying down a blues track. I think the combination of he and B.B. is like Haley's comet - rare and something you have to experience. Clapton's guitar is as emotional as good blues harmonica (see Charlie Musselwhite) and B.B.'s middle name is probably Blue. When they both sing and play, you also pick up on the mutual respect and fun these two demonstrate. This sort of alignment occurs once in a blue moon.
B00000K19E|2.0|The special effects in &quot;The Matrix&quot; were spellbinding.  Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne weren't exactly suburb actors in the film, but they weren't exactly bad either.  But I feel this movie lacks one principle that makes a great movie: great writing.  Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus walks Neo (portrayed by Keanu Reeves) through a lot of discussion of what the matrix is, in the middle of the film.  This fits into the category of 'exposition', a definite problem with script writing.  It would have been better if the character Neo would have been involved with more drama while actually figuring out what the matrix is.  In a movie like &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the characters are placed in a setting unlike our world...&quot;In a galaxy far, far away.&quot;  The action in &quot;Star Wars&quot; moves from one scene to another without the characters stopping whatever they're doing, then sitting around and explaining how the Millennium Falcon jumps to light speed or how the Death Star destroys planets...the viewer actually sees the stars race across the screen as the Millennium Falcon gets away from the Empire fighters, and see how Princess Lea painfully watches her own planet get destroyed.  In &quot;The Matrix&quot;, besides the long scene that gets bogged down by exposition, there isn't much to character development.  If you take away all the amazing special effects, there wasn't that much in the script to hold the characters together.  I am bothered how this movie is considered a &quot;thinking man's sci-fi thriller&quot;.  After all I just said, I really didn't feel this movie lived up to that promise.
B00000IOSU|5.0|If I had to buy one Sarah McLachlan CD - this would be it. I like her work - but have had other works that I don't play as often.

B000003N89|5.0|I heard All for You for the first time at a friend's house. My taste is eclectic - I have Train, Ella, Savage Garden, Bare Naked Ladies, Alison Kraus and even like listening to &quot;A-team&quot; when my daughter's riding with me in the car (O.K. I admit it!). I lean to jazz - and love jazz piano. Given that - I love this album (and so does my daughter). It gets played more frequently than most of the 20 CD's I bought in the last year. Diana is an original.
B00003CX9S|4.0|this was one of the most disturbing yet brilliant cinematic masterpieces ever brought to the screen. i have always loved this movie and couldn't wait to finally get it on DVD.<br />LOOK OUT!!!, now i have seen everything, this DVD had good extras but guess what; unbelievably there are no chapter selections, i couldn't believe it!!!!!!! isn't one of the main arguments for DVD over videocassette the scene or chapter selections. i totally agree with David the other reviewer for this movie.<br />great film, very disappointing DVD, come on Paramount, you can do better than this!!!!!
B00003CXFU|5.0|I think that almost everyone is familiar with this film version of how Erin Brokovitch took on a large corporation that had knowingly polluted the water supply of a small town, and through their intentional cover-up had adversely affected the health of almost everyone in that town. This is a true life David and Goliath story. Only, in this case, &quot;David's&quot; weapons were chutzpa, perseverance, cleavage, and a big dose of commitment to something she believed in, instead of a sling and a stone.<br />Brockovich was no dummy. To the contrary, as portrayed by Julia Roberts, (one of my favorite actresses!) she was bright, articulate (if a little earthy), and always aware of her impact on people. She had a natural empathy that people could feel. Consequently they liked her and responded to her. This applies, from what I've read, to the real life Brockovich, and certainly to the screen Brockovich. Julia Roberts' manner of dressing was, if anything, toned down a bit from that of the real life Erin Brockovich. For those who found Roberts' attire distracting, I wonder how you would have responded to the real Erin.<br />Albert Finney played her boss, a moderately successful &quot;shirt-sleeve&quot; attorney who had a lot to lose if the lawsuit went awry. He gave this role just the right blend of wit, concern, fear, anger, and elation. He's the attorney that we'd all like to find.<br />I found this movie to be entertaining, well acted, satisfying, and one that I can watch and watch with feeling so happy at the end. See it to know what I mean....
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is a great album: it's melodic every step of the way; it rocks with a staggering and really refreshing, up-beat energy.  I recommend it for anyone who prefers enjoying music to complaining about a perceived lack of innovation.  (I especially like the oft-bemoaned one-dimensional production, which lets me really get into the individual themes, and lets said themes really get into me.)<br />That said, this album has also brought me an incredible amount of pleasure for a second reason: it has hit the mainstream.  That people who can bear to listen to the radio are digging this kind of pure rock and roll is all one could ask for.  Most of the people reading this, in fact, probably discovered Is This It on the radio or MTV, and I don't think you are very well-served by the previous reviews.  This is good music, and there's nothing tired about that -- and that it's good is not really anything that you need to be told.  What I will offer, what I feel is most useful to a new listener, is a list of other indie-pop albums that people I've known with no taste for indie-pop have enjoyed.  You should check them out, if you're interested in albums that have incredible, hard-rocking, melodic, intelligent songs from track 1 to track 12 -- the kind of thing you might imagine if your favorite moment of your favorite &quot;rock&quot; song were extended for 45 minutes:<br />Keep It Like a Secret - Built to Spill<BR>Terror Twilight - Pavement<BR>Emergency and I - Dismemberment Plan<BR>If You're Feeling Sinister - Belle and Sebastian<BR>Sophtware Slump - Grandaddy (especially if you liked OK Comp)<br />These aren't my favorites: these are just what I think you will be able to appreciate without any getting-used-to.<br />Rock and roll doesn't need any saving -- it's alive and well -- it just needs a little appreciation.  Long live The Strokes (has anyone actually wished them well yet?).<br />And if you really wanna have your socks knocked off, go for it, get the best album ever made:Marquee Moon by Television.
B00003CY0U|4.0|SWORDFISH is an action-packed thriller of the Dominic Sena variety, starring John Travolta, Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman and Don Cheadle.  Travolta is an anti-terrorist?  Halle Berry is the leading lady?  Don Cheadle is an FBI special agent.  Hugh Jackman is supposedly one of the best computer hackers in the business.<br />Travolta invites Jackman to become part of the &quot;team&quot;, which is unclear until almost midway into the picture; nevertheless, you know that Travolta is into some bad stuff.  Jackman feels the pressure to join due to his family's demise, and has hopes of gaining custody of his ten-year old daughter from his prodigal ex-wife.  However, there is one problem with gaining custody, and you guessed it, it's money, and Travolta has it and wants more.  This movie is very predictable, but the action will keep you from snoozing.<br />The movie may flounder, but Travolta is top-notch in this one as the calculating (Kingfish), the orchestrator of Operation Swordfish.  He is a bad dude, smarter than a whip, and is a lethal weapon all in one.  His performance is worth seeing the picture.  On the other hand, Berry (Queenfish) is less than a lady in this one, but she is a beauty that &quot;bares&quot; watching.  Her role reminds the viewer of a young Raquel Welch, whom directors plugged into their pictures not for the sake of their acting, but their curves.  In addition, Jackman's (Jackfish) performance is better than good.  Cheadle (FBI-fish) is another tough guy role for him.  Moreover, Camryn Grimes (Jackman's daughter) is outstanding in her limited role as the (Kidfish).  Watch out for her in future films.<br />Take Travolta out of this one and Sena could have called it DEADFISH; nevertheless, even with him it still flounders and is barely a four.  Rated R for Graphic Violence, Sex, and Nudity.
0679735259|1.0|This book over-dramatizes everything.  It's not possible to see a look in a man's face and get 6 ultra-dramatic impressions from it. And then to write about every one of them!! Herr might say,&quot;The look in his face could have sheared off a mountain at its base, chopped it into a million pieces and scattered it over a thousand square miles.  Puuuhlease!!!  A few times in a book such a description adds impact, but this entire book is written this way.  Seldom have I seen an author pound a writing technique to such smitherines as this guy does.
0812550706|5.0|Before reading this book i hated science fiction.  I loved fantasy  but i DESPISED science fiction.  I had never been able to find anything remotely decent.  I was not overly fond of H. G. Wells or Ray Bradbury, and no other &quot;classic&quot; sci fi books were of much interest to me.  That is, until i came to Orson Scott cars's book, Ender's Game.  It was my own fault for not reading it before, my brother owned a copy and urged me to read it.  Even strangers wanted me to read the book.  I was reading a Raymond E. Feist book in an airport, and some guy, a complete stranger came up to me and said that if i liked that, i should read Ender's Game.  I finally gave in, but my pre conceived notions were still too strong.  I read the first chapter and put it down, i could not get into it.  FINALLY, yet another person, a friend of mine also begged me to read it.  He admitted that the begginning had problems, but that it got much better later on.  I remember saying the same thing, in reference to both the Harry Potter books and the Lord of The Rings series: Some of The best books I have ever read.  I decided to tough it out, and read Ender's Game.  I made the mistake of picking it up at 10 o clock at night.  I was awake until three in the morning reading until I was forced to go to bed.  It was a fantastic book, and i eagerly finished the other books, Speaker For The Dead, Xenocide, Children Of The Mind, Ender's Shadow, and Shadow of the Hegemon, in less than 4 days each.  Even now I cant really find any Science Fiction I enjoy, though I have not gotten around to reading Anne Mcaffrey, whom is supposed to write great Sci-fi/Fantasy books.  I even tried 1984 and hated it.  The point that I am attempting to make, and you may be able to discern from my ramblings and endorsemnents of several other books, is that you dont need to have any particular love of Science Fiction to enjoy this book.
B000002QWD|5.0|I don't know if the record still holds up, but for more than 30 years, this Bing Crosby holiday album ranked as the best-selling Christmas album ever--and with good reason. It warms your heart just like watching &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; and it's practically an audio record of what America once was and will never be again. What a wonderful CD. Cheap at three times the price. Also--buy this one and not MCA's ridiculously overpriced OTHER holiday multi-CD pack, which isn't nearly as enjoyable. What in the world is this CD doing on MCA Special Products and not the regular MCA label? Crazy empty suits at the label, obviously.
0679731725|5.0|The word dignity that concerns Stevens so in this novel comes from the latin dignitas &lt; dignus, worthy. This novel by Ishiguro is worthy of the Booker prize it recieved and much praise from all quarters. Like his previous two novels there is a strong theme here of realization of having backed the wrong horse ,so to speak, and how to proceed from there. This, Ishiguro's third effort, reaches masterpiece quality in form, prose, restraint, and narrative. A previous reviewer's comparison to Chekhov is very apt. Steven's the samurai slash english gentry butler of Darlington hall has spent his life serving what he thought was a great man, Lord Darlington. Darlington , it turns out was an unwitting pawn of the Nazi's in diplomacy between Nazi Germany and England. Steven's realizes this along with his missed romantic chances in his past and it breaks his heart. He must decide a worthy way to spend the remains of his day. Stevens although not a perfect human is a refreshing literary character with his selfless devotion, civility, and ideals. His struggle to learn how to banter and joke is the most touching and humorous part of the book. This is a modern day classic!
B00005QDW1|1.0|I used to think that Shelby Lynne's \\"Love, Shelby\\" was the worst release by a major artist in 2001, but here comes No Doubt's \\"Rock Steady.\\" I've never heard such a lazy, ridiculous, tuneless, pointless release. Poorly played dance tracks from the band that brought us great introspective rock tunes? It's obvious that Gwen Stefani is now much more interested in being a POP STAR than an being, an artist with anything important to say, and let's face it, with a face and body like her's, that's not hard to do. But give up on No Doubt--it simply isn't much of a band to begin with, and look for Gwen's \\"motion picture acting debut\\" any minute now. WHAT a disappointment. Bye, bye, No Doubt...
B00003CXTG|1.0|This was the absolute, most terrible movie I've ever seen.  It was historically inaccurate and filled with every romantic-drama cliche there is.  If Michael Bay wanted to make a romance, he could left history out of it.  I think the event of Pearl Harbor itself is quite dramatic enough for a film, without having to add sex and betrayal. The saddest part is that people are actually going to watch this movie think that FDR actually drew attention to his disability so blatantly, when in fact he never would have done anything like struggle to his feet that way.  And no one died on the Doolittle Raid.  Only Kamakaze pilots wore the rising sun head bands and they weren't used until 1944.  And turning the struggle that followed the attack into a game of chicken?  The utter disrespect for the people who suffered through Pearl Harbor is abhorent and I cannot believe that more people do not feel this way.
B00005NW02|5.0|(...)<br />Being an \\"old school\\" fan of real bands and music, Systems of a Down delivers real and true earcandy; one only has to listen to their first 1998 album to know that this band had something special.  Their sophomore effect in no way disappoints but rather kicks you (...) with such songs as \\"Prison\\" and \\"Needles.\\"  <br />System of a Down's Armenian background is proudly displayed by their incorporation of hardcore music with definite Middle Eastern overtones... just the deliverance of Serj Tankian's unique vocal style combined with Daron Malakian's aggressive guitar riffs hits new heights of musical ecstasy--a must hear for true hardcore fans.  <br />While this type of music is not for everyone, you may have to develop a taste for it, it truly worth the time to tickle your tastebuds with something new.
B00005QDW1|5.0|For those fans who are ONLY looking for &quot;Tragic Kingdom Part 2&quot; should skip right past No Doubt's latest release.  &quot;Rock Steady&quot; is the band's most experimental release to date, pushing away from a hard-core ska base onto a more radio-friendly, electronica/reggae/techno level. While listening to &quot;Rock Steady,&quot; you can definately recognize the usual No Doubt vibe, but this album gives your ears more twists and turns that many fans of &quot;Trapped in A Box&quot; and &quot;Don't Speak&quot; will not appreciate to the max.<br />The album begins with an &quot;Intro&quot; which lays down the chorus for the title track on the album.  Then, &quot;Hella Good,&quot; one of the most catchy, energetic tracks on the album pumps through your speakers.  &quot;Hella Good&quot; is some of No Doubt's best work to date, and its chorus remains in your head all day long.  Other tracks that follow the footsteps of &quot;Hella Good&quot; are &quot;Making Out,&quot; &quot;Detective,&quot; and &quot;In My Head.&quot;  <br />The new single, &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; foreshadows the new album perfectly because it mixes pop-influenced beats with R&amp;B influenced vocals.  Since Gwen teamed up with rapper Eve for the amazing track &quot;Let Me Blow Your Mind,&quot; it shows that her musical tastes are diversifying and expanding to other musical genres.  Gwen's duet with Moby, &quot;South Side,&quot; shows her choice to dive into the electronica wave that has captured many artists such as Madonna and Janet Jackson.  I have a lot of respect for bands who aren't afraid to experiment with their music to remain fresh.  It is not condsidered &quot;selling out,&quot; but an opportunity to branch out and experience new types out music while keeping an original sound as a basis.  No Doubt is a perfect example of a band who can shine through many different musical tastes.<br />Even though the whole album is worth a complete listen, songs like the Ric Ocasek produced &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; and the title track, &quot;Rock Steady,&quot; are incredible, along with the others I listed above.  However, the best song on the album is &quot;Waiting Room,&quot; a duet with Prince which has the whole package.  Its techno-influenced beats make the track one you can dance to, and it gives Gwen the opportunity to expand her vocal range unlike ever before.  Both Gwen and Prince collide together and connect perfectly on this track, and the chorus is incredibly catchy.<br />Once again, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; is simply a unique album for No Doubt that can do no wrong.  The energy that the whole band holds throughout each song is unlike any of their other efforts.  Even though both &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; are solid releases, I believe this album is the epitomy of No Doubt's best musical work to date.  This style is unlike the two albums before &quot;Tragic Kingdom,&quot; too, but it is definately talent-influenced music.  If you are a No Doubt fan and OPEN-MINDED, do not be afraid.  &quot;Rock Steady&quot; will give you everything you need to quench your &quot;No Doubt fix&quot; and then some.  However, if you only like the band for their previous efforts, then remain thirsty and wait for the new Limp Bizkit CD.
B00005NW02|5.0|Excellent CD!  Alternative rock that blends great music, great vocals, with a hard hitting, important message!  I'd recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys alternative rock music!
B00003CXTG|5.0|When this movie came to the local cinema I stayed away because of the lack of good reviews.  So when it came to DVD I decided to rent it.  I'm so glad I did.  It's a great story of friendship and love trying to survive in an uncertain time.  The attack on Pearl Harbor was done perfectly.  I loved every minute of this movie.<br />So now I'm off to buy the DVD.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|My wife and I went to see this one in the theater while the kids (aged 5 and 8) were out of town.  Knowing it was PG, we wanted to review it before the kids saw it.  From the viewpoint of adults, it was a great comedic fairy tale.  <br />But showing this to children is a bad idea for two reasons:<BR>  -vulgarity.  Eddie Murphy's character uses words we don't use in our house.  If I hear my children's friends using these words, we tell their parents about it.<BR>  -rudeness.  The three main characters treat each other with disrespect and sarcasm that is not appropriate for small children to experience.  Many modern kids movies do this (Hercules, for example), but my kids don't have to see it.

B00000613T|5.0|I have been waiting all my life for a performance of Mahler's Ninth such as this.  The &quot;over-interpretation&quot; of Mahler is a sticky argument that we could spend the rest of our lives arguing over, just let me say, I love Bernstein and his highly emotional and charged recordings of the Ninth.  But Boulez allows us to truly understand the genius of Mahler's writing and orchestration.  Every line is clean and unlike the intense dynamic extremes in other recordings of Mahlher's symphonies I've heard that might sound good in a live hall, this studio recording is clear from start to finish with an ambience that doesn't try to manipulate the sound, or for that matter, the audience.  The opening andante is one of the most beautiful versions I have heard.  Even and crisp, the opening motif speaks for itself, without the &quot;emotional&quot; tweaking many conductors try to milk out of it.  The way the opening motif is written, why mess around with it?  Mahler's genius stands alone.  The sentimentality and the plaintive tone of the composition is in the notes.  In fact, after listening to Boulez's version, many other recordings (including my old favorite Bernstein's) seem maudlin and less profound because of this.  I don't believe one can be right or wrong in their opinion of this piece, it is expansive enough to cover a wide range of interpretations, but I am of the &quot;anti-SWOON&quot; school of classical music.  Call it cold, but it moves me.  I love subtext and don't need everything explained to me.

0792844793|5.0|Very suspensful, well filmed and just a great film altogether. It has some pretty disturbing imagery and Dennis Hopper is pretty damn insane as usual, but he adds everything to this film. If you agree with what I am saying then I highly HIGHLY recommend Red Rock West. Another very cool thriller with Hopper and Nicholas Cage. Enjoy!

B00005U122|5.0|This DVD is of the Portland, Oregon concert which I saw.  This is, without a doubt, the BEST concert I've ever been to.  His renditions of Pink Floyd material are truer than the Pink Floyd Ltd. version in Delicate Sound Of Thunder and Pulse.  His version of Shine On You Crazy Diamonds, with the back drop picture of Syd Barrett in the back ground, brought a tear to my eye.  Please, buy this DVD, sit back and enjoy.  It's 2 1/2 quality hours of entertainment you will never forget.  I won't.
B00004X01U|4.0|Before you freak out about the cd cover, Madonna has not gone country. In fact, this is Madonna's \\"real\\" dance album since her debut. Gone is the operatic voice, clunky electronic music, and \\"I'm the Mother of Spirituality\\" image. Now she is a forty year old mother, who still can hang out with the weirdos, the gays and the club kids late at night.<br />Music: Thanks to Madonna's new producer, French DJ Mirwais, the music is a lot more stripped down and acoustic guitar driven. Suprisingly, William Orbit changes his sound to a more 60's, 70's rock sound, but with a dance groove. At times the synth oriented sounds can be emotionally cold and distant but it still raises the bar of what American pop can do.<br />Voice: Madonna forgets her \\"Evita\\" voice lessons and goes back to a more plaintive, naked style reminescent of her \\"True Blue\\" stage. She uses effects on some of the up-tempo tracks, but on \\"I Deserve It\\" and \\"Gone\\" her singing is dry with just electronic squiggles and a guitar. It just proves that a person doesn't need to have a 5 million octave voice to show emotions.<BR>  <br />Lyrics: Even though this is a dance album, the lyrics are not generic. \\"Don't Tell Me\\" expresses her resistance of quitting her day job, \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" talks about how unfairly treated women and girls are in society, and \\"I Deserve It\\" tells of her new \\"Guy\\". It's her best love song since \\"Take A Bow\\". But the best lyric-driven song is \\"Nobody's Perfect\\". It's her plea for her former lover to forgive her. Her most convincing \\"please forgive me song\\".<br />Standout Tracks: \\"Music\\" is a 70's funk tune whose simplicity is quite surprising. With all the bombastics of pop music today this basic dance song is a great welcome. It's chorus will be stuck in your mind for days. \\"I Deserve It\\" is just her dry voice, a guitar and electronic squiggles which gives the song a more personal feel. \\"Amazing\\" (where Madonna's voice shines)is a 60's esque brit-pop song that will make you dance. \\"Don't Tell Me\\" is a strange combination of dance, club, pop, and country. In your head you'll think, \\" What the world is this?\\", but you'll never stop dancing to it. I could go on and on, but i only have the maxium of 1,000 words.<BR> <BR>Recommend: Yes. If you like Madonna' s chamelon like music or if you like dance music. :)
0452282152|5.0|I could not put this book down from the second I read the opening line.  As an artist, I reveled in the simple details of Vemeer's life, and could not pull myself from the window into what life was like for families in the 1700's Europe.  The author writes of Griet (the subject of Vermeer's famous painting) in such a unique and versatile way, which makes her someone we all can identify with.  A work of fiction written with such substance and conviction one believes this story has to have been real.  This is a book for anyone who loves to read, with the slightest appreciation for the arts and history.  In today's world, there's a desire to regress to a time when things seemed to be more simple, and this book displays that time nor any amount of technological advances will ever change what is essential to human life - love and family.
B00004TJLD|5.0|NO whining about it not being &quot;as advertised&quot;.  Amazon is the party not being clear about this, other retail sites make it very clear as to the product you're purchasing.  It's a DAD version, not DVD-A, which means no 5:1.  Also, to hear it fully, you'll need a DVD player that handles 24bit/96khz.  Older DVD players will play it but at 48khz.<br />And this version is significantly better than any of the MFSL versions out there.  The MFSL version doesn't have the bass depth of even the regular Arista CD version although it is obviously cleaner sounding.  This DAD version makes up for that problem and really shines when on songs like &quot;Don't Let It Show&quot;, &quot;The Voice&quot;, and &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; where you get some of the cleanest sound keyboards to be heard on stereo.  If you sit down and listen to the MFSL version to this side-by-side with the DAD version, you'll hear all kinds of differences and be able to hear some of the layers that just got lost in the past.<br />This version is well worth purchasing even if you have various other versions of the album.  And if you haven't purchased it, if you like prog rock, this album is one of the best.
B00005176F|5.0|Great Song choice except for the fact that Popscene, perhaps the greatest song they ever did (and it virtually invented Brit-pop) is not on this compilation...Thank goodness it was added to the Am. version of Modern Life Is Rubbish...but anyways, buy this and you will fall in love with Blur's music...no question about it.
B00005R2M3|4.0|The first time I ever heard (and saw) Shakira was her Saturday Night Live appearance.  I was floored.  My musical tastes are generally metal, metal, and more metal.  I decided to watch and listen.  Her band was great and Shakira is the most original performer I've seen in ages.  What was most important was that she really seemed to be having fun.  I immediately ordered LAUNDRY SERVICE.<br />After giving LAUNDRY SERVICE a couple of listens I wasn't disappointed.  I would tend to agree with some other reviews in that I feel that the Spanish lyrics seem to be more fluid at times but I wouldn't hesitate to buy another CD she puts out.  I think that at times her English vocals are hard to catch because that excellent band almost drowns them out.  I'm not complaining.  Believe me.  I just think the mixing could be ever so slightly adjusted.  Besides...being into metal for many many years I'm used to picking up the liner notes and reading lyrics.  Right now I'm excited to be hearing the new fusion of sounds and all she has to say.<br />If you've been searching for something original that rocks give SHAKIRA's LAUNDRY SERVICE a listen.  I doubt you'll be disappointed.  She's like a pop star except more of a rock fusion star.  Oh yea... and she's got talent to spare.  They may be &quot;small and humble&quot; but that's fine. They might get in the way of all that talent.<br />I can't believe I've gone from Black Sabbath to Zeppelin to ACDC to Iron Maiden to Metallica to Sepultura and on the lighter side U2.  Now I'm listening to Shakira?  She's that good.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Excellent english debut.  But what else would you expect.  Shakira has always been an amazing artist!  I had no doubt I would love this album and I do.  It gets better with every listening.  No other artist is as poetic nor sings with the same feeling.  Can't wait for more!

B00005JKT8|4.0|A sweet, simple love story with a time travel twist.<br />Meg Ryan does a serviceable job in this flick, though not nearly as good as some of her other past films like You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, or I.Q.,  but I'd guess that was more due to the script and direction.<br />Hugh Jackman was awesome, playing a nobleman from early America. It's a great contrast to the Wolverine role he played in X-men.  While in X-men, he was a somewhat coarse and wild, yet principled &quot;wildman, &quot; here he plays a totally genteel, polished gentleman whose straightforward honesty and candor make the girls who meet him just wriggle with romantic ecstasy, while inspiring nobler sentiments in the men.<br />There's only one short scene where time travel is really batted around. The rest of the film is a fun, not overdone exploration of how a gentleman from the past would respond to our contemporary world. And, without ruining the ending, it makes us nostalgic for the simple courtesies and chivalries of the past. At one point though, when feeling this, I also realized that it left out the harsh realities-- that back in time, there were a good proportion of cretinously sexist, racist, ignorant, wealthy pigs. Jackman is playing an idealized male romantic hero, as one might find in a Harlequin romance.<br />I also really enjoyed the role played by Liev Schreiber, the besieged (ala One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; by psychiatry discoverer of the time warp which made this story possible.<br />There are a number of magical moments in the story-- and it's magic which melts the heart and pulls those heartstrings for which we pay the eight bucks to see the movie on the big screen.<br />This is light fare, and sometimes, the light-fare genre just hits the spot. Great music helps on this soundtrack.<br />One thing though. His uniform, as shown in the trailer and throughout the film, appears to be mroe fitting to the end of the 1700s, not the 1800s. But they repeatedly say he has traveled from the late 1800s. Then, at one point, they say he's 200 years old, which would match his outfit. It looks like the writers got confused on the script. Oh well. It really doesn't hurt the story an iota.raveled from the late 1800s. Then, at one point, they say he's 200 years old, which would match his outfit.

B00003CXXS|5.0|I bought a dvd player today &amp; I also bought as a first dvd Jurassic Park 3 because I love dinosaurs.  This movie was incredible, it is full of action and the dinosaurs look unbelievable.  I can't describe this movie in words, it's simply incredible.<br />The DVD is also full of great features, they have so many options like interviews, behind the scenes, special effects and I especially liked the feature where they show real digging of dinosaurs.  It kind of reminds you that yes, dinosaurs ruled this planet and they did exist, something that we sometimes forget while watching a &quot;movie&quot;.<br />This movie is definitly much better then the second jurassic park (the Lost World).  It's hard to choose which one is better between Jurassic III and the first one because they are very different.  The first one had a magical feeling about it because it was the first time we saw the dinosaurs, it was special.  However the third one is kind of a thrill ride based on a lot of action.  <br />In conclusion, if you like dinosaurs or if you simply like great action movies, get this dvd, you will be fully entertained!
630289915X|5.0|It seems kind of pointless reviewing a film as well known and often-seen as It's A Wonderful Life, but I would like to throw in what I think makes this film so great:  The performance of James Stewart.  This film has become such a Holiday fixture I think it's easy to lose sight of just what he did in this film.  It's an amazing performance, so full of honesty and emotion.  It's perhaps one of the most real performances ever given on film, and it certainly stands the test of time.  I've read the original story that this film was based on, and as good as it is, the film surpasses it.  It's an excellent adaptation, fleshing out the characters more and adding so much more conflict and detail.  The supporting cast is terrific, with such reliable actors as Lionel Barrymore, Beulah Bondi, Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell, Gloria Grahame, Ward Bond, and of course, the wonderful Henry Travers.  The story reminds us of the impact each of our lives has on those around us, an impact we might not even appreciate.  And at a time like Christmas, when we think of family and friends, it's something we need to be reminded of.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|This is a great dvd that fully entertained me.  It has 23 videos (the new version that is out there right now has 2 extra videos), some unbelievable live performances, great interviews, behind the scenes footage and other things that I'm probably forgetting.  Whitney is a very beautiful woman to look at, she's gorgeous!  As for her talent, in my opinion she's the greatest singer of all-time and this dvd proves it.<br />The highlights of the dvd in my opinion are the amazing &quot;One Moment In Time at the grammy's&quot;, the historic &quot;The Star Spangled Banner at Superbowl XXV&quot; and Whitney's great &amp; long interview where she talks about several important moments in her career.  There are so many videos on it, you can never be bored.  It has also so many great performances like &quot;Why Does It Hurt So Bad on MTV movie awards&quot;, her first ever TV performance singing &quot;Home&quot; and I could go on forever!!<br />IMO, anybody who's a fan of Whitney Houston or anyone who simply is a little bit interested in her should get the dvd.  It's full of hours of entertainement.  The sound &amp; picture are also great (but of course the sound in a performance like &quot;Home in 1985&quot; doesn't sound as good as for example &quot;My Love is Your Love live in germany 1999&quot; obviously because it's much older, but it still sounds great).<br />In conclusion, I have no complaints &amp; I think that this is one of the best dvds I own.  Everyone should get it &amp; I really hope Whitney releases other music dvds soon!

0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller is often credited with fathering the modern slasher flick, but it must be kept in mind that this top-notch film is far more than that.  The innovative plot structure, which can never be repeated with the same effect, is a masterful way of making the viewer empathize with the victim and feel the shock and loss of murder.  Too many of the films that followed chose to empathize with the killer.  This is a crucial difference that allows Hitchcock's film to retain a certain humane quality, even as terrible things are happening on-screen.
0684833395|5.0|This is hands-down one of the best books ever written.  As absurd as it seems while you're reading it, you know it's only funny because it's all truth about human nature, and everyone I've met who's read it has affirmed my opinion.
B000059ZLH|3.0|Yes, the music IS great, and I've drooled at the the excellent musicmanship that DT can convey as much on stage as in the studio, and this is no small feat.<BR>BUT (And this a major BUT), The short video clips that were suuposed to get me into the story are so amateurly made that I've just laughed and laughed. Seems to be the crossing between a 10-year old boy trying to make a horror movie, and a *VERY BAD* student flick, the psychedelic effects that accompany the live video were also pretty much hilarious...and the transition effects.. why, god?!?!! I can bare watching such effects in '70 video-clips, when they were just learning to use 'em (\\"wow look, we can split the image to 2, then to 4, then to 64,000! this surely will entertain audiences forever\\").<BR>And as other people noted, the Audio quality is rather poor for a DVD, and the balance is all wrong.<BR>So should you buy it or not? If you're a DT fan, the answer is still yes. There's more than enough left in this disc to make you grin (and a good laugh is something too of course).

0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange has been reguarded as one of the best contemporary classics of today.  It is the story of Alex, a member of a gang in a future Britain.  Alex goes around amassing destruction, robbery, rape, and murder to his criminal record before being betrayed and sent to jail, where he undergoes a controversial treatment.<br />This treatment is a basic exercise of Pavlov's conditioning in which Alex is taught to hate everything he loves, so that he could leave the institute within two weeks of arriving there.  Unfortunately, nothing turns out the way Alex wanted.<br />A Clockwork Orange is a very good book on realizing why we are the way we are.  Because of Alex's loss of choice, we learn through Burgess a great deal about how being able to do bad things is so important.<br />The only deterrent to reading this book is the amount of violence, drug-taking, rape, and other things that might be found on a FOX tv show, which were banned worldwide at the time it was published, in the 1950's.  If you thought Catcher in the Rye was a immoral book, I wouldn't recommend this, but for those who can stomach the violence to realize the point are well worthy of reading this book.<br />This version of A Clockwork Orange is almost the same as the American version, except that it has a foreword written by Burgess himself, as well as the last chapter which was not published in America.  This book is a very good read, and a great addition to the avid reader's library.<br />Two thumbs up!

B000002UB6|4.0|It's funny to rate my favorite Beatles' album less than a *5*, but it's inevitable considering many labored passages, wrongheaded editing (why use an inferior guitar break on \\"Let It Be\\", and abbreviate \\"Get Back\\"?), overdone strings (you know which one) and much unnecessary druggy recording session dialogue which wears out its' welcome by the third playback. The album works for me for many reasons, particularly because of the open-air, spontaneous feel (quite the antithesis of heavily \\"produced\\" offerings like \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", et. al.), and the great contribution from ol' buddy Billy Preston who brings some much needed bounce and funk to the arrangements - his electric piano adds icing to the cake on \\"Get Back\\" and \\"I've Got A Feeling\\". On the early '60s leftover, the '50s styled \\"One After 909\\", however, his jazz-based support does not work. (Fans dig the \\"Anthology\\" version which is straight ahead R & R).<BR>There are three masterpieces on the album: the brilliant, philosophical entries \\"Across The Universe\\", \\"Let It Be\\", and \\"The Long And Winding Road\\". There is enough music in these three tracks for a whole album.<BR>Afterthought: the order of the last two songs should have been \\"The Long..\\" and \\"One After 909\\". What do you think?
B00004TRD8|4.0|\\"TERMINATOR 2-JUDGMENT DAY\\" is a great movie on a super great disk. Only one problem. There are too many features! Don't get me wrong, I love special features just like the next guy. But you get too many of one feature. Example, you get OVER 20 \\"making of\\" or \\"behind the scenes\\" The DVD has ALMOST every feature except camera angles. It has 3 versions of T2 on it (one is hidden. (...) ). Besides that let's look at my review:<br />                    TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY<BR>T2 is a classic! Ask anyone. The movie starts out about John Conners when he is 13 years old. (...) He meets up with the T-1000. A newer and better robot than T100. Don't worry, T100 is back! He is now here to protect John from the T1000 because jhe failed to kill Sarah Conners from the first film.

0743420373|2.0|The whole book can be summed up in one phrase: save your money, be frugal and you too can be a millionaire.  Really?!?!  Although the studies are somewhat interesting the whole book seems to be a bunch of numbers that prove the same point in fifty thousand different ways.  So, save your money.  The authors do bring up a valid point when they say that most millionaires do not look and act the part of the \\"Hollywood millionaire,\\" but isn't that obvious?  If you spend all of your income on expensive, frivolous, luxury items, of course you are not going to have enough left over to qualify as a millionaire.  I guess the book is good to read if you are one of those people that are given everything from your parents.  If you don't have a budget plan and are constantly buying the most expensive items, then maybe this book will \\"change your life.\\"  However, I would hope that what is mentioned in the book is common sense to most people.  Save your money and save your time.

B00000GAIW|5.0|(...)<br />This album is definately Jethro Tull's most dark work. Ian Anderson's talents explode on this album. His obvious anger toward organized religion seems to lean towards the Roman-Cathlic church.  This albums lyrics aren't always consistant, however, take my favorite song \\"Mother Goose\\" what the heck is that about? Not religion. And then there is the overrated but stil good \\"Locomotive Breath\\" that doesn't mean anything either. <br />Aqulung--The title track is absolutely amazing. This was the first song of Tull's that I had ever heard. Thanks to my Mom. Anway this whole song is absolutely wonderful, there is nothing else like it. My mom is getting a record player with a CD player built in as well, and you can bet that, after I get \\"Stand Up\\", and Captain Beefheart's \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" on vinyl, That Aqualung is next on my list. <br />Cross-eyed Mary and Cheap day return--C.E.M. is a slightly disturbing song (lyrically) but absolutely amazing musically. Cheap day return is sort of stupid. Also it's very short, it kind of gave me the feeling that I was listening to filler. I still like it though.<br />Mother Goose--This is my favorite track on the album. It sounds very folk-like, wiht very little electric guitar. I guess why I like it is because of Ian Anderson's absolutly amazing voice. Not to mention the percussion which is no less than wonderful. Over all an absolutely fabulous song.<br />Wond'ring Aloud & Up to me--W.A. is soft, and perfect (in that all it is is what it's supposed to be). Up to me is harder and more electric than W.A., with a wonderful flute runnng thru the entire thing. Also I must again mention the drums,<BR>absolutely amazing. <br />My God & Hymn 43-- Are Anderson's two main songs about the Roman Catholic Church. What's he got against them? I dunno, but good music.<br />Slip Stream & Locomotive breath--Sklipstream is one of those songs that don't really make it a priority to be consistant with the rest of the album. It is unfortunately short, but it is still wonderful. Locomotive breath is far to overrated, it sounds very jazzy which is good, but there's just this lack af lyrical genious that Tull is none for. <br />Wind Up (regular and quad--Definately a stand-out on the album. Lyrical genious shines on this song. This, if I'm not mistaken, is talking about Anderson's schoolteachers. Very good. <BR> <BR>Lick Your Fingers Clean--My other favorite song on the album. Completely perfect. The guitar shines on this song like a strobe light in a 3000 year old cave. Not to mention the tremendous vocals.      <br />Over all, this is a must-have rock album, and quite possibly one of the top twenty. Buy it, you will not be sorry.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Where did this come from? how can something this good actually exist? a warning: this disc will completely ruin about 95% of your cd collection.  And the other 5% left will sound pretty stale in comparison.  There are a few records that might be able to tread water with this juggernaut but certainly none of them offer up 19 tracks you will need to hear to over and over again. Even the best albums have filler, this contains virtually none. To those of you who complain about the songs lacking a meaning or purpose, just be quiet.  The chorus to lost in the supermarket is about as clever and biting an attack on consumerism as it gets. &quot;I came in here for a special offer, guaranteed personality.&quot; The line Lou Barlow wishes he thought of. Just go buy it, if you don't like it send me an e-mail and i'll buy it back from you.  Peace

B00005QDW5|5.0|This is by far the greatest collection of songs from arguably the finest rock band ever! It starts in the 1960s with one of the band's earliest hits and ends with Barrett's &quot;Bike&quot;. Don't fret another minute, by this CD and get Comfortably Numb.
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory is one of the best albums out there.  You can listen to this cd over and over and never get tired of it.  It has the mixture of rock/rap that actually sounds good unlike other bands.  This is definitely a cd you want to buy for yourself and your friends.
0783226845|5.0|If you do not own this DVD you are missing out on AL at his best... Al pacino made this movie and I mean he realy made this movie what it is becasue of an Oscar winning perfomans that no one deserved more than him. My dad and I still turn it to the last part of the movie to listen To Al Pacinos speech... I wish I can give Als acting 20 stars, if it was possible because he is an incredible actor.....5 stars, I wish I could give more.... Buy this DVD, and see what true acting is....
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina's songs speak volumes and this CD is truly a must-have.  It is everything a greatest hits record should be - all of her biggest hits (where is &quot;It's my Time&quot;???) neatly packaged, along with a handful of new songs.  Martina and producer Paul Worley offer cut-by-cut comments as well.<br /><br />The new material is just incredible!  &quot;Blessed&quot; (written by Troy Verges), reunites Martina with former backup singer Carolyn Dawn Johnson, who just 'makes' the track.  The CD version of &quot;God Fearin' Women&quot; is longer than most radio stations played and well worth the price of the CD for the intro.  &quot;Concrete Angel&quot; is the story of a little girl lost and is akin to John Michael Montgomery's &quot;The Little Girl&quot;.  &quot;Where Would You Be&quot; is a Martina trademark song, wondering about love, but in a way that real women do.<br /><br />The already released material is all great, Martina's powerful breakout hit &quot;Independence Day&quot;, the somewhat trite &quot;I Love You&quot;, my favorite &quot;Wild Angels&quot; and &quot;Love's the Only House&quot;.  Martina truly has one of the best voices in country music right now, as evidenced in &quot;Broken Wing&quot;, it is so real it will give you chills!

B00005QDW1|1.0|Awful.  That's all I can say.  The quality of No Doubt's music has gone steadily downhill these past few years, Tragic Kingdom being their springboard into not onky bad work, but shockingly ba work.  This album from what used to be a break-out punk/ska band?  Excuse me, but I say no.  The album is dominated by recycled and unoriginal songs that have no message at all.  Can someone please tell me the significance of such crap as &quot;Hey Baby&quot;?  I can't believe this album was allowed to be made.  Nothing about it warrants any merit.  Gwen Stefani, yet again, dominates the band and music with her highly developed &quot;Madonna on Crack&quot; performances and dress.  All I can say is, this album was a waste of time, and now I realize that being a fan of this band was a waste of time, too.  If you have ever liked No Doubt, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Yes it can, Directed by one of the greatest directors of our time Michael Mann and a little bit of Val Kilmer and you got your self one of the best movies of all time....<br />Let me say this I don't do reviews a lot but I think this movie has the two best Actors in the Bizz at this moment going up against each other. The first time I saw that movie it sent shivers down my back when they sat across from each other...<br />I love this movie, it is on my top 10 list of all time favorit movies... I can't give this movie less than Five stars, becasue not only are both AL and Robert in it, it is a great movie made by a great Director......<br />Michael Mann (Latest Movie Insider, And ALI)<br />Al Paccino (Insider)<br />Robert De Niro (15 Minutes, Meet the Parent, Meet the Fockers)
B0000029GA|5.0|This is the best album ever made, no doubt! This is an instant classic... I couldn't believe my ears when I first heard this album, it's just THAT great! I don't know how to describe this album, I can only say that this is a CLASSIC and it's a must have if you like hip hop! Nas puts out the very best on this album, the beats are superb and his flow is better than ever, I never heard anyone rappin' like Nas does on this album, it's so pure and perfect! Nas was, is and will allways be the best lyricist and he defenitly proves that on this album! On his next albums he still raps thight and all but still, this album has something the others doesn't have, NO one of his other albums came close to this! And no respect for Jay-Z 'cause Nas allready won the war and Jay-Z knows that, he just won't admitt! Well, all I can say 'bout this is that it is the best hip hop album ever and that if you don't own it you must buy it!<BR>Still the poet... Still the prophet... Stillmatic
B000002UCN|4.0|When looking at &quot;The Best of George Harrison&quot;, people naturally seem to fixate on two things: the inclusion of Beatles tracks, and the lack of Harrison's later solo material. Consequently, while this collection is far from ideal, it really doesn't get the appreciation it merits.<br />Remember, first of all, that the album was originally released in 1976, and closed out Harrison's contract with EMI. For that reason, it may help to think of &quot;The Best of George Harrison&quot; as George Harrison's Contractual Obligation Album.<br />It also helps to remember that &quot;The Best of George Harrison&quot; was basically a singles collection (most of the Beatles tracks notwithstanding), and Harrison's success as a solo artist was rather spotty. His attempts to forge his own identity as a solo artist in the face of his audience's expectations that he also remain a Beatle are well documented (see Rolling Stone's coverage of his 1974 tour). His albums received mixed reviews - many of the reviews of &quot;Dark Horse&quot; were downright scathing, for example - and in the six years between the official breakup of the Beatles and the realese of this collection, he did not enjoy the same success on the singles charts as John, Paul, or even Ringo.<br />As a result, there were fewer solo tracks to include on this collection. (Record companies did not go out of their way to exploit b-sides at the time, so, of course, it is no surprise that none of Harrison's non-LP b-sides were included.) But, EMI couldn't very well release a singles collection with only six songs on it so...<br />As it turned out, there was something of a resurgence in Beatlemania taking place in 1976. &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Music&quot; [sic], the first in a series of new Beatles compilations (&quot;Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;, &quot;Love Songs&quot;, &quot;Reel Music&quot;, and &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot; would follow over the next four or five years) was released, and &quot;Got to get you into my life&quot; and &quot;Ob-la-di, ob-la-da&quot; were released as singles - and were hits. So...<br />Problem solved. EMI adds a handful of Harrison-penned Beatles tracks, and &quot;The Best of George Harrison&quot;, circa 1976, is complete.<br />At first glance, this would seem like an obvious, contrived marketing ploy - which it is. BUT, it's also an opportunity to remind people (Hello, Frank Sinatra!) that Lennon &amp; McCartney were not the only songwriters in the Beatles. Including some of Harrison's key Beatles songs on this compilation does that. As Paul McCartney wrote (albeit in reference to silly love songs), what's wrong with that?<br />Finally, one must remember that everything Harrison released after 1976 was recorded for other labels. Without some sort of licensing agreement (such as the ones Yoko Ono and Paul McCartney apparently worked out with EMI), a comprehensive overview of Harrison's post-Beatles career is unlikely to appear. Sometimes, you just have to take what you can get.ife&quot; and &quot;Ob-la-di, ob-la-da&quot; were released as singles - and were hits. So...<br />Problem solved.

0385505833|5.0|This book was delightful.  Great light reading and trust me you won't be able to put it down.  It makes the reader think \\"what if\\".  If the world around you gets used of you doing one thing and you decide to change; in someways you have messed up a part of their world as well.  That's what I loved about this story.  All the years I just wanted to skip all the aspects and commericalism of Christmas and totally forgetting the real true meaning of it.
B00005QDW1|4.0|All the reviews I've read say that this album sounds a lot different than previous No Doubt albums.  From what I've heard from other albums this is different.  I like how the music sounds now better.  My fave song on the CD is Hey Baby. Rock Steady doesn't sound a thing like I thought it would. Not that that's a paticularly bad thing.  If you're a first time No Doubt puchaser then let me tell you that the sound of they CD can't be fairly judged by Hey Baby if that's the only song you've heard.<br />I did that, but I still like the rest of the album anyhow.
0805062971|5.0|Besides this book kicks (...)!! I watched the movie and read the book and both were great!  The book gives you more info than the movie which makes it a bit better. I'm a woman and I totally understand what the author was trying to get across, it's not just a book about guy beating each other's brains out, it's a novel that really makes you think, about your purpose in life about where you're going and where the next generation may be headed, I'm not going to say anymore besides get this book if you don't buy another book in your life!
B00000JHAU|5.0|Precious, seductively charming, and brilliantly written, this album is the best of a band whose entire opus is delicately stitched together with genius.  Totally unlike any pop music you can hear on the radio, these songs are rife with pop hooks that you won't be able to stop singing to yourself no matter how hard you try.  Likely, though, you won't be trying very hard.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|The album has some good songs on it from The Beatles. And it helps to attract a younger gerneration, including me (They were broke up over 15 years before I was born). But it stereotypes the Beatles as being the group that sang &quot;I want to Hold your Hand&quot;, &quot;Love me Do&quot;, and &quot;Can't buy me Love&quot; among others along those lines and sound, and nothing else. Towards the end of the CD it gets into some of there &quot;new style&quot; of music, but not nearly enough. Many of the great songs that true Beatles fans know and love such as &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, &quot;A Day in a Life&quot;, and &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;.  If your wanting to start listen to the Beatles and were thinking about getting this album as a start, it's a fairly good choice. But you'd be doing yourself a favor if you purchased &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour, and/or &quot;Revolver&quot; and  get some of the best songs they wrote, but never reached #1, so were left off this album. Sure buying several CD's instead of one may be more costly, but it's a choice you won't regret.
B00003CY5J|4.0|A superb cast, a continuously surprising plot, and breathless action sequences mark &quot;The Score&quot; as a terrific heist thriller in the tradition of the caper genre. Director Frank Oz has created a movie that deals out its suspense in spades, supplying the intelligent story with an intensity that one-ups itself right up to the finale. This is one of those movies that requires your utmost attention to its many intricacies; if you're like me, you'll readily accept.<br />There's not much to talk about in terms of fresh ground: everything seen here has been done in one way or another in many other heist films. The story introduces us to Nick Wells (Robert De Niro), an expert in lifting valuable items who has had enough of the scoring business and wants out. But not before his partner in crime, Max __ (Marlon Brando), pulls out the old &quot;one last job&quot; cliché: this time, it involves sidestepping the high-tech security system of the Montreal Customhouse and lifting a precious scepter valued at thirty million dollars. <br />Nick is skeptical and hesitant about the job, especially after meeting Max's insider, Jack Teller (Edward Norton), whose ego tends to cloud his judgment once things get underway. Working as a night janitor under an assumed name and a mentally challenged demeanor, Jack supplies Nick with information vital to their success, from the location of surveillance cameras to the make and model of the safe that holds their goal. Meanwhile, on the outside, things begin to get murky, as Nick finds out the real reason for the heist, and Jack begins to lose sight of their plan. <br />To put it simply, this is an actor's movie, showcasing big-name talent in powerhouse ways. Take De Niro for instance, who starred in &quot;15 Minutes&quot; earlier this year as a New York City cop, and is now playing a criminal; two completely different characters, and yet he plays them as if they were one and the same. He may merely be playing De Niro, but he does it witha wit and presence all his own. Norton nails Jack to the wall, playing his egotistical attitude to sheer perfection while at the same time making us believe in Jack's knowledge of the facility's various areas. The film's other big-name stars, Brando and Angela Bassett, who plays Nick's girlfriend, make small appearances, but since so much of the central story focuses on De Niro and Norton's characters, it hardly matters. <br />The script, written by Kario Salem, Lem Dobbs and Scott Smith, is ingenious in the fact that it doesn't come off as an insult to the audience's intelligence. It's easily accessible to even the most clueless of moviegoers, allowing its logic to unfold in a manner that doesn't overload the mind. And with the exception of a few key points (why would a high-security facility allow access to its most vital areas to its janitors?), the plot comes through unscathed of logical pitfalls. <br />Anyone familiar with their heist and caper films will delight in pointing out the overused sequences and situations. The characters spend incredible amounts of time scoping the target, exchanging priceless lines of dialogue, gathering materials, all of which leads up to the big final act in which the actual heist will take place. But here's where &quot;The Score&quot; scores its points: it takes a well-known genre and whips it into shape with a heightened energy and intensity to match its smarts, building the suspense layer by layer as our characters get closer to attaining the scepter. <br />The third act of the film is the clincher, suspending us in time as we breathlessly await the outcome. In a certain way, we have to care for the characters, given the time and attention we have devoted to them as well as the story, which makes the film's final payoff a satisfying, if not totally original, conclusion. Looking past its reliance on familiarity, I think its safe to say that &quot;The Score&quot; is about three things: acting, energy, and smarts, and its meets these demands with supreme success.
B00000JZI9|3.0|Having rented the DVD from a local outlet, I was disappointed to behold an aspect ratio of 1:1.85 when I distinctly remember watching this great western on a super-wide screen at the theater AND believing the DVD package label which proclaimed it was presented in an aspect ratio of 1:2.35. <br />Someone tell me....has this movie been re-issued in its proper version?
B00003CXTG|1.0|Well, I tried watching this, I really did.  The attack footage is spectacular, the rest of the movie is such a waste.  When you have a list of people like this movie does that you just know can act (Affleck, Baldwin, Sizemore, and Gooding) and this is what you get out of it, I think it says something.  This movie says Michael Bey should stick to the movies where things blow up and he tells a buddy story and leave the romantic pieces to others.<br />I may be selling this short as I did use the skip ahead a number of times to try to get past the plastic romance, but the fact that I used it at all is telling.  If you want to see a good movie about Pearl Harbor, get the reissue of Tora! Tora! Tora!  The effects are dated (it's 30 years old after all) but a much better movie.
B00003CY0V|4.0|I enjoyed this movie about internet fraud at had all the action going on and it was a movie you didn't want to leave from in front of the t.v. John Travolato was great and his supporting cast was too.  A movie you have to have in your dvd collection I rented it and I must have it to watch again and again for the excitement.
0451160916|5.0|This very good book is about a man named Jack Torrance who takes a job as caretaker at the Overlook hotel. His son Danny has the ability to &quot;shine&quot; or ESP. Jack is a recovering alcoholic who also is trying to write a book at the hotel. About halfway through the book, Jack goes crazy and tries to kill his wife and son. But, his plans go horribly wrong. I would reccomend this to anyone who liked &quot;Carrie&quot; or &quot;Misery&quot;.
B000000OUE|4.0|I think that this CD is not as good as &quot;La Sexorcisto:Devil Music Vol.1&quot;. My reason is because of the industrial stuff and sampling. If the CD didn't have all the sampling and other industrial stuff it would be better. It does have some good songs though, like &quot;I,Zombie&quot; and &quot;El Phantasmo and the Chicken-Run Blast-O-Rama&quot;.
0060245867|5.0|If You Give A Mouse A Cookie is a funny and amusing little story. It is abtou how one little energetic mouse has so much fun in one day that he can not make up his mind what to do next. It tells how one littl thing can lead to a hol mess of fun things to do. It also has cause and effect throughout this enitre story. A litle mouse makes a boy get him a glass of milk and read to him and also make him a bed. But he never seemd to finish any thing he starts. This has been my favorite childrens book of all time. It also has cute pictures of what he is up to and great facil expresions. I would definetly recamend this.
0786860707|5.0|This amazing and exhaustivly detailed book describes the magic of the Disney art animation process from the 1920s to present day with many beautiful images of the world's most beloved cartoon characters. Thomas and Johnston were employed from the mid-1930s to 1978 in the Disney animation department and retired to create this book. Essential for anyone involved in animation or the graphic arts !!
B00005UQ9F|3.0|The movie follows a small group of hired absestos removers as they spend a week to remove absestos from a shut-down insane asylum, as things fall apart between the workers during the week. <br />The movie really is great at creeping you out and pushing your buttons.  In fact, the storytelling is done so well that it builds up the tension and makes you think that there's a major surprise in store, as you're wondering which one of the abestos removers is going crazy.<br />Sad to say, there isn't a major surprise.  The question isn't 'whodunnit?', but rather 'it can't be who I think it is, because that'd be waaayy too obvious and rather lame, but there's no other option', which makes the story rather predictable, and gets nowhere.<br />As long as you don't have any expectations, you'll enjoy the movie.
0790729652|4.0|Let's face it, the world needs superheroes, even if they're only in comic books or up on the silver screen.  And it's something everybody needs, though many won't admit it.  But if you've ever reached for a highball after a long day at work, or felt the blood drain from your face after seeing the latest figures from Wall Street, or even revisited in your dreams the days when you were so scrawny and little that beating you up was the sport virtually practiced at your school, you want a superhero.  Someone to avenge all the wrongs perpetrated upon you by the world and those in it.  Well, take a deep breath and relax, because salvation is at hand, via the magic of the movies, with \\"Batman,\\" directed by Tim Burton.<br /> Millionaire businessman Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) has a secret, as well as a secret identity; one born of the other.  His psyche scarred by a traumatic childhood experience, Wayne has devoted his life to fighting crime.  But more than that, to putting things aright; and he has the means, the ability and the wherewithal to do it.  Donning a black cape and mask when a situation arises, he becomes Batman, the quintessential avenger and rectifier of misdeeds.  And right now in Gotham City, his services are needed.  The entire city has fallen under the shadow of an evil man, the Joker (Jack Nicholson), whose tidal wave of criminal activity seems unstoppable.  Unabated, it may signal the end of the Gotham everyone knows and loves.  Their last and best line of defense is the man everyone knows and no one knows; the one the Joker is about meet face to face:  Batman.<br /> Lifting his hero from the pages of the comic books which spawned him, director Tim Burton has infused him with the breath of life, transforming him into a very real, three-dimensional character.  Pure fantasy?  Yes.  Escapism?  Absolutely.  Terrific entertainment, with perhaps a subtle message included?  You betcha!  Burton approaches the story from a very real perspective, rather than as merely a live version of a comic book character, and it works.  Splendidly.  It is, in fact, the difference between this being nothing more than a cartoon with \\"live\\" actors, and being a well crafted and delivered motion picture-- which is exactly what it is.<br /> Creating an atmosphere conducive to the realistic approach he takes, Burton grounds even the most fanciful elements of the film by steeping them in that same sense of reality.  The audience is called upon to suspend disbelief to a certain degree, of course, but Burton supplies all the tools you need to do it.  And those who use the tools he offers will be rewarded with a rich and riveting experience.  It's easy to scoff at an effort like this, and there will always be those who consider themselves \\"intellectually\\" above it, but such an attitude is nothing more than self-serving and indicative of an overblown ego and a decided lack of imagination.  To those individuals I would say:  Look for the metaphor; therein lies the message, enlightenment and maybe even a good time.<br /> A gifted actor with an innate penchant for comedy, Keaton left no doubt as to his versatility and his ability to do solid drama with the film \\"Clean and Sober.\\"  Here, he draws upon his considerable talents to create a character that is credible and believable, and he does it by playing to the man, rather than to the \\"bat.\\"  And it's the reason his stands as the definitive portrayal, miles ahead of the interpretations of those who followed him in the role in the sequels, Val Kilmer and George Clooney.  Accomplished actors, Kilmer and Clooney nevertheless failed to achieve the success Keaton enjoyed as Batman, and it's because they opted to play to the bat, rather than to the man, especially Clooney.  By directing their energies-- and the attention of the audience-- to the fantastic aspect of this two-sided character-- to the \\"bat\\"-- they compromised the integrity of the reality and lost that edge that made Keaton's portrayal so believable.  To put it another way, Keaton played him as a man whose extraordinary motivation and determination enabled him to accomplish extraordinary things; Kilmer and Clooney played him as a superhero who also just happened to be a man.<br /> Jack Nicholson gives a memorable performance as the Joker, creating a character whose extroverted, demonstrative nature plays well against Keaton's understated presentation of Batman.  It gives a sense of fire and ice to the film, tempered by Burton's atmospherically dark mood (which is established in the opening frames and continues throughout to the very end).  Nicholson, who generally plays his characters from a point of introspection, gets a chance to really open up and let loose as the Joker.  It's a role he seems to be having a good time with, while at the same time keeping it real and reflecting the vision that Burton realized with this film.<br /> The supporting cast includes Kim Basinger (Vicki Vale), Robert Wuhl (Alexander Knox), Pat Hingle (Commissioner Gordon), Billy Dee Williams (Harvey Dent), Michael Gough (Alfred), Jack Palance (Boss Grissom) and Jerry Hall (Alicia).  A film that works on a number of levels, which accounts for the universal appeal that made it so successful, \\"Batman\\" has an engaging, enduring quality that fulfills a need within us all; that need to vent and be sated in the righteousness of justice.  It can be enjoyed as simply a good guy versus bad guy movie, or in the deeper sense of Good versus Evil.  However you take it, it's a film that you'll appreciate more with each additional viewing.  Like a good wine, it gets better with age.ievable.  To put it another way, Keaton played him as a man whose extraordinary motivation and determination enabled him to accomplish extraordinary things; Kilmer and Clooney played him as a superhero who also just happened to be a man.<br /> Jack Nicholson gives a memorable performance as the Joker, creating a character whose extroverted, demonstrative nature plays well against Keaton's understated presentation of Batman.  It gives a sense of fire and ice to the film, tempered by Burton's atmospherically dark mood (which is established in the opening frames and continues throughout to the very end).  Nicholson, who generally plays his characters from a point of introspection, gets a chance to really open up and let loose as the Joker.  It's a role he seems to be having a good time with, while at the same time keeping it real and reflecting the vision that Burton realized with this film.<br /> The supporting cast includes Kim Basinger (Vicki Vale), Robert Wuhl (Alexander Knox), Pat Hingle (Commissioner Gordon), Billy Dee Williams (Harvey Dent), Michael Gough (Alfred), Jack Palance (Boss Grissom) and Jerry Hall (Alicia).  A film that works on a number of levels, which accounts for the universal appeal that made it so successful, \\"Batman\\" has an engaging, enduring quality that fulfills a need within us all; that need to vent and be sated in the righteousness of justice.  It can be enjoyed as simply a good guy versus bad guy movie, or in the deeper sense of Good versus Evil.  However you take it, it's a film that you'll appreciate more with each additional viewing.  Like a good wine, it gets better with age.
B00005OLY5|5.0|I went to see this movie when it came out in theaters so long ago.  Val Kilmer had me laughing when he knew how to swing a sword but tripped and fell after rolling into the snow. Also when he got hit with that love powder the brownies had and started spouting love poems to Sorcha instead of getting the baby. Oh, by the way, I loved the way the baby was able to cry on cue and give the right look at the right time.  I laughed when she got sick all over the know-it-all town counsel member who appointed himself leader. There was nothing worse then having to fight Bavmorda's army and the two-headed dragon that developed from the dying troll. If I were a kid that would have scared me. My sister told me that this scene scared a child so bad in the theater where she worked, that the family had to ask for a refund. I loved the fight scene between Razel Queen Bavmorda, especially when Razel used Dalindria's wand to make her spin and bounce off the castle walls.  I know this had to hurt.<br />This movie impressed me so much that I had to have the book itself and the other three that followed.  I highly recommend this movie to ages 9 and up but be cautious on the dragon scene if you take anyone younger.
0380729407|5.0|My children always loved the movie.  For children; have them watch the movie first, then have them read the book.  I gave my son, now 20, my signed copy by Ray Bradbury.  He found more joy in that than any video game I could have bought him.
0060278234|5.0|Garth Nix's fascinating world continues in this dark fantasy.  If you like fantasies, this book is an excellent choice.  I would not recommend reading this book if you have not read &quot;Sabriel&quot; first, as this is the sequel to it.  This book is about Lirael's discovery of her true destiny and her adventures will continue in the next book, Abhorsen.  Garth Nix writes about the made up country, the Old Kingdom which is full of Charter magic and originates with the creation of the Great Charter.  He also writes about dead creatures and death, and about necromancers and the forbidden Free Magic.  His books are about this dark world and are perfect for people who like reading fantasies and books about magic and death and adventures and dark secrets and mysteries.  This is a book for mature readers and is not like any other fantasies.  Garth Nix's books are not about carefree magic and wizards and dragons.  They are about powerful magic and dead things and ancient paths.  The world Garth Nix has created is quite unlike any other and so is the battle within it.  Most books deal with the battle between good and evil, but in Garth Nix's books, it is the much more complex battle between the living and the dead, between two kinds of magic.  Though his are the best books I have ever read, I would not recommend them for everyone.  Their appeal is more selective, and you have to understand and accept his style to truly appreciate his books.
0385505833|4.0|Pleasant story with decent writing.  No thinking needed to read this book, just sit back and enjoy the story.
B00005NG9Z|5.0|i already have the unplugged dvd and listened to it all summer.  i grabbed the music bank dvd in the store the moment i saw it.  it's a great dvd but i think if they put all the additional footages (amateur video shots) at the end or in speacial features that would be so great.  those video shots pretty much ruin the overall quality of the dvd in a way.  well all i need to to is skip those bad resolution tracks to move to the actual songs.  great dvd overall.
0440213525|1.0|It was a very disappointing novel.<BR>John Grisham should take writing courses.<BR>He is a horrible writer!
B00003CX8J|3.0|I disagree with those who say this movie remained faithful to the comics themselves... Particularly with the way the movie seemed to adjust the timeline--placing characters in the film when they shouldn't be, leaving out people that should be there based on the people they DID include, or making them appear at an age inappropriate to match the characters around them.  There were just a lot of things that didn't add up.  It WAS an ok movie, and it even had a bunch of fantastic scenes that really brought out the personality of the characters (like Wolverine's cage fight scene early in the movie)--but then there were other times when I thought the writing/acting didn't do the character justice at all... Rogue, for example, didn't quite come off as her usual self, nor did Magneto have enough of his cool, calculating charisma. Oh well.  It's a watcher, but not neccessarily a frequent re-watcher.
B00001NFCY|5.0|One of only about 2 CD's that I have liked in its entirety!
B000056K04|3.0|There comes a time in every artist's life when they feel the need to listen to a record label and produce the album that the label wants, not necessarily the album that the band wants.  Such was the case in &quot;Everyday.&quot;  Everyday is by no means a &quot;bad&quot; album, but for fans of the band who have come to expect a certain standard, it falls a bit short.<br />Dave himself explores the use of electric guitar on the album, with mixed results.  Boyd Tinsley, one of the things that makes DMB so different and refreshing than most bands currently putting out music, is largely downplayed.  Basically, it's an album that sounds very much like a pop album, which, thanks to Glen Ballard, it basically is.<br />There are high points on the album that will make any DMB fan's playlist.  &quot;The Space Between&quot; is a typical DMB ballad, hauntingly written, albeit overplayed by mainstream radio.  However, it is still a strong song.  &quot;When The World Ends&quot; would have also been a mainstream success had the tragic events of September 11th not happened, preventing a song that mentions armegeddeon and crumbling buildings from ever getting radio play.  &quot;If I had It All,&quot; &quot;What You Are,&quot; and &quot;Fool To Think&quot; are also songs to be easily enjoyed and played over and over.<br />Not all is well, however.  &quot;I Did It,&quot; the band's first commercial single, almost seems like an inside joke between the hardcore DMB fans and the band towards the mainstream.  Dave Matthews heartfelt and deep lyrics are nowhere to be found in this song, instead replaced by the &quot;bomb of love&quot; that is this song (his lyrics, not mine.)  &quot;Angel,&quot; although very pretty, seems like it was written during a card game, with metephor-a-plenty being used to describe his love with references to bluffing and &quot;keeping your hand close to your chest.&quot;  &quot;Mother Father&quot; is a beautifully written song that sounds like it's a 45 being played on 78.  It's basically a slow, dramatic song (think along the lines of &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; from 1995's Crash) with an uptempo beat that you can dance to.  You know how they take songs that weren't meant to be dance songs and &quot;remix&quot; them into &quot;club mixes&quot;?  That's what this sounds like.<br />I think the key for this album, however, is the title song, currently being played in radio play and on the music video outlets.  &quot;Everyday&quot; has a homey jam feel to it, which is what the Dave Matthews Band is really about.  It's the only song on the album where Dave picks up an acoustic guitar, and on top of all the mainstream pop, it sits on the bottom as a taste of what the Dave Matthews Band really is.  For those who pick up this album as their beginning DMB experience, pay close attention to that final track.  Your like or dislike of track twelve will pretty much determine if you should purchase future albums from the band (as Glen Ballard and his pop-making ways are reportedly out), or if &quot;Everyday&quot; should be your only venture into C-Ville.

B00005O3VC|5.0|As the details of this edition are given above and in other reviews, I'll be brief.<br />This edition is the equivalent of a &quot;Criterion&quot; collection release. If you prefered the Criterion &quot;Life of Brian&quot; or &quot;Time Bandits&quot; over the standard studio releases, then you're interested in more than just the film itself, and you definitely would appreciate all the extras that this release gives.<br />My favorite &quot;extra&quot; is the documentary of Terry Jones and Michael Palin, revisiting all the sites where the movie was filmed (just 1 castle for many; an old copper mine; the Castle Aaarrrgg which they never got to enter during the shooting).<br />As for technical difficulties, I occasionally had problems with the &quot;white rabbit&quot; locking the playback, but that was all. Everything else worked as advertised.<br />This is the definitive edition for this movie. Don't bother with the other.
B00005QDW5|3.0|When I got my copy of Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd one of the Discs was missing.  You know the one that contains all the songs that were left off this best of collection.  The track listing includes the following songs, not particularly in this order:  Mother, Young Lust, Run Like Hell, Brain Damage, Eclipse, Welcome to the Machine, Pigs, Pigs on the Wing (Full 8 Track Version), The Gunner's Dream, The Final Cut, Not Now John, On the Turning Away, Take it Back.  <br />Maybe what Floyd management have planned is a release of these songs, with the additions of some other obscure gems (Nile Song, Interstellar Overdrive), on a two disc Best of Volume 2, for sale next Christmas Time!  Because they couldn't obviously leave these songs out of a best of collection.  The Sound and Mixing on this collection is excellent, and I understand why they edited some of the selections to fit, (Except Marooned, which was cut in Half!).  I just hope they give the songs listed above the recognition they deserve in Volume Two.<br />P.S. how about a Pink Floyd Tour including Roger to support this collection.  I mean, they play with the same backing musicians anyway (John Carin, Andy Wallace).  The last time Floyd came around I had to take a Final Exam and Missed them.  Out of all the live concerts I have wanted to see in my life, they are the only band that I have not seen yet.  One More Tour, Come On Guys!!!!!!!!!!
B00005K9LN|4.0|British Steel is a classic Heavy Metal album from Metal's mid period. Judas Priest was the band that really bidged the gap between 70's doom laden metal and 80's Speed and heavier Metal...Iron Maiden/Metallica...etc.<br />Let's start with the albums strengths....<br />Early Speed Metal....Rapid Fire<BR>Metal Classics.......Metal Gods<BR>Hidden Gems..........The Rage/Steeler<BR>Heavy but up-beat tracks...You Don't have to be old to be wise<BR>Radio staples....Breakin the Law/Livin After Midnight.<br />At one time I was reluctent to re-visit this album becasue the Radio songs, along with the anthem UNITED seemed so over-played and dated.....however, the re-mastered preduction seems to breath new life into these tunes.<br />The down side is that the two &quot;Unreleased tracks&quot; are quite unremarkable...The live version of Grinder is pretty cool, but the track Red,White, and Blue is horrible....Also, I refrain from giving more than 4 stars, because if you are not a fan of the Heavy Metal of that period, this album is probably not for you.....However, if you love Priest and have never picked this up on CD or then definetly but the re-master over the original CD release, becasue the sound is far more crisp and heavy.....Priest,Priest,Priest,Priest!
B00002MZ12|3.0|When I first got this album, I loved it.  Now, two years later, I barely listen to it.  Why?  Because Alanis has managed to put out an uninspired live album with only a few bright spots.  I rarely listen to Alanis now, but that's because I love her music so much.  For me, when I do decide to listen to her, it's a treat because it reminds me of how much I love her music.  Anyway, MTV Unplugged does little for me.  I suppose most unplugged albums are like this because the 10,000 Maniacs release is also uninspired and at times boring (though I prefer it over this one any day).  No Pressure Over Cappuccino is an absolutely gorgeous song with some of Alanis's best lyrics yet.  That I Would Be Good also benefits from the acoustic arrangements, with lovely strings accompanying Alanis's passionate vocals.  The only problem with this song is Alanis's hideous flute playing.  I also like Uninvited, though it suffers a lot without the amazing guitar solo at the end.  I can't possibly give Alanis anything less than three stars and this record does deserve a passing rating, but avoid this if you love the 'harder' sound of Alanis Morissette.  Her new album, Under Rug Swept, is coming out in February 2002 and I can't wait for it.
B00005JKOV|4.0|Waking Life is a dense, difficult to digest, series of monologues that address the most profound, timeless questions: is there an afterlife? how do dreams relate to our lives? and of course, what is the meaning of life?  Instead of answering these questions directly, a variety of personalities are employed to offer different perspectives, helping the protaganist slowly develop his own philosophy while he begins to question the very nature of his existence.  <br />This film seems formally related most closely to 'Slacker,' an earlier Linklater film, but where the latter seems more like an amibitious student exercise, Waking Life is a complete, yet flawed, masterpiece.  Both films use the same basic formula of narrating through a sequence of disparate characters, as opposed to a using traditional plots and three-act formats.  At the end of Slacker, you are left with the feeling that it could just as well go on as it could end, that none of the details are particulatly necessary; essentially its a day in the life of someone in Texas.  At the end of Waking Life, you see the significance of (most of) all that precedes it.<br />The animation style at first made me a bit uneasy, but I adjusted quickly and it became apparent that it was an integral part of the 'dream-like' atmosphere of the film.  <br />The monologues are mostly quite heavy and referential, and difficult to fully digest.  At the end of the movie, I was completely exhausted, but I wanted to see it again so that I could try to pick up the bits that went over my head.
B00004SU5J|5.0|Tourist a lovely blend of infectious jazz and house rhythms equally perfect for background music or close listening. It features an array of instruments, from a swing-jazz muted trumpet, to a sax-flute, to the staple piano. These instruments are complemented by a great blend of percussion and persistent rhythm, the sort present in techno/house music. <br />     The great thing about this album is that it improves with each successive listening. The opening track, 'Rose Rouge', is so subtle and multi-layered that it can literally be played over and over again. 'So Flute' has a magnificent, frenetic opening featuring things I never thought possible with a flute (I mean musically, not ala American Pie), and then it seamlessly blends into a lengthy cocktail piano solo. With each song spanning an average of about six minutes, it's typical for them to undergo numerous stages characterised by different instruments and beats. Hence Tourist's appeal: it is a marvellously diverse and entertaining listening experience.
B00000GAIW|5.0|I remember the day well...I was on a group tour of the Northeastern U.S. during the summer of 1984 (13 years after the release of this album) with a bunch of other teenagers when my friend Ned started talking about this amazing group, Jethro Tull, whose lead instrumentalist and ringleader was a flautist.  Hmmm...sounded interesting, but I was not prepared for the musical adventure I was about to embark on.<br />The album he had me listen to was this Aqualung album.  Two things struck me about this album initially.  The first was that this album just flat out rocked out, if you get my drift.  At the same time, the heavy numbers were extremely well tempered by incredibly beautiful, soft, acoustic gems that were peppered throughout the album.  It was also kind of nice to find out who was behind that famous &quot;Aqualung&quot; riff - I think everyone had heard that coming from some radio or another as they grew up in the '70s or even the early '80s (especially if family members listened to classic rock stations), but to those who were musically uneducated at the time (such as myself) it was quite a revelation...But I digress...<br />Not only was this an awesome example of amazing musicality within a rock context, it was a very interesting message that the lyrics presented...and that centers on the idea that religion, as an idea and the ideas presented in religion (at least in the Christian context, in the case of this album) are good things, but they get corrupted by the institutions that propagate religion...The album struck a chord with being in tune with my personal philosophy...<br />Favorite songs include (among those that really rock) - &quot;Aqualung&quot;, &quot;Cross-eyed Mary&quot;, &quot;My God&quot;, &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot; and &quot;Wind-Up&quot;.  Favorite songs (acoustic gems) include - &quot;Cheap Day Return&quot;, &quot;Slipstream&quot; and the Renaissance fair styled song &quot;Mother Goose&quot;.<br />To sum up:  Ian Anderson writes amazing songs on this album - I don't think there's a bad one in the bunch.  He plays a great flute (although he's actually gotten much better over time) and a terrific acoustic guitar.  The other musicians in the band are in top form - Martin Barre (lead guitar) plays with fire; John Evan (piano) plays wonderfully throughout as does the drummer Clive Bunker and the bassist Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond.  This album is one of the highlights in Jethro Tull's storied history, providing an ominous toned album with a serious religious theme, but making it absolutely delicious to listen to at the same time, and therefore highly accessible.  I highly recommend this album...another in the category of ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO ANY SERIOUS ROCK MUSIC COLLECTOR!!!
B00005QDW1|5.0|'Rock Steady' is No Doubt's best effort since 'Tragic Kingdom'. Starting with 'Hella Good', 'Rock Steady' returns to No Doubt's ska roots, while adding both rock and reggae grooves to the mix. In a sentence, this CD really is 'Hella Good'.
B00005QW5X|5.0|The First reviewer covered it all. <BR>A film that will live with you for a long, long time.<BR>Beautiful, funny, fantastic music, an incredible realized herione/hero and a narrative line that touches the soul. If Mitchell doesn't get at least an Oscar nod for his performance then it is abundantly clear that the Hollywood powers that be wouldn't know true Art if it you-know-what -- on their face! I could go on forever but its all been said. Just see it.<BR>Thank you John Cameron Mitchell for creating Hedwig.
6301978587|5.0|I'm very picky, disliking most musicals, but this is one of the best i've ever seen.  I think that the critics were wrong about it (maybe they just didn't GET IT).  It's a great story with great drama and well integrated music which is nearly impossible to do.
0385505833|4.0|There is no mystery in this book.  What I liked about it was the fact that I could relate to it.  I'm sure a lot of you out there would have liked to skip Christmas at some time.  I know that I would.  The expense, hassle, and everything that goes with it can get you down.  I've always heard that people get depressed at Christmas.  I am sure the reason for the depression is because they took a look at their checkbook balance.  We all seem to over spend, I know that I do, but I tell myself every year that Christmas comes but once a year.
630588255X|4.0|This movie is beautiful. It affected me for more than just 20 minutes after I had watched it, which is really saying something, I think.  I loved the very end.  A banjo?!  I shook with laughter as tears streamed down my face.
0385505833|4.0|Grisham's latest (and possibly smallest) novel &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; offers a new approach to the season: Scrooge it. Luther, the main character, decides that since his daughter has joined the Peace Corps, he will skip the holiday and go on a cruise with his wife. What follows are weeks of satire, ostracism and disappointment.<br /> Though written by typical Grisham standards, the book fails to deliver somehow. I just don't feel the effort in this book that I  felt in &quot;A Painted House&quot; or &quot;A Time to Kill,&quot; because it is so short. There is no research on the author's part to further back the time period. Despite that, I like the idea of, instead of tauting Christmas as the hap-happiest time of the year, displaying it as a money-maker that leaves you with a sea of people all holding their hands out. A bit of a disappointing ending, but you smile nontheless.
B00003CX8U|5.0|It's self indulgent, obsessive, strange... and all the better for it. It still amazes me that such a personal film managed to win 4 Oscars, it's the sort of thing the Academy usually ignores. Just watch the opening &quot;cattle call&quot; audition to see how it got its editing Oscar. The 5th award it should have got: best actor. This is the performance of a lifetime from Roy Scheider. A must for Fosse fans (but we all know that): it could be a struggle for those with little interest in musical theatre.<br />(Review based on VHS, which is wearing out waiting for DVD)
B00000K2SC|5.0|My Favorite Movie!<br /> -awesome special effects<br /> -action packed!<br /> -okay, the acting isn't so great...<br /> -mind-boggling (but interesting) plot!<BR> <BR> -don't be fooled by the &quot;R&quot; rating, its not that violent...<br />    The Matrix is a classic when it comes to Sci-Fi action movies. Action-packed with interesting characters and plot, and if you like the movie as much as me you'll get the awesome soundtrack!!!
B00004UFYU|3.0|My goodness...What happened to the Electric guitar solos that gave a music such a unique dimention? Where are the great haunting melodies and sorrowfull lyrics ? It's just too bad that the second disc was not such a masterpiece as ERA 1. <BR>An obvious downfall....
B00005O3VC|5.0|This new DVD of Monty Python &amp; The Holy Grail is excellent.  Aside from the movie itself, there's excellent audio commentary by all the surviving Pythons.   The second disc really makes this new version superior to the previous DVD.  The on-location documentary is good, but even better is the &quot;Quest For the Holy Grail Locations&quot; with Palin &amp; Jones.  It's remarkable how much footage was shot in a single castle (it's only a model...).  My only disappointment was that the Japanese dub is only two short scenes.  It's very funny to see the dialogue reworked, and I wish they'd showed the whole film with the dubbing.  No matter, the rest is excellent, and with a Lego rendition of &quot;Knights Of The Round Table&quot; into the bargain, it's a must have for all silly persons.
B000002KO3|5.0|Excellent. Just buy it. If you appreciate originality, you'll like it. For full effect, listen loud and sing along. Perfect music for late night driving.<br />&quot;The Listening Wind&quot; is very current indeed ! - It's all you need to know about the current Middle East Situation. Listen to the last cuts first. And no, I never use the word &quot;indeed&quot; in actual conversation.
B00005LB9O|1.0|I really loved The Man Who, and even though i wanted to think this album was as goos as TMW, i knew it wasn't true, even before i opened it. it actually took me a week to get up the courage to listen to it, because i was absoloutely terrified it would not be as good as the first. when i finally listened to it, i felt like crying. THIS IS THE DEMISE OF TRAVIS.The album has two good songs. &quot;Sing&quot; and &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot;. how is it possible that they went from being an amazing band making the perfect album with 10 perfect songs (+ a killer bonus track) to being a one hit wonder-album type band. it makes me really sad. do yourself a favor and buy The Man Who
B000001DVD|5.0|This 'raw' CD of the Lep is their finest - before being glossed into a commercial heavy metal machine.  Mind you, I love Pyromainia and Hysteria, but that is about it...  This CD captures all of their early raw energy; combined with 'On through the Night', this is Lep's finest moment - and the Vault CD totally dismissed most of this and their debut!<br />This album was a permanent fixture in my first car (as a tape, of course), and I never tired of the sheer energy that was on 'High and Dry' - in fact, I only wished that other bands would follow suit!  'Let it Go' and 'Another Hit and Run' still make me long for that kind of stuff today. (...) This CD was good old 'feeling good' rock and roll with a heavy induction of pep and guitars by the Lep.<br />Lep fans - this is a MUST - for all others, you must check this out keeping in mind that this is good old 70's hard rock, not the Lep stuff that followed...
078322334X|4.0|While it's not as good as the first movie, it's a hell of allot better than Part 3. Jeff Goldblum is great as Ian Malcolm( Unlike Sam Nell, who embarrasses himself and the series with his performance in Jurassic Park 3) and The movie  is up to snuff with the legacy of the original, Unlike Jurassic Park 3. If you want to be entertain, then The Lost World Is your Film.
B000001GPX|5.0|This was the first classical CD I ever owned, and it's still one of my favorites.  Intense, romantic, yet under-control and gorgeous recordings of two incredible pieces of music.  <br />If you enjoy Beethoven and don't have this CD I'd buy it right away.  While for some of Beethoven's symphonies I've gone off and bought several recordings (I have _10_ of the 9th since I've never found one that I'm completely satisfied with), I've never felt the need to get additional recordings of the 5th or 7th because these are so good. <br />It'd also be a good choice for someone just starting to get interested in classical music, it sure worked for me.
6304196784|5.0|What makes this special is the interplay between American and English attitudes that is at its heart. This is a pet area of co-writer and star Cleese who has had three American wives and nurtures a fascination for the differences between the two cultures. This can be seen both in his work with Monty Python and in the Fawlty Towers episode The Americans. The conflict created between the characters' backgrounds creates much of the magic and gives the picture its transatlantic appeal. Cleese gives a career best performance as an actor, being surprisingly vulnerable in the love scenes and making us believe that he has fallen in love with Jamie Lee Curtis. Kline won an deserved Oscar for his very very funny supporting role, but all four stars contribute equally to this post-modern Ealing comedy. This leads me to mention Charles Crichton who co-directed with Cleese. In his last feature film, Crichton was in his late seventies when this was made. Having directed classic Ealing comedies The Titfield Thunderbolt and The Lavender Hill Mob, Crichton had retired from feature films in the 1960s and since then had turned in many well received episodes of television series such as The Avengers and The Professionals. His return to feature films marked a return to the form which had made him so successful in his Ealing days, garnering him commercial success and his only Oscar nomination.

Kline won an deserved Oscar for his very very funny supporting role, but all four stars contribute equally to this post-modern Ealing comedy. This leads me to mention director Charles Crichton. In his last feature film, Crichton was in his late seventies when this was made. Having directed classic Ealing comedies The Titfield Thunderbolt and The Lavender Hill Mob, Crichton had retired from feature films in the 1960s and since then had turned in many well received episodes of television series such as The Avengers and The Professionals. His return to feature films marked a return to the form which had made him so successful in his Ealing days, garnering him commercial success and his only Oscar nomination.
B000002LE6|4.0|Don't get me wrong -- I love Prince. I mean, I was 14 when Purple Rain rocked the free world and VERY susceptible to good music. I've been a fan a long, long time.<br />So why not the usual five stars for a classic Prince album?  Do the math. James Brown + Sly &amp; The Family Stone/Jimi Hendrix = Prince.<br />This album, however, is JUST Prince doing James Brown. He left out the other two parts of the equation. It's still good. It's still funky. It's still seriously danceable, even for a seriously white boy like me. It just isn't Prince at his best.<br />But you should still buy it, if only for the groove (and wonderfully cleanly dirty lyrics!) on Alphabet Street.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|The three great Judy Garland masterpieces - 'The Wizard of Oz', 'Meet me in St. Louis' and 'A Star is Born' - are so precious because they deal with the idea of 'Home', one far more important than anything as trivial as love and death.  In these films, the tension, the poignancy, the angst arises from two impossible desires - to escape home, to assert one's own identity, to achieve space and privacy; and the terror of losing home, security, one's 'place'.  <br />'Louis' dramatises this with an amazing intensity, and should rightly be called a tragicomedy.  The film is concerned with female space, rarely leaving the home; a space defined by an often absent Father who nevertheless determines actions with the power of a God (or Santa Claus): in group compositions, he is usually to be found on a higher level to the women, looking down on them.  <br />From the outset, this domestic space is recognised as a prison: one of the first images we see are the 'bars' of the staircase; Esther's first dress (in a film where costumes are vital emotional signifiers) is striped like a convict's uniform; the recurring visual motif is of female characters, especially Esther, framed, in doorways, mirrors, and especially windows, looking out on a life they cannot join.  This emphasis on female confinesment, on life restricted to interior spaces, anticpates the great melodramas of the 1950s, of which director Minnelli himself was to become a master.  'Louis' is credited as a milestone in musical history because it is the first film to integrate the songs into the emotional lives of the characters, rather than simply as show-stopping extravaganzas (what about 'Show Boat', though?).  In music, characters can express what must be withheld in real life (heightened in this film by the colour, choreography, lighting, and Minnelli's 'commentary' in his compositions, such as the statue overlooking the piano as Esther and Rose sing).  <br />Paradoxically, this confinement does offer a lot of freedom, a space where the women can control their activities away from the male gaze.  The other recurrent motif in the film is theatre, putting on shows, costumes and identities, pretending, playing ruses.  This element of performance, of course, shows how the 'natural' unit of the family is actually a construct; but, more positively, it allows the girls to try out different roles and possibilities before the inevitable one of marriage - it also creates the atmosphere for magical transforations, such as an old man turning into a young beau behind a Christmas tree.  After all, the father here is no domineering monster - his sense of frustration at being tied down to the family, his talent and capabilities being thwarted or underused, is beautifully done, hinting at the crises in masculinity Minnelli would later explore in classics like 'Some Came Running'.<br />'Louis' is a deliberately nostalgic film, looking back in the middle of an apocalyptic war to turn-of-the-century Americana.  But this period in the film is also a time of modernity, of new inventions, new modes of transport, and the World Fair itself.  The unchanging way of life of the Smiths is already in danger, while the comparative freedom of the youngest daughters hint at changes to come.  The film is structured around seasonal set-pieces, asserting continuity, but these seasons, such as Halloween, are also breaks from the norm, where the fragility of the family is acknowledged, with the many references to Death and spinsterhood.  <br />The Smiths are such a wonderful, funny, loving, intelligent, resourceful family, that the various crises, literal and latent, thrown their way, makes the film all the more emotionally upsetting, reaching a shocking climax with the snowman decapitation (although the earlier scene in which Tootie trick-or-treats the emotionally dead couple with the dog, is a nightmare vision of another kind of family life, crowned by a terrifying tracking shot).  If only all families could belike the Smiths.  Among an astonishing cast, Judy Garland is quite simply sublime - yearning, tragic, amused, and, in the fisticuffs porch scenes with Tom Drake, radiantly erotic.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|I watched these DVDs right through in one sitting - all 4 hours. These characters are REAL. I have met all of them several times over in the course of the past 15 years or so. These characters aren't offensive stereotypes, as some people have noted. You can see them prowling around every gay bar around, or sitting quietly in the corner of the cocktail bar upstairs. The dialogue is fabulous - its great to see writing that knows its intended audience has a brain, and treats them like adults. And of course, the acting is first-rate, with believable sex scenes that are there for a purpose, not just for the 'cheap thrill'.

B000059TPN|5.0|this is one pristine DVD! the picture is crystal-clear, the audio ROCKs, the extras are fully loaded.<br />believe, it won't get any better. buy this, you won't regret it!
0780622650|5.0|I was a big fan of the original Lost in Space television series. That TV Show will forever be a childhood icon of mine. So of course I was anxious to see the Movie version.I was very dissappointed with the movie version. (a) The story line was very complicated and difficult to comprehend and follow (b) The chemistry of the cast was NO WAY CLOSE TO THAT OF THE ORIGINAL CAST. The original cast were definitely born to play their roles in the TV Series--They were made for it!!! Unfortunately the cast of the movie version were very generic--they could of just been picked from a group of people at the mall that needed work. The Will boy looked like some random kid they found at some playground. I guess the best words to describe the movie cast is WOODEN and NO-CHEMISTRY.Every single person in the cast was a definite MIS-CAST...That new Doctor Smith was so far-off from the original Dr. Smith. John Robinson was WOODEN and unconvincing. Maureen lacked the motherly &quot;Brady Bunch-like&quot; charm and appeal. Lacey was TOO HOT for the Penney role (More on that later!), the New Don was too macho for his role, Judy was passable since she never had a big role in the tv series anyway. And Will was just too common and generic, any playground kid could of filled his shoes for that role.(c) I disliked the DARK MELODRAMATIC tone of the movie. The original series was light, bouncy, and fun!HOWEVER, I in 100% complete seriousness give this movie FIVE (5) STARS!!!This movie earns 5 stars because:(a) In addition to being a fan of the Lost in Space TV series, and even Science Fiction in general....I am a really big fan of hot young girls in movies.(b) Lacey Chabert who played &quot;Penney&quot; was just so unbelievably hot!!! I was totally captivated by the sound of her voice--it was such a unique style. I loved the way she looked in that tight mini-skirt and all the space-age fashions she wore in the movie. Her face was so cute and adorable. Her hair was so sexy the way it was black and stringy. She looked awesome in the tight space suit. She had such an incredible sexy demeanor about her. My favorite shots of her, were the close-ups when she was recording in her portable video diary. WOW!!! She looked so totally kissable to the extreme!!!The first time she appeared in the movie, I was under her spell and KNEW THAT I WOULD HAVE TO BUY THE DVD AS SOON AS IT CAME OUT!!!! I definitely wanted a copy of HER on DVD to watch over and over!!!(c) Since I already own both LOLITA movies (B&amp;W and Color versions), and BEAU-PERE....This Lost in Space movie with Lacey Chabert was a MUST HAVE! If it was not for Lacey Chabert, I would of rated the movie THREE (3) STARS!But since personal movie ratings are based upon PERSONAL tastes, and NOT the collective tastes of a group of people, I give the movie 5 stars since I am such a big fan of cute young movie actresses and LACEY CHABERT most certaintly was 90% of the reason I gladly paid for the DVD----and 100% of the reason I went to see Lost In Space at the movie theater 6 times!!!
B000002C1W|3.0|i am not a pink floyd expert, which i feel allows me to write a review that is impartial and unbiased.  i dont give a flying monkey who was in the band when what album was made.  my overall opinion of this one is that it is a decent cd, not good or bad.  I like it for &quot;on the turning away&quot; which i greatly enjoy, as well as the funky &quot;a new machine, Part I and II&quot;.  the rest of the cd is indifferent, i feel that some of the introductions are pretty long and boring and some others are weird in a negative way.  i borrowed this cd from a friend, and personally would not purchase it.
B000000W5N|5.0|As far as I'm concerned this is the last really good release the stones had. Mick Taylor was fantastic... but was booted not soon after. The material was solid, has stood the test of time and continues to enjoy airplay. Unlike just about every release since.
B00005QDW1|3.0|Gwen and company shed their SoCal Punk-Ska roots on their new release \\"Rock Steady\\", to come up with something more decidedly Reggae. But more effective than this addition, is the outrageous (and logical) choice to retro-sample the 80's New Wave sound into their own. Old style keyboards reminiscent of Devo, The Cars, and Flock of Seagulls, blip and bump along fat chunks of vibrating bass. The result is less confessional than their fine predecessor \\"Return of Saturn\\", but it's also more fun. The singles really crack and pop when No Doubt team up with producer Nellee Hooper in the excellent \\"Hella Good\\", \\"Detective\\", and \\"Rock Steady\\"... \\"Rock Steady\\" marks another creative growth spurt for No Doubt, but if you get it for that reason alone, then you've missed the invitation to the House Party.
B00003CXXS|5.0|I'm scratching my head reading the reviews commenting on the lack of plot and so-so acting. C'mon now! The JP franchise is about dinosaurs running around chasing people and eating them.  It is the perfect B movie formula and this movie delivers. The dinosaurs (the real stars of the movie) are simply amazing to watch. The DVD is loaded with extra features and there is coupon to receive a free DVD of your choice among a healthy list to choose from. So if you want to see Laura Dern &quot;act&quot; in a movie with a &quot;plot&quot; then choose October Sky from the list of choices. The JP III DVD is an excellent value for the money.

630157401X|5.0|In this the 3rd of the Indiana Jones trilogy, we again meet Indy(Ford) back at the university, when he recieves a strange notebook in the mail from his father(Connery), and he is contacted by the dubious buisnessman Walter Donovan(Glover), he decides to go to Venice, Italy to find his disapeared father along with his confused friend Marcus Brody(Elliot). Here he meets his fathers associated Dr. Elsa Schneider(Doody), as they delver further in to the mystery of his fathers disapearance and the Holy Grail, they find that they are opposed by several groups, and once again Indiana Jones finds himself battling nazis as he tries to get to the grail before them, and in the process getting Adolf Hitlers autograph(even though Adolf seem to misspell his name in the movie). The movie reminds alot of the mood that was created in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Connery is perfect in the role as Henry Jones, sr. and the whole movie seems to be in perfect balance keeping you at the edge of your seat all the time, but still giving you time to calm down.
0553573403|5.0|I can understand why people don't like these books.  Oh my gosh, are they graphic.  Women are raped constantly, men are tortured without mercy, the innocent are put to the sword, and the bad guys seem to always win.  And do you know what?  Its totally awesome.  Yes, you're lulled into thinking that the Starks will win eventually, and you're baited into thinking that it'll be like all the other fantasy that you've read where you're taken to the point of defeat and - behold...from the sky...a harbinger of hope has arrived!  But it doesn't happen.  And that's what makes it so great.  You're fooled, and you'll hate it, but you won't stop reading it.<br />Regardless, even though Martin is not sentimental about his characters (although you may be, sheep that you are), there remains the hope that everything will be okay, so you keep reading.  Don't be fooled by other reviews. Not that many major characters get killed here, 2 at the most.  You'll get over it and love it.<br />You'll only not like it if you're offended by graphic violence and swear words.  And if you are, please read Harry Potter.  I hear he always comes out on top, his friends never die, and the magic of love prevails always.  The rest of us will revel in the sweet subtely of Martin's writing.<br />And let's not forget The Imp.  Always The Imp.
6300214435|4.0|In the 1984 followup to Raiders of the Lost Ark we find Indiana Jones once again out on adventure. This time he makes a deal with the dubious buisnessman Lao Che(Chiao) and shortly there after we find Dr. Jones fighting off henchmen all the while he is trying to find an antidote for a poison. He is, somewhat against his will forced to join up with entertainer Willie Scott(Kate Capshaw), and toghether with his small companion Short Round(Quan) they escape the vicious Lao Che.<BR>The movie seems much darker and more brooding than Raiders of the Lost Ark, and is marred by a feeling that it have to \\"outdo\\" the original what effects are considered. The cliffhanger style is still intact though and Indiana Jones still knows how to handle himself in any situation(almost). It might be a bit confusing to some that this movie is set 10 years before Raiders of the Lost Ark. The plot is not as good as Raiders... and the heroine is not as cool, but it still comes out as a great and entertaining movie.
B000006YBO|5.0|NOLA received about, oh I'd say 12,000 rotations through my CD player all the way through since 1996.  There's a beautiful simplicty to this CD and it all begins with guitar riffs.  Today's &quot;metal&quot; is surprisingly void of the main guitar riff which is blasephemy. To me, that is what makes heavy metal...well, metal.  Cluttered by boring, detuned guitar sludge with growls over it, today's metal scene is just plain watered down and uninspired. You could probably count about 3-6 classic riffs on a given Down song (minus &quot;Jail&quot; but that's another story).  Every riff screams &quot;I'm heavy, I know it, and its a shame that other bands can't even come remotely close to smoking me.&quot; Just slow and deliberate hazy (and catchy) guitars, exactly the way it should be. Naming specific songs which are good is pointless because they ALL are (the riffs in &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot; comes immediately to mind.) &quot;Blues&quot; rock is given an entirely new meaning with every song. Guitars aside, Phil's vocals are full of soul. You really get to hear a second side to him apart from his Pantera style. You do get a nice serving of his screams though. It's almost as if he's schizophrenic on the album. He'll sing this pretty and mellow vocal line, and then back it right up with his trademarked &quot;hotter than Satan&quot; shrieks (see &quot;Rehab&quot;). Also, check out the impressive vocal effects on &quot;Hail the Leaf&quot;, they're worth the price of admission alone. &quot;Jail&quot; is a song that caught me completely off guard.  No distorted guitars, just an acoustic with bongos and Phil singing tripped out lyrics to a prettier than pretty song, a must hear. As with most great albums, you will not be able to swallow every nuance on Nola in one sitting. Forget it. The record is so dense that it will take at least 20 listens to get the big picture.  And when you see it, I guarantee you'll have a huge blacktooth grin on your face.  This is not Metallica,this is not Slayer, its not Pantera.  It is its own entity, heading in a direction that only it can go in.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon is truly on of those albums that make any rock collection incomplete if it is not included. Over time, this recording has proven to be even more important and relevant today than when it first came out. The record broke new gound in the way it was recorded, the way it was design and the way it was marketed ever since. CD technology has increased this record reputation as it has made it more evident how far ahead was everybody involved ith its conception back in 1972-73. This recording promises many more years of listening pleasure and musical discoveries.  <br />What amazes me about this recording is that everytime I give it a new listening I discover new sounds and meanings to the songs. This is a record that evolves with each individual listener.
B00008972S|3.0|Created by composer Leonard Bernstein, lyricist Stephen Sondheim, writer Arthur Laurents, and director-choreographer Jerome Robbins, WEST SIDE STORY blew Broadway audiences away with its startling mixture of gritty dance, Latin and jazz-based score, and updating of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET to the mean streets of 1950s New York. But like many another Broadway musical both before and after, the film version leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />To do justice to the film, the flaws in WEST SIDE STORY were probably not apparent to either creators or audiences at the time it debuted in 1961. By and large, the 1950s and 1960s were tough on the musical, and those who worked in the genre struggled to move it from the frothy confections of the 1940s into something more relevant to contemporary audiences that favored an often noir-ish realism. With its tale of warring gangs and interracial romance, WEST SIDE STORY seemed tailor-made for the new trend--but in making the movie the producers and directors repeatedly feel back on &#34;old style musical&#34; techniques in terms of cinematography and staging. Seen today, these tend to undercut the movie's overall impact.<br /><br />The first fifteen minutes or so of the film are arguably its best: a dance sequence that shows the clash of the rival gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, filmed on location in New York and capturing some of the best choreography ever put upon the screen. But once the ballet ends, the look of the film becomes remarkably stagey, the bulk of the scenes very obviously shot on sound stages and clashing with the style and tone of portions shot on location. The stylistic shift is very noticeable and it gives WEST SIDE STORY a clumsy quality. That said, however, the dance sequences are stunning, the score can still run chills up your spine, and the cast--although not always ideal--ranges from exceptional to at minimum rock solid.<br /><br />In truth, neither Richard Beymer nor Natalie Wood are ideal for the leading roles of the star-crossed lovers--indeed the selection of Wood, who was not really a singer, was extremely controversial--but both give artful performances and (Wood in particular) are successful in bringing it off. But the real winners here are in the supporting cast: Russ Tamblyn as Riff, leader of the Jets; George Chakiris as Bernardo, leader of the Sharks; and Rita Moreno as Anita, Bernardo's girl--and an incredible dance ensemble that simply explodes across the screen with tremendous grace and power. And that music! It pulses, drives, writhes like a living thing. Taken as a whole, these elements outweigh the film's annoying flaws.<br /><br />The Special Edition Collector's Set will please most fans of the film; the bonus features are quite nice, and fans will have the opportunity to judge for themselves whether or not it was necessary to dub Natalie Wood's vocals with the ubiquitious Marnie Nixon. Although this clearly not &#34;the perfect musical&#34; every one thought it to be at the time, WEST SIDE STORY is still a knock-out, as unexpected today as it was when it first roared onto the Great White Way.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerhe leading roles of the star-crossed lovers--indeed the selection of Wood, who was not really a singer, was extremely controversial--but both give artful performances and (Wood in particular) are successful in bringing it off.

B000002J09|5.0|Its been 30 years since the release of one of the most important documents in hard rock history. Led Zeppelin iV represented a turning point in Led Zeppelin career as a rock band. After three succesful albums the band decided let the music do all the talking to the point of releasing the album without any obvious indication on the cover art about the band or the album title. This recording cover al bases of the Led Zeppeling ground: The hard rock of Black Dog &amp; Rock &amp; Roll, The folk sounds of the Battle of Evermore and Going to Cailfornia and the Epci sound of Stairway to Heaven. Every Led Zeppelin record is essential to the complete understanding of hard rock but this would be the the one that made them legends.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Even the drug warriors have something to lose in the drug war. That's the overshadowing message I've seen in this movie each time I've seen it. It's a great flick, and it carries at least a handful of powerful messages. No matter your feelings about the drug war, there's some part of this movie that will change them. Some may complain about the artsy feel of it in points, but I think that makes the movie all the more desirable.

Occasionally dull and more often than not disjointed, the musical sequences save the day, and you won't see a performance of &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot; anywhere else.  Film seems to hold up much better today in the age of music videos and as a landmark of 1960's psychadelia.  Beatle fans and 1960's buffs are sure to enjoy this more than a casual viewer.
0784011796|5.0|This movie gives me chills. It's creepy. There isn't much of a message to it, to say nothing of a serious plot... It's sort of a modern B movie. Like a PCP-induced Plan 9 from Outer Space, it's peculariarity makes it difficult to turn away from, and the electronic soundtrack and gritty black and white feel just add so much more to the viewer's perception of the characters and the flick as a whole. It's great.
052594527X|3.0|This is the first book I have read by Chevalier. I didn't love it, but I'm glad I read it.<br />Parts of it were very good, such as the description of what life was like in the 17th century, how things were done, how life was seen through a painter's eyes, how families lived, etc...<br />Others were dull and tedious to read, but I won't go into that.<br />The main character, Griet, is a 16 year old girl, who is &quot;forced&quot; to work as a maid for Vermeer, a very famous painter. She is very bright, and she has the ability to know exactly what everyone thinks about her, feel when someone is behind her and  when she is being looked at, know exactly what people want from her, and even make changes that make paintings perfect, which makes her very unbelievable, but, apart from that, she is likable and you do find yourself in her shoes from time to time.<br />The storyline is simple, not very elaborate, and the characters are either pure white or  midnight black. <br />The story is definetly fiction, yes, it is based on a true painting, and on the life of the artist who painted it, but so little is known about the painter's life that Chevalier really let her imagination flow when it came to the feelings and attitudes of all the characters.<br />Finally, if you really want to read this, you will enjoy it, if you don't have very high expectations, and it is a simple easy read for a relaxed afternoon with a nice cup of coffee!

0780624890|5.0|This is one of the best Vampire movies I have seen in a long time.  Wesley Snipes looks like he was born to play this role.  The fight scenes in this movie are unreal.  The plot is very easy to follow and it makes sense.  Stephen Dorff also does a great job as Frost.  The DVD also is excellent, it has good features and good directors commentary that are actually worth WATCHING.  Picture and audio is great, newline always does good with their DVD's.  Watch fo Blade 2 coming in March, word is it will be a lot more violent and bloody than the first film: I can't wait to see it!
630512762X|5.0|John woo is an action cinematographer par excellence. Be it his slow motion double fisted gun shot scenes, or the breath taking stunts and action choreography, you have it all here. Couple this with absolutely classy acting from the GOD of style John Travolta and Nicolas Cage, you have FACE-OFF. The action is just perfect and simmers in with the drama unfolding along side. The core concept of the movie of swapping faces might sound absurd, but the rest is art of action cinematography. <br />A must see for all action and John Woo fans.<br />The DVD is not packed with anything extra, it just has subtitles and Audio modes. I wish they had put in some extra behind the scene stuff would have been great.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I get tired of everyone complaining &quot;Well, it was good until they had to slap the happy ending on.&quot; It isn't happy. If it had ended with him on the bottom of the ocean, yes. That would have been poignant and a great ending, but it continued so we have the actual ending, David living one perfect day with his mom. Sounds happy, right? It does, until you think of this- with him on the bottom of the ocean, there was hope for him to get his wish. Time didn't mean anything and he didn't know any better. With the actual ending, everything's over. He has no hope for the future. He had one day with her, and that's all he'll ever have, so he'll live forever knowing what he had but could never have again.
6303187064|5.0|When I found out that this was considered an action movie, I was a little iffy on weather or not to see it. However, I did, and I'm very glad I decided to--this is an AWESOME movie!! All the fans of it say it over and over: this movie has EVERYTHING. Action, romance, passion, depth...a hot and sexy male lead... Indeed, Brandon Lee's preformance throughout the film was exceedingly worthy, and it's almost painful to relfect on how it was on the very set of this fabulous movie that his life ended. [*sniffle* I would have been a die-hard fan of his if I had watched any of his movies while he was alive.] Anyway, the movie's feel is deliciously dark and it gives a real feel for the whole story. Top Dollar makes for a pretty good bad guy, too, and I actually LIKED Sarah, unlike most of her &quot;type&quot; of characters. Also worthy of mention is the soundtrack, which went with the movie nicely. <BR>Everything in this movie really gets felt out...the city slumness of the location, the urban desperation, Eric's pain...it all comes together nicely. The only scene that bothered me was the one where Eric falls out of the window, but they DID have to use computers to do that one since he was dead by then... Do NOT turn this movie off if you don't get into it as soon as it starts. Brandon gets it together as soon as he starts having the flashbacks and the plot thickens from then on. <BR>I haven't seen the DVD so I have no idea if the extra features blew or were actually good. The VHS I saw had a pretty eeeh delated scenes section, and it also had what the makers tooted as the last on-camera interview with Brandon Lee. This is extremly enjoyable for those who can just oogle at him, which is what I did. It's not an incredbily in-depth thing, but he comes off nicely, and it's very novel to see him dressed in something other than black leather, AND without the make up. (*dreamy sigh*)<BR>In short, you DO want to see this. The flim has been critized for excessive violence, but, hey,how are you supposed to get the vengence concept across? Furthermore, I personally don't think it was all that bad. While I can think of lots of movies that ODed on the gore front (Interview with the Vampire comes to mind), The Crow doesn't cross that line. I do regret that it's more famous because of Brandon's death any for its merit, but that is to be expected. Once you see the film, you'll understand it *does* have merit.  <BR>And as to weather the bird is a raven or a Crow--that's being just a bit picky, and how many people actually know the difference these days?
B00005QG9J|5.0|You should buy this album if you like anything incubus has ever done. You will not be disappointed.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|mixed in with the eyecandy is the same old plotline.  you've heard it before, you've seen it done a million ways.  moulin rouge does it differently.  the images and the sheer description of this movie cannot be put into words but that it is simply a miasma, a beautiful and desperate thing.   the acting is solid, and well-cast.  nicole kidman has really come up in the world with her talent, in both this and 'the others', another fabulous movie that came out the same year.   one scene in particular is 'el tango de roxanne' - the music, also, simply put, is some of the most incredible stuff i've heard in quite awhile.  if you're the type who loves a beautiful image, and savours it, you'll cry at this movie.  if you go for plot, you might be somewhat disenchanted.
0385505833|5.0|I was so used to reading books from Grisham about government conspiracies and enormous court cases -- not to mention the titles that begin with &quot;The&quot; -- that it hadn't occurred to me that Skipping Christmas would be the light and heart-warming comedy that it is.<br />Having waved good-bye to their daughter at the airport the day after Thanksgiving, Luther and Nora Krank have a great idea: why not skip the hustle of shopping, cooking and decorating this year and go on a cruise instead? And so, the Kranks decide to boycott Christmas altogether -- to the dismay of their neighbors, who now see Luther as Scrooge. A hilarious tale of how the Kranks try to avoid the cheerfulness and holiday excitement of their annoying neighbors begins.<br />We've all wished we could skip Christmas -- after all, who wouldn't trade the hustle and reckless spending over a nice soothing Caribbean cruise? I know I certainly would! Who knows? I'll probably trade Christmas in favor of a nice vacation next year! And I don't have to worry about the neighbors interfering!:-)<br />Read this gem! You'll be impressed with John Grisham's comedic effort. He ought to write these more often.
6300214044|4.0|David Lynch's Elephant Man has a cinematic style that has been called Steampunk and compared to the early fantastic fiction of Tom Powers and James Blaylock. Steampunk was coined as a retro analogue to Cyberpunk. The movie itself does not fit in that subgenre label.<br />Peter Nicholls, in the Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, in his entry on Steampunk, mentioned the film in this context: &quot;Steampunk is a US phenomenon, often set in London, England, which is envisaged as a once deeply alien and intimately familiar, a kind of foreign body encysted in the US subconscious....not so much the actual 19th century as a 19th century seen through the distorting lens of Charles Dickens, whose congested, pullulating 19th-century landscapes were the foul rag-and-bone shop of history from which the technological world, and hence the world of SF, originally sprang. Somewhere behind most Steampunk visions are filthy coal heaps or driving pistons. It was a vision that also entered the cinema, especially through David Lynch, first in Eraserhead (1976) and then in The Elephant Man (1980), and even -- inappropriately enough -- in much of the mise-en-scene of his movie Dune (1984).&quot;<br />John Clute and Paul J. McAuley, both themselves accomplished SF writers, in the Encyclopedia of Fantasy, gave an entry to Steampunk as a subgenre of fantasy as well as SF, but they do not mention any movies or Lynch. They do differentiate Steampunk from Gaslight Romance, though both share the romanticized 19th-century London setting. Gaslight Romances border on supernatural fiction and fantasies of history, whereas Steampunk is more closely Technofantasy that features anachronism or alternate world settings, and urban fantasy. Dickens is mentioned again, his London a Babylon on the Thames. John Grant, another SF writer, gave David Lynch his own entry plus one on &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990). He mentions Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, and Dune, but does not connect them to Steampunk. He does give Lynch his importance to fantasy with Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet (1986) and describes both as urban fantasy and surrealism.<br />Admittedly, both encyclopedias are not very helpful to Lynch's early work. The Elephant Man is not even presented as fiction. But neither as a documentary. Lynch has taken obvious creative liberty in his film's look, sound and narrative. It is more conservative and naturalistic than Eraserhead, its artistic flourishes are kept to a minimum, but flourishes they still are. The several short sequences of dreams and thought dot the film, make waves in the flow of the otherwise straight story. These scenes could not have come from any true source as the main story had. They qualify as fiction and as Steampunk, as they include actual steam, driving pistons and heaps of coal, as well as rampaging bull elephants.  At one point the producer was considering picking unknown talent Brett Weston as the disturbing freak of a man but he was considered to be too much to look at even with the film in black and white.  It also didn't help that just before filming was to start he was caught in a gay cinema with his trousers round his ankles and a small terrier yelping for it's life. A tragic waste of a comedy talent.<br />The non-fiction bulk of the film is kept historically real and accurate, no anachronisms and no fantastic technologies. Everything seen here was real, from the medical office officials and the uppper-class personages, complete with opera glasses, down to the bloody operating rooms, dusty specimen labs, squalid streets and alleyways, and the carnival. Every freakshow performer was real and documented, and actual dwarfs, giants and unusual people were among the film's cast. The makeups that recreate that infamous visage perfectly match the actual photographs and plaster casts Merrick himself taken in the 1880's. The entire cast bears the meticulous makeups and costumes that portray the period. Lynch and his crew have done an impeccable job all around.<br />Yet, there frequently is lots of steam and smoke, and occasionally punk kids on the streets (no trendy &quot;punk rock&quot; look here), and more often adults of the lower classes with their ill manners and nasty attitudes. No telling what types one might bump into downtown. There is that distorting lens, that peculiar conveyance that can easily be mistaken for Steampunk. No one may have thought of inventing a new niche of fantasy, no writers may have borrowed from the film. But when a critic noticed a stylistic similarity between certain novels and certain films, Steampunk was named. Lynch and his Elephant Man were labelled.
B00003CXTG|5.0|BLOWN AWAY!!!!..... are the words that best describe my reaction after watching this AWSOME movie! Even after watching it for the 2nd and 3rd times my reaction never changed.  Pearl Harbor delivers a four star cast, a great story line, a acurate and honerable depiction of the actual bombing, great special effects, a mind blowing soundtrack, and most important of all leaves you with a stronger admiration for our veterans and an overwhelming feeling of American pride! Some may criticize that the movie is too long. However, if you really think about it, developing a plot, characters, and doing JUSTICE to depicting the most devistating attack on America that in addition resulted in the U.S. entering into WWII all in your typical one and a half till two hour movies running time, that is a TALL ORDER if you ask me! I have also heard &quot;UHHHH,IT'S A LOVE STORY&quot;.  Well yes it does have a love story in it but it is NOT ABOUT A LOVE STORY! I feel sorry for those people who only see that, they did not get what they should have out of this movie.  The love story is actually a very important part of this movie because it makes the story personal. A, &quot;this could have been you&quot;, &quot;this could have been your girl&quot;, &quot;this could have been your friend&quot; kind of thing! It maked you realise the sacrifice men and women were willing to give up if they should die for this country. That sacrifice was EVERYTHING! Their friends, family, even their future with the woman(or man) of their dreams! The price was high,but they were willing to pay! I actually almost let many of the negative reviews change my mind about purchasing this DVD but I took the chance and have no regrets, just gratitude to the film makers, producers,cast, and the real life heros of this country living and deceased, our veterans! THANK YOU!!!
B00000JZIK|5.0|A classic film about a group of bad guys who don't seem to understand that they are being manipulated by unseen hands. Great acting, dialog and suspense. It is hard to pin down which cast member is the star. Well written and directed and will keep you watching and guessing until the end, then for a while after that.<BR>I had to watch it three times just to &quot;get it&quot;. Grand stuff to watch with a few buddies, sipping some beers and puffing on a good cigar. Check it out

B00005NNT1|5.0|Walt Disney's \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" (1937) remains an enduring landmark in cinema history. Happily, the DVD edition does justice to one of the all-time great films, featuring a pristine transfer and a wealth of archival material. With the exception of \\"Fantasia\\" (1940), Disney never surpassed this remarkable achievement in animation.
6301763041|4.0|This film has been one of my favourites since i can remember. Johnny Depp is outstandingly gorgeous and the humour comes sure and fast. Not once did i want it to end and on many occasions i have caught myself singing and dancing along to the songs. A must see for any Depp fans...in fact a must see for everyone.
0871137380|5.0|This is by far one of the best books which I have read.  Being addicted to Tom Clancy novels, this book surpasses those if not solely for the fact that it is non-fiction, then also for the fact that the minute-by-minute account of the events in Somalia were so gripping that I found myself getting less sleep at night for a week while I read it.  I feel that there is little need to go on any farther about this book since the 350+ reviewers before me have largely agreed with me.  The people have spoken.
B00003CXTG|1.0|3 words can describe this movie: Titanic in khakis. The first 30 minutes or so of this movie will drive all testosterone from the room you're in. This is, without a doubt, a movie destined to be shown on Lifetime or Oxygen cable channels. Let there be no mistake who the target audience was: young teenage girls. <br />The special effects in the attack scene were amazing, but the story was a blatant rip-off of Titanic and Top Gun (even down to the pilots buzzing the air control towers and having a character named \\"Goose\\"). Overall, this movie didn't come close to all the hype around its release. I was thoroughly disappointed when the movie was over. Save yourself some time; the 30-minute attack scene is the only part worth watching. It takes more than just a pile of money (even $135 million) to make a good movie.
0811828697|5.0|This is one of those books that appears every so often, and if you don't buy it you regret for years to come.  The book is packaged in a textured synthetic dewback hide so be aware that no Dewbacks were hurt in the making of this book!!  The illustrations are rich, and full of life, and color.  The simple line sketches along with the reserved amounts of colors truly bring the creatures to life.  I certainly hope that amazon will allow some of the pictures to be seen so that the reader can witness just how beautiful these drawings are!  The authors, and artists explore some of the more well known, and some new creatures that inhabit the star wars universe, and do so in an intelligent, and also educational manner.  The book is a little pricey for the mildly interested, or younger buyers, but it is a book that can, and hopefully will be treasured for years.  A true winner and well worth a 5 star rating!
B00005JKES|3.0|I love the show and can't wait for the DVD to come out, but why no pilot and no commentary by Lynch? Without these things, it almost makes the DVD set pointless. Nonetheless, episodes 1-7 are very good and I'm happy they are on DVD.
B00005QDW1|3.0|I own every No Doubt cd and this one is their poorest so far.  Self-Titled, Beacon Street and Tragic Kingdom are two classic cds that everyone should own.  Return of Saturn was mellow, but still original and full of great sound.  But, Rock Steady lacks so many things that the other cds possess. The band is hardly noticable and if I had never heard of No Doubt and this was the first cd by them I purchased, I would think Gwen Stefani was a solo act. Don't get me wrong, I love her vocals and writing/music ability. But, there is more to No Doubt than her. This cd is too much synth and not enough band.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This album may be the most consistently radio-friendly record since Fleetwod Mac's Rumours... Rock Steady is, fundamentally, twelve hit singles in a row, an instant greatest hits compilation, with a strong cast of producers leading the band through the past twenty years of pop music; &quot;Hey Baby&quot; is dancehall by way of a Timbaland-esque rythm, &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; is pure 80's bubblegum, and &quot;Hella Good&quot; is what the new Michael Jackson should have sounded like. The only exception is perhaps Prince's sub-par production contribution &quot;Waiting Room.&quot; While the record may not have come from the heart, it's forgivably obvious that No Doubt entered the studio with few intentions but to make hook-laden pop music for kids of all ages. <br />Hey, at the end of the day, I like my obscure, experimental, indie music just like any other discerning snob. But I'm not stupid; this album is pure pop genius.

0679879269|3.0|The Amber Spyglass was a dismal conclusion to Pullman's  Dark Materials trilogy.  I am desperately trying to make sense of what I read. Pullman went off on too many tangents in this finale - Balthamos and Baruch; the mulefa (huh??), Metatron; the senile &quot;Authority&quot;; the love story between Will and Lyra, the flow of the Dust or Sraf into the netherworld; Instead of tying together loose ends,  Pullman introduces too many unrelated and ridiculous elements which greatly detract from the initial story's credibility.  The finale fails in that it<BR>introduces and then unsuccessfully tries to address too many gargantuan themes.  I would have just been content with a thorough and plausible explanation of Dust and its relation to the Subtle Knife.
B00003CXTG|2.0|This movie has Jerry Bruckheimer written all over it.  The love story was unbelievably sappy and contrived.  The only redeeming aspect of the movie was the Pearl Harbor attack (which they also managed to screw up by drawing it out for what seemed like an hour).  They should have ended the movie there but instead they had to involve a Baldwin, only making the movie that much worse.  I also despised the subtle attempts to dispel myths that have persisted concerning the attack on Pearl Harbor (i.e. that Roosevelt knew the attack was coming and even welcomed the attack in order to go to war).  Let people make up there own minds instead of inserting historical inaccuracies which portray the studio's version of what the they believe happened.<br />Like I mentioned, the only worthwhile part of the movie was the incredible Pearl Harbor attack scene and the incredibly beautiful Kate Beckinsale.  Other than that, this movie reeked of Hollywood commercialism.  A great historical film??? Not Hardly.  A maudlin love story which cheaply capitalizes on one of the most hallowed events in American history??? That sounds about right.<br />(I can see Jerry Bruckheimer racking his brain trying to figure out how he can portray the story of two NY Firefighters and the events of 11 September 2001.  Played by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, of course.)
0440219078|1.0|This book is awful.  The author, Lois Lowry, is gifted, and what others have written about her writing is true - she is good at conveying degrees of pain and pleasure, astounding at introducing a concept as if the reader has never come across it before (color, music, etc.).  The problem is Lowry's agenda, maybe only one an adult could see.  The deep dark secret of Jonas' community is euthanasia - unwanted or unfeasible babies and the extremely aged and fragile are injected with death-inducing drugs.  This seems to be a veiled attempt to poison the impressionable reader against abortion and the right-to-die, by playing on his/her emotions - Jonas is so stunned by what he sees his \\"father\\" do to  a baby that he refuses to go home, and runs away from the community.  (...)
B0000399WI|5.0|I am the 480th reviewer and am also giving this movie 5 stars.  The Shawshank Redemption, in my opinion, is one of the greatest movies ever made.  I just happened to watch this movie while reading Viktor E. Frankl's &quot;Man's Search for Meaning.&quot;  Both dovetail perfectly in elaborating on the human spirit.  This movie also contains the most gratifying ending of any movie except maybe &quot;The Sixth Sense.&quot;
B00000F14B|5.0|I recently watched this movie for the first time in about 20 years and was blown away by how good it was.  I'd forgotten pretty much everything about it save a couple songs.  Seeing it has gotten me hooked on old movies and I'm looking for different ones I can rent or buy.  This is definently a first class, five star movie.
B000002VCU|4.0|This is about gambling, loss, and desperation.  Anyone who has prowled the casinos of Las Vegas at 2:00am and seen the glassy-eyed one-arm-bandit players hopelessly, robotically dropping coins into the slot machines hour-after-lost-hour will dig this album.  The orchestration is lush - lots of brass - and lyrics might bring a tear to your eye, especially on the lovely &quot;Time.&quot;
B00005N9CV|2.0|This review comes from a big DK fan from Canada who loves her style and piano. This is easily her worst CD; no edge to her voice, which is muted for some reason, piano almost nonexistent, strings take long monotonous solos, questionable song selections for a a jazz singer. Even Cry Me A River doesn't make it whereas live in concert she does a a bang up job. Buy &quot;All For You&quot; or  &quot; When I Look in Your Eyes&quot; to hear the real Diana. I hope that she doesn't make this kind of mistake again
0060922583|4.0|Talbot's book reads like a pot-boiler.  I think I read it two sittings (the only other book that I read so fast was The Amityville Horror in 1978!).  Talbot weaves his theory that the universe is a hologram around findings in neuroscience and particle physics.  He then brings in every paranormal phenomenon one can think of to fit into this theory - reincarnation, out of body experiences, ESP, UFOs, psychokinesis, etc. etc.  This is both the strength and the weakness of the book.  While having a theory that describes all of these phenomena is like finding the Rosetta Stone, I found myself thirsting for alternative explanations as well, just to get a comparison.  But still, Talbot's book is a page-turner and is recommended.
B000002UB6|3.0|But,as usual, Paul saves the day with some good ones. This old vinyl has been in storage off and on for over 30 years. The fact is that some of these tunes may have been barely acceptable by a second-tier outfit, but not for the top band of them all(though the BeachBoys can give them a run). &quot;Two of Us&quot;, &quot;I Dig A Pony&quot;,I Me Mine&quot;, &quot;Dig It&quot;, &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;, &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot; &quot;One after 909&quot;, and &quot;Four You Blue&quot;  are among this band's lamest efforts, showing a real deterioration in quality.None of these goes anywhere,and they're even worse now than when I first heard them as an impressionable youth. John's &quot;Across the Universe&quot; seems to usher in some &quot;New Age&quot; (really mainly old quasi-spiritual) malarky,but it still has a nice melody and interesting sound. &quot;Let it Be&quot; I would cite as one of their all-time best,another winner for Paul,but this version,clattering  fuzz-tone (?) guitar and all, is practically ruined by the noise. The milder single version was much better.&quot;Long and Winding  Road&quot; is another overlooked <BR>Paul beauty, and the Specter arrangement shines. And &quot;Get Back&quot; is the only rocker here with some class and fun, a nice ending to a flawed last time out.

B000002KB8|5.0|Of all the early SABBATH albums, I think this one has stood the test of time the best. SABBATH would go on to make many great<br />albums, but their first album still remains my favorite.<br />For one , BILL WARD's drumming is outstanding on this, especially<br />on THE WIZARD, BEHIND THE WALL OF SLEEP and WICKED WORLD. His<br />drumming has never been so energetic and adventurous, tho his<br />drumming on PARANOID and VOL 4 is also quite..umm.. good!!!<br /> This album and PARANOID, to me, really helped define heavy<br />metal, in terms of the loud, grungy guitar riffs and the lyrics.<br />OZZY OSBOURNE's vocals may be the album's only flaw, but it's<br />only a minor flaw and man, would he improve rather quickly on<br />their next album! SABBATH had also never sounded more bluesy<br />or jazzy,due in part to GEEZER's bass playing and BILL WARD's<br />drumming. My favorite tracks include every song except WARNING,<br />tho WARNING is still a great track and is essentially a showcase<br />for TONY IOMMI's guitar playing. THE WIZARD is one of SABBATH's<br />funniest songs, partly because of OZZY's harmonica playing.<br />BEHIND THE WALL OF SLEEP has WARD's coolest drum beat ever.<br />I COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON!<br /> BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00005N9CV|4.0|I am without a doubt a huge Dian Krall fan, and I must admit that I was a little disappointed when I first played this CD. I have every CD she has ever produced, and I can't think of one that ever disappointed me. I am so used to the wonderful upbeat jazzy tunes she has given us in the past, that it took me a while to warm up to the decidedly different Latin feel of&quot;The Look of Love.&quot; Having said that, I have warmed up to it, and I have found this to be a wonderfully relaxing and even romantic collection of tunes. All of the arrangements are fresh and full of life, and are made complete with Diana's vocal talents.<br />Diana continues to impress with her uncanny ability to sell a lyric as she seems to pour so much emotion into everything she sings. Anyone can sing a lyric, but it takes a special talent to make you feel the words, and Diana seems to do it with such ease. Diana takes such remakes as &quot;S'Wonderful&quot; and &quot;The Look of Love&quot; and some how makes them her own. She proves that she has mastered the art of the breathy ballad with songs like &quot;I Get Along Without You&quot; and &quot;Maybe You'll Be There&quot;. (Listening to many of these songs brings back memories of Michelle Phifer draped over the piano in &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;) For die hard Krall fans this will be a departure from the norm, but it's a trip well worth taking. Pop this CD into the stereo and curl up with someone you love, you won't be disappointed.
0451169514|4.0|There's a lot to this book.  One would think that would be obvious, simply based on the sheer size of the thing, but the fact of the matter is that this story also covers a remarkable span of theme and quality in its groping quest for...well, something, because this is certainly different from much of what King wrote around the time this was published.<br />To start, the good, and there is plenty of it.  The novel itself tells a story that manages to be compelling and suspenseful (as suspenseful as a forum where you manage the pace yourself can be, I suppose) throughout, which is probably good enough for most die-hard readers of King.  The characters themselves are fairly endearing, though they're certainly more than a little two-dimensional at times.  On the whole, the book would be fairly average, however, were it not for the occasional flashes of brilliance that King shows in his writing.  One you may want to look out for is Mike's father's description of the burning of the Black Spot, but most of the historical interludes manage to find a special level of storytelling that set them apart from the rest and achieve the degree of quality that shows up in King's later, better work (Heats in Atlantis, Desperation, etc.).<br />The book isn't all warm fuzzies, however--there are some serious problems that some readers may have with this novel.  First off, though I hate to say it, the length is a problem.  This is basically two books in one, since King sets out to tell completely two complete cycles of conflict between the children and Pennywise, and when you add that to King's general tendency to bloat a little, you've got a massive piece of work.  What's more, the organization will probably throw some people--I hate having to pay attention to datelines to know what timeframe I'm in.  Fortunately, this isn't as big a problem as it could be, and I managed to keep up perfectly well, but it still may be a concern for some people.<br />Now, I'm not easy to offend, but evenI have to admit that he went out on a few limbs when he wrote this book for no apparent reason.  There are some undertones that some would label misogynistic, and one particularly distressing scene near the end concerning Beverly and the rest of the group.  I certainly wouldn't recommend that just any teenager be allowed to read the novel, and any overly sensitive adults might want to reconsider before they give it a shot as well.  Additionally, the characters are sometimes so defined by their various outcast traits that they strain the bounds of believability, which may keep those approaching the book from a skeptic's perspective from fully enjoying the experience.<br />Overall, however, you have to consider what audience is likely to read this book in the first place.  There are some King books that I would recommend to anybody.  This is not one of them.  If you've read other work by Stephen King that you like, you'll probably find this book right up your alley, and if you're in the market for a good old fashioned horror read, you won't be disappointed.  Ultimately, though, the novel's riskier moves probably serve to alienate any readers outside of King's usual &quot;fan base,&quot; so if you're looking for a first book by Steve, I'd point you towards Desperation or Hearts and Atlantis before trying to tackle It.
B000002GQE|5.0|Definitely by far the Moodys' best,it's right up there with &quot;Pepper&quot; and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;,and maybe a dozen others from the period.On second thought,it might be better than either,and it seems more timeless!! And it stands on it's own now. At the time, it really was unique. How many pop/rock groups blended a continual,melodic sound with full orchestration? In fact, it may be even better now since the orchestra (for me) was often a generally avoided part of any record, way back when (like in, say,&quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;). The whole project is well done,the flow great,the vocals fine,too,and the concept of a day's journey really good stuff. If it sounds perhaps a little amateurish or popsy today, that's okay.Just figure that it was directed at a young audience,and thankfully,was a big hit then,and will stay good for a long time to come!

B00004YC2F|5.0|This CD is all wonderful and a reference one. <BR>Volodos, a genius &quot;specially touched&quot; by God, have a so particular vision of Rachmaninov that estonish.<BR>The Rach piano concert #3, is performed perfectely in a superior technique, but always with &quot;that vision&quot; that make Volodos unique in performing Rachmaninov. <BR>Despite all, I still preferring the performance of Tamas Vasary (Deutsche Grammophon) for the concert #3, perhaps technically &quot;less perfect&quot; but emotionally more filled with that romanticism sweetly slightly decadent that make Rachmaninov so unique.<BR>The track #4, an arrangement of the Volodos itself for piano solo, of a concert for cello and piano or Rachmaninov, it's absolutely so totally &quot;complete&quot; to be a paragon.<BR>You'll never get tired to listen at it and every time you will discover some new detail to make it evergreen. <BR>For me, this cd must not to be missed and will always represent a reference point for the Rachmaninov's music lovers.<BR>Have a lot of pleasure listening at it.
B00004RFDW|5.0|This story is a cautionary tale to those who go up against big, powerful corporations. Jeffrey Wigand went up against the tobacco companies and lost just about everything but his integrity. I was absolutly riveted by the performances and the story. This the first movie I'd seen Russell Crowe in and it's not hard to see why he was nominated for an Oscar for this role. His portrayal of a complex person in a tight spot was great. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat and pondering the dilemmas the characters face for long after.

B00003CXTF|1.0|This is the first and last review I will write. I am only writing today because I feel so strongly about this movie. <br />Unless you want to watch some cheesy love story, do not get this movie. Instead, just watch history channel, it is much better. I truly felt I was watching Top Gun, and every sickening love story ever on the big screen. The only cool parts were those of the diesel engines, and Pres. Roosevelt getting out of chair by himself. No wait, falling in love with someone over a 2-day period, and then sleeping with his friend is pretty cool too. Other than that, I can't tell you how horrible this movie was.
B00003CXAQ|5.0|ONE  OF THE BEST ACTION FILMS I HAVE SEEN.KATE CAPSHAW IS GREAT!I THINK HARRISON AND KATE HAVE GOOD CHEMISTRY TOGETHER WITH SENSE OF HUMOR TO ADD ALOT OF FUN WITH THIS EXCITING MOVIE. &quot;A MUST TO SEE&quot;
B00005OMTT|5.0|I have never liked any other CD as much as I like this one. I have listend almost non stop for several days, I cannot get enough of the rich sound and the beat and the words, the awsome originality of all the songs.<BR>I put back some old dance music CD, the &quot;Amber&quot; trying to compare them, trying to figure out what is different. I was ready to break this one to pieces, what a waste of money!<BR>And to think I did not know anything about Enigma until 2 weeks ago...I am buying all Mike Cretu and his wife Sandra's CD's one by one.
0792839749|2.0|This is one of my family's favorite movies -- the low rating is for the pan and scan version.  Why do so many studios insist on altering the creative content of their family films?  A simple solution is to offer both versions of the film on the same DVD. It's a shame that a film like this - originally presented in Panavision - suffers from a poor DVD release.  Otherwise, the wonderful and original Sherman Brothers score - plus the charm of the film's actors and the beauty of the location filming - are as much fun now as they were 30 years ago.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is THE definitive adaptation of Pride and Prejudice and is as much pleasure to watch as the novel itself is to read. The actors are superbly cast and the language and scenes are faultless (yes, even those Jane Austen could NEVER have written, such as Mr. Darcy working off his sexual frustration with an impromptu dip in the lake). Colin Firth is very sexy as Mr. Darcy. I could watch him looking at Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth Bennett while she plays the piano in his home all day.<br />However, this is not just a treat for the girlies. My husband also loves this series and we have watched it together at least 3 or 4 times since we bought it last year.
B00003CXTF|5.0|i don't get why people hated it. yea it kinda like titanic with the whole love story in a historical event. but would they really get alot of money with just a movie with historical facts in it. that would just be a documentury which most people don't even watch any way. for the special effect remeber it just a movie it not like they can go back in time and film the real thing. it's not going to look perfect. for the casting however great job. Josh Harnett is really hot. i thought the movie was great. the press is just wack. it worth every penny.
B0000508U6|4.0|This lovely act of bravery shows there still are some male artists who are in touch with their sensitive side and not afraid to show it.  Coldplay takes a unique leap down the trail of modern music- and takes time to stop and smell the roses.  Pure Artistry.
0316776963|3.0|I hate short stories. They leave me wondering why the author didn't think the character or the plot significant enough to explore in the greater detail of a novel. That said, I really enjoyed Sedaris's &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;. The first half of the book, &quot;One&quot;, was filled with stories about Sedaris's family. Stories of the sort that every family retells around the kitchen table when gathered together again as 'grown-ups' (Remember the time Amy came home in the fat suit and dad thought she'd REALLY gained all that weight?!? Mom and Dad love that new dog more than they EVER loved us kids when we lived at home!). Amusing and fun to read. &quot;Deux (Two)&quot; recounts Sedaris's time as an &quot;ex-pat&quot; in France. Having struggled through French, German and Spanish myself and watching my own ESL students learn to untangle reflexives made this half of the book particularly amusing. Fun, witty, loony and irresistibly funny: just like the reviews say.
B00003CX5P|2.0|(...) The reason why I liked the movie was the scene when the battle droids got activated on the planet Naboo to confront the loose army of Bings' companions. That was cool. I loved the saber-fights too and I loved the Jedi-talk (may the force be with you, etc.). I even bought the video, because after having not seen it for a while I thought of this movie as cool and, well, I liked the other Star Wars movies when I was kid and after all, somebody gave it to me as a present. <br />That's how I came to own SWI on video. After watching the movie at I suddenly realized that this movie has no real sense or intellect behind it. There's a lot of awesome special effects, but visual effects are not exactly the reason I watch movies for. First of all, Episode I, prayed for by loads of fans for decades, does not fit into the scheme of the later 3 episodes at all. Alright, we get to see what Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi (however you spell that mofo)looked like as a kid, but the invasion of Naboo has nothing to do with the universe-threatening conflicts of episode IV-VI. It is just a plot giving room to lots of action, but unfortunately stands in no plausible relation to the storyline of the supposed sequels. <br />(...)
B00005NI5Y|2.0|After all the hype, this was the biggest disappointment of the year for me. Dylan's dabbling in Tin Pan Alley or Stephen Foster-type songwriting just doesn't cut it. He doesn't have the voice. This kind of thing has been done to death and with far better results by the likes of Leon Redbone. I was hoping for more of the type of thing he did on Time Out of Mind or his Oscar-winning song for Wonder Boys. This is silly posturing on the part of a true musical original and trendsetter.
B000002B7M|5.0|Well what can I start to point out... This is a classic piece of art!<br />First of all  this was the first album with Ozzy Osbourne I listened to,  and still this album touches my heart. With the classic riffs from one of the greatest guitarists ever lived  named Randy Rhoads, ( RIP ) this was a smashing debut from Ozzy. With classics as... Oh forget it, all the songs on this album are classical, this is a good album filled with song that makes you a happy Ozz-fan! For people that are new to Ozzy's music I can only say, that this is maybe the best record to start out with! so buy it and hear it!!<br />For other Black Sabbath/ and  Ozz-fans like myself I can only say... You can't live without  it...  <br />I simply just say; Buy it....
0679721037|5.0|One of the most remarkable things about John Hersey's Hiroshima is when it was published, within a year after the bomb was dropped.  It is easy to admit our faults, it is easy to show our mistakes--if faults and mistakes they were--many years after the fact.  But to face the horrendous, factual reporting of the effect of the atom bomb on the citizens of Hiroshima so soon after the fact, is in itself remarkable, and a tribute to not only the New Yorker, which published Hersey's account, but to the strength and open mindedness of the American people in their willingness to assume responsibility for what we had done.<br />It is the opinion of many people, myself included, that World War II was America's finest hour because we faced an enemy in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan that had to be defeated, and we defeated them.  But it is also the opinion of many people that we did something so monstrous and so unnecessary by being the first (and still the only) people to use nuclear weapons against civilian populations, that it is hard to find justification, redemption or peace of mind.  Could Hiroshima have been avoided?<br />The second most remarkable thing about John Hersey's Hiroshima is the utter lack of editorializing, the complete absence of any sort of political statement, the sheer avoidance of the maudlin and any kind of deliberate jerking of tears in the text.  Hersey lets the reportage speak for itself.  The elegant flat tonal quality of his report serves all the better to let us see exactly the human consequences of Truman's monumental decision.  The terse, evocative quality of the titles of the four parts of the book, \\"A Noiseless Flash,\\" \\"The Fire,\\" \\"Details Are Being Investigated,\\" and \\"Panic Grass and Fever Few\\" tell in skeleton form the entire story, and suggest, ever so subtly, the appalling suffering and loss that the people of that Japanese city experienced.<br />Hersey began with the moment--\\"The Noiseless Flash\\"--when the bomb dropped, and ended with the naturalistic aftermath as he described how in \\"Panic Grass and Fever Few\\" the grasses grew back and green velvet covered much of the ground under the blast.  This follows the ironic bureaucratic response suggested  in \\"Details Are Being Investigated.\\"<br />Yes, let's investigate the details, for all the good that will do.  Let's also second guess Truman's decision, for all the good that will do.<br />Fifty-five years have now passed.  A long time.  And still there remains the question: did we do the right thing?<br />Social critic Paul Fussell wrote some years after Hersey's report an essay entitled, \\"Thank God for the Atom Bomb\\" in which he argued persuasively that the United States really had no choice, and indeed Truman's decision was the only one he could make.  The main point being that to take the island of Japan with conventional forces would have cost the US a million casualties.  It was strongly believed that the Japanese would fanatically defend their homeland, even with sticks and stones if necessary.  A secondary argument concerned the position of the Soviet Union.  During the time it would take to ensure surrender by conventional forces, the Soviet Union would probably become involved, and Japan might have become a divided country as is Korea today and as was Germany not too long ago.  In the final analysis, this argument goes, at least hundreds of thousands of lives were saved and the Japanese themselves benefitted from being the vanquished of the US alone, allowing us to help them to a speedy recovery.<br />There are other arguments about demonstrating the bomb on a coral island, and the counter argument that there were only two bombs, and that at any rate our resolve to use the bomb would not be proven by such a demonstration, etc.<br />I used to teach Hersey's Hiroshima to high school students, and I would include Fussell's easy as a counterpoint.  My feeling has always been that Truman did indeed do exactly what he had to do.  Whether that was the right thing to do is another matter.  Curious.  I don't think Truman could have acted otherwise, but I am not so sure it was the right thing to do.  Such is the nature of our ability to know and live the truth.<br />Hersey's insistence on focusing on the everyday people of Hiroshima--on Miss Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk at the East Asia Tin Works, who had just turned her head to talk to another girl, on the Rev. Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who was two miles from the center of the explosion, delivering a cart of clothes to a home in the suburbs, and on four others--allowed him to universalize the Japanese experience so that everyone in the world might know that these people could be anybody.<br />Perhaps this is the saving grace, that we know beyond any shadow of a doubt the incalculable  human suffering that ensues from the use of nuclear weapons, and so perhaps we will never use them again, us or anyone else.<br />If they had never been used, perhaps the temptation would have been too great, for us, for the Soviet Union, or some other nation, to use them in the hope of gaining some advantage.  But seeing the unmitigated horror of their use, we are all forestalled.<br />I say \\"all.\\"  But would Osama Bin Laden, would Saddam Hussein, use such weapons?<br />Hersey's Hiroshima is therefore not just an artifact of history, but a warning still relevant today as well as a most compelling reading experience.he right thing to do is another matter.

0446677450|2.0|I received this book as a (wanted) gift.  The anecdotal writing style was enjoyable at first but became a little tiresome when stories and ideas were repeated.  Although it claims to be written to help most people get out of the &quot;poor&quot; person's mentality, it won't really provide the drive, methods, and information people would need over the long term.<br />If you have the type of personality that has an abundance of initiative, fearlessness, ambition and focus, this book provides some philosophical--and fewer practical--points to incorporate into your climb to the top.  It is never stated outright, but this book is definitely geared toward those in society who equate success with money and power; the best thing a dad can do for his son is to be rich.<br />Bottom line:  better to rent (from the library) than to own
0767802659|2.0|This movie will be a terrible disappointment to people that have read Heinlein's book. The movie mangles the plot, ignores or misunderstands all of the ideas, and worst (for an action picture) leaves out all of the cool military hardware, arming the soldiers with what look like rejected weapons from the A-Team and armor from a high school football team.    The commentary by Verhoeven and Edward Neumeier (the screenwriter) is illuminating -- neither of them have the slightest understanding of the book, and they keep repeating that the point of the movie is that \\"war makes fascists of us all\\". Heinlein is not one of the more subtle writers, so I can't decide if they were so dumb they didn't get the book, or if they chose to ignore it. On the dumb side, they don't understand plenty of things in their own movie (such as why Denise Richards doesn't come off as a \\"career woman\\"), and the plot details are absurdly incoherent (the bugs shoot at spaceships by farting rocks into space, for instance, and somehow manage to do this over interstellar distances in very short periods of time). And I wasn't able to find any points for the \\"not dumb\\" side.    The acting is, for the most part, rotten. The male lead, Caspar Van Dien, has all the charisma of a blue jeans model (which he might be for all I know), and Doogie Howser is really bad, too. Denise Richards is really pretty, but she's rotten here. The only somewhat bright spot is Dina Meyer, but it isn't enough. All of the details about the society of which they are part are cartoonish and incosistent, and the special effects are lousy wit h the exception of some of the bug attacks. The actors look good naked in the shower scene, and that's the high point of the movie.    It's a waste of time, and there are no armored suits, like those in the book, so don't watch it hoping for an army of RoboCops...
B00003CX5A|5.0|I loved the fantastic worlds that Tim Burton creates and this DVD allows us to see how he creates them.  Great film, great DVD.
6300214354|5.0|Since this incredibly funny movie mostly mocks stereotypical movies (WWII, Blue Lagoon, etc.), it still remains a riot even though East Germany is no more. Nick Rivers, a phenom of a rock star, is invited to visit East Berlin for a cultural festival when Leonard Bernstein cancels. The East German Government is using the festival as a distraction while an unwilling scientist perfects a device to capture NATO's entire submarine fleet. Nick soon becomes involved with the scientist's daughter, then with the underground (an absolutely hilarious French Resistance in East Germany, complete with a black named \\"Chocolat Mousse\\", and a leader who had once been on a Blue Lagoon-style island with the scientist's daughter.) They combine forces to frustrate the East Germans' plans.<br /> Among the most hilarious moments: The German General ordering the death of an escaped spy by using a rubber stamp marked \\"FIND HIM AND KILL HIM\\", the \\"Skeet Surfing\\" music video sequence, the map of Berlin with Nick's route morphing into--no no, I won't spoil it, Nick's anxiety nightmare, from which he wakes up to find himself being flogged, and he expresses his relief, Dr. Flaumond's self-dug tunnel to freedom, the scene where Nick is crawling along the ground, and you see Nazi-style boots standing in front of him--but they are empty. And of course, the Pinto scene . . . <br /> Weaknesses are few . . . the ending is a bit forced and the underwater sequence a bit silly. That's about it.<br /> Well worth seeing, and you'll see it again. Like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, this is a movie where you and your friends will wind up reciting the dialogue to each other.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya is fantastic! I became a big fan after hearing &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; on the radio in early 1996, although I was very aware of her through &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; and the hugely successful, Shepherd Moons. My favorite music is heavy metal, but I bought the sheet music to the Shepherd Moons album for piano, and it revived my love for playing the piano. I have since bought A Day Without Rain sheet music (after waiting a year for the sheet music to come out) and I'll be playing the hugely popular &quot;Only Time&quot; at our graduation in May. As for the album, it is Enya's most uplifting album to date, in my opinion. Great for a rainy day, incidentally. 1995's Memory of Trees was gorgeous but dark (in a good way), and was my favorite until Day W/O Rain came out. My favorite tracks are, of course, &quot;Only Time&quot; (great to hear Enya on the radio again), &quot;Wild Child&quot;, &quot;Flora's Secret&quot;, &quot;Fallen Embers&quot;, and &quot;One By One&quot;. Many have griped about the 35 minute length...well, get over it, the music is awesome! Yes, another song or two would have been great, but the music flows together perfectly. Way to go Enya! And great job on the LOTR Soundtrack!
B00005QEO2|4.0|This is not a bad collection by any means.  The remastering is excellent as both discs sound terrific, even better than I remember them sounding on the original albums.  One reviewer questioned as to whom this collection was intended for?  I have to agree.  Die-hard fans will likely have most of this material already.  The bulk of the collection is taken from the albums, &quot;Permanent Vacation, Pump, Get A Grip, Big ones&quot; and &quot;A Little South of Sanity.&quot;  If you already have these albums, then you really don't need this collection.  There's a couple of B-sides, rarities and the Run-DMC version of Walk this Way, but not enough to warrant getting this set if you have the above-mentioned albums.  If you are new to Aerosmith, or on a budget, then you can't go wrong with this collection.  For myself, it was perfect as I did not want to spend the money on all the albums that the tracks in this collection come from.  So, if economics are a concern for you, this is the best Aerosmith album to get as it's a nice summary of the band's work from the 80's through the 90's.
B00003CXTF|5.0|This movie is amazing. I have seen it 6 times and it still makes me cry. The scene of the bombing of Pearl Harbor put you right inside the hearts of the scared and dying men. The love story is the story inside the story- totally awesome. Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale were great. Everytime I see the movie, it just makes me want to see it again.
B00005O3VD|4.0|It was certainly one of the most memorable screen debuts of all time:  swathed in leopard skin, our Funny Girl saunters up to a backstage mirror, eyes herself in a perfect three-quarters profile, and purrs to her reflection, &quot;Hello, Gorgeous.&quot;  From that moment on, there was no doubt that the appelation fit the film's star to a tee.<br />In this biopic about Fanny Brice -- arguably the greatest stage and radio comedienne who ever lived, Barbra Streisand turned in a remarkable performance -- shaded, multi-layered, hilarious, and pathetic -- and won a well-deserved Oscar to boot.  Her only shortcoming was her inability to match Fanny Brice's unattractiveness.  True, the film makes numerous references to the fact that Fanny wasn't pretty, and Streisand tries in vain to carry off the ugly duckling routine.  It was a wasted effort; Barbra was simply beautiful in each and every frame.<br />Perhaps some of the credit for that goes to the film's director, William Wyler (in his only musical directorial effort), and the cinematographer, Harry Stradling -- whose camera work bathes La Streisand's visage in etheral radiance from start to finish.  Wyler's directorial style was a bit heavy-handed, giving the film a decidedly dated look, but he nonetheless extracted polished, disciplined performances from the actors.  The musical numbers were unimaginatively staged (&quot;Don't Rain On My Parade&quot; is a notable exception), but they succeed largely due to Streisand's vocals.<br />Some supporting players worthy of praise:  Anne Francis, in an abbreviated cameo as Zigfield girl Georgia James, Kay Medford (repeating her Broadway role), as the sharp-tongued, warm-hearted Rose Brice, and Lee Allen as Fanny's friend Eddie Ryan.  Only Omar Sharif, as Nick Arnstein, missed the boat.  Appearing stiff and uncomfortable with the role (Arnstein was not an Arab.), Sharif makes a valiant effort to portray Arnstein sympathetically -- but never manages to connect with the character effectively.<br />Nonetheless, this was Barbra's movie, and she wisely ran with it.  Whether gazing wistfully at Nick Arnstein, or joking with reporters about his arrest for embezzlement (a scene she handles remarkably well for a screen novice), Streisand expertly carried the audience through an almost two-and-one-half hour extravaganza.  The second half of the film dragged just a bit, and some of the dialogue must have seemed cliche even then.<br />But Streisand pulled it off, right up through the tear-soaked finale.  This was the type of big finish that Hollywood legends are made of.  Having just called it quits with Nick, she stands alone in a spotlight, in a simple black velvet dress, summoning all of her resources to make it through &quot;My Man.&quot;  Halfway through, she sniffs back her tears, flings her arms outward, and launches into the song full tilt.  As her voice grows in intensity and power, the scene ends with the spotlight illuminating only her hands and face.  Audiences in 1968 were left stunned, and knew for a fact that they had witnessed the emergence of a major film star.  <br />In a long overdue widescreen presentation, the new DVD incarnation of this musical classic boasts a remastered soundrack and a beautifully restored picture.  Color saturations are intense and vibrant, with skin tones appropriately subtle.  As a whole, the transfer is well-focused and clean, with only occasional artifact present.  Some interesting extras and a clever user interface make for an overall appealing package.  All in all, the DVD presentation is quite an achievement.  For the first time, &quot;Funny Girl&quot; has gotten the treatment it deserves, and we are all the richer for it.

So what do I have to say about Metallica?  Well Just that, They are the best band EVER! (everyone knows that they could beat the livng hell out of the beatles!) And this is their best Album (and if you don't like the Symphony in the mix, then all oyu have to do is buy the DVD vision and it allows you to take out the music from either the Band or the symphony.)  They have most of their best songs on the album plus two new ones (Minus Human and No Leaf clover, both really good songs)  And in my opinon the symphony expands a fills in Metallica's songs with sounds you never hear in Rock.<br />It's a must have Album.<br />.
0446608955|5.0|This book is the only book that has ever made me really cry.  It is heartwarming and very sweet.  The main character really becomes a man as the story progresses and you begin to like him whereas in the beginning of the book he isn't likeable, but is a typical teenager.  It was a very easy read and very hard to put down.
B00005LMBK|4.0|What is supposed to be the first hip-hop group composed entirely of cartoon characters, Gorillaz is actually a side project for some of music's more interesting talents. Blur's Damon Albarn, Dan &quot;The Automator&quot; Nakamura, and Del the Funky Homosapien combine with artist Jamie Hewlett, best known as the mind behind the cult comic Tank Girl to create an interesting beat-driven soundscape. Gorillaz is a rare departure from today's thug-driven hip-hop, and welcome as well. Especially surprising is the frequently uneven rapper Del, who shines on several tracks with some of his best rhymes in years.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This Movie is amongst my list of all time favorites. Its brings forth a new age of musicals, the film features stiring renditions of songs by Elton John, The Police, The Beatles, Patti Labelle and even a slection from The Sound of Music. The film spin and spirals into a dazzling story of truth, beauty, freedom, jealousy, and that which our hero (played and sung by Ewan McGregor) belives in above all things Love. Nicole kidman and Ewan Mcgegor show off there (suprisingly) real incredible singing voices. Other highlights of the film are John Legiuzamo as the drunken bohemian Toluse Lautrec... at the historically correct height. Jim Broadbent as the mildly insane yet heartfelt Harold Zidler (owner of the Moulin Rouge) wows and dazzles. The film combines incredible timeless songs, oscar worthy performances, beautiful cinematography, and a story that will last forever.<br />I close with our hero's (and Nat King Coles) immortal words<br />The greatest thing youll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return.<br />Buy the movie and share it with the world.
6300251616|3.0|By this time, the movie shows its age. The music is sappy and dated - mid 1960s to early 1970s. The plot is as good as 2001: A Space Oddyssey, and this could easily have had some influence on that movie's development.<br />This movie has many funny moments. The Alien is a huge beach ball filled with gas. The Bombs and existential discussions with them remind one of &quot;The HitchHiker's Guide...&quot;<br />The scares have more to do with man vs machine than actual threats on lives.<br />The cool thing about this movie is how it shows the monotony of space travel. When things go wrong, it shows the apathy that grows among the crew, how they procrastinate in emergencies.<br />If you rent or buy this, you WILL be entertained as it has elements of all the mentioned works and more: it ends with a space-surfer.<br />Oh, and it was written and directed by JOHN CARPENTER (Ghosts Of Mars, Vampires, HALLOWEEN, Escape From N.Y. / L.A.).
0790736039|5.0|This movie was so good! The acting excellent, and nobody else but Tim Curry could play Pennywise. And I have to say, ever since I saw the movie, I've been afraid of clowns. Seriously! I was also glad because one of my favorite actors, John Ritter of Three's Company was in it. I just LOVED this movie! I mean, it has this quality to it, when you're watching it. When you're watching it, you think &quot;Oh, come on, this isn't scary!&quot; But then after you're done, you start to think, and you get scared! Or at least that's what happened to me. And now, I tell all my friends about it, and they REALLY want to see it! See this movie! I was almost afraid to, because of Stephen King's the Shining. I saw The Shining when I was seven, and I was never really the same again. But It is so much better, and so un-realistic that it is actually freaky!
B00005O5CM|4.0|I will confess to a prejudice in favor of this movie: having worked at Harvard for six years as a non-tenure-track junior faculty member, I love to see that tweedy, stuffy old institution take a good skewering, and Reese Witherspoon gives it one in this very entertaining if totally implausible comedy.  Reese is Elle Wood, the beautiful Valley Girl whom no one will take seriously because she's too pretty and fashion-conscious for somber, earnest Cambridge, MA, and because her main object in attending law school -- at least when she first arrives -- is to win back her snobbish ex-boyfriend.  Will Elle discover that law is her true calling?  Will she turn out to be brilliant?  Will she amaze everyone in a courtroom scene?  Are you kidding, does the sun rise in the east?  The courtroom scene is about as plausible as the idea that she'd be allowed to keep her pet Chihuahua in a university residence hall, but hey, who cares? <br />Part of the fun, if you've ever been near Harvard, is that although the Cambridge types are caricatured, they're not exaggerated all that much.  I've met the brilliant, eccentric guy with a facial tic, the militant feminist, and a lot of others there.  And though I'm no California fashion plate, I was labeled and dismissed as a frivolous female, too, for posting cartoons on my door and having a copy of the Miss Piggy Art Treasures calendar.  So it's great to be vicariously vindicated by the beautiful Ms. Witherspoon.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|There is something about these songs that gives me energy.   Maybe it is because they are well written songs that are played by great musicians who put a great deal of enthusiasm into their music.   I love this CD!   My favorite tracks are:  Brand New Cadillac, Hateful, Rudie Can't Fail, The Right Profile, Clampdown, Death or Glory, and Train in Vain.<BR>Get this one, it is as classic as they come!!!!!!
B00003CXTG|1.0|Here's an idea for a movie. Spend over 200+Mil on a historical epic with no script.<br />This film is an abysmal disgrace. Instead of a respectful and reasonably accurate portrayal of one of America's most defining moments in history. We get a bloated star vehicle for a very badly directed Ben A. and Cate B.<br />While the visuals are truly magnificent I found myself laughing out loud at the utter blather used as dialog in this film. Not to mention the spectacularly overblown love triangle used to milk more mileage as a non-exhistent plot.<br />If you buy this disc wanting to learn more about Pearl Harbor your much better off buying or renting Tora Tora Tora. Nope the visuals are not as epic. But the level of respect and historical accuracy are much more on par with the impact that Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. The movie Pearl Harbor is pure and simply Visual Velvetta.  Processed cheese product. It gets my vote as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't get suckered in by the hype......it's really bad.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|This is the best.  I admit I had doubts about this movie, being a remake and all.  No one (except maybe Robin Williams) could do this role as the Grinch so well.  I loved this movie.
B00005QDW1|5.0|No Doubt is my favorite band, and the best thing I love about them is that they're not afraid to try something new. With 'Rock Steady', they definitely have tried something new, and in my opinion, I think it's great. I have all five albums they have released, and none of them are at all alike. The only two things this awesome band keeps and brings along with them in each album is their creative, crazy, and fun music, and their love of making it. For Gwen, Tony, Tom, and Adrian...you guys rock! Keep them coming!
B000002JSN|5.0|A regular 40 minute album from them is good enough, but a 2-disc 82 minute album? Amazing! One of the last albums from them that were good. Most of these songs were created from jam sessons. In fact, some of the songs were originally intended to be on earlier albums. Black Country Woman was supposed to be on Houses Of The Holy, and Bron-Y-Aur was originally intended to be on III. The best tracks are In My Time Of Dying and The Wanton Song. They have great energy. Also, there are diffrent sides to them. Funk, country, and folk are in this. A perfect album. GET IT NOW!
0380002930|5.0|I've been reading all the reviews, and I can't understand these people who say it's too long, it's boring...........I loved it.  I had to pick a book to read for a 10th grade project, and this was recommended to me by a friend.  I wasn't sure I would like it-I'm a horse fan-but I loved it.  I was into it from the very beginning.  The characters-all rabbits- are very interesting and dynamic.  I especially loved the made-up rabbit words, confusing to some people, but i thought it was cool.  The story is about a group of rabbits who flee their home in search of a new one.  On the way, they encounter hardships and problems as they try to establish a new warren.  More characters are added as they go on, and each scene is more interesting than the last.  I finished iot in a week, I couldn't put it down.  A few not-so-good words, when your get around Keehar-the seagull-so watch out if you read it to little kids.  All in all, an awesome book, I recommend it to everyone who can read.
B000002UEB|4.0|My first album from this band was Empire, and it blew me away. I love every track on that album. Then, I went and got this. Great stuff, in my opinion, but it's WAY too overrated. Sure, It's got great melody, a teriffic story, and some of the best singing, but it's definetly not the greatest album ever. Can you say &quot;Zoso?&quot; Ok. But anyway, I think this album is a great concept album. Chris Degarmo and Michael Wilson are guitar geniuses. Even the drummer wrote a tune, or a small clip-tune(There are about 5 of them.) Yes, it's like The Wall, but there's no rip-off from it. &quot;Suite Sister Mary&quot; is an amazing tune. I'd never expect them to play evil tunes judging from Empire. Also, &quot;Eyes Of A Stranger&quot; is magnificent. Good ending, too. Poor Nikki. Anyway, it's good, and essential Queensryche, but not GODLY like a lot of people say.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This very hardworking band finally hit the jackpot with this astonishing album. After six years of playing in dreary bars to audiences measured in the single digits, and a series of tragically ignored indie albums and EP's, At the Drive-In have delivered a masterpiece with this album. This hard-to-categorize band mixes hard-driving, no-nonsense hard rock with liberal doses of punk, some grunge and metal, and even a little goth in a few places, with masterful musical chops and mesmerizing vocal arrangements. Ignorant critics and listeners who can't describe anything without making comparisons have mistakenly equated this band to Rage Against the Machine, which is inaccurate at best and insulting at worst. Singer Cedric Bixler's voice naturally has a tone similar to Rage's Zack de la Rocha, but that is merely a coincidence and is a hideous reason for comparing the two bands, both vocally and musically. Bixler is an infinitely better singer than Zack (who can hardly even rap), and Bixler sings with true emotion and passion that is extremely rare for a rock frontman these days.  Also, comparisons to standard nu-metal make me want to puke. The key to understanding this album is to stop trying to figure out what it slightly sounds like, and realize that Relationship of Command is in its own category.<br />The best aspects of this album are Bixler's incredible vocals, along with the gut-wrenching backing screams by guitarist Omar Rodriguez. Drummer Tony Hajjar and bassist Paul Himojos are relentless and to-the-point, while Rodriguez and Jim Ward deliver intricate and dramatic guitar interplay. Bixler's lyrics are dense with allegory and metaphor, and you may spend years trying to figure out what he's talking about in many of the songs. Never mind the cranks who criticize the lyrics for being too dense or wordy, and accept them as intelligent, challenging, and thought-provoking. The best tracks here include &quot;Sleepwalk Capsules&quot; which contains stupendous vocal arrangements (by Bixler, Rodriguez, and Ward); the dramatic &quot;Quarantined;&quot; and &quot;Arcarsenal&quot; and &quot;Non Zero Possibility&quot; which are overflowing with emotional power.<br />As a heavy collector who buys 40-50 new CD's each year, this is my favorite of 2001. I am very upset by reports of this band's breakup (or hiatus). Let's encourage them to get back together.ngements (by Bixler, Rodriguez, and Ward); the dramatic &quot;Quarantined;&quot; and &quot;Arcarsenal&quot; and &quot;Non Zero Possibility&quot; which are overflowing with emotional power.<br />As a heavy collector who buys 40-50 new CD's each year, this is my favorite of 2001.

0393307050|1.0|After reading the Hornblower series I was looking for more.  I got through about two chapters of this and threw it away.  O'brian writes like an old woman.  The story seems to be about tea parties and gossip, the time and setting seem incidental to the story.  Tedious and boring.  If you like Jane Austin, you'll like O'brian, maybe.  Skip it and try Alexander Kents &quot;Richard Bolitho&quot; series.
0812550706|4.0|Let me begin by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this book and others in the series.  It provides an interesting look into the lives of children.  Descriptions of huge explosions and action packed, outer space dogfights are not found on every page; nevertheless, I found the character driven nature of Orson Scott Card's book to work.  The only reason that I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because after reading some negative reviews I understand that for many, suspending their disbelief while reading this book may be difficult (still, it is sci-FICTION).  <br />(...)<br />Perhaps Ender's Game is not Science Fiction in its purest form.  Maybe there are parts that are not completely believable.  But as I see it, that's part of the attraction.  I love STAR WARS, but \\"who has ever heard\\" of a person like Luke Skywalker who can use the Force to call objects to his hand?  <br />Sure most kids don't act and talk as they do in this book, but in an exaggerated way Card shows the isolation that many children (myself included) have felt at some point or another (be for being gifted in certain areas or having difficulty in them).  If you were \\"expecting a book about a grown man\\" then yes, you did read the wrong book.  (...)<br />(...)
0790740443|3.0|Yes, the plot of this movie is incredibly contrived, almost absurdly so. However, the premise of the film is quite interesting. Right around present day, a top-secret government firm recruits (or should I say kidnaps?) male orphans and boys w/out any familial ties in order to mold them into perfect soldiers. The training is ruthless and the weaklings are weeded out; if you can't cut the mustard, you get whacked. In some ways, this reminds me of the regimen instituted by the Spartans of ancient Greece where boys underwent brutal instruction in the art of war between the ages of 7-20.<br /><br />The movie then skips ahead 40 some odd years into the future. By this time, a new breed (literally) of warriors comes to the fore to replace the old school soldiers. This new class of warriors are genetically engineered to be military men. They endanger the old class of becoming obsolete.<br />There is then a competition between a champion of the old guard (Kurt Russell) vs a member of the new (Jason Scott Lee). The talents of Russell, Lee and Gary Busey are all a bit wasted in this movie, but it's nice to see bona-fide actors in an action movie. Indeed, having these 3 perform in a marginal movie like this is like hiring the Morman Tabernacle choir to sing &quot;Happy Birthday.&quot;<br />This is not a great movie, by any stretch of the imagination. However, it is entertaining and boasts top-notch acting. The special effects and sets on the junk-yard-world are quite impressive, too. So, if you're looking for a solid action movie w/out a great plot to round out your action movie collection, this might just be for you. If you demand an exceptional plot from any and every movie you see, I would recommend that you pass this one by.
B00005RHGK|1.0|This is a decent horror flick for the first 60 minutes. However, it begins to get silly and the ending is a major letdown - especially when you've invested the time to get into the story. This could have been a great franchise film but instead the plot just doesn't give the 'punch' you expect from a horror film.
B00003CXQX|5.0|EMPERORS NEW GROOVE is a great film.  David Spade is hilarious as the pint sized ruler who must learn to control his selfishness, and John Goodman does a marvelous job as the big and loveable sidekick.<br />There are so many hysterical gags in this movie (The sequences in the restaurant are priceless) that I literally got red in the face from laughter the first time I saw it.<br />Although not as majestic as HERCULES, LITTLE MERMAID, LION KING, ALADDIN, HUNCHBACK, BEAUTY & BEAST, F2K, or ATLANTIS, it is a hilarious feature that harks back to cartoons of the 1930s and '40s, while at the same time maintaining a very current feel.<br />While EMPERORS NEW GROOVE is very funny, it also contains a very touching and almost tearful message about friendship.  The movie will make you laugh.  Make you cry.  And make you think.<br />But most of all, it will make you feel good.
B0000542DG|5.0|This movie might not be psycically scary but mentally it's absolutely horrifying. this movie will make you think about how you are going to die and what fate has in store for you.i believe they should make more movies like this because mental fear is a lot worse the physical fear. the performances were surprisingly good (espesially the performance by the candyman.)<BR>if you want to be literally scared out of your mind see this movie after all, it is better than the scream movies.(at least in my opinion.)
059035342X|4.0|Before I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J. K. Rowling, I figured it was just another kids' book that had become another childhood fad, like Pokmon.  I figured the book would have characters that were laughable in their in their predictability and shallowness.   I soon found out otherwise.  It turned out to be a very interesting novel with a highly developed plot and characters that seem real.  Yet even as it engages the interests of older readers, with its not-so-complicated reading level, it can be comprehended by young readers at the same time.  Harry Potter is one of those rare novels that parents can read with their children.<BR> Harry Potter, the protagonist of the novel, does not know it, but he is actually a wizard.  The wizards and witches of the world exist in an underground society so that they are not disturbed by the wants of normal people around the world.  Harry lives in a Cinderella-like situation, as his parents have been killed by a powerful evil wizard and he must live with his Aunt and Uncle, who treat him like dust, and his cousin, who continuously bullies him.  But one day his life changes, and he is whisked away to Hogwarts School for Wizards and Witches by an intriguing man who must weigh over 500 pounds.<BR> At Hogwarts, Harry tries to struggle through the daily activities of life, making friends and enemies alike.  He stumbles onto the plot of a few evil teachers who seek to steal the Sorcerer's Stone to set their master, Voldemort, the evil wizard who killed Harry's parents, loose in full power upon the world.  Harry faces the happiest and most challenging time of his life.<BR> I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  I originally read it out of curiosity over what all the fuss was about.  But I will surely read the subsequent novels in the series because it was truly a great book.  Don't think it's a kids' book.  I'm warning you.
B00005QCYD|3.0|If you're looking for a quick-paced action flick with awesome special effects, look no further than Jurassic Park 3.  JP3 is chocked full of dino's with emphasis on the Pteradactyl scene and the new &quot;super dinosaur&quot; - a formidable foe to the T-Rex.  The scenery in the movie, as expected, is gorgeous but the acting (outside of Sam Neill) is average at best.  William H. Macy plays the father searching for his son lost on Dino island and Sam Neill is his guide.  The basic plot of the film is to escape from the island.<br />(TV: 32&quot; Sony Trinitron (KV-32S40))<BR>(DVD player: Panasonic RP-56)<BR>(Cables: Acoustic Reasearch top-of-the-line)<br />Picture quality: Excellent, even the menu is exciting.<br />Sound quality: Excellent as always.  Turn the sub up only half-way and you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br />Jurassic Park 3 is an average film with action being its very core.  While the first JP had action, superb acting and an &quot;epic&quot; feel to it, the third can only live up to the action of the first film.
B00005QDW1|2.0|Electronic Dance is new to this group so I do give it a star for the transition from ska-influenced pop to this....trendy, boring instrumentation, weak voice, packaged MTV goal as if they are screaming for boy band and pop princess appeal. They have those fans but will this album keep the real fans- those who have grown with them? I long for the earlier passion which this cd lacks- only took a year to put out? It shows.<br />Dance gets old. Electronic lacks musical depth. Gwen's personality can't keep this spinning for long. It's ashame that No Doubt feels they must compete with the unoriginal chart toppers of today's music. I'll stick to the very 1st album.
B00005QCYC|5.0|This movie series is the best! Non stop action full of suspense! It also has a very interesting plot to the movie about the dinosaurs being recreated!

B00005JKT8|4.0|This is not Meg Ryan's best film, but it is yet another highly enjoyable romantic comedy in the career of one of the most successful light comedy actresses of the past decade.  But this could be a breakout film for Hugh Jackman, who is easily one of the most likable and charismatic new actors on the scene today.  Easily the best thing about X-MEN was Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine.  He has also appeared in SWORDFISH and SOMEONE LIKE YOU, but after seeing this film, he is clearly a very versatile and talented actor, who deserves a lot of chances in a lot of different kinds of films.<br />The film is enhanced by an excellent supporting cast.  Both Liev Schreiber as Meg Ryan's ex-boyfriend and Breckin Meyer as her brother are extremely appealing.  But the film either falls or stands on the performances of Ryan and Jackman.  This is not, as I mentioned earlier, her best role, but even Meg Ryan at less than her very best is still quite good, and Hugh Jackman is enormously enjoyable.  Natasha Lyonne, who I love a lot, was pretty much wasted in her role as Ryan's secretary.<br />The movie will invariably be compared to other time travel movies.  It is a genre that has been more successful in the past than one might imagine, thanks to the BACK TO FUTURE series and the superb TIME AFTER TIME.  There are a couple of gigantic holes in the plot (one involves when a particular photograph could have been taken), but overall the film isn't hard to take as sci-fi.  I will say that the scenes set in 19th century New York are my favorite parts of the movie.  The initial scene takes place at a ceremony in which Washington Roeblings, the engineer who built the Brooklyn Bridge and son of the man who designed it, is dedicating (I think) the completion of the second tower of the bridge.  The look and feel is remarkable.  Looking at the masts of the ships in the water, I kept thinking of Walt Whitman's poem &quot;Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,&quot; which ferry the bridge superseded.  Most of the imagery was surely computer generated, but the whole scene was nevertheless remarkable to look at.<br />All in all, this movie was a lot of fun.  It won't be the greatest movie you have ever seen, but it certainly won't be the worst, and I think the vast majority of viewers will be convinced that they will have had a lot of fun.  And a message to Hollywood:  get Hugh Jackman in more movies!the imagery was surely computer generated, but the whole scene was nevertheless remarkable to look at.<br />All in all, this movie was a lot of fun.

B00003CY5J|4.0|The Score is a quieter film than most were probably expecting.  It's not a film that is full of flash and style (Oceans 11) or one full of clever tough-guy dialogue (The Heist) or one that eliminates showing the audience crime preparations almost completely (Sexy Beast).  It's a quieter, darker film that feels grittier and seems to have been inspired by an Elmore Leonard novel.  There's a  surprising lack of pyrotechnics, over the top action sequences or breaking glass.<br />The film boasts the contributions of three superb actors: Robert DeNiro, Marlon Brando and Edward Norton. You might think that would encourage excessive scenery chewing behavior on the part of the participants.  It doesn't.  Everyone showed up for this assignment ready to work and make a good movie.  This means everyone in the film is very relaxed in their performances and rarely wear their &quot;I am a damn good actor and movie star too&quot; chops on their sleeves.<br /><br />The actors trust their fellow actors and the script.  The script doesn't try too hard to make these characters overly witty, colorful, quirky or overly repellent either.  As we watch the set up and then the heist take place we actually find ourselves rooting for the criminals.  There are no Police chiefs playing cat and mouse with any of the master burglars.  The script however has some holes in it and it really needed another re-write to smooth some things out and cut out some extraenous material.<br />The film does have a few clich&eacute;'s and caught up in one of them is the utterly wasted love interest Angela Bassett.  She's given a couple of decently written dialogue scenes in which she is radiant, but almost any actress could have played the part. Bassett deserves more than being wasted in a nothing part.<br />  DeNiro plays a master safe-cracking thief named Nick Wells who lives in the old part of Montreal, Canada where he owns and manages a jazz club.  It's time for him to retire.  At his jazz club he is visited by Max, a Sydney Greenstreet type criminal czar played by Marlon Brando.  Max fronts Nick his expense money and usually has a buyer for the merchandise Nick steals.  He of course has a doozy of a proposition for Nick, but it involves robbing a nearly impenetrable fortress that is located in Montreal itself.  Nick Wells has a rule he doesn't want to break and that's robbing any place near where he lives.  He tries to turn the job down.  But this is too good of a job to turn down and it's worth 4 to 6 million dollars for Nick to say yes.  That's more than enough money to retire from the business, pay off the mortgage on his Jazz club and take care of his flight attendant girlfriend, Angela Bassett for the rest of his life.<br />Edward Norton plays the guy inside.  He plays Jack Teller who has been pretending to be slightly retarded  janitor named Brian  and has befriended his co-workers so completely they view him as an utterly harmless worker.  Jack's got the blue prints of the building, and knows where the valuable smuggled French jeweled Scepter (worth 30 million) is located.... But he needs Nick's skills and experience to pull it off.  Will the young upstart Jack take orders from old-timer Nick?  Is the whole deal a set-up doomed to fail?  Can they get away with it?<br />The last half-hour of the film is tense and suspenseful in the way few movies are anymore.  There are no speeding cars, no giant bombing raids, airline crashes, helicopter duels ---... just a couple of robbers trying to pull off a very complicated heist.<br />Credit Director Frank Oz for giving his actors the time in their various scenes to quietly interact with each other.  You haven't seen a film with this much breathing room in a long long time.  Perhaps leaving them completely to their own devices and not demanding something in particular from them meant Oz failed to gain the respect of Brando and the two had their problems relating on the set. . . but it also gives the audience some juicy performances.<br />Edward Norton has the most colorful role in the film and although it would be very easy for him to overdo it, he never does.  It's a marvelous performance and also uses the time he's given to great effect.  The beats of his acting are perfectly tuned.<br />The problem with the film is that besides the acting, the film's script not only has a couple of holes but is pretty bland refusing to reach very far for a clever line for a character to say, preferring to keep everything about the film low-key and unhurried.  The screenplay is by  Kario Salem, Lem Dobbs, Scott Marshall Smith  based on a story by  Daniel E. Taylor, and Kario Salem<br />The film's laid back pace, and lack of flash are on one hand refreshing in a summer full of some of the most god-awful excessive junk like Peal Harbor  or high concept noisy comedies like Cats and Dogs or action movie re-treads like Swordfish and Kiss of the Dragon.<br />DVD STUFF:<br />The Score has been given a good visual and audio transfer by Paramount.  A lot of the film is show with low light and the black levels are strong. The one looks and sounds very good on DVD.<br />There are a few worthwhile extras.

B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie was so hyped up to be a incredible movie and it failed terribly.  Sure it did have some good special effects, but the storyline was terrible.  It was also a slap in the face to Veterans who served in WW2 with its lack of focus on the actual battle.  In addition, it was a terrible portrayal of Pearl Harbor.  <br />The movie should have been titled &quot;Two men fight over a women and fight a battle.&quot;  Never going to watch this movie again.  It was terrible.
B000002UAX|5.0|For the most part, this album is a joke.  What's with these hundreds of reviewers who act as if this album was a serious undertaking?  Come on now.<br /><br />The goofy approach can be nice at times, but in a way it works better on Abbey Road, which also had less of it.  And although part of the White Album's allure is that it is a quilt of weirdness, some of its best songs are the serious ones.. George is especially strong here, with \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Long, Long, Long\\".. John has him out-numbered with \\"Dear Prudence\\", \\"Julia\\", and, although surreal, \\"Cry Baby Cry\\".. and McCartney's only non-corny serious tune (I suppose the performance is more serious than the song) \\"Helter Skelter\\" (perhaps only equaled by his \\"Oh! Darling\\" from Abbey Road) and then the, I admit, beautiful \\"Blackbird\\".  The sad thing is that, despite being a treasure chest of excellent songs, the White Album just has so many weak spots (even if a weak spot on a later Beatles album is still pretty good)..  examples: \\"Glass Onion\\", \\"Wild Honey Pie\\", \\"Me And My Monkey\\", and \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road?\\", all of which nevertheless do have their charm.  However, there is no charm in these: \\"Bungalow Bill\\" (reminiscent of Lennon's absurdist/meaningless short stories and poems), the snoozers \\"Martha My Dear\\" and \\"Mother Nature's Son\\", the immature and blatant (not to mention tacky) Bach rip-off \\"Piggies\\" [if you want a pig song, get \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" by Pink Floyd].  \\"I Will\\" isn't horrible, but it certainly is unnecessary on an overcrowded album.<br /><br />When it comes to musical successes on the weirder side, Lennon is champ, penning \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\", \\"Sexy Sadie\\", and \\"Revolution 9\\", although McCartney does have some contenders (the obvious ones being \\"Back In The USSR\\", \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\", and \\"Rocky Raccoon\\", but \\"Honey Pie\\" is weird in its own catchy kind of way).  It's interesting to notice that of these weirder selections, all of Lennon's have a weightiness that is not found in McCartney's.<br /><br />A warning for those who like to rock, \\"Revolution 1\\" will give you \\"shoe-bee-do-alright\\"s where you expect blazing and blaring guitars (if you know the single version of the song, the b-side to \\"Hey Jude\\" if I'm not mistaken).  I definitely play plain old \\"Revolution\\" more often than \\"Revolution 1\\", but it's clear that the former is too tight a song to fit in on the White Album, and the latter is just right.<br /><br />Ringo pitches in a song of his own, \\"Don't Pass Me By\\", which is fun enough and hops along on its way.  It's a nice little ditty but the album would be just as great without it.  On the other hand, the White Album would be without one of its more perfect songs if George's \\"Savoy Truffle\\" were left off.  It's the catchiest song of his career, and it is an injustice that it is not played often on every old time rock station.  It totally steals the thunder from Van Morrison and his 1971 hit \\"Wild Night\\".<br /><br />Two of the best songs on the album actually kick off disc 2, giving the listener a double dose of energetic guitar rock.  Of the pair, \\"Birthday\\" is more recognizable to the casual fan, but the other, Lennon's masterful \\"Yer Blues\\", could be the greatest blues rock song that any band ever recorded (and Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, Jimi Hendrix, Captain Beefheart, and Led Zeppelin certainly came close).<br /><br />For me, the big grower of the album was the Ringo-sung, Lennon-composed \\"Good Night\\", a heaven-on-earth sweet parting straight from the heart.  It's a strangely calm way to end the most scrambled and wild album the Beatles ever released.not found in McCartney's.

0446677450|1.0|A friend of mine mentioned this book and said to me, &quot;Take a look, it is interesting.&quot;  So I ordered one copy.  With only about 200 pages, I thought I could finish it while flying across the Atlantic Ocean.  Well, I stopped to read after the first hour.  It is poorly written and the author knew it (p. 132).  The organization and story are so awful, it is one of the worst books I have ever read.  I gave it two more tries, and finally forced to the end during another long trip.<br />The whole book can be reduced to 5 pages of explanation plus 5 more for examples.  It can be summarized into one full sentence: &quot;IF YOU WANT TO BE RICH, YOU BETTER BE FINANCIALLY SMART AND BUILD YOUR OWN BUSINESS WHILE WORKING FOR SOMEONE ELSE.&quot;<br />There is no new idea, nor insight, nor wisdom, nor anything inspiring.  Make the mater worse, it contains tons of self-contradicting messages.  For example, it advises not to gamble (p. 124), however, the centrepiece story (p. 29) discouraged a 9-year old boy to understand the risks before making a decision.  It stresses you should mind only the businesses that you love (p. 90), but it disapproves a person's response to the recommendation of &quot;joining a network marketing company to learn sales skills&quot; of saying &quot;I am only want to do what I am interested in (p. 138).&quot;  I can go on and on.<br />So is it worthy my money and time for this book?  On a scale of 1 to 5, 5 the best, it is close to 1, but not quite.  If I have never read similar opinions about our &quot;lack of financial training&quot; school curriculum, and how to &quot;make oneself financially independent,&quot; I am willing to raise the rating to 1.5, but no more.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|An excellent DVD...bought it for our grandson and he is 2 yrs. and we have watched it 45 plus times and still are not tired of it...we still enjoy it and our grand son loves it!  The entire family loves it.  Well animated and put together.
0805062971|5.0|Chuck Palahniuk's dark satire Fight Club will remain on my Top 10 list for many years to come.  Palahniuk's biting satire of post-modern consumer culture provides a dark, intricate plot of violence and manipulation.<BR>    When a disgruntled insomniac finds his life empty and unfulfilling, he begins to find relief in consolation groups like Tuberculosis and Testicular Cancer.  These groups allow him to cry, to let it all out.  Searching for more, he befriends Tyler Durden, and eccentric soap-maker.  When the main character discovers that his apartment has exploded, he has no choice but to room in Tyler's residence.  While together, they become best friends, and together form a consolation group of their own.  They name it Fight Club.  This secret club is comprised of disgruntled laborers and desk jockeys who are fed up with their superimposed, pre-packaged lifestyle.  When the members grow, the club gets bigger, much bigger.<BR>    Palahniuk's intricate plot development is written in a simple, strait forward style.  This, in my opinion, displays the author's philosophy that there is no need for frivolous extras like personification, iambic pentameter, or Swedish-made furniture.  Interlaced with the plot is sharp, sardonic aphorisms criticizing consumer culture and popular culture.  These criticisms fill the plot with conviction and bring the characters, namely Tyler Durden, to life.<BR>    I found this to be one of the best books I have ever read.  I would recommend it to anyone who has at least a sixth grade literacy and anyone who enjoys a good book.
B000059R8Y|4.0|ERIC  yes is one of the best , I love everything he does. I dont think anything will ever get old with him, If you like the eric clapton thing and you feel good to what he is putting out  then listen to Howard Luedtke This man is great , he rocks my world. this man takes it too town  i heard his CD and I was like WOW! why not check it out since you like eric  , listen to howard and get a 2nd shot. wooo hooo  love the howard Luedtke
B000056NX4|5.0|I'm very passionate about theater and therefore very judgemental, but for this show I have nothing but praise.  A good production should make you laugh or cry (or both) and I did a lot of crying towards the end of this one.  Jerome Pradon as Judas takes a little warming to, at first he sounds a bit abrasive, but as the show goes on you realize how essential it is to his character.<BR>Glenn Cater was great as Jesus (with an impressive range), you could really feel the emotional rollercoaster.<BR>The sets were modern, minimal and very effective, the costuming fresh and interesting, just a wonderful production all over.
B00003CXTG|2.0|There are and have been much better war dramas - Tora, Tora, Tora, for example.  The story is primarily about a love triangle that just happens to involve two pilots - but that fact is really unnecessary to the story itself.  The love story itself could have been by and between any three people who happened to be in Hawaii when the Japanese attack took place.  The story wasn't historically accurate but the performances kept it from being a total disaster.  I'd pass on buying this.  If you must - rent it.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I got this CD the day it came out. I was so looking forward to it. Both Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn were so GREAT!! This album makes No Doubt a reggae band. Also, its got an 80's Deborah Harry vibe.  &quot;Hella Good&quot; is so 80's but so electronic..good beat and great opener. &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and more songs are Reggae joints.  I think &quot;hey baby&quot; was a way for No Doubt to get more exposure on Radio..they were shunned with RETURN OF SATURN (AN AWESOME ALBUM). THIS ALBUM IS RADIO FARE.  I like it. I can dance to it..I love the Ballads &quot;Running&quot; has a catchy music box vibe.  BUT IF YOUR A SKA FAN, THIS WILL DISSAPOINT YOU.  &quot;Underneath it All&quot; is cute, very Reggae kind of like a Sublime vs. Bob Marley sound.  Overall, Experience a NEW No Doubt and GET USED TO IT. I think this marks a withdrawal from their SKA roots. GOOD EFFORT AND PRETTY GOOD MARKETING. WIll appeal unfortunately to TRL TEENS. RETURN OF SATURN AND TRAGIC KINGDOM R STILL THE BEST.  THIS RATES 3rd. BUT IS SO LISTENABLE.
0060934913|5.0|Providing a somewhat disturbing look at life in the culinary world, Anthony Bourdain exposes the machinery of a commercial kitchen and the illegal aliens, addicts, and sociopaths that keep it well oiled.<br />This is an engrossing read, one that it hard to put down once it is started.  Unlike most other &quot;food-literature&quot; that I've read recently (&quot;Comfort me with Apples&quot; and &quot;World of Pies&quot;) Bourdain does not provide recipes, or many anecdotes about food.  He is much more concerned with the people who run the business: line cooks, chefs, waitrons, bus-boys, etc.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Clearly it can be said that this film glided right over the head of any person trying to tell you this is \\"an action flick\\", it's not.<br /> Buy it & see if you can't work out what it's really all about, even if you can't you'll still be in for a good action flick.<br /> L
B00004XQ83|5.0|When I saw the movie, I sang every song along aith the characters. Having grown up in the south, I felt right at home with the movie and the soundtrack. THe next day, I ran to buy the CD. I listen to it often. <BR>I recommend it highly to someone who is interested in old-timie bluegrass and/or gospel, southern-style.
6305095442|4.0|This has to be the most idiotic movie I have ever seen. We expected a &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; type zombie flick, but got this sophomoric drivel instead. For this we are grateful, as we still haven't stopped laughing.
B00004TWZK|5.0|Rob Reiner is incredible.  This film is a must see because it showcases his abilities to direct under difficult circumstances.  Working with a cast of teen and preteen can not be the easiest thing to do and all indications are that he pulled it off with ease through incredible casting of child actors.<br />Wil Wheaton is very impressive as Gordie, a boy who is ignored by his parents because he is different and must be challenged by his best friend, Chris.  Chris is played by River Phoenix and the acting job by River is unquestionably Oscar-worthy.  Few child performances are nearly as perfectly done as River's (others that come to mind are Mac Culkin in Home Alone and Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense), but I believe his stands above even those.  Keifer Sutherland plays the antagonist very well... the only misses in the cast may be a couple of the minor players in the older gang.  The younger gang of Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern is well written due to their many differences and the writer/director's (Stephen King/Rob Reiner) willingness to display a full range of emotions in all of them. Richard Dreyfuss funtions well as the narrarator.<br />Stand by Me is one of my two favorite movies of all time and is a definite must see.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|This CD is fantastic. I do miss the days when the release of a new Prince CD was a huge event, yet, the man never ceases to amaze. Despite the speculation, I do not believe Prince has converted to the Jehovah Witnesses. He has always been spiritual in his work, however this time around it's just more evident. However, you don't need to be that way inclined to appreciate this truly beautiful album. It's Jazzy Funk Soul. It really deserves to sell by the truckload, but as we know, Prince doesn't care about sales anymore. (Not that he ever did).<BR>Listen to this album with an open mind and you will surely enjoy it.
6305451591|5.0|This is a very gripping story that deserved the awards it won and was nominated for.  It centers around a Jewish man's journey through Nazi occupation and concentration camp while trying to keep his young son from being traumatized and to keep him alive.  Comedy is wonderfully worked in despite the dark theme and issues involved.  The movie does a good job of presenting the dark side of the concentration camps without dwelling on them or being overly gory.  Best of all, the plot is not very predictible, as it very well could have been.<br />Wonderful directing, above average acting, and incredible writing make for an excellent film that any teenager or older should see.
B00005Q4GA|3.0|Basically my title says it all, this is mainly why the movie was so good. The sets were some of the best I've seen and her toys were even better than some of James Bonds gadgets. She in fact reminded me of a girl James Bond. Her accent is really very good too,, reminded me of Gwyneth Paltrows. The stunts were great and what is really great is that Angelina Jolie did them all without a body double. I really like her fearless energy and it comes across on film as it does in real life. The storyline was not really great and pretty one dimensional with no real subplots and romance was practically nil but what made it a winner was the richness of design and the beauty of Jolie. A worthwhile video to view. <br />Lisa Nary
0792156684|5.0|I caught Part One of this flick last night when it was on NBC.  I had heard a lot of people talking about, and decided to see what the big fuss was about.  So I viewed it, and must say it might be the best film ever made.  I?ll have to wait and see how it comes out before I can decide for sure.  Here is a summary of the part of the plot I know thus far:<br />Some guys name Brock Lovett and Lewis Bondine go on an expedition to a shipwreck to try and find a necklace named ?The Heart of the Ocean?.  They find a safe, but instead of a necklace in it, they find a drawing of an woman wearing the necklace.  They show the drawing on the news, and get a call from an old woman named Rose, claiming to be the lady in the picture.  She then flies out to their ship with her granddaughter Lizzy Calvert and tells them about her adventures on the ship, called the Titanic.<br />As it turns out, her name was Rose DeWitt Bukater and was sailing to America with her mother, Ruth, and fiancee, Cal Hockley.  The only problem is she is not in love with him.  Meanwhile a young man named Jack Dawson and his friend Fabrizio De Rossi win 3rd class tickets on Titanic by playing a game of poker.  Once aboard the ship, Rose decides to kill herself by jumping off the back.  Jack stops her and he is rewarded with a dinner invitation from Cal and his servant, Spicer Lovejoy.  As time goes on, Rose and Jack begin to fall in love and Rose learns that Jack is an artist who likes to draw French girls in the nude.  After Jack has dinner with Rose and her family, he invites her to a 3rd class party.  They both go and have a great time.  Unfortunately, Spicer sees them there and tells Cal, who later confronts Rose violently.  Ruth then confronts Rose, and tells her a family secret: she has to marry Cal because they are out of money.  Jack then tells Rose that she doesn?t love Cal and she believes him.  She then tells Jack to draw her like one of his French girls, and take off her dress.  He then draws her wearing the necklace, Cal gave her.  This is easily the most romantic scene ever filmed.<br />Jack and Rose then find an old car and... (I would tell you what happens, but Amazon would ban it!)  Meanwhile, the ship hits an iceberg and starts to flood.  Cal finds the drawing of Rose and has Spicer take the necklace and put it in Jack?s pocket.  He is framed for robbery and taken away.  Then, the Captain, E.J. Smith, finds out that the ship will sink, and there are not enough lifeboats for all the passengers.<br />This is all of the film I saw and it was great!!!  One complaint: it seemed a bit choppy.  Could this be because it was edited for television?  I shall have to try and find the DVD at my public library so I can find out.  I can?t wait to watch the second installment tonight!  Please stay tuned for my review on Part Two!!!  Love, Peace, and Crabs!!!
B00005AQE8|5.0|This album will undoubtedly remain one of the best rap albums of all time.  Pac rips it on every track, never falling short of excellent.  &quot;Ambitionz Az A Ridah&quot; is a rap anthem and it's highly unfortunate that Fabolous though that he could do the song any justice.  Eyez proves that it has major staying power it is almost always played at any hood party, with everyone their singing the lyrics to every song.  The title track is amazing, with the haunting beat and Pac's exceptional delivery.  &quot;Life Goes On,&quot; &quot;Only God Can Judge Me,&quot; and &quot;Tradin War Stories&quot; let us take a peek a 2Pac's heart, and we found it's one that we related to.  This is a lyrical masterpiece, to be forever remembered and played.
B000056K04|2.0|I recently had a conversation with a friend, and she said she actually wanted to return this CD.  We are both ardent DMB fans, but are quite unhappy with this release.  &quot;Everyday&quot; is a different style of music for the Dave Matthews Band.  Dave plays an electric guitar on a few songs. Carter plays counter-melodies, and all the songs are under 4 minutes.  This CD was produced under the direction of Glen Ballard, and the result is a &quot;pop&quot; sounding CD made for the radio.  I don't fault the band for wanting to try something new, but this CD is just not their best work.<br />The sound on this CD is tightly recorded.  But Boyd Tinsley (Violinist) and LeRoi Moore (Sax/Reeds) are barely playing on this CD.  Their talents are noticeably absent  -- this is a crying shame, since their contributions to the band is what makes them so unique. The worst aspect of this &quot;Everyday&quot; is the poorly written lyrics.  There are not meaningful and lack sincere emotion.<br />Pass on &quot;Everyday&quot; and go for their earlier work.  This CD is not representative of what DMB is known for--long intricate melodies and instrumental solos.  I would recommend that you get a live CD for the best of what DMB has to offer, such as &quot;Listener Supported&quot; or &quot;Live at Red Rocks.&quot;
B00005QGAT|5.0|I honestly didn't think this LP could sound any better, but from the opening notes of &quot;Don't Stop Till You Get Enough&quot; the difference is astounding! The horns blare even more clearly, there's a guitar lick on top of the bass I'd never noticed before, and Michael's sexy falsetto sounds downright miraculous!<br />Every track here, including the early home demos, sounds fantastic. The music, as I've previously stated, is a wonder and set the tone for black pop and Michael's solo career for the next decade and a half.<br />If you haven't listened to &quot;Off The Wall&quot; in a great while, or like me, you've been wearing out your old vinyl and cassette copies for years, give this special edition a spin, you'll be truly amazed at the improved sound quality!<br />A Classic that deserves the &quot;royal treatment&quot;.
B00005QDW1|1.0|dull, bland and unimaginative. I have no problem with a band branching off and trying a new sound. But this is basically 13 or so tracks thrown together with no emotion or inspiration.
006092988X|1.0|The novel, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, was (in my opinion) not insightful, and completely lacked any reality needed to convince the reader of the author's position.<BR> The stories of the protagonist making up the entire novel may be uplifting to some, but those crave action or more reality are in for a snore. Of course, while some books really do a decent job of conveying their message without either of the two, A Tree Grows In Brooklyn not once persuaded me of the author's point of view. <BR>The novel was written in hopes of inspiring people by leaving out most of the details we need to hear to really understand what life in the slums is like. If you do not want to hear those details then read the book; for everyone else, however, I strongly suggest you stay away from A Tree Grows In Brooklyn.
044100590X|5.0|This is an excellent work of sci-fi from the Golden Age.  It is a beautiful combination of philosophy and action.  The planning and the intrugue are the best ever.  When a person can create a world of political manuvering that occurs over millenia and you want to see all of it, it is truly remarkable.  Where The Prince was a theoretical discussion Dune is a practical application.  A work of art.
6303589162|5.0|that this film is intended to be an homage to Hitchcock.  Calling it a rip off is missing the point.  The reason this is such a perfect movie is that Brian DePalma injected his own style and irreverence into the classic Hitchcock shell of suspense and surprize.  The result is a gripping story that captures the sultry essence that is born of that mix of the wealthy and the struggling, the elegant and the raunchy, that can only be found in the hills of L.A.
B00005QDW5|3.0|I was actually in the record store looking for another CD when the bright shiny display containing the new Floyd CD caught my eye.  I purchased the CD on a whim even though I have all of the material elsewhere on CD.  I thought that the remastering, or hearing all of Shine On You Crazy Diamond as one song might be kind of cool.  Instead I have found this collection to be totally redundant and dissapointing at best.  I was displeased by the chopping down of certain tracks from their full length.  Since it is labeled as a greatest hits package, the song choice seems a bit odd.  Marooned-cut down by 2 minutes, who ever heard of this song?(Other than fans).  High Hopes?  I can't even remember ever hearing that song on the radio, and it's not even a good song.  Since they have only 2 disks worth of room, Take it Back would have been a much better choice to represent The Division Bell(it is a better song, and got considerable airplay).  Sorrow is also antother poor choice.  Much better would have been Dogs of War, On The Turning Away,or One Slip.  Fletcher Memorial Home is also a horrible choice for inclusion here.  Another thing I don't particularly like here is that the CD doesn't seem to really flow well, despite the fade-ins and outs.  To me, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts with Floyd.  Each song is relevant to the album on which it was originally released, and they were meant to be played from beginning to end.  When The Tigers Broke Free is a perfect example of this.  In the context of The Wall, the song works,but on this CD as a \\"single\\", it just falls flat.  Maybe Mother or Goodbye Blue Sky would be a better choice.  In all, as a fan of Floyd, I would give this zero stars, since it is a waste of money.  It contains nothing new(or no new versions of old songs), and the digital remastering alone isn't worth (the money), especially since 99% of the material on Echoes is available on digitally remastered CD already.  However, as an introduction to Floyd-I would give it 5 stars(hence my rating of 2.5 stars).  Thirty year old Floyd tunes still have more relevance today than acts like N'Stynk or Britany Spears will have six months from now. <br /> If you are new to the music of Pink Floyd, I would recommend this CD as a starting place.  Or if you're a casual listener who is just looking to pick up something to impress your friends or throw in the CD player at a party, you can't go wrong with Echoes.  If you are a diehard Floyd Fan, your money would be better spent somewhere else!  Maybe a better title for this CD would have been \\"A Young Persons Guide To Pink Floyd\\".
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I just read the review of this CD by Gregg Holycross from South Bend, Indiana, and all I can say is, how can a compilation disc be any better than the #1 songs from the #1 rock band of all time?  GH makes the comment that the quality is poor - hey, in the '60's, almost everyone who heard these songs for the first time heard them on an AM car radio!  (It's like criticizing Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits by saying that his voice is too whiney!) Give me a break - this is an awesome compilation - the quality is great - every song is a classic!
B00003CXZ1|3.0|I thought this movie could be alot worst when I saw previews of it. I think Angelina Jolie was really beautiful in this film. She looks better with a little weight on her. This movie had a terrible script but there were parts of it I liked. Like the begginning. I wouldnt reccomend buying this movie before you rent it.
B00005ATQF|5.0|I was stunned by how well this movie was transformed into the DVD format, and was once again impressed by just what a masterpiece the movie itself remains. Compared critically to the painstaking accuracy and realism portrayed in Oliver Stone's &quot;Platoon&quot; or the larger context of the war Stone provides in &quot;Born On The Fourth Of July&quot;, &quot;Full Metal Jacket' is a failure. Yet, when viewed as an attempt to provide the viewer with an authentic trip into the surrealistic, maddening, and hyper-macho world of Marines in combat, it is a stunning and unforgettable portrait of the futile, horrific, and insane nature of modern warfare.<br />This is in ded a riviting portrait of life lived moment to moment, time stripped of all external meaning, a terrifying voyage into a nightmare world where one kills because one has to kill to stay alive, and to keep one's buddies alive in an effort to live up to the idealized albeit incredibly brutalized notion of what it means to be a Marine.<br />Matthew Modine is superbly cast as a thoughtful and intelligent young man trying to essay his way through the crashing surf of a treacherous and unpredictable tidal wave of blood. Trapped by both naivety and curiosity about manhood, war and life, he enlists in the Marines, soon suffering along with the company of recruits under the merciless resocialization effort called recruit training under a tough and sometimes brutal drill instructor. The violence that results is an introduction to just how successful the training is in indoctrinating callow young men into trained killers. No one misses a beat as the scene suddenly switches to downtown wartime Saigon, and a hooker shashaying her sultry way toward Modine and a buddy.<br />From this point on, the viewer is constantly subjected to an unceasing tirade of the senses, from the crazy, x-rated sick humor of the young men to their stumbling efforts to cope with a situation hopelessly out of control to their attempts to hide their moments of terror and reservations about the insanity they are participating in. The last half hour of the movie is absolutely gripping, and the scenes of combat are enough to make old grunts suffer flashbacks. This movie, directed by Stanley Kubrick and based on a novel called &quot;The Short-Timers&quot;, is a full-tilt look at the maddening excesses of war. I recommend you steer youngsters away from this. In my opinion, it is just too violent, too brutal, and too graphic for them to experience. Otherwise, I recommend it to most grownups as a worthwhile way to get an authentic, if stylized, look at the nature of modern combateir moments of terror and reservations about the insanity they are participating in.

B00005JKGV|5.0|Like the impossible situations in many Borges' short stories, Lost Highway presents an astonishing and uncanny tale in which David Lynch mixes his own obsessions with Hitchcock's Vertigo, Freud's Uncanny, and Bioy Casares' plays with time and space. Close to Borges, Bioy Casares short stories and novels deal with impossible plots where time and space are more related to the character's mind than reality. What is unbereable for Bill Pullman's personage, generates a mad trip to no place. Like in Bioy Casares' El Atajo (the Short cut), the character has to invent a complex net in order to accept his wife is not faithfull to him. Later, he has to accept more difficult things, so the plot responds to that. What makes this film extraordinaty (besides the usual Lightning and Sound excellencies)is the &quot;mirror&quot; structure, derived from the mirror images of Bill Pullman. At the beginning, he is in front of a mirror; later, before a transformation in someone else, he is at the mirror again; but this time, he takes the dark path by the side of the mirror. As a paranoid husband, he wants to be the husband and the lover at the same time. And the plot will pleased him in a strange way. As a mirror of this, Patricia Arquette's character will be doubled, being the wife and the lover of a mobster (Robert Loggia). The question the film tries to answer is: What do you have to do when you can't stand your wife betrayal? In which way you can control the woman you love? Is it really possible to set free the person you obsessively love? At last, like in Vertigo, there is no double (Madelaine and Judy are only one person). In Lost Highway, Lynch doubles the risk and he doubles both characters, the man and the woman. And this sort of Double Vertigo occurs in the placid yet sordid suburban paradise that Lynch has shown in Blue Velvet. <BR>Regarding Sight and Sound, the DVD version is surely able to catch the atmosphere that VHS is not capable of. With some scenes almost completely dark, and with lots of whispers and strange sounds, DVD will show the intensity of this underrated film for those who did not see it at the theaters.
B000050IE6|5.0|The fact that I usually hate death metal vocals but love Opeth is a testament to their brilliance, I think. I am so impressed by this band's unparalleled sophistication, their originality, and the sheer beauty of their music. Most people wouldn't call them progressive metal, reserving such a distinction for a band like Dream Theater or Symphony X. However, Opeth is progressive in every meaning of the word. They are earnestly pushing the boundaries of style with each of their releases. They are entirely unique, blending myriad styles into their complex web of incandescent, ingenious compositions. There's many so-called progressive metal artists (who shall not be named) who seem to say, &quot;Let's throw in random changes and styles to be esoteric and weird.&quot; Opeth's approach, however, seems more discriminating, meshing everything together so naturally and seamlessly without any adverse effect to the music's evocative flow.<br />More than any previous Opeth record, Still Life attains a greater balance between the vocalist Mikael Akerfeldt's aggressive, bowel-wrenching growls and his chilling clean vocals. There is also a wealth of vocal harmonies during these clean sections, supplementing the melody and the vibe. The songs &quot;Benighted&quot; and &quot;Face of Melinda&quot; are delivered entirely with the clean vocals, and they are paralyzing in their beauty. The growling vocals seem more vicious, powerful, and even emotional. Akerfeldt also enunciates extremely well when growling.<br />Just as the variance exists in the vocals, this is one of Opeth's most musically diverse records. The reams of acoustic sections seem more informed by a folk influence than before. The heavier riffing is less brutal than on My Arms, Your Hearse, and tends to be more melodic. I think I heard a bit of a Rush (!) influence on &quot;Moonlapse Vertigo.&quot; The average song length is about nine minutes, and involves many unpredictable changes between the heavy sections and the acoustic passages. &quot;Benighted&quot; is the &quot;simplest&quot; song on the album, relying on the acoustic guitar throughout (though the solo is on electric), but it's absolutely exquisite. The opening track, &quot;The Moor,&quot; is 11 minutes of such striking dynamics it scares me. It begins with a lengthy introduction of haunting guitar creating a haunting atmosphere. Then, after a brief-but-stunning acoustic section, the vengeful heaviness crashes through the ambiance. &quot;Serenity Painted Death,&quot; with its tuneful riffing, creates a groove so infectious it could hook almost anybody. &quot;Face of Melinda&quot; is one of the band's finest songwriting moments, being largely acoustic but building to a crippling electric finale. The sheer punctilious fullness of Still Life is almost intimidating, but it ensures long-term appeal. I was blown away on the first spin, but it takes indefinite listens to grasp its magnitude.<br />Like My Arms, Your Hearse, Still Life is a concept album with a somewhat nebulous story. Akerfeldt is telling the tale of an exiled man, who returns to his home after fifteen years to find the woman he loved. It's a powerful, but tragic, love story. I'm pretty sure I get the gist of it, but I must confess that the poetry is extremely complex and not always easy to understand. This challenge, however, highlights the intelligence of Akerfeldt's lyrics. Very rarely does a Swedish band offer such brilliant poetry in English. There is some brilliant imagery and diction here, especially on the harrowing opener &quot;The Moor&quot; and the gruesome &quot;Serenity Painted Death.&quot; &quot;Benighted&quot; has pleasant -- almost romantic -- lyrics.<br />The word &quot;masterpiece&quot; is tossed around rather carelessly, it seems. It is a title that should be reserved for albums such as this. For 62 minutes and 7 songs, your world belongs to Opeth.ustic passages. &quot;Benighted&quot; is the &quot;simplest&quot; song on the album, relying on the acoustic guitar throughout (though the solo is on electric), but it's absolutely exquisite.

B000002UB6|5.0|I remember first purchasing Let it Be a few months ago. It was the only Beatles album I did not own and since I am a completist I thought I'd give it a try. The reason I use such a self-important tone in the prior sentence is because I was on guard; on guard against an album which has been critically panned, unjustly critically panned. I don't know what album the critics were listening to but the one I bought was overwhelmingly beautiful from track one all the way through to the end. <br />Two of Us - A beautiful song, it plays both muscially and lyrically like a quiet conversation between two people who are madly in love with one another. Since Lennon and McCartney actually co-wrote and worked lead together here, this is exactly what it is. <br />Dig A Pony - Classic Lennon. Dig a Pony has the same obsessive quality as Abbey Road's &quot;She's So Heavy&quot;, however, this song is somewhat more melodic and lighter in tone. A joy to listen to, especially John's voice when he hits the chorus.<br />Across the Universe - This song has the distinction of being the only song in the Beatles' catalogue that can bring me to tears. I can't help but think of Lennon's senseless murder everytime I hear it. Phil Spector's production lends itself beautifully here. <br />I Me Mine - Further proof that George Harrison was on the same song-writing level as John and Paul by the end of the Beatles' run. For a song that clocks in at only 2:25, it is the most epic, sweeping song on the album. Simple yet poignant. <br />Dig It - A fun little, random Lennonian intermission. I heard there is a longer version of it floating around out there somewhere.<br />Let It Be - Paul harkens back to his childhood love of hyms on this track. As much of a message to his departed mother as it is religious. This song is slightly marred by Spector's embelishment, however, it still stands as one of the greatest and well-known songs in the Beatles catalogue.<br />Maggie Mae - Another fun tongue-in-cheek intermission.<br />I've Got a Feeling - John and Paul work together on this one once again, however, the song feels more McCartney than Lennon. The best way to sum this song up is to call it the perfect camp-fire song. Although very folky, it can be raucous at times as well. Somebody get the marshies out.<br />One After 909 - One of my least favorites, it sounds like generic, watered down rock and roll. Still, I am in no position to criticize, I'm just offering my opinion.<br />TLAWR - I love the all-too pertinent lyrics and I love the piano work but I can't past the unnescessary orchestration Phil Spector chose to use here. From what I hear, Paul was outraged after hearing Spector's overdubs. I can see why, this song sounds like a show tune on depressants.<br />For You Blue - Another Harrison gem. On For You Blue we get to hear some great slide guitar work from George, which he would later showcase on his first solo album, All Things Must Pass. Funky blues, I especially like when George quips &quot;Elmore James' got nothing on this fellow'&quot;. Probably the most fun song on the album. <br />Get Back - Ah, the rooftop version of the classic, veiled stab at John Lennon and Yoko Ono from Paul McCartney. This song personifies what Let it Be was all about, an attempt from the boys to get back to their Rock N' Roll roots after years of sonic experimentation and egotistical fragmentation. This song features great piano work from Billy Preston. <br />Please, I recommend you look past the way-below average rating users have given this album and give it a try. It's loads of fun. If you liked the opinions put forth in this review, check out my Greatest Albums of Rock lists in the Listmania section. There are some treasures there as well. Thank God for Rock N' Roll.
0767802519|5.0|I dont write reviews too often so ill be briefI do say first off that this is not a movie to be missed. The action is breath taking and the plot is fantasticlly better than what I expected.<BR>Though not everyone will approve of someof the sequences it is still worth a view if your a hardcore person who is into killing a crapload of people
B00005QDW1|3.0|This album isn't really what I've come to expect from No Doubt. Unlike a lot of critics and the record buying public, I thought their last studio album &quot;Return to Saturn&quot; was their best--I still do. <br />There are some bright spots on &quot;Rock Steady&quot; : &quot;Hey Baby&quot; grew on me after about three listens; &quot;Underneth it All&quot; has a dancehall/ska vibe to it that's pretty infectious and well done; ditto for &quot;Start the Fire&quot; &amp; &quot;In My Head&quot; which are upbeat pleasurable tracks. The rest of the CD, is a little too much of a throwback to 1980's synth-poprock with some tracks using only keyboards and no real intruments. The &quot;Hella Good&quot; track is the worst ND has ever recorded. Gwen's heavy breathing over parts of the refrain remind me of Titney's awful &quot;Slave 4 U.&quot;<br />Gwen's voice may be an irritant to some but I found that it has matured nicely and she's moved away from the shrill nasal sound that worked so well on No Doubts second CD. <br />This isn't in my 2001 Top 10 disks but it's still a good disk.
038532653X|5.0|Skellig is a great book by a great author called David Almond. This adventurous book is full of vivid writing which helps the story flow smoothly. Adventures and mysteries are what lie behind the cover of Skellig. Skellig is a really, really, really good book for ages 9 and up. Way to go David Almond you wrote a great book that many people love to read.
0783225970|4.0|Fine acting, fine plot, great cast of characters and pretty friggen' violent. That combo is the formula for an entertaining movie, but when an ending is as overdone as it is in Scarface, I have to be critical. I don't want to reveal much, but let me tell you now, if you watch it all the way through, be prepared for a wild ride of excessive violence and mayhem. Pacino's shootout could have been a little shorter and more realistic. He had over 50 guys shooting at him at the same time, and the only time he got hit was when the arch rival shot him in the back! The chainsaw scene was a little extreme for sensitive viewers, but I feel that it was neccisary. All-in-all, it is a good film that shows the harmful truth about the life that crime and murder will provide in shockingly grotesque and extreme detail. Good to rent, or if you are a big Al Pacino fan, buy. PS, if I could, I would give it 4 and a half stars.
B0000524CY|5.0|I love this movie from beginning to end. There are slow parts in the film, but like a roller coaster, it climbs slow and when it gets to the top it just blasts off and takes you on quite a ride. Well acted with some pretty damn believable special effects. Love the Regan character played by Linda Blair. I can't believe there are people who have never seen this movie still. Anyway I offer a HIGH recommendation for this one. Remember to hold on to your hats!
0451191153|3.0|I would not recommend Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead to anyone looking for the remotest form of suspense.  The reader is kept waiting for 700 pages for some sort of climax which never materializes.  The plot is based on archetitcure and one man's journey in life told through this perspective.  I could not relate to this book at all because of this.  <BR>The novel is supposed to have the hidden morals of life, and it does to some extent.  Ayn Rand does a beautiful job developing her characters.  The reader can see different aspects of society through each different character and their interactions with others.   I, however, could not personally relate to any one of these characters.  This hinders my perception and opinion of the novel.  <BR>Overall, The Fountainhead is a wonderfully written novel which was very planned and thought out before Ayn Rand began the writing of the actual novel.  I would recommend this novel to anyone who has enough time to read large novels and who doesn't mind the lack of suspense found in this novel.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|I could easily give this film 5 stars. I didn't hate it and I didn't like it. I love horror and comedy. I never liked serious movies about the tragedies of life and I despise depressing. This movie was DEPRESSING! I am talking...it grabs you by the eyeballs and drags you 150mph into a world you'd rather not ever visit and leaves you there. It was also just a plain old damn good movie too. The actors were believable and the filmwork was superb. I felt like I was thrust into the minds of the druggies and it wasn't fun. Ellen Burstyn...my god...what an actress. I loved/hated seeing the deterioration of that poor woman. Bottom line...I had to watch the Exorcist right after this just to feel clean!
B00005O5JV|3.0|Barbie gets a brain transplant and a new hot pink wardrobe. And, oh yes, goes off to Harvard Law Scool in pursuit of an ungrateful yuppie boyfriend. After the first ten minutes the remainder becomes transparently predictable, but never boring, thanks to Reese Witherspoon who grins winningly through thick and thin. Critiquing a movie like this is pointless. Like cotton candy and Disneyland, it exists in a world of its own with little or no relation to reality. I would have liked the result better had the stereotypes not been crafted by the numbers, as though political correctness can suffice for social conscience. It can't, not even when promoting the worthy cause of feminist empowerment. And somebody should be slapped hard for slotting in the manicurist in such condescending style. Still, pretty, perky Witherspoon glows, making this saccharine bon-bon an easy if lumpy swallow.
B00003CXTG|2.0|This is one of those films that's able to trivialize even the most earth-shaking historical events.  True that the attack sequences are quite good (though they should have relied more on the ILM effects instead of using some very modern-looking mothballed Navy ships as props), but by intertwining a predictable, sappy love-triangle, the action is seriously blunted.<br />The film is tortuously long, largely due to the &quot;human interest&quot;<BR>element that is neither interesting nor very believably human.  Could the writers not have come up with something that's just a bit less of a cliche than a love triangle?  Of course, moviegoers who long for mental, as well as edible popcorn, will no doubt &quot;eat it up&quot;.<br />I'm reminded of Shakespeare: &quot;...a tale, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.&quot;
0440178002|5.0|When I first read this book I thought it would be some old wind bag going on for over a 1,000 pages, about what people ate for breakfast or what colour there toenails where, I was so very, very wrong.<BR>Tose first pages had me hooked. I remember sitting down at 10:30am and what seemed like minutes were infact 12 hours, I read the entire book in one day.<BR>I didn't eat anything that day, but forfilled me, I've it so many times I've lost count.<BR>In my opinion everyone should read this, when I saw the mini-series this year on tape, it really let down the book. It should be remaid, so that the memory of the James Clavell is remembed by even tose who perfer not to read.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I got to see John perform in a very small club in my area--just him and an acoustic guitar.  He was amazing!  And his early CD's didn't have the studio band behind him and they were unpolished and still great.  &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; is one of the sexiext songs ever.  I highly recommend this CD to anybody!
B0000025P9|4.0|Back when I was in 4th grade in a time when the state of California actually supported music and arts in the public schools, this piano playing dude Mr Dubin used to drop by once a week to teach us a song or two. Along with a arm-waving Ebony and Ivory rendition, he got us going loud and proud with Toto's Africa.<br />He started with the piano pounding:<BR>Bownanow na now na now <BR>doodle-oodle doodle-oodle doodle-oodle doodle-oodle<BR>Bownanow na now na now <BR>doodle-oodle doodle-oodle doodle-oodle doodle-oodle<br />So imagine a classroom full of kids going from the laid-back opening lines and then exploding to the big, &quot;I bless the rains down in Africa!&quot;<br />Doesn't get much better than that. Plus, I learned all about Kilamanjaro. <br />So California...cut the football team, leave the music class alone! (or bring back the slush property taxes! hehehe)
B000003TA4|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever recorded, and the best album that I own. Nirvana is my favorite band of all time, and they will be one of yours too if you listen to Nevermind. This is an album that you listen to from start to finish without skipping any songs.  <br />You can hear songs from this album on any rock or alternative rock station in the country. This is the album that Nirvana gained their notoriety from, and it was well deserved. It has a simplicity to it that is easy to like, and pleasing to the ears. Once you get past listening to the great lyrics, the music itself is wonderful. Kurt's guitar playing is well placed, mixed in with Krist's heavy bass riffs and Dave Grohl's awesome drumming.<br />The songs have great structure for any rock type songs. The best part of this album is where the songs themselves are placed on the album. From the raw, anti-anthemic Smells Like Teen Spirit, to the slow, soft sound of Something in the Way, the album doesn't let down. In the 10 songs between, the songs range from the fast and rough sound of Breed, to the always great Drain You.<br />Buy this album today, and you won't be disappointed. Just make sure you allow the hour it takes to listen to it all the way through.
B00005N53P|5.0|I admit that I jumped on the Stroke-wagon a little late but I'm glad I climbed aboard. I really appreciate albums without filler. &quot;Is This It&quot; is just that, strong all that way through. The walking basslines of the title track mesh perfectly with Julian's vocals. The beginning of &quot;Last Night&quot; will remind you immediatley of &quot;American Girl&quot; by Tom Petty but comes into it's own after the first few bars. Throwing down a few more ducats gets you the original album artwork which was banned in the US (the whole situation is very reminiscent of Spinal Tap's &quot;Smell the Glove&quot;, STRANGE), and the song &quot;NYC Cops&quot;, which was left off the US release after the WTC 9/11. This song is the most &quot;punk&quot; on the CD.  Aside from the multitude of 70s band comparisons (Television), if you like good, bar band rock this IS it.
B000002HHB|3.0|She has a wonderful and haunting voice and there are a couple of very nice songs, but most of the songs are a bit too sparse and simple for my taste.
B000009QPE|5.0|Personally - I MUST say I'm not a huge Slayer fan. They're too....umm...controversial and have too many hate lyrics and are anti-semitic and stuff. But then again, I am a huge metal fan, and this is one of my metal favourites. It's a METAL masterpiece (not to be confused with a real masterpiece) and is a must buy for any fan of hardcore metal with fast, low guitars, crazy snare drum and angst-ridden lyrics.
B00005ATQD|4.0|The DVD (purple box) is good. Although selling the Standard Screen as &quot;the Director's Vision&quot; seems lame to me, ...why aren't all DVDs Widescreen by default anyway? Also, the DVD version is still &quot;cencored&quot; to the &quot;American Version&quot; of the film. Since it's the only version that I have had the opportunity to see, I cannot state what exactly is cencored, nor by what means (although there is plenty of speculation out there). If you like the film, buy this DVD, it's a good quality DVD. (Personally, I feel that Eyes is a step-up from Kubrick's most disatisfying film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; so for that reason, I enjoy it - although it's a far cry from 2001 or Dr Strangelove!
6304233639|3.0|This 1996 films is, of course, for pure entertainment. In that respect, it definitley succeeds. Story wise, it leaves much to desire. The movie is perfectly made, with eye popping effects, and a golden cast. But, it is no longer easy to watch because of certain scenes. I think you know why. Is it enough to bash a film and give it one star?. Well, that'a a topic for a debate. I don't know myself. There are a few stupid things here. The President, played by Bill Pullman, decides to go up in the air to fight the aliens too?. Come on. He says &quot;My place is up in the sky&quot;, or something like that. Give me a break. They'd have him underground in a bunker or something. That was pure hokeyness if ever there was any. Will Smith turne into a real capable, and heroic leading man with this film. That star dimmed however, with &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. This obviously isn't a film meant for Oscar consideration. It's just a fun ride designed to make going to the movies fun. It was definitley fun. It runs way too long, and is filled with too much unneeded stuff tho. The nasty review at the bottom of the page is ridiculous. It goes way out of proportion with untrue sayings that are obviously said to just satisfy whoever wrote it.
B00005OM4N|3.0|I felt that this album was mostly good and showed experimental devices with her musical techniques and voice.The best songs i felt from this album were i'm a slave for u, overprotected,lonely,cinderella, bombastic love and what it's like to be me. Although some of the songs do sound alike they were still good and enjoyable to listen to. her song -  what it's like to be me, justin timberlake and wade robson (nsync's choreographer) produced this record and placed backing vocals on it as well. You can definately hear the influence of these 2 guys as they produced n sync's smash hit single POP and the influence shines out in Britney's song. I would personally recommend u buy this album.
B0000509C3|1.0|This is corny as hell. Pardon the pun. Who the hell could call this a great, scary horror film and still keep a straight face when they call themselves horror fans?. This is stomach churning drivel. So god awful is it, that you just wonder what Stephen King thought when he saw this monstrosity. The acting is of high disgust caliber. The effects and make-up are cheesy and half cocked. The score was lame and the kids were terrible. One of the worst of all time. If you think this is great, you must be one of the brainwashed kids. This film should never of been made.
0393317552|3.0|What Jared Diamond really needs this Christmas (or Hannukah, as the case may be) is a ghost writer. Jesus Christ Almighty is he dull--with the exception of the chapter on the Spanish defeat of the Incan Atahualpa. Properly rewritten, there's enough material here for a cover article in the Atlantic magazine. His rhetorical outline is straight out of Composition 101: first he tells ya what he's gonna tell ya, then he tells ya, then he tells ya what he's told you. If you found the previous sentence tedious and unoriginal, imagine it writ large over 440 pages. He follows this rhetorical pattern not just in every chapter, but in every subunit of every chapter. It's as if he feels obligated to repeat the material so often that readers will be incapable of misunderstanding or forgetting it.
B000002J2B|3.0|Although I like Wind &amp; Wuthering, their second post-Gabriel album with Phil Collins on lead vocals, it's hard for me to listen to it knowing the direction they began to take the minute Gabriel left and Collins took over. To me, this album has a bittersweet quality to it.<br />The music still has that multi-layered, odd-time signature quirkiness inherent with progressive rock (although with each album subsequent to Lamb Lies Down on Broadway they became less and less quirky and more &quot;accessible&quot; to the masses), yet it's apparent they're evolving into something entirely different from what they were on Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot and Selling England By the Pound.<br />For my money, this is the last &quot;progressive rock-like&quot; album they recorded. The follow-up studio effort (And Then There Were Three...) almost totally cast aside any pretense of prog rock and moved boldly into the realm of commercialism.<br />But that's another year away. And sandwiched in between is one of the most important live albums ever recorded.<br />W&amp;W begins with an upbeat proggy tune called &quot;Eleventh Earl of Mar.&quot; Great build-up. Nice driving beat. Sounds like the Genesis of old.<br />&quot;One For the Vine,&quot; however, is an immediate downturn. Lots of nice melodic guitar and piano work (and a quirky instrumental break 4:40 minutes into it), but the song never really grabs me.<br />&quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; follows and bums me out even more. A low-key love song -- one of many, many more Phil Collins would unleash on the world in the years to come. Yuck.<br />&quot;Wot Gorilla?&quot; (track 4) brings back some powerful instrumental work. Very catchy, with lots of bass pedal work, keyboard flourishes and uptempo drumming. Unfortunately, Steve Hackett's guitar seems buried beneath layers and layers of synths (no wonder he left after this album!).<br />Track five (&quot;All in a Mouse's Night&quot;) is a track that sounds like it would have fit perfectlyon A Trick of the Tail. It's a clever story about a &quot;Loving Couple&quot; a &quot;Mouse&quot; and a &quot;Cat.&quot; (The mouse loses.)<br />Steve Hackett's classical guitar mastery comes to the forefront on &quot;Blood on the Rooftops,&quot; a sorely-needed showcase for Hackett amidst a nearly total Tony Banks-flavored album. It's a lively piece of music that I like very much. (Even when Phil Collins -- whom I never really warmed to -- begins to sing.)<br />The last three tracks (&quot;Unquiet Slumbers For the Sleepers...&quot;, &quot;...in That Quiet Earth&quot; and &quot;Afterglow&quot;) are brilliant, especially &quot;Afterglow.&quot; Great musicianship, and even Phil Collins' vocals on &quot;Afterglow&quot; are excellent.<br />Overall, Wind &amp; Wuthering is a very nice album, worthy of having in your Genesis collection. It's not as good as others in their catalog (with Gabriel), but it's a whole lot better than most in their post-Gabriel -- especially everything they recorded after 1980.
B00003CXTG|4.0|No, it's not a great film, but it's a lot better than some would have you believe. Essentially, it's a 1940's style war film interspersed with 2001 special effects (like explosions). This means patriotic verbal expressions and images, and a less than obsessive sense of historical accuracy. But (despite the marketing) that isn't the film's point. It's a romantic fantasy and a very good one at that. If you expect more from it, then you'll be disappointed in it. But I don't think this is a fault with the film. It's the fault of the expectations we bring to it, and a brow-beating marketing campaign. If you want to compare it to something, compare it to &quot;From Here to Eternity.&quot; It's in that genre of films.  While not a great film, it is certainly a good, entertaining one. And for a long movie (183 minutes), it flies by very quickly.<br />Oh, and relative to the other DVD blockbuster movies this year (like Phantom Menace and Planet of the Apes), this is the hands down winner. At least you'll stay awake.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I've seen this movie several times on TV and i never thought of it as being one of the better trek films, but the new director's cut DVD version has raised the status of this film in my eyes. The new effects added to the feature are designed to look spectacular but also to look like they could have been produced during the time of the original production. The new visuals, along with a snappier cut of the original footage, give this film the grand cosmic scale it should have had from the start.
0553260111|5.0|I promised I'd read The Bourne Identity after having seen the trailer starring Matt Damon in next year's movie by the same name.  When I realized that Robert Ludlum had written the original book in 1980, I went to the library to pick up a copy.  There's a similarity between the leading characters in Robert Ludlum's books.  They're usually male, headstrong (and ultimately always the good guy), determined and they fall for a girl that complements the guy in some way.  <br />A couple of persnickety points I have to mention in my reviews(as always):  I found it irritating the way Marie St. Jacques (the leading lady) speaks to Jason Bourne.  She uses &quot;Darling&quot; a lot and her speech seems somewhat formal and affected.  The author also uses italics to indicate what's going on in a character's mind from time to time.  The recurring themes in this book are: be a sponge (because you've got amnesia), move! (because you're being hunted), don't kill if you don't have to (because deep down you're actually a good guy - a govt. guy).  But sometimes, it just feels redundant and tedious to read.  The first Ludlum book I've read is the recent bestseller The Sigma Protocol.  I rated and reviewed that book on Amazon as well.  In my review I ended by saying the author got preachy towards the end to do some last minute plot explanation before ending the book.  I see a slight hint of that in this book as well.  <br />Some good points to consider are: It is my opinion that the author makes improvements to the style and tone of the sequel to this book called The Bourne Supremacy (which I liked better).  I found it more action packed and rythmic.  (The fact that I had spent most of my childhood summers in Hong Kong also helped.)  I also enjoy his usage of local dialect interspersed in the characters' speech to give color and that authentic feel to the characters in his books.  (Turns out he's been using this technique for the past 20+ years.  You still see it in his latest novel TheSigma Protocol.)<br />If I had to give a more precise rating for this book, I'd rate it a 4.5.  I'm saving the higher ration of 5.0 for The Bourne Supremacy, which I'll write a review for next.  Stay tuned.
B000059H98|5.0|P-p-p-POW!  Lori Petty is such a talented actress, as is Naomi Watts. For people who dislike it so very much and don't appreciate the visuals-- it's based on a comic book, you idiot!<BR>It is highly imaginative, humorous and entertaining.  That's kinda the point here, eh?  No brain surgery. <BR>Besides-- we girls need more films like this one where the women kick the crap out of the stupid, evil men who are trying to destroy everything in order to make money and show how &quot;manly&quot; they are.  No more stupid puffalls guys-- deal with it!
0399230033|5.0|My 10-month-old daughter demands her father and I read only Peggy Rathman books to her before bedtime.  Since she was 5 months old, she would choose Goodnight, Gorilla from a pile of books offered to her, even if I hid this book on the bottom of the stack.  I have decided that, unlike most baby board books, Peggy Rathman stories have a climax to look forward to -- whether it is yelling &quot;BEDTIME&quot; in Ten Minutes 'Til Bedtime or gasping when the zookeeper's wife realizes there are a bunch of zoo animals in her bedroom in Goodnight, Gorilla.  The illustrations keep me interested, night after night.  The attention to detail is wonderful.  I highly recommend her books, and wish she would write more!
0743216458|5.0|Many readers were introduced to Stephen Ambrose's characteristic style of writing in books such as CITIZEN SOLDIERS or D-DAY, a style that weds together riveting, factual battlefield history with the personal and compelling accounts of those that lived and fought through it.  That style comes out again in BAND OF BROTHERS.  But readers are allowed to become better acquainted with this book's subjects because Ambrose places the entire focus of the book on the men from one particular company (E or Easy company), from one particular regiment (506th), from one particular division (101st Airborne).  Readers become interested and involved in the lives of the men from Easy Co.  They root for them in battle.  They cheer for them in victory, and they mourn with them in defeat ot retreat.  Every unit history should be this detailed, moving, and vivid.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I have never seen a childs face light up like my daughters when she watches this movie.  It is funny and it teaches a great lesson on how not to judge others by their appearances. We enjoy watching it as a family and laughing together.  It is a must have for movie buffs!!!  Congrats Dreamworks on a job well done!!!
630382790X|5.0|Loosely based on Astronaut Jim Lovell's written account, LOST MOON, the film follows the crew of Apollo 13 from pre-flight controversy, to in-flight catastrophe, to post-flight exhilaration and reflection.  I found the film suprisingly enthralling because I speculated that a film about three guys in a tiny metal capsule was not likely to hold my notoriously short attention.  However, meticulous direction by Ron Howard, coupled with solid cast performances by Tom Hanks, Gary Senise, Bill Paxton, and Ed Harris, just to name a few, gave the film a rapidly rolling storyline.
0393312836|5.0|The most famous and one of the most brilliant novels writen by English author, Anthony Burgess.  A masterpiece of psychological evaluation, linguistics and satire.<br />The work chronicles the &quot;near future&quot; as seen by Burgess, where he creates a new form of slang and language for his characters and masterminds a dark reality in the vain of &quot;1984,&quot; &quot;Brave New World&quot; and similar stories.  Yet there is not just the forewarnings of doom seen in the writings of other dark future writers, but also a slightly hidden but wonderful sense of wit and humor.<br />In the American re-edition called the intro &quot;A Clockwork Orange Resucked&quot; and complained bitterly about what Kubrick did with the movie.  More likely than not he was proud but just angry with Kubrick's leaving out the final chapter of the book, as he mentions.<br />Burgess looks at the darkest impulses of humanity, and the out of control attempts that society goes to in order to rectify and &quot;cure&quot; the social deviants.  This is not just a dark future, but also a warning to us about the course that our reform programs seem to be heading towards.<br />Gritty, dark, somber and somehow always cleaver, this mini novel is a must read for everyone.  Burgess flourishes with his mastery of how language works and employs his gifts as a linguist to bring out a colorful sub-culture lingo that has evolved (within the context of the book) from the reasonable and normal perversions of every day speech to the language.<br />Burgess said that there were other books that he would rather have been remembered for.  &quot;A CLockwork Orange&quot; brings modern readers to the late Burgess' prose and leaves us interested to go on and see some of the wealth that inhabits the rest of his writing.
0440539811|5.0|This is a fantastic book, but those who come to it with any expectations whatsoever are bound to be disappointed.  The Illuminatus Trilogy is not so much a book as a literary psychology test, designed to diagnose the intellectual and psychological limits of the reader.  As such, it's a different book depending on who's reading, so if you're reading my review for advice before buying, you've already identified yourself as someone who's mind will likely be blown by the mix of gurellia ontology, quantum mechanics, ritual magic, conspiracy theory, and wonderfully obscure humor.  If, however, you got this far into my review, and are still reading-buy the book, you're more the type to be blown away by the sex/drugs/rock and roll aspect.  If you're STILL reading this review, you've likely already read Illuminatus!, and are just checking out the reveiws for your own amusement.  Still there? Good-start buying copies for unenlightened strangers, George W. Bush, and others who need a rapid reorganization of neural functions. Enjoy!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|In a previous review, somebody said thay gave this movie 2 stars because there was no representation of good in the movie.<br />What does that have to do with anything?<br />This is a well made, well acted, suspensful movie with an interesting story.  Okay, so the characters don't end up giving each other hugs and kisses at the end.  So what?  It's a great movie that holds your attention for almost 2 hours.<br />I hate movies that assumes the audience is stupid.  Nothing worse than a movie that spoon feeds you whats going on, and this one doesn't.  Sure, some people won't be able to follow what's going on, and that's too bad for them, but this is a great movie.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|When I saw the ads for Moulin Rouge, I thought, &quot;Oh, that is just another over done movie-musical.&quot; After it came out in theaters, a friend convinced me to see it. From the opening scene, I was on the edge of my seat. The plot kept me on my toes and entrapped in the boheimian world love, lust and sex. Nicole Kidman and Ewen McGregor did outstand jobs in both acting and singing. Although the end was not very suprising (I won't give it away for those who have not seen the movie.) because of the opening scene, I cryed. This is a feat in and of itself, becuase I never, ever cry durning movies. I will say that anyone who has ever thought about seeing this movie should. And those that haven't thought about seeing it, well maybe they should.
B00004VWA7|5.0|If you don't already have a copy!It's so much better these days to see Jaco's music and liturature displayed on the web(as well as his picture) as seen on Amazon.com and others.I can only hope that future generations of talented young musicians will tap into his stregth and vigor; to make valid his insidiouis and highly powerful thoughtfullness that went into the making of this album and the rest that follows.WHO LOVES YOU JACO!!!!!

B00003CXXS|1.0|Let's face it. This is a big budget television movie. Everything except the dinosaurs is second string.<BR>Weak script...banal dialog...William Macy is on autopilot throughout this film. Neil drifts in and out of his New Zealand accent. <BR>The overwrought score tries to bring emotion to the flat storyline but ultimately feels like it came from a needledrop library. <BR>The ending is horrible....just horrible.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Save your money folks. This movie rates at the bottom of all the movies I have seen in quite a while. It appears that even the people making this movie realized how bad this movie was and decided to aim the camera more at her nice figure rather than try to make the movie any good. Nice graphics if you like video games. Go out and play Unreal Tournament if that is what you are looking for.
B00004R99L|4.0|It is a little dated and overly familiar, but still just as wonderful as you remember it.  Really worth watching again.
B00005BCPC|5.0|I didn't read the book so I guess I enjoyed it more. I can't believe that people gave such bad reviews for MANSFIELD PARK because it was really captivating. The dialogue drew me in and the characters were so interesting. Especially that brother and sister. I forgot the brother's name but I remember the sister's name was Mary. <br />I liked Fanny Price because of her sharp wit and I remember this line from the video. Susie, Fanny's sister said that &quot;Your tongue is as sharp as a gullitine.&quot; I agree, although I wish that Fanny would stand up more for herself because she was pushed around by Mrs. Norris. <br />It was sort of confusing and I got the characters mixed up, but other than that, I really enjoyed the video. I recommend that people should watch the video and then read the book because the book seems to destroy the fun of the video. I think I would read the book and compare the two and who know's? Maybe after reading &quot;the real version,&quot; I would find this video to be garbage. But for the present, I think everyone should watch the video of Mansfield Park because it was simply delightful!
B00003CXTF|5.0|OK PEOPLE! HERE'S THE DEAL. WHO EVER USES THE WEAK EXCUSE THAT THIS MOVIE IS TOO FOCUSED ON THE &quot;LITTLE LOVE TRIANGLE&quot; INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL EVENT (AND I HAVE A FEELING MOST PEOPLE WHO GAVE IT LESS THAN 5 STARS USED THAT STUPID EXCUSE)... HERE'S A NEWS FLASH: IF THE FRIGGIN MOVIE WOULDNT HAVE HAVE THE LOVE STORY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A HISTORY/DISCOVERY/NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC CHANNEL DOCUMENTARY! DUH! DOESN'T ANYONE REALIZE THAT? IT NEEDS SOME SPICE! AFTER ALL IF THE MOVIE IS JUST ON THE ATTACK IT WOULD NOT BE INTERESTING AT ALL AND WOULD EVEN BE TOO SHORT TO EVEN BE IN THEATRES. NOW I HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT THE 45 MINUTE ATTACK WAS EXAGGERATED. NOW LET ME SEE... A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE IN THE 21ST CENTURY WITH BAD SPECIAL EFFECTS? I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THE MORE EXAGGERATED AND BOMBS, FLASHES, EXPLOSIONS, ETC. THE MOVIE HAS... THE BETTER IT IS! I THINK THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE THIS YEAR!
6305075379|1.0|It is unfortunate that this film was ever DUBBED. It is not as though Aussies speak another language and Yanks aren't intelligent enough to work some the careful crafted slang in this classic.<BR>Fortunate now there is a new UNDUBBED version due for release this mouth, with more features and CHEAPER.<BR>I'm selling my old DUBBED copy and buying the new UNDUBBED version.
B000002A46|5.0|Mariah does an amazing job with this album, setting the standard for later Christmas releases by Celine Dion, Michael Bolten, Destiny's Child, and Toni Braxton.<br />From the bouncy, spirited &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot; to the soulful rendition of &quot;O Holy Night&quot; Mariah offers up classics and new true-to-the-season songs with her stunning voice.<br />You won't find a better Christmas album, i guarantee it!
B00005R2IS|5.0|Yes finally the UNDUBBED version on DVD, with more features and CHEAPER than the older DUBBED version. How was ever possible that this classic was DUBBED for American audience I don't know. May be the old DUBBED version will become a classic collectors item because the DUBBING is so bad.<BR>I'm buying this version and selling old junk DUBBED version.
B00005B36H|1.0|I used to worship these guys about 5 years ago. I was a tool freak. No one had any idea who they were...people would come up to me and be like &quot;why are you wearing a shirt that says TOOL on it??&quot; and laugh. Anyways, that was back when they had 2 incredible albums: Opiate, Undertow. Undertow was like my bible. So what about Tool now? They've slowed down, done way too much acid for their own good and it hurts their music. I would have given this overrated album 2 stars because it has a few moments i enjoys but overall i found it incredibly hard to sit through the whole thing without getting bored(espiecally past track 10). Anyways i took away that 2nd star because i was unfortuante enough to waste money to see them on the tour for this album and they completely IGNORED the fact that they had albums called &quot;undertow&quot; or &quot;opiate&quot; not one song played off either. What a waste of my money to see them play. Buying this album was a waste too, for now it just collects dust. I miss the old Tool, it's a shame, now everyone LOVES Tool and they are releasing this kind of junk.
6304696515|5.0|There's a certain degree of sinful pleasure hidden beneath the depravity of &quot;Dangerous Liaisons,&quot; a film that is perversely elegant in its execution and daringly naughty in regard to its story. Based on the novel by Choderlos de Laclos, the script by Christopher Hampton explores the cause and effect nature of love, betrayal, and sinful intentions in both humorous and serious lights. While the material could be easily morose and unaffecting, director Stephen Frears spices up his canvas with a beautiful cast and a well-constructed production design. <br />At the center of the story are two people who feed on the misery they cause others as a way to keep their urges for one another suppressed. Glenn Close is the seductively evil Marquise de Merteuil, a self-proclaimed &quot;virtuoso of deceit&quot; who believes it her duty to dominate the opposite sex, and avenge her own. Her latest undertaking involves the daughter of her naive friend Madame de Volanges (Swoozie Kurtz), for whom her former lover left her. In hopes of ruining daughter Cecile's (Uma Thurman) reputation, she calls upon beloved friend and partner in evil, Vicomte de Valmont, played by John Malkovich. Valmont, like Merteuil, prides himself on his accomplishments, and prizes the feeling of success that comes with the devastation he causes to women. <br />But he has different plans in mind, involving the seduction and ruin of one Madame de Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer), whose ideals and virtues are the exact opposite of these two wicked souls. His plan is concocted from the most cruel of intentions: to make her want him so badly that she does not relinquish her beliefs, but instead is crushed by them once she gives in to his advances. <br />Imagine his surprise when he finds that his task will not be as easy as he had at first hoped. When he finds that Tourvel is far more resistant than first expected, he agrees to aid Merteuil in her quest for revenge against Cecile. As the two weave their intricateweb of deception and betrayal, Valmont finds himself in a position he never imagined possible, and Merteuil finds herself in danger of losing her grip over him. <br />As you may have noticed, I've left out much of the important plot points concerning other characters; half the fun of this film is the unveiling of each evil plan, all of which fall into place in a manner that is ingeniously devilish and supremely potent. The manner in which these actions are carried out, and the overall effects they have, are unsettling, to be sure, yet there's a wondrous sense of awe about them, one that stems from the craftsmanship of such detailed revenges that are disturbing and mesmerizing at the same time. <br />For such a devious story to work, a talented cast is in order, and &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; supplies us with precisely that. Glenn Close is outlandish as Merteuil, mastering with incredible wit and sensibility the calculating nature of her character. She wonderfully portrays the physical beauty used to mask the cold-hearted novice with terrific gusto; in Merteuil's &quot;win or die&quot; conversation with Valmont, Close sells us on the character, and also proves her worth as an actress. <br />Mirroring this delightfully evil performance is that of Malkovich, whose delectable wit and cool masterminding of deceit are supremely effective. For his character to work, there must be two key factors involved: we must believe enough in his ability to seduce and destroy, and we must be able to accept the change of heart that comes after meeting Tourvel. Malkovich is able to accomplish both with suave, debonair charm and true emotional feeling within his words. <br />High praise to the supporting cast as well, who all give well-rounded performances. Pfeiffer portrays Tourvel's resistance and innocence perfectly, as well as the heartache and hardships once she accepts her feelings for Valmont. The two pawns in Merteuil's wicked game, Cecile and her young love, Chevalier Danceny, are played by Thurman and Keanu Reeves with a much-needed naivety and innocent virtue that casts Merteuil and Valmont in an even more chilling light. <br />In my praise of the cast, I've neglected to mention the superb art direction and production design for &quot;Dangerous Liaisons.&quot; Some of the best sets and costumes ever designed for a period motion picture reside here, conveying the elegance and aristocracy of pre-Revolution France in a very accurate manner; the bawdy, forceful score by George Fenton also receives high marks. Anyone looking for some fiendish fun with a believable premise need look no further than this film, a sheer delight of whimsy, devilish evil, and grotesque elegance.
B00005JKES|5.0|This is without a doubt the most creative, though provoking, startling, and visually pleasing television series ever produced.  The one downside to this DVD set is that it is missing the pilot episode.  HOWEVER, if one is willing, the pilot episode can be obtained via many online auctions.  It was released in limited production in parts of Asia.  Now all we need is for Fire Walk with Me to be released, and we can all sitt back with a piece of cherry pie and a damn fine cup of coffee and enjoy the series!
0446608955|5.0|I glanced at &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; because of the title, read it because of the blurb, and made it one of the very few books I own because I loved it after I read it.  I'll admit, I figured out the ending very early into the book.  But I loved the book so much that didn't hurt the reading one bit.  The whole story is wonderful and I've read it several times since.<br />I'm not a fan of Sparks- I've read &quot;The Notebook&quot; and the blurbs &amp; reviews for his other books but didnt like any of them.  But &quot;AW2R&quot; is a very touching, moving story about hope, faith, and love (the 3 things in live you should never to lose) which I still read every now and again.  It's one of the best books I've ever read.  If you like Sparks' other stuff, you'll like this.  And if you're like me and the subject matter touches your heart, you'll really love the book.
B00005Q66T|3.0|I grew up in the 80's and I never cared for Madonna very much but this compilation of her greatest hits is very good.  Her best work is &quot;Music&quot;  and &quot;Ray of Light.&quot;  If you were not a Madonna fan in the past I guarantee you will be now. In reading the previous written reviews, stating that she is not a singer, she's chameleon - I totally disagree.  She has a very good voice, no one can compare to her.  Everyone sounds the same these days ie. Britney and Christina  or Mariah etc. but Madonna has a beautiful unique voice.  If you are sick of the manufactured music out there, buy this CD or better yet buy &quot;Music.&quot;
B000059HAI|5.0|This movie rocks.  If you want to know about Pearl Harbor, this is the movie to see.  It is very authentic and historically accurate.  They used real WWII planes and ships in the movie, no CGI.  It's almost two movies in one.  This movie was an American/Japanese collaboration with the Americans directing their side with English speaking actors and a Japanese director handling the all Japanese speaking cast.  Extremely well done, if you ask me. Even though the viewer knows what's going to happen, they still manage to build up the drama.  The thing that really got me was how well the apathy in the U.S. military was portrayed.  The attitudes, disorganization, and lack of discipline really hit home.  General Short and Admiral Kimmel were portrayed exactly as I had always imagined them, incompetent buffoons.  I highly recommend this movie.
B00004TDRD|5.0|A Great movie and still gives me the chills.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|First of all I am just an average Joe who enjoys a good movie. My wife and I really enjoyed Pearl Harbor on the Big screen and look forward to seeing it on dvd. <BR>We all may not agree on whether it was good or not and there is no point in worrying about it. I thought it was a well put together movie and would suggest others to see it. <BR>Thanks for your time.
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris has found a way to take the subtext of life and put it on paper in a shameless, self-revealing way that leaves the reader gasping with laughter.  To take all the little, disjointed comments that you run through your head, but would never say aloud to anyone, whip them into chapter/book form, and find the courage to publish them so that millions of readers can see how  absurd you are takes a rare form of courage, a strong sense of self, and great talent.  David does it with a flair.  If you can't find something to identify with and laugh about in this book, then you are a pompous stuffed-shirt, and you'll probably show up as a character in David's next book!
B00005Q66T|2.0|If you're Madonna, obviously not enough.  While &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot; and &quot;Something To Remember&quot; included hits, unreleased singles, and never-been-released singles, GHV2 doesn't do 2/3 of that at all.  Just radio edits.  Please.  If I wanted radio edits, I would've kept my little cd singles.  Why didn't she use rare-hard-to-find-becasue-they're-import remixes?  Why didn't she release any new material? (Remember &quot;Justify My Love&quot;?  &quot;Rescue Me&quot;?  &quot;I Want You&quot;?  &quot;One More Chance&quot;?  &quot;You'll See&quot;?  all previously unreleased until they were released on their respective albums)  Personally, I think that she just needed a filler that way she can either (a) finish touring, (b) start recording, or (c) buy some time so that she can be a mother and wife.  I can understand all those reasons but c'mon!  Why would I buy a Greatest Hits of songs that I already have because I'm a die-hard Madonna fan?  As I said, if it was a remix greatest hits album, I would give this 5 stars and not 2.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Clint Mansell....PWEI what tops that? This movie and it's soundtrack come close. In my book he ranks right next to Angelo Badalamenti, (who is that you say? go see Lost Highway NOW) Anyways, This movie isn't about drugs, this movie IS drugs. Ok maybe not but it's one of the most profound anti-drug statements I have ever seen. oh yea and the music is really really amazing. Keep an eye on Darren A. (the director) he's reinventing Film Noir every 3 years. The Lynch of the 2000's. easy.
B000002BQK|5.0|I don't care what any other so-called &quot;Mariah fans&quot; say - this is her best conceptual album to date (even though my personal favorite is &quot;Music Box&quot;).  Here, Mariah shows us that she can go into the R&amp;B realm and still come out with something that's hot.  Like &quot;Babydoll&quot;, &quot;Breakdown&quot;, &quot;The Roof&quot;, &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; (w/ Dru Hill).  I'm really disappointed that the record company didn't release &quot;Breakdown&quot; commercially.  That was one hot single (in my opinion).  This album was like Mariah's declaration of independence - this is where she broke from her long time musical collaborations w/ walter afanasieff as well as her (now ex) husband tommy mottola.  this is where she broke through the pop-balladeer glass ceiling and began to spread her wings to fly.  For this screaming declaration of independence (and solid songs from start to finish), i want to give her 10 STARS!!!

B00005QZWJ|4.0|Living in Australia, LOTR will be released on Boxing Day (26th December). I've been listening to the Soundtrack for the past four weeks, and I've been very impressed with what I've heard thus far.<br />Just about everybody out there has a different idea on what the LOTR soundtrack should sound like. Should it have an epic John Williams feel? Or should it have the eclectic melodious feel of Danny Elfman? Or should it be like Goldsmith? The end result won't please everyone, because just about EVERYBODY out there has a fixed idea of what the soundtrack should be like. <br />I enjoyed it...for the most part. I wasn't expecting such a subtle rendering for this type of film. There are some tracks that have a grand-epic John Williams-type feel - &quot;The Bridge of Khazadum&quot; is a classic example, and so is &quot;Many Meetings&quot; and &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot;. More often, they're more subtle pieces like &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot;.<br />In conclusion, I don't feel that this soundtrack stands entirely on its own. It's very clear that the music is there to SUPPORT the film, not to overwhelm it.
B000001Y42|5.0|Limp Bizkit was a good band. This and Significant Other were both good CDs. Why? Because, unlike Choctlate Starfish And the Hotdog Flavored Water and New Old Songs, those 2 CDs actully make Limp Bizkit a rock band. Their debut album, what i'm reviewing, is a very good ROCK/rap CD. The songs I like are \\"Pollution\\", \\"Counterfeit\\", \\"Stuck\\", \\"Faith\\", \\"Indigo Flow\\", and \\"Leech\\". If you can count, that's 6 songs people, 6. Do you know how many songs I like on CSATHDFW? I like 1 song on CSATHDFW. But enough about that. This album has catchy lyrics, hard guitars, and overall good music. Songs like \\"Pollution\\", \\"Faith\\", \\"Counterfeit\\", and \\"Leech\\" make you just wanna bang your head, while songs like \\"Stuck\\" and \\"Indigo Flow\\" make it impossible not to listen because of the catchy rap lyrics. Anyway, let's hope Fred and the boys go back to the sound of this and Significant other and make SOME rock songs.<BR>Peace.-Watty69
B00005JKHP|4.0|I must confess that, like many other Star Trek fans, I would've placed this film on the bottom of my list. When I heard about this &quot;Director's Cut&quot; version I was a little suspicious. How could a film so ponderous be better edited so as to improve it? To my surprise, this motion picture has been given a radical overhaul - not just with brand-new special effects, but also with better pacing and editing.<br />The special effects have definitely been updated - although it's difficult to tell since the new sequences have been given the same grainy, visual quality of the old film. One sequence that comes to mind is the first full shot of the outside of the Ve'jur spacecraft. We really get a sense of the massive size of the creature, and just how much of a threat it really poses.<br />The acting is still a bit too wooden for my taste. However, the faster pacing of the Director's cut turns what was once bearable into something that's actually enjoyable to watch. I now understand a little better what approach Wise was trying to take with his characters.<br />The only criticism I have is with the extras. The documentaries are more of a PR exercise for Paramount Pictures than anything else. When the commentator starts discussing &quot;the Star Trek franchise&quot;, you know you're onto a bad thing. The commentary is also not very good - it's obvious that Robert Wise was reading from cue-cards, and that none of the commentators were in the same studio together...in fact, you wonder whether they're actually watching the film at all.<br />Still...despite the dearth of &quot;quality&quot; extras, the movie itself is definitely the main attraction. In the end, I enjoyed Robert Wise's more mature take on Star Trek. There's a sense of grand, epic adventure that's definitely missing from today's current incarnation. You can only sigh with nostalgia for what might've been.

0451167716|5.0|This book caught my eye; I was interested in how the book related to the movie. I found the book to be a lot more informational, so i go back sometimes and see what the movie producers left out. But this book kept me on the edge of my seat up until the end. The Mafia, no matter which type it is, is always an interesting thing. This book made the mafia look good and civil rather than any other movies or stories . I think the characters were matched up nicely with the movie. This book gave me more vocabulary; by reading this book I picked up on a couple of words. In this novel you can learn a lot more about the characters than you would in the movie, because there is an extended amount of detail on each one.
B000021YQV|5.0|Great screaming vocals, every one in this band is very talented, especially their drummer, very aggressive. A great hardcore cd that won't leave your cd till they make a new album. A masterpiece. Energetic
B00004Z459|4.0|I'm not a great fan of the Nu-Metal sound at all,as I find it all a bit melo-dramatic and morose.But I simply adore this album!To me it's diiferent from the others in that it pulsates with a vibrant energy.I also like the way they use the turntables to augment that heavy grungy guitar sound sound.Each song is backed by a furious beat and the combination of rapping meeting strong vocals are excellent also.The opening tracks are astounding.The guitar riff on &quot;Papercut&quot; is brilliant and when the harmonious vocals kick in,you just want this track to go on and on.The vocals sort of remind me of Faith No More at their very best.&quot;One Step Closer&quot; is another excellent track-again it's all very heavy,but melody is not compromised here.The track is slightly let down by the moronic rap bridge section.&quot;Crawling&quot; is an excellent track.The contrast between the piercing,screaming vocals of the chorus and the gentler vocals of the verses are amazing.Track 8 &quot;In The End&quot; is my own favourite-memorable keyboard riff meets more heavy guitars and great rhythms courtesy of the turntables once again.&quot;Forgotten&quot; goes from having major aggressive guitars to excellent rhythm guitars.The harmony in the vocals is once again excellent.Then the instrumental track &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot; proves the versatility of this group.What starts off as a hip-hop comedy act breaks into an amazing synth driven instrumental-the only pity being it only goes on for a couple of minutes.The closing track is very similar to the opening track-the vocals are very similar and the way the rap interjects is identical to many tracks heard previously-but when it's this good why change anything.This c.d. has many memorable tracks and of all the Nu-Metal groups I think Linkin Park are by far the best.Hopefully they'll be around for a long time yet!

B00005QDW1|4.0|This is probably not what diehard No Doubt fans were expecting, but that does not make it a bad album.  I loved Return of Saturn, but this is a very catchy offering from Gwen, et. al.  They even add a dash of reggae.  Here are the highlights:<br />1. Intro - really unnecessary, merely a clip from Rock Steady<br />2. Hella Good - an uptempo tune with a grinding beat.  kind of reminds me of Til I Die on Beautiful Garbage with the repeating guitar hook<br />6. Detective - easily the worst song of the CD.  this one's over the edge of sugary pop.<br />5. Underneath It All &amp; 8. Start the Fire - a little reggae, mon<br />7. Don't Let Me Down &amp; 11. Platinum Blonde Life - these songs are the truest to the old No Doubt sound<br />12.  Waiting Room - the highlight of the album.  This track done with Prince is a true gem.<br />One other thing to consider with this album:  if you liked the changes on Beautiful Garbage, you will like this album too.  Enjoy it for what it is.
B00005AUBA|5.0|This is a damn fine album.  It needs to be loud.  Make your pants shake, man!  It has everything an educated and interested listener wants.  It has a certain reassuring catchiness, full range sound, and a musical quality on every level.  &quot;Take Me Some Place Nice&quot; is wonderful, but also wonderfully short, leaving you thirsting for more after an ever too quick 55 seconds. This is the type of album that you can buy without hearing it first. I did and I haven't bought a bad CD in over 3 years.
6304873441|5.0|&quot;Anastasia&quot; is my 2nd favorite Disney Animation movie (My most favorite one is &quot;The Quest for Camelot&quot;)!! It's got fun and lovely songs, very nice animation characters, and lots of excitement! This movie is great to watch with your family.<br />This movie tells of the lost Russian princess Anastasia and her goal to find her true identity and how her family was killed by the curse of the evil sorceror, Rasputin (The revolution was the curse). When the revolution started in Russia, Anastasia, the royal family's youngest daugther, escapes barely with her life, but loses her memory when she tried to get on the train to Paris with her royal Grandmother. Anastasia falls from the train and hits her head but lives.<br />Demetre, who was the kitchen boy when the fateful day had happened,and his assistant, Vladimer hears that the Empress(which is the Grandmother) offers a huge amount of money for the one who finds her lost Russian princess, Anastasia. Demetree and Vladimer tries to find someone who looks like Anastasia to fool the Empress and get away with the money. They meet Anastasia, who calls herself Ania, and she is trying to find a way to get to Paris. The reason she wants to go to Paris is because her Grandmother had given her a music box with a key to make the music play.Ania (or Anastasia) has the key but does not remember how she had gotten it there or what it was for. On the key was an inscription: Together in Paris. Demetre and Vladimer is very suprised at Ania's likeness with Anastasia and 'tricks' her into pretending like Anastasia. They go off to Paris together but little do they know that Rasputin was still alive (but was falling apart into pieces because he had sold his soul to destroy the royal Russian family!) and had sent his evil minions to kill Anastasia. For if Anastasia was killed, Rasputin would no longer be 'falling apart'.<br />Can Anastasia and her 'friends' escape from the ghostly demons? Would Anastasia be able to recover her true identily?<br />I love this movie and it's wonderful to watch again and again! In my opinion, I think this movie had the best animation. I especially liked Rasputin's assistant, Bartok the Bat. Bartok wasn't really bad. I also liked Demetre, even though he WAS rather greedy at first, he became one of the heros in this movie. I very much recommend you to watch it!true identily? <br />I love this movie and it's wonderful to watch again and again! In my opinion, I think this movie had the best animation.

B0000011N5|5.0|This is the music that proved Donovan was not derivative, merely riding the Bob Dylan wave. It is magical, original, mystical, a sweet journey of imagination and lilting melodies to charm children and adults alike. The first part incorporates more complex arrangements and atmospheric effects, the second part is sparse with nature sounds, and mostly just guitar and bass and Donovan's wonderful vocals and storytelling lyrics. I remember sitting in my dorm room at the University of Michigan and blasting this music out the window on my SONY reel to reel to the smiling crowd below in the fall of '67. Now that it's available again, please listen to it, you won't be disappointed.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore does a fantastic job with the Fellowship of the Ring.  I thought Enya wasn't needed in the CD, but besides that, Shore's score is excellent!  From the rustic &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; to the strong brass &quot;The Ring goes South&quot;.<BR>This is an excellent soundtrack and I hope it wins the Oscar.
B00005UKE0|5.0|If you think about it, it is quite remarkable. One of the richest and most famous figures in pop music releases a multi-disc album of self-composed deeply felt spiritual songs that are not only sincere but of the highest quality. There isn't much to add to the information already found in the other reviews except that Harrison was deeply affected by the Edwin Hawkins Singers &quot;Oh happy day&quot; and that this album was the result of long brooding on that great gospel song. An album to enjoy, be moved by, and treasure. Thanks, George.
0783219598|4.0|This lovely and beautiful film was transferred beautifully onto DVD with ONLY a full-screen option and NO &quot;extras&quot;.  Was there NO additional information or commentaries on how these INCREDIBLE and almost believable talking animal scenes were done or on James Cromwell's fantastic (and Oscar-nominated) performance as Farmer Hoggett - who bonds with Babe the Pig and can think &quot;outside the box&quot; pretty well, allowing Babe the Sheep-Pig to fulfill his destiny.<br />I have NO quarrel with the movie - one of my all-time top 10, only with the DVD with NO extras!
B000000H66|5.0|For the uninitiated, Death was the band (along with a few notable others) that spearheaded the American death metal wave of the mid- to late- 80's and into the 90's.  Coming from Florida, it's no surprise that such a significant band would influence so many others from the same geographical region to play within the same musical frame, which is why the late 80's spawned so many death metal acts from Florida.  Chuck Schulinder and company (in other words, whoever joined him on each individual release) drove home many classic albums that gave a sort of \\"state of the union\\" appeal for American death, with the most acclaimed being the first three - \\"Scream Bloody Gore\\", \\"Leprosy\\", \\"Spiritual Healing\\".  In retrospect, \\"Spiritual Healing\\" was a turning point in Chuck's musical ambition and lyrical stance.  Death's music expanded into a thrashier demeanor, something that would eventually morph itself into a progressive feel. Considering the changes with Death's direction, their 80's and 90's output can be pretty much split in two - the first three rattling death metal releases in one lump and the more progressive material in the second.  Keep in mind, however, that despite the change in direction, none of the power, intensity, or aggression was lost one bit.<BR>Of these later albums that might fit the description of progressive death metal - sorry, that's the best I can do! - the highlight is definitely \\"Symbolic\\", which was supposed to be the final album under the Death banner, from what I hear.  In fact, the follow-up to this album, \\"The Sound Of Perseverance\\", was not even supposed to happen as a Death LP.  Originally intended as the debut from Chuck's new band Control Denied, the timing apparently wasn't right.<BR>So what to make of \\"Symbolic\\"?  It simply has some of the most technical musical wizardry laid down on any metal album.  Ever.  To this day, I listen to this CD flabbergasted, wondrous (...how can they DO that?!?!?!) at the obvious talent oozing and drippingfrom every riff and every fill.  Oh, the humanity!  But, alas, there is more to a successful album than sheer aptitude.  There's the music itself - and boy does it kill!  This line-up's superior talent was required in order to execute all this ferocious madness so flawlessly while making it seem so effortless.  There are tons of melodic sensibilities at work in most of the tracks, but they aren't overdone to sickening measures like you'd expect in many other \\"melodic death metal\\" acts who simply put too much emphasis on the \\"melodic\\" side of things to make the music still \\"death metal\\".  There are very few \\"melodic death metal\\" bands that can do this well - and this album was proof of one that could.  In other words, for each melodic riff, whether slow, mid-paced or speed-laden, there's a driving flat-out thrash-fest (shall I call it anti-melodic?) to counteract.  Case in point:  the 6  minute opening title track starts the CD ominously and weaves its way back and forth between meaty mid-paced sections and Death's own trademark double bass speed techniques - a characteristic that finds its way in the much of the album.  <BR>Perhaps thinking of the lead guitar melodies and prog-rock complexities of Iron Maiden counter balanced with the brutality of Death's finest would best represent the direction here.<BR>Of the nine superb compositions, I always seem to find myself wanting a second dose of the title track, \\"1,000 Eyes\\", \\"Empty Words\\", \\"Crystal Mountain\\", \\"Misanthrope\\", and even the epic \\"Perennial Quest\\".  I know that accounts for the majority of the album, but with such masterful tracks to sift through maybe that's yet another testament to the brilliance on this disk.<BR>In conclusion, I suppose one of the most important reasons to hear \\"Symbolic\\" - and even \\"The Sound Of Perseverance\\" - is to experience how far one man could push Death Metal.  Unfortunately, Chuck Schulinder's drive, hunger, and ambition to do just that was coldly stripped away from him when hewas forced to put down his guitar and fight the battle of his life - cancer.  A battle he fought with the utmost dignity and pride, in fact.  Even mere weeks before he ultimately lost that battle in December of 2001, he was in the press acknowledging that more Death and Control Denied albums were inevitable.  Chuck's talent and vision are evident in all of Death's albums, but it's obvious that \\"Symbolic\\" was just that - symbolic of what he thought metal was all about.
B000059ZLH|3.0|I used to love DT, now I can't stand them. I think I have a love/hate mindset towards them. haha. Theres no question the talent is phenominal. What annoys me is how they try to mix it with mainstream rock. I think they should just stop pretending to be songwriters and go off and make an album where they just (...) forever with those jazz riffs and weird beats. Then they can make another that is just straightforward metal without all the weird sidetracking solos and beats. Their technique is so good it boggles the mind! However this stuff will make you crazy with the spastic drumming and dissonant chords.  I'm a talented guitarist and I have to listen to this. I think it is required listening for musicians. BUT, which are they going to do...show off or write tasty melodic songs? I hope they decide before I pull my hair out.
B00000DLVA|4.0|I think that there will be many fans out there who, like me, only heard of the Cardigans when they reissued 'Lovefool' to coincide with the release of Baz Luhrman's 'Romeo and Juliet' for which it was the theme.  After that the group seemed to disappear from the charts, releasing only one other single 'Your New Cuckoo'.  Then when nobody was looking, they were back with the fantastic 'My Favourite Game'.  This was followed up by two later singles 'Erase/Rewind' and 'Hanging Around'.<br />Whilst the Cardigans have left behind their pop roots that was so evident on previous albums such as 'First Band On The Moon' and 'Life', that doesn't mean to say that this change in style is simply an effort to become more modern.  This album is different from any other material the band have released and it's just as good.  Nina Peerson's vocals are of that unusual kind that can sound sweet and innocent but also beautiful and haunting.  This album is definitely all beautifully haunting.<br />There's a good mix of both fast and slow songs, with the singles probably being the pick of a good bunch.  There's not one that's a duff.  The sound seems to be a little more electronica here, which fits well with the album and actually reminds me a little of French group Air.  This is a decidedly non-pop album, and the change of direction has paid off because this may even be better than the Cardigan's previous offerings.<br />Now though, the band appears to have split, although Nina's excellent vocals live on in her new band A Camp.  She still maintains that the Cardigans haven't split up - here's hoping.
B00005U2LM|3.0|A good album by the Wu-Tang clan yet again, a good improvement from the rather dissapointing &quot;The W&quot; but it comes a close second to being the best one of their albums, compared to &quot;36 Chambers&quot; it's definetely worth the money though.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is a great movie.  It's long and comes in 2 DVDs.  I love every minute of it. It has romance, action, and tragedy.  Everything a war movie fanatic loves.
B00003CXAA|5.0|These movies are like the most addictive soap opera!  We watched about an hour at a time until we had watched all three movies in one week.  And to be honest, I really want to know what happens to the family after godfather III!  Many people find the third movie to be the weakest, and while I will admit, that plotwise it is hard to follow (make sure you watched the other two very recently!), emotionally I thought it was necessary.  The second one seemed to me to be void of emotion...especially for michael.  This last one reminded us that he was human afterall.  <BR>    The special features were great.  very entertaining...we watched all of them immediately after watching the last movie.  I highly recommend this set!
B00005LQ6S|5.0|Aside from an editing mishap in the final duel between Jacob Kell and Duncan, where one fight scene is actually repeated, I felt the movie as a a whole was quite well done.  Although the main protagonists include Connor, Jacob, and Duncan and Kate (Faith), this is really Duncan and Kate's Story, giving you their background.  <br />While the movie is more than adequately propelled by the actions of villain Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne), I was quite impressed by the fine performance given by Lisa Barbuscia as Kate/Faith.  Not only is she believable in her dual roles, she does an outstanding job of portraying a complex person who has both love and bitterness for her former true love and husband.  She is also a person that you do not want to fault for her coldness because we gradually become aware that her condition was brought about in part by a mistake made by our hero Duncan from their past.  Apparently they have not yet worked things out and a good part of the movie allows you to follow their relationship's progress.  We also learn that her and her other immortal &quot;friends&quot; are really slaves to Jacob Kell and are forced to do his bidding or face eternal death by beheading.<br />But what impressed me most was that she was able to convey her mixed feelings about Duncan with such great subtlety.  In almost every scene together, or where the conversation is about Duncan, she ever so slightly hints towards her true inward feelings with her facial expressions.  In a way, this is a love story that ended abruptly in the past but now has a chance at redemption if Kate can find it in herself to forgive Duncan.  <br />All in all, well done.  There is the great martial arts action of course, but the story is deeper than that.  If you can forgive a little bit of editing at the end, you should find this is a very fine film.

B000002J6H|4.0|This was Stills' first, &amp; probably best solo album at a time when Stills could do no wrong. Arguably the backbone of the Buffalo Springfield &amp; CSN(Y), this album also has some great session work by Hendrix(!) &amp; Clapton, among others. <br />Few of the songs were being  previously performed at CSNY shows, &amp; the Black Queen here finds him in a REALLY raspy voice (which is quite effective). Other songs on this album hold up extremely well, &amp; probably could've been used on future CSN(Y) projects. His intrumental work, arrangements, &amp; singing make this album a  gem from this time period. And he wasn't alone, as his on &amp; off again cronies Crosby &amp; Young were churning out A rate material around this period.<br />It was hard to predict then, but his work after this solo album becomes inconsistent...&amp; after seeing the recent CSNY project, I couldn't help  but wonder... what happened? Although his guitar work was still good, his voice &amp; frame have not aged gracefully....&amp; he doesn't appear to be able to use his changing voice the way Bob Dylan has.<br />Arguably the most talented Springfield &amp; CSNY member, this album is highly recommended. His place in rock has diminished significantly through the years, but not due to this remarkable album.

He is today's king, and Angels Flight, involving the murder of a high-profile African-American attorney is one of his best Harry Bosch adventures.  Capturing the LA of today, with its mixture of ethnicities and more than a touch history, Angels Flight is a top flight mystery.  It is a book for the angels.
B00005QDW1|3.0|Somewhere along the lines of the many reviews written, I hear this might me a comeback album. It's okay. Not the best from No Doubt- if you really want some unique style, Beacon Street and Tragic Kingdom are their best, showing off more originality and less drama of Gwen and Gavin's relationship in the lyrics. Don't get me wrong, there's some great songs on here. Hey Baby was first released, so it's all over the radio, Hella Good is catchy. Making Out too. But the background in Running sounds like someone clipped the original Super Mario Bros. background and looped it. If you want to hear Reggae meets pop go for it.
B00005LOUP|1.0|Dr. Seuss NEVER would've allowed this movie to be made if he were alive! It was his money grubbing ninny of a wife who gave the nod on this disaster. I'm sure he is turning over in his grave. It was really awful! Not to mention dissapointing considering some of the talent that was involved (Ron Howard directing, Rick Baker providing the makeup, and Sir Anthony Hopkins providing narration)They took FAR to many liberties with the original story simply to drag it out enough to make it movie length. No real Suess fan could possibly enjoy this movie. The only good thing I can say is that the computer animation was done quite well. It was used judiciously and is virtually imperceptible. PASS THIS UP AND GET THE ANIMATED ORIGINAL. It is far, far superior!
B00005JKES|5.0|THE PILOT - ....  The pilot has been in stores (yes, on DVD) as an import for well over a month.  Silver Platters, Tower, Scarecrow Video....  <br />The Episodes - The sound is hypnotizing, the graphic clarity is unbelievable. There are some scenes with hints of grain, but even these scenes are far better than anything we've ever seen - even the original broadcast. The music is rich and deep, and the sounds are clean. The only real complaint I have is that the case doesn't hold the last (fourth) disc in; this may be a defect exclusive to my case, but I thought I'd mention it.<br />The Special Features - Some are fascinating, some are a drag. It's fun to dig through them, and you're sure to find something interesting, but you'll probably be left wanting more. Most disappointing was that I especially wanted to see cut scenes, outtakes, more pieces of the Twin Peaks world... maybe they'll come with the 2nd Season DVDs or Fire Walk With Me.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney proves that she can hold her own among contemporary pop acts. With only a few hints at the bubble gum from her first two CDs, a lot of the tracks show a more mature Britney.  Keep this progress up and she will be around for a long time.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I've listen to the CD and I think it's great. Everyone judges her by her voice but you have to seperate entertainers from singers. Britney is an entertainer. She has catchy songs, great dance moves, and style. All her songs present a teenager growing up and the obstacles a girl goes through. Her songs makes me stronger. And regardless of her positive and negative things said about her, she's human &amp; the same as any person. The songs I love from her album are &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Let me be&quot;, &quot;I love Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, and &quot;What it's like to be me&quot;. And for everyone that puts her down in the reviews, make a judgement of yourself before judging her...and maybe you'll see what's it like to be Britney and how unfortunate it is to be &quot;jealous&quot; you!

630575067X|2.0|The visual effects are outstanding. The duel at the end is spectacular. Now that the &quot;good&quot; is out of the way, the story is awful! It seems that Lucas tried to fit too much into this movie. Everything happened too fast as though the Jedi started in the morning and defeated Darth Maul by lunch. The characters were rediculous. You can't help but hope Jar-Jar gets shot in the head, or hope that you do. At least one of you has some relief! And the Vice-roy. These guys sound like Japanese being stereotyped with that &quot;bad english&quot; accent.The acting in this movie was pathetic. What was Lucas thinking when he cast Anakin? This kid CAN NOT act. Any kid could act as good as that. There are many child actors who would have done well in that movie. It wasn't just him, no one in this movie did a good job. This is definately a rental, don't buy it!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is the most easy starting point for anybody to beging listening to the Beatles in the market today. Its just one CD with most of the better known songs. From this CD one can begin building the most essecial collection in Pop/Rock music. Every Beatle album has something to offer to the history of rock and recording music. <br />As for this CD, the booklet is informative and very well design. The songs are all in the stereo mix and not the original mono recordings. This could be a minus for those who grew up listening to the original versions but not for new casual fans. This CD seems to be the last Beatle album to be edited as no new material has surface since the release on the Antology series.

The day after Christmas we say \\"next year we're not doing this.\\" Well, it's next year and the gifts have been bought, the (...) roast has been ordered, the wine is in the cellar and the decorations are up. So when I picked up this book and started to identify I almost cancelled everything...but then I read on...now I'm ALMOST sure we're doing the right thing. On top of remembering how important tradition can be it was one of the funniest books I've read in a long time.  I was actually laughing out loud on the train.  I mean not just smiling--laughing.  I liked it so much it may become a tradition too.  Can't wait for the next Grisham!!!!
B00005QXXO|3.0|I expected more from this album when I first hear it was going to be released. Kid A and Amnesiac are very interesting records that represented a huge step foward for Radiohead. This said, Radiohead could have done a better job with a full live set instead of just live recordings that are not well linked together. The sound mix could have been better as the songs sometimes lack clarity. Overall, the performances are good and some of the songs have new arregenments and this saves the album from completely crashing. <br />I hope the band releases a better live CD in the future or a video that would be more representative of how creative and original they are.
B000002GEV|5.0|This is not just Supertramp's best record, it's also one of the greatest all-round rock records of the early '70s. Unfortunately, it would be all downhill for the band from here.<br />&quot;Crime of the Century&quot; pulls off the idea of a &quot;concept&quot; album with out coming off as overblown, pretentious or cliched. Each song, in fact, seems to be its own little self-contained rock opera.<br />The band had not yet sunk into the ubiquitous falsetto that plagued latter efforts like in &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; and the cloying &quot;Breakfast In America.&quot; The songs themselves on &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; are relatively lengthy pieces layered and textured with tempo changes, movements, and other effects. (By the time they recorded &quot;Breakfast In America&quot; three years later, they were reduced to writing three-and-a-half-minute pop songs rife with lyrical cliches with a glossy production sheen so luminous that it bleached way what little passion the songs may have had.)<br />That was not the case with &quot;Crime of the Century.&quot; The songs here are dark, ansgst-ridden and a bit cynical. Songs like &quot;Hide In Your Shell,&quot; and &quot;Ayslum&quot; deal with coping with mental illness and offer such dark-humored lyrics as &quot;Will he take a sailboat ride? He is very likely to. Will feel dead inside? He is very likely to!&quot;<br />I am particularly fond of &quot;Rudy,&quot; -- a Supertramp concert staple and maybe one of their best songs ever. It's a piano-based rocker sung from the point of view of a gentleman who is not sure if he's made the right choices in life (&quot;Rudy's on a train to nowhere... halfway down the line...&quot;) and is hoping for some sort of redemption we all know will never come.<br />The singles here, &quot;School,&quot; and &quot;Bloody Well Right,&quot; almost seem Floydian in the way they chastise the public education system of the day and rail against its administrators' tendency to try make everyone the same by stripping unsuspecting students of their uniqueness or individuality. The song does a great job of conveying the sense of anger, frustration and resignation such institutionalization creates.<br />The writing, arranging and playing on &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; is first rate and strikingly original. (Tell me, who do you think Supertramp is being influenced by here? Who are they emmulating? The answer is nobody... they've truly created an original sound.)<br />After &quot;Crime of the Century,&quot; Supertramp released 4 more albums with this classic line-up (headed by writers Roger Hodgeson - guitar, and  Rick Davies - keyboards). While most of the albums are good... with each subsequent release the band took another step closer to the &quot;pop&quot; millieau that help sell so many copies of &quot;Breakfast In America.&quot;<br />While we're on that subject... remember ALL rock music is indeed &quot;pop&quot; music... but not all pop music is rock. <br />But when it comes to &quot;Crime of the Century,&quot; there is no doubt that this album rocks with the best of the early- to mid-70s rock 'n' roll canon that included the likes of such lumanaries as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple and truck load of other heavy progessive bands.<br />This is also a great &quot;headphone&quot; album with lots of great piano work, intersting special effects and insightful, thought-provoking lyrics that manage, for the most part, to stay clear of the overly maudline and the cliche.<br />Hodgeson and Davies also, at this point in their writing careers, had a great sense of melody. So, while the songs' arrangements may be dense and complex, they remain accessable and easy to sing along with. (Which, after a few listens, I'm betting you will!)<br />When one listens to &quot;Crime of the Century&quot; one can't help but wonder what would have happened if Hodgeson and Davies had managed to get along and the band had stayed the course all these years.<br />Ah, butthat's just rock 'n' roll... Ain't it?
B00005QK3W|5.0|Paul McCartney has been recording some of the most beautiful music of the last 40 years whether it was with the Beatles, Wings or during his solo career. This is something to take into consideration when listening to this record. Paul is in his 60's but you can not tell that by this recording. Driving Rain is full of live and soul. Its incredible how he can still come up with such great pop tunes with such ease after all these years. For the last couple of years Paul McCartney has battle with the lost of his wife Linda with the help of his music. This record is no exception as it contains very personal lyrics such as &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot;, &quot;I Do&quot;, &quot;About you&quot; but instead of dwelling on the lost Paul celebrates life and the time spent with his wife. A record like Drivin Rain is a salute to the future and to new things to come as stated in the song &quot;Back in the Sunshine Again&quot;.<br />The songs are beautifully played and produced making the record sound like if Paul and the band are playing the songs inside your room. A personal and affectionate recording from one of the most giffted musician of the 20th century.
6305907145|2.0|Yes, it borrows the basic plot outline, characters, and place names from the book, but that's about it. Almost no one is recognizable as a character I knew from the book. Instead of being a woman who is in almost every other way almost a slave to others (making her moral strength all the more remarkable), Fanny comes across as an independent, opinionated modern woman. Perhaps Rozema invented a subplot involving slaves in the family holdings in the Caribbean because she knew that someone in the story should be powerless, but she couldn't bear for it to be her main character? The device of suddenly freezing the action seemed like a desperate afterthought - it happens too late in the movie to work as a recurring device. I saw this over a year ago and frankly I don't remember much more about it.
B00000JL86|4.0|If it was'nt for all the long songs, that i think should be cutted down, 'Anastasia' could have been one of the best non-Disney movies of the 90's, and of all the things that saves the movie, is of course, the beautyful Anastasia, Pooka and Bartok, the dazzling special effects, and the evil Rasputin, that is both cruel and funny, the whole family will enjoy this star filled movie.
B000059Z8J|3.0|I'd been waiting for Superman to be released on DVD for a long time.  So when I saw it in a special edition pack with Superman II, I grabbed it straight away.<BR>The first half of the movie is pretty much the same as the old video and TV releases of the movie.  The extra bit at the start with Marlon Brando is OK, but I think that you see most of that in Superman II anyway(?).<BR>The second half of the movie is really poor.  It suffers from being extremely disjointed.  The missile heists, in particular, are cut down to only a few minutes.  The final grabbing of Lex Luthor and Otis by the Man of Steel does not happen - one second you're looking at Lois Lane in the desert, a quick cut to Superman flying, then all of a sudden it's night and Superman is flying into a prison with a villain under each arm.<BR>Audio - well I'm not too sure here, but it seemed that the audio was muffled throughout.  I will have to check that on another setup though.<BR>Overall, still a good movie.

B00003CXCQ|5.0|I cannot describe 'Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarfs' in words, it's a true classic with unforgettable songs and characters, and the whole family will spend hours with this double DVD edition, that includes galleries, games and much more!<br />If you are a big Disney fan like me, buy this amazing DVD!
B00000DGUG|5.0|When i first heard JLP i was immediately taken away with it. The anger in the lyrics was something that directly affected me. So when i find out that she was going to release a new album i was thrilled because i had to wait 3 years for a new album!!! I went to the shop and bought it right away. When i was in my room and listend to the album i was i bit disappointed. There was now rage and it was at my opinion more whining. Especially the songs Sympathetic Character and Your Congratulations did absolutely not appeal to me. When days went by the album was begining to intrigue me and i kept on singing the songs. Without knowing i began to think about the meaning of the songs (something that i had never done before) and to my surprise i found out that the song Sympathetic Character had a very sad meaning, a meaning in wich i could find myself back. Also Your Congratulations, Would Not Come, Are You Still Mad, Can't Not and I Was Hoping. I began to like those songs so much that i actually forgot about the existence of JLP and began to adore the live performances of Sympathetic Character, Would Not Come and Baba. Now i found JLP back (i mean i started listening to it again) but nothing compares to SJIJ!<BR>If i can gave you a tip when you listen to SFIJ take some time to let it come to you and think further than only the melody but also think about the lyrics WHAT she is trying to say.<br />For those who read this, the 25th of February 2002, she is releasing her BRAND NEW ALBUM Under Rug Swept!! The JLP fans as well as the SFIJ fans must like this album because the 11 songs both are JLP as SFIJ style.<br />Conclusion this album as in some way changed my live in a very positif way. I hope some of you guys agree with me!
B00005JKES|5.0|Everyone who's pissy about the pilot should know that Artisan tried really hard to get it.  They should also know that the pilot is available on factory-sealed on regionless NTSC DVD from many HK eBay dealers.  You could probably find at least 10 on sale right now.  For anyone in L.A. or S.F. you can also get it at AMOEBA RECORDS.
B00005QDW1|4.0|When i first bought this album, and popped it into my CD player, i was kind of surprised. I knew that No Doubt was going for a more dance - hall kind of sound, but this doesn't sound at all like the No Doubt we all know and love. That doesn't mean that it's bad music. In fact, that 13.99 was well spent. <BR>The tracks &quot;Detective&quot; and &quot;Plaitnum Blond Life&quot; are reminders of the kind of ska inspired music they used to play.<BR>It's a good album, overall. Just...different. And a sound that we're not used to hearing from No Doubt. But i recommend it all the same.
B00000IGGA|5.0|Although this is not another re-invention for Tom Waits, it works as a sort of amalgram of the best things he has ever done. Particularly his work from Swordfishtrombones on is represented at an exellent cross-section here - this is an artist doing what he does best. One review I saw put it perfectly when it called this album a &quot;greatest hits of brand new songs.&quot; Waits indulges in all of his penchants here, and quite well at that: from bizzare, Captain Beefheart-esque rockers, to bitingly witty spoken word pieces, to touching, heartfelt, piano-led ballads. We see Waits using a lot of different voices here, employing a wealth of different instruments, and writing several different types of songs. And this is an ALBUM; certainly there are standout tracks, but it works well as a whole, has its own identity (like all good Waits does), and the running order is essential to its clarity. One can see just how much difference a good running order make when the delirious up-tempo rant Filipino Box Spring Hog gives way to the beautiful ballad Take It With Me and the decidedly Waits-ian gospel, Come On Up To The House. All in all, a simply masterful album. Pop this disc in, and let the weird, twisted, simply irrestible world of Tom Waits enfold you.
B00005U2LM|3.0|It isn't 36 Chambers, but it's ample Wu-banga material for now.  Still waiting for their next great album.  Would've been an extra star if ODB was in the house.  Might grow on me like the last Bobby Digital album, which is pretty good.  Rza rocks.
B00005LB50|5.0|The Buffalo Springfield box set is, in short, an absolute necessity for anyone interested in the history of rock and roll.  The Springfield had a short, tumultuous history as a band, but their influence has stretched far and wide.  Just think of it... Three tremendous musicians that went on to give birth, not just to solo careers, but to CSN, CSN&amp;Y, Manassas, Poco, and Souther-Hillman-Furay.  <BR>In undertaking an anthology like this there is no way to win.  Everybody will have an opinion on what should have been included and what should have been left off.  Personally, I wish I could get my hands on every recording -- legit or bootleg -- as well as any video of their performances.  The demos here are interesting in the sense of giving us a peek at how the songs were first presented in their raw form. I especially enjoyed Young's &quot;Flying on the Ground...&quot;,  Still's &quot;Four Days Gone&quot;, and Furay's pure and simple &quot;Sad Memory&quot;.  <BR>Stills and Young went on to greater fortune and fame after BS and sadly, Furay is sometimes overlooked as a result.  Make no mistake about it; as this box reveals Furay could hold his own against two future giants.  &quot;What A Day&quot; is a great Furay song, with a great arrangement, and well performed with Stills on the lead.  (One of the interesting things about BS is how often the writer would not sing the lead on his own song...).  My fav BS song beyond all doubt is &quot;On The Way Home&quot; written by Young and given an infectious arrangment and incredibly uplifting vocal performance by Furay.<BR>I could easily go on and on... JUST BY THIS THING!  YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!
0780625129|5.0|American History X is not your ordinary (...) Hollywood movie. It doesn't have a meaningless action plot line or a phony love story. It doesn't have a happy ending there aren't any heroes or heroine. What it does have is racism, ignorance, prejudice and pure hatred. It shows a negative part of our society as we don't want to see it, but as it truly is. It's an original movie that goes were no other has dared. American History X shows things that are hard to look at and hard to accept. <BR> This isn't a movie that I should have to recommend because everybody should see it. Asking someone what they think of this film is like asking what they think of stone, this movie is about the truth. It's not about how good the acting is or if the storyline makes sense it's the message that everyone comes away with. Plus all that criteria for a good movie are in this film anyway.<BR> The film starts of with Derek brutally killing two gang members for trying to steal his car. He goes to prison for only three years even though his actions that were shown could of landed him in prison for his life. Danny, Derek's younger brother says that if he would of testified Derek would get life in prison. Danny not testifying portrays Danny's strong love for his brother. It will also explain Danny becoming more and more like his brother that is at time in jail.    <BR> The film goes onto to explain Derek's reasoning for his racist views. This is a strong point in the movie; the viewer for the first time maybe in the first time in his life try's to understand, a racist and a murderer. It becomes clear that Derek's future views had a lot to do with his father. At the dinner table one day, Derek talks about how his teacher is making him read this book, which has a premise of white prejudice towards blacks. Derek's father tells him not to absorb everything that his teacher tells him. It is a warning that to me infers Derek's reaction to his father's death. When Derek's father is killed in a fire Derek is shown on TV being interviewed. Derek lets loose saying indirectly that minorities caused his father's death and that they plague America. Derek then is shown leading a gang of enraged teens to attack a supermarket. Derek's views have materialized and he plans to do something.<BR>  The film continues with Derek in jail, from this point on the film jumps backwards and forwards a lot. Derek in jail refuses to see anyone from his family because he is ashamed and he thinks it will make it harder for him in jail by always thinking about them. Derek has found his group; he knew that if he didn't find people with the same views as himself he would probably get killed. When he notices that one of the people in his group is dealing with a minority he is disgusted by it and wants answers, but the others in the group don't see it so seriously. That's when Derek disses his group and they rape him in the bathroom for it. <BR> This is a turning point in the story, when his old teacher comes to visit him the same teacher the Danny now is thought by. The teacher makes an interesting comment that to Derek \\"Has anything in your life made your life any better?\\" From this point on Derek starts to think about what has happened to him and what he has done in his life. This will become more evident as the story goes on and Derek's views are made clearer. The only people he has ever trusted betray Derek. Whatever these people actually were; nazi's, white supermist or skinheads, he was without their protection now and he would be alone in the worst place to be alone in. Derek feared for his life, thinking that the black inmates would come for him one of these days. His co-worker in jail is black. After the incident he becomes his friend and you see Derek transforming thorugh this realization. When Derek does get out of jail he thanks his friend for keeping him alive. <BR> When Derek comes out jail the first thing he wants to do is to confront his old friend that organized the hate group. When he does, he knocks him out. Derek has made a realization that this whole hate is not good for anything and this man who he thought was his friend is a two-face liar letting two kids go to jail for his crimes. When Danny finds out of what Derek has to explain his actions to his brother and he tells him everything that he encountered while in jail. <BR> There are two more powerful scenes that make the ending to the film. When Derek and Danny get back home they tear down all the nazi pictures and flags and they throw it all out. The next scene comes up when Danny gets to school. He is shot six times in the bathroom by another teen that he had a confrontation with before. The confrontation was nothing big and it exactly points out what kind of senseless violence and pure hatred still goes on in America. <BR> The film has nice ending with Danny reading his paper about his brother that he was asked to write by the same teacher that visited Derek while in jail. Another style effect that I found fitting was black and white color that was used whenever a look back to the past was made. And anything that happened in the present was in color. <BR> This movie is one of the best movies for its originality with dealing with racism, ignorance and prejudice. This film at the least has made people think about the truth of our society. As we live together in the 21st century can we get along, can we get rid of prejudice and hatred as it is shown in this movie. Is racism something that has existed since the beginning of man kind and if so could it be stopped. What kind of a program could we do on such wide scale, then I guess someone did try to do that, the director of American History X. I know at the least it has made people think. People can easily identify with this film it seems so real and it's so powerful, that you think you've just witnessed a lot if it right in front of you and not on a screen. American History X provided the viewer with a hard-hitting, no holds barred drama and a look at, how in this story prejudice began and where it lead.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|THIS MOVIE WAS A REAL TREAT THE FIRST TIME I WATCHED IT. IT WAS WELL ANIMATED, HAD SOME FUNNY PARTS AND THE IDEA OF PUTTING ROCK MUSIC IN A ANIMATED MOVIE WAS...WELL... ORIGINAL! WHEN I WATCHED THE MOVIE FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD TIME IT LOST SO MUCH OF IT'S MAGIC.  MOST OF THE JOKES SOUNDED MORE DUMB AND ANOYING THE SECOND TIME AROUND.  AND THE DONKEY....UHHH HE GOT A LITTLE OLD THE FIRST TIME, AND BECAME UNBEARABLE EACH VIEWING AFTER THAT! MOST PEOPLE I KNOW LIKE SHREK SO IF YOU WANT TAKE THE CHANCE AND BUY IT BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU RENT IT FIRST,WATCH IT A FEW TIMES AND SEE IF IT IS REALLY WORTH TAKING UP SPACE IN YOU HOME ENTERTAINMENT LIBRARY. I GIVE THIS MOVIE 3 STARS FOR THE GOOD FIRST IMPRETION AND FOR THE GINGERBREAD BOY....GOT TO LOVE HIM. LOL!!! GO SEE MONSTERS INC.
0451527712|5.0|Subtitled &quot;the modern promethius&quot; you find in this book lots of criticism of the promethian impulse to go too far and achieve too much. But that's not all. You find everything from veiled feminism to the plight of the monster -- to allusions to cool books and places. Do not confuse with movie! pshht! I said no!<br />The monster is da coolest dude man, except when he becomes a vile murderer and can't figure out a way to convince people to like him. But other than that, a cool dude, man! Read it to the end and also read the intro :)
0452282152|3.0|I didn't like the writer's style at all--she tries to make every word very colorful and to play with your imagination and does it very poorly: every sentence is a hoard of images and a poor blend, too. She would say something like this: &quot;her eyes were as blue as a sky in the mid afternoon,when the rain has just ended and the little pink and white clouds are running by like young horses.&quot; (I'm exagerrating,but you get the idea).<BR>You do get some feeling from this book about the life in Delft in Vermeer's times but the story fails to give you any idea about where the artist drew his inspiration.  Everything revolves around this fiction character of a girl and it doesn't build characters ---everyone in the book is either good or bad.
6304708491|5.0|The main reasons I enjoy this film are:  1) The Beatles are in it and 2) I love the songs.  I admit, as an inveterate Beatles fan, I am rather biased on this one.<br />Ringo becomes the target of a crazed cult who pursues him because he wears &quot;the sacrificial ring.&quot;  High Priestess Ahme (played by Eleanor Bron) leads a band of inept thugs on a wild chase, following the Beatles from England to the Bahamas.<br />Each Beatle maintains his own distinct, individual and unique personality and input.  John provides the quick quips, (&quot;I'm into rhythm guitar and mouth organ,&quot; he tells one thug).  Paul provides the straight answers and is a serious foil to John's tendency to fall back into light banter.  George maintains a stoic pose and does not go along with popular opinion gladly.  In one memorable scene, Victor Spinetti, whose role in this movie is to protect the Beatles, claims he can do voice imitations from &quot;Cagney to Ringo,&quot; George grimaces and says, &quot;Doesn't sound A BIT like Cagney!&quot;  He also tells a motoring thug who inadvertently picks him up, &quot;thanks for the lift, sailor!&quot;<br />Ringo appears quite at ease with acting.  He maintains his lovable, good old Ringo persona and yet he shows a delightful streak of independence.  Ringo does not suffer a fool gladly and he provides many clever retorts throughout the movie.<br />I admit, I really enjoyed this movie.  I preferred the Beatles' first film, the 1964 classic &quot;A Hard Day's Night,&quot; but I do enjoy this one.  Since I love the Beatles and the song selections are excellent (from the sad, beautiful &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; to the rousing &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; and a Harrison composition, &quot;I Need You&quot;), I gave this one 5 stars.<br />The Beatles are here to stay, yeah, yeah, yeah!
B00003CX5P|4.0|May 19th 1999, you saw it on Theaters. January 2000, you enjoyed it on VHS with a production featurette. But this is the most complete Star Wars video release ever, thanks to the power of DVD technology. George Lucas has embedded so much material in the two discs, that even die-hard Star Wars fans will be delighted for hours and hours. In fact, no other DVD I own has blown me away like this. Where to start?<br />Disc One obviously contains the feature; subtitles, anamorphic widescreen and commentary by George Lucas and company included -the standard stuff, if you may. Non-standard, however, is the fact that you can link to hidden StarWars.com material by having the DVD on your computer's DVD-ROM tray, namely access to large-screen versions of a couple of already-released trailers of Episode II, and exclusive (until the time of this writing) access to yet another trailer for the upcoming continuation of the saga.<br />Disc 2, though, is where most of the really cool material in the DVD is to be found, for those who like and those who dislike the movie, as well. To begin with, a full documentary containing all deleted scenes (some of them will actually make you hate the movie's editor!) along with interviews with Francis Ford-Coppola and a couple more great Directors/Editors, to hear the opinions about the whole process of editing a movie once it's been filmed in its entirety.<br /> The best part of Disc 2, however, is an all-new hour-long documentary shot during the production of the movie, that will captivate everyone. Complementing it are a 12-part award-winning Web documentary and five featurettes that go over more details about the pre-production/production of the movie. Some of its parts also made it to the full-length documentary, but essentially they're different pieces. Among the interesting things you get to see are what the crew had to go through when a desert storm blew away all their stuff, what Lucas called &quot;bad droid karma&quot; (all the history of technical complications around R2-D2) and how the brilliant final duel between Darth Maul and the Jedis was staged.<br />Altogether George Lucas has opened up like never before, offering the movie within the movie, and showing why he is, in Liam Neeson's words &quot;one of the world's greatest storytellers.&quot; Get a copy of this DVD: it has to be part of your movie collection, if not for the movie itself (which most people tend to agree as not being the best SW movie), for all the hours of pre-production and production material you can enjoy on it.technical complications around R2-D2) and how the brilliant final duel between Darth Maul and the Jedis was staged.<br />Altogether George Lucas has opened up like never before, offering the movie within the movie, and showing why he is, in Liam Neeson's words &quot;one of the world's greatest storytellers.&quot; Get a copy of this DVD: it has to be part of your movie collection, if not for the movie itself (which most people tend to agree as not being the best SW movie), for all the hours of pre-production and production material you can enjoy on it.

B00005QG9J|5.0|Owning almost all of Incubus' albums, this one shows how talented each member of the band truly is.  Incubus is a band that not only has a good singer or a good lead guitar, but in this album shows how awesome Dirk, Jose and Kilmore are at what they do.  &quot;Morning View&quot; also adds a different dimension to Incubus' style.  Some fans are disappointed with the &quot;softer&quot; feel of the album, but that's why Incubus is a good band...they can belt it out when they want to like on the &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E&quot; album, they can prophesize on how to really live life like on &quot;Make Yourself&quot; and they can play poetic soothing rock like on this new album.  Incubus is a real versatile band.
B00003CXTG|4.0|the love story isn't great, but it's not THAT bad. And the battle scenes are the best arial attacks you'll ever see!
B00003CXXJ|4.0|I really enjoyed Shrek.  I first saw it with my friend, but I decided to go back a second time with my little sister.  The movies has a good plot, and it is really entertaining!!
B00000IQMT|3.0|For any Star Wars fan TPM did not live up to the expectations of the first three movies and the soundtrack follows suit. John Williams is of course brilliant again in the next chapter of the Star Wars saga but I was sadly disappointed by the CD. First of all one of the titles of the tracks gives away a huge plot secret that really ruined the ending of the movie for me. Duel of the Fates is by far the best track on the CD. Anakin's theme is not as catchy as Yoda's or Princess Leia's theme from the earlier soundtracks. Not the best Star Wars soundtrack but then again TPM isn't the best Star Wars movie.
B00003Q43A|4.0|Ah, for the days when aliens would attack our cities and all the world would unite against a common, otherworldly foe.<br />What with all that has happened recently I can't see that sort of cooperation between countries as easily as I used to.<br />Anyhoo, this was a fun film on many levels. The special effects were great (but then again they'da have to be theses days), the story was - ahem - simple but that seems to be a good thing. Will Smith played his flyboy character well; a sort of 'Freash Prince of the Air'. Jeff Goldblum was was fine (although I felt at times his character might have been added in a later draft), and Bill Pullman was great. I had never really seen him as leading man material before this film. His rallying speech to the remaining pilots at the final battle was inspiring (note: the first time I saw this film I cried during the speech, but to be fair I was drunk at the time).<br />The aliens are appropriately nasty, the win is slightly unbelievable - but not by too much. And the tarnished hero/father figure rising to the occasion was a nice touch.<br />A good film, worth buying and watching now and again.
B000002KHH|5.0|What can be said about the founding fathers of modern metal. These guys rival Led Zeppelin is terms of greatness, and are tied in my book in the catagorie of best hard rock/metal band ever. Any rockers who considers themselves a rocker must pay tribute to Black Sabbath. These guys started it all and continue to do it today.<BR>THE GOOD: Is there a limit to the number of good things about this album? Nope, this is the one that made this band. 1)CLASSIC SONGS. Every song on this one rocks and rocks hard. The listener can really feel how ticked off these guys are. War Pigs is hands down one of the best songs ever written and always makes my head bang. Planet Caravan is a trippy, entracing song that will take you to another world. 2)LYRICS. These guys can do it all. The words are deep, meaningful, AND have emotion! What else could you want? THE BAD: 1) OZZY. If you do not like his voice today, then you will not like it back then either. <BR>THE BOTTOM LINE: If you do not own this one or have a burned copy in your collection, smack yourself around and then go out and buy it....well, wait until you regain consciousness before driving. This album is a \\"must have\\" album FOR ANYBODY!
1884822312|5.0|I would say this is the best chess book I've seen my whole life, and the one that took my playing really up in very little time.<br />You won't find any text in the book, just diagrams with mates in one, two, and three moves, and that is what's going to make you a better player, forget all the opennings books.<br />Just to tell you what happened to me thanks to this book, I was a 1200 player on the Internet, after spending my time with this book and solving five puzzles every day, after a month I became a 1700 player, and each time I dropped the book, my Internet rating dropped with it, but went up again after I started solving puzzles again.<br />Unfortunately I haven't been able to play much for a while because of work, but I can assure you that if you solve five puzzles every day of the more that 3,000 that are in this book, your game will improve dramatically in no time.
B00005U2LM|1.0|As a life long fan of Hardcore Underground Hip Hop, I am Becoming more and more disillusioned with the apparent lack of effort being put into the latest albums from the wu-tang and others like mobb deep and Nas.  As much as I Wanted to like this album i found myself straining to understand where their music is now comming from.  Where on earth has that unique wu-tang style of production gone, because it clearly is not evedent on this album. The Thing that seems to be missing most is the HUNGER they used to have to want to do their best and be the best in the game.  May-be  I should take my misplaced loyaly to the Wu, Mobb Deep, Nas, and other well established RAP artists and  invest it in other up-and-comming artists who show no such contempt for their fans and perhaps show a bit more hunger in the the quality of their music
0140187650|5.0|Hannah Arendt's book is a powerful and disturbing account of the trial of Adolf Eichmann, and the subtitle, A Report on the Banality of Evil, couldn't be more apt. According to Ms. Arendt, Eichmann wasn't an evil fanatic but just an unquestioning bureaucrat who felt very proud of his achievements, a person who thought his professional advancement was more important than the lives of millions of people. Without shifting any responsiblity from the Nazi leadership, Ms. Arendt argues that if society at large hadn't consented and in many cases cooperated, the extermination of human beings in such an enormous scale could have never been accomplished. Eichmann always maintained that he didn't agree with his superiors' policy, but he didn't disobey or even question his orders and eventually became one of the key figures in the deportation of millions of people from the occupied countries to the extermination camps in Eastern Europe.<br />The book also includes a lot of information about the reactions to the deportations in different countries, ranging from the zealous cooperation of the Poles to the admirable refusal of the Danes who eventually managed to save all their Jews by transporting them to neighbouring Sweden. Ms. Arendt has a very clear, analytic and eminently readable style and her book is an essential work that should be read by anyone who wants to know more about the implementation of the Final Solution and the personality and ideas of one of the individuals that made it possible.
B000002I2I|5.0|Morrison Hotel is hands-down my favorite Doors album.  They went back to the Blues on this album.  And I really doubt LA Woman would have been as good as it was without Morrison Hotel.  This album also has my FAVORITE Doors song, Peace Frog (my second favorite being The Soft Parade).<br />Many people would argue that their first album, The Doors, or their second album, Strange Days, is better than Morrison Hotel.  I would have to agree that both of those albums are great.  But after two so-so albums, Waiting For The Sun and The Soft Parade, (even though I think they are really good albums, most people do not like them), I think the Doors found their sound again.  With songs like Roadhouse Blues, Waiting For The Sun, Peace Frog, Queen Of The Highway, Indian Summer, I'm A Spy, You Make Me Real, etc., this album is AWESOME.  I listen to all their stuff all the time, but Morrison Hotel gets the most spins on my CD player.  Last Christmas, I bought 15 copies and gave them to friends as Christmas presents.<br />I think EVERYONE, Doors fan or not, should listen to this album.  If you haven't heard it, or haven't heard it lately, you're missing out on some fine tunes.
B000002KNI|3.0|Simon and Garfunkel were one of popular music's finest acts; their sixties canon is as impressive as any, thanks to Paul Simon's incredible songwriting talent and Art Garfunkel's evocative tenor harmonies. In the seventies, Simon showed himself to be a solo artist of great distinction. Then in 1981, Simon had plans to do a solo concert in Central Park and somehow it turned into a S&amp;G reunion: one which never went any further than this concert, as no new duo projects were forthcoming. Thus, what we get is a curious mix of a Simon solo concert with Garfunkel contributing, and a S&amp;G nostalgia walk down memory lane. The large band that plays behind them in this extravaganza is top notch, but it is evident from the filmed footage of the concert (with terrible makeup jobs on the stars) that Paul and Art aren't really relating to each other; they chat with the band or the audience but barely look at each other in between the numbers, and seem ill at ease sharing the stage. Still, they turn in professional performances of most of their big hits, along with many of Simon's seventies tunes. I guess the overall feeling I get from this album is that it might have been fun to be in the audience at this show, but if I want to hear Simon and Garfunkel I would much rather listen to their original recordings. The live versions contribute nothing to the songs that isn't on their original records (except maybe the live energy of Simon's 70s rocker &quot;Late in the Evening&quot; and the extra harmony Garfunkel adds to &quot;Slip Sliding Away&quot;; this is also a good place to hear Art's beautiful solo song &quot;A Heart in New York.&quot;) Instead of this ephemeral product, I suggest you get a copy of their box set &quot;Old Friends&quot; which showcases their growth, both live and in the studio, through the period of their true collaboration. (The box set also has superb sound quality.)
0385505833|5.0|Finally, just in time for the hollidays, we recieve the pleasure of a novel that isn't afraid to fly in the face of custom.  In a bit of a detour from his usual writing, John Grisham has created a work that is as much a social commentary as it is a family drama.  It was clear that the blatant commerciality of our culture was the real catalyst that ignited this work, and, much like Ben Jonjak's recent brilliant novel &quot;Glorious Failure&quot;, &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; delivers a piercing social assesment.  Contrary to &quot;Glorious Failure&quot;, Grisham's work lacks teeth in the denoument.  However, it is still a provocative read, and well worth the time.
6303433766|5.0|I first saw &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; on VHS a couple of weeks ago. I was absolutely blown away. It was deeper than the Pacific ocean and had so many intriguing layers, levels and textures. I just couldn't get the story out of my head for days afterwards.<br />I have since purchased the video and watched it several times. It does not lose its power to delight, confound, amuse, shock and upset. Yet it is so exquisitely tasteful and empathetic of its subject - never exploitative or gratuitous.<br />The acting is outstanding, particularly Melanie Lynskey, Kate Winslet and Sarah Pierse. They are ably assisted by a magnificent script and virtuoso direction. The presentation is so audacious, so imaginitive, it borders on genius. Respect due to Peter Jackson, Frances Walsh and the rest of the team.<br />Most reviews here (90%) give this film a full 5 stars. I have to agree. &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; is an incredibly good film. I'm talking a first-rate classic here. And I'm not generally given to using superlatives! I'm kicking myself for missing its theatrical release, and the fact that it's taken over six years for me to see it for the first time. 90% topscoring reviews speaks for itself. I strongly recommend that you buy this wonderful film.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|The Rainbow Children is an interesting piece of work by anybody's standards. <br />The experimentation and innovation on the Rainbow Children is to be applauded; he is undoubtedly trying to venture into new territory, both musically and lyrically. Very few musical artists today take these sorts of chances - with the exception of David Bowie, Lou Reed and Nick Cave.   <br />Much has been written about Prince's so-called slide into musical irrelevance; his slide from the mainstream; his diminishing importance as a chart force. To some extent, this is a reasonable view to hold. But on another level, many misunderstand where Prince is coming from and, perhaps more importantly, where he is seeking to go. <br />It is understandable why many have treated and will treat the Rainbow Children with disdain and bewilderment. It sounds different. It feels different. Its lyrics and social commentary are confronting. In parts, it is also laced with humour and wit. It is also, at times, confusing. It is not easily accessible. These factors are anathema to the pop music formula. But Prince is not trying to make pop music, at least not the kind that permeates radio airwaves.                <br />The musical structures, multiple bridges and segueways are nothing short of astounding.    <br />Prince is alive, and the musical world is a better place for it.
B000002JSP|1.0|I do not find any of good albums in this syntesizer versions,...<BR>Led Zeppelin tried to make a pop scene, but left their legacy from the first three albums.
B00005OM4N|3.0|I shall try to be objective in rating this latest effort from Ms. Spears. I have no particular love or hatred for her, which inevitably colors many of the reviews below. I am a fan of popular music, and have given this a careful listen. I believe it would be unfair to say that Britney cannot sing - she obviously has some kind of trained pop voice, able to make funky passionate moans that sound more appropriate to an older woman, as well as girlish singing tones. Furthermore, there is some cleverness to the many overdubs of Britney's voice, injecting some stereo complexity into the proceedings. Obviously this album hews pretty closely to the formula of Britney's previous two albums, complete with the requisite (audacious) cover of a classic song, in this case Joan Jett's &quot;I Love Rock and Roll.&quot; (This version I found surprisingly tame, given the firey nature of the original.) There is also the simple-beat, heavily background-vocalled radio hit, &quot;Overprotected,&quot; which is probably the album's best track, if only for its sheer upbeat energy and clarity of production. Over much of the album I grew weary of the tinny, overmanipulated digital sound; after a while my ears hurt from the fractured computer dance beats and synthesized backing tracks. The syrupy ballad &quot;Not a Girl&quot; alleviates this with some violins and a piano, but this sounds like a conventional imitation of Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston rather than anything original. &quot;Let Me Be&quot; has a good catchy melody, but I found many of the others rather forgettable. Also, all of the songs end the same way - suddenly. In the end, I will say that we all know this music to be a product rather than high art, but if we look at its intended audience of third-6th grade girls, we find a passable product. Parents would be wise to look, listen and decide for themselves whether they find Britney's onscreen gyrations or suggestive purrs to be a bad influence. (Was Mick Jagger a bad influence?) The lyrics of many of these songs are about finding one's own identity, a hackneyed but always relevant teen theme that can do no harm in and of itself.

B00005QIPH|5.0|Ok so maybe it's four stars if you think we don't need another band that revives the joy of '77 NYC. But I am not one of them. Much is made about how The Strokes'lead singer Julian channels Reed and Iggy. But it is intonation not imitation. The band takes their influences and create something that is infectious and original. I don't give a damn where they came from or who they know. It is bracing to hear something so unconcerned with the been there done that name check of the current indie scene. Sure I am concerned that they don't make the same album a zillion times but you could find much worse sounds to base a career on.<BR>As long they continue to expand the sound and the lyrics, I will be one happy fool.Give it a couple a listens before you pass final judgement and, I am certain that these songs will get stuck in your head. It is pop in the purest sense, just give into the vibe. If I had to pick an album that it reminds me of I would say <BR>Sloan's seminal power pop album One Chord Leads to Another, though not as diverse.Don't overthink it and you will discover a totally inspired and ingratiating listen which has just the right balance of bite and beauty.
B000002JSR|3.0|the final studio recording with ZEP, and then they had split, of course the die hard and blind fans always said that this album is a good one,....think logically buddy! CODA is not the best of their album <BR>I only like one track bonzos montreaux in this cd.
0786867973|5.0|This absolutely extraordinary cookbook is a Godsend.  After a long day at the office I come home, crack the book and flow into the relaxing rhythm of its recipes.  The author calmly walks me through the process of creating masterpieces of culinary comfort.  How about a steaming, aromatic potato, parsley and leek tart on a cold winter's night, or a layered butterscotch cake, dripping with heavenly goo? <br />Recipes, heretofore, considered best left to experts, are made ridiculously simple.  Consider Nigella's puff pastry, a thing of beauty.  It is produced (using a food processor, no less!) in one quarter of the standard time required in other recipes.  As a matter of fact, this puff pastry is the only one I've ever made successfully, and it was a cinch.  My husband and children went nuts when I pulled it from the oven.  I just sat back and reaped the accolades.
B00005U2LM|5.0|Alright, I was just a bit skeptical when I heard Wu-Tang was coming out with a new album, barely a year since their last release, AND right before Christmas.  In short, this may be nothing more than a ploy to make some extra cash so these guys can buy a few more Christmas presents.  Well, even if it is, I can't ignore the fact that this album is beautiful.  Absolutely beautiful.  After last year's &quot;The W,&quot; which was by no means a bad effort from the Clan, but really lacked everything we have come to love about them, I really began to lose hope that Wu-Tang would ever recapture the glory of &quot;36 Chambers&quot; and &quot;Forever.&quot;  But as I was listening to the first few tracks on this CD, my mouth was literally hanging open.  I don't think we'll ever get back to those glory days, but these might actually be new glory days.  It seems that on the last two albums, Wu-Tang has been trying to get those five mics, and while &quot;Forever&quot; was a serious contender for that honor, &quot;The W&quot; was not even close.  But here, it seems as though the Clan has forgotten about trying to please everyone and have simply gone back to making music.  The lead single, &quot;Uzi&quot; is just dope, with RZA's production including a slammin' horn section.  &quot;Iron Flag&quot; and &quot;Dashing (Reasons)&quot; also show off some of RZA's best production ever, even though it's simplistic production.  But that's why people were drawn to his beats in the first place.  &quot;Iron Flag&quot; in particular is great as it showcases two entirely different beats spliced together.  The second half of the song with the &quot;Good thing we brought the glock&quot; chorus is hardcore.  &quot;Chrome Wheels,&quot; &quot;Rules,&quot; and &quot;One of These Days,&quot; are just incredibly fun, reminiscent of the rugged energy of their first productions.  And &quot;Babies&quot; is the best contemplative Wu-Tang song in years.  It sounds like it belongs on Disc 2 of &quot;Forever.&quot;  Finally, this album probably has the best beginning of ANY of their CDs.  &quot;In the Hood&quot; immediately sets the standard very high, a standard that is consistently realized throughout the album.  Not a single track on this CD falls flat.  &quot;Iron Flag&quot; is what &quot;The W&quot; should have been.  It succeeds at every point &quot;The W&quot; failed.  This album should be in contention for the best album of the year, even rivaling Jay-Z's &quot;The Blueprint.&quot;  Any real hip-hop fan MUST cop this CD, as it is amazing from start to finish.  No doubt it will earn a place as a hip-hop classic, and even more importantly, a Wu-Tang classic.  Ya'll Been Warned.
B00005NWM3|1.0|&quot;How You Remind Me&quot; is definitely one of the catchiest songs of the year and I bought this CD because of it.  Unfortunately, except for &quot;Never Again&quot;, the rest of the songs are boring and sound the same.  The band has potential, but they only offer a glimpse of it here.  Assuming you're interested because of the single, I'd suggest checking out the Transmatic album.  Not as heavy, but you'll find a CD full of songs as captivating as the song that brought you here.
B00005U2LM|5.0|I´ve listened the entire album yesterday and I was impressed. After &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot; and &quot;The W&quot; which was a bit disapointed, finally Staten Island´s legends comeback with a banga!! This CD is their best since the classic &quot;Enter The Wu-tang 36 Chambers&quot;, maybe it´s the fact they recorded entirelly in NYC, I don´t know but it´s an enjoyable listening form beggining to end, so I guess this is the best album of the year, it´s better than &quot;The Blueprint&quot; and &quot;Stillmatic&quot;.<br />Unfortunatelly there´s no ODB on it but at least Cappadonna, who was never a clan member, doesn´t rap in any song!! Instead of buying that (...) &quot;Bulletproof Wallets&quot; by Ghostface, by &quot;Iron Flag&quot;, it´s much better!!<br />The WU is baaaaaaackkkkk!!!!!
B000002MX7|5.0|This is one great cd.  It's absolutley the best of everything.  Her vocal range is amazing and she really shows it off in Night in Tunisia and I Know You, I Live You (love those cuts!).  She is wonderful with Bruce Hornsby in Love Me Still (such a romantic song).  This is one cd that allows you to enjoy the Chaka we've come to know and love.  It's a classic you always want to keep around and that you never grow tired of.  Vocally, she's second to none.
B00003CXXI|5.0|I think I laughed harder and louder than my son when we went to see this movie at the theater.  I couldn't wait for it to come out on tape.  I've lent it to everyone I know who hasn't seen it and so far everyone loves it!
B000050XEI|5.0|After a long, mind-numbing, strenuous day at work or school, all you want to do is lie down and relax, correct? Well, if that's the case this is the C.D. for you. A Day Without Rain, by Enya, is a wonderful C.D. that relaxes the mind, body, and soul. Unlike any other musical artist, Enya sings with an angelic voice without straining her voice to make a sound that isn't natural for her. I believe that this C.D. would be enjoyed by anyone, even if this weren't his or her type of music. It is a wonderful C.D. that is highly recommended to anyone who is willing to try.
0064407667|3.0|I am 16 and found this book very enjoyable, but I do not think that it is appropriate for the age level that is suggested. A grown man wanting to marry a 14-year-old girl and an infant hanging from a cage is not something I would want a 10-year-old reading about. Other than that, I found the book witty and a fun read. Lemony Snicket is a wonderful writer.
B00005JKES|3.0|Twin Peaks is a great show, and I cannot add any unique praise.  But where the heck is the Pilot?  Episode one of the DVD starts out &quot;...previously on Twin Peaks...&quot; The creators of this set really missed the mark by omitting the pilot.  Also, a good navigable menu is really nice, but this one is not designed well.  I'm sure we will watch it over and over, nonetheless. So 5 stars for an interesting show and 1 star for the DVD itself.
B00005QGAX|5.0|this album really has alot of hits.  this was michaels time right here.  with the moonwalker movie and all.  he really shined during this time. i liked all of them except the one with stevie, it sounds tooooooooo pop.  i even like the bonus tracks fly away sounds kind of like elevator music but i still liked it.  street walker sounds like some down home country/r&amp;b kinda rock.  i still liked it too.
0671042858|3.0|I consider this the worst book by King that I've read (please note that I haven't read many bad King books).  It was way too short so there was no time to really develop a relationship with the character.  I found myself not caring whether or not Trisha lives or dies.<br />I gave it three stars because I think there is potential in the idea.  The plot was interesting at first, but King has an inherent tendency to add little supernatural twists to his plots.  This story would have been great if he had kept it completely real and possible.  The survival techniques of little girls is a fascinating story by itself; King just threw the integrity of that concept away by adding the weird-creepy-following-monster into it.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Finally the enthralling fantasy that is Willow is released on DVD!  Now when is the Star Wars trilogy arriving??  Anyway, this is definitely one of my favorite fantasy movies of all time.  The movies Legend and Krull are also great, but don't have the enrapturing quality that all of George Lucas's movies seem to have.  The movie follows a Nelwyn farmer, Willow, that is dreaming of becoming a sorcerer.  Through a matter of fate he becomes the guardian of a baby, the one prophecied to save the world. During the film he meets Val Kilmer's character, who is reluctant but helps Willow nevertheless, and a couple of teeny-tiny rodents that provide the humor in the story.  He also finds help where he least expects in the form of a beautiful young lady, that is actually the Queen Bavmorda's daughter.  In his journey to save the babe he goes through many seriously risky situations, one that includes a mutated dragon.  <br />The plot line is excellent and the dialogue goes from serious to funny without breaking any seams.  The plot seems to contain some elements of the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, but it combines them well and creates a movie that stands firmly on its own.  Excellent movie recommended for fans of Tolkien, Lucas, and any fantasy adventures.  Buy it today, its a great Christmas gift. <br />Now if they would only make movies out of the novel sequels...
B00003CXTF|5.0|This is one of the best movies i have ever seen.  even knowing that it was part love story, i still liked it.  it's well worth the money no matter what other people say.
B0000047CW|5.0|I try not to give five star reviews lightly, but in this case the temptation is too strong to resist.  The mood is a relaxed, peaceful, vaguely sybaritic. There is enough rhythmic excitement here to keep the music from being labelled new age, but the album has the same aversion to disonance or hard rock beats that we associate with new age music. The musicianship is first rate, with the interplay between band members a joy to experience. I never seem to tire of this album. This is melodic music with enough musical sophistication to avoid ever becoming cloying. One of my favorite jazz albums.
B00005U2LM|4.0|This album by Wu-Tang has it's facts of being a great rap group. This album is no where near classic but is still a good album. This album is about 10X better than THE W. THE W was just a joke to many Wu fans and I felt very dissapointed in Wu but now that they came back strong with album declaring that they are back is great.
0783229526|2.0|It has been said of Fear &amp; Loathing that either you get it or you don't.  I got it, all right.  It plays like a comic strip with unpleasant characters turning mundane situations into vehicles for crime and folly.  Parking a car, entering a bar, watching a motorcycle race, etc. become major &quot;plot points,&quot; as our drugged-up drunk heros render themselves incompetent for these simple tasks.  They berate each other, threaten each other with knives and mace, and likewise threaten innocent bystanders.  Meanwhile the narration, laid on with a trowel in homage to the book from which it is taken verbatim, struggles pathetically to impose a higher meaning on these daft proceedings.  <br />Ralph Steadman's grotesque illustrations for the book are accurately realized in the film, and this is the root of the problem.  Steadman drew caricatures of the book's characters; the film brings these caricatures to life as though they are realistic, Rockwell-like portraits of the characters -- and this fatal misrepresentation sinks the film.  Burlesque is diluted with meditation, and as a result the film is neither amusing nor enlightening.  <br />The film is entirely superficial, but even so it veers between hallucinatory distortion and gross caricature, leaving the viewer to wonder at the mental age of the people responsible for this farce.  Alas, some very talented people were involved, not least of whom is Hunter S. Thompson, and they all should hang their heads in shame.    <br />This movie has its share of funny scenes, but five minutes of amusement won't justify two hours of Fear &amp; Loathing.  The scene with Dr. Gonzo vomiting over the side of his convertible as he cruises The Strip, while screaming gibberish about Vietnam and heroin at a carful of middle-aged tourists, is alone worth the two stars I've awarded the film.  But overall, Fear &amp; Loathing is a major disappointment.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Having been an undergraduate-graduate-post graduate during the entire VietNam period, it was not possible for me to watch Apocalyse Now when first released, even though it was then seven years since the war ended. The entire VietnNam era is, for many of us, the defining moment of our generation. Talking with my now adult children (who are now older than I was when the war ended) I realize how totally incapable they are of understanding not only the war itself, but American history, politics and culture. Events of the immediate past (i.e. 9/11) seem to be unfathomable. Without a comprehensive understanding of our history, how could it be otherwise?<br />To many of us, there was never so much as a centilla of doubt that the VietNam war was sheer, total insanity. Looking at Coppola's work at this remove brought back a welter of emotions and memories like a very bad acid trip. Coppola has caught the essence of the zeitgeist to perfection. Since I have not (and will not) see the original version, I can not compare version &quot;A&quot; to version &quot;B.&quot; Judging purely on the basis of version &quot;B&quot; I can say that this film will either ring entirely true to the core, or it will baffle you thoroughly. In this one instance, this fictionalized history-as-allegory does not trivialize or make mawkish, or be plainly disprespectful to the subject. <br />I've read of the apparent inconclusiveness of the end of the film, of the dramatic and logical murk surrounding the final appearance of Kurz (Marlon Brando). It seemed perfectly logical to me, in a Lewis Carroll sort of way. VietNam was NOT about logic, and was certainly NOT about patriotism or fighting for democracy. I can still see Lyndon Johnson's face on Huntley-Brinkley, and those late night pictures of self-immolation clearly in my mind. Time has not diminished the horror of it all.<br />It's good to see a &quot;war&quot; movie portraying things as they were perceived by the entire generation. The only otherfilm of this genre that I can think of in the same breath would have to be &quot;King of Hearts&quot;- which, in its more symbolic theater of the absurd manner of presentation, is also as horrifying. I would recommend viewing both of these films back to back.
B00005QK3W|4.0|First, a modest rebuttal: &quot;Freedom&quot; is &quot;reactionary&quot;? Is there any possible outrage, then, that would justify a forceful response? I was so glad Paul didn't come out and do &quot;Give Peace a Chance.&quot;<BR>&quot;Driving Rain&quot; continues a string of strong albums by Paul going back to &quot;Flowers in the Dirt.&quot;  Musically, very fresh, very spontaneous, inventive. Lyrically, very direct, very personal. &quot;From a Lover to Friend&quot; can be criticized as nonsensical, but I really think it expresses his confusion over the loss of Linda and the arrival of Heather Mills in his life. I think that's why he left it as it is, whether he thought it through that deliberately or not, I don't know. Personal favorites: &quot;Lonely Road,&quot; &quot;Spinning on an Axis,&quot; &quot;Tiny Bubble,&quot; and &quot;Back in the Sunshine Again.&quot; All classic McCartney. I've been surprised by the negative reaction of some apparently longtime McCartney fans, despite the good published reviews.  It's hard for me to imagine that anyone who has enjoyed Paul over the years won't like this album a lot.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Of all the albums I own, and I own quite a few, nothing pleases me more than a listen to OK Computer. It has a texture and sound that, in my opinion, has no match. This is simply the best album I own and will probably ever own. I deeply love it.

B00005Q3TZ|5.0|First of all, Pearl Harbor is the greatest film ever made. Everything about it was absolutely amazing, and the DVD is even better!<br />The sound, picture, even the moving menu and chapter selections make it incredible. Even if you hated the movie (shame on you!) I'd buy the DVD for the extras, as well as the sheer work put into making it.
B00003CXIY|5.0|Road Trip is definitely one of my FAVORITE movies EVER! It is just SO incredibly funny! I can and HAVE watched it REPEATEDLY, sometimes 2 to 4 times in a single week! It's one of those movies you can watch again & again & never get sick of!I LOVE IT!
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is one must have DVD, everyone who owns a player should have a copy, its that good. The film is ouite honestly fantastic despite what all those magazine reviews say, i cant see why anybody would knock this,it appeals to all age groups, male or female. The romance element is in there for the ladies but is always followed with somthing for the guys to snigger at, its not the funniest of films but you can get a bit of a laugh from it. Then theres the action sequnce, 45 minutes of non stop pure action packed errr.... action, the guys will love it and the girls will cry as some of their most loved characters meet their maker, everyone will love it. The special features are great, toghther with the film they make a great gift for you or someone else. A must have in your collection
0385505833|5.0|I loved this book. John did a great job in relating the feelings a lot of people have about the drudgery of the Holidays. I related to Luther and his feelings. I can not imagine anyone not enjoying this short story. In the end I think what Luther did for the neighbors and his family deserved applause. I will be keeping this book to read again.
B00005U2LM|5.0|That's all I need to say! 'Bout Bloody Time!
B00004T9UF|5.0|...You must not have heard it yet.  Some eminem haters may be offended by eminem's violent emotional bloodbath of explicit lyrics and/or turned off by his seemingly &quot;negative&quot; attitude, but it's hard to deny the sheer passion and raw emotion deeply woven into his music.  With seismic bass and gripping hooks enjoyed everywhere from boom boxes on the doorsteps of urban streets to shiny new hi-fi's in cozy suburbia, this album speaks to the masses.  Anyone who has ever felt angry/frustrated/depressed/violent but couldn't find a satisfying expression for their emotion should listen to this album.  Otherwise, just listen because the album is so darn good.
068818071X|5.0|Each time I finish a book by Keyes I declare it her best work; Rachel's Holiday is certainly no exception. This is one stellar book. As in some of her other works, Keyes takes a very serious subject (in this case drug addiction) and writes about it a way that is comical without making light of the situation. She is able to take the edge off of a touchy subject with a sprinkle of humor that makes her characters seem very real to life.  Even though I do not share her substance addictions, I do share many of the same moods, thoughts and attitudes of Rachel. Once again, Ms. Keyes has perfectly managed to capture the essence of many of the single young urban women out in the world today. Bravo!
0385505833|1.0|There's nothing in this book.  No marginally developed characters, no story, no nothing.  It's hard to believe!  Do yourself a favor, read this book and know, with certainty, that you've read the most worthless book you'll ever read.  As Pep Young once said, &quot;If you can't be the best at something, be the worst; there's distinction in both directions.&quot;
B00005QCVT|3.0|First off, let me say that Aronofsky is a talented director. He employs an impressive arsenal of camera shots, and he uses sound in interesting ways. These devices, however, aren't enough to conceal what is essentially a weak, flimsy story. I'll refrain from giving a synopsis, suffice it to say that the movie contains two narratives, both of which are propelled by causal relationships between events-- there are no twists, nor do the parallel stories ever really intersect. The action is very linear: the mother character wishes to lose weight, starts taking speed pills, is ruined. The youngsters use drugs, attempt to run a lucrative drug business, fail, are ruined. A leads to B. I think the attempt here is try to attribute causes to the story's developments. We're to believe that media has something to do with Burstyn's desires-- or is the television spot a means for her to regain the attention formerly given to her by her husband and son? It's hard to figure how these themes converge and what message the director is trying to instill.<br />One reviewer here interprets the film as a discourse on the ways people, numbed by the trappings of modern living, try to find meaning and feeling in their lives. Agreed, but there was another film in the past few years, Fight Club, that did a better job with that material. Aronofsky attempts to heighten the dramatic impact of mundane scenes with an intense, driven violin score. Again, this was done better, in my opinion, by another recent film, Anderson's Magnolia, which, granted, had better scenes and a more intricate plot to work with.<br />The upsides: great acting all around. The biggest surprise was Marlon Wayans, who peremptorily dispels any notion that he's only capable of second-rate, sophmoric schtick acting.<br />In sum, Aronofsky is a talented director with a sense of scene and visual cunning. He's sure to do well in the future, though I think this film missed the mark.<br />PS-- I refuse to moralize about the movie. Ididn't find anything nihilistic or gratuitous about it, and I think that drug use is a completely valid topic for a film, despite the entreaties of fellow reviewers. My only question is: did anyone else find this film's perspective on the medical establishment totally over the top? (Ellen B's character being force-fed, ECTed; *not* sedated and fed IV; initially prescribed speed pills by a seemingly aloof, disinterested doctor; Leto's character being discharged from the hospital to prison before his arm's healed...)
1556154844|5.0|Ever read books where you are only able to extract two good paragraphs of information in a span of one or more chapters?  Well, this book is a little different.<br />Whether you are a beginning or experienced software developer, you will find every page of infomation in this book worth your while to go through.  It first, points out the proper approach and guideline that sotware development should take.  Then it details on why and how, from both a theoretical and practical point of view, weighing trade-offs between ad-hoc and elegant design approaches.  Pointing out classical problems and pitfalls, and better means of avoiding them.  Also, a good short synopsis on factors to consider in deciding whether to use structured or object-oriented design in your design.(OOAD is not always the better choice, and it tells you why)<br />This book wont teach you how to write syntax or programming in any particular programming language, but it will equiped you with the necessary tools of design techniques and best practices before you write one-single line of code.  Software engineering(at times) is an inderministic process, which requires persistence, innovations and even(and definitely) brute force.  Having \\"Code Complete\\" will help you stay on the right path and better your chances of succeeding.  Buy it, read it, and read it again.  It doesn't require you to read it in any particular order and thus suits the experience level of any readers.  This book is also a viable tool for software managers that manage critical software systems.<br />The best (money)you will ever spend on a software book.  It will accelerate anyone's learning curve in the field of software engineering.  If you are a beginner, it will help you start off on the right foot in developing software.  If you are a experienced developer, it might point out some bad habbits that you might not realize that you are practicing.  It might offer better alternatives to your existing problem solving approach.  It certainly humbles me as a reader and an experienced developer on the idea there will always be better solutions to a problem out there.  Believe me, it will make a difference in the way you think and do things.  You will learn to appreciate the art of designing software and the world of software engineering.<br />Happy Reading!
0345440757|5.0|I am the mother of an 18-month old child.  My daughter didn't sleep the first two weeks of her life except in 15-minute increments.  She slept through the night once during her first 8-months.  I had been hearing about Tracy Hogg EVERYWHERE in books, on TV and from other parents, so I bought this book.  My daughter slept through the night the first night I got this book and became a very good sleeper almost immediately.  Everyone always says you have to do this and that to make your child sleep well but Tracy teaches you about sleep patterns, how a child falls asleep, how to tell when your child is ready for a nap or way past due and so much more.  Of course, there's lots more information than just about sleeping but that's the part that really helped me the most so that's what I remember the most.  There's also the EASY plan (wish I had known about that before the birth) and how to decipher what your baby is trying to tell you.  This book was unbelievably helpful to a first-time mom like me and the book is written like she is sitting in your living room having a conversation with you.  I recommend it highly and it has become my standard gift to first-time mom's at their baby showers.
0385486804|5.0|Krakauer's approach is sympathetic yet frank.  While he does not make excuses for a young man's follies, he does explore them with a deliberate understanding that enlightens the reader.  Tragic circumstances, tragic personalities, tragic endings are part of Krakauer's theme, but I really appreciated his delving into the motivations that drive this tragic character.  The reader will gain an insight into something as personal as another man's soul.<br />  Some may read this book and say it would not have been written if Alex/Chris had not perished, but I think it would have been written.  Maybe the story would not have revolved (or evolved) around the same man, but it would still tell the tale of a man (men) searching for something within himself only to discover it is without -- all too late.<br />  Alex is a personification of that urge in every man to live wild, to live free, to live worthy of what is before him.  The tragedy here is that Alex is a man, not just some literary invention.
B000005DQR|5.0|I thought that I didn't like hip-hop until I listened to this CD at a friend's place a few years ago.  After hearing this I saw that there was much more to hip-hip than what gets played on Top 40 and commercial hip-hop stations.  The strongest track is Midnight In A Perfect World.
0553269631|4.0|I don't wish to be harsh in my criticism of this fine novel.  It is a sweet, rather warm and intimite book where we focus mostly on the internal dialogue of numerous characters brooding.  This in itself tells us we are on an exploration of human emotion, as well as the thoughts, dreams, fantasies and excuses people tell themselves while contemplating their lives.  It is an honest story told with a passion so earnest you almost can't help but smile at the cute little girl who wrote such a pretty little story . . .<br />The writing is quite good in spots, adequete elsewhere and sometimes frequently awkward and uncertain.  One gleans that the author lacked confidence in her writing at times and overwhelms this lingering doubt with the repeated anxieties of everyone trying to bust out over the course of the novel.  This makes the book sometimes droning and dull, filled with gentle critque followed by panicked apologies.<br />Nevertheless it is a worthwhile read, a clear and blue-skied window into the heart of someone who can turn pain into sympathy right before your eyes.
0452282152|1.0|The style of writing in this novel was appropriate for a ten year old girl who is just beginning to read novels. I would not recommend this for adults.
0385505833|2.0|This was an &quot;okay&quot; book.  A quick read, very predictable, very contrived for the holiday season.  I would skip it.
0151003084|5.0|The concept behind \\"The Gashlycrumb Tinies; or, After the Outing,\\" by Edward Gorey, is brilliant in its simplicity. It consists of a series of rhymes about small children who suffer various deaths. Each child has a name beginning with a different letter of the alphabet, and their grim fates are arranged alphabetically by name. Each fate is also accompanied by one of Gorey's macabre drawings. Sample lines: \\"E is for Ernest who choked on a peach. F is for Fanny sucked dry by a leech. G is for George smothered under a rug. H is for Hector done in by a thug.\\"<br />I found this book hilarious. Gorey's children have a proper Victorian look to them which makes their scenarios that much more bizarre. Most of the drawings show the unfortunate children just before their deaths; only a few of the pictures actually show explicit death or violence.<br />One could read \\"Gashlycrumb Tinies\\" as an outrageous parody of children's books (of alphabet primers in particular), or just enjoy it for what it is. Either way, I think it's a wicked delight.
0140186395|5.0|This book is the reason I passed Junior English. The thickness at first turned me off but Steinbeck makes it so riveting I could not put it down. The character of Cathy Ames/Kate is the reason why I love this book. She is a disturbed evil being whom I love to hate and her actions make you want to read further to determine why she is the way she is. Cathy is one of the greatest characters I have read about in a long while
B00005QDW1|1.0|Ever since Gwenny decided to go YO YO DIGGIDY on everyone and sell out with this piece of ROCK STEADY garbage...the band went down hill trying to capitalize on Jamaican hip hop to sell an album. If they'd spend more time focused on the music rather than<BR>coating Gwen's face with so much make up to hide the legions of wrinkles...they'd fair much better! I miss the magic of &quot;simple kind of life&quot;. Talk about lowering standards...the drummer has to run around nude (which of course no one wants to see) to get attention in the &quot;Hey Baby&quot; video....sad kind of life...
B00003CXTG|1.0|Two and a half hours of my life gone forever.<br />At best Pearl Harbor is a chick-flick!  As it is the only person I know who really loved this movie is a 12 year old girl.  I shouldn't have to say any more than that, but I can't help it.  I feel cheated after paying to rent this movie.  To dedicate 90 minutes of my life to the most contrived love story I've ever endured for what I will have to say is the coolest battle scene I've ever seen, then the trashing of the Doolittle raid.  I'm insulted.  This could have been a great movie.  It could have informed and enlightened this generation.  Instead it's pure (...).  The events leading to Pearl Harbor are all but ignored and love takes center stage and it's nothing new.  <br />From writing to her lover from the beach at sunset to having sex with his best friend in a hanger full of parachutes I wretched at every twist and turn in the love story.  I hate that every movie made has to have a love story in it.  Take this subject and add a love story to give some human interest to a war story, but to make it a love story and gee, we're sorry the Japanese ruined your fun.<br />I don't want to give away the ending, but movies like this are what's wrong with this country.  Sending messages to the intended audience (12 year old girls) that it's ok to be in love with one person and have sex with his best friend and when you end up pregnant and the guy that got you that way isn't around any more your boyfriend will take you back and raise the baby.<br />If you know somebody that has this movie I would recommend borrowing it before you waste your money buying it... unless you have a really great home theater set-up, then you can forward the DVD to 1:24:00 and have a great time for 30 minutes.
B00005JKT8|4.0|The movie was overall very cute. It had much more potential, but then again for what it was it worked.
6304696515|4.0|there is something deeper about this movie (facile too) that could escape one's attention due to the fast-pace/high-stakes story. indeed, the game in itself is not fulfilling and its logical conclusion, pushed in the end, is devastating. the dialogues build rapidly a captivating plot whose  climax can come in two such different ways....
B00005QZWI|4.0|There are many avenues about this soundtrack worth examining and discussing. After all, with such great anticipation facing \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", how can anyone truthfully confess that he can help not wondering about how the music for the movie would turn out? Ideas and expectations abound: Could Peter Jackson acquire the Celtic pastoral feel he was gunning for? Or could fans expect something colder and more military sounding, something befitting of a movie of such epic proportions (literally)?<br />When Howard Shore signed on, I'm sure plenty were apprehensive about his ability in such relevance, while others were willing to give him an open opportunity. But the debate is sure to rage on, even with the release of this edited record of a three-hour soundtrack. One score to rule them all, or just one score to fall? It's anybody's guess.<br />On the one hand, to put it honestly, you hardly hear anything Celtic here (even with Enya around), except maybe for the occasional fiddle in \\"Concerning Hobbits\\". There's nothing very bright - or \\"pastoral\\" for that matter - about any of this music. It's very hard, very bitter, and even as you listen on, you can see how these pieces inevitably spiral towards the darker thematic side of J. R. R. Tolkien's story. It isn't entirely military, with rattling drums and soaring strings for the mere purpose of accompanying battle sequences, or the incidental monster encounter, but it isn't something you'll feel very cheerful listening to.<br />On the other hand, that might not be so bad. Very evidently, this is not a thematic soundtrack. This can be clearly demonstrated by undisputed comparison to the soundtrack of the other fantasy counterpart - John Williams' \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\". Throughout the latter you somehow hear \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" all the time. But with Howard Shore's immensely dark choral verses and dramatic orchestral backing (while giving him less room to build up a proper, impressive theme), there isgreat space for variation. Honestly, there is hardly any piece that sounds alike with another. From the very beginning, \\"The Prophecy\\" sets it straight: This is a musical voyage that's going to go grim. But interspersed with such grimness come moments of subtle mysticism, heartfelt poignancy, and sometimes plain excitement that hints of an omen of death. \\"The Shadow of the Past\\" actually suits very appropriately the tone of that part of the story. It grinds gloomily into the listener's mind how utterly sickening the Ring of Power can be, but it doesn't grind too hard. No - it kind of floats on for other bits of the soundtrack to pound you harder. \\"The Black Rider\\" is typical of a looming omen, almost vividly portraying the coming of the Ringwraith just through audible music. \\"A Knife in the Dark\\", \\"Flight to the Ford\\" and, the sure favourite, \\"The Bridge of Khazad-Dum\\", ignite the soundtrack with dark adventure, a race for life, and the ever ominous uncertainty of what has yet to come.<br />But Howard Shore really fleshes out his thirst for variety in all the vocal additions he has integrated quite cleverly into the music. Elizabeth Fraser's \\"Lament for Gandalf\\" in \\"Lothlorien\\" is aptly spooky and spine-tingling, and reminds you of how Enya creates her own ethereal voice. Though lyrics are included with the CD, the magic of this bit is that you never get to hear them sung clearly. It really is a lament, so to say - a mourning cry that is hauntingly - and surprisingly - melodious. <br />Enya's involvement in this project will undoubtedly come under fire. On one hand, it may not be anything new that we've heard from her, and it may not be so beautifully Celtic as we've come to expect from her. On the other hand, maybe that's just the right kind of sound Peter Jackson and Howard Shore were looking for. For example, \\"Aniron\\" slips in somewhere in \\"The Council of Elrond\\" so delicately, it's almost as if Enya had composed that very theme, careful not to break any of the accompanying strings. The end title theme song she composed - \\"May It Be\\" - may not be so lush with the air of Ireland. But, really, should she be doing Ireland, or Middle Earth? If you think about it, her music, with Roma Ryan's lyrics, brilliantly sum up everything that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" strives for: The painstaking fight for good over evil, and how love, courage and hope can give strength in such a battle.<br />But, really - in the end, it's anyone's guess. There isn't anything particularly musical for anyone to hang on to in this soundtrack. To one, it could be something merely dedicated to pounding eardrums, or even an exhibition of plagiarism from the likes of John Williams and crew. To another, it could be a bold attempt, a take on something hardly anyone would have expected for a beautiful movie, dark or otherwise. <br />Still, shouldn't you give it credit for provoking some thought?
B00005LOUS|5.0|Though I was surprised it wasn't identical to the original, I enjoyed this movie tremendously!  No one but Jim Carrey could have pulled off this part, his delivery of humor mixed in with the Dr. Suess dialog was priceless.  Great for all ages, especially some humor only adults could appreciate.  Precious story of the &quot;Real Meaning&quot; of Christmas.  This movie is a blessing of laughter.
B00005U2LM|5.0|The Wu-tang does it again!! Their last album the W was great album and so is this, but this time there ain`t no Nas, Busta, Snoop, or Redman and that means that every member get<BR>`s alot of mic time. There are no bad songs here but my favorites are: rules, soul power, uzi, ya`ll been warned, babies, radioactive, iron flag and the W (bonus track)
B000003N7K|5.0|The only complaint about this disc is that it's only 6 songs.  The conventional wisdom about Coltrane is that his ballad work  was forced by the record company to pay the bills.  If you listen to his whole career, this is just wrong.  Coltrane had a tender style with ballads, some of which he might have picked up from Miles Davis, some of which was quite personal.  This pairing, Johnny Hartman and the classic quartet, is near perfect.
B00005AXEL|5.0|She's still got it.  This is a VERY classy release.  Stevie's composition and lyrics are surprising, elegant, and genuine.  Her performances are superb, and the production is first class.  This is probably her best solo album ever.
B00005QK3W|4.0|I, too, have bought every album/cd post-Beatles that Paul has done.  I even own the Fireman thing he did a few years back.   But of late, for some reason, I had grown weary of him and his music.   Seems like he was always out with a new press release commenting on this or that and not really focusing on his music.<br />Okay, I was wrong.  I bought the CD out of tradition and thought I'd listen to it a couple of times and put it up as I have done so many times before.   Not this one.   The most useful thing I've read about this CD from another listener is a comparison to Sting.   I was taken aback by the mature, yet jazz-infused modern sound that is a welcome change from the rockabilly Paul so loves (which I like too, but it's great to hear something a little more current).<br />There's a great bluesy feel to some of the tracks, as well as clever lyrics.   &quot;Road to Jaipur&quot; has such an Eastern feel, you can't help but think about George.  Yes, it's almost all about L-O-V-E, but that's what the Beatles were about, so you can't fault him for being consistent over the years.<br />I heard him play &quot;From a Lover to a Friend&quot; at the Concert for New York and thought it was terrible.   The CD version is better.  And the additional track of Freedom is great.  It sticks with you.<br />Overall, the CD ranks as one of his best solo efforts, and probably his most consistent since BOTR.   If you're a fan, be proud...he did a great job!
B00005MP58|1.0|I love the novel.  I also love the A&amp;E produciton of the novel.  I agree with the other viewers on the script, acting--this version is simply wonderful.  However, the remastered version is awful.  The colors are so overly bright that they are almost washed out.  This DVD  is almost painful to watch.  I called A&amp;E customer service and spoke to Vickie who had heard about the problem but had not seen the DVD.  She didn't seem overly concerned and suggested the fault might be my DVD player.  I am hoping that A&amp;E gets a lot of complaints and then maybe they will do something about this problem.  As for now, my advice would be not to buy it.
B00005JKES|5.0|I must admit...it's very odd seeing these episodes in their natural color after spending so much time with the VHS edition...but that passed rather quickly! :-)  This is what I wanted to see - a good transfer, interesting extras...even the packaging is a treat.  Obviously, the lack of commentary by Lynch is a disappointment (although not a real surprise), but that aside (I've experienced some minor video glitchiness along the right edge of the screen, but I think that's my aging TV!), the only thing I can say about this edition is that I hope the remainder of the series is given this kind of fine treatment!  Great work, Artisan!
6303607942|3.0|Horowitz plays the concerto like he does; i love to watch him play anything, especcially something that is so difficult that, for him, looks so easy.  The recording is horrible though.  The balance between orchestra and piano is off, and there is a static sound much of the time.  I would not like to have this on CD, it would bother the heck out of me...Sounds like a home video recording.
6302054982|5.0|Martin Scorsese's masterpiece is one to be cherished,  valued,  and especially enjoyed over and over again.  Originally entitled WiseGuys from writer and co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi's novel,  this title was dropped because of the existence of a Brian De Palma comedy already called WiseGuys starring Joe Piscopo and Danny Devito.  That WiseGuys has NOTHING on GOODFELLAS!  Goodfellas is more than a movie.  It is an experience!  What made this movie so different from other mob movies was the fact that the mob was treated as a seperate race from society.  From the explosive beginning to the near-heartbreaking conclusion,  the mob has you in the palm of their hands.  (...) The movie is told through the eyes of Henry Hill,  who grows up under the wing of the mob after taking a part time job there at the cab stand,  the hangout for the hitmen,  bosses, paesaens,  and Italianos.  The plot is so intricate and vast,  that it would be impossible to go through it in its entirety.  To break down,  Hill(Ray Liotta) grows up a friend ally to Mob legend Jimmy Conway(Robert DeNiro) and psychotic killer Tommy(Joe Pesci) while always under the supervision of Paulie(Paul Sorvino).  Hill marries Karen(Lorraine Bracco) and through three decades of drugs,  money,  murder,  and sex,  the men and women lose and win,  are killers or killed,  thiefs or victims,  you name it,  Goodfellas has got it.  All of this is amazingly pulled together by one of the finest filmmakers of our time,  Martin Scorsese(co-writer/Director).  Above all other scenes and situations beautifully filmed,  none can compare to Scorsese's \\"coup de cinema\\" tracking shot.  Those of you who have seen the movie more than once will likely know what I'm talking about.  With \\"And then he kissed me\\" blaring, Karen and Henry enter the Copacabana from the side entrance and proceed into the night club  in an incredibly filmed camera tracking sequence which never once takes its eyes off Henry and Karen until they are comfortablysat in the front of the Copa's band.  It is a testament to the fact that Scorsese's genius and talent is beyond compare.  Speaking of music,  nearly everyone knows that it is difficult to imagine anyone besides Scorsese who can use music so ingeniously in film.  The opening Tony Bennett number \\"Rags to Riches\\" sets the tone immediately for the amazing film which has already begun,  and the soundtrack is a must-have.  Personal favorite:  the rock n' roll blasting as the camera closes in on Robert DeNiro smoking his cigarette only the way DeNiro can.  The cast is amazing,  with Robert DeNiro giving a great performance.  Ray Liotta is electrifying as Henry Hill.  Personally,  I was very dismayed when Liotta did not receive an Oscar nomination for that performance,  he basically carried a good deal of that film with excellent versatility.  Oscar winner Joe Pesci walked home with the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for his Tommy,  and Lorraine Bracco's strong-willed Karen was honored by a nomination and a great performance.  Paul Sorvino is cool and awesome as Paulie the boss,  and even Scorsese's parents get into the act,  his father playing the hitman who actually is responsible for Timmy's undoing,  and Catherine Scorsese plays Tommy's religious mother.  The scene in which Henry,  Tommy, and Jimmy end up at her house looking for a shovel to bury the man they nearly beat do death in the trunk,  she comes down and fixes each man a meal in one of the funniest scenes in the film.  Yes,  funny,  what makes this film so great is that there is a great deal of humor and it eases the tension of the viewer with a weak stomach.  Goodfellas was nominated for six Oscars,  including Best Picture and Best Director,  and was named Best Picture by the NY and LA Film Critics Association and the National Film Board Review.  It is absolutely one of the best films ever made,  and it stands mighty as number 95 on AFI's 100 best films of all time,  being placed among Platoon,  One FlewOver the Cuckoo's Nest,  Casablanca,  The Godfather,  Citizen Kane,  and Gone With  The Wind.  I love it!  Whatsamatta wit you?
0385505833|4.0|This is a funny, terribly true look at the way Christmas is performed by all too many people these days, myself included.  As you read about the manic, torturous and tacky preparations and commercial excesses for Christmas that take place in this community you'll feel like pulling your hair out, just like a real Christmas experience!  You'll feel overwhelmed and panicky and bored and slightly superior. You may get a twinge of the rebel spirit that the book's main character feels. The expense! The gauche decorations! The get-togethers with people you don't really relate to and the huge quantities of food and booze and work!  You'll feel the claustrophobic pressures of shopping and the rat-race will almost make you shriek!<br />  But then on Christmas Eve, the couple who has decided to skip Christmas faces a major emergency of hilarious proportions and the rat-race gets so much worse. I identified with Nora and Luther Krank and it just cracked me up the way our fed-up feelings dissipate under the magical power of the winter holidays.<br />  This book shows in a very witty, satirical and funny way that you can't easily skip Christmas because no matter what crazy trappings you foolishly muck it up with, it still comes shining through bearing its gifts of joy and community and love.<br />  This book has screenplay written all over it.  Read it and smile at yourself and the culture of Christmas.
B00005NWM3|3.0|This CD is good, and there are 2 or 3 possible hit-singles (I suspect 'Never Again' will be their next single), but as many reviewers have correctly pointed out, it does seem the same style is repeated over and over again.  In fact, you often find yourself listening to the same repeated-lyric several times in each song...simply because they could not put in any other lyrics.  Seems they are fond of repetition.  <br />But, if you can get beyond that, this CD is pretty good, but I was a little disappointed that the band would do such with their music. <br />If you like Staind, and Creed, you'll probably also like this CD. I would say your chances of liking this band above Staind or Creed are slim-to-none, but that does not mean you won't take a few songs off this CD when you burn your own &quot;My Favorite Songs&quot; CD.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Some superb SFX notwithstanding this is an thoroughly awful film. Totally predictable story line, wooden performances from self-absorbed actors not to mention a complete waste of some real talent (Cuba Gooding Jr, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore). For such a huge film this is pure garbage. A waste of time, film and money. One star only because I couldn't give it a zero. I want a refund!
B00005QCVT|2.0|Another overrated entry in the Quickly Becoming Tiresome &quot;junkie chic&quot; genre. A lonely widow (Ellen Burstyn) gets strung out on a &quot;Mother's Little Helper&quot; regimen of diet and sleeping pills prescibed by her quack physician. Meanwhile, her son (Jared Leto),his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his buddy (Marlon Wayans) are busy destroying thier lives with heroin. And that's our &quot;plot&quot;...Drugs Are Bad (ho-hum). With neither a compelling central narrative nor sympathetic character in sight, be prepared for a VERY long 2 hours. I was roped in by the hype surrounding Burstyn's performance, and while she is excellent as always, this is nowhere near her best work (check out &quot;King Of Marvin Gardens&quot; just for starters). Director Darren Aronofsky appears to be more determined to showcase his own visual technique over performances, so any subtle acting nuances are bludgeoned by annoying camera/editing tricks. There are far too many gross-out scenes (unless your idea of a good time at the movies includes watching beautiful Jennifer Connelly vomit into the camera, or a lingering close-up of a needle spiking into a pus-swollen abcess). The &quot;What...that's IT?!&quot; ending really puts the capper on an alltogether unpleasant movie experience.
B00004IC9G|5.0|I first heard Manowar's music back in 1985. At the time I was a huge Iron Maiden fan (Still am).But when I bought Battle hymns (On cassette- Ha Ha)and listened to it from beginning to end I knew I had me a new favorite group.I couldn't get enough of this album.It sounded unlike anything else out at the time(Even though it was 3 years old already). It did not have that Prototypical Heavy Metal sound to it either.In fact the first 4 tracks on the album are pretty much straight ahead Hard rock songs.The last 4 songs( even &quot;Williams tale&quot; which is Bassist Joey DeMaio proving that the bass can be a lead instrument too) are what set Manowar apart from the rest of the pack.From the song titled after the group &quot;Manowar&quot; to the Orson Welles narrated &quot; Dark Avenger&quot; and finally the title track, they took Heavy Metal to a new dimension.All the musicians in this band are great and play their own unique styles. But I was totally blown away by the vocal ability of singer Eric Adams. This is definitely an album that has stood the test of time. It is a must for any fan of Manowar, Heavy Metal/Hard Rock or people with good taste.I own every Manowar album and I would have to rate this in the top three(3)of all of their albums.
0553275569|2.0|I thought I would read this book after seeing a long reference to it in \\"Adventures in the Screenwriting Trade\\" by William Goldman. Goldman describes writing a screenplay of this book which was never used because of factors beyond his control. Goldman, who wrote Marathon Man and The Princess Bride, gives a synopsis of The Right Stuff that made me interested in reading the novel.<br />I had to put the book down after the first chapter. Wolfe's flippant style is grating. After each fatal crash he mockingly repeats his description of the trainees ritualistic behavoir in donning their bridge coats (their formal uniform) to attend the funeral.<br />The writer relates how worried the young pilots wives are, how they live in fear that their men are going to crash and burn. This is an unusual viewpoint to take in writing about heroic figures. It's as if someone sat down to write a book about Caesar or William the Conqueror written from the perspective of their worried wives...
B000003S0P|5.0|After the experimental and absurd &quot;Starless and Bible Back&quot;. Crimson had already created a new way to play progressive rock. Heavy guitar riffs, jazz-like drums and bass, all sort of percussions and the magnificent Mellotron and violin sound. The 72-74 line-up is fantastic ! In 74, they were about to end their works, but they just entered the studio and everything changed. Fripp and the band came with fresh new songs, of high quality rock ! &quot;Red&quot; is a great and typical progressive rock album of the 70s. David Cross appears as a guest this time, Mel Collins and Ian Mcdonald too. As a power trio, Crimson simply made one of the most intense rock records of all times ! The song &quot;Red&quot; opens the album with a powerful guitar riff, a loud bass and excelent drums. We can hear a Cello too. Excelent track, Crimson with all heaviness (as in Larkspart 2). &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; is a delightful song, very beautiful vocals by Wetton, plus a great guitar work. The second part of the song is a hard sax improvise. BEAUTIFUL. &quot;One More Red Nightmare&quot;, as &quot;Red&quot; has a heavy guitar, but there is a jazz-like part in the middle that is just brilliant ! &quot;Providence&quot; is like any other track from &quot;Starless and Bible Back&quot;, pure improvise. Starts with a nice and dark violin by Cross, and the members starts to enter as the song go on. At the end we have a powerful jazz trio just breaking all progressive rules ! YEAH ! &quot;Starless&quot; is the most beautiful track that Crimson made (probably). Really beautiful vocals, marvelous sax and guitars. Fripps guitar solo is a little bit bizarre, but the track is really intense ! Wetton best vocals on Crimson. Brufords drums is soft, gentle, but what a precision. At the end he explode in heavy rhythms ! &quot;Red&quot; is an essential album for progressive fans, much more accessible than the last one and a really nice record !
B00005LLK8|4.0|Billy Elliot is a wonderfully written movie.  The acting is above average, although not spectacular.  I was most pleased with the way the movie would have subplots that seemed not to fit with the movie (such as the miner's strike), but they would be wonderfully interwoven into the movie in a way that was thought provoking.<br />However, I was somewhat dissapointed with the movie's handling of the homosexual issue.  While the point of the movie was that not all boys that are interested in dance, etc. are homosexuals, the movie gives the impression that all male homosexuals are interested in dance, etc.-- which I don't think to be true.  However, that aside, the movie deals with the issue of young boys and their emotions very well.  It shows that there is nothing wrong with emotionally expressive boys.  I was also impressed with the way the writer handled the family situation- the interactions between Billy, his father, his brother, and his grandmother were intense and meaningful.<br />Overall, a movie worth seeing for anybody interested in child psychology.  Also a good discussion starter for families... teenage and above.<br />As a note, since this is a British film, the accents may take awhile to get used to (for Americans), but it is not very difficult to keep up.
B00005QDW1|4.0|Reading through these reviews, one can figure out who bought it and who didn't.  Those who complain of a repeating line (loop) with each track - downloaded it from the internet.  Some smartass created and distributed (quite successfully, I might add) throughout the P2P networks.<br />Serves them right, people just download and don't even think about what they got.  In any case, people should support the work of artists and at least buy some of their CD's... not just download them.  What a bunch of mindless leeches!<br />This is a good CD - but even without the &quot;loop&quot;, I'll admit there is a bit of a repetitive nature throughout the CD.  I sort of like their older stuff a bit more though.
0312932081|5.0|This book is one of the best i have ever read. It is also unlike anything i have ever read. It has the abliltiy to draw you in to the story and experience it almost first hand. Orson Scott Card's imagination and ability to create such vivid descriptions in his writing is amazing, he is truly one of the greatest writers in history. <BR>     Enders Game is a very harsh and brash book. It shows the journey of one child from being a sheepish little schoolboy that is tormented by his sadistic brother and pampered by his caring sister, to becoming a ruthless soldier that is focused on ridding the universe of the buggers (An insectoid alien race controled by a hive mind). Thi sbook will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. (would also make an excelent movie).
0061040967|5.0|This book is tailor made for Disc world aficionados.  The beautiful illustrations (particularly to DeQuirm series) are worth the price of the book alone and a wonderful story to go with it.  I would not recommend this to anyone who hasn't kept up with the series.  I am still laughing from the pseudo Latin motto of the &quot;brave heroes&quot;.<br />If you are a big fan, then grab a spoon and dig in, this was made for you!=
B00005QDW5|2.0|I agree with other reviewers, this two disk set is missing so many songs that I consider hits. In fact, only half the songs included in this set could be considered hits. I can't ever remember hitting the forward button on my cd player so often, to skip songs. Who decided all these songs were hits? Will a second anthology come out next Christmas with the rest of the hits? Only a true die-hard fan will enjoy all the songs on these two disks and they probably already have the original albums. Even though you won't hear the song on this set, I suggest that like Mr. Floyd, you hang up on this collection.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I was pretty shocked, listening to Roger Ebert's commentary, on how much special effects played a role in creating Citizen Kane.  Citizen Kane is as contrived as anything in Star Wars, states Ebert in a great feature length commentary that touches on just about everything from the revolutionary deep focus film techniques to amusing on-screen gaffs by some of the actors.  There is also a commentary by Welles biographer and director Peter Bogdanovich, which is similar to Ebert's although not quite as engaging and enthusiastic as the plump critics'.  Listening to Ebert is like sitting down in your favorite class with your favorite professor...I love the guy and his commentary is one of the reasons I bought the disc.<br />The actual movie looks beautiful.  The engineers did a great job in transferring the film to digital form and the picture is bright and brimming with detail.  And if you consider the fact that I use RCA cables rather than S-video let alone component video with progressive scan, it emphasizes how beautifully the film has been remastered.<br />The package also contains an extra disc with the 2-hour long documentary \\"The Battle over Citizen Kane.\\"  The program gives an in depth look at both Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst and how the controversy surrounding Citizen Kane was as epic, influential and far reaching as the film itself.  The discs also boast some interesting special features.  One section reveals some letters written to Welles documenting initial reaction to the film from fans and studio heads as well as some nice still shots of the Citizen Kane premier and the deleted brothel scene.<br />Besides the fact that the beautifully transferred movie is superior entertainment, the commentaries and documentary disc make it a superior educational experience as well.  I have a pretty large DVD collection of around 100 titles or so and I know quality when I see it.  Citizen Kane Special Edition delivers and no DVD collection should be without it!
B00005N9CV|1.0|Diana is a superior jazz pianist, in the classical mold.  She also has an engaging and flexible singing voice, and an easily recognizable yet not overly idiosynchratic style, both of which perfectly match her piano technique and stylings.  Her &quot;When I Look in Your Eyes&quot; works on a personal level as well as anything I've heard, ever; there is a lightness, intelligence, competence, and humor to it that just makes you sit back and enjoy.<br />So what is she doing here with that latin beat drum machine?  And 1000 strings recorded someplace where she obviously wasn't?  And song stylizings that sounded like they were &quot;developed&quot; by a focus group of old Mantovani fans (no offense)?  Where was her piano?  Let me re-state that this way: WHERE IN THE NAME OF THE ROMAN GODDESS DIANA WAS HER PIANO?  <br />Is this what she wants to do next?  Or are we hearing what happens when a recording studio does demographic studies of the Leisure World crowd (no offense)?  Well, I'm old enough to be in that crowd, and I'm going to tell you this:  FORGET IT!  PLEASE!!!
B000001E7L|5.0|If you've just suffered a break-up, this is great to listen to at night, curled up in bed, with all the lights off!  It'll make you cry, then cheer you up.  All the songs are about love, loss, and hope.  It's the Cranberries most popular cd, having the hit single &quot;Zombie&quot;, which most people have heard.  &quot;Ode To My Family&quot; is just that.  &quot;Ridiculous Thoughts&quot; and &quot;I Can't Be With You&quot; are rockers about breaking up, missing a loved one.  Every song is guaranteed to pull at your heartstrings.  It's all emotional stuff, no matter if it's hard or soft.  &quot;Dreaming My Dreams&quot; is a hopeful ballad for true love.  &quot;Daffodil Lament&quot; goes from moody to hopeful.  Only a stony hearted person couldn't be effected by it.  If you've never bought anything by the Cranberries, this is a perfect start.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Throughout the decades many songs have come and gone, and many artists experience being a one hit wonder. This is no the situation, however, in the case of Pink. In her newly released album, Missundaztood, Pink clearly tries to emphasize her distinction from other artists and the pop icons--Britney Spears--of today with her cleverly written songs, unique display of music and beat, and new, &quot;not such a bad girl after all,&quot; portrayal. Her album explores diverse songs and topics. The song reflect her personality, and lots of time and emotion that went into the album. I surpassingly acclaim PInk for her individualism and superb album.
B000002KXV|5.0|When I first heard Steely Dan's Fagen &amp; Becker, it was on a nightly Jazz program called &quot;After Hours&quot;, on CBC. They were being interviewed by the host, Ross Porter, in a Starbucks in Vancouver B.C. Canada.  They where haveing a great time talking about Jazz and their new album, &quot;Two against Nature&quot; Donald's voice was very different on the songs then in the interview.  However, after going to a music shop the next day and listening to their new album and their old stuff, I concluded that these guys are Jazz buffs and didnt cookie-cut their material.  It was a year after I picked up 2vsNature that I came across a album that is a mainstay next to my collection of Miles, Hancock, Peterson, Corea... Donald Fagen's &quot;The NightFly&quot; is a diamond in the ruff.  Unfortunatley only eight tracks but each one is a masterpiece of Smooth Jazz/Pop/Blues/Ballad(3/4)/Soul... it covers a lot of ground musically speaking and Donalds abstract lyrics are the perfect fit to these interesting songs.  My Favorite is the title cut &quot;The Nightfly&quot; its kind of funny and sad at the same time and the chord progressions leave you wondering &quot;was that a A#5b9 or a A13#11&quot; The bottom line is Donald knows his stuff and the a great cast of session players on this album as well as Donald playing the synth/rhodes/hammond <BR>makes for a smooth studio finish.  Even the vocal arrangement on &quot;Maxime&quot; rivals 'Take6'. It's great Fagen&amp;Becker won 4 grammys in 2001, because they are sure deserved it escpecially Donald who I personally think dosent even need Walter Becker, he's a genius on his own. The only thing that &quot;The Nightfly&quot; lacks is more tracks.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears' new album, Britney, is great!! I never used to like Britney Spears, but after listening to this CD, she is now one of my favorite artists! The songs on this album are all really good, and have truth to them. (not like the rest of the popular mainstream music that is all empty words and no feelings) I love every song on this CD, they each have incredible background music and a really cool beat. Congratulations, Britney- you're doing a great job!
B00003CXTG|1.0|I remember actually liking Top Gun until the carrier's catapult was stuck (uh, there are three of them), which was a problem as they were being attacked by Soviet client state F-5's (made in the U.S.) with Exocet missiles (French).  I don't know what happened after that, because I walked out.<br />I never got past the trailer with this turkey, as the incredibly fake scene of pyrotechnics going off between decidely post WWII reserve frigates put me off before I ever got near the theatre. Did they run out of special effects budget?  Gag me.  <br />Nobody bothers to get naval stuff right it seems.  What, you thought the German navy had destoyers with multiple twin gun turrets (U-571)?  That WWII U.S. carriers had angled flight decks (Midway)?  I guess my favorite of all time is the U.S. gun cruiser Salem standing in for the Graf Spee, hee hee (Battle of River Platte). I guess I'll never know what other similar horrors await in Pearl Harbor.
B00005RFAI|5.0|\\"Missundaztood\\" may have meant that if you heard her debut album, you'd have no idea how good P!nk can really be. Clearly given more control to be herself this time around, P!nk takes hold and showcases her strong voice with emotion and passion that somehow escapes the Britney clones. And, since P!nk calls this her \\"real\\" album, who can argue?<br />Give her credit, she stands toe to toe with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler and Four Non-Blonde's Linda Perry on duets and comes off sounding every bit as good. The writing, while minimalist and hook laden, holds extraordinary depth. Especially on tracks such as \\"Family Portrait\\" and \\"Dear Diary.\\"<br />I haven't stopped listening to this CD for a week. Which for me is amazing. Especially when you consider I barely made it through her first CD once.
B00005QDW1|4.0|Awesome! A must have for any music fan. The songs are fresh and well developed. I can honestly say that all the songs on this CD are good and worth listening to. Worth the $.
6303471714|5.0|Joan, relax already.  I've never read such a scathing review.  Of course, as with all work-out routines, the participants need to be aware of posture, breathing, and their own limitations.  Cindy reminds us of that in the beginning of the tape.  I have lost 15 pounds and toned up significantly since starting this work-out 5 months ago.  I personally recommend it to anyone who is slightly to moderately overweight, and are already familiar with working out.  Just take it at your own pace, that's the key.  I had a lower back problem prior to doing this work-out and my back has yet to go out on me.  I'm still discovering new muscles I never knew I had!  It's so cool!
B00005U2LM|5.0|This is the Wu's best album since 36 Chambers.  The beats and rhymes are off the hook.  You can tell that the Wu is sick of being underrated.  Rza also experimented by allowing other producers to shine.  Mathematics dropped an amazing beat  it in &quot;Rules.&quot;  &quot;Uzi&quot; and &quot;Ya'll been warned&quot; are instant hits.  &quot;Iron Flag&quot; is a Wu-banger right up there with &quot;Triumph&quot; and &quot;Protect ya neck.&quot;  Trust me, the Wu went all out for this album.  12 tracks of pure genius.
0452282152|4.0|As has been noted by other reviewers, this is not a book that is going to be well-loved by scholars of Vermeer.  It is purely a fictional tale.  But it is a quite delightful fictional tale that I found to be a very pleasant and quite interesting read.  It is the story of an impoverished girl who is sent to be a lowly maid in the Vermeer household in the mid 1600s.  Her interaction with the master, whilst quite innocent, is a catalyst for suspicion and jealousy amongst other members of the household, both above and below stairs.  Much of her time is spent treading carefully as rumours of her relationship with Vermeer spread throughout the house and the entire town.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I am sure others will too so long as they don't try to make it into anything more serious.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Have had this DVD for a wee while now - it was released in New Zealand on the 5th of December and all I can say is WOW!  This is why we have DVD players - even if you didn't enjoy this movie you could not help but appreciate the ingenious extras that this double disc set has to offer.  I personally ADORE this movie, however after talking to a multitude of people it seems to be a movie you either Love or Hate with no ground in between - and isn't that what great movies are about to produce passion and not a wimpy - &quot;can't decide if I like it&quot; mentality?  Anyway on to the stars, Ewan and Nicole, again WOW!  Who knew these two had voices like that, and as for John L ! Well what can you say except exceptional....  The imagery in this film is so wonderfully stylistic it makes you want to escape to Paris and the Moulin Rouge - go out and buy this movie and make yourself a very happy person...
B000002UUX|5.0|This is by far Megadeth's best cd to date. It features Marty Friedman on lead guitar and you can tell. Awesome guitar solos!! This was the cd in which Megadeths sound was mastered and all Megadeth cd's should be compared. Dave and Marty swap solos and establish themselves as the best guitar duo of 1990. <BR> From beginning to end this cd is nonstop Metal madness. From the political songs Holy Wars and Rust In Peace to the tale of betrayed love Tornado Of Souls you will bang your head until it hurts...then play it again. The guitar work on Five Magics is unbelievable and clean, as is the whole cd.<BR> Killing Is My Business, Peace Sells &amp; So Far, So Good...So What! were nowhere near as intense and complicated as this cd, even though some tracks may have been faster. If you haven't heard this cd, you ain't heard Metal. If you like a guitar solos and complicated riffs, this cd is for you. Of this time period, the only cd's comparable to this would be ...And Justice For All (Metallica) or Piece of Mind (Iron Maiden), neither of which is better!
B000000WHC|4.0|I liked gary moore before the whole blues thing, but I always thought he would make a really good blues man. While this is not traditional blues like Albert King Or Muddy Waters, or even BB king, It is a nice addition to the Rock/Blues category.<BR>Oh prety woman is a good tune and as a whole album I would say it is a success.If you like stuff like Walter Trout,Coco Montoya,<BR>Bill Perry,or Blue Max , you'll like this.
B00000IQW3|4.0|I was a teenager when this came out, and went to see it a few times, liking it more than I thought it deserved. Now that I can see a bit more clearly, it's obvious that this is because it's one of the best-finished and satisfying movies of the time, with a great cast, and all the right attitude. It is always going to be obscure, because it's not Cool enough. I think it has roughly the same audience as &quot;Logan's Run&quot;. Plenty of people know what is good.
B000002BYD|4.0|When I listen to my PJ albums, Yield always leaves me a tad bit unfulfilled.  This isn't No Code, but it's a really good album in its own right with some well-known stellar songs (&quot;Wishlist&quot;, &quot;Do The Evolution&quot;) and some unknown even-better songs (&quot;Pilate&quot;, the poetically weird &quot;Push Me, Pull Me&quot;).  However, when I hit the end I'm left a bit wanting; the disc seems short and could really use another song or two to fill it out.  If you're a PJ fan and you don't have this, pick it up by all means; if you're just starting out, you'd prolly be better off getting No Code and Ten/Vs, great examples of the band's current depth and incredible rocking roots.
0767802659|5.0|The director doesn't need to justify this film as he attempts to do in the commentary; it should be self-evident what he's getting at. I can see why he spends so long on the politics, because if you were a little behind on your history, it might all look new to you!<br />The DVD transfer is simply the best I've got, with the football match scene in particular beautifully coloured and detailed. (This one I have on Region 2).<br />This was the best sci-fi to come along in years, with a brilliant adaptation of a 50's sci-fi plot to the screen. I am deeply indebted to these guys for doing this. When are they going to surprise us all again?
B000002BFZ|5.0|I was a big Pearl Jam fan when grunge ruled the earth, picking up Ten and Vs, but they lost me with Vitalogy.  I tuned out, never bought the disc, and was oblivious to Pearl Jam until my friend turned me back on last summer.  I remember shrugging off No Code when it came out, but I can say now that this album is phenomenal, easily Pearl Jam's best.  The album is one hell of a tease: it starts of slow, kicks into high gear on the second track, and proceeds to mess with you until it reaches the very end.  Along the way you'll witness some amazing songs: the crunchy Smile, heartfelt Off He Goes, greatly-drummed In My Tree and punky Mankind, among others.  This album isn't as drastic a departure as other reviewers would have you believe; if you like their previous stuff chances are No Code will easily coax you into the PJ of today.  You just need to give it a chance.  A masterpiece.
B00000099Y|5.0|aenima, although many of you will disagree, is tools best album. i dont necissarily see how that is so hard to believe, but for some of you it is a problem. first off aenima has pretty much all of the best songs tool has written, besides prison sex. eulogy, 46 and 2, hooker with a penis, push it, aenima, H, and stinkfist...hopefully i didnt miss any. there are of course many other very good tool songs, but a cd with as many extremely good ones is a rarity. but aenima fortunately fits into that rarity. i am getting tired of tool fans looking at their other cds stating they are better when it is as clear as it can get the aenima is heads above the rest. i would also like to state that maynard james keenan is an excellent song writer and has the best voice in rock music. but as a side note to some listeners, maynard is about as closeminded as it gets. he speaks for open mindedness and tells others to do the same. and he uses lyric that should and will offend most people. he also preaches that he is right and that you are wrong. which in and of itself speaks out against his own views. so in conclusion, listen to the music as it is, pretty much take it at face value because that is all the deeper the lyrics get. he comes across as (an angry) punk who sits around and questions everyone because he himself doesnt know what to think. not a person to follow because he is going nowhere, but the music is some of the greatest and most original since led zeppelin.

B00003CXTF|4.0|I've read the reviews on here..I don't think this movie deserves that much criticism.  I have found that this movie is very easy to get into, no disappointment here.  It's fairly long, three hours to be exact, but it's worth the watch.  There's great acting, a beautiful love story, and you get a general idea on what it was like to be out to war during that time.  I thought the movie did a great job..and everything was tied together nicely at the end.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I first saw this movie in 1987 for the fiftieth anniversary....back then I thought Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a really boring story.<BR>After viewing this movie on DVD, I realize how wrong I was. It is a beautiful movie. I love the way that it was completely restored. I actually cried when Snow White died.<br />My favorite part of the DVD is the Dopey's Mine Game. It was so much fun to gather all of the seven dwarfs in the mine!
B00003CXTG|1.0|I watched sporadically the predictable love story<BR>portion of the film - waiting for the inevitable attack<BR>sequence. I am fortunate to live with a survivor of the<BR>attack who is now 90 years of age. He was frustrated by <BR>the way Hollywood has to always distort history and dumb down<BR>a film. This is a shame since younger Americans will view<BR>this film as a historical piece rather than a very inaccurate<BR>recounting of a very important event.
B00003CXIP|5.0|I am 27 yrs old and watched this in my teens and it is still one of my favorites. Many people complain of the amount of profanity but as a child their age I used that same profanity and if you look at your own childhood you will realize how much a potty mouth we all had. since this movie was created in the 80's its market was for people alive today. So if your concerned about wether the amount of profanity was used in the time period isn't relevent its about your childhood. Place yourself in thier shoes and put your childhood friends faces on them and live it. Its touching to see the ending and it makes you miss your friends of yesteryear. I hope you enjoy the movie. If your open minded and love a truelife like story then you will enjoy it over and over again. If your looking for a happy ending dont get this movie you will be disapointed.
B00005U2LM|3.0|This was a fairly weak performance for a group as strong as the wu-tang clan. Still worth buying though.
B00005NMXI|4.0|A great way to buy a Townes Van Zandt collection. This is wonderful..his 7 studio albums from 1969 to 1978, plus 8 live songs from 1973, plus you get a wonderful book with full bio.<BR>Early Townes in entirity....a must have.....beautiful !<BR>They don't come much better packaged than this.
B00005QG9J|5.0|A friend of mine introduced me to this band a few years ago.  I immediately fell in love after hearing S.C.I.E.N.C.E. They were not a real popular band in my school until the hit &quot;Drive&quot;.  Highly anticipating  the release of &quot;Morning View&quot;  my father found a version online that we could download.  The cd went on continuous play for days!! I love it!! When the cd hit stores I had to buy a copy too.  This is a great record and I am so proud of the boys.  Brandon Boyd has the gift to reach out and grab a person's stomach!! He really can make a person think.  &quot;Warning&quot; is a phenomenal song that truly expresses why people should throw caution to the end and do what they want! This band has brought many insights on many subjects and the new cd is even better!Aquaious Transmission shows a playful, adventerous, and fun side of the band.  I can't get enough of this cd.  Words can not  express the feelings of this record!
B000001GQQ|3.0|Without reservation this is a fine recording; Michelangeli's is an act of God.  A crude analogy would be as follows: the girl next door is pretty; the girl of one's dreams is the stuff of life.  I urge you to not buy this recording! Buy the michelangeli recording on emi.
B00005QDW1|2.0|Okay-what's with No Doubt?This album shows their yearn for pop domination.Britney Spears and all the other anorexic princesses get old.Most fans want the ska influenced kids from Orange County,not the same old rap and dance music.This album shows their drastic change from ska/rock to the same old stuff.Come on guys-it's time to grow up a little.
B00005U2LM|5.0|This is a masterpiece album for diehard wu fans. If you arent a wu fan and are into that commercial non sense this may not be the album for you. The album blends in some amazing beats like in &quot;Rules&quot;, &quot;Uzi&quot;, &quot;In the HooD&quot;, My favorite track on the album is the end of IRON FLAG where the WU display their anthem like Capone and Noreaga's on their first classic album. Rza's lyrics and blasting wu sound blister throughout the album. Inspekda deck shines supreme on this album with his story telling. This is the album for you if you like real quality hip hop not that pop music like JZ. Jz was much better before he was a sell out!
B00005QZ7U|2.0|I dont no this movie was ok. I was confused half the time and it was really werid.  They did a good job singing.  I should probably see this movie once again maybe i would understand it better.
B000005S0D|5.0|While the preceding Camel album, &quot;A Single Factor&quot;, was a blatant attempt to produce a hit single, Stationary Traveller attempted to squeeze out that last battle cry for progressive rock while embracing the trends of 1984, and was a miraculous artistic success.  The loose concept is held together about as tightly as  conceivable, every song or instrumental leading brilliantly into the next, all at least good, and the sum far exceeding the parts.  It is here that guitarist Latimer assumes the mantle of leadership unchallenged, thanks to keening guitar solos that seem to awe in their own stark beauty.  Judicious use of Alan Parsons' alumnus Chris Rainbow adds to the accessibility of the recording.  From start to finish, this is a masterpiece.  If possible, seek out the live video &quot;Pressure Points&quot; which features strong renditions of every song on this CD along with prior Camel classics.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I am a longtime fan of Pixar, but found &quot;Antz&quot; from Dreamworks to be hard to look at and tedious to sit through.  As a result, I stayed away from Shrek in the theaters.  I finally bought the DVD -- mostly for my daughter -- and was surprised to find a great animated film.  &quot;Witty&quot; and &quot;warm&quot; are two cliches that deserved to be trotted out here; &quot;Shrek&quot; is clever without pretension, sharp without being mean, and warm without being sappy.  Like Disney's &quot;Emporer's New Groove&quot;, &quot;Shrek&quot; abandons the sentimental mush and goes for a smart retake on the traditional, Disney-esque school. <BR>   <BR>&quot;Shrek&quot; outdoes &quot;Groove&quot;, though, in its astonishing computer animation.  Toys and bugs have been the subject of CGI animation because, until recently, the systems could not reliable handle skin and other organic materials.  No longer.  &quot;Shrek&quot; sets the bar very high for the computer generated film; the animation here is on par with the work being done by Lucasfilm for the new &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies.  Shrek the Ogre, however, is much more likable than Jar-Jar Binks.  Seriously, from fields of waving grass to balls of dragonfire -- not to mention the winning characters -- the animation of &quot;Shrek &quot;is nothing less than amazing.<br />Finally, &quot;Shrek&quot; would be cold and lackluster without the human voices that inform the characters.  Michael Myers voices the ogre with a heart of gold using his familiar Scottish accent.  However, it is turned way down from the caricature levels used in &quot;So I Married An Axe Murderer&quot; and &quot;Austin Powers 2.&quot;  Eddie Murphy plays Donkey, a sidekick voiced in a suspicously similar fashion to his dragon Mu-Shu in &quot;Mulan.&quot;  That quibble aside, I should say that Donkey is the most perfect marriage of voice and character design I've ever seen in an animated film.  Carmen Diaz does a lot with what might have been a little as Princess Fiona, and John Lithgow is suitably honey-voiced as the despicable Lord Farquad.<br />If you aren't interested in the quality of the animation or the dynamics of the voice performances, you'll probably be won over by the satire.  Farquad's kingdom Duloc is, in a bit of inspired lunacy, envisioned as a wicked satire of Disneyland, from the huge parking lots (YOU ARE PARKED IN LANCELOT, reads a sign) to a hilarious parody of the Disneyland staple, 'It's A Small World.'  Dreamwork's co-founded Jeffrey Katzenberg must have loved it.<br />The DVD is a winner, coming on two disks stuffed with bonus features -- commentaries, deleted scenes, storyboard pitches, making-of documentaries and, maybe best of all, a precious two minutes of &quot;Shrek's Karaoke Music Swamp.&quot;  <br />&quot;Shrek&quot; is funny, smart and fabulous, and deserves to be on the shelf of nearly any DVD collector.
B000002BVN|5.0|The five new songs are good.  The standout tracks are Blood on the Dance Floor, Morphine, Ghosts and Is It Scary.  The remixes are new listening experience in Michael's music.  Before releasing another album in the 21st century, Michael chose to release a few new songs and remixes from the HIStory album, a masterpiece of music, in my viewpoint.
0385505833|2.0|Just a short note. If you have read Grisham's novels and have been hooked by the story lines but distracted by the virulently racist characters you'll appreciate this warning.<br />Don't get cozy with the Kranks.<br />The reader is informed, halfway through the book, that the Kranks don't want their daughter to marry a man with dark skin. Its impossible to care about what happens to these two from then on.<br />Skip Skipping Christmas. Or stop reading at page 112 and dream up your own ending. Its a fun book up to chapter 13.
0441172717|3.0|This book is good enough for someone to read if they aren't busy, and are almost bored out of their minds, and if they don't stop reading this book, they will end up finishing it without a problem.  The only problem that I have with this book are with the rest of the series, which seems to be milking his worlds for all that they are worth, and in retrospect, I realize that I have read books that are a lot better.<br />If you like politics, this book would seem a lot better to you.  I can understand the politics, but it doesn't seem to really interest me all that much.  I also like fantasy books more than science fiction, and I would rather have the main character that seems all-powerful to have some more impressing abilites than to simply see into the future, and then to find out that he isn't the only one that can do that in the universe made it almost like he wasn't THAT special, and was simply the right person in the right place at the right time.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|For the most part, this album lives up to the hype.  The combination of Eddie's guitar wizardry wedded to a potent brew of hard rock songwriting is still unsurpassed and without equal.  Prior to this album, no one played guitar this ferociously with such crispness.  80's pop metal - well exemplified by songs such as Guns 'N Roses &quot;Sweet Child O'mine&quot;, - was obviously influenced by this album's emphasis upon solid Zeppelin-esque riffs, and melodic use of highly defined harmonics, fret-tapping of insane speed and clarity, and utter mastery of whammy-bar fret melting.<br />Check out the sustain of the blues chords on &quot;Runnin' With The Devil&quot;, and the Thump-thump-Th-Thump-thump of the bass.  The title of &quot;Eruption&quot; speaks for itself.  Wolfgang Amadeus would approve.  &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, sounds like the Kinks on steroids.  &quot;Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love&quot;, features the album's catchiest riff.  Ed's amp swarms with overdrive as the song ends.  On &quot;I'm The One&quot;, Dave implores all the hot groupies to give it up and &quot;show your love&quot;.  On &quot;Jamie's Cryin'&quot;, the band explains that Jamie needs more than &quot;one night stands&quot;, so she never calls the guy she likes  because &quot;she knows what that'll get her&quot;; Another catchy tune.<br />Ed rubs his palm across his strings, over his pickup to get the crunchy opening to &quot;Atomic Punk&quot; - &quot;Nobody rules these streets at night but me&quot;.  &quot;Feel Your Love Tonight&quot;, is poppy with nice backing vocals.  &quot;Little Dreamer&quot;, demonstrates how just a simple blues lick, can produce a great classic rock sound.  As on &quot;Could This Be Magic?&quot;, and &quot;Big Bad Bill(Is Sweet William Now)&quot;, from later albums, DLR gives his impressive interpretation of an old time southern blues style song on &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot;.  Ed adds a razor sharp, liquid guitar-solo overload.  The aptly titled, &quot;On Fire&quot;, seethes with energy and bombast.  The power chords and solo burn with an out of control fury.  Dave has the ultimate howl-of-the-wild voice.  The songwriting is at times immature, but nevertheless, VH1 is arguably the most seminal album of the past quarter century.hes with energy and bombast.

B0000027D5|1.0|This two-disc set could be condensed to a single disc and still have room left over if they removed the self-indulgent, seemingly endless transitions and other long, non-melodic stretches.<BR>What's great about Santana is his ability to speak melodically with his guitar; unfortunately, this CD just doesn't get the job done. Parts of it sound like he's practicing, not performing.<BR>If you like songs, try Moonflower or one of the early studio albums. Even true devotees would have to admit this set pretty far from melodic, although it has about three spots where it becomes recognizable (such as Black Magic Woman on disc one).<BR>And what's up with that long drum solo on disc 2? He's got several great people playing rhythm but instead we get a rather conventional, '60s-style drum solo.<br />I love Moonflower; I just can't connect with Lotus.

B00005QDW5|3.0|Oh no! Not another 'best of' compilation. I already got all their albums, re-issues and other compilations. I also got hold of some of their unofficial live releases but the sound quality is pretty bad in most cases. I wish they would release more of their live performances instead, like &quot;Is There Anybody Out There?&quot;, specially their older live stuff. I think every floyd fan would like to see and hear that.<BR>I've been a big fan of Pink Floyd ever since I first heard their music. I like all their older stuff specially. This is a great CD but not a true 'best of' in my humble opinion. There are so many other tracks that are ommitted, like &quot;Careful with that axe, eugene&quot;, &quot;Green is the colour&quot;, &quot;Cymbaline&quot; which they played almost all their earlier concerts, &quot;fat old sun&quot;, &quot;If&quot;, &quot;Let there be more light&quot;, &quot;Cirrus Minor&quot;, &quot;pillow of winds&quot; and so on.<BR>So, come on Pink Floyd, give us some old unreleased live stuff.
B00005O892|4.0|Pearl Harbor is a movie (DVD) that really takes the audience back to another era.  After reading many letters and accounts of this time period, I feel that the director and producer did an admirable job in transporting the viewer back in time.  People think that the love story is trite.  Well, they haven't read much about the &quot;lovers&quot; of this era.  Times were very different, and I think that the movie is very representative of the forties.  Also, the special effects only enhance the war scenes. After visiting P.H. three times, I can truly say that a movie that used so many effects and actual war heroes to portray a momentous day in American history deserves our attention.  Three cheers!
6302732875|5.0|Quite simply, the best sales movie ever made.  I know this is a tall statement, taking into consideration,  Death of A Salesman.  Excellent performances put in by an all-star cast of who's who in Hollywood.  If you haven't had the pleasure to see this hard hitting &quot;in your face&quot; movie,  I suggest you let the kids moan about going the extra walking distance to the video store in the local mall,  and buy it immediately.  You won't be disappointed.
0385505833|5.0|Mr. Grisham, who is a native of Starkville, Mississippi,(home of Miss. State U.)has made many Mission trips to various parts of Brazil and nearby countries.  He lived for some years in an area easily accessable to the to D.C. area.  I believe he knows very well the prejudices of so many of our(USA) people, from Christmas house-top decorations to skin color.  I laughed through four or five readings of his portrait of our love of ostentatious display, of how we ostracize one in our midst who is &quot;different&quot;, and of how most of us are basically kind people.<br />I have given copies to friends both young and old.  Now I am the one who thought the entire family was to be gone until after Christmas. A telephone call has given me two days to get ready for the first arrivals.

0440133688|5.0|There are all kinds of things I hate about this book.  I hate remembering how long I would go without sleep and the psychic torture that an internship inflicts on you.  I hated the depersonalization of patients.  I hated the sexual escapades.  Most of all, I hated having in print the real feelings of an intern who has been up for three days - praying on the way to the ER that that Nursing Home Gomer with 20 fatal diagnoses would have the decency to croak before you got there so you could get an extra five minutes of sleep or a stale doughnut before the cafeteria closed again.<br />Shem portrays masterfully the jumble of emotions of a typical intern.  There is a superficial level of glossy brown-nosing that got you into med school in the first place.  Buzz words like compassion, continuity of care and empathy are used with the teaching physicians and in meetings.  Then there is a deeper level of survival where you would kill your mother for 5 minutes of sleep or being able to crap without the code blue pager going off.  This level is usually not discussed or written about in many of the typical intern coming-of-age books out there.  Not because it isn't true, but because it's uncomfortable and offensive to non-physicians.  Shem is the master of this level of medical thinking.  No one else even comes close.  Shem approaches but doesn't quite get to an even more primal level - that of duty.  This level is what keeps an intern from punching his residency directors or the arrogant surgeon who asks him &quot;What is the difference between a sh*thead and a brown-noser&quot; and then tells you the answer is depth perception.(True story)  It's what makes you do your best when you know the patient is hopeless or even abusive as you try your best to save them from themselves or some disease.<br />The humor is black as night and the sex is soft-core porn, according to my nephew in medical school to whom I sent a copy of this book.<br />House of God has two profound themes.  The first is a detailed description of medicine and medical training.  This theme is presented with black humor, and some (but not as much as you think) exaggeration.  I have read nothing that does this better.  The second theme of the book is universal, however.  It is the theme of Man vs. World and the World wins, but the Man is too maimed to know it.<br />The book still disturbs and haunts me because Shem puts in print graphically and eloquently some of the thoughts and occurences that we don't even admit to ourselves.he first is a detailed description of medicine and medical training.

B000002J2F|3.0|On one hand, Duke features lots of upbeat, catchy, hook-laden songs. It even boasts two radio staples: &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; and &quot;Turn It On Again.&quot;<br />Yet, this isn't the Genesis I knew and loved. And I have a very hard time getting into this Pop Radio band that still flies the Genesis banner.<br />Interestingly, &quot;Duchess&quot; contains rhythm and drum sounds that were to become ubiquitous with Genesis and Phil Collins songs for the next 10 years. It's interesting here in its infancy. But that sound quickly began to rub me the wrong way the more I heard it.<br />My favorite tracks include the aforementioned &quot;Duchess,&quot; &quot;Man Of Our Times,&quot; &quot;Duke's Travels&quot; and -- God help me -- &quot;Turn It On Again,&quot; although that's about as far from the Genesis of old as any song could get.<br />I think Duke falls somewhere between the old Genesis and the new Genesis. Consequently, it's liable to be overlooked by the fans of the Phil Collins-era band...and despised by the fans of the Peter Gabriel-era band. In other words, Duke as likely as not falls through the cracks. <br />Now, I can't say for sure if that's good or bad. Overall, there's not much on Duke that I can listen to repeatedly, so I'm inclined to think it's not a bad thing Duke is often overlooked.<br />Cool album graphics, though.
B000002WYT|5.0|This has got to be one of the greatest CD's of the past 10 years.  I have listened to it countless times and it never gets old for me.  It is not just a musical recording, it is a journey of the most magical proportions.  I can't name one song as a favorite on this album, but ones that stand out the most to me are as follows;<br />~ Two Step:  This is a masterpiece, plain and simple.  I guess you have to hear it live to understand the true brilliance behind it, but you can get a good idea from this recording.<br />~ Crash Into Me:  One of the greatest sensual songs ever written.  Artfully orchistrated and executed...its just magic.  A great song to make love to!<br />~ Lie in our Graves:  Evokes a wide range of emotions with its ebb and flow.  It starts off with a driving guitar lick and then settles down into a soft groove and then brings it back up into a powerful piece of musical greatness.<br />~  Tripping Billies:  This song is pure fun.  I love dancing to this song because it reminds me of being young and carefree again.<br />~  #41 into Say Goodbye:  This is probably my favorite part of the album, when '#41' transitions into 'Say Goodbye.'  This is art in its finest form.  Words can't express it, you just have to hear it for youself. <br />I have all of DMB's albums, but this is my favorite because it has the perfect mix of instrumentals and catchy hooks and beautiful lyrics.  A previous post stated that DMB is not real music compared to Nirvana, Collective Soul and Green Day.  That is a sin in my eyes to say such words.  DMB is one of the bands saving music as it is today.  Get this CD as soon as possible...you won't be disapointed.
B000002J2D|3.0|As other reviewers have noted, this album represented a re-birth of sorts for Genesis, now reduced to three of its members.<br />With any other band, that would have been the death blow. Yet, for a band with this much talent still remaining (Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford are brilliant musicians), it only meant its members had to work even harder to fill the gaps.<br />And work they did.<br />And Then There Were Three... contains some interesting songs, probably among the last of their lengthier, more complicated compositions -- although the longest song on this album is &quot;Burning Rope,&quot; which clocks in at 7:07. (It's worth noting that this album contains 11 tracks when most other Genesis albums contained just 7 or 8.)<br />&quot;Down and Out&quot; kicks it off with a bang. A truly great track that makes its follow up (&quot;Undertow&quot;) sound that much less fulfilling. Still, Phil's voice hasn't yet taken on that screaming, overbearing quality it assumed on future albums (especially his solo material). So &quot;Undertow&quot; remains exactly what it is: a pleasant, if uneventful tune.<br />Other stand-out tracks include &quot;Burning Rope,&quot; &quot;Deep In the Motherload&quot; (my favorite track on the album) and &quot;Scenes From a Night's Dream&quot; -- all among their more upbeat, driving songs on the album. Obviously, I'm not a big fan of Phil Collins' voice. Nor can I warm up to the unbelievably syrupy &quot;Follow You Follow Me.&quot;<br />And Then There Were Three... is an interesting album that still features remnants of the Genesis style I grew to love and respect. It's the last of its kind, however. Duke would begin to show the world just how far Genesis -- and Phil Collins -- would go to strike commercial riches.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen has been considered a classic for many years and now that I've read it I definitely agree with its status.  I read this book for a school project and did not expect much when I began reading.  It was very difficult for me to get into the language and understand what was going on in the plot.  I considered the book a bore until I was more than half way done reading it.  I'm not sure at which point this transformation took place but I found myself completely engrossed in the characters and the plot.  I wanted so badly for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to get together!  I absolutely could not stop reading until I was done with the last page of the last chapter.  Once I had finished I just sat there for a few minutes, reflecting on my experience with this book.  My advice to readers who are struggling with the language is to keep reading!  The challenge is part of the success you will feel when you finish the book.  Jane Austen writes with beautiful imagery and has wonderful diction.  This love story will touch you to the core.  I am convinced that I will read Pride and Prejudice again, and in the second reading I will enjoy the first half of the book much more.  I would say the ideal age to read this is college or older, at the youngest I would say a senior in high school.  I urge you to read Pride and Prejudice and to let yourself appreciate Jane Austen's brilliant writing technique.
B000002J29|5.0|Seconds Out is one of the most amazing live albums I've ever heard. And this &quot;Definitive Edition Remaster&quot; edition makes it even better. <br />This album is, in all respects, perfect. It's equal cannot be found anywhere. Musically, these guys are at the top of their craft. (Particularly with the addition of drummers Chester Thompson and King Crimson/Yes beatmaster Bill Bruford.) Lyrically, this album -- although it borrows heavily from Trick of the Tail -- runs the gamut, going back all the way to &quot;The Musical Box&quot; from Nursery Cryme. <br />And, glory be!, it features the entire 25-minute epic &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; from Foxtrot. This version, even though Phil Collins is singing it instead of Peter Gabriel, is dramatic, powerful and guaranteed to give you goosebumps.<br />Speaking of Phil Collins, this live album sounds so much like Peter Gabriel in parts that you'd swear he was still in the band.<br />So, the good news is this 1977-released 2-CD set is a perfect representation of Genesis at their peak. The recording is flawless. The song selection is impeccable.<br />Now for the bad news...<br />This was the last great Genesis album. Shortly after its release, guitarist Steve Hackett left the band, bringing the members of Genesis down to three (hence, the title of their next studio release: And Then There Were Three...). Genesis would never recover from the loss, and would slide inexorably closer to Top 40 Hell with each subsequent release.<br />If you want a very good representation of what Genesis used to sound like before everyone left and Phil Collins took over, Seconds Out would be a very, very good place to start.
0525946284|4.0|I just finished reading this new Ken Follet, and I am not really sure what to say. I really liked it, I liked the idea of an all female resistance team, but something just missed the mark. The action was great, and kept my interest, but I really started out liking it more than I did when I finished it.In other words, great lead in, not enough follow up. I felt like Mr. Follet skimped on character details or something, I just never felt really invested in the characters, just invested in their mission. I gave if 4 star instead of 3, just because it is Ken Follet, and if you are an espionage fan, you should read this. However, I don't think it is his best.
B000009FJL|3.0|Tresspass, released in 1970, was finally given the &quot;Definitive Edition Remaster&quot; CD treatment in 1994, although you'd be hard-pressed to find it anywhere. (I had to order mine through Amazon.) Unfortunate, since I can't think of another Genesis album that so sorely needed remastering. The flat production found on Trespass makes it, in my opinion, one of their least listenable. And the six relatively simplistic songs (by comparison to their later work) just don't hold my attention.<br />Ahh, but then you have to take into account The Peter Gabriel Factor. He's fascinating to listen to anytime, anywhere. And this -- Genesis' second album -- features his voice throughout, although sometimes a tad buried in the mix. Witness &quot;Stagnation,&quot; for example (an apt title if I've ever heard one). Interestingly, strains of &quot;Stagnation&quot; will be heard on Marillion albums a decade later, and even Genesis will borrow from their own material to repeat the keyboard/flute line that begins 6:57 into the song on later albums. <br />Pre-Phil Collins and Steve Hackett (drummer John Mayhew and guitarist Anthony Phillips made their final recorded appearance with the band on this album), this version of Genesis lacks the depth and complexity that even their very next follow-up album (Nursery Cryme) would exhibit. Consequently, the songs all tend to sound the same and none are as overtly weird or prone to odd meters as they were to become. One (&quot;Dusk&quot;), in fact, sounds like something you'd hear in the Sixties -- all flowery and sweetly melodic. Yuck.<br />Still, this album scores 3 Stars from me because of its historical value. This is, after all, Genesis. (Yet, I still can't even begin to listen to most of Genesis' '80s output, absolute Pop Pablum For The Masses that it is.) And it still features Peter Gabriel, who was just coming into his own as a vocalist/lyricist. Consider his performance on Tresspass Peter Gabriel Lite. Or Pre-Weird Gabriel. Whatever. It's Peter Gabriel. You gotta love him.<br />If you're already familiar with Genesis, especially the Peter Gabriel-era version, you may, with a bit of effort, find Trespass to your liking. (You'll probably really enjoy &quot;The Knife,&quot; in fact; it's the most Genesis-like of the songs on Trespass.)<br />If you're a fan of the '80s and '90s, Phil Collins-led version, you're likely to hate this album. It's not complex enough to be one of their classics, yet it's not upbeat and Top 40 enough to hold the attention of listeners who prefer their music short, upbeat and saccharine-sweet.<br />Bottom line: You might want to borrow someone's copy of this one before you buy it.
6305041156|5.0|Earlier versions of both the DVD and VHS were nearly criminal.  I had given one of them a single star and remarked what a travesty it was. Now, I have to say I am smitten by the Studio Canal Blu-ray release.  The visual quality is excellent, especially in things that were awful in earlier releases of this classic film.  The clouds, textiles, battle scenes, facial intricacies just make this version come alive!  It is not quite perfect, but darn close.  I am puzzled, however,  by the missing camera shots and scenes.    When the flights of arrows blocked out the Sun during the siege of the third castle during the initial theater release of the film in 1985 I was just blown away. Then subsequent releases on VHS and DVD shortened the shot considerably.  They are not even on this DVD.  The rain storm that soaked and sickened Hidetori just prior to encountering the blind youth that so shocked even Hidetori's conscience is missing, too.  What gives with that?  Still, it is such a radical improvement as a whole that these seem almost trifling complaints.  One of the world's great films is once again enchanting to watch and I applaud the effort!  Let's hope that this presages the remastering and release of some other Japanese films that have thus far eluded DVD release, like The Makioka Sisters and Forest Of The Little Bear.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|This has to be one of the best films of the year.The singing is so so.Kidman stands out way above the rest.The movie is beautifull filmed.Stunning costums,and Kidmans vocals make this a dream come true.Its a bit slow in some places but the rest makes up for it.
B000001FE0|4.0|I found this album in my dad's collection of cassettes that he no longer listened to back in the mid-eighties when I was just beginning my tape collection.  I had long been a fan of the Beatles and had dismissed the BeeGees as just a stupid disco band (I was not as open-minded when I was 15 as I am now...because their &quot;disco&quot; period albums such as &quot;Main Course&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; are pretty great albums in their own right).  However, when I first heard this album coming out of my stereo, I was astounded at just how interesting it was.<br />I love those albums that you can play and transport you to another place for an hour or so...Such is definitely the case with this album.  From the very opening orchestral flourish of the title track you are being whisked away to far away seas.  Ethereal compositions like the lush and beautiful &quot;Edison&quot; and the instrumental orchestral songs such as &quot;Seven Seas Symphony&quot;, &quot;With All Nations&quot; and &quot;The British Opera&quot; continue the journey.  Along the way, you get an album full of catchy, well-sung pop songs.<br />Favorite songs on this album include &quot;Odessa&quot;, the song that begins this epic album, is an oddyssey in itself; &quot;Marley Purt Drive&quot; is catchy, funny and just makes you feel good;  &quot;Melody Fair&quot; is a pretty song and makes me think of a sixties model, whether or not that was the intent;  &quot;Suddenly&quot; has a mysterious quality and to this listener, at least, the singing sounds just like John Lennon; &quot;I Laugh In Your Face&quot; is a beautiful, melancholy song and interesting in that it expresses a non-conformist rebellious attitude in a slow number.<br />In sum, this album is extremely well crafted, well sung and well played.  Sometimes the lyrics seem a bit shallow, but that's a minor complaint for me since the music itself is so good (and I tend to hear the music first and then the lyrics anyway, so it's not that big a deal for me...); and it can be seen as a bit derivative of other sixties groups such as the Beatles and the post-1967 Moody Blues...but all in all THIS IS A VERY GOOD ALBUM.  RECOMMENDED!
B00003CXXS|4.0|Jurassic Park III?  I was thinking the same thing as most, and that was, &quot;Why?&quot;.<br />Why go see this if Spilberg's not directing?<br />Why did they make another one when the second one wasn't any good?<br />I found the awnsers when I picked up this DVD.  Director Joe Johnston brings back the thrills and more importlany fun of the frist move.  The running time is short so the movie has no time to let up or slowdown for a second.<br />All the actors are good, but like in every Jurassic Park movie the real stars are the dinos themselves.  All I have to say is the FX in this movie isn't on par with the others, but they do get the job done.<br />This DVD is worth the purchas
0471413909|5.0|I am fascinated by this diet book -- it makes so much sense! Eating lean meats and fish, veggies, and fruit, and cutting out all the other stuff that is so unnatural and unhealthy for you -- processed grains, refined sugars, and dairy products -- it's a really healthy way to eat and live, even if you don't need to lose weight.  And the recipes and meal plans are so helpful and delicious; this book is a real inspiration to begin eating healthfully once and for all.
0786867973|5.0|Most of the time when I browse the cookbook aisle at my local bookstore, I'm faced with a never-ending array of cookbooks with a couple of good recipes but mostly stuff that I'll never make.  It is hard to find a cookbook that will end up being a treasured repository of personal and family favorites - they just don't come along that often.<br />When I picked this book up, I thought the name was just a good gimmick, a way to get people to take a look.  I was doubtful that there would be much substance behind the nice photography and catchy name.  How wrong I was!  As I went through this book, the exciting and fun looking recipes amazed me.  The recipes weren't all new or flashy, but they were uniformly inspiring.  The first recipe in the book is actually a simple lemony loaf cake recipe...  but it was the first thing I made because it sounded so yummy!  On top of the recipes themselves, the commentary from the author helped me to become enthusiastic about the recipes and about baking in general.<br />The overall style of the cookbook is really nice.  Great pictures for almost all of the recipes.  Clear instructions in the recipes themselves.  The introduction to each recipe was very well written.  Many recipes had variations and other ideas listed.<br />This cookbook is definitely not for everyone.  It does have a British slant both in the commentary and in some of the recipes.  For example, there are several recipes for different kinds of mincemeat pies that I'm doubtful I'll be making anytime soon.  There are also more subtle ways the British slant comes out, especially in the choice of ingredients.  For me, this just added to the charm of the cookbook.  The only negative comment I have about the cookbook is that in some cases, I would have liked an explanation of WHY a certain technique was being used.  For example, in a recipe for a chocolate loaf cake, you are instructed to alternate adding tablespoons of hot water with tablespoons of flour.  I would really liketo know why and that type of explanation would have fit in well with the overall style of the book, but it was missing.<br />Overall, a great and fun cookbook that gave me some inspiration for the holiday season and actually got me back into my kitchen when I was feeling a bit \\"burnt out\\" on baking.
0385505833|5.0|I enjoyed this book from cover to cover!  Just when I thought the spirit of Christmas was lost on these people, the theme of the story turned around, and a wonderful change took place in all of the characters.  Thanks again, John Grisham!
B00005R62K|5.0|Great album, great remaster.  Signal to noise ratio and dynamic headroom capabilities of the PCM medium are finally realised here.  Exciter, Invader and Better By You are hard rock classics.  The current generation won't get it but who cares.  As with all remasters of this sort, buy it before it gets gone.  Incredible sound compared to the original cd release.  And if you like this one get  HELL BENT and British Steel.
6304765789|4.0|No messing around with this plot, from the very beginning Michael Douglas, who plays an extremely wealthy divorced man, is intriguing enough with his character alone to keep you watching. When the action begins, which is pretty quick, you can't stop watching. There is plenty of action and adventure in this movie, but around the middle of it you begin to wonder how much Michael Douglas can take, or rather, how much his character will put up with it. Unfortunately, though the plot is very clever and much like &quot;Total Recall&quot;, it becomes too improbable to take seriously. I was disappointed in that aspect of it, but that didn't make me leave my seat. I enjoyed it very much, I thought Sean Penn and Michael Douglas did an extraordinary job. Good filler for a late and boring afternoon.
B000002WU9|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said by the other people who have reviewed this album. If you are unfamiliar with the various members of the Wu-Tang Clan then you should check my review of &quot;36 Chambers: Enter the Wu&quot; out, where I give a brief description of each artist. I honestly think this album represents the best solo work by any member of the Clan. From start-to-finish this album bangs like a 300-pound gorilla. I will now give a brief description of each track. I'm a huge fan of every member of the Wu (I have every Wu-affiliated album including those of artists and groups like Killah Priest, Killarmy, etc.) but Ghostface is probably my favourite member. As a result, I ask you to please forgive me for focusing on his verses in some of my descriptions.<br />1) &quot;Striving for Perfection&quot; (Produced by The RZA)<BR>The intro to the album, what more can I say about this one.<br />2) &quot;Knuckleheadz&quot; (feat. Ghostface Killah &amp; U-God; Produced by The RZA)<BR>A great first track for a classic album. The RZA's production is (as with most joints on this album) bangin'. Ghost drops one of his best verses on this joint and U-God makes on of his more impressive appearances.<br />3) &quot;Knowledge God&quot; (Produced by The RZA)<BR>Not one of the highlights of the album but this is still a solid track. RZA's solid on the production but it's clear this beat was a bit of an afterthought.Still, I like the message of this song; at the time it was very creative<br />4) &quot;Criminology&quot; (feat. Ghostface Killah; Produced by The RZA)<BR>The RZA takes a real risk with this track and uses an instrumental as the hook. The gamble pays-off in spades and Ghost comes extremely hot to open this joint up and Raekwon has a sick verse too.<br />5) &quot;Incarcerated Scarfaces&quot; (Produced by The RZA)<BR>If this were the only good track on the album it would still be worth buying. Happily that isn't the case, but this joint is so hot it's enough tobuild Raekwon and the RZA storied hip hop reputations on its own.<br />6) &quot;Rainy Dayz&quot; (feat. Ghostface Killah &amp; Blue Raspberry; Produced by The RZA)<BR>Blue Raspberry lends Rae and Ghost her talent on this track and they use the same beat that introduced &quot;Incarcerated Scarfaces&quot; to start this one off. This track would be a highlight on most other hip hop albums and even on this classic piece this joint is still great.<br />7) &quot;Guillotine [Swordz]&quot; (feat. Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, &amp; GZA/Genious; Produced by The RZA)<BR>If you've heard the introduction to Method Man's &quot;Tical&quot; then you've heard the beat that RZA interpolates throughout this piece. For such a simplistic beat it more than shines under hot rhymes from all four emcees. Indeed, it's hard to pick a highlight when every single emcee comes red hot.<br />8) &quot;Can It Be All So Simple [Remix]&quot; (feat. Ghostface Killah; Produced by The RZA)<BR>A solid remix of a Wu classic with a nice beat by RZA. There's really nothing else to say.<br />9) &quot;Shark Niggas [Biters]&quot; (Raekwon &amp; Ghostface Killah)<BR>A better-than-average skit about emcees biting lyrics, beats, and styles from the Wu in the early-mid 1990s.<br />10) &quot;Ice Water&quot; (feat. Ghostface Killah &amp; Cappadonna; Produced by The RZA)<BR>Another hot verse by GHost opens-up another great track featuring another great beat by The RZA. *Whew* Anyway, Cappadonna makes a solid appearance too and Rae's verse is the highlight of this piece.<br />11) &quot;Glaciers of Ice&quot; (feat. Ghostface Killah &amp; Masta Killa; Vocals by Blue Raspberry &amp; 62nd Assasin; Produced by The RZA)<BR>Ghost introduces the track with a nice little skit and Rae follows it up with one of his best verses on the album. Masta Killa then makes the most of one of his two appearances on the album and Blue Raspberry and 62nd Assasin lend their talents to the hook while Ghost proceeds to rip the mic.<br />12) &quot;Verbal Intercourse&quot; (feat. Ghostface Killah &amp; Nas; Produced by The RZA)<BR>This track is memorable because Nas makes a solid appearance. Otherwise though, it's a pretty ordinary song on this album.<br />13) &quot;Wisdom Body&quot; (feat. Ghostface Killah; Produced by The RZA; Produced by The RZA)<BR>A very humorous &quot;blacksploitation&quot; introduction leads into a track wherein Ghost is at his soulful best. Rae then shows he has some soul too.<br />14) &quot;Spot Rusherz&quot; (Produced by The RZA)<BR>A very RZA-like jazzy beat drives this song in which Rae shows what he can do on his own. This is the second best track (behind &quot;Incarceracted Scarfaces&quot;, of course) that Rae has ever done on his lonesome.<br />15) &quot;Ice Cream&quot; (feat. Ghostface Killah, Method Man, &amp; Cappadonna; Produced by The RZA)<BR>This song is an absolute must-hear (if you haven't already). Ghost opens up this piece with what is arguably his best verse ever. I mean, I didn't listen to the whole song through the first few times I heard this track, I just kept rewinding back to Ghost's verse. I wouldn't advise you do that though because Cappadonna drops what is arguably his best verse and Rae does what he always does and slams the mic.<br />16) &quot;Wu-Gambinos&quot; (feat. Ghostface Killah, Method Man, The RZA, &amp; Masta Killa; Produced by The RZA)<BR>I'm not as big a fan of this joint as many people are but it does deserve credit for almost single-handedly creating the mafia-obsession in hip hop. Also, The RZA's beat in this song is very creative.<br />17) &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell&quot; (feat. Ghostface Killah; Produced by The RZA)<BR>Another soulful piece featuring Ghost? It's almost like this song is designed to flow into Ghost's &quot;Ironman&quot; album (which guest stars Raekwon &amp; U-God). Anyway, I'll have a review of that album up in the coming week or so.<br />18) &quot;North Star [Jewels]&quot; (Produced by The RZA)<BR>This bonus track is anice treat for those who picked-up the CD version of the album.
B000001G5A|5.0|This recording deserves an infinite amount of stars. When I first heard this recording, I never thought that Mozart's Requiem could be performed with such a legendary amount of depth and maturity. Every tempo that Karl B&ouml;hm decided to use, made it only obvious, that he was a man of impeccable musical depth, both emotionally, spiritually, and psychologically. He had to be. You can actually FEEL the emotional power of this recording. It's a spiritual sensation! I have read certain reviews in which people have greatly acknowledged other particular recordings for their incredibly bravura, virtuosic, and flamboyant performances. However, it must be realized that this is an EXTREMELY deep and religious work that is primarily for the glory of God. And God, would obviously have no interest in a person who's goal would be to bring recognition upon themselves, for their flamboyant renditions. The first recording that I ever owned of the Mozart Requiem was the fairly new release of the Claudio Abbado recording with the Berlin Philharmonic, which is also on the Deutsche Grammophon recording label (289 463 181-2). I thought that this was a great recording, however, my thoughts immediately changed when I heard this Karl B&ouml;hm recording. I heard a hundred times more detail in this recording than I ever did in Abbado's recording. It made me realize that the Abbado recording is a rather horrible one! For instance, you cannot even hear the organ at all in the Abbado recording. If the Abbado recording was the first recording a person ever heard, he/she would have never known that an organ was supposed to even exist in the Mozart Requiem, unless they looked at the back of the CD case and saw the organist's name printed there! There are tons of other major details that are completely missing in that recording too, however, a person would only be able to realize this if they heard this Karl B&ouml;hm recording. Also, the total performance time of the Abbado recording, is about 49 minutes in length. The total performance time of this Karl B&ouml;hm recording, is about 64 minutes in length!! B&ouml;hm obviously took the greatest amount of time to express his deepest emotions, which makes this recording absolutely incredible. There is NO competition with this recording. This recording MUST be owned, in order to TRULY experience what I believe Mozart intended, during his final hours.length. The total performance time of this Karl Böhm recording, is about 64 minutes in length!! Böhm obviously took the greatest amount of time to express his deepest emotions, which makes this recording absolutely incredible. There is NO competition with this recording. This recording MUST be owned, in order to TRULY experience what I believe Mozart intended, during his final hours.
B00003CXTG|2.0|If you're looking for a great war epic like Saving Private Ryan you'll be greatly disappointed. The interaction between the main characters are shallow and it seems like an hour action movie with 2 hours of thin plots and poor scripts to fill it out. The love plot between the 3 characters are very corny and detracts from an otherwise okay action flick. I must admit the CG effects are very good and the action scenes are great but even with the action it seems to run out of steam towards the end with the raid of Japan scene. It seems very rushed and there's no sense of climax at all. Audio wise it's very average, no big gun sounds but instead sounds very tinny. Actually, the whole movie sounds very tinny besides the explosions which makes decent use of your subwoofer. If you're a die-hard war film fan and you've seen Saving Private Ryan there's little you'll appreciate in this movie.
0385501560|3.0|I've basically come to the conclusion that the first Palahniuk book you read will be your favorite.  So if you haven't touched this guy yet then just pick one (well, my biased opinion would recommend Fight Club, since that was my first read), it will be fresh, a great read, and something that gets you to think.  It will probably even challenge you towards more books and authors that put their books out with something to say, rather than the abundance of authors simply trying to catch your attention span long enough to get on the best seller list.<br />But none of Palahniuk's books ever quite matches the pure elation of my first Palahniuk (though Invisible Monsters did come quite close).  Palahniuk utilizes gimmicks as his style, and while it seems fresh at first, the more of him you read the more it becomes derivative.  Each book is your usual assortment of twists, shocks, catchy-phrases, classic losers, and then the surprise ending.  And each time, no matter how challenging Palahniuk's theme may be, I get a little less interested.  Don't let this mislead you, I'm still a fan of Palahniuk, I've read all four of Palahniuk's books, and they're always good reads.  I'll be one of the first to pick up his next book, but I'm going to be hoping that it's not more of the same.  Being fresh all the time eventually gets stale too.<br />To be fair, and to maybe give some insight as to where I'm coming from, I had the same problem with Vonnegut.  Loved the first book I read by him, had practically just as much fun with my second book.  The third one was enjoyable and just as quick a read as the others, but by the fourth one I was getting the hang of it and didn't really feel the need to read anymore.  This basically mirrors my Palahniuk experience, though Chuck has still got me coming back for more.<br />So in summary, Choke is as good a place to start as any.  For the veterans of Palahniuk, you'll like it too, especially if you haven't tired of his gimmicks yet.  But, as much as you'll likely enjoy it, you probably won't get the same visceral thrills from it as you did with your first Palahniuk novel.as you'll likely enjoy it, you probably won't get the same visceral thrills from it as you did with your first Palahniuk novel.
B00003CXSP|1.0|This is by far the worst made film ever. The plot holes are so large you drive 18 wheelers through them. I did not read the book nor have any desire to. Gory and stupid is the best description! This proves that Hollywood has hit rock bottom. I would rather see a remake of Plan 9 or Robot Monster than this junk. I wish I could have rated it 0 stars. None of the characters are sympathetic. You wish Hannibal dies. No more Hannibal Lecter films please. Anthony Hopkins obviously needed the pay check as his role was very pedestrian. The lovely Juliann Moore was wasted as was my $8.00. DO NOT BUY THIS.... BUY ANYTHING ELSE BUT THIS ONE......
B00005R87Q|4.0|I have seen the fast and the furious multiple times.  It is a good movie.  I am here to just say that the cars are sweet, but american muscle would smoke them.  The 650 hp supra would get toasted by 1300 hp mustangs.  Like the saying go's<br />There is no replacement for displacement.
B000050XEI|4.0|This is my 5th Enya CD I've bought, and is definately the best... almost. It's got 11 wonderful songs, each with its own extraordinary something. However, each song starts with almost the same beat/violin beat, whatever you want to call it that is in &quot;Only Time&quot;. My favorite songs are &quot;Tempus Vernum&quot; and &quot;Flora's Secret&quot; because both of them are very original, as all of them are. <BR>BUT!!! This CD is only for people who really love Enya, and do not get sick of her music too quickly - this CD is only about 35 minutes long. This kept me from giving the CD 5 stars. I was not too happy for paying full-CD-price for only 35 minutes of music, but if you love Enya, its worth it.
0805062971|5.0|this book is the greatest book i've ever read. if you have not yet seen the movie, read the book first, you will enjoy it more.
B00000ILDF|5.0|i now this series which is the best ever is suposed to be horror scince fiction thing but this one has strong emotain like one of the reviers said you see how the aliens have taken everything see ever loved.and theres great felling and of course gore.and the strong ending was perfect it almost made me cry everytime i see ripley sacrifice her self plus it had the right music to go with a greatv part great movie.
B00000JMG7|3.0|Rory's MUST HAVE live disc still remains IRISH TOUR '74, but the second disc of this set is a close second. <br />The first disc, a &quot;live in concert&quot; suffers the same fate as the STAGE STRUCK live disc: poor song selection and less than inspired performances. The playing is merely GOOD, but it seems Rory's fires were burning low and he was counting on volume and distortion to take the place of passion. Unfortunately, it didn't. CALLING CARD and COUNTRY MILE are pretty good.<br />BUT disc two, the IN STUDIO disc... ah, that's a different story all together! Starting with RACE THE BREEZE, this part of the set, recorded between 1971 and 1974 (Rory's peak for me anyway, and excepting WHEN MY BABY SHE LEFT ME (based on SHE CAUGHT THE KATY) recorded in 1986 and also very well done) smokes with the same musical fire that pushed IRISH TOUR'74. The songs are some of the album tracks from Rory's first four solo albums and all are top flight performances. Add the blues of FEEL SO BAD (driven like RACE by a train type rhythym) and HOODOO MAN, this showcases EXACTLY where Rory and his band were in this period. If you get this JUST for the KILLER version of THEY DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE YOU, you won't be disappointed, even when you get to TOREDOWN, the next song.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is not a two hour music video as some have suggested.  It's an either you love or hate it kind of thing.  If you do not like this movie, then I would have to say that it can only be because you are a mindless drone that can only follow the masses.  Non conformists, and people with a high enough intelligence quotient to enjoy pure artistic expression should love it.  The storyline and the songs may be recycled, but it's done with such expertise and artistic vision that it just doesn't matter.  Every single image throughout the entire movie is a complete artistic arrangement.  Through that together with a cacophony of music that completely stuns the senses, one is forced through the downward spiral which holds the whole movie together.  After I watched the movie, I read that it was modeled on Orpheus' decent into the underworld.  I immediately thought, &quot;Yes!&quot;  This best describes the movie.  It is not just a love story.  It is about a man who is completely sucked into a strange world where he should never have been to start with.  It's absolutely amazing.  One would have to watch this movie many times in order to understand the full extent of what is going on.  Certainly read the insert.  It gives much insight into the basic point of view of the movie.
B00001OH7G|4.0|Long lost in the sands of time, Rory Gallagher might have been the best slide guitar player in the world after Duane Allman died (apologies to Johnny Winter, but it's true). But while Duane was doing circles and endless blues jams with Dickie Betts, Rory was touring with his crack band and developing his knife edged slide playing. And this album is a peak for both he and that band.<br />Starting with the firey CRADLE ROCK Rory throws on the throttle and never lets up. Oh, he'll slow down like on I WONDER WHO and Tony Joe White's AS THE CROW FLIES (done acoustic on a National steel ala Mississippi Fred McDowell) but he'll crank it right back up on WHO'S THAT COMING and the album's centerpiece, the brilliant WALK ON HOT COALS, an version that smokes the studio take. And the man just drips music. You can hear it on the aformentioned CROW.<br />Rory hass three or four live albums available, but THIS is the one to get if you can only get ONE. If you like this, get the BBC SESSIONS.<br />The fact that so few people know Rory's music still saddens me. But I know this is one I reccommend to anyone who's interested in slide guitar or someone that no one else has heard of.
0060245867|5.0|The Greatest childrens book i have ever read and one of my favorites. It has wonderful pictures of the cute little mouse. It is about a mouse that goes nad a big edventure and ends up getting into lots of things. This little mouse has a big imangination. As you turn the pages you will start to chuckle at all the different things he thinks of. This mouse is definetly never bored! He has a little boy that helps him when he thinks of things to do and by the end of the story he is all worn out. This book is sure to put a smile on your face. It would be a great book to read to a child when he/she says there is nothing to do and they are bored. Every time i read this story i seem to get a laugh at it.
B00004Y62T|4.0|I think most people would agree that MOST movies-made-from-books don't even come close to the books themselves. Orders of events are changed, minor characters are deleted, even entire sections of the plots are left out for &quot;artistic reasons&quot; (or simply because it costs too much to include them in the film). If you're lucky, you see the movie and THEN read the book; otherwise, you're left utterly disappointed.<br />Well, I read &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; before seeing it on video. And I was hesitant about seeing the movie, as the book was incredibly rich and very deep, especially in character development. I had huge doubts that the movie could do the book justice. But to my very pleasant surprise, they seemed to have pulled it off somehow.<br />This movie is actually almost as good as the book -- amazing!!<br />Matt Damon is absolutely superb as Tom Ripley. He looks like Tom, has his mannerisms, has his voice. Damon is SO successful at portraying Tom Ripley as Highsmith had written of his character in her book:  A conniving, pathetic psychopath, who disgusts you but also somehow manages to make you feel sorry for him in the process. A very tough role for any actor, but Damon was excellent.<br />Likewise, Jude Law is wonderful at portraying the likeable extrovert Dickie Greenleaf -- a rich kid who's lazing away in Italy on Daddy's money, but who still doesn't come across as a selfish snob. Gwyneth Paltrow does a good job as hesitant Marge, who lacks self-confidence and only wants Dickie to reciprocate the devotion she has for him. My only complaint about having Paltrow in this role is that I feel she is too pretty to play Marge, as in the book Marge is a bit more homely. But still, Paltrow gets Marge's personality down pat, which is most important.<br />The other thing that is pulled off nicely in the movie is the adaptation of the scenery and historical era of the book. The on-location scenes in Italy are breathtaking -- makes you want to be in Italy yourself! Before seeing the movie, I was afraid that the director had chosen to modernize the story, placing it in the latter 20th century. To my surprise he didn't, but instead stayed true to the story's place in the 1950s. This allowed the movie to have that &quot;old&quot; feel that the book also had.<br />Since the book focused on the characters primarily and the plot secondarily, this movie gets four stars from me. However, I can't give a fifth star because, unfortunately, the movie lacks some very important portions of the plot, which changes the tale a bit. And considering that the book was only 290 pages to begin with, I'm not sure why the moviemakers couldn't have fit as much in as possible.<br />All in all, this film did what most others in its catagory can't -- do justice to the novel upon which it is based.

0060245867|5.0|This book has been one of my favorites since I was a child.<BR>It has always put a smile on my face every time I read it. It is about this little mouse that has these big adventures. He has such a big imagination he cant figure out what he wants to do next. He is always busy and never sits down to relax. This is a great book for your children when they say I am bored, or there is nothing to do. Everytime you turn a page you will chuckle a little at the big mess the little mouse gets into. Everything he does seams to relate to somthing else. He never realy finishes what he starts. By the end of this book you see how tired out the little boy who is helping him must be. This book is very entertaining and has plenty of pictures to go along with the story. It will keep you guessing what is going to happen next.
B000005H40|5.0|It is easy to see why 'Blue Train' is one of the best-selling and most loved jazz albums of all time.  From the famous, if untypically intense, opening bars of the title track, Coltrane is dedicated to offering the purest pleasure, now laidback, now party-swinging, a far cry from the far-out experimentation of his later work.  With Paul Chambers' bass and Philly Joe Jones' drums furiously fretting like slaves on a Roman galley, Coltranes' sax blows melody after honeyed melody, mostly upbeat, with 'Locomotion' indicating both the music's forward momentum and its sense of taking you on a journey; but also reflective and nostalgic, as in the tight but beautifully brooding 'I'm Old Fashioned'.  I particularly love the wood-twanging bass solos on 'Moment's Notice' and 'Lazy Bird'.  <br />This kind of music has been a lazy signifier of 'cool' in innumerable night-club scenes from films and TV shows, but Coltrane's quiet intelligence ensures this remains as fresh and fun as the day it was recorded.  It may be asking too much for an album that puts a huge grin on your face to also burn your soul - for that you must look elsewhere.
B00005A46T|5.0|Just shut up already.  How many people come here to write a review to slag the band and then go on to mention various &quot;true&quot; metal bands and how they are so much better?  I know all of those bands mentioned plus a ton of others that those cool &quot;underground metal d00des&quot; has never heard, so your ramblings hold no water with me.  With all that I have heard, I still listen to Slipknot, ALOT.<br />Okay, they are not the most brutal, or the most technical, or the most scary, or the most insane, but they have a little bit of everything which makes them enjoyable to listen to, especially on this album.  Corey sings, screams, and curses.  The music goes from brutal to quiet, all the while maintaining some type of psychotic aura about it.  The bottom line is they have some good songs to bash someone elses's head to.  Album highlights include &quot;People=S__t&quot;, &quot;My Plague&quot;, &quot;The Shape&quot;, &quot;I am Hated&quot;, &quot;New Abortion&quot;, &quot;Iowa&quot;, and the creepy remake of &quot;Gently&quot;.<br />I look at Slipknot like professional wrestling: big on image, a little contrived, but still having substance and always very entertaining. This album deserves 5 stars and having listened to it for 4 months, IS better than the first.<br />I'll now name-drop to keep the current trend going.<br />If you like insanely technical (no 2 chord songs for me!) go with Spiral Architect.  If you like something br00tal, go with Suffocation.  If you want something slighty odd, go with Arcturus.  If you want something depressing, go with Katatonia.  If you want something beautiful, go with Anathema.  Did I do well all-knowing metal masters? Ugh

B000002GKT|4.0|Well, my older brother owned this one on vinyl and I remember how I used to listen to it over and over,and how much I enjoyed it. So ...how does it sound now in 2001. <BR>Firstly the sound quality is excellent,especially for a live album,with headphones on you are there..!!!.<BR>The music ...well the music is great.I had forgotten just how good these guys were.The interplay between all four musicians is wonderful, creating a unique and powerful rock sound that other bands are still trying to imitate today.The chemistry between the four was( alas )lost to us forever shortly after this album was recorded when Peter Frampton decided to go solo.We can now only imagine how the band would have developed had he stayed, but they were certainly never the same band after he left ( although the next album  \\"Smokin\\" has it's fair share of fans).Personally ,I enjoy the longer tracks where Marriot and Frampton get room to really stretch out and shine,and of course it is the longer jams that pave the way for the total riot of the finale. I would recommend this disc to anyone looking for a some REAL rock music.<BR>This disc should be in anyone's \\"top ten live rock albums \\" list for sure.
B000056PWV|4.0|Rear Window is somewhat languidly paced, lacking the taut direction of some of Hitchcock's best films (Notorious, North by Northwest, Dial M for Murder, etc.), and this one-set movie does start to feel claustrophobic.  I was hoping for Stewart to be able to get out of that wheelchair, leave his small apartment with the oversized lamp shade, and get out into the world.<br />The climax was a bit disappointing.  It is chilling to hear Burr coming up the stairs, but once he comes in to the apartment he just starts asking questions -- that's not too scary!  And he doesn't even have a weapon on him!<br />It's not one of Hitchcock's best films, but it still is interesting and entertaining.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Being a Pink fan for about a year and a half now, I've grown to appreciate the way she feels about things. From her relationship with her family to her eccentric personality all the way up to her crazy dress and hard-rock inspired tunes. She is an inspiration to all girls who are not \\"perfect.\\" As she says \\"tired of bein' compared to d*** Britney Spears, she's so pretty, that just ain't me.\\" <br /> The tracks on this CD are refreshing from other music out right now. They are everywhere from dark to confident, quirky to downright defiant. Pink is the singer who redefined teen R&B for me. With this disc, she attacks teen pop with an edgy rock sound.<br />The tracks:<br />1. M!ssundaztood: The intro might seem irritating or even cheesy at first, but is a great song once you're used to the \\"flavor\\" of it. The hidden irony in the lyrics, such as \\"always on the wrong track, lookin' for the right track, and are you catchin' all these tracks that I'm layin' down for you?\\" add to the appeal. Pink does some \\"grunts\\" near the end of the song and isn't afraid to poke fun at herself. \\"This ain't no d*** ex-lax commercial, this is my first single, man!\\" *****<BR> <BR>2. Don't Let Me Get Me: A personal favorite (as are most of the tracks), this song is about self-hate and self-dout. \\"Oh, I'm a hazed to myself/don't let me get me/I'm my own worst enemy.\\" Finding who you are and hating who you are. Two very important things teens deal with today and a remarkable song that shows that. *****<br />3. Just Like A Pill: The clever comparisons in this song make it one of the most liked on the CD (and rumoured to be the next single). \\"I swear, you're just like a pill/'stead of makin' me better/you keep makin' me ill.\\" This is just a great song. *****<br />4. Get The Party Started:I really can't say I like this song much and releasing it as the first single seems like a mistake to me. Nothing on the album sounds like this song. I do appreciate it's defiant nature, though. ***<br />5. Respect: \\"This' my rap song\\" Pink declares at the beginning. Don't expect Aretha's calm, collected and dignifid r-e-s-p-e-c-t on this one. \\"Give it up, he won't call you,\\" she says. While a little hip-hop flavored, it sticks to the theme of the album and the strength of Pink's character. ****<BR> <BR>6. 18 Wheeler: Here again, marvelous metaphors. While this is a song supposedly containing the \\"f word,\\" it is edited \\"you can run over me with your eighteen wheeler truck and I won't give a...\\" You might not like it at first, but it really grows on you. *****<br />7. Family Portrait: This is such an amazing song. If you've lived through a divorce, you can relate to every word. Even if you personally have not experienced divorce, the pain is so real in this song. You feel every word. *****<br /> 8. Misery (w/Steven Tyler) : Okay, but not my style. ***<br />9. Dear Diary: Here again, not my style of song ***<br />10. Eventually: This one goes out to all the people who tried to stop or hurt P!nk in some way. But does she hold a grudge? You bet! \\"They'll get their eventually, and I hope I'm there.\\" *****<BR> <BR>11. Lonely Girl (w/Linda Perry): All I'm going to present to the *AMAZING* song is the chorus: \\"Do you even know who are (Oh, I'm still tryanna find)/A fallen dream or a rising star (I wanted to be a star)/Is life good to you or is it bad (I can't tell anymore)\\" *************<BR> <BR>12. Numb: Yet another amazing pop-tinged R&B song. Just love the beat of this one. *****<BR> <BR>13. Gone To California: One of the weaker tracks, but still pretty strong. ***<BR> <BR>14. My Vietnam: Life is everyone's Vietnam, this song is not a winning battle of the album, though. ****<br />All in all, an incredible CD with few tracks less than five star-rated. How much more could you ask for?
0767824571|4.0|This film veers between inspired lunacy and stupid silliness without seeming to know the difference.  But say what you will, the movie is never boring.<br />I love the scene with the young prince and his incompetent palace guards and the tale of &quot;courageous&quot; Sir Robin and his minstrals.  The animation is very well done, like illuminated medieval manuscripts come to life.<br />Note: The DVD I am reviewing does not contain many extras -- just some trailers for other films.
B000001ESN|4.0|By the time this album was released in 1980, a new Rush was beginning to emerge as the band decided to leave the sound that the band had stayed with for most of the 70's (with the exception of the first album which is in a category by itself).  With Permanent Waves, a leaner, meaner Rush began to take hold and, as a result, more airplay, record sales, and an even larger fan base came into being.<br />This is nowhere better displayed than on the widely recognized, radio friendly (what else?), &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot;. This is a more compact song with down-to-earth lyrics that could not be said of much (not all) of the 70's material. The longer songs that were on many of the band's earlier albums were still hanging around in the forms of &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; and even more so in &quot;Natural Science&quot;, both quality songs, especially the latter.<br />However, my favorite songs on the album are &quot;Entre Nous&quot;, and an uncharacteristically sounding &quot;Different Strings&quot;.  This was the beginning of a sound that would last for much of the 80's, and arguably even longer. The next album, Moving Pictures, would even be superior to this one but PW is still a good buy. Enjoy.
0679737456|3.0|An okay book that sort of bogs down as it goes on.  I guess I got tired of the self-reflexion after awhile.  I had gone to a racially mixed high school (not a boarding one, however), so I could relate to some of the author's experiences.
0441172717|5.0|The Dune series truly is a wonderful collection of sci-fi books.  The vividness and completeness of the 'alternate reality' being portrayed is staggering.  You truly are thrown into another world; given the number of books available, you can 'wallow in it' for quite some time.  If you want a break from everyday reality, dive into these books and don't surface until you need food, sleep, etc.
B0000025US|5.0|After nearly twenty years, this is still some of the most perfectly beautiful and emotionally intense music ever recorded,played by three of the world's finest guitarists.
0812550706|5.0|Is this how warfare of the future will be fought?  How generals of the future will be trained?  Who knows.  Possibly.  The ending is superb, and most definitely thought-provoking and intriguing.  Intense ideas imho.
0451203933|5.0|I read this book with intentions about not getting through the book.  True war situations.  A truly great book.
B00005JKES|1.0|I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the DVD today.  When I played the first episode (believing it to be the &quot;first&quot; episode, hence the very first time we see any of the characters...) it was preceeded by a &quot;previously on Twin Peaks...&quot;  I couldn't believe the DVD was released without the pilot attached to it...why even bother?  For people like myself who haven't seen this show in over 10 years, it's hard to remember all that happened in the very first show.  &quot;The First Season&quot; - right.  Just don't expect it to be &quot;The COMPLETE First Season&quot;.  Extremely disappointing.
6302453356|4.0|This movie could have been great. The scenes with Hoffman and Hoskins are superb and worth the price of the VHS. It's just too bad that you have to wade through tinkerbell and the lost boys to get to the good stuff. My kids love it though and I am able to watch it over and over and over and over because of the good parts. (My kids will come and find me to tell me my favorite part is coming up) Unfortunately Hoffman, Hoskins and Smith were not able to pull the rest of the cast up to their level of artistic abilities.
B000059QYB|5.0|I bought this cd for my best friend because she loves Billy Idol.  However, me being me, I've never been above tearing the plastic off and giving and intended gift a &quot;test run&quot; before the gifting.  With this one, I should've left it unopened because I ended up keeping it.  There were songs on here that I hadn't heard in years and it was a blast listening to &quot;cradle of love&quot; and &quot;rebel yell&quot; while driving the highway at night.  It's been a while since last April and I've yet to give this to her, buit then again, Christmas is JUST around the corner...
B00003CXTF|1.0|This movie is obviously about the attack on Pearl Harbor. But it is extremely flawed. <BR>Historically, there are many incorrect facts. One example is <BR>when Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck are flying their planes low above the airfield and they are communicating via radios to the guy down on the runway. <BR>The love story is corny, and the tragedy of the attack and &quot;sadness&quot; of the love story is so obviously forced, I find it actually dishonorable to the real life attack on Pearl Harbor. The love story is very predictable, and overly acted, and most definitely not helped by corny lines like &quot;I'll never look at another sunset without thinking of you&quot;. <BR>The battle is okay, but filled with way too much computerized animation. A lot of the effects were so obviously CG effects. The CG effects actually get repetitive. Just about everytime a CG airplane explodes or crashes, chunks of it fly at the camera. It looks cool if it is done once or twice, but not 20 times. But ILM still did a great job. They are the only reason why the movie gets a 1. Really a one and a half. I congratulate them on a movie well computerized.<BR>The Japanese perspective on the lead-up to Pearl Harbor is enjoyable, and just about the only best part in the movie. But it looks like it is their just to pass the time. And the scenes that you do see are rushed. The scene where the dialogue goes something like &quot;I fear all we did was to awaken a sleeping giant&quot; is the most important piece of dialogue in the movie, but it isn't given enough screen time for it to really sink into the viewer.<BR>The second tape is just a weak attempt at making the movie an epic movie, and really just made the movie seem like it was dragging on. And the presentation in widescreen kept giving me the feeling that the director did that so it would look more epic. Talk about falling flat on your face.<BR>Then there is the whole end to the battle. The end makes it seem as if we won when we really didn't. Pearl Harbor was a huge loss to America. But the movie gives the false sense that we won.<BR>Anyways, there is so much to criticize, but this is already long enough. In short, the movie is horrible and corny. It was so bad that &quot;I'll never go to bed without thinking of how terrible this movie was.&quot;
B00005R2M3|4.0|This is the first Shakira CD I've bought and I really like it! The more I listen to it, the more it grows on me. Each song is very different from the last and her lyrics are for the most part unusual and interesting. I can relate to a lot of what she's saying. She reminds me at times of Jewel and Gwen Stefani. Overall, a really good album! It makes me want to buy her Spanish albums!
B00003CXXP|4.0|Spielburg and Kubrick are kindred in &quot;AI&quot;.  Conceptually Kubrick presents questions like &quot;What is it that makes a human conciousnous?&quot; and &quot;What difference is their between love and adoration.&quot;  These conceptual questions could never be presented by Kubrick for this film (as many times as he tried).  The Project was missing one ingredient.<BR>      Spielburg and his time tested genius for showmanship new the angle.  He presents the film from the view of a child.  He shoots a film in which he actually seeks to define, Love, Life and humanity.  The audience has to come without pretense in order to hear the voice of the future and the cry of the past.
6302787300|5.0|This was an excellent movie; the historical aspect being decently faithful. A good watch, if not a bit long. Although why a Frenchman plays an Italian is anybody's guess. The villain, don Adrian de Moxica, is played by the bad boy of bad boys, Michael Wincott. He plays the troublesome nobleman excellently. I consider it his best yet, although i haven't seen Along Came a Spider...<br />It basically tells of Cristobal Colombo's (Gérard Depardieu) journies to America and all of the obstacles he had to overcome in order to get there. Queen Isabella (Sigourney Weaver) is eventually sympathetic to his cause and sends him on his way. The treasurer of Spain, among others, object strongly, and object again when she funds him a second time. His travels never unearth the gold he promised, and he ends up in bad graces. But it all ends well enough. <br />I think this movie is good for anyone who is interested in historical events, particularly the discovery and colonization period, who must also be willing to sit through the two tapes. The action keeps it moving at a decent rate most of the time, but there are a few slow scenes. The action-packed ones do, in my opinion, make up for it admirably.
B000050IL0|5.0|My father bought a vinyl copy of the CBS Masterworks recording of this same performance when I was in high school.  A taped copy of this served me admirably in college in the late '80s, making my study time that much more structured and productive.  After absconding with my father's record, I was later able to buy it on CD.  I still have the record, though...<br />     Imagine my surprise and unfettered delight when I learned that the recording sessions for this now-timeless masterpiece were actually recorded on film.  This happened to me in the mid-90's, when I saw this film at the American Film Institute theatre at the Kennedy Center.  There on the screen, in the same studios where Kind of Blue was recorded, was the vision to go with those sounds that had become a part of me.  It was like being blind for years and all of a sudden being given the gift of sight.<br />     And now, this is available on a DVD.  Who gives a damn about what extras there are.  The Aria, 30 variations, and Aria are all there and you get to SEE Glenn Gould perform them!!  What else of such great value could you ever hope to acquire for such a small price...
B0000584V3|5.0|This album is incredible from beginning to end -- well played acoustic guitars blend effortlessly with hard edged, distorted instruments and driving beats.  Divine vocals juxtaposed with angry growls.  Thinking man's metal delivered in a first class manner.
B00005MP58|1.0|Our family wore out our VHS tapes of this outstanding miniseries. We have also really enjoyed the earlier DVD release that we checked out from the local library. With huge enthusiasm we looked forward to this new version. DRAT! It turned out to be virtually unwatchable.  Not only was the color completely washed out, but the movements were jerky and not always syncronized with the sound. Thinking we just somehow had been sent a faulty disk we returned it and tried again but the replacement was no better. Perhaps there was just a bad batch of DVDs manufactured, but we are hesitant to try again. (I see that many others have had the same problem.)
B00000K3UR|5.0|This was the greatest movie I've ever seen.  I am not a huge Adam Sandler fan, but I LOVED this movie!!  I've seen it numerous times and would watch it 100 times more!  It made me laugh and cry...you gotta see it!
B00000ILBK|4.0|Insurrection has had much negative reaction from many a fan, as well as a horde of loyalists who enjoy it for its character development. Insurrection is very much an entry into the Next Generation TV series genre of stories, seldom having the feel of a &quot;Big Screen&quot; sci fi action film, but more of the close-knit character-based stories you expected to see in the series. This works well as a contrast to the much more action-driven predecessor, &quot;First Contact,&quot; allowing you to see that the crew of the Enterprise are about much more than &quot;saving the world as we know it.&quot;<br />Insurrection begins with one of the most beautiful opening sequences of any Star Trek story. The scenery, the music, all building the impression that this is truly a paradise (all while opening credits are rolling). It makes for quite a contrast to the opening credits for many of the other feature films, which typcially show elongated credit rolls over space shots, sometimes with a climactic conclusion (for example, the explosion of the Klingon moon in Star Trek VI). The contrast Insurrection then takes with the Federation Observation Post hints that all is not well in this picture-perfect, peaceful world. Certainly not all is what it seems. And Data's behavior quickly seems to confirm those suspicions.<br />Strong points throughout this movie are the characterizations of the Enterprise crew and their comfort in interacting with each other. There are many elements of humor in this story, but each seems in step with the characters and their comfort levels with each other. And many are almost &quot;flashbacks&quot; to the television series. Picard singing Gilbert &amp; Sullivan to &quot;make contact&quot; with Data harkens back to the numerous episodes that depicted Data and Picard practicing plays aboard the Enterprise. And Worf's reluctance to sing is completely in character. As the crew begins to experience the effects of the solar system (growing younger, so to speak), we see Riker reverting to his previous, clean-shaven self and with a renewed interest in Troi. And the joke between Troi and Crusher about &quot;firming up&quot; is portrayed in a way that shows the comfort the two have with each other to discuss those matters (a comfort developed over their years of service together).<br />While the basic story is interesting enough, sadly it does not leave one wanting to watch this one multiple times. Once you know the ending, the movie then becomes a novelty, but not one you want to review and re-watch countless times. Or, if you do, you may want to just rewatch the first half.<br />There are several scenes in this film which merit criticism. One such scene is the &quot;freezing&quot; of a moment in time that occurs with Picard and his love interest. It comes out of nowhere, has little explanation, and serves no point. How is she able to do this? What is the point of this exercise? Yes, it forshadows something yet to come, but can we really believe that this particular action is even possible?<br />Regardless of the negative points inherent in this story, I am confident that if this were broadcast as part of the TV series as opposed to being a &quot;Big Screen&quot; theatrical release, it would have received more positive reviews than it did. If you enjoyed the Next Generation TV episodes (especially the latter years), you should enjoy this as a welcome addition to the series. If you are looking for an action-packed adventure where the Enterprise blows up or comes out looking like it warped through Hell, then this will probably not satisfy.
B000005DQR|5.0|DJ Shadow is, undisputably, an incredible mixer and uncategorizable musician, so I won't tell you what you've already heard.  This record is beautiful.  There are moments (i.e. Midnight) when you almost want to cry!  The sound is that gorgeous.  Only one thing turns me off of that song at all-- the ending.  Throughout the song, Shadow chopps up the words &quot;Now it's time for Midnight,&quot; which sounds really cool, until the guy actually yells &quot;Midnight!!&quot; and you kind of feel embarassed for him.  But don't let that you stop you from buying this disc!  I'm a serious fan of jungle drum and bass, and this stuff isn't jungle, it isn't &quot;hip hop&quot; and I don't know where that assumption was conceived, but as one other reviewer said, it's just great muisic.<br />BUY THIS CD!!! You'll love it forever.
B000002H97|2.0|This album was long anticipated, it came out, and anyone who was already a fan of Metallica had to be disappointed, I know I was.....this is the beginning of the end, forget anything after this point......
B000055ZB8|4.0|If you can get past the antiquity of this film (it looks like it was made in an Edison lab) you are in for the treat of one of the creepiest vampire movies around. Lots of images that will give you the willies. Director Murnau is in great form here.
B00005Q66T|2.0|I found this CD a waste of money.
6305075492|3.0|Another silent film that has not aged too well but is still of great interest to lovers of silent film and film history. The plot is none too innovative but the wild, original sets made this one stand out from the crowd. The direction is actually a bit wooden. It is the work of the set designers which actually made this one a stunning experience to early film audiences.
B000000OMP|4.0|It this album had not the lame lyrics it has, it would have been an all-time hard rock classic. As it is, is a real portrait of the quality of the musicians involved: Coverdale on vocals, Moody and Galley on guitar, Lord on keyboards, Hodgkinson o bass and the late Cozy Powell on drums. Also, producer is wizard Martin Birch. Why Coverdale chose to follow the way of silly love lyrics (my God, there are 3 tunes with the world &quot;love&quot; included in their tittles here!!!!!) is something beyond my imagination. The theme plagues Whitesnake records from this point onwards. Anyway, the music is powerful, the instruments are tight. After this, the band would suffer a total reformulation for 1985: gone were guitarrists Moody and Galley, and in came John Sykes; gone was Hodgkinson and in came Neil Murray; gone was Jon Lord (dont know who came). Unfortunately, this was a move that turned WHITESNAKE into a musical game of chairs in the style of Rainbow, Malmsteen, Michael Schenker, etc, a thing that is most cases prevented a band to sustain credibility, identity and longevity.
0800103661|4.0|Many science fiction films have a major flaw - their total lack of appeal to a broad range of people - yet 'Gattaca' succeeds on many levels.  In we're introduced to Vincent (Ethan Hawke), a man of natural birth (or an 'in-valid') whose life expectancy is 30.  Vincent longs for deep space travel but knows that he'll never amount to anything but a cleaner with his genes.  So he grabs the opportunity to pass himself off as 'valid' Jerome (Jude Law) who has been crippled.  However, things start to go wrong when a murder investigation and pretty co-worker Irene (Uma Thurman) get closer to figuring out the truth.<br />This is an immensely intriguing idea that is carried off well with both a realistic and disquieting view of the future.  Never truly alone and programmed to be able to do only one specific thing means that dreams and aspirations are thrown out of the window.  Among other things it also functions as an efficient thriller and love story.  For these reasons it's unusual that this movie didn't do better at the box office.<br />As a romantic story it works a lot better than, say, 'Blade Runner' (Hawke and Thurman are married in real life) but the film is quite happy to cater to all tastes and it's difficult to pigeon-hole this as merely science-fiction.  It has echoes of books such as 'Brave New World' and the incredibly realised future is at once elegant, absorbing and terrifying.  Yet it never loses sight of the human spirit, with Jude Law's performance being especially mesmerising as the perfect person that has to live with his incapacity and watch a stranger live his life for him.<br />However, maybe the best praise for 'Gattaca' is that I loved it, and I'm not a science-fiction fan.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Without a doubt, this is their finest work.  They have really progressed as songwriters/musicians, and I think they're at the top of their game.  This isn't the commercial pop sappy stuff where every song is a radio-friendly hit. but rather...they ventured into new sounds and it came out quite well. I've been a fan for about 6 years, and this is really good stuff.  Buy it now and you won't regret it.
1577311523|5.0|I've never written a review before (although I read them often). This book does not need yet another raving review, yet I feel compelled to do so. Tolle's book has the same trappings of many &quot;spiritual guidance&quot; books: difficulty in bringing the philosophy to practical &quot;American&quot; living; regurgitating the same answer to too many scenarios; and it pulls the reader quickly along when the philosophy comes down to faith. I only mention these in order to be make clear my objectivity. Beyond a doubt, I found this book refreshing in a way no other has. I've long been confind by an identity created by my mind through an intricate maze of acheivements, failures, pleasures, pains... forever reliving the past and creating fantasies about the future. Right now I feel clean, light, and empowered. Who could ask for more?
B00003CX9S|5.0|The Hughes Brothers' recent release FROM HELL includes a brief (and surely unexpected) appearance by one John Merrick, better known as 'the Elephant Man'.  Merrick's inclusion in a movie about Jack the Ripper points up the odd connections between these two figures.  Both represented extremes of degradation (moral in one case, physical in the other) that had never been seen before; both aroused horror and fascination in equal degrees; and both were major press sensations - all in the same district of London at roughly the same time.  Indeed, John Merrick and Jack the Ripper might even be seen as yin and yang: while the Ripper's (presumably normal) exterior masked a heart of the blackest evil, Merrick's hideous body housed one of the kindest and gentlest souls ever to grace this planet.    This beautiful soul is the focus of David Lynch's magnificent film, THE ELEPHANT MAN.  Broadly speaking, the film is a true story; while a fair portion of the details are either totally fictitious or conflated from several real-life sources, the general outline of the script is true. It follows Merrick from his first encounter with Dr Frederick Treves (Hopkins), the man who helped him regain his dignity, until his death trying to \\"sleep like normal people\\" - this final scene being only one of many unforgettable moments in the film.    The cast of THE ELEPHANT MAN is utterly top-notch.  With only his eyes visible beneath Christopher Tucker's extraordinary makeup, John Hurt manages to give a tremendously moving performance in the title role.  You won't soon forget his recitation of the 23rd Psalm, his heartbreaking teatime visit to Treves's wife (a fine cameo by Hannah Gordon), or his reading of Romeo to Anne Bancroft's Juliet (another great cameo).  Anthony Hopkins once again proves himself to be among the greatest actors of our time; his performance as Treves is nicely nuanced, evincing subtle and deeply human contradictions, where a lesser actor might have portrayed a mere two-dimensional Virtuous Leading Man. John Gielgud is his usual brilliant self, Freddie Jones is excellent as the sinister yet somehow tragic Mr Bytes, and the various supporting roles are all up to the very high standard set by these leading players.     Since 1980 was the year of RAGING BULL and ORDINARY PEOPLE, it is perhaps understandable that THE ELEPHANT MAN didn't win any of the 8 Academy Awards for which it was nominated - though in my opinion it is every bit as good as either of those films.  What is scandalous, however, is the fact that Freddie Francis's stunning black-and-white cinematography wasn't even nominated.  (Francis did pick up his second Oscar, for Edward Zwick's GLORY, a few years later.)     Lynch's direction, finally, is a revelation.  This was only his second film, and he was working with some of the greatest actors living at the time, but his hand has never been surer.  Not until THE STRAIGHT STORY (also, incidentally, photographed by Francis) would he again attempt so direct a presentation, but the results here are simply superb.  There isn't a hollow note or an empty image in the entire film, which is more than one can say for some of Lynch's later efforts.      The DVD's picture quality is excellent, the sound likewise.  Extras include the theatrical trailer, some interesting bits concerning Christopher Tucker's makeup, and a brief documentary featuring comments from Tucker, John Hurt, Freddie Francis, producer Jonathan Sanger, and (uncredited) executive producer Mel Brooks (yes, that Mel Brooks).  It would have been nice to hear something from David Lynch as well, but all things considered, this is a fairly minor quibble.  A great film and a great DVD - pick it up today.

0375703861|5.0|I went into this book with phasers set on kill--the author was too young and the hype too intense.  But Smith disarmed me in 50 pages flat.  Beneath the humor and verbal swagger the other reviewers mention there's a very liberal, hopeful message about race--what we all really want is the freedom to be our messy selves.  Race and religion, genetics and history give simple answers to the old &quot;who am I?&quot; question that just don't hold up in our blessedly mongrel world.  Yeah, the story wobbles a bit at the end, but so what?  Smith's built up so much good will by then that you feel like a heel even noticing.  I'll bite into her next book if it's only half as good.
0446608955|4.0|I originally ordered this book because I was ordering another book off amazon and it's cheaper to order a few things with shipping and handling and I also saw a preview for the Mandy Moore movie the same day, so I figured &quot;Why not?&quot;. I was really suprised when I read it because surpassed my expectations by about 100% :) This book had so many emotions, it literally made me laugh and cry during one sitting while reading the book. I suggest this to every teenage girl because it is such a feel-good book it can pick up your bad day.
B00003CY5I|4.0|dramatic,good,interesting,the score is a sizzling movie and  you never know what is going to happen next.The cast gives the BEST performance.The best is Edward Norton,who is the cream of the crop.Robert De Niro gives a great performance too.Marlon Brando has such a small but interesting roll.And of corse Angela Basset gives a ok roll but very small roll too.In the end you will be rooting for De Niro to get &quot;The Score&quot;,but more for Norton.The ending is heart-wrenching for  true Ed Norton fans and people rooting for him.This is a semi-must see.
B00004RFFL|3.0|This science-fiction thriller has some good scenes, but overall, it really is only a not quite successful attempt to make a science-fiction rip-off of Rosemary's Baby. Charlize Theron even has a haircut that resembles that of Mia Farrow in the second half of that movie. But here's very little of the suspense and tension that movie had, and in some scenes the stupidity of the characters - at least Jillian, the Charlize Theron character - gets annoying. Johnny Depp and Clea DuVall (as Jillian's sister) are good, and the other actors are average. <br />I don't recommend you to buy this movie. Rent it or watch it on TV if you're curious and want to see it. If I could, I would give it two and a half stars.
B00003CXE7|5.0|What can I say, this is the best movie I have ever seen, when I saw the trailer on t.v I knew it was going to be a box-office hit at least, but when I saw the movie, just for the first scene, the Battle, I knew this was the best movie of the year and the best movie yet. I saw it on the premiere and not many people believed my comments, but afterwards most of my relatives and friends agreed with me, this is a G R E A T movie, for years we had been expecting, or at least I had been expecting a great movie, and after the Titanic disappointment, I though it would never come, but oh boy Ridley Scott did a terrific job in accomplishing this, making a both emotional and exiting and visually alluring film, then he went on an made another amazing movie, Hannibal, not as great, but sure a great movie to spend 2 hours and 20 minutes of your time watching Anthony Hopkins do what he does best, be Hannibal \\"the cannibal\\" Lecter. But lets talk Gladiator, Russell Crowe is great, no wander he won the Oscar for his performance, I would have lost all my respect to the award if he didn't. Joaquin Phoenix should and I still complain about it, won the Oscar, sure, Benicio was good, but if you see Phoenix and compare it to Benicio you will see my point, the role of Commodus was much more emotional, had more screen time, the character for me was better and I think played greatly. The rest of the cast is also wonderful, specially the late Oliver Reed, too bad we lost this great actor, he may had won the Oscar for this performance. And the soundtrack is another proof that Hans Zimmer is a genius. To sum up, buy Gladiator, is a great movie, and a great DVD, it has great sound, picture, and special features, a must have. 5 stars are not enough.
0395759242|5.0|As the end of the 19th century neared, Leopold II, King of Belgium, dreamed of being a competing world power.  This was particularly difficult for him to accomplish considering the size and resources of Belgium compared to those of the immense United States, and the British Empire.  Leopold was able to devise a plan utilizing colonization in order to establish his own empire.  His plan was to take over the Congo Basin of South Africa where European rule had not been implemented as of yet, and extract the resources from deep within the jungle.<BR> The key to conquering the Congo had nothing to do with manpower, money, or guns; it was all about creating a humanitarian faade in order to hide his true intentions.  Leopold was able to pull this off magnificently.  The world over praised him for his work in the Congo: eliminating slave trade; civilizing the indigenes; and doing it all without benefiting personally in terms of wealth.  The actualities of his rule included forced labor, cruelty, and plenty of revenue from stolen resources.  The picture he painted to the rest of the world was so elaborately false that it is truly a work of art.<BR> Without this faade Leopold II would not have been able to take over the Congo all by himself.  The wealth he amassed, and the amount to which he was praised and supported as a humanitarian shows the effectiveness of his propaganda.  To the eyes of the world Leopold II was overseeing the civilization of the Congo: bringing schools, churches, and railroads.  In reality he was controlling and exploiting the indigenes and the raw resources of the entire basin; the rubber industry set up by Leopold II encouraged slavery, torture, and a rape of the land.  Without that cloud he would have been opposed quicker and with more strength than when his actions were discovered.<BR> Hochschild compared the atrocities that occurred in the Congo rubber industry to those committed in the Nazi movement.  The cruelty was extensive.  Slaves were worked until their deaths. Law was harshly enforced (slaves were shot, mutilated, whipped to death, and otherwise abused).  Sentries employed by Leopold were accountable for each bullet they fired (bullets were only to be used in a useful manner i.e. killing a slave, usually a severed hand was required by an officer as proof to the kill).  These acts, along with raids, disease, and famine (brought on by Leopold's regime), accounted for the death of over 10 million indigenous people.<BR> The abuse implemented in his reign created efficiency through intimidation.  The amount of rubber resources an indigenous tribe was required to harvest was beyond their capability in normal circumstances.  They had to concentrate all their time to harvesting, and all their manpower, and this still didn't do the job.  The slashing of rubber vines ensued, which killed the vines, and this led to the diminishment of natural rubber in the Congo.  While they were out harvesting the rubber sap to fulfill their quotas, their women and children were being held hostage by sentries.  As a result, they were unable to spend any time upkeeping their villages, or tending their crops.  Their way of life was ruined through many mediums.<BR> This book documents a lot of this abuse regardless of the general lack of resources.  Most of the resources from Leopold's reign are written by the officers; there are extremely few cases in which Africans tell their tales and experiences.  Since it is the oppressors who are conveying the situation to the rest of the world, they are easily able to hide their actions.  It obviously does not last forever; eventually there are people, such as E. D. Morel, George Washington Williams, and Roger Casement, who go to the Congo and discover the reality.  E. D. Morel was able to hypothesize a slave industry while he was back in Europe when he saw Congo ships arrive and drop off rubber and ivory, then turn around and go back without bringing anything to pay for the cargo.  His claims were proved and eventually he and Casement started the first human rights movement of the 20th century.<BR> Hochschild tells us this tale introducing many influential people in both the creation of the slave-run Congo and the downfall of its oppressive walls.  Henry M. Stanley, Roger Casement, Joseph Conrad, E.D. Morel, Henry S Sanford, William Sheppard, and George Washington Williams are the main characters of the book.  They are followed throughout, and are always meeting, passing by, corresponding, dining, on retreat, or debating one another.  Hochschild did a magnificent job connecting these people to each other and uses their stories as a medium for transporting the facts of King Leopold's terror.  These people are such a big part of the book that after Hochschild has said all the information regarding the Congo, he finishes with the non-Congo related endings of all their lives.  This really provides a great closing and re-emphasizes Hochschild's opinion to the importance of these people's effect on the Congo.<BR> King Leopold's Ghost brings to life an event that has none of the recognition of the Nazi atrocities but all of the torture, cruelty, murder, and then some.  Throughout the book these normally graphic facts are dulled without losing the effect.  In contrast Hochschild stays away from the normal dry material of history books by documenting flavorful stories starring prominent figures of the Congo's creation and reform.  By weaving the adventures of the stars, he creates a well-researched historical telling of the tale Leopold II did not want you to hear.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I loved it, it is fantastic, Tom Hanks had a tough job in going against Russell Crowe, but lets face it, Hanks has already 2 awards, let's give the new guy a chance. But never mind, Cast Away is fantastic, again Robert Zemeckis surprises us with a great movie, it is very sad, but this is what makes it so great, never in my life had I ever felt like crying in a movie, not the bomb Titanic, or the spectacular Gladiator, neither Lion King or all the other sad films made it for me, but Cast Away, it sure hit me, Tom Hank's character Chuck Noland is very real and very well played, well let's face it, it was Tom Hanks, and he really gets you, you feel with him his happiness and his sadness. Two scenes specially got me, when he looses Wilson, some people say to me the crying over a ball is dumb, but watch the movie and you will see why is that so sad. And when he gets home and realises the he has lost Kelly (Helen Hunt which has a short but memorable role), the scene with the two of them in the rain and, well all the last 20 or 30 minutes are very emotional but very well acted, written and directed, plus the 7 minutes of music of Alan Silvestri, which is the only soundtrack the movie has, those 7 minutes are beautiful, just that was enough, the movie is so good it does not need a proper soundtrack. To be honest, I had never seen a movie like this, this movie sure is great, again 5 stars are not enough, this DVD, although the special features are not my type of features, the are still good. The sound is great, the picture even better. A must-have.
B00005U122|5.0|Bought it and saw it today.  What a wonderful compilation of Waters' genius.  The sound is fantastic in surround, and the visuals crisp and intimate.  The behind the scenes addition is nice if somewhat perfunctory.  Would have liked a little more insight into the band.  I'm a huge fan of Waters, but I think the casual Floyd fan will also find more than enough here to satisfy.  I love watching Doyle Bramhall and Snowy White duel their immaculate guitars!!  All-in-all a great visual/aural experience.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I'm not even going to try and pretend that I know exactly what was going on in this movie - or that I appreciated it on some artistic level of genious.  But I really have to say that I enjoyed it.  It was so strange and confusing, but I HAD to keep watching.  The best word to describe it is compelling.  I haven't been that engrossed in a movie in a while.  It's dark, it's confusing and it'll stick with you for a while after you see it.  But definitely worth it.
0553470485|5.0|An absolutely superb audio book that improves with each subsequent listening, CHarlotte's Web read by E.B. WHite has delighted my children and humored my husband and me for years! THe nuances a listener discovers from listening to Mr. WHite tell his story can't be beat. Another benefit, especially for readers of Junie B Jones and CAptain Underpants, is the perfect and beautiful use of the English language by E.B. WHite, the author of Elements of Style!
0689815816|4.0|A fun and interesting book.  I am not in love with it... but my kids like it quite a bit.  It is interesting because it takes children on a journey through woods, fields, swamps, etc. to go find a bear. All along the way, there are funny sounds to show the different obstacles on the journey... woods, fields, swamps, etc.  These sounds enhance the stimulation of the journey.  As the journey reverses itself, the story repeats the words, sounds, places and experiences for enhanced learning.<br />The pictures are good, but a little dull - but the kids still enjoy them.  And, the surprise ending is fun to rush through for more excitement.<br />Overall, a good book, fun and a little bit silly.
B00001ODHJ|4.0|I was greatly surprised by this third episode of the Evil Dead<BR>series.  It goes one more step further into the Raimi-comedy<BR>horror style.  To tell you the truth, I wasn't expecting much<BR>of that movie.  And that because Evil Dead II had reached the<BR>perfect level of gore/horror/comedy.  <br />I don't think Army of Darkness is better than Evil Dead II.  <BR>It is actually very different, and would be difficult to really<BR>compare.  Army of Darkness is really a FUN movie.  Gags all over<BR>the place and total laugh from A to Z.  Mister Ash is simply<BR>hilarious and funnier than ever, with the great sarcasm that<BR>has grown since Evil Dead II.  <br />I would only repproach that the &quot;gore&quot; side of it is a little<BR>too low (perhaps because Universal is involved, I don't know), <BR>and that the movie itself is too short, but aside of that, <BR>this movie really rocks and provides an action/adventure/comedy<BR>packed supply of entertainment.<br />Not everybody might like it though.  But I guess if you've come<BR>from Evil Dead I, then II, you've felt a comic transition.  <BR>Army of Darkness should be for you as well.  But don't expect<BR>it to be better than Evil Dead II!  It's just very different.<br />Not many many extras, but interesting stuff like the men behind<BR>the army (a making of kinda of thing).  That's the kind of thing<BR>that's always nice.  When I bought the first Evil Dead on DVD,<BR>I didn't get the special edition, so there was just the movie,<BR>period.  That's a lil short.  But here, you have at least some<BR>extras.  <br />Sound-wise, I can't really comment on the 5.1 because I don't<BR>have that equipment but even the stereo alone sounded really<BR>good.<br />I could talk about it for hours and tell about my favorite parts<BR>but that'd ruin the pleasure to discover it so go ahead...
B00005OWIU|5.0|Again John Williams delivers a great score to a wonderful film. The music from &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot; is an accurate companion to the story by J K Rowling in more ways than one. Much has already been said in previous reviews on the spendour and richness of the music, as well as it being well tuned to the intended audience: children.<br />However, there is even more to this soundtrack than that. Williams has always been a master in taking the musical idiom of classical composers and bringing it to people who are not so well introduced to 'real' classical music. His musical quotations are not literal: Williams mirrors the texture and orchestral sound to his own advantage.<br />This Harry Potter soundtrack is no exception. While listening I was constantly reminded of music by Tchaikowski ('The Sugar Plum Fairy Dance' from 'The Nutcracker') in the main theme; Strawinski ('Le Sacre du Printemps') in the 'Moving Stairs' sequence; and most of Holst's 'The Planets' suite throughout -- 'The Quidditch Match', 'The Chess Game' and even 'Christmas at Hogwarts' are arguably inspired by this classical opus.<br />Is this a bad thing? I think not: the Harry Potter soundtrack will be enjoyed by children (and adults) worldwide. With it's 'bite-size' length tracks, it can be a marvellous introduction to orchestral classics. If your children love this, I highly recommend taking their musical preferences further after this by encouraging them to listen to aforementioned music. Believe me, they will enjoy it!
B000002NJS|5.0|At this point in time, who needs to read my two cents about a 3 year old multi platinum recording? First of all, I am not a big fan of Madonna, I find her public persona too opportunisitc and crude (give me your money and I'll show you my private parts). But, all is forgotten whenever I listen to this magical recording. It is timeless, wise and kind. From the first seconds of Drowned World through the beautiful message of The Power of Goodbye, the listener is treated to an intelligent and breathtaking sound scape. The most beautiful thing about this album is that it is a complete coherent statement. It tells the story of the soul's journey and offers a place of sanctuary to the weary traveller. Madonna's experiences with yoga must have put her in touch with moments of the eternal truth. Thank you and take good care of your children, they are on loan from God.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|America doesn't respect musicals enough, otherwise people would be flocking to stores in order to get their hands on a copy of this great movie.  It has something in it for everyone:  Gorgeous song and dance numbers for the performers like myself, a beautiful love story for the romantics, and a barrage of well-timed comedy for those who need more entertainment than what the movie already provides.  The movie starts fast and is hard to catch onto at first, but the hyperactive dance scenes and speedy dialogue do nothing except make you want to glue your eyes to the television screen at all costs.  I highly suggest this movie to anyone who is bored of the same ol' mindless action films or predictable chick flicks.  It's one of the best movies of the year.
B00005QDW1|5.0|'Rock Steady' by No Doubt is suprising, each song has its rythm and sound. In despite of having some great tracks 'Return of Saturn' was a bit disappointed compared to the successful 'Tragic Kingdom',but with their latest album No Doubt achieved what it is the most difficult in the Music world: Carry on doing great albums without sounding like the previous.<BR>Obviously I will recommended to the fans but also to whom knows No Doubt by name. All No Doubt ingredients are present with some great extra such as the duo with The one who once was called Prince.  <BR>Great achievement and worth to have it.
B00001OH1S|4.0|Summary:<BR>It was a great movie and the CD is almost as good.  It was fast paced, great cinematography, and great music that matched the scenes.  The CD brings you back to the movie.  And, it stands on its own as a great listening CD.  <br />Outstanding songs include: (worth the CD) <BR> Sinnerman (Nina Simone)<BR> Everything (Wasis Diop)<BR> Caban La Ka Kratchie (Georges Fordant)<BR>The jazz is fresh, energetic, and exotic.<br />Negative:<BR>But, it gets only 4 stars because it is missing songs from the movie.  When you find you like the CD, you will have to get the movie and vice versa.  It is one of those rarities that everything fits together really well. (...)

0060931671|5.0|Pynchon does for the postmodern literature scene with &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; what Pink Floyd did to the music scene with &quot;The Wall.&quot;<br />However, I find it odd how the literati, in their esoteric little ramblings called criticism, are in favor (well, most of them anyway) of Pynchon's satire, when he satires the pomp of Western, educated society as to be so well off that we have begun to invent connections for conspiracy.<br />To recommend one Pynchon book over another would be a fallacy, for they are all important to the face of modern writing--if you can call what we do now writing.  <BR>&quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; is by far Pynchon's easiest book to read.  His satire and allusions are less obscure, in my opinion, in The Crying ... than they are in, say, &quot;Vineland.&quot;<br />I would advise, however, that if you are not knowledgeable in grammatical theory, history, social theory, chemical use or agreeing on the exact melancholy state of Modern Man and of the human condition in general with most of the writers from the late nineteenth century (those contemptuous luddites), that you do not read this book, most of the satire in this book will slide over your head; and you will find a novel full of disconnected ravings, comma splices, fragments and a general discombobulated literary sense.  <br />However, I'm sure you will find the characters interesting.<br />This book, I would like to add, can serve, as well as Kasey's, as an example of the new consiousness.
B00005LKIM|2.0|The score by Hans Zimmer was about the only aspect of this movie that kept it from one-star territory.  Zimmer's music is gorgeous and helps the movie as much as it can, which isn't enough.<br />As soon as I heard that Thomas Harris was writing a &quot;sequel,&quot; I balked.  You can't write a sequel that follows a book (and movie!) that good with the ending it had.  Lecter walks off down the street never to be heard from again.  Repeat:  never to be heard from again.  To bring him back, in print or in film, was a big mistake.  Let us just imagine what Lecter's life has been like these last ten years as we watch SILENCE again on a re-release or something. . . .  I know sequels are all the rage, and some even work.  LETHAL WEAPON?  Sure, make all you want--just change the criminals and their crimes.  MISSION IMPOSSIBLE?  Sure, just make sure the second one makes sense (which they did).  STAR TREK?  Sure, whatever, make a dozen (halfway there!).  AUSTIN POWERS?  That's close.  HOME ALONE?  Sure, I'll even buy that.<br />But great (or even really good) books, therefore movies, do not lend themselves well to sequels.  Or follow-ups.  Or whatever they want to call HANNIBAL.  You can follow up GONE WITH THE WIND with SCARLETT years later, but how many Pulitzers or Oscars are you going to win. . . ?  The ultimate blame lies with Thomas Harris, so maybe I should be reviewing the book (that's right, I boycotted it!).  I watched the movie primarily to hear Anthony Hopkins do Hannibal with different dialogue.  His voice isn't the same, though.  Nor is his character.  He is just silly rather than immaculately psychotic.  Clarice's character is way different--that's a draw (Jodie Foster made the smart choice).  Ridley Scott did what he could with the script, I'm sure, and some of the scenes in Florence are beautiful.  However the whole premise is entirely implausible, the action and dialogue are forced, and the ending is just plain foolish.  The dining room scene comes across as funny, which is not what Harris, Scott, or Hannibal, even, would have wanted.<br />My advice:  rent SILENCE OF THE LAMBS again, read that book if you haven't already, buy the soundtrack to HANNIBAL, and just listen to that; while listening, imagine where Hannibal and Clarice would be by now and make your own story--don't let Thomas Harris or Ridley Scott try to tell you.  You can't do any worse. . . .
B00005QDW1|1.0|Major MAJOR disappointment.  It's especially sad for those of you &quot;die hard&quot; no doubt fans.  I know I'd be crushed if my favorite band released an album that just flat out sucks.  The originality and creativity that made the band &quot;special&quot; is long gone.  This is merely a compilation of very weak electronic melodies with repetitive choruses that will have you grabbin for the CD player to chuck it out the window as fast as you possibly can.  I'd rather be listening to the ice cream truck driving up and down the block. Seems like the record company got a little too greedy aiming to make a dent in the &quot;kiddie pop&quot; market where they didn't need to be.   <br />I'm especially sad because I really liked this band and was anxiously looking forward to this next release.  Now I just feel as though another good band has been destroyed.  Too bad.  I hope when the smoke clears and No Doubt realizes what a big mistake this was, that they have the balls to confront the record company and set things straight.  Hopefully this won't be the death of No Doubt and the birth of No Doubt &quot;'Outta Sync&quot;!
B00003CXHJ|5.0|Review:<BR>Outstanding and gripping and action packed story, great script, great cinematography, fantastic performances (even by unknowns), fantastic sets, great Director's Commentary - Jonathan Mostow, (with additional cast and producer interviews), all star cast (see editors review above), great music... it just keeps going.  <br />If you want a good solid war movie full of heroes giving their lives for the greater cause, this is it!  And, if you are not a war movie fan.... it doesn't have the gruesome scenes that plague most war movies.<br />Story:<BR>Early in WWII the US lost 25% of its merchant marine fleet (cargo ships) right off the Atlantic Coast.  Nazi subs crushed the US efforts to support the European theater with war materials.  A Nazi sub is disabled and floating in the middle of the Atlantic and it becomes a race against time to get the sub and its &quot;enigma machine&quot; - the coding device used to send undecipherable messages.  Because of the allied shipping losses, the enigma machine is more valuable than the crew sent to collect it.  Matthew McConaughey, has to confront his own weaknesses as he becomes skipper of the disabled sub when his American sub is sunk, killing his skipper ( Bill Paxton) and its crew.  McConaughey is left with a handful of crew members, and a captured German crewman.<br />The story brings to life the reality and pain of decisions that must be made for the &quot;greater good&quot; during war, and unusual circumstances.<br />Really everything in the movie and the DVD was great, making this a very exceptional DVD movie.<br />Negatives:<BR>Absolutely none!  (Unless you don't like war movies).

B00005U2LM|5.0|First of all, I have been listening to a leaked copy of this album for about two weeks. At first I really didn't like it that much, but then after listening to it a few times it got a lot better. In my opinion this is the fourth great album that the Wu has done. First was Enter Ther Wu-Tang, their debut album with raw production and fresh lyrics. Next was Forever, the innovative double LP. After that came The W, the grossly underrated and unusual album. Now comes Iron Flag, the new album, with polished lyrics and great production similar to the old days with simpler loops. All four of Wu-Tang's albums have been totally different from each other and every other rap album out there.<br />Allright, now more about this album. Simply, it's great. Even though there were some disappointing sophmore solo efforts from Wu-Tang's members, Iron Flag is lyricly as good as any other Wu-Tang album, if not better. It seems like everybody has really got their stuff together. I guess I'll go through each member one by one and talk about their lyrics:<br />Method Man - Absolutlely spitting his best lyrics since Enter The Wu-Tang. Although he doesn't show up as much as I'd like, he rarely slows down when he gets on the mic. Best verses: &quot;Ya'll Been Warned&quot;<BR>------<BR>Ghostface Killah - Luckily the only member who talks about the Sept. 11th attacks more than once. Still, he does a good job even at that, and the rest of the album he continues to deliver the obsucre rhymes and great storytelling that make him unique. Best track: &quot;Babies&quot;<BR>------<BR>GZA - Not quite as good as he used to be I'd say, but he's running at 90%. Best Track: &quot;Back In The Game&quot;<BR>------<BR>U-God - Much better than he used to. Although he hits a few rough spots, he comes off with some great lyrics. Best track: &quot;Soul Power&quot;<BR>------<BR>RZA - RZA's lyrics are excellent on Iron Flag. Like on &quot;Chrome Wheels&quot;, he hits an incredibly nice line: &quot;Guns jammed up//I'm crammed up in my lab//&quot;. RZA at his best. Best Track: &quot;Chrome Wheels&quot;<BR>------<BR>Inspectah Deck - Deck is just as good as ever, and even on the 1 or 2 tracks with so-so beats, Deck makes them worth listening to. Best Track: &quot;Dashing (Reasons)&quot;<BR>------<BR>Masta Killah - I didn't used to like Masta Killah, but I have to admit, he's gotten better. Best track: &quot;In The Hood&quot;<BR>------<BR>Raekwon - It's kind of weird how he spits like only 4 bars on 2 songs, but on the songs where he does have longer verses, he delivers complicated and almost haunting verses. He sounds different then he used to, but his lyrics were more intricate too. Best Track: &quot;Iron Flag&quot;<BR>------<BR>And as for the Wu afilliates, they also make a strong showing. None of the second hand Wu members spat any bad verses. I was a little worried that they might ruin some tracks, but they added to them. On the other hand, there are a couple of annoying female vocals, like on &quot;Chrome Wheels&quot; and &quot;Babies&quot;.<br />Ok, now to talk about the songs. Here are the songs in order of best to worst:<br />1. [In The Hood] - Includes a superb intro and the most energetic beat of the whole album.<BR>------<BR>2. [Rules] - Great beat with some samples of old Wu albums mixed in for fun. A fun track to listen to with a damn nice hook by Meth.<BR>------<BR>3. [Ya'll Been Warned] - RZA and Meth tear it up. The hook is not as good as Meth can do but it's still a nice pair of bars. If I heard right this will be the second single (After Pinky Ring [Uzi])<br />------<BR>4. [Iron Flag] - Even with the great verse from Raekown, this isn't exactly the #4 song, but it's also got a semi-hidden song at the end called &quot;Good Thing We Brought The Glock&quot;. This hidden song is pretty funny and innovative with a crawling beat. <BR>------<BR>5. [Chrome Wheels] - Not exactly a parody of commerical rap like I thought it would be when I saw the track title, but it'sactually kind of a remiscent track about the old days before Wu-Tang and a high-school anthem of sorts.<br />------<BR>6. [Radioactive] - A great beat with some freaky stereo sound effects.<BR>------<BR>7. [Pinky Ring (Uzi)] - The first single to be released, featuring (I think) every non-incarcerated Wu member. Kind of like &quot;Triumph&quot; due to all the people on the track. A really addictive beat with lots of horns.<BR>------<BR>8. [Back In The Game] - A really great drum loop beat and a hook by Ron Isely. I honestly don't like the hook that much or else this song would be higher up on my list.<BR>------<BR>9. [Babies] - Not the best beat, but by far the best storytelling track on Iron Flag with Ghostface and Raekwon showing their skills.<BR>------<BR>10. [Soul Power] - An underrated song. Decent beat and the hook by Flava Flav. This might be one spot lower except U-God is at his best ever on this track. I really like his verses on Soul Power and I usually don't.<BR>------<BR>11. [One of These Days] - Good lyrics by Deck and others but I really didn't like the beat.<BR>------<BR>12. [Dashing] - I just didn't like the beat, but once again Deck's lyrics make it listenable.<br />Even the worst songs on the album are still good to listen to, which is more than you can say for most albums, even great ones. The quality is always high especially lyricly.<br />I have to admit, the production wasn't exactly on the same level as other Wu albums. I'd give the production 4 stars out of 5. But like I said, the lyrics are amazingly good, so that why I gave Iron Flag 5 stars.<br />Thsi album is not quite on the level of Enter The Wu-Tang, but it is definetly worth buying, and will become a true classic.
B00005U122|5.0|I agree with the previous reviews that the concert was excellent. And now that I've seen the disc, I have to say that they did an excellent job with the dvd. The whole show is there, as well as an extra 1/2 hour behind the scenes documentary. Neat menu's with sound clips like was done on The Wall disc. The 5.1 channel DD track sounds much better than the cd. Not only does it give the music a much fuller sound, but also is used to pan the sound effects around the room as was done at the concerts. <BR> Any fan of Pink Floyd should really enjoy this and if you aren't familiar with Roger Water's solo material, it should make you a fan of it, as well.
B00003CXSP|2.0|Review:<BR>How you like this movie depends on whether you read the book, whether you like gruesome scenes, and whether you appreciate sequels. This is an well done movie that has a few very gruesome scenes and an ending that differs from the book. <br />The script is well written, Anthony Hopkins is, of course, very good in his role, (but, you have to get past the cheesy voice overs that are supposed to be from &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;) and Julianne Moore plays an excellent Agent Clarice Starling (a tough act to follow after Jodie Foster's role). Director Ridley Scott makes another great movie (Gladiator was similarly excellent while being gruesome, but not quite as gross as this). <br />The photography is stunning (except the grossly gruesome disgusting scenes). The locations are beautiful. The music is excellent. The editing is wonderful. The deeper uses of symbolism is intriguing and challenging, Etc. Etc. Etc. There really are some many technically and artistically great things about this movie; but in the end (literally) it becomes exceptionally gruesome, with a extraordinarily odious and contemptible final scene.<br />The movie IS Recommended if:<BR>You like an intense drama with gruesome scenes.<br />The movie IS NOT Recommended if:<BR>You are sensitive, or can be offended by the several scenes that go too far.
B000002H38|5.0|Quite simply,... this is the greatest album of all time.<BR>If you do not own this CD then you should be arrested. I am currently campaigning with the British Government to have a law passed to make it mandatory to own this album once a person reaches age 16.<BR>It's uplifting, soaring, atmospheric, sensual and timeless.<BR>Buy it immediately, put it on a pedestal and improve your quality of life.<BR>Nothing has come near this in 15 years - awesome - essential....untouchable.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|I was really anticipating listening to this CD when I ordered it.  I love Christina's voice and I thought that this would be a great addition to my Christmas collection.  It fell short of my expectations.  She sings traditional Christmas music but it almost feels \\"choppy\\".  She adds extra \\"la, la, la\\" sounds throughout, which wouldn't be that bad, but it feels like an interruption to the music.  She also adds a lot to the lyrics.  For example, during \\"O Holy Night\\", she recites the Lord's Prayer.  I did not care for such additions to the music.  It is her interpretation of the songs and I guess I just did not care for that interpretation.

B000002UB3|5.0|I always thought this album stood well by itself, so I never bothered to write a review.  But after reading someone's comments about The Beatles being nothing more than &quot;yeah yeah yeahs&quot; and &quot;hype&quot; I felt compelled to include my thoughts.  Anyone, I don't care how old or young, what your preference in music is, where you come from, whatever...who doesn't think the Beatles changed music forever or influenced virtually all rock music is..quite simply..ignorant.  Luckily for those that appreciate the band, any bad commentary will continue to just make us laugh.  Abbey Road is a beautiful ending to an amazing career of growth.  Granted, I'm not a big fan of &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; either, but hey, no band is capable of writing nothing but superb songs. And to close with our little friend's analogy, if aliens did land after there were no life left on earth and the only thing they could find was a copy of Abbey Road, I can't think of a better legacy to leave them.  One last thing, the Beatles always sang of love...something that is disappearing these days..unless you can put up with Celine Dion.
B00005QG9K|1.0|I am a hardcore Incubus Fan and I hate this CD. After hearing S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself you'll use this CD for a Beverage Coaster. The Lyrics and music of Morning View seem thrown together without much thought. I give This Album A -1 out of 5. They really let me down with this one. Otherwise one of my favorite bands.
0743216458|5.0|Once again, Stephen Ambrose has gone to great lengths to bring a piece of history to his readers.<br />In &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, Ambrose carefully re-constructs the war from the viewpoint of the soldiers who were there, to include their horrors, fears, and thrills.  By searching for, and locating, survivors from this unit and getting their personal accounts of the events, Mr. Ambrose has come through with a work that literally puts you in the middle of the action.<br />I tip my hat to Mr. Ambrose, his work, and the honor that he gives the men who served.  I tip this not only as an author, but also as one who served many years in the uniform.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I found No Doubt's &quot;Rock Steady&quot; to be really enjoyable! It has a bit of a reggae sound to it. Every song is fresh and will have you singing along in no time! I like the electronica it offers.
B00005QZWI|4.0|I picked this up because I love Shore's work for David Cronenberg, such as Videodrome and Dead Ringers. This is by far the most epic and classically inspired score he's done. Not as experimental as Crash or even his music for the Cell but majestic and inspiring. I don't get the knee jerk &quot;its like John Williams&quot; critique, but a touch of Wagner never hurt anyone. However if you want the best of Shore find the elusive &quot;Music for the Films of David Cronenberg&quot; cd.
B00005QG9J|1.0|If your just getting in to Incubus buy Science and Make Yourself. I have been a hardcore Incubus Fan for 5 years, have seen them in concert 4 times and have all their albums and I can honestly say this is their worst album next to fungus amongus. If you watch TRL then you would probably like this album. Too bad you dont know what good music is.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|I am a big A-HA fan and believe that Morten Harket has one of the best voices around. This album is very touching and certainly great. Morten's voice appears a little different than what we are used too. There are many great songs that I really like. &quot;Minor earth major sky&quot;, &quot;Velvet&quot;,&quot;The Sun Never Shone That Day&quot;,and &quot;Summer Moved On&quot;,which uses a symphony orchestra in the background that sounds magnificant as it follows Morten's voice. Dont let me forget my favorates like &quot;Thought That It Was You&quot;, &quot;I Wish I Cared&quot;, &quot;You'll Never Get Over Me&quot; that will leave you breathless. Most of the songs sound similar in style. Most songs are sad and on the relaxing side. Nevertheless, this is one of their most mature and complete albums and I certainly have to say that it is ten times better than &quot;Memorial Beach&quot;. I am just glad to see the three of them still togather, making beautiful music like always. A definite must buy for all A-HA fans.
059035342X|5.0|The Hype is true.  Harry Potter is a story worth reading.  Before I started to read this book, I was very unsure and skeptical about the Harry Potter phenomenon.  It seemed like a book that only a young child could like and that it was below my reading level.  Once I started reading it, however, I discovered how wrong I had been.  This book is not just for a young child who has a large imagination.  This book can and should be read by people of all ages because everyone would enjoy this book regardless of age.  The plot of this book follows a normal hero's journey, which is not so complicated that a child couldn't understand and enjoy it.  It also isn't so simple that an adult would think the book was too childish.  It finds a happy median so that everyone can enjoy it.  Rowling does an excellent job of characterization and by the end of the book, you feel like you really know the characters and how they will react to certain problems that arise.  Hagrid (one of Harry's friends that he meets) comes across as an intimidating man that is very strong and dangerous.  Rowling, through her excellent use of description and words, makes Hagrid act and sound like a very timid, passive person who wouldn't hurt anyone.  This book stirs the creative mind in all of us.  It allows the reader to live through the eyes of an eleven-year-old wizard who has an important destiny to fill.  I feel that this book is worth reading, and I also look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00005K3O4|4.0|This is very campy. I don't know if it's supposed to be funny or serious, but it's funny. The scariest clowns I've ever seen. This will give small kids nightmares. But adults will laugh. It's worth the price. You'll have fun with this one. Just don't take it seriously. You'll never look at clowns the same way again.
0385486804|5.0|i really enjoyed this story. after having rea both into thin ai and into th wild i have really gained an appreciation for krakauers writing. i was really interested in chris mccandless, although i found his obsession with the transcendental beliefs a little out there. this could have been my favorite book if my high shcool english teaher (v. lojko) hadnt ruined it wih stupid assignments. for all teachers out there, dont treat this book like a classic work of fiction. dont make kids compare it to guys like thoreau or emerson. the only way to enjoy it is to read for your own enjoyment
B00005R87Q|4.0|I found this movie extremely enjoyable and would recomend buying it. I would, however, warn you that this is a guy movie. if you are not a guy you might not like it. Some other reviewers didnt seem to like it very much. they claim that beyond hot girls, action and fast cars, this movie has little appeal. These critics fail to consider the purpose of an action movie- to entertain the masses.(thus the hot girls, fast cars and of course action) Perhaps  if this movie were a drama then you could rip it for lack of good scripting or whatever else. Fast and the Furious does what it has to do it - entertains the action/adventure connoseiurs, just like Arnold, bruce willis or any of the other greats  does. To compare this movie to a drama or an academy award winner is to compare a lexus to a supra ---they're for difffrent crowds. This becomes blatantly obvious as we see by the two kinds of reviews it gets - either great  or terrible. so if ure a guy who likes guy movies, buy it, if you are not, buy Marry Poppins with your hard earned dollars and ponder the britsh approach to industrialization. Meanwhile we'll be on the edge of our seats while the '69 charger cooks rice as the sun sets on another good 'ol american style action movie.
B00001NFCY|1.0|Creed's debut album &quot;My Own Prison&quot; was a good album that even some metalheads could get into, it had heart, emotion, and an appeal that could not be explained.  &quot;Human Clay&quot; however, has none of those redeeming factors and instead sound like a repetitive, made for radio, pop-rock that is as disposable as N*SYNC or Britney Spears.  &quot;My Own Prison&quot; had a dark edge that made it good, &quot;Human Clay&quot; is nothing but rehashed songs.  Every song starts off slow and builds to a fast pace, EVERY song, and the lyrics about how everyone should love each other can make you want to vomit.  Some songs are just plain annoying, especially &quot;What If&quot;, the chorus is so annoying and nauseating at times it makes me sick listening to it, and if I ever hear &quot;Higher&quot; or &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; again, which are two of the most self-indulged songs ever written, I'll be sick to my stomach.  And now wtth their new album out &quot;Weathered&quot;, it's even more of the same, and by this time in a month, Creed will be bigger than ever.  By the way, this isn't hard rock, this is pop dressed up like rock with no real edge or emotion.  It's disappointing because Creed could have been a great band, and the fact that this sold 10 million copies makes me wonder if people's brains are functioning correctly.
B00005JKES|5.0|I'm happy as a small cat in hell that they finally released this on DVD.  I've been waiting for what seems like forever. This is 100 percent better than the VHS box set in quality. I can't believe someone suggested to burn your VHS tapes onto DVD. The point of DVD is the QUALITY. That is enough reason right there to buy this set. (...) There's no reason to get upset with Artisan about (the missing pilot episode). They tried to get the rights to it but Warner Bros. wouldn't sell. Which means, they probably have their own plans for it in the future. Now all we need is Season TWO and FIRE WALK WITH ME!!!  I'm not kidding here, this is the best TV series ever made. I strongly urge you to stop reading these reviews and get these DVD's!!! You will be happy you did!
B00004T37H|3.0|The first time I saw this film, I was pretty much blown away.  I had to see it again, and although the second time wasn't quite as impressive, I never am quite as interested by the second viewing.  This movie was rated action but it might easily be in any genre; for instance, there was a romance element, the level of plot was more than par for a typical drama, and it might even double as a resource for understanding Shinto and Taoist religions.     <BR>     The main character is the an inhabitant of a small northern Japanese town, who gets bitten by a demon.  As he is one of the few remaining young males and likely of nobility in the town, it is imperative for him to be cured.  The local sages tell him that he needs to seek out a nature spirit, but he soon finds out that a town near the spirit's dwelling is slowly being deforestated to extract iron.  This is a tale of his struggle not only to preserve natural balance, but also a struggle with his inner being, as the same infection that gives him power to stop his enemies also eats away at him a little more with each use.  I gave it three three stars because I've usually found that if I get my expectations too high, it spoils the movie.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|Slipknot is a mix of many various music styles.  They sound awesome on cd as well as live!  I suggest you buy this cd, listen to all the songs (have a good atitude) and you will fall into the liking of Slipknot...If you like bands like Mudvayne, S.O.A.D., etc...this is the perfect band for ya!  Try going to their concerts, they are... fun!  All of their songs are original, Corey can sing, Joey is... killer at drumming!!!  Their beats are outstanding, since they have 2 other part drumers!  If you just let the beats flow, you will be able to understand everything, and it will go smooth.  This type of music if probably for people who dislike bsb(pop bands) and (country)garth brooks blah...This music is for the people who can't stand most sloooooow music.  It's full of crazy... sounds!!!  Buy the cd, and listen to all the songs!  Please don't diss on slipknot, they have more talent than you think!  Be respectful to all music!!!
B000007S5B|4.0|Since their debut, the Doors' leadsinger, Jim Morrison, had been teetering between the role of charismatic heart-throb and that of psychedelic wizard. On the band's third album, 1968's Waiting for the Sun, Morrison wanted to seriously flex his muscles as a dark poet with \\"the Lizard King,\\" a sprawling epic from the band's live set, meant to take-up the album's entire second side. Conflict with Electra Records and Morrison's bandmates squashed the idea (a small section of the piece still made it on the LP in the form of \\"Not to Touch the Earth,\\"). Even without \\"the Lizard King,\\" Waiting for the Sun is the landmark by which the seething, shaman side of Morrison takes a significant lead. With the exception of the pop-rockers, \\"Hello, I Love You,\\" the album spirals through bloody, Vietnam-era shrieking (\\"The Unknown Soldier\\" \\"Five to One\\") and earthy mysticism (\\"Spanish Caravan,\\" \\"Yes, the River Knows,\\" \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\"). It is a welcome alteration and Waiting for the Sun is the band's most consistent album yet because of it. On past efforts, Morrison's confidence and charisma were charming on radio-friendly poptunes such as \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"Love Me Two Times,\\" but they became truly captivating on his frothy, hard rockers such as \\"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\\" and \\"Backdoor Man.\\" On Waiting for the Sun Morrison lets that power fully surge for thirty delightful minutes.
B000050XEI|5.0|I have bought a total of 12 copies of this CD for gifts this Holiday season.  No BS.  I can listen to this CD over and over again, and I've had a really hard time getting it back from those that borrow it.  I'm a little dissapointed that Isobella isn't on this CD, but I'll get over it.  Buy this CD.
0312119038|5.0|If you have read any of Karen Armstrong's writings, you must read this book.  It reveals her personal history as a nun and how that experience has led to various spiritual leanings.  I have heard her speak in person several times, and I strongly encourage both the devoutly religious and non-religious alike to read her books and look for opportunities to hear her speak.
0385335482|4.0|As a student and a worker I know first hand what living in debt is like... frightening yet somehow forgettable. As long as the bills get thrown out, misplaced, or incinerated, they magically never existed at all. I cannot say that I have ever been guilty of committing such acts of irresponsibility, but that's not to say I haven't been tempted (try every time the post comes). This is a book to give hope to all of us dreaming of winning the lottery, discovering a rich aunt we never knew existed has left us fortune, or marrying an extremely wealthy (and Brad Pittish) fellow who will take care of any debt I have accumulated plus buy me that brand new Jetta I've had my eye on. Sigh. Anyway, I've read the thing twice now simply for the main character's silly attempts to avoid her debtors. Truly unbelievable. And though the ending may seem a little implausible, isn't that the point of a daydream?
B00005JKES|4.0|Okay, after waiting the two extra weeks for the release, from what I understand it was due to high demand, I faithfully went out and bought the DVD set today(Dec 18th) and boy my import DVD of the pilot really looks shoddy now in comparison to the brilliant transfers of the original series and the DTS sound and the packaging of this box set is very sweet. It DOES look and sound better than when it origianlly aired 11 years ago and broke the ground for such shows as The X Files Northern Exposure and American Gothic. If you are a Twin Peaks fan do not deny yourself. Make it a Xmas present for yourself. The extras do leave a little to be desired, but it has been said the extras on subsequent releases (and the more the first season sells the sooner we get the second season which may be in two separate sets) the extras are going to be even phatter. I have only watched the first disc so far (eps 1 and 2)and the extras (on disc 4) and I was blown away. The deep textures and feel of the show is beautifully maintained and looks fantastic and Angelo's score really stands out revealing the genius he is in his own right. I would recommend buying the import DVD and there are many to be had on Ebay (mainly because it looks better than my 11 year old copy of the original airing or any previous VHS release) even if the sound quality is a bit distorted at times, just because we may never get the pilot on DVD. There are no deleted scenes but there are script notes in the chapter selections for each ep which describe with text altered dialogue and deleted scenes giving fans a real inside look at the development of the series. The commentary is intersting and I personally like that they added the &quot;previously on Twin Peaks&quot; intros to each show like when it aired on TV. The one bright spot of the extras is the &quot;Twin Peaks Directory&quot; that starts with Laura Palmer where fans can get lost in the different characters and their various relationships to each other includingbios and filmographies and in some cases &quot;Video Postcards&quot; which are excerpts of interviews ranging from how they got involved with the show or glimpses of their home life etc. Like Richard Beymer's psychedelic trip down the Amazon and Al Strobel's poignant story of the accident(when he was 17) which cost him his arm. It is a true delight for fans. And the extra an &quot;Introduction to David Lynch&quot; gives an insightful journey through vatious interviews on what it's like to work with him and work on the show. I can't say enough about how good these shows look. I kept saying &quot;This looks fantastic&quot; and &quot;There is no other show like this nor will there ever be again.&quot; It dared the television audience to use their minds and get lost in the characters and their intertwining relationships to the point where you didn't care who killed Laura Palmer because there was so much more to dive into besides the main arc of the series. Don't hesitate. Go buy it now, because I want the second season to come out ASAP. I would give five stars but I adamantly agree Artisan should have went the extra mile to get the pilot. And in closing, something I noticed. The Republic Pictures emblem is on this DVD set. Well, guess what? It's on the import DVD of the pilot as well, so what's the problem? I'm guessing it had something to do with the European release of the pilot with the alternate ending but who knows for sure I don't even thinks Artisan does. Dust off that recipe for cherry pie, put on some coffee and invite your friends over for a Twin Peaks party, especially those who haven't seen it before (costume optional).
B000002UAF|5.0|It's easy to like the Beatles after all these years and I am particulary enjoying my re-discovery of them in my middle years. <BR>A Hard days night is pure pop magic from start to finish.  When I put this CD in play,  I immediately TURN UP THE VOLUME just to hear that famous opening cord for the title song and then the foot-tappin and in the car-karoaeke begins.<br />The next song I Should Have Known Better is another sing along favorite...whoa whoa I should known better with a girl like you...then John's harmonica hits at the right moment.<br />If I Fell &amp; I Love Her are among the best early Beatles ballads and I especially enjoy seeing them performed on the MOVIE soundtrack.<br />I'm Happy Just to Dance With You, a Harrison song is cute, but he had not yet come into his peak.<br />Can't Buy Me Love is of the same energy as A HARD DAY's NIGHT.  Even my teenage daughter loves this one.<br />I am an unabashed fan although I don't like everything they have done as group or as individuals.  But, good music lasts and holds up.  The Beatles were a pretty good group after all.

B00005U122|5.0|For the price it is a steal. I had mine pre-ordered at Suncoast Films/Video. It captures the tour perfectly. The documentary is very interesting as it shows them messing around with different Pink Floyd songs to use in the tour. The DVD is the concert in Oregon. Definitely brought back my memories of the concert I seen at Star Lake Ampitheatre in Pittsburgh. I highly recommend this DVD to all Floydians and Waters fans. PEACE!!

B00004Z4WR|4.0|Ok then. Let's just get a few things straight first of all.<BR>1: This is not going to sweep the oscars.<BR>2: This will not wow audiences with its phenominal script.<BR> Do you know why that is?... It's because this wasn't made for that! It's not that type of movie. This is an all out fun movie (or as some of us like to call them &quot;popcorn movies!&quot;)<BR> So, heres my advise. You buy this movie, slap it in, turn the lights out, sit back, relax, turn up your dolby surround sound system and just enjoy it!<BR> I just wish that critcs would stop jugding these movies for something they'r not! They'r not all going to have great acting and scripts. So long as they excite and entertain the audience WHO CARES!? I don't think that there was much wrong with the acting in this, yeah some of the script was a bit cheesy but it's all part of the fun!<BR> Hope you all enjoy it!
B00005RFQ5|2.0|Music and religion were never meant to be used as weapons.  This is a terribly biased and narrow-minded example of religious propaganda.  Women are degraded, European-Americans are dismissed and the Jewish religion is insulted, I was appalled.  I have always enjoyed the undenialble musical talent of Prince, but I cannot tolerate the &quot;sell,sell,sell&quot; of a particular &quot;religious&quot; point of view. The word &quot;accurate&quot; is used more than once in relation to his religious &quot;opinion&quot;.  If you can get beyond the offensive messages, the music is wonderful .
B000002UA0|5.0|This is, quite simply, one of the best albums of all time and it is certainly my personal favourite. There were many great albums released in 1967, \\"something else\\" by the kinks and \\"sell out\\" by the who are favourites of mine, but none of them matched the charm of \\"Piper\\", with its exquisite combination of squalling feedback howls, exciting free-jazz freak-out, bouncing rhythms, magical lyrics and joyful songs that almost leap off the record but are balanced against dark swirling soudscapes, unhinged yelps and nonsensical chatter as well as the fluctuating pitch of the singing, which adds a melancholy, ironic englishness to the music. I have quite varied musical tastes(from Buddy Holly to Frank Zappa to the Manic Street Preachers) but for me this album incorporates everything I like about music into one delightful psychedelic mess. The free-jazz improvisations are just sensational. I love jazz and I love it even more when it's played with electric guitars at the highest possible volume that technology will allow. Syd's eccentric acid-pop songs are totally fresh and original and there isn't really anything quite like them anywhere else in music. The music also contains some of the evocative sounscapes of classical, but without any of the pretensiousness or over-bearing self-seriousness. During their time at the UFO club in London,where they developed their spacey psychedelic rock into such an unparalleled musical force, the Floyd became the ultimate freak-out act, using every trick they could think of, including sheer, paint-stripping volume, to make their music have more effect on the mind of the listeners. With Syd Barrett as their charismatic leader, they had a one in a million talent, whose guitar playing(once described as \\"a revolutionary source of electronic racket\\") was as original and unpredictable as his song writing. The debut album captures the spirit of the band even if it doesn't quite capture their live act at the time(how I wish Joe Boyd had producedit). \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\"(even the name is enchanting) begins with a creepy intro into the stinging slide guitar, echoing riff and trippy vocals of \\"Astronomy Domine\\", one of the coolest space jams of all time. This leads into the menacing riff and bass pattern of \\"Lucifer Sam\\". The unsettling organ refrain that jumps around in the background and the way that Syd spits out the lyrics, while playing the screeching riff on his telecaster over the top of the lilting bass line make this a frightening track to listen to at full volume in the dark. The next track is the organ-laced and beautiful but insane \\"Matilda Mother\\", with the weird backing vocals and overtures in the lyrics giving the song a disturbing edge. \\"Flaming\\" has some magical kaleidascope lyrics and dazzling guitar strumming (although the end always brings up mental images of a very red-eyed Roger Waters tinkling a small musical triangle). The next three tracks, \\"Pow. R Toc. H\\", \\"Take up thy Stethascope and Walk\\" and \\"Interstellar overdrive\\", are stunning in their crazed freak-out sections. The dervish yelps and chants of incomprehensible gobbledegook fit in to the music with uncanny timing, only adding to the energy and verve of the album. \\"The Gnome\\" has the strangest lyrics of them all but it isn't too unlikely that the tale of \\"a gnome named grimble gromble\\" is a metaphor for an acid trip. \\"Chapter 24\\" is the least accessable track on the album, with a recitation over chilling organ atmospherics. \\"Scarecrow\\" is another amusing character sketch, that was the B-side of \\"See Emily Play\\" but unlike \\"Candy and a Currant Bun\\" it was included on the album. Finishing the delightful journey through the psychedelic mists of \\"Piper\\" is \\"Bike\\", a fabulous torrent of almost unbearably melodious singing and wonderful, childish imagery. Syd is a genius and Pink Floyd's daring instrumental adventures helped him to create my idea of a perfect album. \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is a fantastic, colourfulalbum. It amazes at every new note and every new listen. Surprises at every corner with avant-garde brilliance, delightful melodies and absorbing musical textures. It may be difficult to understand to begin with(I listened to it literally hundreds of times before I really grasped its magic) but it remains and always will remain a charming psychedelic masterpiece and a lyrical wonderland.
B00003CXCS|1.0|I was so excited to get the 5 star collection of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.  When I did, I popped it in expecting that warm feeling but instead I found it cold and vaguely creepy.  In the opening scenes, showing the Austrian hills, the scenes look so fake and cartoonish...like a video game.  These scenes were actually filmed on location to get the true feeling of being there.  Now, they look computer generated--in fact, I can tell some differences that have been thrown in to make everything look even more glistening.  It isn't higher resolution, it's fake stuff.  The warm feeling of film is gone and is replaced with harsh sound and even the faces of the characters look plastic, like robots.  This is a movie best seen on VHS in Widescreen format.  If they digitalized it anymore, it would look like &quot;The Matrix&quot;...it almost does.  I love the DVD format for most movies but this one overdoes it bigtime.  It looks like a cartoon or video game.
B00005K3NR|5.0|&quot;Carrie&quot; was the first Stephen King book I read &amp; it got me hooked on him.  Often, movies vary so much from the books that they are hardly recognizable.  But this movie was true to the book &amp; Sissy Spacek was amazing!

B00004XQ83|5.0|The Coen brothers with their splendid (and hilarious) movie &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; have created a resurgence in the popularity of old timey/bluegrass music which is unprecedented. The album went Top 10 on the pop charts. It was the CMA's Album of the Year. It has focused the spotlight on artists like Ralph Stanley. For that alone, Joel and Ethan Coen have earned my eternal gratitude. Several of my friends have told me how much they've loved this album. I've encouraged them to consider artists like the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Dixie Hummingbirds, Robert Johnson or Mississippi John Hurt, among others. But even if they stop with this collection, this is powerful music from veterans like the Fairfield Four and Ralph Stanley along with artists like Norman Blake, Emmylou Harris and Alison Kraus. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00005PJ8I|1.0|I wanted to like this movie.  Really I did.  It had so much potential.  But it was long, boring, and completely unbelieveable.  Usually whether or not a movie is believeable doesn't matter to me.  But this one just appalled me so much that it was disgusting.<br />The movie started out well... but once the plane crashes and Tom Hanks ends up on the island... well, that's where it all goes downhill.  Why?  Because it's the most boring thing ever to be put on screen.  There isn't even any music to keep you going.  It's just Tom Hanks on an island.  Where's the entertainment in that?<br />My other big problem with this film is in the ending, and I think I'll refrain from discussing that here, just in case someone reads this and still wants to see the movie.  I don't like to ruin movies for people--even if they're bad movies.<br />I do agree that Tom Hanks did a good job with this movie.  It's the movie itself that was bad.
B00000I4XR|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It basically tells the true story of the 1916 shark attacks in NJ.  I highly recommend seeing this movie, even though the shark is a little phony, it is great for those interested in sharks
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I absolutely love the idea of owning a CD where Ewan McGregor sings.  I love his voice.  He's that much more attractive now that he can sing, too.  But this CD has more than just Ewan singing.  It's a great soundtrack!  Some of the songs get a little tiring... but it's not bad if you don't listen to the CD every day.<br />Any Rufus Wainwright fans out there?  He's got a song on this soundtrack, and it's absolutey beautiful.  I love Rufus.<br />There are some songs that I really wanted on this CD... especially the scene in the elephant where they're describing the play.  That song is hilarious!  Also, Like a Virgin.  Maybe the people putting the CD together decided that those were songs that really required the visual accompaniment.<br />Well, even without those songs, this CD is wonderful.
0790731002|2.0|This was bad it wasn't the tim burton style. this movie wasn't dark, He did not have a partner in 1,2, the batmobile didn't change, now look he has a different face what happened to Michael Keaton.I'm telling you Val kilmer doesn't suit batman Michael Keaton suits it. And one thing they are trying to make batman a sex symbol for batman forever and batman and robin he is not. Joel Schmacher the director of this and batman and robin he is not creative like tim burton. some parts in this film were ok but other parts were bad. Joel Schmacher did a terrible job for this and batman and robin. Batman forever and Batman and robin are not connected to batman and batman returns.<BR>This movie wouldn't be good in your collection.
B00005JKT8|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. At first I thought it would be kind of cheesy and maybe lame but I was wrong. It was so increibly cute and sweet. I guess you could say that it's kind of a chick flick even though i hate that saying. But nevertheless, guys, listen up cuz you could learn a lot from it. Hugh Jackman is so amazing in this movie that it makes you think he's perfect which he undoubtably is. I assure you that every woman who comes out of the theatre, or at least a damn good portion of them, will be totally smitten with this guy and will be wondering just exactly where he's been all these years. He is a great actor with the most beautiful voice. Now for Meg Ryan. She does a damn good job herself... course that's what she's used to. But nevertheless, she pulls it off. The two have great chemistry onscreen. Well don't know whatelse to say except that I really hope you don't miss this because it was the best and I don't think anyone else but Hugh Jackman, could've pulled such an awesome performance.

B00005NWRS|5.0|You often hear that someone is the newest hottest artist only to be let down with all the hype and nothing to back it up, but after the first listen to Ryan Adams GOLD, I was hooked. I heard some influence of Neil Young, Dylan and the Band and was caught up in the soulful lyrics. Can't wait to see this cat in person!
0812550757|1.0|Despite what people are saying, this book really isn't that great.  I mean it is okay, but don't read it if you expect something like Ender's Game.  Some of it is very good and interesting, but the book is boring sometimes.  It is worth reading if you really want to read it.  Go to the library and check it out.  If you did happen to read this book, whether or not you liked it, I don't suggest reading Zenocide.  I am waiting to get Children of the Mind, so I can't say anything about it.
B00005JKES|5.0|(...) My review: 1.  DVD is mastered beautifully.  100% better than the VHS boxed set.  Crisp, clear, no ghosts. 2.  Sound track is exceptional.  Better than I remeber it! 3.  Additonal features like the director commentary is *VERY* worthwhile.  I watched each epesode twice -- once again with the commentary.  (...)
B00005QIPH|4.0|This is great stuff - VU, but catchier with stronger structure.  Besides, VU is one of the most overrated bands in history.  Every rock afficianado feels obligated to drool all over them lest they be cast out.  Anyway, I actually like the fact that the Strokes wear their influences on their sleeve(s).  Its fun, its jumpin', its minimalist.  If you own any Stooges album and Rubber Soul, you WILL like this album.
068485015X|5.0|In order for this review to be helpful for you I'll assume that you haven't read the book and debating whether it's going to be worth your money and while.<br />I have just finished reading this book, and at once I logged on Amazon.com and bought a bunch of the author's other books! I also bought this same book as gifts for friends and relatives! This is how much I liked the author's mind and style and how much I appreciate his work in this book.<br />This book falls under the &quot;Popular Psychology&quot; category. It's written in a very simple language and a very attractive approach. The author has some very revolutionary visions about the human psyche and mind, but he doesn't shock you with them immediately. Instead, he starts with very commonly accepted beliefs and takes you on a very smooth journey that is full with knowledge and often surprises!<br />I believe that the book is a must read for everybody. However the last chapter, titled &quot;Grace&quot;, might be quite controversial to many. The pace in that last chapter takes a faster approach and some readers might find themselves disagreeing with the author's approach.<br />Nonetheless, the book is very valuable and it will definately change the way you perceive life and humanity overall!<br />In summary, I think that this book is worth your money and while.
B00003CXXS|4.0|Although JPIII is not as good as JP in terms of originality and plot, I thought it's better than JPII. I like the part when they are at the bridge inside the &quot;bird cage&quot;. So foggy and misty, and it reminded me of the PlayStation game &quot;Silent Hill.&quot; ;-)<br />** The following paragraph contains spoilers! **<BR>There are some parts of the movie that make me puzzled. For examples, the movie never explains who attacks the speed boat at the beginning of the movie, and also doesn't justify why those flying dinosaurs (why is their name?) don't attack the helicopters at the end of the movie when they are leaving the island. Anyway, no big deal. :-P<br />Both the video and audio qualities on this DVD are top-notch, The supplemental special features are also plentiful, although I was expecting more informative and entertaining materials to be included. Overall, if you're a JP fan, you would want to include this in your DVD collection. :-)
0312243022|5.0|I first read this book some years ago, and I hadn't read &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; by that time. Now, after reading Virginia Woolf's masterpiece, it was much more pleasant to read &quot;The Hours&quot;. Cunningham does not only make a homage to Mrs Dalloway, but also a reverence to Mrs Woolf and her unique style.<br />The book follows one single day in the lives of three different women living in different times and places. At first we are introduced to Virginia Woolf herself, who is an artist creating her most daring work. She is still at the begining of her novel, so we can see her development process. The second women who steps into this book is Clarissa -- a.k.a. Mrs Dalloway, named after the character by her friend and ex-lover Richard. She is a gay editor who is organising a party for Richard. The last one we meet is Laura Brown, who has just started reading &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; and wants to make a cake to celbrate her husband's birthday.<br />Page after page, these women got changed. Unexpected things crop up all the time. It's someone Clarissa meets at the park; it's Virginia's sister arriving earlier for a tea; it's Laura's neighbour asking her to look after a dog. Simple things that make them take small decisions, but decisions anyway.<br />As the book focus on one single day in these women's lives, not very big events happen all the time. The charm and appeal in Cunningham's writing are the daily situations. Ordinary things that everybody does are charmly discribed. Buying flowers is much more than this single act, it's wondering about how Clarissa could have been a closer friend to the shop keep; the result of Laura's cake may reflect her vision of her life -- although it's very nice, it's not really the way she wanted it to be--; Virginia changes her mind all the time about what she should do to her character-- does Clarrissa Dalloway kill herself? has she got a lost love?<br />The supporting characters step in and out of the book all the time, but they always leave some footsteps in the lives of our heroines. All of them have some problems and need the help of the main characters. It is the sick neighbour, or the sister worried about her kids, or a daughter and her friend.<br />I think one of the most interesting thing that happens to all three main character is the fact that they kiss another woman, and this make tehm change their minds. It's not a love kiss, it is just a silly one, just lips. But the effects are much stronger. Virginia decides that har Mrs Dalloway will kiss a woman either; Laura thows the horrible cake in the trash can; and Clarissa... well, she is a gay, so kissing another woman changed her mind years ago.<br />You may think it is a chick novel, but, definetely, it isn't. As a matter of fact, it is a book for grown ups, I don't mean you have to be old to get it, but you, surely, need some life experience in order to understand the character's fears and joys. What parent has never worried about a friend of his/her child (such as Clarissa, who does not like Mary Krull)? Or who has never wanted to give up his/her whole life a try something completely different as Laura and Virginia somehow?<br />Many people may feel a bit down after reading the book. Although the very begining and the last chapters deal with death, the book as a whole shows why we should choose life instead of just letting death take us. Even though Mrs Woolf has killed herself, she does not do it in that day. And we also learn near the end that Laura tried to kill herself either, but it didn't happen in the day told in the book. So 'the hours' of the described day are for celebrating life, more than this, they are to celebrate the option of choosing life!<br />All in all, it is an important book and I think that it deserves every single prize it won -- Pulitzer included. And more than this, it is a novel that deserves to be discovered more and more. If you haven't read &quot;Mrs Dalloway&quot; yet, you can enjoy &quot;The Hours&quot; a lot, but you'll feel very tempted to so afterwards.he Hours&quot; a lot, but you'll feel very tempted to so afterwards.
B00005U2LM|5.0|After two lackluster albums, the Wu is finally back with a real classic. Comparing all of their albums, I'd say that this is the one that comes closest to the infamous &quot;36 Chambers&quot;. While &quot;Forever&quot; was very disappointing, &quot;The W&quot; was much of an improvement, and now &quot;Iron Flag&quot; almost reaches the ranks of &quot;36 Chambers&quot;. The Wu reclaims the throne with some real bangers! <br />My personal faves are hard to name; this album is actually an album and not just a collection of tracks. The production is very diverse, and opening up the production to outside producers was definitely worth it. However, if I had to go with some tracks, I'd pick &quot;One of the days&quot;, &quot;Radioactive&quot;, &quot;Rules&quot; and &quot;Back in the game&quot;.<br />If you like the Wu-Tang Clan, You'll defintely love this album!
0618002251|5.0|This is the most excellent book I have ever opened. I have read various other books, including C.S. Lewis' Narnia series. They were great, but could never grasp the level of excitement, adventure, or just story, for example, than The Hobbit, and lord of the Rings series. I'm  not a crazy reader, but when I picked up the hobbit, right when I got home from school, went to my room, picked it up, and picked up where I left off. I finished them both in a total of 10 days! It has an awesome adventure plot. The Hobbits and co. set out with a 'king' to go recapture the perlious land of the misty Mountains, and the long silenced 'lonely mountain,'where Smaug the dragon lives. The Lord of the Rings is perhaps more exciting, but I have yet to finish. The first two books alone were the best I've ever read. Hopefully, they were just the cakewalk, so there is more excitement more to come! So far, The evil lord sauron seeks a ring that The hobbit got (you'll find out how) and wishes to capture it and rule evil over the whole middle earth. The hobbit must now throw the Ring into the pits of Doom, where the evel ring was wrought by the evil powers of Sauron Himself!!! THERES MORE, MUCH MORE, AND ITS BETTER! SO READ THE BOOK!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Okay, I admit it, Moulin Rouge is NOT for everyone.  Just reading through the reviews included here, people either seem to love it tremendously or hate it vehemently.  I fall into the former category, and after viewing the DVD and the plethora of bonus features, I am even more convinced that this movie is a masterpiece of directorial vision.<br />Some have complained that the music is not original.  Does it really matter, though, so long as the songs support the story?  Here, they support not only the story but the idealism of the characters and the world in which they live.<br />As Luhrmann explains on one of the many interviews with him on the DVD, the Moulin Rouge (the club, not the movie) was like a rave, like &quot;the greatest rave ever.&quot;  That not only sums up the Moulin Rouge, but also Luhrmann's approach to making this movie.  This movie is a rave, a bounty of sights and sound that will be immediately understood by the Generation X and Generation Y rave culture.<br />Aided by incredible performances by two leads who prove they have immensely appealing and powerful voices, Moulin Rouge completely defies expectations, even if one has seen the movie over and over again.<br />One has to tip a hat to 20th Century Fox, who took a page out of Dreamworks' book by releasing such an expansive DVD right at the start of awards season.  Like Dreamworks did with Gladiator last year, providing so many behind-the-scenes glimpses at the making of Moulin Rouge circumvents the Academy rules that you can't mail out anything other than the movie itself to Academy members.  Knowing that Academy members will scarf up this DVD in droves, 20th Century makes an excellent case for Moulin Rouge to get nominated for a bevy of Oscars, although admittedly most of these will probably be in the craft categories.  But those nominations will certainly be well-deserved.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I'm a 20 year old male, and as such I've always had an affinity for Britney Spears.  Originally it wasn't so much for her inspirational music, but more so for her tempting &quot;girl-next-door&quot; image.  As intriguing as she is, and as objective minded I am when it comes to music I took the liberty of learning about her -- what drives her, where she's coming from and where she's going.  I've been impressed the whole way.  She's a very grounded, down to Earth young lady who proves she's going to be a staple in the music industry for years to come with her 3rd album.  The domestic version features 5 songs Britney herself co-wrote and the entire recording is indicative how she's matured and how she has taken influences from other genres and blended them with her own. She explores new avenues with hip-hop type tracks like &quot;Boys&quot; and &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; while declaring her independence with &quot;Overprotected,&quot; &quot;Cinderella,&quot; \\"Let Me BE\\" and the endearing ballad &quot;Not a girl, Not Yet a Woman.&quot; She experiments with her funk groove in \\"Lonely\\" and the NSYNC influenced \\"What it's like to be me.\\"  And Not entirely abandoned are her bubble-gum roots with tracks like &quot;Anticipating&quot; and \\"That's Where you Take Me.\\"  Critics attack her image, style, and lack of talent.  Well, anyone who can put out 3 albums, selling over 45 million copies, perform in 4 of her own tours, record 12 music videos, make countless appearances on television shows, endless photo shoots, magazine interviews, start her own foundation, film a feature length movie, serve as grand marshal for a NASCAR race, make dozens of appearances on MTV, pull off an indelible VMA performance over which controversy still stirs, and then top that the following year, buy her own home while building one for her parents and maintaining an active, and remarkably private, personal life ALL before reaching the ripe old age of 20 HAS to be doing something right.  She is an exponentially talented young woman whose potential we've not yet begun to realize.ponentially talented young woman whose potential we've not yet begun to realize.
B00003CXXS|4.0|very pleasantly suprised.well worth a watch.surround sound also top notch.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This has to be the biggest surprise smash of '99. From the amazing brain-ride rollercoaster intro, throught to the explosive final sequence, this delievers on every level an then some! Pitt and Norton are both on top form as is Bonham Carter. The film's twist at the end beats the hell out of The Sixth Sense's! My new personal favourite: over taking Terminator 2!!!
B00003CXXJ|4.0|The DVD has a lot of great features on it, but some of them (like the games) are pretty useless. Still, it's fun to see the so called &quot;outtakes&quot; and the info on how they made the movie. The Gingerbread Man is your guide through a lot of the options, and his little statements are funny!  <br />I absolutely love how this movie takes shots at the giants of the family entertainment industry.  When you see the dressed up guard running through the snaked lines when he sees Shrek, be sure to catch the &quot;Wait from this point: 45 minutes&quot; sign.  That sure did bring back lots of thoughts of standing in the hot Florida sun waiting to get on a ride!  My favorite part of this entire movie is the smackdown at the end between Belle and Snow White. Make sure you catch it during the boquet toss!<br />If you just got your DVD player, this is a great first DVD to get.  The animation is great and fun, and the features will keep you busy and will spoil you!
0743216385|5.0|Stephen E. Ambrose gives a chilling and realistic account of serving in Americas finest war.  The truth that is spoken through Ambrose's research and many interviews with the actual men of the 506th is incomparable to anything I have ever read before.  This book is the most accurate book about World War II on bookshelves today.  Telling the tale of the 506th journey through training, Normandy, and the final capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest.  This book would appeal to the true WWII enthusiast, it features exerts from interviews with the men as well as the actual storyline.  However, this does make the book a little choppy and confusing at times. Along with the interviews, Ambrose does a tremendous job of explaining the characters and situations.  You really feel as though you on the front lines or in the fox hole with the men.  Through this realism, you begin to feel patriotic and as though you owe a great deal of thanks and respect for the men who paid such a price for our freedom.  <br />This is a tremendous book written by a renowned historical author.  You will be captivated by the words from the words of the mouths of the men who were there.  You will be exposed to a generation of people and a time that will entice you to learn more.  Most importantly though, you will gain a whole new perspective about the last great war.  The personal sacrifices by so many, the tales of heroism from those who came home, and the heart wrenching tales of the liberation of the German concentration camps.  A must read for those of you seeking a fantastic journey through American history.
B00005NWM3|2.0|Is it me or does Nickelback sound like any other rock band out there with the same old sound, same old look and same old production.<br />How their single &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; got to #1 in this country on Billboards Hot 100 singles chart is beyond MY COMPREHENSION.<br />I see this band on MTV, they have no personality, no style, no sound that I haven't heard before, further more it just instills in me that most of America is boring, mundane and like to listen to blase rock music.<br />With songs like &quot;In the End&quot; by Linkin Park that are scratching their way up the charts that have great vocals, great hooks, and even a little rap, or even J.Lo's &quot;Play&quot; which died at No.18 on the Hot 100- which is one of the best dance songs out in awhile- but yet her mundane &quot;Im Real&quot; goes to #1 on Billboards Hot 100, just shows that this country likes no challenges in their music.<BR>Just safe bets.  Which is just what Nickelback is.<br />The bands name is even average.  Nickelback just reminds me of a new millenium Night Ranger with mundane, been there done that rock songs &quot;Never Again&quot;, &quot;Hangnail&quot; and the how did it get to #1 in the first place &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;.<br />I am sure Nickelback will be a one-hit wonder, and even that is a feat all its own with this &quot;I have heard this before rock&quot;, that is why I give Nickelback (2 stars) instead of (1 star) for somehow bucking the system going all the way to #1 on Billboards Hot 100 with a mundane song with a mundane band.<br />Can someone tell the lead singer that it is almost 2002, and that 1980 is over, and to get a haircut.<br />Calling Vidal Sassoon, Calling Vidal Sassoon Come Right Away and Cut the Hair off that Baboon!

B00005NWRS|4.0|Ryan Adams arrives on the scene with &quot;Gold&quot;.   Adams with his country-rock flavor gives us a haunting look at New York City 4 days before the 9.11.01 attack on the world trade center in his single &quot;New York, New York&quot;.<br />I give Adams a lot of credit for keeping this video intact showing New York with all its glory before the horrible event, though it is haunting we cannot forget what happened or what was there, with Hollywood frantically adjusting all their New York filmed motion pictures adjusting the Trade Center as a non-entity is ridiculous i.e. &quot;Zoolander&quot; &amp; &quot;Serendipity&quot;.<br />Adams shows emotion and strength in his album &quot;Gold&quot;.  He puts a lot of soul into his music and you can feel it.  Though I could be mistaken- it looks like record execs let Ryan Adams do what HE CREATIVELY WANTED TO DO, without stepping in.<br />With songs like &quot;New York,New York&quot;, &quot;Firecracker&quot;, &quot;Sylvia Plath&quot; and the ever originial &quot;Tina Todedo's Street Walkin' Blues&quot; this CD shows a strong sense of artistry with a little bit of country and a little bit of rock.<br />The only downfall on Adams &quot;Gold&quot; is that a few songs become middle of the road I have heard this before tunes,...but nobody is perfect.<br />A very good album from a very talented artist.
0767020308|5.0|As compared with the Gwyneth Paltrow version, the A&amp;E version is by far the better &quot;Emma&quot;.  First, Kate Beckinsale was far better than Gwyneth in portraying the character.  Gwyneth didn't make me believe she was an 18th century aristocratic lady, whereas Kate did.  Second, the A&amp;E version better portrayed the relationship between Mr. Knightly and Emma.  Emma was much, much younger than Mr. Knightly, which was in keeping with the fashion of the day.  Third, the character development was superior in the A&amp;E version.  Lastly, the A&amp;E version was truer to the period than the one from Hollywood.<br />Bottom line, if you want a version of Emma that's truer to the period, go with the A&amp;E version.  If you want typical Hollywood fluff, go with either &quot;Clueless&quot; or the Gwyneth Paltrow version.
0920236162|2.0|I bought this book for my 3 year old for Christmas, but I'm not going to give it to her.  It's definitely for an older audience.  While it does send the message that girls don't have to be fairy princesses, it doesn't do it in a positive way.
0596000480|4.0|if you're a programmer or a computer language theory fan, this book is perfect. for the rest of us who just want to know how to use javascript, it's too much information. get this book after you get a basic understanding of javascript from the web or more newbie-friendly books. if not for another introduction to programming book i own, i don't think i would have grasped many of these concepts.
630460288X|5.0|This one of my all time favorite movies. It is definitely in my opinion, Stallone's best work. I have to tell you I have never been a Wesley Snipes fan, but this is by FAR his best role. Snipes actually stole the show, he is the funniest and at the same time scariest villian I have ran across. This one has it all, action, suspense, comedy, and a great script. Not to mention this DVD's picture and sound is AWESOME!
078322334X|1.0|This is probably the dumbest piece of celluloid I made the mistake to waste my time on, and that says a lot. I you find this entertaining - my condolences!
0743420373|4.0|(...) Overall I think the book is good and interesting but I don't think you are going to become a millionaire if you don't make a good living to begin with (what the authors call \\"good offense\\"). For example, if you make $7 or $10/hr, I don't see you becoming a millionaire. The strong work ethic, frugal living and investing are excellent ideas and anybody can apply them but they are not going to make you a millionaire if you earn say $20,000 a year.
B00004T9UF|5.0|There is no way to really tell you if you will like this album or not.  Everyone likes to blame everything on Eminem and Marilyn Manson because their albums are the way they are, but I believe they have every right to say whatever they want to say.  My only advice for you is to listen to the album and not let others tell you if you should like it or not.
0399236201|5.0|I highly recommend this book! This book of fiction is a real thriller that takes you on an exciting adventure full of twists and turns.  What is most fun about this book is that the hero of the story is only fourteen years old!  If you like James Bond and would like to read about a kid who does the things he does, then this book is for you!
0517123207|5.0|I believe this book is well written.  Darwin doesn't overload you with endless facts and information which would bore you to death and distract you from understanding his essential theories.  Not that facts and tests are irrelevant.  He has done tests and has lots of data, but he keeps this separately for those who wish to build upon his theories or dispute them.  He uses just a few examples to prove his points, and the results are remarkable.<br />There are several points in time which have changed the way people look upon the world around us.  Finding out the world is not flat, but rather round is one.  The Earth revolves around the Sun, rather than the reverse, and that all of the continents used to all be connected at one time, are a few more.  Darwin's Theory of evolution rates right up there with these.  For someone believing that the world evolved from Adam and Eve I can't imagine how upset he made these people feel by suggesting that we may have evolved from Monkeys, or some amphibian creature.  Darwin's theories that animals (humans included) may have evolved from just four or five different progenitors, and that plants may have evolved from even fewer, or that we all may have evolved from just one species is fascinating.  I believe he approaches it just the right way.  He doesn't argue or criticize.  He just lays it out there and you are forced to acknowledge it.  Darwin keeps religion our of the equation.  If religious groups want to go on there to name the amphibian being which crawled out of the ocean for the first time onto land Adam, that would probably be all right with him, so long as you admitted that their probably was such a being.<br />Science has improved since Darwin's day's and geology and archeology has improved, but he is still correct that we will not be able to find perfect fossils after all of these years to match all of the changes.  Some of his other thoughts and comments I do not know whether to contribute to the period in which he wrote them to or just as preliminary thoughts that the actual tests would disprove.<br />For instance, Darwin mentions that he believes characteristics are only passed down to males to make them more capable of obtaining a mate and reproducing.  Characteristics such as increased strength, brighter colors, and the ability to sing.  However I would believe that other or similar traits would be passed down to the females as well to make them more attractive to male suitor, forcing them to want to fight over these particular females more than others.<br />Also Darwin mentions that the strongest produce the most descendants.  In our society today that is not necessarily true.  Money is associated with power or strength.  Someone who has two kids may have more money and be considered to have more power.  Since they live within their means they may be able to afford a better house, and to put their kids through colleges, as opposed to a family with seven kids in which they live by lesser means, and are unable to afford the same amenities as the family with just two kids, because they have less money to go around.  The family with seven kids by this example may not be considered the strongest since they have more money, but yet they have the most descendants.he wrote them to or just as preliminary thoughts that the actual tests would disprove.<br />For instance, Darwin mentions that he believes characteristics are only passed down to males to make them more capable of obtaining a mate and reproducing.

B00005RFAI|5.0|In Tody's World of Often Flavor Of The Week Pop acts Pink provides much more. From her single, get this party started I expected fast catchy songs, instead finding songs where sometimes the lyrics were as good as the song. The album title truly is fitting and I highly reccomend this album.<BR>P.S, my favortie song is Dear Diary
B00003CXXS|2.0|It's quite clear from the first 10 minutes that the author was not involved with this film.  I wish I could say that the dinosaurs looked real, that the plot was believable (even for fiction), and that the ending was a show-stopper...but then I'd be lying through my teeth.  The edge, the excitement, and the awe from JP-1 left the building when JP-3 arrived.  Even the \\"mighty Raptors\\" couldn't deliver this story from sequel/trilogy hell; one can only milk the intelligence of these creatures for so many movies, and then it just gets ridiculous. (...)
B00005JKES|5.0|Incredibly clear dvd ... I too wish the pilot was there, but it's easy to get one from ebay.  Not as clear as this one, but at least you'll own it on dvd.  Looking forward to the second season ...
B00005B6NC|4.0|That was my question the first time I saw &quot;Pitch Black&quot;.  I thought the movie itself was okay...but then I watched it again months later, and it grew on me.  The special effects (namely, the &quot;Night Freaks&quot;) were a welcome change from the faltering monsters of the Alien Saga, which have seriously lost their edge of the first two installments.  The portrait of our human condition was interesting to see, too, as people from different walks of life are thrown into a strange situation and show their true colors (kind of like &quot;Survivor&quot;, but better).<br />Yet it is Mr. Diesel's portrayal of Riddick that really made the movie.  Sharp, witty, lethal, and (for the ladies), very pleasant eye-candy...yet still human despite being treated and regarded as something less.  Riddick is one of the classic anti-heroes, someone you shouldn't cheer for, but you find yourself doing it anyway.<br />On the star scale, I give this movie a 4; it's not the absolute worst, and it's not the absolute best (what is?)...but it's damn good all the same.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Eagerly anticipating the film version of 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' I picked this CD up two days ago.  It hasn't left my CD player since.  The score is up there with the best of the best, like &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter,&quot; and Enya's contributions are simply heartbreaking, &quot;May It Be&quot; ranking among the best end-title songs I've heard, beating out even Phil Collins' end title version of &quot;You'll Be in My Heart&quot; for Tarzan.<br />Attracted to the score from a theatrical trailer for 'Fellowship,' it's now one of my favorite CDs, even not having read the book (which I plan to do before seeing the actulal film.)  I can't wait for the score to &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King.&quot;<br />Other reccomended scores: Star Wars series, Harry Potter, Shrek*. Remember the Titians*, Tarzan<br />*=Unfortunately, very little of the actulal score can be found on the corrasponding soundtrack album for the perticular reccomendation title.
B00005A46T|5.0|This is metal, pure and simple.  I see a lot of reviews from death metal fans touting their nobody / never-heard-of-them-and-never-will bands (i.e. At The Gates, Soilwork, Cannibal Corpse, etc.) over Slipknot.  I'm truly suprised that they know how to use the internet, let alone found the time to break away from their small animal mutilation duties to come and write a review on this website. <br />Metal / hardcore fans, please ignore them. This is a fabulous piece of work from one of the best hardcore metal bands out there today (along with Slayer).  In my opinion, this is superior to their 1st CD and one of the very best metal releases of the year.<br />Can't we all just get along?  Guess not.
0792835700|5.0|Overall, a great escape. Get lost in the highlands of Scotland with Gene Kelly and Van Johnson. My favorite scene is back in New York in their regular haunt where Van Johnson is trying to retain space for himself at the crowded bar by placing full drinks and lit cigarettes in the ashtrays to either side of him. Someone mentions the weather while jostling him and Van replies, &quot;It's not the heat, it's the humanity!&quot;

B000050XEI|5.0|Personally, I thought that it was an excellent CD.  It is an awesome CD filled with great relaxation-meditation music.  Another great Enya CD!
B00004T9UF|2.0|When the song was out, I really liked the sound of &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; and so I made my decision to buy the entire album on this one track.  My mistake.  The problem for me was that this just was not my style of music, harder white-boy rap.  If you are in to rap you might enjoy this album, but if you are buying it just for the afore-mentioned track... try and find the single or buy some sort of compilation with the song on it.
B00005QK3W|4.0|This is the best Paul McCartney album in about 20 years.<BR>Absolutely fantastic.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I almost didn't rent or buy this movie because of all of the negative reviews I heard after its release in the theater.  After watching the movie, I have learned that reviews do not always depict the actual quality of a movie.  This movie was excellent! I am not a &quot;war story&quot; kind of person; I very rarely watch historical-based films. However, the writer/producer did an outstanding job in this movie.<br />The love story made the film more realistic and interesting; it &quot;brought home&quot;  the personal aspects of the men who fought in the war.<br />I would recommend this movie to everyone. If you liked the Titanic, you'll love this.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Yes, it's ridiculous, contrived, excessive, absurd, outrageous, and quite possibly a masterpiece. I cannot think of any film maker, other than Luhrmann, who could have pulled this one off, let alone have done it so masterfully. The bonus featurette disc alone would be worth the price. Forget your pre-conceived notions, buckle your seat belts, you haven't been here before, no matter how familiar the landscape, tunes and thematics may seem.
6300263673|4.0|This movie is so fun, the dancing is just so enjoyable to watch and the love affair between actors Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey is so real. The way they moved together playfully but professionally was capitivating. The movie was mainly positive and upbeat except for the thread of social prejudice that comes between actors Patrick and Jennifer. The modern dances mixed with the older steps all blended so well together. I haven't seen a dance movie of this calibre in a long time. I saw Moulin Rouge but it just doesn't live up to this one. The visuals in Moulin Rouge are really stunning but Dirty Dancing has more chemistry between the two actors and the dance numbers just seem better to me! Well, needless to say, a must see!!<br />Lisa Nary

B00005RDAF|4.0|all, in all, a good dvd.  the title is deceiving because there are only 3 actual videos on here, only two of which are from britney the cd.  kind of upsetting since she will most likely have 5 videos off this album.  but, it's stuff fans have already seen except for a behind the scenes of crossroads with interviews only.  but if you love the slave video and performance at the vmas 2001, it's a must have.
0446608955|5.0|The book A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks has to be one of the best books I have ever read.  It is a loving story that fills you with all kinds of emotions.  This is a love story that tugs at the heartstrings.  I would say that this book is aimed more at a female audience.  Because of its length and vocabulary I would say that it could be read by people of many ages.  Young and old girls alike will love this book.<BR> The plot of this book was very well thought out.  The rising action is leading you up to the point of whether or not the two young leads, Landon and Jamie, will fall in love.  They face many difficulties along the way.  Many people are looking down on Landon for being with Jamie because she's not the coolest girl around.  She's a do-gooder and loves to read the Bible.  When these two finally fall in love the author hits you with a very unexpected turn.  Nicholas Sparks used a lot of foreshadowing and direct characterization to get his point across.  At one point in the book, Jamie says she won't go out with Landon unless he promises not to fall in love with her.  The book puts out the idea that we shouldn't judge others by outward appearances.  We should get to know someone before you write him or her off.<BR> This book stirred up many emotions.  I felt sorry for Jamie that no one really knew who she was or all that she was facing.  I felt angry that the young people of the town looked down on her when all she was doing was being a good person.  I felt so happy when Landon admitted to Jamie that he was in love with her.  The book almost brought me to tears at the end.  I won't give away the ending, but it was really moving.<BR> My overall impression was that this was a great book with a great message.  It follows the life of two teenagers both going through a great change in their lives.  They get to feel what it's like to be in love and to lose.  Through the whole book I was rooting for them to get together.  When they finally did I couldn't believe how it was all to end.  All I can say is that I loved this book and would read it again in a second.
6302561868|5.0|this is a great powerful film i was dissapointed that newt and hocks died but owell the storyis great weaver does one of the best performances a actor good do.a strong ending this a must see.
